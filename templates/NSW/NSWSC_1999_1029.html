50258/1996 - HUNGRY JACK'S PTY LIMITED v BURGER KING CORPORATION &amp; ANOR
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

Introduction
<P>

1   	The plaintiff, Hungry Jack's Pty Limited, ("HJPL"), for
which Mr T.F. Bathurst of Queen's Counsel, Mr N.C. Hutley of Senior
Counsel and
Mr T.D. Castle of Counsel appeared, is a subsidiary of Competitive Foods
Australia Pty Limited, ("CFAL").  Mr John James
Cowin is the Chairman and
Managing Director of both companies and has had, at all material times, the
effective day to day control
of them and other companies within the Competitive
Foods Group.  He was generally referred to in the evidence as "Jack Cowin" or
"Jack".
<P>

2   	He established that Group in about 1969, and various
companies within it own and operate some 190 fast food restaurants in
Australia
trading as "Hungry Jack's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken", and 128 home delivery
pizza units in Queensland, the Northern
Territory, Tasmania, New South Wales
and Western Australia trading as "Domino's".  The Group operates five food
manufacturing and
processing plants, which sell products within Australia and
export them to approximately eighteen countries.
<P>

3   	The interests in the Group are held as to 55.5 per cent by
companies associated with Mr Cowin, 29.6 per cent by three Japanese
companies,
and 14.9 per cent by a number of Canadian investors.  The business interests of
HJPL are substantial and, as at 18 November
1996, when the first defendant,
Burger King Corporation, ("BKC"), for which Mr B.C. Oslington of Queen's
Counsel and Mr M.R. Ellicott
of Counsel appeared, served two notices purporting
to terminate a Development Agreement entered into between BKC and HJPL on 13
November
1990, HJPL operated 148 restaurants in Australia trading under the
name "Hungry Jack's"; third party franchisees owned and operated
18 other
restaurants trading under that name to which HJPL provided services; HJPL
operated 2 test restaurants at service station
sites controlled by the Shell
Company of Australia Limited, ("Shell"), under the name "Hungry Jack's"; and
HJPL had paid royalties
of approximately $20.8m to BKC since 15 November 1990.
During the twelve months to December 1997, HJPL paid royalties of approximately
$4.48m to BKC.  As at 30 June 1997, it employed some 8,900 people in Australia,
and its sales for that financial year were in the
order of $218m.  
<P>

4   	Mr Oslington and Mr Ellicott also appeared for the third
defendant, Burger King Australia Pty Limited, ("BKAL").  There were
no discrete
issues between it and HJPL.  At the commencement of the hearing the proceedings
between HJPL and the second defendant,
Shell, were settled.
<P>

5   	In 1969 Mr Cowin became interested in obtaining the
franchise for the Burger King System in Australia and New Zealand.  BKC,
which
is an American corporation based in Miami and which has been at all material
times a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan plc,
commenced trading in America in
1955.  It developed a comprehensive fast food restaurant franchising system,
("the Burger King System"
or "the System"), which consists of an overall
restaurant format and operating system.  The System "dictates a large number of
aspects
of running a restaurant, including recipes, food preparation, product
specification, interior and exterior restaurant appearance,
required furniture,
fixtures and equipment, required maintenance, trade and product names, cleaning
procedures, staff training and
uniforms, and method of service".
<P>

6   	BKC, which is currently the second largest world-wide food
hamburger chain after McDonald's, operates restaurants, which it
owns, and
grants licences or franchises to third parties to operate limited menu
restaurants using the System, from which franchisees
it derives royalties.  By
July 1998 there were approximately 8,900 restaurants operating in 53 countries
of which some 900 were owned
and operated by BKC and the remainder were
licensed or franchised BKC outlets.  HJPL has been, at all material times, its
largest
franchisee outside the United States. All BKC franchises are conducted
pursuant to franchise agreements which, subject to differences
in local law,
have essentially the same terms throughout the world.  These agreements are
designed to ensure that each Burger King
outlet offers a substantially uniform
menu, conforms to an identifiable restaurant image, and delivers the Burger
King System at
uniformly high levels of quality, service and cleanliness.  It
is perceived to be commercially important that customers will identify
Burger
King restaurants, wherever they may be, as having the characteristics and
qualities which BKC requires, and BKC believes that
its success is due to its
outlets delivering quality, service and cleanliness, ("QSC"), "on the highest
level".
<P>

7   	BKC, to ensure compliance with its standards, employs
people to assess the level of adherence by each franchisee to the standards
specified in the franchise agreements and its various Operations Manuals.
<P>

8   	Save in Australia, BKC restaurants trade under the name
"Burger King".  In Australia that name and "Hungry Jack's", which trade
mark
BKC owns, are used.  All HJPL restaurants trade under the name "Hungry Jack's".

<P>

9   	Mr Cowin's successful attempt to obtain non-exclusive
franchise rights for Burger King operations in Australia is traced in
paragraphs 10 to 22 and 24 to 27 of his witness statement of 29 January 1998,
which is part of Exhibit Q.  As those matters were
not in issue, it is
sufficient to note that for almost twenty years Selden Pty Limited, ("Selden"),
which was also a company essentially
controlled by Mr Cowin, and HJPL, which
was, in effect, Selden's successor, built up the business in Australia by
opening restaurants,
initially in Western Australia and South Australia, and
thereafter in most other States and Territories.  These activities were
financed
mainly from bank borrowings and cash flow and the rate of development,
particularly from 1970 to about 1987, was linked to the annual
performance of
the existing "Hungry Jack's" restaurants and influenced by general economic
conditions.
<P>

10   	BKC's principal decision-making body is an Executive
Committee in Miami.  There are three main functional arms.  The development
arm
is responsible for seeking out new development opportunities.  The operations
arm is responsible for supervising the operations
of restaurants and market
areas.  There is also a finance and legal arm.  Because of the potential for
conflict between the aspirations
of those working for BKC in these various
areas, fairly definite demarcation lines are applied.
<P>

11   	Prior to 1989 or 1990 BKC did not have any real presence
in Australia, save through HJPL, and, whilst it required HJPL to
adhere to the
various agreements into which the parties had entered, it was, generally
speaking, content to allow HJPL to develop
the businesses as it saw fit and
basically conformably with the various contractual obligations.  This led to
HJPL's becoming, at
least to BKC's perception, somewhat autonomous and,
apparently as a result of that, to BKC's taking a more active interest in the
way in which HJPL was operating.  This new activity on BKC's part led, at least
to some extent, to further disagreements between
the companies, there having
been earlier ones which led to agreements being entered into in the 1980's,
and, on 13 November 1990,
they entered into four agreements, which are central
to the present litigation, namely a Settlement Agreement to which was annexed
a
Franchise Agreement, a Development Agreement, a Service Agreement and a
Registered User Agreement.  On 12 December 1991 and 26
February 1993 agreements
were entered into to amend the Service Agreement.
<P>

12   	Prior to August 1994, BKC had very limited permanent staff
in Australia.  On 1 June 1994 BKAL was incorporated and, from August
1994, BKC
conducted its operations, to some extent, through BKAL employees.  BKAL's
initial directors were Mr Blauer, who was based
outside Australia, and Mr
Horowitz, who was based in Australia, and both of whom worked in the
operations' area.  From July 1994,
BKC increased its presence in Australia by
the employment of a specialist development manager, Mr A.P. Power, and 6
specialist operations
staff under the direction of Mr Horowitz.  There was also
a Quality Assurance Manager, Mr Mark Smith, and a Director of Marketing,
Mr
Marc Gough.  The BKAL employees reported to their superiors in the particular
functional groups in BKC.  Mr David Fitzjohn was
the principal BKC employee
responsible for development in a region, which took in Australia, and Mr Colt
Hothorn, a BKC employee,
was responsible to him.  Mr Power was, at least
initially, responsible for operations in the region, which included Australia.
Mr
Frank Miolla is and was, at all material times, a lawyer employed by BKC
with special interest in, inter alia, Australia. The principal
BKC employee
concerned with finance was Mr Gooden to whom Mrs Driscoll answered.  Mr
Fitzjohn and Mr Miolla were Vice-Presidents
of BKC based in Miami and the
former sat on the Executive Committee.  Mr Gooden and Mrs Driscoll worked in
Miami and Mr Hothorn was
based in London.
<P>

13   	After the entry into the agreements of 13 December 1990
there were further disputes between the parties over a range of issues.
 By
approximately 1992 BKC was contemplating "buying out" HJPL or arranging for a
third party to do so. Consideration was also being
given to a joint venture,
which would be controlled by BKC.  The various issues led to a flood of
correspondence and memoranda, most
of which seems to have been tendered,
raising allegations, counter allegations and responses.  There were further
attempts to resolve
the differences, all of which failed.  By the latter part
of 1995 it seems to have been accepted that HJPL would not agree to any
form of
a "buy out" or joint venture, thus leaving the parties in a state of
disagreement with no real prospect of a commercial settlement,
which is the
only effective method by which the situation between them can be resolved.  I
doubt that my resolution of the particular
issues tendered for decision will
determine the overall commercial problems between the parties.
<P>

14   	A particular area of dispute concerns the relationship
developed between HJPL, BKC and Shell.  This involved several elements
after
initial discussions between HJPL and Shell, and BKC and Shell.  One was the
negotiation for and subsequent entry into a tripartite
test development
agreement, pursuant to which several restaurants would be opened at Shell
controlled service station sites to see
whether the co-branding of petroleum
products and a fast food restaurant would be successful, and also the extent to
which the three
companies could work together in that venture.  Although the
agreement was signed in February 1995 and exchanged in March 1995, the
parties
had been pursuing the arrangements since late 1993 or early 1994.  The parties
proceeded with the test on the basis that
if it was successful they would enter
into a long-term relationship for the development of a number of restaurants at
Shell sites.
 Shell suggested there may be as many as 70.  HJPL's case was that
prior to the entry into that agreement, the parties were working
towards the
formation of a long-term relationship for the mutual financial benefit of each.
It is alleged by HJPL that BKC and Shell,
contrary to the spirit and intent of
that agreement and the arrangement for the long-term relationship, and thus in
breach of a fiduciary
duty allegedly owed to HJPL, sought to deal with each
other to achieve the same end but to the exclusion of HJPL.  The submission
was
that the evidence established that prior to 1994 Shell had been dealing
separately with each of BKC and HJPL because it was interested
in introducing
fast food restaurants at its service station sites.  By March 1994 the parties
came together to seek to develop the
test agreement and long-term arrangement
to which I have referred.  Subsequently, and it will be necessary to consider
the evidence
in detail, Shell advised BKC that it was not prepared to go ahead
if HJPL was involved. BKC did not seek to change Shell's attitude
on this and,
on one view, encouraged it not to proceed with HJPL, whilst pursuing
arrangements for Shell to enter into an arrangement
with it.  BKC did not
advise HJPL of its attitude, nor of Shell's, until Mr Fitzjohn wrote to Mr
Cowin on 15 May 1995. Although BKC
had been aware of Shell's attitude to HJPL
for some months prior to May 1995, it not only did not advise HJPL of it, but
it allowed
HJPL to continue with the test arrangements, with the expense and
time that involved, in the knowledge that Shell was stating that
it would not
participate in a long term dealing with HJPL.  When BKC told HJPL of the
position in May 1995, the tension between the
two was heightened. Thereafter
BKC sought to improve its own position in Australia through Shell to the
disadvantage of HJPL.  On
the basis of these submissions HJPL has put that BKC
and Shell breached fiduciary duties to it as a consequence of which it is
entitled
to equitable compensation from BKC.
<P>

15   	During much of the period when the disputes were
flourishing, a senior executive of HJPL, Mr J. Montgomery, who was its
Development
Manager, was furnishing confidential information to BKC about
HJPL's and Mr Cowin's affairs and suggesting steps which BKC might
take, which,
in Mr Montgomery's opinion, would bring pressure to bear on HJPL and Mr Cowin
of a type which would assist BKC in its
aims to force HJPL to sell out or enter
into some form of a joint venture.  Mr Montgomery advised BKC of what he
perceived to be
commercial weaknesses in HJPL, which BKC could exploit for its
own purposes, those purposes being, in essence, to increase BKC's
presence in
Australia and, if possible, to arrange for some form of "take-over" of HJPL by
a "buy out".  Mr Montgomery was trusted
by Mr Cowin to the knowledge of BKC's
officers.  The submission was that his furnishing of such information was done,
to the knowledge
of BKC, without Mr Cowin's authority; that BKC was prepared
to, and did, receive and use it to its advantage in dealing with HJPL;
and that
this was both thoroughly discreditable conduct on the part of Mr Montgomery,
and reflected no credit on the  BKC's officers
willing to receive and act on
the information.  Those particularly involved were Mr Fitzjohn, Mr Miolla and
Mr Power.  Each of them
had the qualifications and understanding to appreciate,
and, I am satisfied, did appreciate, that what Mr Montgomery was doing was
commercially and morally wrong.  None did anything to stop it, to advise Mr
Cowin of Mr Montgomery's activities, or to stop the use
of the information by
BKC.
<P>

16   	Mr Montgomery, who, I was informed from the Bar Table
without objection, is still employed by HJPL, was not called, although
it is
difficult to think of any plausible reason he could have offered for his
conduct, if it bears the characterisation for which
Mr Bathurst contended.  It
was submitted that the attempted explanations of various officers of BKC,
including Messrs Fitzjohn, Miolla
and Power, as to why they continued to
receive the information, in an effort to excuse what, save for one explanation,
they acknowledged,
albeit in some instances with the benefit of hindsight, was
otherwise highly discreditable conduct on their part, should not be accepted.
The explanations included that no use was made of the information; that it was
thought it was being planted as a negotiating ploy
with authority; and that it
was part of "a good cop, bad cop" strategy engineered by Mr Cowin, in an
endeavour to obtain a better
bargaining position.  The other explanation
proffered was that Mr Montgomery appreciated that HJPL was experiencing
substantial difficulties
because of Mr Cowin's lack of management skills and
advised BKC of them with a genuine desire that BKC would help to right the
situation
for the ultimate good of HJPL.  The suggestion that Mr Cowin lacked
such skills, having regard to the business he had built up, is
simply not
credible.
<P>

17   	I am able to state my conclusions about these explanations
immediately.  Each was, in my opinion, fanciful, and nothing more
than <i>ex
post facto</i> reasoning in an attempt to justify conduct, which, at a level of
basic commercial morality, was unjustifiable to their clear understanding.
 I
am satisfied that those officers of BKC who sought to resort to hindsight
appreciated the significance of what they and Mr Montgomery
were doing at the
time it was occurring.  I have no doubt that Mr Montgomery was passing on the
information and offering the advice,
which he requested the officers of BKC to
keep confidential with which requests they complied, for some perceived benefit
to BKC
and/or himself and not to benefit HJPL, and that the officers of BKC,
who received it, were content to do so and use it to advance
BKC's position.
There were compelling examples of Mr Montgomery's advice being followed,
shortly after it was received, by BKC. 
I do not consider that this was merely
coincidental.  The receipt by Mr Power from Mr Montgomery of detailed internal
financial papers
of HJPL and other companies within the Group, to which Mr
Power knew that neither he nor Mr Montgomery was not entitled, and,
notwithstanding
that lack of entitlement, Mr Power's analysis of them and his
subsequent recommendations to BKC based on them, showed the length
to which BKC
was prepared to go to use the material to seek to undermine the position of
HJPL.  In so far as this finding involves
criticism of the commercial conduct
of the officers of BKC to whom I have referred, I am totally satisfied that it
is justified by
the evidence, including their ineffective attempts to explain
what they did in any plausible fashion.  In so far as the comments
are critical
of Mr Montgomery, I have taken into account that he was not called by any party
and was, therefore, not given the opportunity
to make an explanation.  However,
having full regard to that, I am unable to see how he could have explained what
he did in any way
which would deflect the criticism which such conduct, in my
opinion, deserves.  These findings make it necessary to consider the
evidence
of those BKC officers with great care, particularly in so far as they denied
improper motives.
<P>

18   	The matters to which I have referred were carried out in
the context of BKC's wishing to regain control of the Australian
market.
Therefore, the conclusions to which I have come about the receipt and use of Mr
Montgomery's material is supported not only
by the adverse views I formed of
the attempted explanations, but also by the probabilities. The information
furnished by Mr Montgomery
was obviously intended to further BKC's end.  I have
not the slightest doubt that from at least December 1993, when Mr Fitzjohn
wrote
a lengthy memorandum to the Chief Executive Officer, Mr J. Adamson, BKC
embarked on a deliberate strategy to win back that market,
which it
acknowledged it had lost through its own neglect, and that in pursuance of that
aim it pursued a policy of  confining, disrupting
and thwarting the activities
of HJPL to the extent that it was within its interests to do so.  A problem for
BKC was that it was
still very much dependent on HJPL to provide the
infrastructure necessary for the continued successful conduct of the business
in
Australia. The contractual arrangements, into which BKC had entered with
HJPL on 13 November 1990, also provided BKC with another
difficulty.  In so far
as BKC officers denied that their objective and that of BKC was to affect HJPL
in the manner to which I have
referred, I accept Mr Bathurst's submission that
I should reject their evidence.  In my opinion, BKC considered that its way
forward
in Australia would be much assisted by restricting HJPL's activities as
much as possible.
<P>

19   	The memorandum of 1993 is instructive in understanding the
changing attitude of BKC towards HJPL.  It addressed a question,
which had
previously arisen so far as BKC was concerned, namely that BKC had allowed HJPL
to, in effect, control the market in Australia
in circumstances where the
Burger King mark was subordinated to that of Hungry Jack's.  The visit to which
Mr Fitzjohn referred in
that memorandum was one he made to Sydney in August
1993.  The memorandum commenced with the observation that:-
<P>

"The idea that Australia is incapable of any BKC activity to drive development
and that we have to rely on our franchisee to determine
our place in the market
is not only incorrect but dangerous.  We are at a crossroads and need to make a
directional decision.  Even
a decision to do nothing demands an understanding
of our history in the market, our current competitive status, and future
opportunities.
 There are real pro-active alternatives to a laissez-faire
approach which merit consideration."
<P>

20   	Mr Fitzjohn referred to the failure of BKC to express a
strategic direction  for Australia and New Zealand, and recounted
the history
of HJPL, noting that from 1973 to 1989 it was "de facto an exclusive
territorial franchisee in Australia as BKC made
no attempt to insert any
others".  He continued that HJPL and the Australian market received little
attention "from Miami", and that
Mr Cowin went his own way and over time
acquired certain rights to all BKC's trademarks "due to our failure to
supervise his activities,
and attend to legal affairs of BKC in Australia".

<P>

21   	The memorandum dealt with the settlement in 1990 and to
the fact that:-
<P>

"Unfortunately, BKC failed to enforce its rights under the 1990 settlement
agreements and Jack was once again left without supervision
or assistance
between 1990 and early 1992.  Although a variety of trademark and menu issues
were resolved in 1993, BKC missed an
opportunity to improve its relationship
with HJ and reinforced Jack's belief that BKC is not interested in or committed
to the Australian
market."
<P>

22   	He referred to Mr Cowin's belief that he had never
obtained any support from BKC, and to the fact that his very use of the
name
"Hungry Jack's" indicated how little support and brand value the System had
been able to provide to the Australian market "over
the last twenty years".  He
continued:-
<P>

"Under the new Agreement HJ has a non-exclusive right to develop anywhere in
Australia except institutional locations.  BKC cannot
grant an exclusive
territory to any other franchisee, and indeed large target areas could arguably
violate HJ's rights.  However
the Agreement is specifically designed to allow
BKC to participate in, or even to lead the process of recruiting third party
franchisees."
<P>

23   	Mr Fitzjohn, at p.3, wrote:-
<P>

"Since 1990 HJ continued to develop and the process of third party franchisee
recruitment has begun, although its current status
leaves much to be desired,
if BKC's aim is adequate penetration of the Australian market.  BKC is
currently discussing recruiting
guidelines with Jack, but he continues to
resist any effort by BKC to approve or participate in the process of assigning
target areas
or locations to third party franchisees.  HJ is `pacing'
development and in my judgment deliberately `spreading' franchisees to ensure
absolutely no encroachment on its own restaurants.
<P>

I sense that in certain areas there is a resentment of Jack Cowin's
advantageous position with BKC.  BKC has no one to blame but
itself in 1990,
and thereafter for having ignored the Australian market and largely left the
franchisee to its own devices.  We continue
to pay the penalty for that
laissez-faire attitude over twenty years."
<P>

Thus, Mr Fitzjohn was pointing out the difficulty in BKC's penetrating the
Australian market whilst HJPL retained its contractual
rights.
<P>

24   	Mr Fitzjohn traced the position as it then existed and
referred to the absence of any strategy for Australia.  He also considered
encroachment and, at p.7, under the heading:-
<P>

"So - What To Do?",
<P>

he set forth various alternatives including avoiding Sydney, which he
considered to be a defeatist option; maintaining the status
quo; or becoming
pro-active, which he considered must be an alternative if either of the next
two suggestions could not be achieved.
 They were:-
<P>

"(4)	<u>Purchase HJ</u> - this would clearly give us the opportunity to
internalise a substantial profit flow.  With the business currently netting
some
nine million Australian dollars.  It is clear from the discussions I have
had with Jack Cowin that his valuation of the business
and the real estate it
controls will be substantially in excess of any multiplier we would place on
that figure.  I do not believe
that a purchase of HJ could be a long term
strategy, and it would be a buy to sell rather than a buy to hold.  ...
<P>

  (5)	Get someone else to buy HJ - clearly this option and (4) above may be
interchangeable assuming we would only buy to sell and
this option will be more
complex although less risky for us.
<P>

  ..."
<P>

25   	Thus, from December 1993, the idea was being promoted by
Mr Fitzjohn that either BKC or another party should buy out HJPL,
in the
context that the business was obviously financially desirable.  The memorandum
pointed out that the "business" was one of
some worth either to BKC on a "buy
to sell" basis, or to a third party.  These comments are  inconsistent with the
later assertions
of BKC that Mr Cowin was not running the business in an
efficient and appropriate manner.  His recommendations included making an
open
offer to HJPL to purchase and to establish whether terms could be agreed.  He
thought that given the past history this would
be likely to be "a frustrating
and prolonged process as actually getting Jack Cowin to commit will be at very
least extremely difficult".
 He also considered providing Coles Myer Limited
with further information.
<P>

26   	The disputes led to numerous meetings, threats to
terminate the agreements and several mediations.  No settlement or resolution
was forthcoming and, having served Notices of Default on 21 March 1996 under
the Development and Service Agreements, which were not
pursued, BKC, on 18
November 1996, served two Notices, "the Shorter Notice" and "the Longer
Notice", each purporting to terminate
the Development Agreement.  Subsequently,
on 12 September 1997, it served a further Notice purporting to terminate the
Development
Agreement, such Notice being stated to be without prejudice to
whatever rights BKC may have pursuant to the November 1996 Notices.
 The
Development Agreement was the one which BKC found the most irksome, as it not
only provided for HJPL's continued long-term development
of restaurants by
itself and through franchisees it introduced, but it also restricted, to a
certain extent, BKC's ability to develop
in Western Australia, South Australia
and Queensland by allowing HJPL to object to restaurants being opened if it
took the view that
that would lead to "encroachment" on HJPL's restaurants in
those States.
<P>

27   	A critical issue is the validity of these Notices.  That
is challenged as a matter of construction of the various agreements,
in the
sense that HJPL did not comply with the contractual requirements entitling it
to give the Notices; and on the bases that in
so far as HJPL is in breach and
the Notices were otherwise valid, BKC is precluded from relying on those
breaches because of waiver,
estoppel and by the application of the principles
of reasonableness and good faith, terms which are said to be implied in the
agreement.
<P>

The Issues
<P>

28   	The pleadings were voluminous.  I am acquitted from a
detailed examination of them by the parties' agreement that the issues
fought
were covered by them, although it will be necessary to refer to some of them.
Therefore, I shall set out those issues.  I
have referred to a principal issue
being whether the various Notices terminated the Development Agreement and to
sub-issues arising
thereunder.  It was not ultimately submitted that if BKC was
successful on the termination issue, that the franchise agreements and
the
Service Agreement were thereby terminated, it being stated by Mr Oslington that
an assertion that the Service Agreement had been
"frustrated" was not
pursued.
<P>

29   	I find Mr Bathurst's formulation of the issues, which I
shall now set out in part, a useful summary of many of the matters
raised for
determination.  I do not, however, propose to decide all of them, but only
those necessary to resolve the main areas of
dispute.
<P>

"<i>Termination of the Development Agreement</i>
<P>

(a)	<u>The construction issue</u> - namely, whether BKC's attempts to terminate
the Development Agreement were invalid because, on the true construction of the
Development
Agreement, BKC was not entitled to terminate that agreement:
<P>

(i)	in respect of a breach of clause 2.1;
<P>

(ii)	alternatively, without giving HJPL a notice to cure under clause 15.2, in
respect of a breach of clause 2.1; and
<P>

(iii)	further, without giving HJPL a notice to cure under clause 15.2 in
respect of each of the alleged breaches relied on in the
Longer Notice and in
the September 1997 notice.
<P>

(b)	<u>Waiver/election</u> - whether, BKC's attempt to terminate the
Development Agreement by the Longer Notice was invalid, because BKC had
affirmed the Development
Agreement and waived its right to terminate the
Development Agreement in respect of each of the breaches relied on in the
Longer
Notice.
<P>

(c)	Breach of implied terms - whether, in respect of the Development
Agreement:
<P>

(i)	There were implied terms of the<i> Secured Income</i> type, or that BKC
would exercise its contractual powers reasonably or in good faith and for a
proper purpose.
<P>

(ii)	BKC breached those implied terms by reason of its conduct from 1995
onwards, and in particular: the withholding of financial
approval, the denial
of operational approval, a direction not to submit any further franchise
applications, the freeze on the recruitment
of third party franchisees, and the
notices purporting to terminate the Development Agreement.
<P>

(d)	<u>Other contractual issues</u>:
<P>

(i)	Whether, in respect of the Shorter Notice, BKC was not entitled to
terminate for breach of clause 2.1 where that breach was
caused by BKC's own
wrongful conduct.
<P>

(ii)	Whether, in respect of the Longer Notice, BKC was not entitled to
terminate for any of the breaches on the grounds that such
breaches were `de
minimus'.
<P>

(iii)	Whether BKC was entitled to require performance by HJPL, of the matters
on which it relied in the September 1997 Notice, in
circumstances where BKC had
repudiated the Development Agreement from November 1996 onwards.
<P>

(e)	<u>Montgomery</u> - whether, in respect of conduct by Montgomery:
<P>

(i)	BKC was knowingly involved in a breach of duty owed by Montgomery to
HJPL.

Termination, withholding financial approval or denying
operational approval to
HJPL.
<P>

(iii)	Compensation and loss arising from BKC's conduct referred to in (ii)
ought to be determined applying equitable principles.
<P>

(iv)	Certain waivers and acknowledgments obtained by BKC under extension
agreements relating to the successor restaurants should
be set aside, by reason
of BKC's knowing involvement in Montgomery's breach of duty relating to
successor restaurants, or for mistake,
or under s.51AA and s.51AC of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade
Practices Act 1974</a> (Cth).
<P>

<i>Shell</i>
<P>

(f)	<u>Shell</u> - whether, in relation to the development of co-branded
restaurants with Shell:
<P>

(i)	BKC owed fiduciary duties to HJPL that prevented BKC from taking steps
either itself or in conjunction with Shell to exclude
HJPL from the
development, operation and/or servicing of those restaurants;
<P>

(ii)	BKC breached those duties; and/or
<P>

(iii)	BKC engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct towards HJPL.
<P>

	........
<P>

(h)	<u>Increased Royalties</u> - whether BKC is entitled to an order that HJPL
pay an increased rate of royalties.
<P>

<P>

(i)	BKC must offer HJPL new franchise agreements for each of the Successor
restaurants, for a 20 year, or alternatively a 15 year,
term.
<P>

(ii)	Alternatively, the waivers and releases by HJPL in BKC's Extension
Agreements ought to be set aside by reason of the involvement
of Montgomery;
breach of BKC's contractual duty of good faith; mistake and/or unconscionable
conduct under s.51AA of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>.
<P>

(iii)	Alternatively, HJPL is entitled to renewal of the franchise agreements
because it complied, at least in all material respects,
with BKC's requirements
or would have done so but for BKC's refusal to cooperate.
<P>

(iv)	Alternatively, BKC is estopped from failing to offer HJPL new franchise
agreements for Beak House, Bunbury and Bull Creek.
<P>

(v)	Alternatively, certain contractual provisions in the franchise agreements
relating to the successor stores are unreasonable
restraints of trade.
<P>

(vi)	Alternatively, BKC has engaged in unconscionable conduct with respect to
the Successor Stores.
<P>

<i>Damages</i>
<P>

(n)	<u>Heads of Damage</u> - whether HJPL is entitled to damages or equitable
compensation, and if so in what amount, for:

Agreement; and
<P>

(v)	alternatively in relation to successor stores, loss of profits for the
continued operation of those stores for a 15 or 20 year
term.
<P>

(vi)	exemplary damages.
<P>

<i>Outstanding Issues</i>
<P>

(o)	Matters which are not the subject of the present submissions by either HJPL
or BKC:
<P>

(i)	costs
<P>

(ii)	separate issues arising in the Ivancic proceedings."
<P>

"Successor Restaurants" are ones in respect of which the original franchise
agreements have expired and HJPL claims an entitlement
to further franchise
agreements pursuant to options to renew.
<P>

The Relief Sought By HJPL
<P>

30   	By its Seventh Further Amended Summons, ("the Summons"),
HJPL sought declarations that in the events which have happened and
on the
proper construction of the Development Agreement:-
<P>

(a)	the Shorter Notice served by BKC on 18 November 1996 is void and of no
effect;
<P>

(b)	the Longer Notice served by BKC on 18 November 1996 is void and of no
effect; and
<P>

(c)	the Notice of Termination served by BKC on 12 September 1997 is void and of
no effect.
<P>

31   	HJPL sought injunctive relief restraining BKC from acting
on the basis that any of those notices was effective to terminate
the
Development Agreement.
<P>

32   	It sought relief related to the Notices served by BKC and
their validity, and pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.87</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>.  It also
sought damages, equitable compensation and ancillary relief.
<P>

33   	Under the heading "Nature of Dispute", HJPL raised whether
the two notices purporting to terminate the Development Agreement
and the
notices given pursuant to the Service Agreement were effective, and whether BKC
is otherwise entitled to terminate the Development
Agreement.  The dispute was
stated as being whether BKC could rely on the breaches on the basis that:-
<P>

(a)	they did not arise;
<P>

(b)	they were caused by BKC's prior breach of the Development Agreement;
<P>

(c)	BKC is estopped from relying upon them;
<P>

(d)	they have been cured or are immaterial or stale; and 
<P>

(e)	BKC's reliance upon them involves a breach of good faith on its part.
<P>

34   	Similar issues are raised in relation to the notice dated
12 September 1997.
<P>

35   	It was also stated that the dispute concerned whether
Notices of Default dated 1 October 1997 issued by BKC in relation to
the Hexham
and Maitland Franchise Agreements were effective, and whether BKC was otherwise
entitled to terminate them by reason of
those notices.
<P>

36   	A number of matters of dispute were raised in relation to
negotiations between BKC and Shell, and the dispute was also stated
as
concerning whether:-
<P>

(a)	BKC was knowingly involved in a breach by Mr Montgomery of a fiduciary duty
owed to HJPL;
<P>

(b)	HJPL is entitled to relief against forfeiture of its rights under the
Development and Service Agreements;
<P>

(c)	BKC failed to comply with clauses 7.1 and 7.3 of the Development Agreement
in relation to Burger King Restaurants situated at
the locations referred to in
Schedule B;
<P>

(d)	BKC is obliged to execute and/or is estopped from declining to execute
further Franchise Agreements for twenty year, or alternatively
fifteen year,
terms (or such lesser terms as HJPL may agree) in relation to a number of
specified Burger King Restaurants by failing
to offer HJPL a Franchise
Agreement for such periods at the expiry of the additional terms of those
Agreements; and
<P>

(e)	certain clauses contained in the Franchise Agreements between BKC and HJPL
specified in Schedule C constitute an unreasonable
restraint of trade and are
void and of no effect, and whether BKC's seeking to enforce those clauses would
contravene ss.51AA and/or
51AC of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>.
<P>

The Agreements
<P>

37   	Because of the significance of the terms of the
agreements, it is desirable to deal with them in some detail.
<P>

(a)	The Settlement Agreement
<P>

38   	The Settlement Agreement was entered into between BKC,
Selden and HJPL.  It recited:-
<P>

"A.	BKC and its predecessor, The Pillsbury Company, have developed a system,
known as the Burger King system, for operating limited
menu restaurants known
as Burger King restaurants.
<P>

  B.	BKC has granted Selden the right to operate Burger King restaurants under
individual franchise agreements at certain locations
in Australia and Hungry
Jack's is the assignee from Selden of those franchise agreements.
<P>

  C.	A number of differences have arisen between the parties which they have
agreed to resolve, and the parties have agreed to continue
their relationship,
on the terms and conditions of this agreement."
<P>

39   	There are a number of definitions, one of which is
"Matters in Dispute", which are defined as "the differences that have arisen
between the parties, brief descriptions of which are set out in Schedule 3".
It is desirable to refer to certain other definitions
to understand the Matters
in Dispute.
<P>

40   	"Expired Restaurants" are defined as "the Burger King
Restaurants operating at the locations set out in Schedule 1"; "Unapproved
Restaurant" is defined as meaning "a Burger King Restaurant operating at a
location set out in Schedule 4"; and "Unapproved Site"
is defined as "a site
set out in Schedule 5 at which Selden proposes to construct a Burger King
Restaurant".
<P>

41   	Schedule 3 stated the Matters in Dispute thus:-
<P>

"1.	Hungry Jack's continued operation of the Expired Restaurants after expiry
of the franchise agreements for those restaurants.
<P>

  2.	Hungy Jack's opening of the Unapproved Restaurants without BKC consent.
<P>

  3.	Hungry Jack's commencement of construction of Burger King Restaurants at
the Unapproved Sites without BKC approval.
<P>

  4.	BKC's failure to approve the Unapproved Restaurants and the Unapproved
Sites.
<P>

  5.	The validity of the 1989 Development and Service Agreements."
<P>

42   	By clause 2 the parties terminated certain agreements and
acknowledged that all Franchise Agreements executed prior to 13
November 1990
were valid and binding notwithstanding the provisions of the Settlement
Agreement or the termination of the 1986 Development
Agreement.
<P>

43   	By clause 3 BKC approved each Unapproved Restaurant and
the construction of a Burger King Restaurant at each Unapproved Site;
and "must
approve all other applications for approval of a proposed Burger King
Restaurant that Selden has lodged with BKC as at
the date of this
Agreement".
<P>

44   	Clause 4 required HJPL, upon execution of the Settlement
Agreement, to execute and deliver to BKC a Franchise Agreement for
each Expired
Restaurant in a certain form, and Franchise Agreements for each Unapproved
Restaurant and Unapproved Site and for the
Burger King Restaurant operating at
Browns Plains, Brisbane.
<P>

45   	Clause 5 required the entry into the Development and
Service Agreements and "an executed Trademark Agreement": the Registered
User
Agreement.
<P>

46   	Clauses 6 and 7 recorded respectively the parties'
acknowledgment that the 1989 Development and Service Agreements were not
binding, and their release of each other from all claims and actions relating
to or arising out of the Matters in Dispute.
<P>

(b)	The Development Agreement
<P>

47   	The parties to the Development Agreement were BKC and
HJPL.  The recitals recorded BKC's skill and experience in the development
and
operation of the Burger King System, and that in Australia such restaurants
were known as Hungry Jack's Restaurants; that HJPL
recognised the benefits to
be derived from being identified with and franchised by BKC to operate in
Australia limited menu restaurants
utilising the Burger King System  and the
name and trademark Burger King and such other trademarks as may be authorised
by BKC from
time to time for use in connection with Burger King Restaurants;
that Selden had entered into various agreements with The Pillsbury
Company on 1
June 1973 and had since "opened numerous restaurants in Australia under the
name Hungry Jack's, each having been separately
licensed to Selden under an
individual Franchise Agreement and assigned to Hungry Jack's with the consent
of BKC"; the assignment
by The Pillsbury Company, with the knowledge and
consent of Selden, to BKC of various rights; the entry into an agreement on 1
June
1986 whereby BKC and Selden agreed upon a basis for the continued
development of Burger King Restaurants in Australia and the termination
of that
agreement on 30 November 1990; and that:-
<P>

"Various difficulties having arisen between BKC and Hungry Jack's and having
been resolved by agreement between them, BKC and Hungry
Jack's now wish to make
further provision for the development of Burger King Restaurants in Australia,
to replace the provisions
of the agreement of 1 June 1986."
<P>

48   	Clause 1 dealt with the grant, clause 1.1 stating:-
<P>

"Hungry Jack's is hereby granted a non-exclusive right to develop and, subject
to the full satisfaction of the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, to be
franchised to operate Burger King Restaurants in Australia.  Specifically
excluded from this non-exclusive
grant are institutional locations such as but
not limited to public buildings, schools, hospitals, airports, factories and
military
establishments.  Hungry Jack's has no rights for development in New
Zealand."
<P>

49   	Clause 2.1, under the heading "Development Schedule",
provided that HJPL, or any BKC franchisee introduced by it to BKC, shall
develop and open for business in Australia in accordance with the franchise and
site approval procedures described in the Development
Agreement:-
<P>

".. a minimum of four (4) new Burger King Restaurants per annum commencing on
12 November 1990 in the area comprising Western Australia,
South Australia and
Queensland (`the Development Schedule')."
<P>

50   	Clause 2.2 made provision for delay arising out of matters
beyond the reasonable control of HJPL.
<P>

51   	Clause 3.1 provided that the term of the agreement was
five years commencing on 13 November 1990, and clause 3.2 stated:-
<P>

"Upon expiration of that term, provided that Hungry Jack's shall have opened
twenty (20) Burger King Restaurants during the previous
five (5) years (with a
minimum of two (2) restaurants per annum), in the area comprising Western
Australia, South Australia and Queensland
in accordance with the franchise and
site approval procedures described in this Agreement, Hungry Jack's shall have
the right to
renew this Agreement upon the same terms for a further period of
five (5) years, at the expiration of which, subject to the same
proviso, Hungry
Jack's shall have the right to renew this Agreement upon the same terms for a
further period of five (5) years, at
the expiration of which, subject to the
same proviso, Hungry Jack's shall have the right to renew this Agreement upon
the same terms
for a further period of five (5) years."
<P>

52   	It will be apparent that there is a potential tension
between clauses 2.1 and 3.2.  Clause 2.1 required the development and
opening
of a minimum of four new restaurants each year in Western Australia, South
Australia and Queensland.  Clause 3.2, upon which
the right of renewal was
dependent, required the opening of twenty restaurants during the previous five
years, with a minimum of
two each year, in the same States.  Therefore,
arguably, to satisfy clause 2.1 HJPL had to develop and open a minium of four
new
restaurants each year, but to satisfy clause 3.2, whilst it was necessary
for it to open twenty new restaurants in the five year
period, it was
sufficient if a minimum of two restaurants was opened each year.
<P>

53   	Clause 4 is headed "Development Procedure".  Clause 4.1
stated:-
<P>

"4.1	This Agreement does not constitute a franchise for the operation of a
Burger King Restaurant but is intended by the parties
to set forth the terms
and conditions which, if fully satisfied, would entitle Hungry Jack's to
individual franchises for each restaurant
to be developed under this Agreement.
Hungry Jack's must apply for and obtain franchise and site approval from BKC
for each restaurant
to be established pursuant to this agreement through BKC's
standard franchise and site approval procedures, including, without limitation,
submitting the then current Multiple Franchise Application, Management
Committee Form, Capitalisation Plan and Preliminary Agreement.
 As a condition
to the granting of a Franchise Approval, Hungry Jack's must have, in the sole
discretion of BKC, operational, financial
and legal approval at the time of
application for a franchise.  In this Agreement the terms operational,
financial and legal mean:
<P>

  (a)	Operational 
<P>

	Hungry Jack's conducts each of its Burger King Restaurants in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the applicable
Franchise
Agreements, and the standards, specifications and procedures specified in the
volumes comprising the Manual of Operating
Data, as amended, including the
maintenance of interior and exterior of the restaurants to reflect an
acceptable Burger King image.
 Hungry Jack's understands that changes in said
standards, specifications and procedures may become necessary from time to
time.
 Hungry Jack's agrees to accept, as reasonable, said changes and Hungry
Jack's further agrees that it is within the sole discretion
of BKC to make such
changes.
<P>

  	(b)	Financial
<P>

	Hungry Jack's has performed and is faithfully performing all terms and
conditions under each individual Franchise Agreement issued,
and is not in
default of any money obligations owed by Hungry Jack's to BKC.  Hungry Jack's
acknowledges and agrees that it is vital
to BKC's interests that a franchisee
be financially sound to avoid a business failure affecting the reputation and
good name of the
Burger King marks.
<P>

(c)	Legal
<P>

	Hungry Jack's has promptly submitted to BKC all information and documents
reasonably requested by BKC prior to and as a basis for
the issuance and
consummation of individual franchises, has taken additional action requested
from time to time and is in compliance
with all obligations under all
agreements with BKC.
<P>

  4.2	Failure to meet operational, financial or legal standards shall
constitute grounds for refusing to grant or withdrawing a
franchise approval
and shall not extend, modify or reduce the development requirements of clause
2."
<P>

Operational, Financial And Legal Approval
<P>

54   	A failure to have operational, financial and legal
approval does not constitute a breach of clause 4.1, as such approvals
are
conditions to the obtaining of franchise and site approval from BKC without
which HJPL could not develop through individual franchises.
 However, each of
the approvals depends on HJPL's complying with various of its contractual
obligations to BKC, so that there can
only be disapproval if HJPL is in breach
of such obligations.  Further, if HJPL is legally precluded from developing, as
required
by clauses 2.1 and 3.2, it may be in breach of the first and not able
to exercise its rights under the second.  This point is emphasised
by clause
4.2.
<P>

55   	Much of the evidence was concerned with whether HJPL had
met the operational and financial criteria.  There was no real suggestion
that
it had not met the requirements for legal approval, save, perhaps, in so far as
that included compliance with all the contractual
obligations, which alleged
non-compliance was gathered up under the allegation that there was a failure to
have operational approval.
 In relation to the meeting of financial criteria it
was not in issue that HJPL had duly paid all money to which BKC became entitled
by way of royalties or otherwise.  The financial issues raised by BKC centred
around HJPL's financial viability and stability, which,
notwithstanding its
meeting its payment obligations, were thought by BKC, at least in the second
half of 1995, to be relevant.  This,
in turn, was said by BKC to require some
consideration of the Group's overall financial position, which involved an
examination of
certain of the holding companies and the way in which the Group
was financed.
<P>

56   	In relation to operational matters a major area of dispute
was the way in which restaurants were operated and maintained and,
hence,
rated.  As I have noted BKC appointed persons to inspect the restaurants to
ensure that, in the opinion of the inspectors,
they were being run conformably
with BKC's specifications.  After inspections restaurants were rated as
"Superior", "Satisfactory"
or "Needs Improvement".  Matters, which could lead
to a "Needs Improvement" rating, covered all the requirements of BKC, but there
was an obligation, if a restaurant was rated as "Needs Improvement", for the
particular problems leading to that rating, to be overcome
so that the
restaurant reached an acceptable rating.  These inspections covered matters
such as cleanliness, food quality, health
requirements, efficiency of service,
presentation of the restaurants, staff cleanliness and efficiency, and the
existence of defective
and mal-functioning equipment. It is necessary, in
considering the case, to have regard to the number of restaurants which fell
within
the "Needs Improvement" category.
<P>

57   	The reason for this is that in 1994 BKC introduced a
worldwide policy known as the "Expansion Policy", which was to be applied
in
Australia from about October 1994.  It provided for operational disapproval if,
relevantly for present purposes, more than ten
per cent of restaurants were in
the "Needs Improvement" category.  Mr Oslington submitted that BKC did not have
to apply the policy
in Australia if it did not wish, but that it could have
relied upon the more stringent obligations in the Development Agreement,
which
it decided not to do.  The more stringent requirements were stated as being any
failure by HJPL in relation to any one restaurant
to conduct it in accordance
with each and every BKC requirement.  Thus, Mr Oslington's submission ran, even
the most apparently minor
breach by HJPL in one restaurant would be sufficient
to allow BKC to refuse operational approval in its "sole discretion", with the
result that until operational approval was restored by the breach's being
remedied, development approval would be denied.  This type
of submission, in
part, gave rise to submissions about the implication of terms based on
reasonableness and good faith.
<P>

58   	The restaurants were re-rated by BKC, consistently with
the policy of doing so every six months, in February 1995, and, notwithstanding
that it was BKC's contention that more than ten per cent were in the "Needs
Improvement" category, it decided that it would be unfair
to impose the
Expansion Policy because HJPL had only been told of it in October 1994.  The
matter was raised by Mr Horowitz, who
was by then BKC's Franchise Manager in
Australia and charged with implementing the Expansion Policy, with Mr Green,
HJPL's Operations
Manager, who told Mr Horowitz that he thought he could bring
the "Needs Improvement" restaurants out of that category within eight
weeks.
Mr Horowitz said he thought that was too ambitious having regard to the state
of the restaurants, and suggested that twenty
per cent of the "Needs
Improvement" restaurants be upgraded out of that category every two months, and
that if that were done there
would be fewer than ten per cent in the "Needs
Improvement" category, when the restaurants were rated in November 1995.
<P>

59   	By November 1995 HJPL had, according to BKC, "failed
dismally" to brings its "Needs Improvement" restaurants into proper operational
condition.  Some of the restaurants had been upgraded, but others had become
"Needs Improvement".  It will be necessary to deal with
this matter in far more
detail.  Suffice to say, at the moment, that I am not satisfied that BKC was
entitled to operationally disapprove
HJPL in November 1995.
<P>

The Letters Concerning  The Withholding Of Financial Approval
<P>

60   	On 12 September 1995, Mr Miolla wrote to Mr Cowin stating
that he understood from the Finance Department that the Parramatta
site package
"and any other expansion requests you have pending" were delayed due to the
delay in the delivery of HJPL's year end
financial statements.  The letter
continued, as Mr Miolla conceded contrary to the terms of the Development
Agreement:-
<P>

"As you know, the terms of the Development Agreement prohibit HJPL from
expanding unless it submits annual, audited financial statements
which show
that it is in compliance with our financial requirements for expansion."
<P>

61   	The letter continued that as Cititogo Pty Limited was not
"adequately capitalised, it must also look to the HJPL balance sheet
to meet
these expansion criteria".  Mr Miolla said this was the reason for the delay,
and:-
<P>

"As you know, we are also awaiting this information as the first step in our
joint venture discussions.  We will obviously not be
meeting this week as we
had originally hoped, but I understand that you are planning to attend the
convention in Orlando next month
and that would be a perfect opportunity for us
to get together.  ..."
<P>

62   	On 20 September 1995, Mr Miolla wrote to Mr Cowin in
response to some recent letters from him and, relevantly for present
purposes,
thanked him for the recent pro forma budget and financial statements of HJPL.
The letter continued:-
<P>

"Those will be useful in connection with the joint venture discussion, although
the fiscal 1995 financial statements are the real
hard data we need to move
forward.  This is true with reference to both the joint venture and the pending
applications for expansion.
 As I stated in my earlier letter, we cannot
approve any expansion until we have completed a financial review of the actual
audited
financial statements and you are not authorised under the terms of the
Development Agreement to commence construction at any of the
proposed sites
until we communicate such approval in writing.  As we discussed, the
Development Agreement <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s4.1.html" class="autolink_findacts">(Section 4.1)</a> requires you to follow our standard
requirements, which are that such approval will come in the form of the
standard Target Reservation
Agreement being signed by all Australian and other
BKC franchisees.  If you acquire any real property interests in the interim,
you
do so at your own risk."
<P>

63   	On 11 October 1995, Mr Cowin sent a facsimile transmission
to Mr Miolla stating, inter alia:-
<P>

"I have attached the financial numbers which you requested and are presented in
the same manner as provided last December.  You
will note that both the FCC and
D/E ratios requirements are met by the HJPL entity.  Please confirm that you
are now satisfied with
regard to your financial requests re approval process
and we don't require the approval on a conditional exception basis."
<P>

After dealing with certain other financial matters, Mr Cowin ended:-
<P>

"I look forward to trying to reach some form of resolution as to how we can
work out an ongoing development system that enables
us to progress matters in a
commercial manner."
<P>

64   	On 18 October 1995, Mr Miolla replied.  He said he had met
with Mr Gooden and Mrs Driscoll to "go over" the supplementary
information sent
on 11 October 1995, and that BKC continued to have "a hard time understanding
the financial information due to the
limited nature of the balance sheet and
the absence of a profit and loss statement".
<P>

65   	He continued that whilst the discussion "was generally
encouraging" there were three major areas of concern to which he referred
in
some detail, and that he believed he could have the Finance Department approve
the sites at Myaree, Hurstville and Bolivar "on
an exception basis shortly
after receiving the consolidated, detailed P&amp;L statement discussed in
paragraph 1 above", and:-
<P>

"If you can have John Butler fax a copy directly to me I will attempt to obtain
the final Finance Department approval within 48
hours and then send you the
Target Reservation Agreements for the three sites.  You will be authorised to
proceed after you sign
and return the Target Reservation Agreements and the
standard US Dollar 5,000/site deposit will be due at that time.
<P>

We will not be able to grant any further expansion approvals unless we can get
the information necessary to deal with the issues
set forth in paragraphs 2 and
3 above."
<P>

It was not in issue that no general financial approval was granted thereafter.

<P>

The Letter of 27 November 1995 Concerning Operational Disapproval
<P>

66   	On 27 November 1995, Mr Roy Blauer, a Vice-President of
BKC in charge of operational issues in Australia, wrote to Mr Cowin.
 By then
the time to renew the Development Agreement had passed.  It had not been
renewed and BKC took no point about this.  The
parties carried on as if that
Agreement remained on foot.  The letter referred to the Development Agreement,
and to BKC's worldwide
Expansion Policy.  In relation to that policy it stated
that the "Operational Expansion Criteria" had been delivered to HJPL at the
commencement of 1995.  After quoting clause 4.1(a), the letter stated that
pursuant to its terms BKC had the authority to refuse
to approve any expansion
by HJPL, if HJPL failed to comply with the terms "of a single Franchise
Agreement".  It continued:-
<P>

"Notwithstanding this requirement, BKC has, without waiving its right to impose
this standard in the future, agreed at this time
to treat HJPL consistent with
the less restrictive provisions of the Expansion Policy."
<P>

The letter referred to that policy and to the discussions between Mr Horowitz
and Mr Green, including Mr Green's original request
for less than a month to
complete the Franchise Action Plan, "but at the urging of Terry Horowitz the
Plan was increased to a total
of more than eight months, ending on November 15,
1995".  In fact no Franchise Action Plan had been provided to HJPL.
<P>

67   	The letter continued:-
<P>

"When the Franchise Action Plan was initiated, there were approximately 36 HJPL
restaurants in the Needs Improvement category. 
At the end of the Franchise
Action Plan, there were still a total of 31 restaurants in the Needs
Improvement category.  A summary
of the major issues at those 31 restaurants is
enclosed.
<P>

Pursuant to the Expansion Policy, a franchisee may not expand if it has more
than 10% of its restaurants in the Needs Improvement
category.  HJPL has more
than 20% of its restaurants in the Needs Improvement category and is,
therefore, in violation of both the
Expansion Policy and the more restrictive
provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s4.1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4.1(a)</a> of the Development Agreement.  Unfortunately, this
means that at this time HJPL is not approved for any further expansion.
<P>

Specifically, BKC will not grant any additional `Franchise' or `Site' approvals
as defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 4</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">5</a> of the Development Agreement, and you are in
default under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s15.1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 15.1(b)</a> of the Development Agreement.
<P>

Although <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s15.2.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 15.2</a> of the Development Agreement gives you only 30 days to
cure this breach, BKC is willing to meet with you and discuss a mutually agreed
plan to remedy this situation over a longer period of time if you are also
interested in such a solution.  Malcolm and Terry have
already begun
discussions on this subject.  Any failure by BKC to act after this 30 days does
not, however, constitute a waiver of
any default or HJPL obligation under the
Development or Franchise Agreements."
<P>

The letter concluded:-
<P>

"Jack, I believe that BKC has acted in good faith and substantially relaxed the
requirements of the Development Agreement in order
to work with HJPL in order
to improve operations.  There is, however, no question that there is an issue
which needs to be resolved
and I hope that the two companies can work together
in the near future to reposition HJPL so that it can continue to expand within
the Burger King system."
<P>

68   	There are a number of points to be made about this letter.
Firstly, as I have noted, BKC had not furnished a Franchise Action
Plan, which
was a standard form document of BKC, to HJPL.  Secondly, the letter stated that
a mutually acceptable solution may be
found, and adopted the attitude that HJPL
may continue to expand, which is inconsistent with a view that the arrangements
between
the parties were at a stage where they might require consideration to
be given to termination.  Thirdly, Mr Blauer appears to have
exercised BKC's
"sole discretion" on the basis that HJPL had 31 restaurants, which represented
more than 20 per cent in the Needs
Improvement category, and by virtue of that
operational approval was denied.  There was a substantial issue of fact, to
which I shall
have to refer in more detail, whether 31 restaurants were in that
category.  At the moment it is sufficient to note that Mr Blauer
was not
called, Mr Oslington stating that although a witness statement of his had been
served and he was available, a deliberate
decision had been taken not to do so.
The significance of this, in the submission of Mr Bathurst, was that there was
no evidence
from Mr Blauer as to how he would have exercised his discretion if,
for example, less than 31 restaurants were in that category.
 He submitted that
one could not infer that Mr Blauer would, in those circumstances and having
regard to the long relationship between
BKC and HJPL, have exercised his
discretion adversely to HJPL.  He also pointed to the more conciliatory
passages in the letter as
tending to negate such a result.   He further
questioned the significance, so far as Mr Blauer was concerned, of 31 or 20 per
cent
of the restaurants being, according to Mr Blauer, in the Needs Improvement
category, and submitted that by not calling him, BKC had
failed to provide any
adequate reason for refusing operational approval.
<P>

69   	Mr Oslington relied on certain admissions by Mr Green that
HJPL had more than 10 per cent of restaurants in the Needs Improvement
category, and that it had otherwise failed to meet the agreement reached with
Mr Horowitz.  These admissions no doubt provided evidence
of those facts.  But
HJPL's submission was that the refusal of operational approval, particularly in
the circumstances of this case,
was not based on an objectively ascertainable
contractual requirement, which could be proved by an admission.  It was
dependent on
the exercise of "sole discretion" and unless the person, who
exercised the discretion, was called to prove that even if the factual
position
posited for its exercise was not proved none-the-less some lesser element of
breach would have led to the discretion being
so exercised, there was no
evidence of the basis on which the discretion was exercised and  BKC had simply
failed to prove that the
operational disapproval arose from the exercise of the
discretion, including its exercise reasonably and in good faith.
<P>

70   	The letter of 27 November 1995 made clear that BKC still
regarded the Development Agreement on foot, notwithstanding that
it had expired
and HJPL had not sought to renew it.  As I have said, that agreement continued
to be the basis on which the parties
conducted their affairs.
<P>

A Return To The Development Agreement
<P>

71   	Clauses 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 of the Development Agreement
provided:-
<P>

"7.1	Hungry Jack's may introduce third parties to BKC and BKC shall approve
such third parties as its own franchisees, subject to
the same approval
procedures as apply  to Hungry Jack's, including operational, financial and
legal approvals.  BKC may decline to
approve a third party franchisee at a
particular location if a Burger King Restaurant at that location would be
likely substantially
adversely to affect sales at another existing location or
at a location for which an application for approval has been formally lodged
with BKC.  In the event of disagreement the question of likely substantial
adverse effect shall be referred to a neutral third party
agreed by the parties
or nominated by the President for the time being of the Law Society of New
South Wales.  The neutral third
party shall consider submissions put by the
parties and his or her opinion shall be binding.
<P>

  7.2	All third party franchised Burger King restaurants introduced by Hungry
Jack's to BKC shall be conducted under the same name
as is used from time to
time by Hungry Jack's.
<P>

7.3	Burger King may operate its own restaurants anywhere in Australia and may
franchise third parties anywhere in Australia save
that in the States of
Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland if Hungry Jack's is in
compliance with the Development Schedule,
the prior approval of Hungry Jack's
for the operation of any such restaurant must be obtained.  Such approval may
be withheld only
if a Burger King restaurant at that location would be likely
substantially adversely to affect sales at another existing location
or at a
location for which an application for approval has been formally lodged with
BKC."
<P>

Clause 7.3 emphasised the significance of compliance with the Development
Schedule. Operational, financial and legal approval was,
accordingly, necessary
both for HJPL and any third party franchisees it introduced before a restaurant
could be opened.  It is to
be noted that clause 4.1 placed emphasis on "each
restaurant" to be established, thus requiring, on Mr Bathurst's submission,
individual
consideration to be given to each application and not permitting a
general disapproval to be utilised.  In so far as third party
franchisees were
concerned, it was such franchisees that were required to meet the operational,
financial and legal approvals, the
obligation being on BKC to grant such
franchises if those criteria were met.
<P>

72   	Clause 15.1 of the Development Agreement provided that the
occurrence of any of the events specified therein shall constitute
good cause
for BKC, at its option and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies
provided for under the Development Agreement
or by law or equity, to terminate
it.  Clause 15.1(b) provided, as such a ground, that:-
<P>

"Hungry Jack's fails at any time to meet and satisfy fully the operational,
financial and legal requirements set forth in Clause
4, whether for the purpose
of seeking franchise approval or in the day-to-day operation of a Burger King
Restaurant."
<P>

73   	Clause 15.2, the proper construction and operation of
which is of critical significance in resolving portion of this case,
provided:-
<P>

"In the case of any breach which is capable of being cured, BKC shall not
terminate this Agreement unless and until Hungry Jack's
shall have failed to
cure such breach within ten (10) days in the case of the default of any
obligation to pay money to BKC and within
thirty (30) days in the case of any
other breach after being notified by BKC of the nature of the default."
<P>

74   	Another question is what other consequences flow from the
withdrawal of operational, financial and legal approval, save the
inability to
develop further until such approval was restored.  Whilst BKC considered that
the termination provisions of clause 15
became applicable in the case of all
breaches, it is necessary to have regard also to clause 8, which is headed
"Franchise Fees".
 Clause 8.1 provided:-
<P>

"Franchise fees payable by Hungry Jack's in respect of restaurants operated by
it shall be waived in any year commencing on 12 November
so long as Hungry
Jack's adheres to the Development schedule in that year.  Any failure to adhere
to the Development Schedule shall
attract a liability to pay a franchise fee in
respect of each restaurant required to be but not opened under the Development
Schedule.
<u> Such franchise fee shall be paid at the end of the year following
the failure, but not if such failure is made good by that time</u>."  (My
emphasis.)
<P>

The obligation to pay franchise fees only applied if there was a failure to
adhere to the Development Schedule.  This indicated,
quite clearly, that if
development was delayed HJPL was not excused from paying the franchise fee,
although it was once again excused
if the failure was made good by the end of
the year following the failure. Therefore, if there was not adherence to the
Development
Schedule, HJPL was subjected to a contractual obligation to pay
fees for which it would not otherwise have been liable.  That fee
may be
payable because HJPL did not comply with the Development Schedule, or because
it was precluded by BKC from doing so in BKC's
"sole discretion" on the basis
that BKC considered that it was in breach of the requirements for any of
operational, financial or
legal approvals.  In either case, provided that BKC
exercised its discretion correctly, HJPL was in breach, the correct exercise
of
the discretion depending on that.
<P>

75   	Clause 8.1 also gives rise to a substantial question of
construction.  The Shorter Notice purported to rely on the failure
to adhere to
the requirements of the Development Schedule.  The question which arose is
whether, if there was such a failure, clause
8, in conjunction with other
provisions of the Development Agreement, provided a regime for termination
different from that imposed
by clause 15.
<P>

76   	Clause 16 provided that upon termination:-
<P>

".. HUNGRY JACK'S shall have no further rights under this Agreement, but this
shall not affect then existing Franchise Agreements."
<P>

77   	Clause 18.2 provided:- 
<P>

"This Agreement is not transferable in whole or in part, whether to other
individuals, to corporations or other business organisations
to which such
might have been assigned, sold, transferred or conveyed, whether directly or by
operation of law.  If despite the prohibitions
of this Article, there is an
assignment, this Agreement shall automatically terminate.  HUNGRY JACK'S shall
have no right to sub-license
others to operate Burger King Restaurants."
<P>

78   	Clause 19.1 provided:-
<P>

"If any of the provisions of this Agreement may be construed in different ways,
one of which would render the provision unlawful,
void, voidable or
unenforceable, such provision shall have the meaning which renders it valid and
enforceable.  The language of all
provisions of the Agreement shall be
construed according to its fair meaning and not strictly against BKC or Hungry
Jack's.  ...."
<P>

79   	Clause 20.1 provided:-
<P>

"This Agreement embodies the entire Agreement and understanding between the
parties as to its subject matter and supersedes all
prior negotiations
understandings and agreements, written or oral.  The parties acknowledge that
they are not relying upon any representation,
warranty, condition, agreement or
understanding, written or oral except as herein specified.  Neither this
Agreement nor any term
or provision of it may not be changed, waived,
discharged, or modified orally.  The only changes, waivers, discharges or
modifications
that will be effective will be those which are in writing and
signed by the parties to this Agreement.  BKC shall not unreasonably
withhold
its consent to the sale or transfer of the whole of the issued shares of Hungry
Jack's Pty Limited."
<P>

Counsel agreed that the word "not" in the third sentence was a patent error,
and that the sentence should be read as if it were
not there.
<P>

80   	Clause 24 defined the relationship of the parties, and
provided that nothing in the Development Agreement should make them
partners or
joint venturers, or an agent or representative of the other in any dealings
with any third party.
<P>

81   	Clause 26.1 stated that as an inducement for BKC to enter
into the Development Agreement, HJPL acknowledged and agreed that
the Burger
King Restaurant Franchise System "is unique, especially in relation to building
design, food preparation format, service
format, menu, training programme,
store operations and related manuals, book-keeping and report formats,
marketing and advertising
formats and that BKC has valuable goodwill which it
develops and maintains pertaining to the foregoing".
<P>

82   	HJPL acknowledged that BKC would make its knowledge and
expertise in those areas available to it for use in assisting it with
successfully operating Burger King Restaurants from which HJPL expected to
profit significantly.  HJPL further acknowledged and agreed
that it would be
"an unfair method of competition to accept" those benefits from BKC and to
apply them in the operation of a non-Burger
King Restaurant "which is the same
as or similar to a Burger King Restaurant", and HJPL specifically acknowledged
that it would be
a violation of the Development Agreement, in essence, to
compete in the same type of restaurant.  The clause concluded with an
acknowledgment
that HJPL would, at all times during any term of the agreement,
"devote its best efforts towards the operation of its Burger King
Restaurants".
<P>

83   	Clause 28, which was headed "Survival", stated:- 
<P>

"The termination of the rights granted hereunder shall be without prejudice to
any rights which shall have accrued to either party
prior to the date of such
termination, shall not affect or diminish the binding force or effect of any
provision of this Agreement
which expressly or by implication shall come into
force or continue in force after termination, shall not release Hungry Jack's
from
obligations to pay any sums owed under this Agreement or to pay any
franchise fees, royalties or other sums owed to BKC under Franchise
Agreements
or other agreements, <u>and shall not terminate any Franchise Agreements
between BKC and Hungry Jack's for operating Burger King restaurants</u>."
(My emphasis.)
<P>

The Dispute Resolution Provision
<P>

84   	In each of the Development, Service and Franchise
Agreements there was a provision for dispute resolution. Each clause was
in the
same terms and it is convenient to set out clause 14 in the Development
Agreement as the example.  It provided:-
<P>

"14.1	A party must not start Court proceedings (except proceedings seeking
interlocutory relief) in respect of a dispute arising
out of this Agreement (a
`Dispute') unless it has complied with this clause. 
<P>

  14.2	A party claiming that a Dispute has arisen must notify the other party
to the Dispute.
<P>

  14.3	Within 10 days after a notice is given under clause 14.2 each party to
the Dispute must nominate in writing a representative
authorised to settle the
Dispute on its behalf.
<P>

  14.4	Each party must ensure that during the 45 day period after a notice is
given under clause 14.2 (or longer period agreed between
the parties), its
representative uses his or her best endeavours, with the other
representative:
<P>

(a)	to resolve the Dispute; or
<P>

	(b)	to agree on:
<P>

(i)	a process to resolve all or at least part of the Dispute without court
proceedings (eg, mediation, conciliation, executive appraisal
or independent
expert determination);
<P>

(ii)	the selection and payment of any third party to be engaged by the parties
on the involvement of any dispute resolution organisation;
<P>

(iii)	any procedural rules;
<P>

(iv)	the timetable, including any exchange of relevant information and
documents; and
<P>

(v)	the place where meetings will be held.
<P>

  14.5	The role of any third party will be to assist in negotiating a
resolution of the Dispute.  A third party may not make a decision
that is
binding on a party unless that party's representative has so agreed in
writing.
<P>

  14.6	Each party:
<P>

(a)	must keep confidential all information or documents disclosed by a
representative under this clause; and
<P>

(b)	not use such information or documents except to attempt to settle the
Dispute.
<P>

  14.7	Each party must bear its own costs of resolving a Dispute under this
clause and the parties must bear equally the costs of
any third party
engaged.
<P>

  14.8	After the 45 day period referred to in clause 14.4 (or longer period
agreed between the representatives), a party that has
complied with clauses
14.2 - 14.4 may terminate the dispute resolution process by giving notice to
the other party to the Dispute
<u>and may then act as it wishes, including
commencing proceedings in Court</u>."   (My emphasis.)
<P>

85   	One possible construction of this clause is that it is
only concerned with conditions precedent to the institution of proceedings
in
Court.  Certainly clause 14.1 imposes a prohibition on that occurring, save in
limited circumstances, until the requirements of
the clause have been met.
Another is that clause 14.2 imposes an additional obligation on the parties,
namely that whenever one claims
a dispute to have arisen, the other must be
notified and the various requirements of clause 14 must then be met.  My first
reading
was that this was probably not the case.  However, the concluding words
of clause 14.8 indicate that in addition to commencing Court
proceedings, which
must mean other than for an interlocutory injunciton, a party "may then act as
it wishes".  One way of so acting
would be by giving a Notice of Termination
provided the various requirements for doing so had been met.  Although I raised
the possibility
of this construction, I did not understand that any party
sought to adopt it.
<P>

86   	The Standard Franchise Agreement, which differed from the
Franchise Agreement annexed to the Development Agreement and which
applied to
certain of HJPL's restaurants, provided in Clause XII for termination in the
event of certain specified defaults, and
if the franchisee violated "any other
term or condition of this agreement and Franchisee fails to cure such violation
within thirty
(30) days after written notice from Company to cure same".
<P>

87   	Clause XIII provided for arbitration if BKC terminated
such a franchise agreement and HJPL disputed its right to do so or
the
reasonableness thereof: sub-clause A.  Sub-clause B provided for a wider right
for the parties to arbitrate "in the event of
any other dispute ... between the
parties ... in connection with the terms or provisions of this agreement
...".
<P>

(c)	The Service Agreement
<P>

88   	The Service Agreement was entered into between HJPL and
BKC.  It was subsequently amended on 12 December 1991 and on 26 February
1993.
It recited that BKC had developed and acquired specialised knowledge,
techniques, skills and expertise in the development and
operation of limited
menu restaurants known as Burger King Restaurants throughout the United States
and other countries, and that
in Australia such restaurants are known as Hungry
Jack's Restaurants; that Selden and its assignee HJPL had, since 1 June 1971,
opened
and operated Burger King Restaurants in Australia "each having been
separately licensed under an individual Franchise Agreement from
BKC or its
predecessor, The Pillsbury Company"; and that HJPL had also provided training
for its employees and managers in addition
to courses made available by BKC.
The recitals continued that HJPL desired to develop and maintain an educational
facility at an
approved location in Australia for the training and education of
its employees, managers and those of other franchisees of BKC to
be serviced by
HJPL; and that the parties desired that the training facilities be made
available.
<P>

89   	The Agreement made provision for the training of such
people and the recruitment by HJPL of suitable franchisees.  Article
XI stated
that BKC had advised HJPL of certain failures by it to comply with BKC's
operational procedures, that the parties should
prepare a separate letter
agreement detailing a plan and commitment for the correction of those failures,
and that HJPL would correct
them in accordance with that plan. Article XII
provided:-
<P>

"12.1	The agreement shall be terminable at any time by BKC upon giving 90 days
notice of a specified default, if such default is
not rectified within the
notice period.  The right of termination shall be exercisable only upon failure
by Hungry Jack's to provide
to any designated franchisee the services required
to be provided under any of the Franchise Agreements or under the Service
Agreement."
<P>

There was no attempt by BKC to terminate under that provision.  Notices of
Default and To Perform and a Letter of Instruction were
furnished by it to HJPL
under cover of a letter dated 18 November 1996.  The Letter of Instruction,
which was dated 18 November 1996,
required HJPL to upgrade the training
facilities and provide additional courses.  The Notice to Perform, which was
also dated 18
November 1996, required HJPL to perform and comply with its
obligations under various clauses of the Service Agreement, asserted
that HJPL
had failed to comply with a number of obligations set out in the Schedule to
the Notice, and stated that if HJPL failed
to perform its obligations as set
out in the Schedule within 90 days, time being of the essence, BKC would be
entitled to treat that
failure as a breach of any essential condition of the
Service Agreement entitling BKC to terminate it without further notice.
<P>

90   	The Service Agreement was amended by a further written
agreement on 12 December 1991 to give effect to the parties' agreement
that
HJPL should be a party to all franchise agreements entered into with
franchisees to which HJPL was to provide services. This
amendment became a
matter of significance in the light of the way in which the submissions
developed.  The Service Agreement was
further amended on 26 February 1993 to
give effect to the parties' agreement to vary its requirements relating to
HJPL's providing
marketing services to franchisees.
<P>

(d)	The Registered User Agreement
<P>

91   	The Registered User Agreement was entered into between BKC
and HJPL.  It recited that BKC was the registered proprietor in
Australia of
certain specified trademarks; that HJPL wished to use them in accordance with
s.74 of the Trademarks Act 1955; and that
BKC agreed to grant HJPL the right to
do so on the terms and conditions set forth.
<P>

92   	The Agreement provided for the use of the trademarks and
the right to terminate it, so far as either party was concerned,
by giving six
months' written notice and, in the case of BKC, if HJPL was in breach of
certain of its provisions. BKC has not purported
to give any such notice.
Clause 7.3 stated that immediately after termination HJPL must stop using the
trademarks and take all steps
to cancel its registration as a registered user
of them.
<P>

The Standard Franchise Agreement
<P>

93   	On 8 August 1979 The Pillsbury Company and Selden entered
into a Standard Franchise Agreement, which recited, inter alia,
that Selden
desired to be franchised to operate Burger King Restaurants in Australia and
New Zealand, and had had a full and adequate
opportunity to be advised
thoroughly of the terms and conditions of the Franchise Agreement by counsel of
its own choosing.  It provided
that The Pillsbury Company would make services
available to Selden, and that subject to the terms and conditions of the
Franchise
Agreement and the continuing good faith performance thereof by
Selden, The Pillsbury Company granted to it "the franchise to operate
a Burger
King Restaurant at the location of the premises (which is defined in Appendix A
attached hereto) and in consideration of
the payment by franchisee of the
royalties hereinafter specified".
<P>

94   	The term of the Agreement was from the date of the opening
for business of each restaurant until midnight on the day preceding
the
fifteenth anniversary thereof, unless sooner terminated in accordance with the
Agreement.
<P>

95   	The Agreement made provision for a number of detailed
matters and, in clause IX, stated that provided that Selden had substantially
complied with all its terms and conditions and those of any other agreements
between the companies, and with the operating standards
and criteria
established for the Burger King Restaurants, The Pillsbury Company would offer
it the opportunity to remain a franchisee
for one additional period of fifteen
years provided that:-
<P>

"A.	Franchisee shall agree to make such capital expenditures as may be
reasonably required to renovate and modernise the restaurant
building,
premises, signs and equipment so as to reflect the then current image of Burger
King Restaurants.
<P>

  B.	Franchisee must have the right to remain in possession of the premises, or
other premises acceptable to Company, for the new
term.  If Franchisee elects
(or is required) to relocate, then Franchisee shall pay Company's reasonable
expenses in relocating,
developing or evaluating the new premises.  Company
shall not be required to extend its credit or resources in obtaining financing
for premises or equipment.
<P>

  C.	Franchisee shall execute a new Franchise Agreement on the form then being
used by Company in the United States, which may differ
from this Franchise
Agreement as to royalty.  The rate of royalty shall be re-negotiated at that
time taking into account the Burger
King rate of royalty then prevailing in
other countries of the world.
<P>

  E.	Franchisee shall give Company written notice of its desire to exercise its
option to continue as a franchisee not less than
fifteen (15) months prior to
the expiration of the term of this Agreement."
<P>

There was argument as to what these provisions meant.  It was not in issue that
HJPL had not complied with sub-clause E, and that
BKC had taken no point about
that.  However, the meaning of sub-clause A was very much in issue,
particularly concerning when the
franchisee had to carry out the work agreed to
be done.  Mr Bathurst's submission was that there only had to be an agreement
to carry
out the described work, without its being specified at that stage, as
a condition for obtaining the renewal.  Mr Oslington's submission
was that
there had to be agreement on the precise work to be carried out before the
renewal was granted.
<P>

96   	Clause XII provided for termination on default, including
if Selden failed to maintain the standards set forth in the Agreement,
as
supplemented by the Manual, of cleanliness, health and sanitation.  The effect
of termination was agreed to be that Selden might
not use the trademarks, and
that it should not, thereafter, directly or indirectly, identify itself in any
manner as a franchisee
of The Pillsbury Company.
<P>

The International Burger King Restaurant Franchise Agreement
<P>

97   	The International Burger King Restaurant Franchise
Agreement was Annexure "A" to the Development Agreement.  It recited the
position of BKC and the recognition by HJPL of the benefits to be derived from
being identified with and licensed by BKC and being
able to utilise the Burger
King System and the Burger King Marks, which BKC made available to its
franchisees.  It also recited that
HJPL desired to be franchised to operate a
Burger King Restaurant.
<P>

98   	The term was twenty years from the date the Franchised
Restaurant first opened for business, unless sooner terminated in accordance
with the terms and provisions of the Agreement, and:-
<P>

"FRANCHISEE accepts this licence with the full and complete understanding that
the licence is for twenty (20) years with no promise
or assurance of renewal or
the granting of a new licence at expiration.  This constitutes the basic
underlying substance of this
licence.  Suggestions from franchisees for
improving products, equipment, uniforms, restaurant facilities, service format
and advertising
are encouraged and will be considered by BKC when adopting or
modifying standards, specifications and procedures for the Burger King
System."
<P>

99   	The Agreement  provided for a number of operational
matters and stated, in clause 3J:-
<P>

"The parties recognise that conditions in Australia may require departure from
the standards prescribed in A-I above.  Franchisee
shall be entitled to make
such departure with the consent of BKC, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld."
<P>

100   	Clauses 4 and 5 dealt with services available to the
franchisee and restaurant sites, and subsequent clauses dealt with training
and
royalties, including accounting procedures and a right to audit.
<P>

101   	Clause 15, which was headed "Default and Effective
Termination", provided:-
<P>

"If an act of default occurs and franchisee fails to cure the default within
the cure period specified, and if no time is specified
then within thirty (30)
days of default, BKC may, at its option and without prejudice to any other
rights or remedies provided for
hereunder or by law or equity, terminate the
franchise granted herein.  If any applicable law or rule requires a greater
prior notice
of termination, the prior notice required by such law or rule
shall be substituted for the notice requirements herein.  The following
shall
be an act of default:
<P>

(i)	Franchisee fails to maintain and operate the Franchise Restaurant in
accordance with the standards and specifications established
by BKC as to
service, cleanliness, health and sanitation; knowingly sells any product which
does not conform to BKC's specification;
fails to sell products designated by
BKC or sells products not approved by BKC.  Franchisee shall have five (5) days
after notification
to cure the default."
<P>

102   	There are a number of other provisions amounting to acts
of default and a non-waiver provision.  The effect of termination
is stated to
be that the franchisee's right to use Burger King Marks and the Burger King
System shall terminate, and the franchisee
shall not thereafter identify itself
as a Burger King franchisee, or publicly identify itself as a former Burger
King franchisee,
or use any of BKC's business methods or trade secrets.
<P>

103   	In clause 15(B)(3) there is the contemplation that the
parties may enter into a "Successor Agreement", being a further Franchise
Agreement after the termination of the existing Agreement.  This assumed some
importance in the litigation, the question being the
circumstances in which,
either by virtue of the agreement or of further arrangements into which the
parties entered, HJPL was entitled
to call for a continuation of the Franchise
Agreements for the "successor restaurants".
<P>

The Letters And Notices Of 21 March 1996
<P>

104   	On 21 March 1996 Mr Fitzjohn wrote to Mr Cowin referring
to "a considerable degree of dissatisfaction", which had arisen
"in respect of
the manner in which the parties perceive their respective obligations under the
Development and Service Agreements".
<P>

105   	The letter continued:-
<P>

"As you know, the context of Ray's statement in August was that our efforts to
combine resources in a way not contemplated by the
existing Agreements had
failed.  His point was that if we also fail to negotiate a joint venture, then
the failure of our attempts
to work together more closely would result in our
continued co-operation under the terms of the Development and Service
Agreements.
<P>

This is in fact what happened, and each of us now expects the other to act in
compliance with those Agreements.  Unfortunately,
it now appears that you are
not willing or able to adhere to the terms of the Development and Service
Agreements.  In particular,
we feel that you have been unresponsive to issues
raised on our side, such as operational defaults and unauthorised
sub-licensing.
 You have also failed to follow up on your agreements in areas
such as the need to have our solicitors review proposed media.  In
short, you
have not lived up to your side of the bargain.  I have no desire to spend more
money than is necessary on lawyers, but
I also intend to insist on compliance
with the previously negotiated contracts.
<P>

I have considered your proposal with input from Ray Miolla and other members of
the Asia Pacific team over the last several weeks
and we have agreed that
non-binding mediation will not be productive.  Instead, we believe it is best
to approach the problem by
following the terms of the existing agreements.  
<P>

I propose to begin this process by providing you with a formal notice of the
areas where we believe you have breached the agreements.
 <u>You will then have
the stated grace periods to cure these defaults and preserve your rights under
the contracts</u>.  If you do so, we can then proceed to resolve our disputes
over the exact meaning of the contracts pursuant to the stated dispute
resolution provisions in the contracts.
<P>

Enclosed is a formal notice from our Legal Department which will begin the
process.  I regret this must be sent by fax, but that
is the requirement set
forth in the agreements.  I hope the process can be as amicable as possible,
but I recognise that the next
few months will be a difficult time for all of
us."  (My emphasis.)
<P>

106   	The Notices stated that they were forwarded under clauses
3.2 and 15 of the Development Agreement and 2.2 and 12.1 of the
Service
Agreement.  The letter enclosed copies of the Australian Guidelines for Expert
Determination "which we propose as the set
of rules to govern arbitration of
any disputes arising as a result of these Notices".
<P>

107   	The Notice under clause 3.2 of the Development Agreement
quoted certain of that clause and stated that the initial five year
term
expired on 12 November 1995, and that no notice had been given to BKC by HJPL
of its intention to renew the agreement.  It continued:-
<P>

"If no written notice is received by Burger King Corporation by 4 pm .. March
1996 as to Hungry Jack's Pty Limited's intention to
renew the Development
Agreement, the Development Agreement will be at an end and will be treated as
such by Burger King Corporation."
<P>

108   	The Notice under clause 15 stated that if "HJPL shall
have failed to cure the breaches of the Development Agreement set out
below
within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt by HJPL of this Notice, the
Development Agreement terminates".  The particulars
of the breaches, which I
summarise, were:-
<P>

(a)	that HJPL had failed to satisfy fully the operational requirements set
forth in clause 4 in the day to day operation of a Burger
King restaurant
because:-
<P>

(i)	HJPL had not conducted each restaurant in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Development Agreement, the applicable
Franchise Agreements,
and the standards, specifications and procedures specified in the volumes
comprising the Manual of Operating
Data, as amended, including the maintenance
of interior and exterior of the restaurants to reflect an acceptable Burger
King image;
<P>

(ii)	at the beginning of 1995 BKC provided HJPL with its Expansion Policy and
Operational Expansion Criteria; that there were meetings
between Mr Horowitz
and Mr Green about a Franchise Action Plan; that when that plan was initiated
there were approximately 36 HJPL
restaurants in the Needs Improvement category
and as at the end of that Plan there were still 31 restaurants in that
category, and
that:-
<P>

	"Although Roy Blauer of BKC offered in the Notice of Disapproval dated
November 27, 1995 to meet and discuss a plan to cure this
default over an
agreed period of time, no progress has been made and BKC withdraws this offer";

<P>

(iii)	HJPL had been aware for over twelve months of serious problems in the
conduct of restaurants in Queensland by reason of unacceptably
high
temperatures;
<P>

(iv)	HJPL was in breach of its obligations not to assign, relevantly for
present purposes, by assigning to Messrs Hawryluk and Deugarde;
<P>

(v)	HJPL was in breach of the Development Agreement in relation to the
advertising fund; in failing to submit promotional material
to BKC for
approval; in providing inaccurate information to prospective third party
franchisees, including Messrs Cox, Soo and McKinnon;
in failing to pay the
proper royalty amount, having regard to other breaches; in failing to use trade
marks properly, which involved
the purported withdrawal by BKC of a waiver
previously made; in acting adversely to the interests of BKC; and in divulging
trade
secrets.
<P>

The Notice stated that if HJPL should "fail to remedy all of the
above-mentioned breaches by the expiration of the said thirty (30)
days period
the Development Agreement will terminate as of that date".
<P>

109   	The Notice ended on that note and referred to the dispute
resolution procedures in clause 14.  It stated:-
<P>

"As the continuation/termination of the Development Agreement is of primary
commercial importance to BKC, BKC requires that HJPL
provide it with notice of
any factual or legal matter referred to or arising out of the above Notice
which it disputes within fourteen
(14) days of receipt of this Notice.
<P>

Should a notice of dispute be given by HJPL it is suggested by BKC that
immediate steps be taken to have the matters in dispute
resolved in a manner
binding on the parties by means of Expert Determination in accordance with the
Rules for Binding Expert Determination
of the Australian Commercial Dispute
Center.
<P>

Should no such notification be received by BKC within the time stipulated BKC
will deem HJPL as having accepted the validity of
the above Notice and the
factual correctness of the assertions made in the above Notice, and will
continue to monitor HJPL's conduct
in remedying the breaches referred to in the
above Notice."
<P>

110   	The Notice under clause 2.2 of the Service Agreement
related to the requirement to renew it and to the fact that that had
not
occurred.  It ended in the same way as the Notice pursuant to clause 3.2.
<P>

111   	The Notice under clause 12.1 of the Service Agreement set
out a number of breaches, which HJPL was required to cure within
ninety days of
the date of receipt, otherwise the Service Agreement would terminate.  That
Notice concluded in essentially the same
way as the Notice given pursuant to
clause 15.1 of the Development Agreement.
<P>

112   	Subsequently HJPL gave notice of its intention to renew
the Agreements.  It was not in issue that they were thereby renewed,
or, at
least, no point was taken that they had not been.  Nor was it in issue that no
steps were taken to terminate either Agreement
pursuant to the provisions of
the Notices of Default. None-the-less, it is relevant to consider the breaches
alleged in the Notices
given under clause 15 of the Development Agreement when
considering the Notices of Termination.
<P>

113   	HJPL attacked the validity of the Notices by commencing
proceedings seeking declarations in relation to the correspondence
and Notices
of March 1996 in the Equity Division.  Portion, at least, of those proceedings
was referred to the Honourable T.R. Morling
of Queen's Counsel, who reported to
the Court on 23 May 1996.  It seemed to be common ground that this report was
never submitted
to the Court for adoption.  In essence, Mr Morling concluded
that there were insufficient particulars furnished to enable HJPL to
be aware
of the defaults it was required to remedy.  In the course of making that report
he expressed the opinion that BKC may purport
to terminate the Development
Agreement because of a breach, which it claimed was not capable of being cured,
and that such a purported
termination would give rise to a dispute which could
be made the subject of a notification under clause 14.  He noted submissions
that such a notification did not operate to extend the times referred to in
clause 15.2, and that to achieve the result contended
for by HJPL an implied
term must be found in the Development Agreement to the effect that time for
compliance with a Notice given
under clause 15.2 did not commence to run until
the expiration of the forty five day period referred to in clause 14.  The
contrary
submission was that this would contradict the express terms of clause
15.2.  Whilst Mr Morling saw the force of the submissions of
HJPL, he did not
think they should prevail.  He said he was not unmindful of the commercial
dilemma in which HJPL was placed by service
upon it of the Notice under clause
15.2, because non-compliance gave rise to the risk of termination with grave
commercial and financial
consequences.
<P>

114   	At paragraph 46 Mr Morling said that he had referred to
the "possible Draconian consequences of failure to comply with a
Notice under
clause 15.2", and that those consequences were so serious:-
<P>

".. as to require a notice to specify with clarity and precision the alleged
breaches of the Agreement.  The time limits referred
to in clause 15.2 are so
short (having regard to the magnitude of Hungry Jack's business and to the
complexity of the business relationship
which exists between Hungry Jack's and
BKC) that Hungry Jack's was entitled to be placed in the position that
immediately upon reading
the notice it knew exactly what it was required to
do."
<P>

He was of the view that the Notice did not achieve this result.  It will be
relevant, in considering the breaches specified in the
Longer Notice, to have
regard to those stated in the Notice of 21 March 1996, particularly in
considering BKC's submission that certain
breaches were incapable of cure.
However, BKC does not rely on the March 1996 Notices for present purposes.
<P>

The Notices Of Termination
<P>

115   	On 18 November 1996, Mr Miolla wrote two letters to Mr
Cowin enclosing Notices of Termination.  One letter dealt with the
Development
Agreement and enclosed a Notice of Termination under clauses 2.1 and 15.1, and
a further Notice of Termination under
clause 15.  The letter concluded:-
<P>

"The terms of both notices are self-explanatory, and the Development Agreement
is thereby terminated upon the date of your receipt
of this Notice of
Termination."
<P>

116   	The other letter referred to the Service Agreement and
enclosed a Notice of Default under clause 12.1, and a Notice to Perform
and a
Letter of Instruction pursuant to it.  The letter stated, inter alia:-
<P>

"The Notice to Perform and Letter of Instruction are delivered in addition to
the Notice of Default and does (sic) not in any way
constitute a waiver or
modification of the Notice of Default."
<P>

117   	The first Notice of Termination under the Development
Agreement, ("the Shorter Notice"), asserted that clause 15.1(d) entitled
BKC to
terminate it if HJPL failed to comply with any of the other terms, provisions,
or conditions of the Agreement, any Franchise
Agreement, or any other
obligation owed to BKC.
<P>

118   	The notice set forth clause 2.1 of the Development
Agreement requiring the opening of a minimum of four new Burger King
Restaurants
per annum in Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland, and
continued that between 12 November 1995 and 11 November 1996
HJPL developed and
opened only one new Burger King Restaurant in those States, and that BKC
franchisees introduced by HJPL developed
and opened no new Burger King
Restaurants in them.  The notice concluded that "accordingly" BKC "hereby
terminates" the Development
Agreement.
<P>

119   	BKC conceded that it had not notified HJPL of this
alleged breach, conformably with clause 15.2, and afforded it the opportunity
to cure it.  The submission on its behalf was that that clause was only
activated if the breach was one capable of being cured, and
that this was not
such a breach as the period within which those restaurants were required to be
opened had passed.  Therefore, so
it was submitted, the breach could not be
cured because the restaurants could not be opened within the time specified.
Further, Mr
Bathurst conceded that even if 30 days' notice to cure the alleged
breach had been given, HJPL would not have been able to do so
within that time.
However, his submissions were that the time to cure the default, which was a
default capable of cure, was governed
by clause 8.1, which provided for this
particular type of default.  He submitted that in any event there was no
default because the
reason the restaurants had not been opened was BKC's
improper refusal to grant operational and financial approval and to allow third
party franchisees to open restaurants.  Nextly he submitted that if, contrary
to his primary submission, clause 15 governed the position,
the breach was one
capable of cure; that on a proper construction of the Development Agreement
that meant that notice to cure had
to be given even though, as he conceded a
cure could not be effected within 30 days; and that clause 15 therefore imposed
a condition
precedent to the giving of a Notice to Terminate, with which BKC
had failed to comply.  He submitted that on a proper construction
clause 15
meant a breach "capable of cure", which if not cured within 30 days entitled
BKC to terminate, not a breach "capable of
cure within 30 days".  It was
essentially around these issues that the validity of the Shorter Notice is to
be determined.
<P>

Some Matters Pleaded
<P>

120   	It is convenient, at this point, to set out some of the
matters pleaded by HJPL.  That is so because they reflect, to some
extent, on
the issues raised by the Shorter Notice, and also, to a far more significant
extent, on those raised by the Longer Notice.
<P>

121   	HJPL has pleaded that BKC breached the Development and
Service Agreements in a number of ways.  In paragraph 48 it alleged
that the
following were terms of those agreements and the Franchise Agreements, which
were implied by law, namely that:-
<P>

(a)	BKC must act in good faith towards HJPL in exercising its rights;
<P>

(b)	BKC would not terminate, or purport to terminate, those agreements if the
grounds on which it purported to act were caused by
breaches of them by BKC;
<P>

(c)	BKC would do all that was reasonably necessary to enable HJPL to enjoy the
benefits of them;
<P>

(d)	BKC would not take any action, which would prevent HJPL from complying with
its obligations under them;
<P>

(e)	BKC would exercise its rights to terminate them in good faith or,
alternatively, reasonably; and
<P>

(f)	BKC must not act in bad faith and/or unreasonably withhold financial and/or
operational approval to HJPL under the Development
Agreement so as to deprive
it of the opportunity to satisfy the requirements of the Development
Schedule.
<P>

The last mentioned term was also pleaded as "implied in fact".
<P>

122   	In paragraph 49 it was pleaded that since about August
1995, or, alternatively, 22 November 1995, BKC withheld financial
and/or
operational approval under the Development Agreement, and denied HJPL the
opportunity:-
<P>

(a)	to open Burger King restaurants in Western Australia, South Australia and
Queensland so as to comply with the Development Schedule;
<P>

(b)	to introduce third party franchisees to open such restaurants in those
States to comply with the Development Schedule; and
<P>

(c)	itself to open restaurants and to introduce third party franchisees to open
such restaurants in other States.
<P>

Detailed particulars were given of these allegations.
<P>

123   	In paragraph 50 it was pleaded that BKC's assertion that
HJPL failed to comply with its requirements for financial and/or
operational
approval under the Development Agreement was made, and each of the actions
pleaded in paragraph 49 was taken, in breach
of the terms pleaded in paragraph
48.  It was said that that purpose was to be inferred from the facts, matters
and circumstances
particularised in paragraphs 32 and 61; and from the fact
that BKC's decision to refuse HJPL operational approval for further expansion
was based on reports by BKC employees in respect of thirty one Burger King
restaurants operated by HJPL, which were classified according
to subjective and
undisclosed criteria to be in a "needs improvement" category, as communicated
by BKC to HJPL in a memorandum from
Mr Horowitz.
<P>

124   	Paragraph 61 pleaded that the Shorter Notice was
ineffective to terminate the Development Agreement, or alternatively was
void
or unenforceable, by reason that:-
<P>

(a)	the alleged breach of clause 2.1 of the Development Agreement by HJPL was
caused by BKC's prior breaches of it as pleaded in
paragraphs 49 to 52;
<P>

(b)	HJPL was, at all material times, ready, willing and able to comply with
clause 2.1 of the Development Agreement but was prevented
from so doing by the
wrongful refusal of BKC, from at least 20 September 1995, to grant HJPL
financial and/or operational approval
for further expansion;
<P>

(c)	on the proper construction of clause 2.1 of the Development Agreement, HJPL
had complied with the Development Schedule, it being
alleged that in the five
years between 1990 and 1995 it had opened twenty five restaurants in Western
Australia, South Australia
and Queensland and introduced one third party
franchisee (other than Shell) to BKC in South Australia, and, further or
alternatively,
HJPL introduced Shell to BKC and by reason, inter alia, of the
joint venture to which BKC was a party, Shell opened Burger King restaurants
in
Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland in the relevant period.  It
was pleaded that the introduction took place as
a result of dealings between
HJPL and Shell in about December 1989, or, alternatively, between Shell and
HJPL in relation to the
proposed Westgate Bridge site between August and
October 1991, and in relation to the Kingsway site during September 1993, and
steps
subsequently taken by HJPL to progress the placement of "test sites" in
Shell service stations, including meetings between Shell
and HJPL held on
certain specified dates; 
<P>

(d)	further and alternatively, clause 8.1 of the Development Agreement provided
a period of one year following any failure on the
part of HJPL to adhere to the
Development Schedule in which to make good such failure, which alleged failure
was denied, and that
the period of one year did not expire until 12 November
1997; and
<P>

(e)	further and alternatively, by reason of the participation of HJPL and BKC
in the joint venture pleaded in paragraph 24, BKC
accepted HJPL's participation
in that joint venture and/or in the development of the test sites as sufficient
compliance with the
Development Schedule.
<P>

125   	Paragraph 61A pleaded:-
<P>

"Further and in the alternative to paragraph 61, in answer to the default
alleged in the Shorter Notice as pleaded in paragraph
60 above, BKC failed to
give notice of the nature of the alleged default to HJPL in accordance with
clause 15.2 of the Development
Agreement prior to issuing the Shorter Notice,
and is not entitled to terminate that agreement by reason of that alleged
default."
<P>

126   	In paragraph 51 it was pleaded that it was a further term
of the Development Agreement that BKC must not seek to impose a
condition upon
the grant of approval for HJPL to open Burger King restaurants, which would
deny HJPL its contractual rights under
the Development Agreement.  It was
pleaded that this term was implied by law.
<P>

127   	Paragraph 52 asserted that in breach of the term pleaded
in paragraph 51, at least from 13 February 1995, BKC sought to require
HJPL to
enter into TRA's in a form required by BKC, and thereby to waive its rights
under clause 7.3 of the Development Agreement,
as a condition of obtaining
BKC's approval to open further Burger King restaurants; and declined to permit
HJPL to reserve further
sites for expansion unless it entered into a TRA for
each such site.
<P>

128   	Paragraph 53 pleaded that by reason of the matters
pleaded in paragraphs 49 to 52, HJPL suffered loss and damage, in that
it lost
the opportunity to secure further sites for expansion in Western Australia,
South Australia and Queensland by opening Burger
King restaurants at those
sites so as to comply with the Development Schedule and earn profits, and to
secure further sites for expansion
in other Australian States and to open
Burger King restaurants at those sites and to earn profits therefrom.  It also
particularised
that HJPL had lost the opportunity to secure such sites for
expansion, and those sites have now been reserved by third parties including
Shell.  The particulars continued that HJPL lost the opportunity to open
further Burger King sites for which it had sought approval
from BKC and for
which it would have sought approval but for BKC's conduct pleaded in paragraph
49, and to earn profits therefrom,
and, further, that HJPL has been exposed to
the purported termination of the Development Agreement by BKC based on an
alleged failure
to comply with the Development Schedule.
<P>

129   	The second Notice of Termination, ("the Longer Notice"),
relied on breaches of clauses 15.1(c), 6.5 and, in a number of respects,
15.1(d).  Once again it was not in issue that no notice had been given
requiring the defaults to be cured, the essential submission
of BKC being that
they were not defaults capable of being cured.  As I have said, these
submissions have to be viewed in the light
of the Notice of March 1996
requiring a number of breaches to be cured.
<P>

130   	Commencing at paragraph 62 the Summons dealt with the
Longer Notice.  I propose, in setting forth the allegations, to state
the
conclusions to which I have come in relation to each.  In doing so I shall make
the assumption, for reasons to which I shall
refer, that each alleged breach
was capable of being cured, on a proper construction of clause 15.2 and that,
accordingly, it was
necessary for BKC to give a notice to cure before
purporting to exercise the right to terminate.  The Summons considered firstly
the alleged breaches arising from the arrangements with Messrs Hawryluk and
Deugarde.  In paragraph 52 it pleaded that the Longer
Notice asserted breaches
of certain terms because of arrangements between HJPL and Mr Hawryluk and Mr
Deugarde concerning, respectively,
Burger King restaurants in Labrador,
Queensland between early 1995 and 1 August 1996, and in Morphett Vale, South
Australia since
July 1995.
<P>

131   	In paragraph 63 it asserted that BKC was not entitled to
rely on those allegations to terminate the Development Agreement
because:-
<P>

(a)	it was unable to make good the factual basis of them, or alternatively the
facts did not constitute a breach by HJPL of the
various clauses;
<P>

(b)	BKC asserted the same, or substantially the same, facts in the March 1996
Notices as being a breach, which was curable in accordance
with clause 15.2 of
the Development Agreement, and HJPL cured the breaches by terminating all
arrangements with Mr Hawryluk and Mr
Deugarde after service of the March 1996
Notices;
<P>

(c)	BKC was estopped from relying on clause 15.1 because it was, at all times,
aware of the arrangements and HJPL relied upon its
failure to object to them;
and
<P>

(d)	the alleged breaches are "immaterial and/or stale and/or any purported
reliance by BKC upon" them involves its breach of the
terms pleaded in
paragraph 48.  The last particular was pleaded in respect of each of the
alleged breaches and I shall not repeat
it.
<P>

132   	In my opinion, this was a breach which, if notice had
been given whilst it was subsisting, was capable of being cured.  So
much could
not have been in issue having regard to the March 1996 notice.  Although Mr
Oslington did not conceded that the relationships
between HJPL and Messrs
Hawryluk and Deugarde had been brought to an end prior to the giving of the
Notice of Termination, he made
no submission that they had not.  The evidence
satisfies me that this did happen and that BKC was advised.  Even if that is
not correct,
the alleged breaches were clearly capable of being cured and
before reliance could be placed on them to terminate the agreement,
notice to
cure had to be given and the time given to effect it had passed without any
cure being effected.
<P>

133   	Mr Oslington also submitted that the breach was not
capable of being cured because HJPL had made each aware of confidential
information relating to BKC.  However, this was information which had to be
made available to a range of people employed by or in
a contractual
relationship with HJPL, and there can be no suggestion that it was improper, in
itself, to make the information available
to them.  Further, the March 1996
Notice considered that the alleged failure to "maintain the secrecy and
confidentiality of all
BKC proprietary information" was capable of being
cured.
<P>

134   	Finally, he submitted, I think, that if the breach had
been cured before the giving of the Notice, it was no longer one which
was
capable of being cured and, therefore, the breach having occurred, BKC was not
obliged to give notice to cure, as that had happened.
 I reject that
submission.  In March 1996, BKC was aware of the facts giving rise to these
alleged breaches.  It called on HJPL to
cure them, which I am satisfied HJPL
did.  The effect of the breaches was therefore, in my opinion, spent.  To
submit that one could
give notice requiring a breach to be cured and then,
after it has been cured conformably with the notice, to give a notice of
termination
on the basis that there had been a breach which was no longer
capable of being cured is an untenable submission.  Further, in my
view, BKC
was estopped from relying on those breaches by its conduct to which I have
referred.
<P>

135   	HJPL nextly pleaded in relation to the "sunglasses
promotion".  It referred, in paragraph 64, to allegations of breach of
the
Development Agreement and specified Franchise Agreements in relation to the
promotion involving the sale of "Shades" sunglasses
from 18 to 24 September
1996 in Burger King restaurants in Western Australia in contravention of
s.65C(1)(a) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a>.  That section prohibits a
corporation, in trade or commerce, from supplying goods intended to be used or
likely to be used by a
consumer if the goods are of a kind in respect of which
there is a prescribed consumer product safety standard with which the goods
do
not comply.
<P>

136   	In paragraph 65 it was pleaded that BKC was not entitled
to rely upon that allegation to terminate the Development Agreement
because:-
<P>

(a)	a single contravention of that section did not constitute a failure to
adhere "to all applicable statutory regulations within
the meaning of clause
6.5 of the Development Agreement".  That clause provided:-
<P>

	"Hungry Jack's agrees to adhere to all applicable statutory regulations and to
BKC's advertising, sales promotion and public relations
standards and all
advertisements and other materials published circulated or exhibited shall
first be approved by BKC.  The franchisee
agrees to remove or discontinue
immediately the use of any objectionable advertising material upon receipt of
BKC's notice; BKC or
its authorised agent may at all reasonable times enter the
premises to remove and destroy objectionable material without compensation
to
franchisee."
<P>

It would appear that s.65C(1)(a) was an applicable statutory regulation with
which HJPL was obliged to comply, and Mr Bathurst did
not seek to support a
view, which may have been open on the pleadings, that a breach of one statutory
provision was insufficient
to attract clause 6.5;
<P>

(b)	BKC's rights against HJPL for a breach of clause 6.5 are regulated solely
by it, and not by clause 15.1, and BKC did not give
notice to remove or
discontinue immediately the use "of any objectionable advertising material";

<P>

(c)	alternatively, if BKC's rights were otherwise regulated by clause 15.1, it
failed to give notice of the nature of the alleged
default to HJPL and to
afford it the opportunity to cure it in accordance with clause 15.2; or any
breach was one which could have
been cured by the removal of the sunglasses
and/or remedial advertising; and
<P>

(d)	BKC is estopped from relying on clause 15.1 because it was at all times
aware of the intended promotion and HJPL relied upon
BKC's failure to object to
it.
<P>

137   	In my opinion, the breach, if it was one to which clause
15 applied, was capable of being cured and, hence notice to do so
should have
been given before there was any purported termination.  In this case the
promotion was stopped by the intervention of
the relevant regulatory authority.
The circumstances necessary for it to be stopped, as provided by clause 6.5,
therefore, did not
arise.  In my opinion, the circumstances necessary to give
rise to termination did not arise, unless it could be said, in the sense
of the
first allegation, that the breach was not capable of being cured, which I would
reject for the same reason, or that the breach
was not capable of being cured
because the conduct brought trade marks or product into such disrepute that
making good the breach,
in the manner required by the regulatory authority,
could never remove the stigma thus created.  I reject this submission also.
There
was no evidence that any stigma was caused to BKC's or HJPL's name, trade
marks or products, and the March 1996 Notice obviously
contemplated that such
matters were capable of being cured.
<P>

138   	In my opinion, an equally effective answer is that BKC's
remedy lay in clause 6.5 and, for the reasons given, it became unnecessary
to
exercise it.  As the breach was remedied by the intervention of the regulatory
authority it could not be said by BKC, essentially
for the reasons I have
given, that a breach had occurred, which, even though remedied prior to the
purported termination, gave a
right to terminate.
<P>

139   	At paragraph 66 HJPL commenced to consider allegations
that it breached clause 6.5 and specified Franchise Agreements by
failing to
seek or obtain approval for advertisements and other materials published,
circulated or exhibited by it.  In paragraph
67 it pleaded that BKC was not
entitled to rely upon the allegation because:-
<P>

(a)	its rights against HJPL for a breach of clause 6.5 were regulated entirely
by the terms of that clause, and not by clause 15.1,
and BKC failed to give a
notice requiring it to remove or discontinue immediately the advertisements or
to take any other action
in accordance with clause 6.5; and 
<P>

(b)	BKC was estopped from alleging that these allegations constituted a breach
of clause 6.5 in circumstances where, to BKC's knowledge,
HJPL had always been
responsible for all advertising in Australia, had conducted such advertising
without reference to BKC for its
approval, and had kept BKC advised of
advertising campaigns to be undertaken by HJPL upon which HJPL had relied; and,
in October
1995, BKC advised HJPL that it would be sufficient for HJPL to
submit a marketing plan and agency brief to BKC at quarterly intervals
for
approval, with which requirement HJPL had complied.
<P>

140   	I consider that BKC's attempted termination on these
grounds cannot succeed for two reasons.  Firstly, I agree with HJPL's
primary
submission that BKC's remedy in relation to advertising was governed by clause
6.5.  It was not in issue that no notice under
that clause had been given.
Alternatively, if the right to terminate arose from clause 15, the breach was
clearly capable of being
cured and no notice requiring that to be done had been
given.
<P>

141   	At paragraph 68 it was pleaded that the Longer Notice
alleged that HJPL was in breach of various clauses of the Development
Agreement
by reason of the use of a previous Hungry Jack's logo; the failure to use the
tag line "Hungry Jack's is a registered trademark
of Burger King Corporation.
Used under licence"; the failure to capitalise the words "Hungry Jack's";
and/or the failure to use a
mark in various specified advertisements.  In
paragraph 69 it was pleaded that HJPL was in breach of the Registered User
Agreement
by reason thereof and, in paragraph 70, that BKC was not, and is not,
entitled to rely upon the trademark allegation to terminate
the Development
Agreement because BKC's rights against HJPL for a breach of clause 6.5 were
regulated entirely by its terms, and
not by clause 15.1, and BKC failed to give
notice requiring HJPL to remove or discontinue immediately the alleged
offending advertisements
and promotions, or to take any other action in
accordance with clause 6.5.
<P>

142   	It was also pleaded that BKC could not terminate on this
ground because it asserted the same or essentially the same facts
in the March
1996 Notices as being a breach curable in accordance with clause 15.2, and HJPL
cured the alleged breach by, inter alia,
instructing its agents to correct any
misuse of trademarks and to ensure that trademarks were properly utilised in
all advertisements
and other material, thereby complying with the provisions of
clause 15.2.
<P>

143   	I consider, essentially for the reasons I gave in
relation to the advertising complaints, that HJPL's contentions, in this
regard, must be accepted.  Mr Oslington also submitted that the misuse of the
trade marks placed them in jeopardy, such that they
may be lost.  In these
circumstances he submitted that the breaches could never be cured because they
remained as some evidence of
misuse, which could, together with other
misconduct in relation to them, lead to their loss.  However, he conceded that
the breaches,
of which complaint was made, could not, of themselves, lead to
the loss of the trade marks or, relevantly, put them in jeopardy.
 In my
opinion, such breaches as had occurred were, within the meaning of the
Development Agreement, capable of being cured.  This
was the view BKC took when
it gave its Notice of March 1996 and, in my opinion, that was a correct
approach.
<P>

144   	Commencing at paragraph 71 consideration was given to the
bubble blower promotion in Woodridge, it being pleaded that BKC
alleged that
HJPL was in breach of clause 6.5 by reason of the promotion of a bubble blower
in Woodridge in October 1996 in conjunction
with a logo, which bubble blower
had not been submitted to BKC for approval.  It was pleaded, in paragraph 72,
that BKC was not,
and is not, entitled to rely upon the alleged bubble blower
breach to terminate the Development Agreement because its rights against
HJPL
for a breach of clause 6.5 are entirely regulated by its terms, and not by
clause 15.1, and BKC failed to give notice requiring
HJPL to remove or
discontinue immediately the promotion of the bubble blower or to take any other
action in accordance with clause
6.5.
<P>

145   	For the reasons I have given in relation to advertising,
I do not consider that BKC was entitled to terminate for this alleged
breach.
<P>

146   	Beginning at paragraph 73, the allegation in relation to
obligations under the Service Agreement was pleaded being the alleged
defaults
in the Notices dated 14 November 1996 issued under it.  It was pleaded that BKC
was not entitled to rely on those allegations
because:-
<P>

(a)	it was unable to substantiate or rely upon the alleged breaches of the
Service Agreement for the reasons set out in paragraphs
87 to 93;
<P>

(b)	by issuing a notice in November 1996 under the Service Agreement requiring
that the alleged faults be corrected within ninety
days, BKC elected to require
HJPL to cure the alleged defaults under that agreement and was not entitled to
rely upon them as a ground
for termination of the Development Agreement;
<P>

(c)	the alleged defaults did not constitute a failure to provide services
required to be provided under the Service Agreement to
any designated
franchisee for the purposes of clause 12.1 of that agreement and, accordingly,
BKC was not entitled to terminate the
Service Agreement; and
<P>

(d)	on 5 March 1997 BKC advised HJPL that the training facilities provided by
HJPL in Perth, Adelaide, Brisbane and Melbourne were
consistent with the
requirements of the Development Agreement.
<P>

147   	Clause 15.1(d) provided that an occurrence entitling BKC
to terminate the Development Agreement is a failure to comply with
"any other
obligation owed to BKC".  HJPL clearly owed obligations to BKC under the
Service Agreement.  That agreement provided its
own regime for the curing of
breaches under it of which BKC had availed itself by giving a ninety day notice
to cure the breaches
in November 1996.  BKC could not, in those circumstances,
rely on those breaches, (assuming there were breaches), within the ninety
day
period, because, on a proper construction of the Service Agreement, there had
not been a failure to comply with the obligations
under the Service Agreement.
That failure could only arise if there was non-compliance with the Notice.  The
further problem arises
that even if it did not cure the breaches within ninety
days, they remained breaches capable of being cured, and, arguably, further
notice to cure had to be given, pursuant to clause 15.2, before there could be
termination.
<P>

148   	Finally, Mr Oslington, in final submissions, said that he
did not propose to address on the Service Agreement on the basis
that if he
could not succeed on the other allegations, these would not avail BKC.
<P>

149   	In paragraph 75 it was pleaded that the alleged breaches
upon which BKC relied by the provision by HJPL of written material
to three
potential franchisees, namely Messrs McKinnon, Mrs Soo and Mr Cox, could not be
relied upon because, as was asserted in
paragraph 76:-
<P>

(a)	HJPL did not provide written material to Mrs Soo or Mr Cox as alleged;
<P>

(b)	if, which was denied, HJPL provided any such written material to Messrs
McKinnon, Mrs Soo and/or Mr Cox, it did not involve
any misrepresentation;
<P>

(c)	BKC was estopped from alleging that these allegations were in breach of
clause 15.1 in circumstances where BKC was aware of
the substance of those
complaints and of the actions taken by HJPL to address them, and HJPL relied
upon BKC's acquiescence in respect
of HJPL's conduct in doing so; and
<P>

(d)	by requesting HJPL to give notice of its intention to renew the Development
Agreement by notices issued on 21 and 25 March 1996,
pursuant to clause 3.2 of
the Development Agreement, BKC elected to waive the breaches alleged.
<P>

In my opinion, BKC's request to HJPL to renew the Development Agreement with
knowledge of the furnishing of this material was as
clear a waiver as could be
of the alleged breaches.  Further, BKC considered, when it gave the March 1996
Notice, that these breaches
were capable of cure.
<P>

150   	In paragraph 77 the Summons asserted that the breaches
alleged by BKC of the Franchise Agreement dated 2 November 1991 in
relation to
the operation of a restaurant at Mount Gravatt in Queensland by reason of
voluntary abandonment of that restaurant could
not, as alleged in paragraph 78,
be relied upon by BKC to determine the Development Agreement because BKC was
estopped from alleging
that those alleged breaches were in breach of the
Development Agreement, as BKC and/or Mr Power were aware of the impending
closure
of the Burger King restaurant at Mount Gravatt due to the expiry of the
lease for that restaurant and assented to that closure; and
BKC had not
previously contended that the closure of BKC restaurants by HJPL, prior to
expiry of the full term of the franchise and
after notice to BKC, was a breach
of the Development Agreement. 
<P>

The evidence established that BKC was aware that the shopping centre, in which
this restaurant was situated, was to be remodelled,
that this would involve the
closure of it and, in those circumstances it consented to that course.  This
was corroborated by the
failure of BKC to complain, prior to the Notice of
Termination, about this having happened.  In these circumstances, BKC cannot be
heard to say that the closure amounted to a breach of the Development
Agreement.  Even if it did, it was capable of being cured by
re-opening when
the remodelling was finished, a course which BKC opposed, thus, relevantly,
failing to comply with the implied term
of co-operation.
<P>

151   	Commencing at paragraph 79 it was asserted that BKC was
not entitled to rely on the issue of a letter of 22 September 1995
addressed
"To Whom It May Concern", in which it was stated that the purpose of the letter
was to confirm that Mr Chris Ryan was an
approved franchisee of HJPL as from 18
September 1995 as constituting a breach of clause 9B of the Franchise
Agreements, because
BKC was not, and is not, entitled to rely upon the
allegation in paragraph 79 to terminate the Development Agreement as the
matters
alleged did not constitute a breach of clause 9B; and by a facsimile
transmission dated 24 July 1996 from BKC to HJPL, BKC elected
to require HJPL
to remedy any such breach by further educating Mr Honkey as to the limits of
his authority. In final submissions,
Mr Oslington agreed that if he could not
succeed on other grounds, he could not succeed on this one.  In the result it
is not necessary
to consider it further.
<P>

152   	In relation to the Service Agreement it was alleged in
the Notice of Default that that had been breached in various specified
ways.
It concluded that under clause 12.1 BKC may terminate the Service Agreement
upon giving ninety days' notice to HJPL of a specified
default, if such default
is not rectified within the notice period, and:-
<P>

"BKC notifies HJPL that unless the defaults referred to above are rectified
within ninety (90) days from the date of this Notice,
BKC will at the
expiration of ninety (90) days of this Notice be entitled to terminate the
Service Agreement pursuant to clause 12.1
of the Service Agreement."
<P>

Accordingly, as I understand it, BKC was seeking to terminate the Development
Agreement by reference to breaches of the Service
Agreement, which it had
required HJPL to remedy. I have referred to this. It was not in issue that BKC
did not seek to terminate
the Service Agreement at any stage.  It had pleaded,
as I have noted, that that agreement had been frustrated, but this assertion
was not pursued.
<P>

153   	In final submissions Mr Oslington stated that he had not,
and did not propose to, address on the obligations under the Service
Agreement
pleaded in paragraphs 73-74; the Chris Ryan allegations pleaded in paragraphs
79-80; and the Fudge brownie allegation pleaded
in paragraphs 93F-G, on the
basis that if he could not succeed on the other allegations, these would not
avail BKC.
<P>

154   	In my opinion, for all these reasons, BKC has failed to
establish that the Longer Notice was a valid notice terminating the
Development
Agreement.
<P>

The Notice of Termination Dated 8 September 1997
<P>

155   	By letter dated 8 September 1997, BKC sent to HJPL a
document purporting to be a Notice of Termination under clause 15.1(d)
of the
Development Agreement.  The letter concluded:-
<P>

"The terms of the Notice are self-explanatory and the Development Agreement is
terminated (if not already terminated due to prior
Notices of Termination sent
to you on November 18, 1996) upon the date of your receipt of this Notice."
<P>

156   	The Notice of Termination recited, in effect, that by the
two Notices dated 18 November 1996 BKC terminated the Development
Agreement;
that HJPL alleged that those two Notices were invalid and denied the Agreement
had been terminated, and, on 26 November
1996, commenced proceedings in this
Court challenging their validity; that BKC maintained that the Agreement had
been validly terminated;
that in the event that it be held that it had not been
"BKC hereby gives notice to" HJPL "of the following breaches by HJPL of the
Development Agreement"; and that the Notice of 8 September 1997 was given
"without prejudice" to any or all of BKC's rights arising
from its "prior
termination" of the Agreement.  Clause 15.1(d) was quoted and thereafter
particulars of breach were set forth.  The
first eight breaches upon which
reliance was placed related to continuing to operate specified restaurants in
breach of the Franchise
Agreement.
<P>

157   	The first restaurant was at Fulham in South Australia, it
being alleged that on 9 May 1979 BKC entered into a franchise with
HJPL in
respect of it.  A number of terms of the Franchise Agreement were recited and
it was asserted that pursuant to clause IIIC,
it expired on 8 May 1994 and,
thereafter, BKC and HJPL entered into a number of agreements to extend it, the
last being dated 17
May 1996 and expiring on 15 November 1996.  The particular
breach was that from such expiration HJPL continued to operate the restaurant
and to use trademarks owned by BKC "and is in breach of clauses XIIB.1 and
.2".
<P>

158   	The same basic allegations were made in respect of
Strathpine in Queensland, it being alleged that the Franchise Agreement
expired
on 30 November 1996; Booval/Ipswich in Queensland, it being alleged that the
Franchise Agreement expired on 30 June 1996;
Springwood in Queensland, it being
alleged that the Franchise Agreement expired on 13 December 1996; Balga in
Western Australia,
it being alleged that the Franchise Agreement expired on 16
December 1996; Barrack Street in Perth, it being alleged that the Franchise
Agreement expired on 1 February 1997; Beak House in Brisbane, it being alleged
that the Franchise Agreement expired on 21 December
1996; and Bunbury in
Western Australia, it being alleged that the Franchise Agreement expired on 20
December 1996.
<P>

159   	It was common ground that notwithstanding the purported
expiry of the Franchise Agreements, BKC continued to accept royalties
from HJPL
in respect of each of these restaurants, and that no Notices were given
pursuant to any of the Agreements into which the
parties had entered to cure
the alleged breaches.  Accordingly, in the view I take, a condition precedent
to the exercise of the
right to terminate had not been fulfilled.  The
situation had continued for periods ranging from approximately 15 months to
approximately
9 months before the Notice of Termination was given.  In my
opinion, the conduct of BKC amounted to a waiver of its right to terminate
for
these alleged breaches, or, alternatively, its conduct in allowing HJPL to
proceed to carry on the business with the expenses
and risk associated
therewith, whilst BKC derived the benefit of the royalties, constituted an
estoppel precluding BKC from relying
on such rights as it had.
<P>

160   	Mr Bathurst submitted that it was not open to BKC to make
these complaints since, throughout 1997, it was asserting that
the Development
Agreement was at an end and that HJPL had no rights and BKC had no obligations
under it; and that the breaches were
capable of cure, but no notice was given
under clause 15.2 for this to occur.  I shall leave aside the issue whether BKC
was entitled
to rely on the various extension agreements, which Mr Bathurst
submitted it could not.  The short answer to this point, in addition
to the
waiver argument, is that the breach on which Mr Oslington placed reliance was
"in continuing to trade using the trade marks
and trade secrets of BKC after
expiry of the Franchise Agreements".  Mr Oslington submitted that this breach
was not "a curable defect"
and relied on the submissions "as to why notice need
not be given in respect of trade mark breaches", and those about the furnishing
of confidential information to Messrs Hawryluk and Deugarde, which submissions
I do not accept.  He added that the damage to goodwill
arising from continued
trading in restaurants in need of renovation was not capable of cure, as the
System's reputation became tarnished.
 This point would seem, if factually
valid, to have required far more timely action by BKC than it received.
<P>

161   	The conclusion to which I have come makes it unnecessary,
for present purposes, to go through the lengthy evidence about
steps taken to
extend the Franchise Agreements and to renovate the restaurants.  These were
not the grounds on which this part of
the Notice to Terminate was based.
<P>

162   	The next complaint in the Notice was an unauthorised
"Coca Cola" distribution in alleged breach of clause 6.5 of the Development
Agreement, it being asserted that a Coca-Cola Show Bag was sold and distributed
to the public at the 1997 Sydney Royal Easter Show,
which contained a
coupon/flyer in relation to a sales promotion run by HJPL, which was not
authorised by BKC.  This was another "advertising"
situation, which must fail
for the reasons I have given.
<P>

163   	Nextly it was asserted that in breach of clause 10.5 of
the Development Agreement there was a sale of unauthorised products
in that in
or about March and April 1997 HJPL distributed, supplied and sold a certain
dessert, Fudge brownie, at some or all of
its restaurants in New South Wales,
which was not a BKC approved menu item, was not made from ingredients and in
accordance with
the procedures approved by BKC, and was not approved by it
before distribution, supply and sale.  A further breach alleged was that
HJPL
did not notify BKC in advance of the proposal to distribute, supply and sell
"the said non-BKC items".  There was no evidence
of any notice requiring HJPL
to cure the alleged breach.  In any event, Mr Oslington did not pursue this
point.
<P>

164   	Finally there was an allegation of failure to properly
use trademarks.  Clauses 10.6, 11.3 and 11.5 of the Development Agreement
were
quoted and it was asserted that on, 29 November 1993, BKC provided HJPL with a
document describing how trademarks were to be
advertised, and asserting that in
various ways HJPL failed to use trademarks properly, with the result that the
incorrect use of
them was:-
<P>

".. in violation of each of the individual Franchise Agreements between HJPL
and BKC.  Such actions are also a violation of clauses
10.6, 11.3 and 11.5 of
the Development Agreement."
<P>

In my opinion, the provisions of clause 6.5 and the requirement to give notice
to cure apply to these alleged breaches in the ways
to which I have
referred.
<P>

165   	The Notice then made reference to unauthorised promotions
and, after quoting clauses 6.5 and 11.5 of the Development Agreement,
it
referred to several particulars of breach by virtue of HJPL's failing to obtain
BKC's approval or authorisation for the promotional
activities.  In my opinion,
this is another "advertising" situation, which must fail for the reasons I have
given.
<P>

166   	Finally there was alleged to be a breach of the Franchise
Agreement in respect of the restaurant at Marion in Adelaide, in
that on 31
January 1997 HJPL voluntarily abandoned and ceased to operate the Marion
restaurant and had ceased to keep it open for
business for the prescribed times
without BKC's consent, such as to bring about a breach of clause VI.G of the
Franchise Agreement.
 The evidence, which I accept, was that HJPL was required
to close this restaurant because of the remodelling of the shopping centre
in
which it was situated.  BKC gave no notice requiring the curing of this alleged
breach.  In view of its subsequent refusal to
grant another franchise in
respect of that restaurant, it could hardly have given such a notice.
<P>

167   	Mr Oslington submitted that there was an obligation, in
these circumstances, to obtain the consent of BKC to close the restaurant.
There was no suggestion that HJPL had any control over the situation.  The
landlord forced the closure.  That was not, on a construction
of the agreement,
the type of closure to which it was referring.
<P>

168   	The Notice continued:-
<P>

"Termination
<P>

Accordingly, BKC, on the assumption, which it denies, that it has not validly
terminated the Development Agreement, without prejudice
to all of its rights
arising from BKC's termination of the Development Agreement on 18 November
1996, now hereby terminates the Development
Agreement pursuant to the
provisions of clause 15.1 of the Development Agreement."
<P>

169   	In my opinion, for the reasons I have given, even if it
was still open to BKC to terminate the Development Agreement as at
8 September
1997, the Notice of that date was not valid and effective to do so.
<P>

The First Issue Of Construction
<P>

170   	I shall deal with the potential tension between clauses
2.1 and 3.2 immediately.  In my opinion, the resolution is that clause
2.1 is
concerned with the obligation of HJPL to develop during the term of the
Development Agreement, a breach of which would entitle
BKC to exercise its
rights under that Agreement.  Clause 3.2 is concerned with the conditions,
which must be met by HJPL if it wishes
to exercise the right to renew given by
that clause.  On this basis each clause is dealing with different situations
and must be
considered accordingly, and in the light of all the other
contractual provisions touching on each situation.
<P>

The Construction Of The Termination Clause
<P>

171   	The next issue is whether the Development Agreement was,
as a matter of construction, terminated by the Shorter and Longer
Notices of
Termination or either of them.  I have, of necessity, referred to certain of
the issues and my conclusions, some of which
assumed answers to the
construction points favourable to HJPL.  I shall now seek to explain why I
considered those assumptions are
correct. The sub-issues are:-
<P>

(a)	Whether the breaches alleged were conditions, which entitled BKC to
terminate at law without recourse to the termination provisions
in the
Agreement.  Mr Bathurst submitted that they lacked sufficient essentiality to
satisfy that requirement.  Mr Oslington submitted
that that was not a necessary
part of his case because the termination provision was wide enough to cover
breaches not only of conditions,
but of other terms or provisions.  However, in
case a different view is taken elsewhere I propose to reach a conclusion on
this issue.
<P>

(b)	Whether, in relation to the Shorter Notice, the right to terminate was
governed by clause 15, as Mr Oslington submitted, or
whether, as Mr Bathurst
submitted, clause 8.1 governed the situation and, perhaps, clause 15 could only
operate once there had been
a failure to comply with clause 8.1. 
<P>

(c)	Whether, even if Mr Oslington was correct in relation to (b), the rights
under clause 15 could only be exercised after notice
was given requiring the
breach to be cured, notwithstanding that it was conceded that it could not be
cured within thirty days; i.e.
whether a breach was capable of being cured
within the meaning of the agreement, notwithstanding that it could not be cured
within
the time limited by clause 15.2 for it to be cured, thereby giving BKC
the right to terminate, that right flowing from the failure
to cure within the
stipulated time.
<P>

(d)	Whether, as Mr Bathurst submitted, the giving of a notice to cure, where
the breach was one capable of being cured albeit it
could not be cured within
the specified time, was a condition precedent to the right to give a notice to
terminate.
<P>

(e)	Whether, in relation to the Longer Notice, the alleged breaches were
capable of cure within the sense to which I have referred,
such that the giving
of a notice to cure was a condition precedent to the exercise of the right to
terminate.
<P>

This consideration proceeds on the basis that, as a matter of fact, there were
breaches and that BKC was not precluded by considerations
of waiver, estoppel
or implied terms of reasonableness or good faith from exercising its rights to
terminate, save in so far as I
have expressly made a finding on any such
matter.  Each of those matters was very much in dispute.
<P>

172   	Firstly, it is established that implied terms of
reasonableness and good faith mean that a clause allowing for termination
will
not necessarily be construed literally so as to allow that right to be
exercised in relation to a breach no matter how minor
nor susceptible of easy
rectification.  This is an important qualification having regard to Mr
Oslington's submission that the breaches
said to found the right to terminate
are not ones "capable of being cured", because once the breach has occurred it
can never be
rectified.  That submission, of necessity, denies operation to the
words "capable of being cured" in a vast number of instances.
 If that be so it
strengthens the view that, as a matter of construction also, the termination
clause should not operate on minimal
breaches, or ones which could, but for the
submission, be readily cured.  
<P>

173   	The approach of a Court to such a clause, as with most
clauses in commercial contracts, is that the parties intend to be
bound by,
rather than seek to avoid, their contract.  As Roskill LJ said in Cehane NV v
Bremer Handelsgesellschaft mbH  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%20QB%2044" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] QB 44</a> at p.71:-
<P>

"In principle contracts are made to be performed and not to be avoided
according to the whims of market fluctuation and where there
is a free choice
between two possible constructions (of a contract) I think the court should
prefer that construction which will
ensure performance and not encourage
avoidance of contractual obligations."
<P>

174   	To similar effect Gibbs J said, in Australian
Broadcasting Commission v Australian Performing Right Association Limited
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1973/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1973] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20129%20CLR%2099" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 129 CLR 99</a>, at p.109:-
<P>

"It is trite law that the primary duty of a court in construing a written
contract is to endeavour to discover the intention of
the parties from the
words of the instrument in which the contract is embodied.  Of course the whole
of the instrument has to be
considered, since the meaning of any one part of it
may be revealed by other parts, and the words of every clause must if possible
be construed so as to render them all harmonious one with another.  If the
words used are unambiguous the court must give effect
to them, notwithstanding
that the result may appear capricious or unreasonable, and notwithstanding that
it may be guessed or suspected
that the parties intended something different.
The court has no power to remake or amend a contract for the purpose of
avoiding a
result which is considered to be inconvenient or unjust.  On the
other hand, if the language is open to two constructions, that will
be
preferred which will avoid consequences which appear to be capricious,
unreasonable, inconvenient or unjust, `even though the
construction adopted is
not the most obvious, or the most grammatically accurate' ..."
<P>

This approach has been applied frequently.
<P>

175   	In Ankar Pty Limited v National Westminster Finance
(Australia) Limited  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20162%20CLR%20594" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 162 CLR 594</a>, at pp.556-557, Mason ACJ, Wilson,
Brennan and Dawson JJ said:-
<P>

"In deciding whether a promise has the status and effect of a condition, courts
are not too ready to construe a term as a condition
and, at least where other
considerations are finely balanced, will hold that a term is of such a kind
that breach of it does not
give rise to an automatic right to rescind.  This
approach is explained by a preference for a construction that will encourage
performance
rather than avoidance of contractual obligations: <i>Cehane NV v
Bremer mbH</i>; <i>Bunge Corporation</i>."
<P>

176   	In Hide &amp; Skin Trading Pty Limited v Oceanic Meat
Traders Limited  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2020%20NSWLR%20310" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 20 NSWLR 310</a> Kirby P considered a resolution of
ambiguity in commercial agreements and, at pp.313-314, said:-
<P>

"Whoever may be the parties to the agreement, it is the fundamental rule, that
a court should give the words of a written agreement
the natural meaning that
they bear.  Subject to that rule, in giving meaning to the words of an
agreement between commercial parties,
courts will endeavour to avoid a
construction which makes commercial nonsense or is shown to be commercially
inconvenient.  This
is because courts will infer that commercial parties would
not themselves normally agree in such a way."  
<P>

177   	Secondly, the question arises as to how the "curing"
provision should operate.  HJPL submitted that where a breach was capable
of
being cured the requisite notice had to be given and, thereafter, the specified
time had to expire without a curing of it, before
a notice to terminate could
be given.  BKC did not contest the first proposition.  It submitted that a
breach was not capable of
cure, either because a breach having occurred the
matter could never be put right for the future, or because it was not possible
to remedy the breach, within the time specified, and, therefore, the breach was
one incapable of being cured.  In either event, Mr
Oslington submitted, it was
not necessary to give notice.  I have also adverted to what I think may have
been submitted, that once
a breach has been cured it is no longer capable of
cure so that a Notice of Termination may be given.  If that submission was
made,
I reject it for the reasons I have stated.
<P>

178   	It was submitted that there was no requirement to give
notice where the temporal limitations had expired.  I have difficulty
with this
submission.  It seems to me that most obligations are governed by time
limitations or restrictions, which are either specified
by reference to a date
or an event.  Thus, it may be that it is necessary for an act to be performed
within a specified time or by
a specified date.  Accordingly, it was provided
that if money had not been paid, the payment being determined either by a
specified
time or date or by an event, HJPL had ten days within which to cure
the breach.  Any such curing of the breach must occur beyond
the period when
the payment should have been made and, therefore, after the breach.  If Mr
Oslington's submission is carried to its
ultimate conclusion the breach would
not be capable of being cured, notwithstanding that clause 15.2 obviously
contemplates that
it may be.  Similarly, so it seems to me, breaches may be
related to events.  Thus there may be an obligation to keep premises clean.
When the premises cease to be clean, such as to constitute a breach, there will
be, at that time, a breach.  On Mr Oslington's submission,
because the time for
keeping the premises clean has expired by allowing them to become dirty, the
breach cannot be cured.  However,
to apply that construction would be to remove
much of the effect of clause 15.2 and, in a vast majority of cases, to render
those
provisions of no effect.  That would, in my opinion, lead to a result the
Development Agreement never contemplated and would substantially
defeat its
purpose.  The authorities support the view that where the time has passed a
breach, which is capable of being cured, may
be cured for the future.
<P>

179   	Mr Bathurst responded that the purpose of clause 15.2 was
to govern when breaches may give rise to the right to terminate.
 Firstly, if a
breach was "capable of being cured", i.e. able to be put right for the future,
the existence of that fact necessitated
the giving of notice to cure.  It
mattered not that the breach could not be cured within the specified number of
days because the
clause was directed to breaches "capable of being cured", not
"breaches capable of being cured within 10 or 30 days".  Once it was
established that the breach was capable of being cured that gave rise to a
condition precedent to give notice prescribing either
10 or 30 days to do so.
If the breach was not cured in that period, the right to terminate arose by
virtue of that failure.  Secondly,
the fact that there had been a breach, which
was capable of being cured for the future, could not give rise to a right to
terminate
without notice on the basis that the past breach could never be put
right.  Such a construction would deny the clause of much of
its operation, and
would be completely opposed to its obvious purpose and intent in the context in
which it was found.  
<P>

180   	In Batson v De Carvalho &amp; Ors (1948) 48 SR 417 the
plaintiff leased premises from the defendant.  He parted with possession
to
others in breach of a covenant in the lease, suggesting to them that they
should conceal from, or misrepresent to, the defendant
the terms of their
possession.  The defendant served a notice upon the plaintiff purporting to be
given in compliance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.129</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a> and later entered
into possession of  and re-let the premises to those to whom the plaintiff had
given possession.  The notice merely
recited the covenant alleged to have been
broken, and stated that the breach was incapable of remedy.  The plaintiff
commenced a
suit for relief against forfeiture and moved for an interlocutory
injunction restraining the defendant and the occupants from depriving
him of
possession.
<P>

181   	At p.424, Sugerman J began to consider a complaint made
by the plaintiff of the failure to specify the particular breach
as required by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.129(1).</a>  His Honour noted that the form provided by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.129(9)</a> was one
primarily designed for the case of a breach capable of remedy and, at p.425, he
said:-
<P>

"Where the breach is not remediable, so that there is no opportunity of giving
the particulars in the requirement to remedy (and
that is the assumption I have
made in discussing this point), then a notice `to a similar effect' should
state the 
<P>

particulars in some other way."
<P>

182   	He dealt with the failure to require the plaintiff to
remedy the breach and, at p.426, said:-
<P>

"I agree entirely with what was said on this subject by Morris J in <i>Egerton
v Esplanade Hotels London Limited</i>: `I think it is clear that the phrase
"remedy the breach" cannot mean, and was not intended to mean, that the breach
was to be wiped
out, for that clearly would be an impossibility.  That which
has taken place cannot be obliterated as an event or as a fact.  Counsel
for
the second defendants submitted that a useful way in which to approach the
phrase "remedy the breach" would be to consider whether
the consequences of the
breach were capable of remedy'."
<P>

The construction which Sugerman J and Morris J rejected was, essentially, that
for which Mr Oslington contended, as indeed he had
to, his client having chosen
not to give notice requiring any of the breaches to be cured, which approach
necessarily proceeded on
the basis that the breaches were not capable of
cure.
<P>

183   	Sugerman J continued:-
<P>

"It is not necessarily true that every breach of a covenant not to assign etc
without consent is capable of remedy.  For instance
the character of the
assignee etc, or the use to which he puts the premises, may produce
consequences making applicable the considerations
which led to the actual
decision in the two cases to which I have just referred."
<P>

184   	His Honour considered various methods by which a remedy
could be achieved and noted that the lessee was entitled to an "opportunity
of
complying with the requirements of the notice".  He recognised that it may not
be possible for that to happen and, at p.427, said:-
<P>

"To `remedy' a breach is not to perform the impossible task of wiping it out -
of producing the same condition of affairs as if
the breach had never occurred.
It is to set things right for the future, and that may be done even though they
have for some period
not been right, and even though that may have caused some
damage to the lessor (for which he is entitled to claim compensation under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.129(1)(c))</a> provided: <i>Rugby School (Governors) v Tannahill</i>, <u>that the
breach has not resulted in a detriment to the premises which cannot be removed
within a reasonable time</u>.  The physical analogy in the use of the word
`remedy' (and similar words, such as `cure', in other branches of the law) may
be referred
to, not as an argument but to illustrate what is meant.  A breach
may be remedied, I think, even though the time for doing the thing
under the
covenant may have passed, or the order of events stipulated for in the covenant
can no longer be observed; to hold otherwise
would be to deprive <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.129(1)(b)</a> of
a great deal, if not all, of its operation.
<P>

For these reasons I come to the conclusion that the notice was also defective
in that the breach was `capable of remedy', if not
in any other way, then by
seeking the consent of the lessor, and the notice did not require the plaintiff
to remedy it."  (My emphasis.)
<P>

Mr Oslington placed heavy reliance on the words I have emphasised and the
authorities on which they were based.  A principal submission
was that conduct
on the part of HJPL was not capable of being cured if the effect of it was to
besmirch the products or name of BKC,
or BKC through HJPL.
<P>

185   	This decision was followed by the majority of the Court
of Appeal, Samuels JA and Waddell AJA, in<i> </i>Tricontinental Corporation
Limited v HDFI Limited  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2021%20NSWLR%20689" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 21 NSWLR 689.</a>  The agreement there in question
allowed the appellant, in a contractually specified time, to demand repayment
by the respondent
if an event of default, which was not capable of
rectification, had occurred, or if an event of default, which was capable of
rectification,
had occurred and remained unrectified at the expiration of seven
days after the date of a written notice requiring rectification.
<P>

186   	Waddell AJA, with whom Samuels JA essentially agreed,
said, p.718, that the clear commercial purpose of the provisions was
to provide
a mechanism whereby the liability on the part of the respondent could be
established in a way which was unambiguous and
certain, and that it was
essential in commercial dealings that such provisions be applied strictly "so
that parties know exactly
where they stand".  His Honour considered that was
sufficient to dispose of the appeal, but he dealt with certain other
submissions
and, at pp.722-723, noted a submission by the appellant that it was
entitled to rely upon the agreement in that the failure to pay
on a particular
date:-
<P>

".. is not a default which is capable of rectification because the date has
passed and nothing can be done to re-establish what
should have been done.  On
this view, only a continuing default could be regarded as capable of
rectification.  However, in my opinion,
the default in failing to pay the bills
due on 30 November was capable of rectification by paying the money due,
together with additional
interest as provided by the facility agreement, at a
future date."
<P>

187   	His Honour adopted the reasoning in Batson and quoted the
passage from p.427.
<P>

188   	Samuels JA said, p.702, that it was arguable that the
event of default was one that could not be rectified because the precise
time
for making the payment had passed "and could therefore not be retrieved".  His
Honour referred to the remarks of Lord Wilberforce
in Bunge Corporation, New
York v Tradax Export SA Panama <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] UKHL 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20WLR%20711" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 WLR 711</a>, in relation to breach of time
clauses; but then referred to Ankar at p.562.  He said:-
<P>

"If that is the case, then there would be no need to go beyond clause 2.2.1(a).
In his judgment Waddell AJA has set out a passage
from the judgment of Sugerman
J in <i>Batson</i> .. concerning the construction of the words `capable of
remedy' in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.129(1)(b)</a> ..   I agree with Waddell AJA that an analogous approach
should be taken to the construction of clauses 2.2.1.  If that is the case,
then one fixes upon the effect of the default in the given circumstances rather
than upon the historical fact of its occurrence."
<P>

He was of the view that the default was that the appellant did not receive its
money, but if the respondent was given an opportunity
to remedy it:_
<P>

".. it is possible that it could so arrange its affairs as to enable it to pay
up.  Hence it might be said that in this sense the
event of default was capable
of remedy."
<P>

189   	It may be said that the reasons of the majority were
<i>obiter dicta</i> in Tricontinental.  However, even if that be the correct
analysis, they are, if I may say so with respect, most powerful observations
and they adopt the reasoning of Sugerman J, which clearly provided part of the
<i>ratio decidendi</i> in Batson.  Also, once again if I may say so with great
respect, I find the reasoning totally compelling.
<P>

190   	A somewhat similar situation was considered by the House
of Lords in F.L. Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Limited
<a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1973/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1973] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20AC%20235" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] AC 235</a>,
in which a condition requiring the inspection of premises was imposed by clause
7.  Clause 11 provided that the agreement could
be terminated in, inter alia,
the following circumstances:-
<P>

"The other shall have committed a material breach of its obligations hereunder
and shall have failed to remedy the same within sixty
days of being required so
to do ..."
<P>

The question which arose was whether the breach of a condition meant that it
was not necessary to rely upon clause 11, Wickman contending
that Schuler was
only entitled to determine the agreement for the reasons and in the manner
provided in clause 11.  Schuler, on the
other hand, submitted that the terms of
clause 7 were decisive in its favour, and that as there was a breach of a
condition resort
to clause 11 was unnecessary.
<P>

191   	At pp.249-250 Lord Reid said:-
<P>

"But on any view the interrelation and consequences of the various provisions
of this agreement are so ill-thought out that I am
not disposed to discard the
natural meaning of the words which I have quoted merely because giving to them
their natural meaning
implies that the draftsman has forgotten something which
a better draftsman would have remembered.  If the terms of clause 11 are
wide
enough to apply to breaches of clause 7 then I am inclined to hold that clause
7 must be read subject to the provisions of clause
11.
<P>

It appears to me that clause 11(a)(i) is intended to apply to all material
breaches of the agreement which are capable of being
remedied.  The question
then is what is meant in this context by the word `remedy'.  It could mean
obviate or nullify the effect
of a breach so that any damage already done is in
some way made good.  <u>Or it could mean cure so that matters are put right for
the future.  I think that the latter is the more natural meaning</u>.  The word
is commonly used in connection with diseases or ailments and they would
normally be said to be remedied if they were cured
although no cure can remove
the past effect or result of the disease before the cure took place.  And in
general it can only be in
a rare case that any remedy of something that has
gone wrong in the performance of a continuing positive obligation will, in
addition
to putting it right for the future, remove or nullify damage already
incurred before the remedy was applied.  To restrict the meaning
of remedy to
cases where all damage past and future can be put right would leave hardly any
scope at all for this clause.  On the
other hand, there are cases where it
would seem a misuse of language to say that a breach can be remedied.  For
example, a breach
of clause 14 by disclosure of confidential information could
not be said to be remedied by a promise not to do it again."  (My emphasis.)
<P>

192   	At p.271 Lord Kilbrandon said:-
<P>

"On the whole, though without a great deal of confidence, I come to the
conclusion that the use of the word `condition' in 7(b)
was intended by the
parties to isolate an individual fundamental term, and to provide for
rescission, on any breach, in addition
to the other more general provisions for
rescission set out in clause 11, without the opportunity being given to the
party at fault
by clause 11 to put things right for the future, where the
nature of the breach made that possible.  Thus, when the appellants first
had
reason to complain in January 1963 of material breaches of clause 7(b), they
could have called upon the respondents to make better
arrangements within sixty
days, upon pain of rescission.  It is only in this way that I can give any
meaning to the remedial provision."
<P>

193   	As Dr J.W. Carter said in his article "Termination
Clauses" Vol 3 Journal of Contract Law (1990-1991) 90 at p.95:-
<P>

"Finally, the clause may go beyond a simple requirement of notice and specify a
particular process to be followed prior to termination.
 It is here difficult
to make generalisations, but the two main possibilities are as follows:-
<P>

1.	The promisee may be empowered to call upon the promisor to perform, by
providing an opportunity to `remedy' the breach; or
<P>

.......
<P>

In the first case, if the promisor performs the obligation breached after being
required to do so, the breach ceases to be available
as a source of
termination."
<P>

The Submissions On Construction Issues
<P>

194   	Mr Bathurst submitted that, as a matter of construction
of the Development Agreement, BKC did not have the right to terminate
it on 18
November 1996, as the Shorter Notice purported to do, for failure to build four
restaurants in the preceding year.  HJPL's
case was, firstly, that the rights
conferred on BKC, in the event of non-compliance with the Development Schedule,
were governed
"in their entirety" by clauses 3.2, 7.3 and 8.1 and, as a matter
of construction, a failure to comply with the Development Schedule
was neither
a breach of an essential term, such as to give rise to a right to rescind at
common law, nor did it give rise to a right
to terminate pursuant to clause 15.
Secondly, if there is any right to terminate it could only be effected by the
use of the mechanism
specified in clause 15 and, as the breach was capable of
being cured, the notice provisions requiring that to occur applied irrespective
of whether HJPL would have been able to achieve a cure within the thirty day
period; it being accepted by HJPL that it would not
have been able to do so.
<P>

195   	Mr Bathurst submitted that as to the Longer Notice and
the Notice given in September 1997, BKC was not entitled, on a proper
construction of the Development Agreement, to terminate for any of the breaches
referred to therein without giving a Notice of Default
required by clause 15.2,
such submissions being made on the assumption that the various breaches were
capable of giving rise to a
right to terminate if such a notice was given.  I
have concluded that this submission is correct.
<P>

196   	Mr Bathurst developed his submission in relation to the
Development Schedule thus.  He submitted that clause 2.1 is not an
essential
term of that agreement, is not described in it as a condition, and does not
provide that the time limitation is an essential
term.  Whilst he conceded
those matters were "by no means conclusive", he said they assumed some
significance over and above what
they usually assumed by dint of the
surrounding factual circumstances but, in any event, constituted "the first
pointer" to the term
not being regarded as essential.
<P>

197   	He submitted that an essential or fundamental term is one
in respect of which it can be said that BKC would not have entered
into the
contract had it not been assured of strict or substantial performance of it.
<P>

198   	In Tramways Advertising Pty Limited v Luna Park (NSW)
Limited (1938) 38 SR 632 Jordan CJ, at p.640, said that in considering
the
legal consequences flowing from a breach of contract, it is necessary to
determine the nature of the promise broken, because
if it is a condition, which
his Honour described as "an essential promise", the innocent party, upon
becoming aware of the breach,
ordinarily has the right at his option either to
treat himself as discharged from the contract or to recover damages for its
loss,
or to keep the contract on foot and recover damages for the particular
breach.  On the other hand if it is a warranty that is breached,
which his
Honour described as a "non-essential promise", only the latter alternative is
available to the innocent party.  At pp.641-642
his Honour set forth the test
of essentiality, in terms adopted by the High Court in DTR Nominees Pty Limited
v Mona Homes Pty Limited
&amp; Anor <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1978/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20138%20CLR%20423" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 138 CLR 423</a> at p.431.  Jordan CJ
said:-
<P>

"The test of essentiality is whether it appears from the general nature of the
contract considered as a whole, or from some particular
term or terms, that the
promise is of such importance to the promisee that he would not have entered
into the contract unless he
had been assured of a strict or a substantial
performance of the promise, as the case may be, and that this ought to have
been apparent
to the promisor: ..  If the innocent party would not have entered
into the contract unless assured of a strict and literal performance
of the
promise, he may in general treat himself as discharged upon any breach of the
promise, however slight.  If he contracted in
reliance upon a substantial
performance of the promise, any substantial breach will ordinarily justify a
discharge.  In some cases
it is expressly provided that a particular promise is
essential to the contract, eg. by a stipulation that it is the basis or of
the
essence of the contract: <i>Bettini v Gye</i>; but in the absence of express
provision the question is one of construction for the Court, when once the
terms of contract have
been ascertained; <i>Bentsen v Taylor Sons &amp; Co (No
2)</i>; <i>Clifton v Coffey</i>."
<P>

199   	In Bentsen v Taylor Sons &amp; Co (No 2)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1893%5d%202%20QB%20274" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1893] 2 QB 274</a>,
Bowen LJ said, at p.281:-
<P>

"Of course if it is often very difficult to decide as a matter of construction
whether a representation which contains a promise,
and which can only be
explained on the ground that it is in itself a substantive part of the
contract, amounts to a condition precedent,
or is only a warranty.  There is no
way of deciding that question except by looking at the contract in the light of
the surrounding
circumstances, and then making up one's mind whether the
intention of the parties, as gathered from the instrument itself, will best
be
carried out by treating the promise as a warranty sounding only in damages, or
as a condition precedent by the failure to perform
which the other party is
relieved of his liability.  In order to decide this question of construction,
one of the first things you
would look to is, to what extent the accuracy of
the statement - the truth of what is provided - would be likely to affect the
substance
and foundation of the adventure which the contract is intended to
carry out.  In the case of a charter party it may well be that
such a test
could only be applied after getting the jury to say what the effect of a breach
of such a condition would be on the substance
and foundation of the adventure;
not the effect of the breach which has in fact taken place, but the effect
likely to be produced
on the foundation of the adventure by any such breach of
that portion of the contract."
<P>

200   	In DTR Nominees Stephen, Mason and Jacobs JJ said, at
pp.430-431:-
<P>

"Whether a term of a contract is essential or not is a question of construction
which is to be answered with due regard to the general
nature of the contract
considered as a whole and to its particular terms."
<P>

After citing the passage from the judgment of Jordan CJ to which I have
referred, their Honours continued:-
<P>

"This statement of the law, which was approved in <i>Associated Newspapers
Limited v Bancks</i>, emphasises that the quality of essentiality depends for
its existence on a judgment which is made of the general nature of the contract
and its particular provisions, a judgment which takes close account of the
importance which the parties have attached to the provision
as evidenced by the
contract itself as applied to the surrounding circumstances.  Once this is
understood, there is no sufficient
foundation for holding that the respondents
would not have entered into the contract had they known that the appellant had
not lodged
the contract plan of subdivision and that it would not proceed
expeditiously thereafter."
<P>

201   	Aicken J agreed in that judgment.   Murphy J, who
dissented, considered that the "test" stated by Jordan CJ was so vague
that it
could not be described as a test, and that it diverted attention from the real
question:-
<P>

".. which is whether the non-performance means substantial failure to perform
the contractual obligations.  The inquiry into the
motivation for entry into
the contract is not the real point."  (Page 436.)
<P>

202   	Mr Bathurst submitted that the requirement that HJPL, or
any BKC franchisee introduced by it to BKC, should develop and open
a minimum
of four new Burger King restaurants each year commencing on 12 November 1990 in
the States of Western Australia, South
Australia and Queensland was not, when
one had regard to the test propounded by Jordan CJ, a promise of such
importance to BKC that
it would not have entered into the contract if it had
not been assured of a strict or substantial performance of it.
<P>

203   	The Development Agreement was for a term of five years,
(clause 3.1), with the result that if the Development Schedule was
maintained
at least twenty new restaurants would be opened over the term.
<P>

204   	Clause 2.2 provided for circumstances of a <i>force
majeure </i>nature whereby BKC may, after an independent examination of the
underlying facts, "not unreasonably withhold its consent to a reasonable
extension of time to meet the Development Schedule".  Mr Oslington agreed that
if BKC did exercise that power or right and the restaurants
were built within
the extended time there would be compliance with clause 2.1.
<P>

205   	Mr Bathurst submitted that clauses 3.2 and 8.1 made clear
that clause 2.1 lacked the element of essentiality to which Jordan
CJ referred.
Whilst it is clear that clause 3.2, which provided for renewal of the
Development Agreement, is dealing with a separate
matter, it is equally clear
that that right was dependent upon HJPL's having opened twenty restaurants
during the previous five years
in Western Australia, South Australia and
Queensland, which obligation would be fulfilled if a minimum of two
restaurants, rather
than four specified in clause 2.1, were opened each year.
I pause to note that neither party made a submission that the obligation
imposed by clause 3.2 was different from that imposed by clause 2.1 in the
sense that in clause 3.2 the obligation was on HJPL to
open twenty restaurants,
whereas in clause 2.1 the obligation was upon it or any BKC franchisee
introduced by it to BKC to develop
and open restaurants.  The parties, as I
understand it, accepted that there was no distinction between those two
formulations.
<P>

206   	The point made by Mr Bathurst was that the basic
requirement of clause 2.1 was the development and opening of a minimum of
four
new restaurants each year and, therefore, the opening of at least twenty new
restaurants over five years.  The question was,
conformably with Jordan CJ's
test, whether BKC would have entered into the contract unless it had been
assured of a strict or substantial
performance of that promise.  At the risk of
repetition, the promise was to build a minimum of four new restaurants each
year.  When
the promise was so understood, he submitted, the terms of clause
3.2 made it clear that this was not an essential term because the
important
provision allowing HJPL to renew the agreement, whilst requiring the opening of
twenty new restaurants over the five year
term of the agreement, provided for a
minimum of two restaurants each year.
<P>

207   	Under the Development Schedule HJPL was not restricted to
opening four new restaurants each year, that being the minimum.
 Accordingly,
it may open, for example, a greater number in any given year, but retain the
right to renew the Development Agreement
provided that over the five years it
opened twenty with a minimum of two each year.  Thus, Mr Bathurst submitted,
there was no requirement
of a strict or substantial performance with the
promise to open a minimum of four restaurants each year, because clause 3.2
provided
that the opening of half that number would be sufficient for its
purposes.
<P>

208   	He submitted, nextly, that clause 8.1 emphasised this
lack of essentiality.  The clause was the subject of much debate and
is worthy
of some further consideration.  The first sentence means that franchise fees
otherwise payable by HJPL would be waived
in any year commencing on 12 November
so long as HJPL adhered to the Development Schedule in that year, i.e. so long
as HJPL built
a minimum of four restaurants.  The second sentence is predicated
on a failure by HJPL to meet the requirements of the Development
Schedule, and
imposes on HJPL a liability to pay the franchise fee in respect of each
restaurant required to be but not opened under
the Development Schedule.
Accordingly, so Mr Bathurst submitted, the parties had agreed that the
consequence of failing to meet the
Development Schedule would sound in a
monetary payment by HJPL to BKC of an amount, the payment of which otherwise
would have been
waived.  However, the third sentence qualifies the second by
providing that the franchise fees, which become payable pursuant to
the second
sentence, are not payable until the end of the year following the failure and,
only then, if the failure has not been
made good by that time.
<P>

209   	The submission ran that if one assumes that as at 18
November 1996 there had been a failure to comply with the Development
Schedule,
the consequence of that was to require HJPL to pay the franchise fee in respect
of so many of the four restaurants as were
not opened during the year ending in
November 1996, but that such fees would not be payable until November 1997,
and, only then,
if the failure had not been made good.  Mr Bathurst submitted
that the consequence of this clause was, firstly, to allow HJPL a period
of
twelve months to make good the failure to develop in accordance with the
Development Schedule in the previous year, which made
it as clear as could be
that there was no relevant essentiality in building a minimum of four
restaurants each year, i.e. that looking
at the matter objectively, clause 8.1,
read in the context of the Development Agreement, showed that BKC did not enter
into that
agreement on the basis that there would be strict compliance with
clause 2.1.
<P>

210   	He submitted that those propositions were supported by
two further matters "of somewhat less significance, but equally relevant
in
this particular case".  Firstly, he referred to clause 2.2, which he said was a
pointer, although not as strong as the others,
to the fact that clause 2.1 is
not an essential term.  Secondly, he referred to clause 4.1 and submitted that
as HJPL must have,
in BKC's sole discretion, operational, financial and legal
approval to develop, that tended against the conclusion that clause 2.1
is an
essential term in the sense that, if there was not strict compliance, a right
to terminate would immediately arise at law.
 The submission, as I understand
it, was that clause 2.1 loses any relevant essentiality when HJPL may be
desirous of expanding but
is prevented from doing so in BKC's sole discretion.
Put another way, by retaining to itself the sole discretion to refuse
expansion,
BKC could not be heard to say that it was essential from its point
of view that there should be strict or substantial performance
with the
promise. I do not consider that this submission is correct.  Rather, in my
opinion, clause 4.1 enables BKC to refuse expansion
where HJPL has not met the
requirements for the approvals referred to in that clause.  I do not consider
that that points to the
lack of essentiality, if it otherwise exists, of clause
2.1.  However, I do consider that in construing the Development Agreement
it is
proper to have regard to the possibility that development may not proceed
whilst operational, financial or legal approvals
are withheld.  I shall assume,
for present purposes, that they are withheld properly.  That would provide a
reason, viewed objectively,
why the parties would allow a longer period, as, in
my opinion, is provided by clause 8.1, to comply with the Development
Schedule.
<P>

211   	Mr Bathurst's submissions proceeded that if it be correct
to say that clause 2.1 is not an essential term, the right to terminate
would
only arise under clause 15 and, he further submitted, that even if clause 2.1
is an essential term, the right to terminate
can only be exercised pursuant to
clause 15, which provides that the occurrence of the events specified "shall
constitute good cause
for BKC, at its option and without prejudice to any other
rights or remedies provided for hereunder or by law or equity, to terminate"
the Development Agreement.  Mr Bathurst submitted that notwithstanding that
reservation of rights, clause 15, in terms, is expressed
to apply to all
breaches, and that regardless of the division of terms into essential,
non-essential and intermediate ones, the clause
15 procedure had to be
followed.  This submission received support from the terms of clause 15.1(d),
upon which Mr Oslington also
placed reliance, which provided:-
<P>

"Hungry Jack's fails to comply with any of the other terms, provisions or
conditions of this agreement, any Franchise Agreement,
or any other obligation
owed to BKC."
<P>

Thus it was said that clause 15 expressly embraced a failure to comply with,
inter alia, "conditions".  Mr Bathurst submitted that
this was consistent with
the approach taken by Lord Reid in Schuler.
<P>

212   	Clause 7 of the agreement there under consideration
provided that it was a condition of it that Wickman should send its
representatives
to visit six named firms at least once in every week to solicit
orders for the purposes of the agreement.  The agreement was to last
for a
period, which required Wickman under that condition to make a total of some
1,400 visits during its term.  Wickman failed in
its obligations.  The
agreement also contained a term allowing for termination if a party committed a
material breach of its obligations,
which it failed to remedy within sixty days
of being required in writing to do so.
<P>

213   	Wickman submitted that Schuler was only entitled to
determine the agreement as provided in clause 11.  Schuler contended
that
clause 7 constituted a condition, breach of which entitled it to terminate
irrespective of clause 11.  At p.249 Lord Reid considered
the terms of the
clauses and concluded that if the terms of clause 11 were sufficiently wide to
apply to breaches of clause 7 he
was inclined to hold that clause 7 must be
read subject to the provisions of clause 11.  I have quoted the relevant
passage from
his Lordship's speech at pp.249-250.
<P>

214   	Mr Bathurst submitted that his Lordship had construed the
contract as one in which the parties had provided the method whereby
the
agreement may be terminated and, had thereby, excluded other methods.  He
referred also to the speech of Lord Kilbrandon at p.271,
which I have set
forth.
<P>

215   	Mr Bathurst relied nextly upon the decision of the Full
Court of the Federal Court in Amann Aviation Pty Limited v Commonwealth
of
Australia <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1990/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] FCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2022%20FCR%20527" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 22 FCR 527.</a>  Although the matter went to the High Court, the
appeal did not involve this aspect.  In that case there was a termination
clause,
which provided:-
<P>

"Whenever and so often as the Contractor fails to carry out the Contract <u>or
comply with a condition of the Contract to the satisfaction of the
Secretary</u> then in either of these events the Secretary may, by notice in
writing, require the Contractor to show cause in writing to the satisfaction
of
the Secretary, why the Contract or any specified portion thereof should not be
cancelled.  If the Contractor fails to show cause
in writing, if so required,
the Secretary shall be entitled to treat the Contract or any specified portion
thereof as having been
cancelled and may declare the whole or any part of the
security lodged by the Contractor forfeited by the Commonwealth, and thereupon
the amount so declared to be forfeited shall become the property of the
Commonwealth absolutely."  (My emphasis.)
<P>

216   	At p.532 Davies J said that clause 2.24 eschewed the
distinction between a condition, being a term going to the essence of
the
contract and breach of which would justify rescission, and a warranty, breach
of which would give rise only to a claim for damages.
 He considered, that to
that extent, clause 2.24 reflected the view expressed in Hong Kong Fir Shipping
Co Limited v Kawasaki Kisen
Kaisha Limited <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1961/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1961] EWCA Civ 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1962%5d%202%20QB%2026" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1962] 2 QB 26</a> and Ankar Pty Limited
v National Westminster Finance (Australia) Limited that the right to rescind
can depend upon the extent and
gravity of the breach upon which reliance was
placed, rather than on its classification as essential or non-essential.
<P>

217   	His Honour, after quoting and referring to certain
passages in those cases, concluded that clause 2.24, whilst not dealing
with a
case of repudiation by the contractor, none-the-less provided the agreed
procedure for cancellation on breach and that, accordingly,
the Commonwealth
was not entitled, of its own motion, outside the agreed procedure to specify
that a term was of the essence and
to rescind forthwith for the breach of that
term: p.532.
<P>

218   	At p.542 Sheppard J posed the question as being whether
the parties intended that the operation of clause 2.24 should be
limited to
cases in which the common law would treat the breach relied upon as
fundamental, or to ones where it would treat the breach
as being an
intermediate term.  His Honour continued:-
<P>

"The strength of the view that the clause was intended to be restricted in this
way arises from the serious consequences which may
flow if the power is
exercised and the fact that the contractor, for quite a minor breach, might
lose the benefit of the whole contract.
 Coupled with this consideration is the
circumstance that the contract provides in a number of places for liquidated
damages which
are to be paid in the event of particular breaches which are of a
comparatively inconsequential nature.
<P>

To be measured against these considerations is, in my respectful opinion, the
improbability that the parties intended that, in the
course of the
administration of a complex contract which was to be carried on over a number
of years, either party was to be put
in a position where a judgment had to be
made, often of some nicety, whether a breach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s3</a> of the contract was, or was
not, of a particular quality."
<P>

219   	Mr Bathurst submitted that the Development Agreement
dealt firstly with events of default as a matter of total generality,
(clause
15.1(d)); that it treated as events of default under the Development Agreement,
events which did not specifically arise under
it, but arose under the various
associated agreements, including the many Franchise Agreements; and that it
would be surprising in
those circumstances that the parties, having laid out
the clause 15 regime, only intended to apply it to a limited class of breach.
He continued:-
<P>

"It follows from that that, even if we are incorrect in saying that clause 2.1
should not be classified as an essential term, the
only mechanism for
termination as a consequence of default was the clause 15 mechanism, and if the
clause 15 mechanism doesn't apply,
then there is no right to terminate for
breach at all.
<P>

What we submit is this, that the regime in clause 15.1 is inherently
inconsistent with clause 3.2 and 8.1, and the only way those
provisions can be
read together is by limiting clause 15.1(d) so as not to apply to
non-compliance with the Development Schedule,
or, to put it another way,
non-compliance with the Development Schedule, whilst it confers certain rights
on the defendant for the
purpose of clauses 3.2, 7.3 and 8.1, is not a failure
to comply with the terms of the agreement for the purpose of clause 15.1(d)":
Tp.3714.
<P>

220   	The reliance on clause 7.3 stemmed from the rights it
furnished provided there was compliance with the Development Schedule.
 I have
quoted it.
<P>

221   	The submission was that clause 15.1(d) did not apply to a
breach of clause 2.1, which clause should be read as a statement
of the manner
in which it was envisaged development would occur and as a necessary
pre-condition to a continuation of the protection
against encroachment in
Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland given by clause 7.3, and as
ultimately triggering a liability
to pay a franchise fee under clause 8.1.
<P>

222   	Mr Bathurst submitted that clauses 2.1 and 3.2 could not
be read together, because if BKC was entitled to exercise an immediate
right of
termination for a failure to build a minimum of four restaurants in any one
year, a situation could arise where BKC could
terminate in circumstances where
HJPL had not lost its rights to a renewed term e.g. if during the first four
years of the agreement
HJPL constructed eighteen restaurants, compliance with
clause 3.2 could be achieved by building two restaurants, the minimum number
required by that clause, in the final year.
<P>

223   	Mr Bathurst submitted that it was necessary to give
effect to all the provisions of the contract, so far as possible.  Therefore,
he submitted that in certain circumstances HJPL may be in breach of clause 2.1,
but not in breach of clause 3.2 and, if there was
a right to terminate either
for breach of an essential term or pursuant to clause 15, the accrued rights
under clause 3.2 to renew
the agreement could be defeated.  The effect of the
submission was that there were two rights travelling, in effect, in parallel,
and that provided there was compliance with, for example, the requirements of
clause 3.2, it could not have been the intention of
the parties to defeat the
rights accrued under that clause by reliance upon a breach of clause 2.1.  In
those circumstances, so the
submission ran, the breach of clause 2.1 was
accommodated by other remedies in the Development Agreement.  I have referred
to the
remedy provided by clause 8.1, which, at least prima facie, is at odds
with a termination pursuant either to a common law right based
on the essential
nature of clause 2.1, or pursuant to clause 15.  Mr Bathurst relied also upon
clause 7.3, which he said provided
a further sanction for breach of clause 2.1,
namely that if HJPL did not comply with clause 2.1 it would lose the rights
conferred
by clause 7.3.  It is also relevant to note in this regard that the
Development Agreement conferred on HJPL a non-exclusive right.
 There was
nothing to prevent BKC expanding in the States of Western Australia, South
Australia and Queensland, if it thought development
was appropriate there and,
for an abundance of caution, clause 7.3 made that clear.  The only possible
restriction on BKC in those
States was that provided by that clause subject to
HJPL's compliance with the Development Schedule.  It was submitted that this
was
another pointer to the non-essentiality of the Development Schedule in that
there was nothing to prevent BKC's opening the necessary
number of restaurants
or, to put it another way, BKC had not contracted away its rights to develop in
those States and thus to meet
any perceived need in them and, further, if HJPL
was not complying with the Development Schedule, BKC's rights in this regard
were
unrestricted.  Accordingly, Mr Bathurst submitted, viewed objectively the
parties must be taken to have considered that to be an
adequate solution to the
failure by HJPL to comply with clause 2.1.
<P>

224   	In relation to clause 8.1 Mr Bathurst submitted that it
provided, as clearly as may be, that the Development Agreement would
continue
on foot so as to give HJPL the opportunity to achieve the necessary number of
restaurants, and that, accordingly, there
could not be a right to rescind for
breach of an essential term or pursuant to clause 15, which would deprive HJPL
of that right.
 In these circumstances his submissions were that it must follow
that, viewed objectively, the parties' intention was not to confer
a right to
terminate, either at law or under the provisions of clause 15.1(d), because
such a right was not necessary to enable BKC
to expand its development
activities, which was the primary concern of the Development Agreement.  Of
course fundamental to these
submissions was that the period to cure under
clause 8.1 could not be reconciled with the thirty day period to cure under
clause
15.2.
<P>

225   	Another point made was that whilst in some instances it
may be possible to comply with clause 2.1 within a period of thirty
days if,
for example, only relatively minor matters had to be done to enable restaurants
to be opened, in many cases the development
of a new restaurant would take far
longer than thirty days and, accordingly, the proper way in which to construe
the Development
Agreement was on the basis that the parties recognised this
and, therefore, allowed the further period of twelve months in which
to comply.
I should also add that Mr Bathurst did not suggest that this submission
precluded termination for repudiatory conduct
on the part of HJPL, but there
was no submission that HJPL had engaged in any such conduct.
<P>

226   	Mr Oslington commenced his submissions by referring to
the fact that the parties were entitled to include in their contract
what they
wished, and that the Court's duty is to give effect to those wishes, as
expressed in the contract and construed objectively.
 Both those submissions
are correct, the first giving rise to what the parties have stated in the
contract, as a matter of construction,
and the second to how, having regard to
accepted canons of construction, including the implication of terms, the words
used should
be interpreted.  He noted that HJPL had not alleged the existence
of any implied terms relevantly for the purposes of the initial
submissions,
and the terms of clause 19.1.  He submitted that the Court was required to give
the Development Agreement its "fair
meaning", conformably with that clause.
<P>

227   	Mr Oslington then pointed to clause 20, which provided
that the Development Agreement is an entire agreement superseding
all prior
negotiations, understandings and written or oral agreements.  Nextly, he
submitted that Mr Bathurst had not pointed to
any clause of the Development
Agreement which, in his submission, was ambiguous, but rather sought to use
rules of construction of
contracts for resolving an ambiguity in an attempt to
achieve a construction of the Development Agreement, which accommodated HJPL
in
the circumstances.
<P>

228   	Mr Oslington submitted, Tp.3761, that clause 2.1
constituted a condition, but that it was unnecessary for me to consider
that
because that question would only arise in the absence of express provision for
termination for the particular breach, and that
clause 15.1(d) entitled BKC to
terminate for the breach, inter alia, of any condition; that it was expressed
in the widest term;
and that for the issue as to whether clause 2.1 imposed a
condition to arise, it would be necessary for me to read the very wide
language
in clause 15.1(d) as demonstrating a contractual intent to allow termination on
that ground for only some of the terms,
provisions and conditions "an
interpretation, which, in our submission, is contrary to a fair reading of the
language used in clause
15.1(d)".
<P>

229   	Therefore, Mr Oslington's primary submission was that it
mattered not whether clause 2.1 was a condition, because it was
a term or
provision of the Development Agreement, and, accordingly, capable of being
terminated pursuant to clause 15 in reliance
upon clause 15.1(d).  This removed
the need to consider Mr Bathurst's submission that the Development Agreement
could not be terminated
for breach of a condition without recourse to the
provisions providing for termination, although Mr Oslington continued that if
HJPL's
submission was correct that it must be demonstrated that clause 2.1 was
a condition, the relevant test of essentiality had been established.
 In this
regard he pointed to the fact that the agreement was called "a Development
Agreement"; that HJPL derived rights to develop
and obtained the benefit of
development; that the benefit of that development was the opening of a minimum
of four restaurants in
the three States each year and a non-exclusive right to
develop throughout Australia, subject to limited exceptions; and that
development
could be restrained in Western Australia, South Australia and
Queensland pursuant to clause 7.3.  The right to develop involved the
derivation of income.  On the other hand, he submitted the principal benefit
given to BKC was the entitlement to have four restaurants
built each year, and
that these various matters were encapsulated in Recital F, which provided:-
<P>

"Various difficulties having arisen between BKC and Hungry Jack's and having
been resolved by agreement between them, BKC and Hungry
Jack's now wish to make
further provision for the development of Burger King restaurants in Australia,
to replace the provisions
of the agreement of 1 June 1986."
<P>

230   	Mr Oslington pointed out that clause 1.1, which provided
the grant of the non-exclusive right to develop, was "subject to
the full
satisfaction of the terms and conditions of this Agreement", one of those terms
and conditions being the obligation to develop
as specified in clause 2.1.
Therefore, it was submitted that a failure to comply with clause 2.1 meant that
the right to develop
further could be denied by BKC's electing to refuse
further development without taking the next step of terminating the Development
Agreement.  This submission depends upon the correct construction of the
agreement, i.e. an understanding of the agreement to determine
what is
necessary to achieve "full satisfaction".
<P>

231   	Mr Oslington submitted nextly that clause 7.3 is also
subject to a condition precedent, namely HJPL's compliance with the
Development
Schedule.  Once again this submission proceeded on the basis that the failure
to develop the minimum number of restaurants
provided for in clause 2.1,
without more, meant that there was not compliance with the agreement.  That
this is what the submission
meant is made clear by Mr Oslington's contention
that clause 2.1 was quite specific in requiring the opening of a minimum of
four
new BKC restaurants each year, the importance in meeting that requirement
being underlined by the limited circumstances in which
the parties agreed that
any extension of time would be given, pursuant to clause 2.2, for doing so.
<P>

232   	He referred to the requirements of clause 4.1 and he
concluded that those various provisions demonstrated the importance
of the
promise to comply with the Development Schedule, and a full satisfaction of the
terms and conditions of the Development Agreement
before development could take
place.
<P>

233   	Mr Oslington submitted that clause 2.1 contained a time
stipulation and referred to the authorities that such a stipulation,
viewed
objectively, were ordinarily construed as conditions.  He submitted that once
there was a breach of clause 2.1 the principal,
or perhaps whole, object of the
Development Agreement from BKC's point of view was thwarted, and he relied upon
clause 2.1 being
regarded as a condition because, in the case of its breach, it
may be difficult to obtain an adequate remedy by way of damages. 
He referred
to various ways in which this could occur.
<P>

234   	At Tp.3770, Mr Oslington said that if it was necessary to
find whether clause 2.1 is a condition in the strict sense "contrary
to our
submission", I should find that it was and that upon BKC's becoming aware of
breach of the condition, it was entitled to elect
whether to terminate or to
leave the Development Agreement on foot with such rights as BKC had if it did
so.  He said one of those
rights was the right under clause 8.1.  However, if I
may say so with respect, it seems to me that clause 8.1 confers rights on both
BKC and HJPL.  The first sentence clearly confers rights on HJPL, although on
the hypothesis on which the matter is presently proceeding
it had lost them.
However, the loss was, arguably, only temporary, because whilst the second
sentence conferred a right on BKC to
payment, the third sentence conferred a
right on HJPL to avoid that payment and to make good the failure in the way
stated.
<P>

235   	Mr Oslington then commenced to consider clause 15.1 and
noted the generality of the words in sub-clause (d).  He submitted
that a fair
reading of that clause required the conclusion that the parties intended to
give BKC the right to terminate for breach
of any term of the Development
Agreement.  In this context he referred particularly to the decision of the
High Court in Shevill
v Builders' Licensing Board  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20149%20CLR%20627" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 149 CLR 627</a>, and
especially to the statements of Gibbs CJ at p.631.
<P>

236   	In addition Mr Oslington referred to the terms of the
Settlement Agreement, to which I have referred, including the "Matters
in
Dispute", and concluded that in the light of that agreement it was not
surprising that the Development Agreement, as part of the
regime of settlement,
provided for strict and full compliance with the terms of the Development
Agreement and expressly for termination
by BKC only.  The submission continued
that the events described in sub-clause (d) were not qualified by any other
provision of the
Development Agreement, so that there was no basis for reading
down the event covered by that sub-clause to "hive off some of the
terms,
provisions and conditions and say that those terms and conditions are not
covered".
<P>

237   	The position thus reached was that Mr Bathurst was
submitting that clause 2.1 was not an essential term of the Development
Agreement, such as to make it a condition breach of which entitled BKC to
terminate without recourse to the terms of clause 15. 
Mr Oslington's primary
submission was that BKC did not have to establish that clause 2.1 was a
condition as it was entitled to rely
on clause 15 by dint of clause 15.1(d).
However, if it was necessary for BKC to establish that clause 2.1 was a
condition then he
submitted that had been established.
<P>

238   	In my opinion, clause 2.1 has not been shown to be a
condition of the Development Agreement.  It was, undoubtedly, a provision
of
significance, but it was not one which, on a proper construction of the
agreement as a whole, contained an assurance of a strict
or substantial
performance of the promise without which BKC would not have entered into the
agreement.  I have come to that conclusion
for the following reasons.  Firstly,
whilst the Development Agreement was obviously concerned with development by
HJPL, HJPL was
not given the exclusive right to develop and if BKC came to the
view that development was not proceeding satisfactorily in Western
Australia,
South Australia and Victoria, it was able to remedy that by having others
develop, or by developing itself, in circumstances
where such development would
be unfettered by the terms of clause 7.3.  The situation may have been very
different if BKC had been
granted the exclusive right to develop in those
States, such that BKC was dependent upon HJPL's compliance with the Development
Schedule
to maintain a satisfactory presence in them.  
<P>

239   	Secondly, the lack of essentiality is pointed up by the
differing requirements under the Development Schedule and for obtaining
a
renewal of the agreement.  If BKC would not have entered into the agreement
unless it had been assured of the appropriate compliance
by HJPL, it is
difficult to see why BKC would agree to renew the agreement if there was a
lesser compliance.  Prima facie, if compliance
with clause 2.1 was essential so
far as BKC was concerned, one would have expected the renewal to be subject to
HJPL's compliance
with that clause.  Thirdly, the lack of relevant essentiality
also emerges from the terms of clause 8.1.  It is a little difficult,
at least
on this aspect, to say more than I have about that clause.  Suffice to add that
it is totally inconsistent with a submission
that it was essential to BKC to
have a minimum of four restaurants built in each year.
<P>

240   	In the result I am satisfied that clause 2.1 cannot be
treated as an essential term or as a condition of the Development
Agreement
and, accordingly, breach of it did not give rise at law to terminate.
Therefore, any termination must be made, as Mr Oslington
submitted, pursuant to
clause 15.
<P>

241   	The next question, which logically arises, is whether and
if so when, on a proper construction of the Development Agreement,
clause
15.1(d) can apply.  It is, as Mr Oslington submitted, wide in its terms.
However, it must be read with the whole agreement
and, therefore, accommodate
other provisions of it.  As I have noted Mr Bathurst submitted that upon a
proper construction of the
various clauses, clause 8.1 provided that there
could be no breach of the Development Schedule until the expiration of twelve
months
after the year in which there was a failure to develop the requisite
number of restaurants.  By a plain reading, or to adopt the
words of clause 19
a "fair reading", of clause 8.1, I think this must be correct.  Mr Oslington's
submission was that clause 8.1
did not fetter BKC's right to terminate under
clause 15 for a breach of clause 2.1, the only fetter on that right being the
requirement
to give notice under clause 15.2 if the breach was capable of
remedy.  He submitted clause 8.1 was not expressed to qualify, modify
or place
restrictions on the right of termination under clause 15, and that it did not
express any qualification or modification
on the obligation under clause 2.1 to
build four restaurants per annum.  He submitted that what clause 8.1 did was to
impose a penalty
on HJPL for failing to comply with clause 2.1, and allowed
HJPL to escape that penalty if it made up the shortfall in the following
year.
He continued that it is a clause only capable of operation if the Development
Agreement remained on foot, and that if it was
intended to qualify HJPL's
obligations under clause 2.1, one would expect that to be expressed.  He
continued that clause 2 was "self-contained"
and stated the circumstances in
which HJPL was entitled to any relief from compliance with its obligations to
build four restaurants
a year.
<P>

242   	That gave rise to the question as to why clause 8.1 did
not modify clause 2, which Mr Oslington answered by stating, firstly,
that it
was not expressed as doing so, and secondly, that it "simply imposes" a penalty
on HJPL for failing to comply with that schedule.
 He said the third sentence
allowed HJPL to avoid that penalty if it made up the shortfall "provided of
course that the agreement
has not been terminated", which submission flowed
from his submission that clause 8.1 must be premised on the continued existence
of the Development Agreement, although not in any way limiting BKC's rights to
terminate under clause 15.  It was Mr Oslington's
submission that clause 8.1
was designed to provide some remedy to BKC in circumstances in which it elected
not to terminate for breach
of clause 15.  There are, in my respectful opinion,
some difficulties with this submission.  Whilst the right to terminate arises
if there is a failure to comply with "any" of the terms, provisions or
conditions of the Development Agreement or, "any other obligation
owed to BKC",
those provisions must be read subject to any express provision in the
Development Agreement dealing with a particular
circumstance.
<P>

243   	I think it is correct to say that clause 8.1 does not
prevent BKC from terminating the agreement for breach of various terms
and
obligations owed by HJPL to BKC, provided the appropriate steps are taken.  If
that were to occur the agreement would be terminated
with such consequences as
flowed from that, which would include, arguably, the loss of rights under
clause 8.1.  However, the immediately
relevant question is whether a breach of
clause 2.1 allows BKC to avail itself of the general terminating power
contained in clause
15, in the light of clause 8.1, which is directed to the
specific situation of breach of clause 2.1.  In my opinion, it is not correct
to say that clause 8.1 does not modify or qualify clause 2.1.  I consider it
obviously does.  It provides what is to happen in the
event of a minimum of
four restaurants not being built each year.  The second sentence is predicated
upon "failure to adhere to the
Development Schedule", i.e. it is predicated on
breach of clause 2.1, and it states the consequences of any such breach.  If
the
third sentence were not present then there would be more force in Mr
Oslington's submission that all clause 8.1 was doing was providing
BKC with a
remedy if it elected not to terminate.  But, in my opinion, the third sentence
is of critical importance.  Firstly, it
predicates that the agreement will
remain on foot, notwithstanding the breach of clause 2.1, until the end of the
year following
the failure.  That is clear because at that point the franchise
fees are to be paid, but the obligation to make that payment is removed
if the
failure is made good by then.  Clause 8.1, accordingly, expands the time within
which there may be compliance with the Development
Schedule.  In my opinion, it
is only if the failure is not made good by the time specified that there is a
breach of clause 2.1.
 The contrary conclusion would deprive HJPL of the rights
it has been granted to remedy the failure to adhere to clause 2.1.  The
specific provisions of clause 8.1 are directed to this very point and, in so
far as one needs to find any commercial reason for that,
it is that the time
for expanding pursuant to clause 2.1 may well exceed the time allowed in clause
15.2, namely thirty days.  It
is also relevant to bear in mind that whilst HJPL
remains in breach of the Development Schedule it loses the rights under clause
7.3.
<P>

244   	As I have said, it may well be that if the Development
Agreement is terminated for some other breach the Development Schedule
and the
rights conferred by clause 8.1 fall with it.  Similarly, the right to renew
would fall.  However, where reliance is placed
by BKC upon a breach of clause
2.1, it is not open to BKC, in my opinion, upon a proper construction of the
agreement, to go straight
to clause 15.  HJPL retains the right to remedy the
breach during the twelve months specified in clause 8.1 and, until it has had
that time it is not in breach of the Development Agreement in circumstances
allowing BKC to seek to terminate it.  If that is not
so then a construction of
the agreement would have to be adopted, which would write out the words "but
not if such failure is made
good by that time".  There is no justification for
taking that approach and every justification, on all appropriate principles of
construction, for rejecting it.
<P>

245   	I am also of the view that the first sentence of clause
19 assists, although it is not essential for, the conclusion to which
I have
come.  The construction for which Mr Oslington has contended would make clause
8.1, in so far as it conferred rights on HJPL
pursuant to clauses 2.1 and 8.1,
unenforceable.  The construction which I favour leads to the result that clause
8.1 remains enforceable.
<P>

246   	There are other clauses, which provide for remedies to be
exercised before the right of termination arises, such as clauses
6.5 and 18.2,
which show that in certain circumstances the parties were prepared to view the
method of termination, at least in the
first instance, differently from that
provided in clause 15.
<P>

247   	The next question is the correct construction of clause
15.  It assumes for the purposes of the Shorter Notice that the conclusion
to
which I have just come is wrong, and it is necessary to decide the point
against that contingency and in relation to the Longer
Notice.   It is not
suggested by BKC that it gave a notice to cure pursuant to clause 15.2.  BKC's
case was that none of the breaches
alleged in the Shorter or the Longer Notices
was "capable of being cured" and, therefore, notice requiring HJPL to do so was
not
needed.  The right to terminate in the case of any breach, which is capable
of being cured, is dependent upon the giving of such
notice and the failure of
HJPL to cure the breach within the contractually stipulated time. In relation
to a breach of clause 2.1,
on the assumption that clause 15 can apply to a
breach of clause 2.1, rather than to a breach of clause 2.1 followed by a
breach
of clause 8.1, the period is 30 days.   The basic submissions in this
regard revolved around the words "which is capable of being
cured".  Mr
Bathurst submitted that if the breach could be characterised as one capable of
being cured then, notwithstanding that
it may not be possible to cure it within
the time specified in clause 15.2, the giving of the notice was a condition
precedent to
the exercise of the right to terminate.  Mr Oslington submitted
that where it was apparent that the breach could not be cured within
the time
specified, it was not a breach "capable of being cured" and, therefore, not one
in respect of which a notice had to be given.
 The submission continued that as
Mr Bathurst had conceded that the breach of clause 2.1 could not have been
cured within thirty
days, it was not a breach capable of being cured.  The
submission of Mr Bathurst was that it was a breach "capable of being cured",
although the time to cure it would take more than thirty days but, as the
breach met the specification of clause 15.2, the giving
of notice was a
condition precedent to exercising the right to terminate, notwithstanding that
at the expiration of thirty days the
breach would have subsisted and a Notice
of Termination could have been given.  Mr Bathurst submitted that clause 15.2
referred to
a breach, which was capable of being cured; not to a breach, which
was capable of being cured within a specified number of days.
 Thus, the
specified number of days did not identify or qualify the breach.  Their purpose
was to provide a time certain within which
the breach, which was capable of
being cured, must be cured.  If it was not then the right to terminate arose.
Of course, this was
a secondary submission to Mr Bathurst's principal
submission in regard to the Shorter Notice, which was based on the more
wide-ranging
submissions and particularly clause 8.1.
<P>

248   	Uninstructed by any authority I read clause 15.2 in the
manner for which Mr Bathurst contended.  That, in my opinion, is
also
consistent with the approach adopted in Batson, Schuler and Tricontinental.
Although Mr Oslington referred to a number of authorities
under s.146 of the
English <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lopa198/" class="autolink_findacts">Law of Property Act</a>, which is in essentially the same terms as s.129 of
the New South Wales <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a>, it seems to me that one is here
confronted with a specific clause to which one must give commercial meaning in
accordance with the
authorities to which I have referred.  The clause is, of
course, of high significance in the present agreement because it determines
the
circumstances in which a reasonably complicated agreement and many rights
associated with it may be terminated, and it seeks
to accommodate not only
breaches of the Development Agreement, but of the Franchise Agreements and any
other obligations owed by
HJPL to BKC.  To say, as Mr Oslington submitted, that
if the breach cannot be cured within the specified time it is not capable of
being cured really begs the question.  It also removes an element of certainty
because it intrudes into consideration the question
of by whom it is to be
decided that the breach is capable of being cured within the specified time.
The purpose of a clause such
as this is, as the authorities to which I have
referred make clear, to give the party the opportunity of curing the position
for
the future.  It is only if that type of cure cannot be achieved that the
breach is one which is not capable of being cured.  What
the clause does is to
require in respect of breaches capable of being cured the giving of notice.
The notice limits the time within
which the default must be cured and, at the
expiration of the specified times, the rights of the parties crystallise.
There may be
many breaches capable of being cured, which cannot be cured within
those times.  If that is so BKC has the right to terminate after
the time
provided in a notice to cure has expired, but that does not mean, nor does the
construction of the Development Agreement
demand, that the capability of being
cured is dependent upon the time.  In those circumstances I consider that in so
far as the breach
is capable of being cured the necessary notice must be given
and, if there is not compliance with it within the specified time, the
right to
terminate may be exercised.
<P>

249   	A clause such as 15.2 is aimed at providing certainty.
On one view the approach taken by Mr Oslington leads to uncertainty.
 It leaves
open the argument, if no notice to cure is given, whether the breach was
capable of being cured, such as to require the
giving of a notice.  However, if
the notice is given and the breach is not cured the arguments are confined to
whether there was
a breach and whether it was cured within the time specified.
On this basis the giving of notice is, in my opinion, a condition precedent
to
the right to terminate.
<P>

250   	Mr Bathurst also submitted that if Mr Oslington's
construction was accepted it would lead to a very strange result.  Let
it be
assumed that there was a breach at some point of time, which was capable of
being cured and had been cured prior to the complaint
being made.  Because it
had been cured it would not be capable of being cured within the time specified
in clause 15.2.  If Mr Oslington's
construction is correct that is not a breach
which is capable of being cured and, accordingly, notwithstanding that it had
been cured
it remains a breach upon which BKC could terminate without giving
notice.  As Mr Bathurst submitted, Tp.3733:-
<P>

"To construe the clause otherwise would produce an absurdity, as it would
involve a party having the opportunity to cure a subsisting
breach whilst
remaining liable to termination in respect of breaches which had in fact
previously been cured."
<P>

I consider, and I have referred to this, that Mr Bathurst's submission is
correct.
<P>

251   	Mr Oslington submitted that one must look at the facts of
the breach in question to decide whether it is capable of being
cured.  The
submission continued that because, on hypothetical facts, the breach was so
capable, regardless of whether the facts
giving rise to the particular breach
enabled it to be cured, it could not be said that the breach was capable of
being cured, because
a fair reading of clause 15.2 denied that construction.
<P>

252   	Mr Oslington submitted that if one could hypothesise
circumstances in which the breach was capable of being cured, although
it was
agreed that the particular breach could not be cured or, to put it more
accurately, could not have been cured, "the contract
operates in a very
uncommercial way because it results in some instances, such as the present, as
a triumph of form over substance".
 He continued that what was required is an
examination of the facts of the breach to see whether it was capable of being
cured and
not an academic analysis of seeing whether a breach can be envisaged
that is capable of cure on the basis of facts totally unrelated
to the breach.
In any event Mr Oslington agreed that the words "which is capable of being
cured" meant, so far as his submission
was concerned, "which is capable of
being cured within the thirty days during which the notice runs".  As I have
noted, Mr Bathurst
submitted that this read words into the clause, which were
not present, with which submission I agree.
<P>

253   	Mr Oslington submitted that Batson demanded that one look
at the facts of the particular breach to determine whether it was
capable of
remedy.  In my respectful opinion his Honour was saying something a little
different.  At pp.426-427, he said:-
<P>

"A breach may, I think, be `capable of remedy', looking at the matter as at the
date of giving notice, even though there is then
no certainty that,
notwithstanding the efforts of the lessee to remedy it, it will be remedied.
What the lessee is entitled to is
an `opportunity of complying with the
requirements of the notice': <i>Fox v Jolly</i>.  He may in the result be
unable to do so, e.g. because he cannot, in the case of a breach of a covenant
to repair, obtain the requisite
material.  Or the actual remedying of the
breach may depend upon securing the concurrence of some other person other than
the lessee,
and in the result it may not be secured.  But I think it may none
the less be said, looking at the matter as at the date of notice,
that the
breach is `capable of remedy' within the meaning of the section.  Hence it
seems to me that a breach consisting in parting
with possession or subletting
without the consent of the lessor may, in some, if not in all, cases, be
capable of remedy by applying
for and securing that consent."
<P>

254   	In my respectful opinion, his Honour was not, in this
passage, asserting that as at the date the notice was given, one had
to be able
to say that the breach would be remedied.  Rather, he was saying that one had
to be able to say that the breach was "capable
of remedy".  The fact that it
was not remedied within the time specified is not to deny the party, which is
entitled to receive the
notice, the opportunity to attempt to cure the
breach.
<P>

255   	In the present circumstances clause 15.2 is covering the
widest possible range of breaches.  To construe the clause in the
manner for
which Mr Oslington has contended would mean that, depending upon the particular
facts, one would or would not give a notice.
 Thus, let it be assumed that the
breach was the failure to have in a restaurant a particular piece of equipment,
which was required
to be imported from the United States.  Let it nextly be
assumed that usually such equipment was transported from the United States
to
Australia by sea and took, from the time of order to the time of delivery, more
than thirty days to arrive in Australia.  On that
hypothesis it could, if Mr
Oslington's submission be correct, be said that the breach was not capable of
being cured.  However, bearing
in mind that the consequence of not curing the
breach is potential termination of the Development Agreement, HJPL may, if
given notice
of the default, organise for the piece of equipment to be flown to
Australia.  At the end of the day it may or may not succeed in
curing the
breach, but it cannot be hypothesised at the date the notice is given in those,
and indeed in very many, circumstances
that the breach will not be cured.  Mr
Oslington sought to answer the paragraph I have just quoted, at Tp.3782, by
stating that all
his Honour was saying was that if there is a possibility that
the breach can be remedied the words "capable of remedy" apply and:-
<P>

"But one thing is clear: his Honour is saying that a notice to cure may not be
given if the facts of the particular breach lead
to a conclusion that the
breach is not capable of remedy."
<P>

256   	The first question on this aspect is one of construction.
I am satisfied that if the breach is one capable of being cured,
whether or not
it could be cured within the time specified in clause 15.2, notice must be
given to activate that clause.
<P>

257   	The next question is whether the breach to which
reference is being made is one capable of being cured in the sense referred
to
in Batson, Schuler and Tricontinental, i.e. whether matters can be put right
for the future.  In this regard Mr Oslington referred
to a number of English
decisions based upon s.146 of the English <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lopa198/" class="autolink_findacts">Law of  Property Act</a>.
<P>

258   	In Batson Sugerman J, commencing at p.524, gave attention
to many of the cases upon which Mr Oslington relied.  After considering
those
authorities, save for one subsequent to Batson to which I shall refer, his
Honour set forth, at p.427, what he considered the
word "remedy" to mean,
namely "to set things right for the future".
<P>

259   	The matter was re-visited in Expert Clothing Service and
Sales Limited v Hilgate House Limited [1986] 1 Ch 340.  
<P>

260   	At p.356 Slade LJ accepted that a notice under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lopa198/s146.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.146</a> need
not be given requiring the tenant to remedy the breach if it was not capable of
remedy within a reasonable time after service
and, at p.357, he drew the
distinction between breaches of negative user covenants, such as were under
consideration in several cases
to which Mr Oslington referred, and breaches of
positive covenants.  He contrasted the two, stating that the breach of a
positive
covenant to do something could ordinarily, for practical purposes, be
remedied if a reasonable time for its performance was allowed.
 He
distinguished cases in which a "stigma" arose by virtue of inappropriate use of
premises, such as for prostitution or gambling.
 At p.358 his Lordship
said:-
<P>

"In my judgment, on the remediability issue, the ultimate question for the
Court was this:  if the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lopa198/s146.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.146</a> notice had required the lessee to remedy the
breach and the lessors had then allowed a reasonable time to elapse to enable
the lessee
fully to comply with the relevant covenant, would such compliance,
coupled with the payment of any appropriate monetary compensation,
have
effectively remedied the harm which the lessors had suffered or were likely to
suffer from the breach?  If, but only if, the
answer to this question is `no',
would the failure of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lopa198/s146.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.146</a> notice to require a remedy of the breach have
been justifiable."
<P>

261   	At p.362 O'Connor LJ asked how breaches not capable of
remedy were to be identified.  He considered that had to be answered
by an
examination of the matter at the date of notice.  He continued:-
<P>

"Once a breach of covenant has been committed, the fact that there has been a
breach cannot be expunged so that to remedy a breach
must mean to do what is
necessary to put the lessor back into the position he would have been in had no
breach been committed.  If
this cannot be done within a reasonable time or at
all, the breach is not capable of remedy; if it can, it is."
<P>

262   	Whilst I have paid careful attention to all these
authorities I do not think that the particular point is one which gives
rise to
much argument on a proper analysis of the Development Agreement.  I say that
because if the breach is not capable of being
cured, it is not a breach in
respect of which notice must be given under clause 15.2.  If, however, the
breach is one which is capable
of being cured, notwithstanding that as matters
stand at the date the notice is given it does not appear to be one which can be
cured
within the time specified, it is none-the-less a breach "capable of being
cured" and the party in breach is entitled to notice to
cure as a condition
precedent to the giving of Notice of Termination.  In the instant case it is
conceded that as at the date of
the giving of the Shorter Notice the breach of
it could not have been cured within the time limited by the clause.  However,
it is
not conceded that the breach was not one capable of being cured.  The
real question then is whether, on the basis of that concession
in relation to
the alleged breach of clause 2.1, there was any requirement to give a notice as
a condition precedent to exercising
the right to terminate.
<P>

263   	As Waddell AJA said in Tricontinental, p.718, the clear
commercial purposes of a provision such as clause 15.2:-
<P>

"... is to provide a mechanism whereby the liability on the part of HBFI can be
established in a way which is unambiguous and certain.
 It is essential in
commercial dealings that provisions of this kind should be applied strictly so
that parties know exactly where
they stand."
<P>

264   	In my opinion the provision of certainty into clause 15.2
is achieved by construing the clause to mean that if the breach
is capable of
being cured, whenever that may be possible, BKC shall not terminate the
agreement unless and until HJPL shall have
failed to cure within the specified
period.  It is not correct to say, on a proper construction of this agreement,
that a breach
is not capable of being cured because it cannot be cured within
the specified period.  Once that submission is rejected then a breach
capable
of being cured remains as such.  That capability requires a notice to cure a
condition precedent to the operation of the
clause.  BKC suffers no real
prejudice because after the expiration of relatively short periods it may, if
the breach is not cured,
terminate the agreement.  Mr Oslington submitted that
this approach meant that I was ignoring the particular facts, viz that as the
breach was not capable of being cured within thirty days it was not a breach
that was capable of being cured.  I disagree on the
basis of the construction
of the agreement which I think is correct.
<P>

265   	Certainly, in the way in which the submission was made, I
do not consider it can be correct.  At Tpp.3797-8, the following
transpired:-
<P>

"HIS HONOUR: Certainly.  Well, can I put this on the transcript as my
understanding.  Mr Bathurst's case is that where there is
a breach which is
capable of being cured, the right to terminate does not arise unless and until
HJPL shall have failed to cure within,
relevantly for presently purposes,
thirty days.  
<P>

Your case is that a breach is not capable of being cured unless it is a breach
which can, relevantly for present purposes, be cured
within thirty days.
<P>

MR OSLINGTON: Yes, your Honour.
<P>

HIS HONOUR: And if it is not a breach which is capable of being cured within
thirty days, having regard to the facts of the particular
breach, it is not a
breach `capable of being cured', and therefore not a breach requiring a
notice.
<P>

MR OSLINGTON: Yes, your Honour."
<P>

Mr Oslington agreed those were the competing arguments on clause 15.2.  For the
reasons I have given, I reject Mr Oslington's submissions.
<P>

Conclusions
<P>

266   	The conclusions I have reached thus far are:-
<P>

(a)	Clause 2.1 is not a condition of the Development Agreement.
<P>

(b)	Clause 2.1 may not be terminated pursuant to clause 15 unless HJPL has had
the opportunity of complying with clause 8 and has
failed to do so.
<P>

(c)	Clause 15.2 cannot be construed to mean that a breach is not capable of
cure because it is not able to be cured within the time
period provided.
<P>

(d)	Clause 15.2 requires that if the breach is capable of cure then a condition
precedent to exercising the right to terminate is
the giving of notice pursuant
to clause 15.2.
<P>

267   	For all the reasons I have  given, I consider that the
Shorter Notice was invalid and had no legal effect in terminating
the
Development Agreement, and that the Longer Notice would only be valid, assuming
clause 15 was the relevant clause, if the breaches
were not capable of being
cured, such that notice to cure did not have to be given.  I have analysed the
breaches alleged in the
Longer Notice.  For the reasons given I do not consider
BKC was entitled to give that Notice and, therefore, I do not consider that
it
had any legal effect in terminating the Development Agreement.
<P>

268   	I have also dealt with the facts relating to the Notice
of Termination of 8 September 1997.  I do not consider that this
notice was
valid or effective to terminate the Development Agreement.
<P>

269   	The conclusion to which I have come is that on a proper
construction of the contractual provisions and on the facts alleged
and to the
extent necessary proved, BKC did not, by the Shorter Notice, the Longer Notice
or the Notice of 8 September 1997, terminate
the Development Agreement, and
that, accordingly, the purported termination of the Development Agreement
constituted a breach of
contract by BKC.  This view is based, essentially, on
the construction of the Development Agreement and my findings that the breaches
said to found the right to terminate were all either capable of being cured, or
had been cured, or, alternatively, were not such
that the Development Agreement
could be determined by clause 15. It did not seem to be in issue that if the
terminations were breaches,
BKC had repudiated the Development Agreement, and
HJPL had not accepted the repudiation and terminated it.  Rather, it maintained
the Development Agreement on foot and elected to sue for damages for its
breach.
<P>

270   	Against the possibility that I may find that BKC had
taken the appropriate steps to terminate the Development Agreement,
HJPL
pleaded that it had waived its right to do so, or was estopped from doing so,
or in doing so had breached implied terms of reasonableness
or good faith. It
relied also on relief against forfeiture. Because of the view to which I have
come it is not necessary, save to
the extent I have, to consider these points.
This case occupied sixty seven hearing days.  There are 4,248 pages of
transcript including
opening and closing addresses.  The closing addresses
supplemented extensive written submissions, those of HJPL running to 353 pages
and those of BKC to 280 pages.  HJPL furnished 91 pages in reply in addition to
oral submissions.  If I am wrong in the view to which
I have come as to the
proper construction of the contract, the submissions cover with thoroughness
the other points.  Nothing, with
the one exception to which I have referred,
depends on an assessment of the credibility of witnesses, which would place me
in a 
more advantageous position than the Court of Appeal to decide.
Accordingly, I do not think it is necessary for me to determine those
points
and I do not propose to do so.
<P>

271   	There are a number of other points to be decided and it
seems to me that the preferable course, in all the circumstances
of this case,
is to decide the points which enable me to reach a decision on all issues.  If
the view is taken that I am in error,
the material necessary for the Court of
Appeal to hear and determine other issues is readily available, if that Court
thinks it appropriate
to decide them.
<P>

272   	The one matter upon which I think it proper for me to
make a finding is in relation to good faith, in the context of an assumption
that there is an obligation to exercise good faith, in the implementation of a
contract, in addition to acting reasonably and co-operatively.
 It was
submitted by Mr Bathurst that BKC did not act in good faith in purporting to
terminate the Development Agreement, as its
actions were motivated by the
desire to be rid of it.  Obviously it acted as it did for that purpose.  No
other inference is open.
 At least prima facie, if it had been entitled in law
to terminate that agreement, its motives for doing so may not have been
relevant.
 The allegation of failing to act in good faith centred around a
desire by BKC to be rid of the Development Agreement not because
it was
contractually entitled to do so, but to enable it to have greater control over
the market conformably with Mr Fitzjohn's remarks
in his note of December 1993
and in circumstances which may have enabled it to deal more advantageously with
Shell.  I have no doubt
that BKC was motivated in the ways to which I have
referred.  It wished to achieve a different commercial playing field for its
advantage.
 There is, in my opinion, nothing wrong with that provided it is not
established that it acted with a lack of good faith in seeking
to achieve that
position.  It is part and parcel of the working out of commercial contracts.
<P>

273   	Where the absence of good faith may play a role is if BKC
acted without proper regard to the rights of HJPL and in circumstances
where
its own conduct precluded HJPL's enjoyment of its contractual rights without
justification.   
<P>

274   	In my opinion, it is not possible to take the conduct in
isolation.  There are a number of matters to which regard will have
to be had.
They include the desire to implement the suggestions set forth in Mr Fitzjohn's
December 1993 memorandum, the willingness
to receive and act on information
supplied by Mr Montgomery, the dealings involving Shell and the concessions
that in those dealings
some conduct of officers of BKC was, at the least,
potentially misleading, and the failures, as I find them to be, to exercise the
discretion to withhold financial approval and refuse operational approval
properly.  The inferences to be drawn from all this conduct,
and the
consequences flowing from it, will have to be considered.
<P>

The Shell Case
<P>

275   	HJPL summarised what Mr Bathurst referred to as "the
Shell Case" thus.  Firstly, prior to 1 March 1994, BKC and HJPL were
negotiating separately with Shell with a view to their introducing Burger King
restaurants to certain Shell sites.  The essence of
the submission was that BKC
engaged in a deliberate and concerted course of action to deal with Shell to
the exclusion, ultimately,
of HJPL.  HJPL's complaint was that by the end of
1993 or by early 1994 it had entered into negotiations with BKC and Shell on
the
basis that the three companies would be involved in a test site agreement,
and, subject to that proving successful which the parties
contemplated at the
time it would, that they would together join in a co-operative situation or
joint venture whereby there would
be approximately seventy further Burger King
restaurants at Shell sites mainly in New South Wales and Victoria.  These would
provide
a financial benefit to each company from its involvement in the
enterprise.  Whilst the parties were waiting to see whether the test
site
agreement would be successful, they were taking steps, including the
expenditure of money, in relation to the development of
the larger envisaged
arrangement.
<P>

276   	HJPL's written submissions traced the discussions between
Shell and it from 1988 in terms, which were not essentially in
issue.  HJPL
attempted to establish a Hungry Jack's restaurant at the Shell site at Westgate
Bridge, although this was not ultimately
successful.
<P>

277   	In June 1993 BKC had its initial discussions with Shell,
during which Shell drew to the attention of BKC its prior dealings
with
HJPL.
<P>

278   	By October 1993 BKC proposed that Shell become its
"petroleum industry" franchisee in Australia and that a trial of the concept
be
tested.  There were communications between the parties in furtherance of this
and the internal communications between Mr Jones,
who was then the senior BKC
executive resident in Australia, and representatives of BKC in Miami, showed
that Mr Jones was interested
in dealing with Shell to the exclusion of HJPL.
<P>

279   	On 15 February 1994 Mr Fitzjohn sent Mr Cowin the "Agenda
for Action" in preparation for a meeting between Messrs Fitzjohn,
Miolla,
Cowin, Montgomery and McCarthy on 28 February 1994, which made specific
reference to the proposed "Shell Test Agreement".
 The visit of the BKC
executives to Sydney led to a meeting between them and representatives of Shell
and HJPL on 1 March 1994, at
which Shell made a presentation, about its
intention in relation to the development of a "business alliance" with "the
Burger King
system".  During that meeting that Mr Mummery of Shell stated that
it wanted to build seventy units over a number of years and to
achieve
"exclusivity/first right" in respect of the operation of Burger King
restaurants at service station sites.  There was no
specific reference at the
meeting to the establishment of "test sites", nor to the possibility that the
"business alliance" was contingent
upon the conduct of such sites.
<P>

280   	Mr Fitzjohn stated that the partnership between BKC and
HJPL had been re-affirmed, that there would be a single point of
contact
between HJPL and BKC, and that he may have raised the question of the trade
name.  He agreed it was likely that he told Shell
that HJPL was BKC's business
partner and restaurant operator, which he considered to be the case.
<P>

281   	On the following day Mr Cowin was briefed about the
meeting with Shell by Messrs Fitzjohn, Miolla, McCarthy and Montgomery,
and a
decision was taken by BKC that Messrs Montgomery and McCarthy would be the
principal contacts on behalf of BKC and HJPL to
develop the Shell opportunity.
There was no BKC representative in Australia then, Mr Jones having left for New
Zealand and Mr Power
not having been appointed.  Mr Fitzjohn acknowledged in
his evidence that BKC needed HJPL to participate in the proposed "business
alliance" as the operator to run the restaurants at the Shell sites, the Shell
presentation not having envisaged that it would be
the operator of the
restaurants.
<P>

282   	These plans were implemented through various discussions,
Shell advising on 7 March 1994 that Mr McKenzie and Mr Burrow would
be the
primary contacts on behalf of Shell "for the continued development of this
concept".  Mr McKenzie also advised that Shell
was preparing information for Mr
McCarthy about possible development sites around Australia.  Mr Miolla
acknowledged in cross-examination
that he was aware, from that date, that
Shell, BKC and HJPL were engaged in discussions as to the terms of the legal
relationship
between them and were also going forward and exploring appropriate
sites, which may be appropriate if the test was successful, and
further that
HJPL's executives were spending time and investing money on the project.
<P>

283   	On 23 March 1994 Mr McKenzie sent a facsimile
transmission to Mr Montgomery confirming a meeting between Shell and HJPL
representatives
on 29 March 1994 in Melbourne.  The agenda set out a number of
matters, including the trial or pilot development, for discussion.
<P>

284   	On 28 March 1994 Mr Fitzjohn wrote three letters in
relation to the Shell development, the first being to Mr McCarthy, which
stated, inter alia, that Mr Fitzjohn was "very excited by this opportunity" and
that he was convinced "that the gas stations and
oil companies represent a
significant opportunity for this brand as we move forward over the next two to
three years".
<P>

285   	The significance of this statement was that there could
be no suggestion that the relationship as envisaged by Mr Fitzjohn
and
communicated by him to HJPL was intended to be confined only to the test site
arrangements, unless, of course, those arrangements
failed to produce a
satisfactory conclusion.  Thus BKC was proceeding, at the least with HJPL, on a
path of investigating a long-term
future joint venture arrangement, with the
belief that it would probably eventuate.
<P>

286   	The second letter from Mr Fitzjohn was sent to Mr Cowin.
Mr Fitzjohn raised the possibility of a BKC investment in the test
sites with
Shell:-
<P>

".. alongside Hungry Jack's to create a small number of test sites with Shell
in what could become a joint venture if this results
in a roll-out across
Australia."
<P>

The prospect of a long-term joint venture could hardly have been stated more
clearly.  The letter continued:-
<P>

"The tests would be on a 50/50 capital investment basis, shared equally between
Hungry Jack's and BKC.  Shell, the landlord, will
erect the building for us and
fit it out prior to our equipment installation.  The operation would then be
managed on a day to day
basis by your own organisation at cost and we would
have to work out a fair distribution of the P&amp;L impact so that we would
both
obtain a return on our investment.
<P>

I would emphasise that this is at present only an expression of interest.
However, if we can firm up the precise nature of the sites
and the financial
evaluations backing up the investment proposal I will put it to Jim Adamson for
a formal approval for the capital
for a test on the first four to six
units."
<P>

287   	Mr Fitzjohn's third letter was to Mr Mummery, a copy
being sent to Mr Cowin.  A "preliminary agreement" to be entered into
between
BKC and Shell was attached to it, and Mr Fitzjohn stated:-
<P>

"In the event that we are able to agree on terms for buildings to give us
representation on the site, these units will trade under
the Hungry Jack's
trade name capitalising upon the brand equity in the Australian market place.
We at Burger King Corporation are
excited about this opportunity to the extent
that we are considering forming a joint venture to support our colleagues at
Hungry
Jack's with meaningful capital investment to test this concept."
<P>

288   	Mr Miolla acknowledged that, at least as at 28 March
1994, HJPL, BKC and Shell were to be involved in the arrangements to
develop
Burger King restaurants at Shell sites, and it was contemplated that the three
companies would be involved in at least some,
if not all of those sites, if the
test sites were successful.
<P>

289   	On 29 March 1994 there was a meeting between Shell and
HJPL representatives, which commenced with a similar presentation
to that of
the meeting on 1 March 1994.  There was discussion about the test sites and
various other matters, and the minutes recorded:-
<P>

"This particular meeting was intended to focus more specifically on how a
relationship between Shell and BK/HJ could be progressed
and put into operation
on a test basis as soon as possible, in order to establish in the first
instance compatibility of companies
in systems and to look at guidelines and
principles for a larger scale and long-term arrangement between the parties
which could
be implemented on a national basis."
<P>

290   	Mr Fitzjohn received a copy of these minutes, which he
read, and he accepted that between his meeting in early March and
that meeting
HJPL had been taking the principal role on behalf of BKC and itself in
forwarding the proposals with Shell and was expending
its capital to advance
them.  Mr Fitzjohn conceded that, to his perception, HJPL was doing so as it
perceived that a long-term benefit
could accrue to it and BKC from the
proposal, and that it was his understanding that HJPL perceived itself as a
joint venturer with
BKC in relation to the proposal, subject to the
qualification that the test was successful.  His evidence made it clear that,
at
that time, he was contemplating a long-term relationship between the three
companies: Tpp.2227-2228.
<P>

291   	Mr McKenzie responded favourably to Mr Fitzjohn's letter
of 28 March 1994, noting in that letter that Shell had been progressing
the
concept discussed "with your colleagues at Hungry Jack's" and that Shell was
working "closely with them on a number of trial
locations".  Mr Fitzjohn said
he was sure he read the letter from which he understood that the venture
between BKC, Shell and HJPL
was progressing well and:-
<P>

"Q. And of course the only purpose of pursuing this venture with Shell from
both the position of Burger King and Hungry Jack's to
your perception, was a
belief that it could result in a long-term relationship with Shell for both
Hungry Jack's and Burger King;
correct?
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. If one came to be aware that there was no reasonable prospect of that, there
was no purpose in going forward with this; correct?
<P>

A. Yes": Tpp.2228-2229.
<P>

292   	The position thus far reached was that the three parties
intended to proceed on a test site basis and on a more expansive
basis over a
long term provided that the test site situation did not lead to any business or
commercial difficulties, which made
a longer term relationship inappropriate.
The significance of this was that there was a clear expectation by the parties
that the
test site arrangements were being pursued in the context of a
potentially longer term relationship in which, at the least, the parties
would
be joint venturers.
<P>

293   	Mr Bathurst put the submission in this way.  He said it
was important to remember that the meeting of 1 March 1994 was not
in the
context "of setting up a couple of restaurants to see what would happen".  That
submission was made to counter what he understood
to be the thrust of BKC's
submissions, namely that the negotiations were only in relation to restaurants
the subject of the Test
Site Agreement and did not go beyond that. 
<P>

294   	In paragraph 22.13 of his written submissions, Mr
Bathurst commenced to deal with the chronology to which I have referred,
which
he submitted demonstrated that the negotiations were not confined to the Test
Site Agreements, but were entered into with the
intention of forming a
long-term alliance, although that was "in some way contingent on the test sites
being successful".  However,
he submitted that contingency was imposed in the
expectation "that the arrangements would take place on a tripartite basis" and,
if successful, this would eventuate.  He referred to the evidence of Mr
Fitzjohn in paragraphs 22.21 and .23 of the written submissions
and stressed
that he was unequivocal that a long-term relationship was being considered.
The submission continued that there were
good reasons for Mr Fitzjohn to take
that position, the essential one being that BKC was not able, in March 1994, to
proceed to develop
with Shell without HJPL's assistance, because BKC did not
have access to the necessary infrastructure, save through HJPL. Therefore,
as
the Shell arrangement was important from BKC's point of view, the involving of
HJPL in it was a matter of great significance.
 The evidence on which reliance
was placed to support this submission is collected in paragraphs 19.13 and .14
of the written submissions,
in the latter paragraph it being noted, inter alia,
that as late as February 1995 Mr Fitzjohn realised that if HJPL withdrew from
the test arrangements there would be nobody to run the existing test
restaurants in Australia, so that it suited the purpose of BKC,
so it was
submitted, for HJPL to become actively involved in the planning and discussions
with Shell for the operation of co-branded
restaurants.
<P>

295   	In paragraph 19.5 of his written submissions, Mr Bathurst
referred to evidence to support the proposition that throughout
the remainder
of 1994 and in early 1995 Messrs Fitzjohn, Miolla and Power were aware that
HJPL was devoting substantial time and
money to the establishment of the two
test sites and in participating with Shell employees in the identification of
future sites
for co-branded development.  So much was not in issue and, in so
far as it may have been, I accept that HJPL was acting in that way.
 Indeed the
evidence is that Messrs Fitzjohn and Miolla, at least, were caused acute
embarrassment in early 1995 when Shell advised
that it was not prepared to
proceed with HJPL and, thereafter, in circumstances which reflect no credit on
them, they failed to advise
HJPL for some time.  It was submitted by Mr
Bathurst, and in my view this is the proper inference to draw, that Messrs
Fitzjohn and
Miolla adopted this course, i.e. delayed advising HJPL of Shell's
attitude, until they were satisfied that Shell was prepared to
enter into a
firm relationship with BKC.  Notwithstanding their earlier knowledge of Shell's
attitude, Messrs Fitzjohn and Miolla
were prepared to allow HJPL to continue to
invest not insubstantial amounts and time in progressing what HJPL obviously
understood
to be the arrangements for a long-term tripartite agreement.  Not
only did those officers of BKC and others fail to advise HJPL of
Shell's change
of mind, but they also actively took advantage of it to bring about a situation
whereby BKC would deal with Shell
to the exclusion of HJPL.  This conduct, on
the part of BKC, gave rise to the allegations of breach of fiduciary duty.
<P>

296   	The various activities in which HJPL engaged are set
forth in paragraphs 22.25 to 22.28 of its written submissions and, in
paragraph
22.26, reference is made to the evidence that when Mr Power took up his
position with BKC in Australia in about late July
1994 he understood that if
the test was successful there would be continuing involvement by both BKC and
HJPL in any future relationship
with Shell.
<P>

297   	Mr Miolla conceded that he believed that HJPL expected to
be involved in any venture with Shell, that that was the basis
on which HJPL
was investing time and money, and that it would have been "unethical" for BKC
to encourage Shell to proceed to the
exclusion of HJPL in those circumstances.
However, that, so it was submitted, and I am satisfied that this is the fact,
was precisely
what BKC did.
<P>

298   	In this context some very significant evidence was
elicited from Mr Fitzjohn.  It is referred to in paragraph 22.25(e) of
the
written submissions.  On 14 July 1994 Mr Fitzjohn sent a facsimile transmission
to Mr Mummery, which he copied to Messrs McCarthy,
Montgomery, Miolla and
Power.  It stated that BKC continued to be "very excited about the possible
strategic alliance"; that new
BKC employees were to be appointed in Australia,
but that it remained most efficient for Messrs Montgomery and McCarthy to be
Shell's
principal points of contact; and that they had done "an excellent job"
of keeping BKC informed of progress in relation to the three
test locations.
Mr Fitzjohn agreed that when he sent that message BKC was still reliant upon
either HJPL or Shell to provide resources
to move forward the alliance with
Shell, and that he was putting HJPL forward as an organisation eminently
qualified to participate
in the joint venture, which was to form the basis of
the strategic alliance with Shell.  He continued that he would not have risked
that strategic alliance by putting HJPL forward in that context unless he had
complete confidence in its competence to perform the
role and that having made
every attempt to satisfy himself of that matter he considered HJPL was
appropriate to be so put forward.
 Reference was then made to re-examination of
Mr Fitzjohn on this point at Tp.2470, when he was asked by Mr Oslington whether
his
views remained the same about HJPL after July 1994 and he said that they
did.  This concession was the more potent coming as it did
in
re-examination.
<P>

299   	Mr Bathurst, quite understandably, fastened on it
because, as he submitted, Mr Fitzjohn was the most senior officer of BKC
on the
development side, who was called.  He continued that I would have to contrast
the views he expressed with the submissions
made by BKC, firstly, that the
Shell arrangements, so far as HJPL was concerned, were terminated because of
some mutually perceived
dissatisfaction with HJPL by Shell and BKC.  The
submission was that this evidence showed that could not have been, as a matter
of
fact, the truth.  Secondly, it was submitted that Mr Fitzjohn's evidence
stood "in stark contrast to the denial of operational and
financial approval",
because if HJPL was "good enough" in Mr Fitzjohn's view to be involved in the
development with Shell, there
could be no real reason why it was not good
enough to develop elsewhere in Australia.  Mr Fitzjohn was involved with the
development
area and, as I have noted, there was a deliberate division between
it and other areas.  However, linked with this submission was
the failure by
BKC to call the relevant operations manager, Mr Blauer, who was the most senior
man on the operational side with relevant
responsibility to give evidence that,
from an operational perspective, HJPL was not suitable to be considered for the
joint venture
with Shell. Mr Oslington's submission was that it was hardly
surprising that Shell expressed dissatisfaction with HJPL having regard
to its
poor operational record, which manifested itself in many ways and led,
ultimately, to operational disapproval.  However, Mr
Bathurst pointed to the
fact that not only was no evidence called from BKC on this point, and that the
evidence from Mr Fitzjohn
and, so far as Mr Blauer's letter of 27 November 1995
disclosed, from Mr Blauer, was to the contrary, but that no evidence was called
from Shell to explain the reason for the views to which, according to BKC
officers, it was said to have come.
<P>

300   	The submissions of HJPL were that notwithstanding that no
final agreement was entered into in relation to the longer term
development
proposal between it, BKC and Shell, the fact that the parties were negotiating
to bring about that agreement, and taking
the preliminary steps of having
several test sites, gave rise to a series of fiduciary duties owed by BKC and
Shell, relevantly for
present purposes, to HJPL, such that if either BKC or
Shell sought to subvert the arrangements in so far as they included HJPL and,
of course, without advising HJPL that the negotiations in which the parties
were engaging were at an end, there were breaches of
fiduciary duty entitling
HJPL to equitable compensation.
<P>

301   	The asserted breach of fiduciary duty was considered in
detail in paragraph 30 of HJPL's written submissions.  The terms
pleaded are
set forth in paragraph 30.1 and, in paragraph 30.2, it was submitted that the
joint venture or proposed joint venture
existed prior to the Test Site
Agreement between the parties, which was executed in February 1995 and
exchanged on or about 20 March
1995.
<P>

302   	In paragraph 30.3 it was submitted that by reason of
either the joint venture or proposed joint venture, BKC owed fiduciary
duties
and obligations to HJPL, which required that it not take steps, either itself
or in conjunction with Shell, to exclude HJPL
from the development, operation
and/or servicing of Burger King restaurants at Shell service stations in
Australia, and that those
duties required that the two parties, namely BKC and
Shell, must not secretly negotiate to exclude HJPL from the proposed joint
venture.
 Alternatively, it was submitted, the dealings between HJPL and BKC,
so far as they concerned negotiations with Shell, were directed
to the
formation of a joint venture between HJPL and BKC to establish and operate
Burger King restaurants at Shell service stations
in Australia, and BKC owed
HJPL fiduciary and contractual duties of good faith in relation to that.
<P>

303   	The submission continued that there existed from March
1994 either a venture by HJPL and BKC to deal jointly with Shell for
the
promotion of a long-term relationship with it through the medium of a Test Site
Agreement; and/or a venture by the three companies
to undertake the
establishment and operation of a series of restaurants under the terms of a
Test Site Agreement to be executed in
due course, with a view to establishing a
long-term relationship, which would involve Shell establishing restaurants at
service stations
utilising the Burger King system but operated or serviced by
HJPL.  The submission continued that the fact that detailed arrangements
were
still the subject of negotiation heightened the element of trust and confidence
which existed between HJPL and BKC, the essential
subject matter of the
arrangement between them being the opportunity to develop a long-term
relationship with Shell after the development
of the test restaurants and
provided that proved successful.  Each was dependent on the other to do all in
its power to convert that
opportunity into reality, or, from a negative point
of view, not to do anything which would jeopardise that occurring.
<P>

304   	In these circumstances Mr Bathurst submitted that whilst
the arrangements, albeit in a loose and not finally formulated form,
continued,
the fiduciary duties also continued, which had the effect of precluding BKC
from encouraging, either expressly or impliedly,
Shell from proceeding without
HJPL's involvement and from not taking active steps to try to ensure that Shell
would continue with
the long-term plans.
<P>

305   	Reliance was placed upon the decisions of the High Court
in United Dominions Corporation Limited v Brian Pty Limited <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20157%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 157 CLR 1</a> at
12; Australian Breeders Co-operative Society Limited v Jones <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1997/1405.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] FCA 1405</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2026%20ACSR%2026" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 26 ACSR 26</a>;
and Marr v Arabco Traders Limited [1987] 1 NZBLC 102,732 at 102,745.
<P>

306   	The submission continued that the common object of BKC
and HJPL was the promotion of a continuing relationship between them
and Shell,
the effectuation of that object depending upon both relying on the other to
deal with Shell, and as between themselves,
"with utmost good faith".  In these
circumstances it was submitted that in so far as BKC was in a fiduciary
relationship with HJPL
on either basis that carried with it a fiduciary duty to
refrain from pursuing, obtaining or retaining for itself any collateral
advantage from the proposed project without the knowledge and informed assent
of the other participants: United Dominions at p.13.
 Further, it was
submitted, BKC owed a duty of utmost good faith to HJPL: United Dominions at
p.6 and Bialla v Mallina  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACSR%20785" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 ACSR 785</a> at p.831.
<P>

307   	Clause 16 of the Test Site Agreement contained an "entire
understanding" provision, which Mr Bathurst submitted was no answer
to the
allegation concerning the fiduciary obligations for which he contended.  He
submitted, firstly, that as a matter of construction
the clause was only
concerned with matters "connected with the subject matter of the agreement",
and superseded and merged any prior
agreement or understanding; and with the
fact that each party entered into the agreement without relying on any
representation by
the other.  The basic submission was that the clause was only
concerned with the subject matter of the Test Site Agreement, which
did not
regulate or purport to regulate the entire relationship between the three
companies, but rather was, in effect, one incident
of the joint venture or
proposed joint venture between them.
<P>

308   	Secondly, Mr Bathurst submitted that in any event the
Test Site Agreement was not executed until February 1995 and exchanged
until
after 20 March 1995, whereas the conduct which amounted to a breach of duty had
occurred prior to that date.  That conduct
involved Shell's having raised the
possibility of being a direct franchisee with BKC in September 1994; BKC and
Shell having discussed
in October 1994 the need to send a letter to HJPL
indicating that Shell preferred to deal with BKC rather than HJPL; on 27
February
1995, Mr Lannen having reiterated Shell's position that it was not
prepared to go forward opening restaurants, while they were called
"Hungry
Jack's" and supported by HJPL; and BKC's having not sought to dissuade Shell
from that position or having obtained HJPL's
fully informed consent to it.
<P>

309   	It was submitted that in breach of the duties pleaded in
paragraphs 28 to 31 of the Summons, BKC and Shell were discussing
and
developing plans, no later than September 1994, to expand the business of the
joint venture to the exclusion of HJPL; that they
pursued those plans; and that
they did not inform HJPL until, at the earliest, mid-May 1995 of the
possibility that HJPL might be
excluded from participating in the joint
venture.  In the meantime they allowed HJPL to continue to pursue matters
relevant to the
joint venture, including expending considerable amounts.  On 18
July 1995 BKC entered into a second Test Site Agreement with Shell
to the
exclusion of HJPL and, so it was submitted, BKAL was knowingly involved in
BKC's breach of duty, at least from its incorporation.
<P>

310   	At Tp.3880 Mr Bathurst put the way in which he asserted
BKC breached its fiduciary obligations "a little more precisely".
 He submitted
that that arose at the very least by BKC's encouraging Shell to go ahead
without HJPL; secondly, by BKC's taking the
benefit of the service royalties
from the Shell restaurants to the exclusion of HJPL; and, thirdly, by BKC's
withholding the fact
that negotiations were taking place with Shell behind
HJPL's back.
<P>

311   	In paragraph 22.31 of the written submissions Mr Bathurst
set forth a series of matters, which it was submitted supported
these
propositions.  Reference was made to meetings between Messrs Power and McKenzie
on 19 September 1994 and between Messrs McKenzie,
Power, Paci, Miolla and
Payne-Drueke on 14 October 1994; a meeting between Messrs Farnik, Fitzjohn,
Paci, Beaudrand, Miolla and Power
on 2 November 1994; a meeting between Messrs
Power, McKenzie and Lannen on 5 December 1994; and a meeting between Messrs
Fitzjohn,
Hothorn, Power, Mummery and Lannen on 16 February 1995.  By 19
February 1995 Mr Fitzjohn was concerned that if he told HJPL that
it was
effectively excluded from any long-term benefit from the arrangement with
Shell, it would have withdrawn from further participation
in that arrangement,
and that that was one of the reasons why he decided not to do so.  He agreed
that, to his knowledge, HJPL at
that time had no real possibility of benefiting
in the long-term from the joint venture alliance with Shell.
<P>

312   	In February 1995 there were meetings between Messrs
Fitzjohn, Hothorn and Cowin at a Franchisee Convention in Bangkok.  During
one
such meeting, Mr Hothorn, on Mr Fitzjohn's instructions, offered to Mr Cowin to
reimburse HJPL for the costs of the tripartite
Test Agreement.  Mr Hothorn
denied that the reason for making the offer was because of knowledge about
Shell's attitude as expressed
to Mr Fitzjohn at the meeting of 16 February
1995, and it was submitted that Mr Fitzjohn used Mr Hothorn to make the offer
so that
he, Mr Fitzjohn, would not have to do so and, accordingly, answer any
embarrassing questions raised by Mr Cowin.  Mr Fitzjohn said
he assumed Mr
Hothorn knew of Shell's attitude, although Mr Hothorn said he did not. 
<P>

313   	Mr Cowin did not accept the offer and, on 27 February
1995, Mr Power had a telephone conversation with Mr Lannen after which
he sent
a note to Messrs Fitzjohn, Miolla, Giresi and Hothorn, in which he advised that
he had received a telephone call from Mr
Lannen, who told him that the Kingsway
site issue had been resolved and that Shell was ready to proceed with the
second test site,
but asked "how he wanted to manage this, before advising HJ
that the site was now available".  Mr Lannen asked how the site ought
to be
branded to which Mr Power said he replied that "ideally" BKC would like to have
it branded as a Burger King site, but there
was an agreement in place that
required BKC to allow HJPL to operate the first three test sites.  This was the
memorandum that continued:-
<P>

"He took the trouble to reiterate the Shell position that they were not
prepared to go forward opening restaurants with us while
they were called HJ
and supported by HJ.  I confirmed that we had clearly received that message and
were dealing not with the `whether
to' question but with the `how to' question
at this stage."
<P>

314   	This, in my opinion, was a significant communication.
Certain evidence was led to try to establish that it was nothing more
than one
between two low ranking officers and that, accordingly, no particular
significance should be attached to it.  Mr Bathurst
submitted that proposition
should not be accepted firstly, because the telephone conversation was "plainly
a follow up of the meeting"
of 16 February 1995, and, secondly, because the
language was plainly referable to an earlier discussion on the various topics
raised.
 I accept that submission and in my view, of high significance, is the
failure by either Mr Fitzjohn or Mr Miolla, or indeed any
other senior officer
of BKC, to advise Mr Power that the position he had set forth was not the true
one and to take any steps to
correct the situation.
<P>

315   	At the risk of repetition, it is to be noted that there
was no evidence from Shell as to why it had taken this position,
nor as to what
its attitude would have been if BKC had stated that it was committed to
proceeding with HJPL and intended to do so.
<P>

316   	On 1 March 1995 Mr Fitzjohn had a conference telephone
call with Mr Power and two representatives of Host Marriott, after
which Mr
Power sent a note of the conversation to Mr Miolla, which stated, inter alia,
that Shell was not interested in moving forward
with HJPL, but wanted BKC,
including the brand name.  Host Marriott was seen as a possible substitute for
HJPL.   It was made absolutely
clear that Shell was seeking to proceed with
BKC.  Various attempts to explain away this evidence by Mr Fitzjohn and Mr
Power should,
in my view, be rejected.  They were quite spurious and it was
obvious that by 1 March 1995 Shell had made it clear to BKC that it
wished to
continue with BKC.  BKC did nothing to dissuade it from that attitude nor to
advise HJPL.  Mr Power expressed his obvious
reservations about the situation
in the memorandum to Mr Fitzjohn of 21 March 1995.  It is clear he appreciated
that there was, at
the least, the possibility that BKC was allowing the
position to be misrepresented to HJPL.  Mr Fitzjohn agreed that Mr Power's
memorandum
raised problems associated with not informing HJPL of Shell's
attitude; that he had been conscious of those problems from early February;
but
that he did nothing to remove them until mid-May 1995.  Mr Miolla agreed that
at least by 21 March 1995 he was aware that Mr
Power held the view that Shell
wished to proceed with BKC and not HJPL, and that he did not recall any
conversation in which anyone
from BKC took the view that Shell should be
discouraged from adopting that course, nor did he see any document taking that
stance.
 I am satisfied BKC never adopted that attitude, its reason being that
it suited its overall strategy of developing the market in
Australia, in the
way it wished, to have Shell abandon HJPL.  BKC was content with that course,
once it was satisfied that Shell
was committed to it.  Those arrangements were
being entered into behind HJPL's back and whilst notwithstanding their
existence and
BKC's and Shell's obvious knowledge of them, HJPL was being
allowed to continue to expend time and money to advance the joint venture
not
knowing that the others had no intention of doing so.  In my opinion, BKC's
approach, in all the these circumstances, was thoroughly
discreditable.
<P>

317   	Thereafter the position became worse so far as BKC was
concerned.  On 15 March 1995 Mr Cowin wrote to Mr Hothorn advising
that Mobil
had approached HJPL about the possibility of a strategic alliance in respect of
thirty two Mobil sites between Sydney
and North Queensland.  On 16 March 1995
Mr Power had a meeting with Messrs Lannen, Mummery and McKenzie, during which
there was discussion
about Shell being a franchisee and a commitment by BKC to
support Shell directly in Australia.  Mr Power said he felt that there
was
"perhaps" a need for a communication to HJPL in relation to Shell's attitude.
He also said that his notes indicated the likelihood
that HJPL would not have
ongoing access to Shell test sites as a franchisee.
<P>

318   	On 21 March 1995 Mr Power sent two memoranda to Messrs
Fitzjohn, Hothorn and some others in relation to Shell.  In the first
he
advised that Shell had been very explicit about its intent to become the
franchisee in all locations possible, and had sought
a commitment from BKC for
a clear sign of its commitment to the market for the long term:-
<P>

".. and also made it blatantly obvious that they did not want to continue the
relationship for the long term with BK, if they would
have to rely on the
current service partner structure in Australia via HJ.  This Marriott
opportunity must involve into a drive by
them to buy-out HJ at least in the
East and then we address the field support/training issues with BK
resources."
<P>

Mr Power referred to the necessity to be sensitive to the royalty question,
meaning thereby that the concessional royalty agreement
with HJPL should be
avoided with Shell.  In his second memorandum Mr Power said he had raised with
Mr Mummery the possibility of
a direct communication between Mr Fitzjohn and Mr
Farnik about the opportunities associated with a potential Marriott/Shell
relationship.
<P>

319   	On 23 March 1995 Messrs Fitzjohn, Giresi, Hothorn, Miolla
and Power conferred in relation to a resolution of the conflicting
positions
between HJPL and Shell about future development of co-branded restaurants,
although, at this stage, HJPL had not been advised
of the problems.  It was
agreed that there should be an immediate communication from BKC to HJPL about
Shell's attitude, but that
before that there should be a tele-conference
between Messrs Fitzjohn and Farnik to re-confirm Shell's commitment to grow
within
the Burger King system and to seek its agreement in relation to the
communication to be made to HJPL.  This demonstrated, quite clearly,
that BKC
was determined to ensure that Shell would remain in an agreement with it,
before BKC advised HJPL of the true position.
 It highlighted the way in which
BKC was prepared to "use" HJPL, notwithstanding that there was a joint venture.
It also went a long
way to negating, as was subsequently alleged, a bona fide
held view by BKC that HJPL was not operating in an acceptable manner. 
It was
left to Mr Fitzjohn to determine how and when HJPL should be so advised.  At
this stage Mr Power also noted that Shell had
requested a right of first
refusal with BKC, and that BKC was initially disinclined to consider that
request.  Mr Miolla agreed that
if HJPL was excluded from the arrangement with
Shell, and Shell had a right of first refusal in any particular area, HJPL
would be
precluded from developing through the opening of stores at service
stations in that area, and that the impact of that right of first
refusal made
it more important to inform HJPL immediately of BKC's understanding of Shell's
intentions.
<P>

320   	After that conference call Mr Hothorn prepared a draft
letter to Mr Cowin on 23 March 1995 in relation to the Mobil Oil opportunity,
which he sent by facsimile transmission to Mr Miolla.  Some changes were made
to the letter, which was sent on 30 March 1995, but
it made no reference to the
Shell position and, it was submitted, correctly in my view, that the letter was
misleading.  The letter
"talked up" the advantages of proceeding with Shell,
the obvious implication being that that would be in conjunction with HJPL,
notwithstanding
that BKC knew full well what Shell's asserted attitude was and
that BKC was doing nothing to change its mind, and based on "the magnitude
of
the Shell opportunity and the adverse impact of beginning discussions with
Mobil about an exclusive deal that would freeze out
potential Shell sites"
stated that it would not be "in our best interests" to enter into an exclusive
arrangement with Mobil Oil
"at this time".  Mr Hothorn conceded that he drafted
the letter intending to convey to Mr Cowin that Shell was the best partner for
BKC and HJPL in Australia.  He acknowledged that when he did so he knew of
Shell's attitude to a long-term relationship with HJPL
to which he made no
reference in the letter; and he conceded it was possible that the reference to
"partner" would be "somewhat misleading".
 It was obviously misleading and, in
my view, the proper inference was that it was intended to be so, in so far as
it suggested that
Shell was interested in a long-term relationship with HJPL
and that BKC was doing all it could to foster that relationship.  It was
also
intended to act as a disincentive to HJPL's entering into arrangements with
other service station proprietors on the basis that
Shell was the most
suitable.  Mr Hothorn was a senior operations officer.  Mr Miolla was the
responsible legal officer.  Their conduct
in allowing such a letter to be sent
was, for these reasons, commercially disgraceful.
<P>

321   	On 23 March 1995 Mr Miolla drafted the letter to be sent
to Mr Cowin in relation to the Shell view of the relationship, which
was
amended on 6 April 1995 after the video conference with Shell.  This letter was
being drafted when the other letter of 23 March
1995 was being prepared, which
underscored the duplicity of BKC.  Further revisions were made but the letter
was not sent by Mr Fitzjohn
until 15 May 1995.
<P>

322   	On 24 March 1995, Mr Power received and forwarded to
Messrs Miolla and Hothorn a preliminary advice from HJPL about the forty
five
sites it was interested in developing in the forthcoming year, and he raised
the question as to how BKC was to handle the issue
of Shell's wanting to
operate their own sites in the event of an HJPL application having been made
for the same sites.  He also raised
the question of applying TRA's with Shell
and, on 27 March 1995, Mr Fitzjohn wrote to Mr Farnik advising that BKC was
considering
the ramifications regarding development beyond the three site Test
Agreement.
<P>

323   	On 30 March 1995 Mr Hothorn sent to Mr Cowin the final
version of his letter about the Mobil inquiry, which was unchanged
in relation
to its reference to Shell's being the best possible partner.  He conceded that
it was obvious to him that Mr Cowin was
talking about an exclusive longer-term
arrangement with Mobil; and that he was responding to that possibility on the
basis that it
was better to stay with Shell, notwithstanding his knowledge of
Shell's attitude.
<P>

324   	Mr Miolla conceded that, in hindsight, parts of the
letter were confusing and particularly misleading and he could not answer
a
question as to how the letter was sent having regard to BKC's knowledge of the
Shell position.  His evidence, Tpp.2936-2937, was:-
<P>

"Q.  The problem I have about that answer, Mr Miolla, and I will indicate it
for your consideration and response - is how that letter
could possibly have
been sent in light of the conference call a few days before, unless it was
intended to lull Mr Cowin into a false
sense of security.  
<P>

A. I won't make something up.  I don't have an answer for that.
<P>

Q. You've said several times that, with the benefit of hindsight, you would not
have written that letter.
<P>

A. Or I would have delayed it until after the letter of May 15th.
<P>

Q. Yes, but as you sat in Miami in the latter part of March 1995, you must have
been aware that the letter of 30 March 1995 was,
at best, likely to mislead Mr
Cowin, with all the store of knowledge you had, must you not?
<P>

A. Well I know that I don't have a great answer for that, but I know myself,
and I know that I wouldn't have sent a letter that
I affirmatively felt was
going to deceive someone, so I know it sounds inadequate, but I can only say
that I either wasn't thinking
carefully enough or that, for some reason, I
didn't make the connection in my mind between - you know.  Like I said, I am
not going
to make something up.  That's all I can recollect."
<P>

325   	Mr Miolla said that he was not overborne by any senior
executives in BKC to write the letter for which he took responsibility,
and
that he was authorised by BKC to write it.
<P>

326   	On this issue, as appears immediately from a reading of
the answers, Mr Miolla's evidence was totally unsatisfactory.  I
do not accept
for one moment that he was neither thinking carefully enough nor did not make
the connection in his mind.  One of the
major topics of discussion was the
position so far as Shell was concerned and it is unthinkable, so far as I am
concerned, that a
person with the knowledge and intelligence of Mr Miolla would
have overlooked this matter.  It is also unthinkable, in my view, that
Mr
Miolla would not have paid careful regard to ensuring that HJPL was told by BKC
that which BKC wished it to be told, namely that
the negotiations with Shell
were still proceeding on the same basis.  In my view, the proper explanation of
BKC's conduct was that
it was seeking to ensure that nothing was changed, at
that stage, because whilst BKC considered that Shell would agree to proceed
with it to the exclusion of HJPL, there was no finality in that regard and BKC
wished to achieve finality before advising HJPL of
Shell's attitude to it.
Further, and more reprehensibly from a commercial point of view, I am satisfied
that BKC, through Messrs
Miolla and Hothorn, were deliberately diverting HJPL's
attention from Mobil, to make BKC's position with Shell the more attractive,
and in the knowledge that HJPL would be excluded from that position.
Therefore, not only did BKC fail to advise HJPL of the true
position, but, in
my opinion, it actively misled it about that matter for its own benefit and in
circumstances where it was under
an obligation to advise HJPL of Shell's
attitude and, if it was in agreement with Shell's position, to inform HJPL of
that fact.
 I have no doubt that Mr Fitzjohn and Mr Miolla actively engaged in
this conduct, which not only constituted a failure to conform
with basic
commercial morality but, and perhaps there is no real distinction between the
two in the circumstances of this case, also
constituted a breach of fiduciary
duty. 
<P>

327   	On 5 April 1995, Mr Power sent a facsimile transmission
to Messrs Fitzjohn, Miolla, Hothorn and Horowitz in relation to the
agenda
items for the video conference with Shell, which included the need for
communication between Shell and HJPL about the former's
intention to develop
co-branded sites itself, and the question of Shell's request for a right of
first refusal.  Mr Miolla acknowledged
that the agenda proceeded on the
assumption that Shell or its licensees would be BKC's franchisees at Shell
sites, and he did not
recall any conversations between 21 March 1995 and 5
April 1995 with any of BKC's representatives, which indicated that that
assumption
was incorrect.  Thus, BKC was pursuing its relationship with Shell
to the exclusion of HJPL.  In the end so much was not really in
issue, BKC's
position being that it was entitled to do so in its own commercial interests
and without regard to the arrangement with
HJPL.  The video conference took
place on 6 April 1995 during which BKC and Shell agreed to establish a
bipartite test based on seven
new co-branded sites.  This threw up the basic
issue between the parties.  BKC considered that its negotiations and activities
with
HJPL in relation to Shell created no rights or obligations, save for those
enshrined in the Tripartite Test Agreement.  That was
its basic submission.
HJPL submitted that as the venture was proceeding the conduct of the parties
gave rise to fiduciary duties,
which precluded BKC from doing anything to
subvert the likelihood of the longer term arrangement going forward.  It
submitted that
in so far as BKC did act in a way which put that position in
jeopardy, at least without having terminated the arrangements, it breached
that
fiduciary duty.  In summarising the conclusions reached during that video
conference in his facsimile transmission, Mr Power
said that the communication
to HJPL "next week" would signal "that the result of the twelve month test is
likely to be that Shell
will enter the BKC system as franchisee operator on its
own sites, essentially precluding HJ as franchisee opportunity.  HJ has been
offered the opportunity to have their capital position reimbursed by BKC and
this offer is still open".  This made clear, if that
was necessary by that
stage, that BKC had abandoned HJPL in consequence of negotiations into which it
had entered with Shell and
behind HJPL's back.  This was so notwithstanding
BKC's statements to HJPL that the longer term arrangements with Shell and HJPL
would
continue.  The entry into the bipartite Test Agreement, without HJPL's
knowledge, was further evidence of BKC's abandonment of HJPL
in relation to the
longer term arrangement.
<P>

328   	It was agreed between BKC and Shell that a right of first
refusal was "prudent and reasonable", and both agreed to advise
HJPL
independently that Shell did not require it to provide services but would deal
directly with BKC.
<P>

329   	Mr Fitzjohn accepted that the consequences of the video
conference made it imperative for him to disclose what had evolved
between
Shell and BKC to HJPL as soon as possible, it being apparent that that
disclosure was likely to lead to confrontation with
HJPL.  Mr Miolla saw the
opportunity with Shell as being a large business one.  He agreed BKC never
sought to discourage Shell from
adopting the course of seeking to exclude HJPL
and that Shell's intention to develop the number of restaurants contemplated
would
make it difficult for any other franchisee to embark upon large scale
expansion, thus making unlikely the ability of HJPL to introduce
Mobil.  He
also agreed that as at the date of the video conference, Mr Power probably
regarded Shell's position of going ahead without
HJPL as a very desirable
position for BKC.
<P>

330   	Mr Power was aware that the parallel test, if it
proceeded successfully, would have limited HJPL's access to sites, that
there
was no suggestion that HJPL could service restaurants being run under a
bipartite test between BKC and Shell, and that that
proposed test would take
into account four months' work, information concerning the operations of West
Terrace site and the work
done by BKC and HJPL in the preceding year in
inspecting and evaluating sites. 
<P>

331   	On 10 April 1995, Mr Miolla circulated a draft of the
Test and eventual Development Agreement with Shell, and the current
form of
draft letter to be sent by Mr Fitzjohn to Mr Cowin setting out Shell's
position.  Mr Fitzjohn offered no explanation why
the letter was not sent to Mr
Cowin on 10 April 1995, and Mr Miolla agreed there was absolutely no excuse for
not having notified
Mr Cowin immediately after the video conference, and:-
<P>

"Q. And it would be grossly misleading, having regard to what happened at the
video conference, to seek to discourage Mr Cowin from
dealing with Mobil
without informing him of the position as it emerged following that conference;
correct?
<P>

A. Yes, I would say yes."
<P>

This was further evidence of the commercially disgraceful way in which, in my
opinion, BKC was conducting itself in relation to
HJPL.
<P>

332   	In sending the documents to Shell on 17 April 1995, Mr
Miolla referred to Shell's request for a right of first refusal, which
he said
would have to be worked out having regard to obligations to other franchisees
and:-
<P>

"It's our understanding that this new test will run simultaneously with the
existing three party test involving HJPL, but that you
are willing to discuss
withdrawal by HJPL from the existing three party test if HJPL is reluctant to
compromise. David Fitzjohn will
be speaking with Jack Cowin this week to
communicate your current preference to become a direct franchisee of BKC and
the related
decision to begin a two party test of this arrangement.  David will
also be communicating your input regarding the appropriate trade
name and our
mutual concern regarding the ability of HJPL to serve as an effective provider
of support services for restaurants run
directly by Shell.  David will call you
or Jo Farnik with a report on that conversation and Jack's feelings about
continuing with
the existing HJPL run sites."
<P>

Mr Miolla agreed that by then it was clear that Shell or its franchisees would
operate all restaurants if the long-term agreement
came to fruition.
<P>

333   	Notwithstanding the apparent intention to advise Mr Cowin
in mid-April, on 18 April 1995 Mr Power had a discussion with Mr
Montgomery the
contents of which he communicated to Messrs Fitzjohn, Hothorn, Giresi and
Miolla.  Mr Power reported Mr Montgomery's
understanding of discussions between
Mr Cowin and his bankers and the following recommendations:-
<P>

"JM recommendation is that now may not be the right time to call as the
reception may not be positive at all; however we both believe
that to wait much
longer will see the situation deteriorate further ...
<P>

We believe that the DF call later this week should be cancelled and in lieu, a
communication from BK (either CH or DF) occur, focused
on the positioning and
timing of a formal BK/HJ strategy review session in Sydney with DF and CH plus
RM and/or MG also in attendance."
<P>

This made clear that Mr Montgomery was aware that BKC intended to advise Mr
Cowin of Shell's position and, hence, that Mr Montgomery
was aware of it.
There can be no suggestion that he told Mr Cowin about it, indeed the statement
Mr Power attributed to him negated
any possible inference that he did.  Thus
BKC was dealing with Mr Montgomery on the basis that he would be the recipient
of information
of obvious commercial importance to Mr Cowin, which he would not
communicate to him, and also on the basis that he was prepared to
advise BKC of
what he perceived to be its best approach in the light of the information he
received from it, and the information
he had in consequence of his trusted
position as a senior employee of HJPL.  This situation only has to be stated to
destroy the
quite lame reasons sought to be advanced by Messrs Fitzjohn and
Miolla for their understanding of the way in which Mr Montgomery
was acting.
Although Mr Montgomery was not called, it is difficult to imagine any
commercially acceptable reason for his conduct,
and that of BKC was, in my
opinion, commercially reprehensible.  Not only was BKC acting behind HJPL's
back in its negotiations with
Shell, but it was utilising advice from Mr
Montgomery based on information it had furnished to him in confidence, knowing
him to
be a trusted employee of HJPL, to formulate its strategy against HJPL.
That was bad enough.  But it became much worse when it is
realised that all
this was taking place in gross dereliction of the fiduciary duties I am
satisfied BKC owed to HJPL.
<P>

334   	Mr Power accepted that the "we", being the first word of
the last quoted paragraph, was a reference to Mr Montgomery and
himself, and
that he accepted Mr Montgomery's suggestion that Mr Fitzjohn should not proceed
at that stage.  So much for Mr Fitzjohn's
evidence that Mr Montgomery's advice
was not heeded.  Mr Fitzjohn said he did not think his reason for not calling
Mr Cowin was that
he was acting on Mr Montgomery's advice, and Mr Miolla said
he did not know whether the proposed call from Mr Fitzjohn to Mr Cowin
was
cancelled because of that advice.  In my opinion, there can be no doubt that Mr
Montgomery's advice was the reason, and in so
far as Messrs Fitzjohn and Miolla
expressed any doubts about the matter I totally reject their evidence.
<P>

335   	Mr Bathurst submitted that the overwhelming likelihood
was that Mr Fitzjohn's telephone call was cancelled on the basis of
that advice
because there was no other plausible explanation for the delay of a further
month.  He sought to reinforce this view
by noting the change between the draft
letter of 10 April 1995 and the final version of 15 May 1995 by the addition of
the final
paragraph, which it was submitted "echoed" the advice of Mr
Montgomery:-
<P>

"I think we're approaching a cross-road and that we need to meet in person to
discuss strategic issues in more detail.  I am willing
to come to Sydney to see
you and I would suggest that we also have Roy Blauer attend."
<P>

These submissions reinforce the views I have expressed.
<P>

336   	The difficulty confronting BKC on this issue is that if,
contrary to the view to which I have come, the proper inference
to draw is that
BKC did not accept Mr Montgomery's advice, then it is that BKC delayed for some
basically unexplained reason at a
time when both Mr Fitzjohn and Mr Miolla
clearly took the view that the appropriate course was to advise Mr Cowin.  I
say "basically
unexplained" because some attempts were made to explain the
delay by reason of matters such as difficulty of communication and the
bringing
on of a confrontation, which reasons I reject. The failure to advise Mr Cowin
was commercially discreditable, because, on
any view, the stage had been
reached when, if BKC had been acting in a commercially proper manner it would
have advised HJPL of the
situation.  In my opinion, the proper inference to
draw is that BKC did not advise Mr Cowin because of the information received
from
Mr Montgomery.  The reason for adopting that course was because it was
obviously anticipated that Mr Montgomery was in possession
of information
concerning Mr Cowin's probable attitude, which made it inappropriate to do so
and of which information BKC was prepared
to take advantage.
<P>

337   	Thereafter, progress was made between BKC and Shell and,
on 15 May 1995, after a telephone conversation with Mr Cowin, Mr
Fitzjohn sent
the letter to him advising of Shell's position.  Mr Fitzjohn offered various
explanations relating to his busyness
and travel arrangements for not
communicating earlier with Mr Cowin.  I reject these attempted explanations.
There were various versions
of this conversation. I prefer that of Mr Cowin
which, in my opinion, is substantially corroborated by Mr Miolla, and which
accorded
with the probabilities.  If the conversation took place in the way for
which Mr Fitzjohn contended it was virtually meaningless.
 I do not accept Mr
Fitzjohn's evidence as to why he delayed communicating with Mr Cowin.  He was
able to communicate world-wide
through the most basic and sophisticated
electronic equipment very quickly and did so, as hundreds of tendered documents
show.  He
did so from many parts of the world to many other parts of the world
accommodating time differences if need be.  He did so particularly
when he was
travelling, as he frequently was.  The same position applied to Mr Cowin. It is
nonsense to suggest that either of the
reasons advanced provided a valid
reason, let alone an excuse.  I think his final statement that he had no idea
what caused the delay
was inaccurate, for I am sure he knew what the reason was
but was not prepared to divulge it, that being a belated attempt to extricate
himself from the obvious difficulty of asserting that the reasons were busyness
and travelling, whilst not disclosing the true reason.
<P>

338   	In relation to the 15 May 1995 letter, Mr Fitzjohn agreed
that the use of the word "never" in the first paragraph was inappropriate
and
wrong; that the third paragraph made no reference to the date of the conference
call with the implication that the Shell communication
was a recent occurrence
and, even before that had occurred there had been an assertion, in relation to
the Burger King brand being
used by Shell in the Eastern States, of
"unsolicited input without any encouragement from anyone at BKC".  He said that
he did not
think that was false at the time. In relation to the second numbered
paragraph on page 2 concerning HJPL's provision of services
to Shell, Mr
Fitzjohn said that was misleading as he knew by then that Shell had indicated a
strong preference not to be supported
by HJPL.  There were, accordingly,
significant matters in the letter which were conceded to be wrong, and which, I
am satisfied,
were known to be wrong when it was written.  Thus, when Mr
Fitzjohn finally reached the position of advising Mr Cowin he did so in
terms
which lacked frankness and veracity.  This, in my opinion, was a continuation
of BKC's wholly discreditable conduct in relation
to this issue.  Messrs
Fitzjohn, Miolla and Power were all involved in it, the first two being very
senior officers of BKC.
<P>

339   	Mr Cowin responded to the letter on 2 June 1995 in robust
terms and, it was submitted, "with a clear and strong rebuttal
of each of the
points made in" it.  On 29 June 1995, Mr Fitzjohn replied in circumstances
which avoided answering the specific matters
raised by Mr Cowin.  
<P>

340   	Mr Bathurst's submissions then turned to the success of
the tripartite test within the terms contemplated by the parties.
 He submitted
that in a report to Shell's head office of 16 May 1995, Mr Kuehne, the senior
Shell executive involved in the project,
advised that sales growth had been
strong at the West Terrace site operated by HJPL, that fuel and shop sales had
improved at that
site, and that the success of the concept was "excellent"
making it suitable for twelve - twenty per cent of Shell's network.  Further,
the notes of a meeting between Messrs Cowin and Butler of HJPL, and Messrs
Farnik, Mummery and Plaisted of Shell, on 15 April 1995,
which were prepared by
Shell, recorded that BKC was pleased with the success of the HJPL
arrangement.
<P>

341   	The test sites operated by HJPL at Kingsway and West
Terrace had generated significant profits for both HJPL and Shell, and
the
success of the arrangement, from the perspective of BKC and Shell, is to be
inferred from the fact that each entered into a bipartite
arrangement
contemplating the development of further sites, and that Shell subsequently
opened "Hungry Jack's" restaurants at fourteen
sites.  It was submitted that
the success of the arrangement from HJPL's perspective could be inferred from
its wish to continue
to operate the Kingsway and West Terrace sites and, under
the terms of the settlement of these proceedings between HJPL and Shell,
HJPL
has sought and Shell has granted extended rights to occupy those sites.
Finally, it was submitted that the inference of the
arrangement's success may
be more confidently drawn as BKC has not sought to lead evidence from its
executives to suggest that the
trial was unsuccessful and has not called any
Shell witnesses to give evidence to that effect.  In all these circumstances, I
consider
that the proper reference is that had BKC insisted on the tripartite
joint venture going forward, Shell would have acquiesced.  That,
in turn, tends
to negate any suggestion that there was no appropriate causal connection
between the alleged breaches by BKC and any
damages caused to HJPL.
<P>

342   	Mr Bathurst submitted, Tp.3880, that BKC breached its
fiduciary obligations by encouraging Shell to go ahead without HJPL's
involvement, and by taking the benefit of the service royalties from the Shell
restaurants to the exclusion of HJPL.  Thirdly, it
was submitted, that there
was a breach by withholding that negotiations were taking place with Shell
behind HJPL's back.  In my opinion,
the evidence establishes each of these
breaches.
<P>

343   	Mr Bathurst dealt with the assertion that the agreement
between the parties was covered by the Test Site Agreement, his submissions
being that the Test Site Agreement did not cover the contemplated larger
agreement in relation to a possible seventy sites, was not
entered into in
respect of test sites until either February or March 1995, and, as a matter of
construction, was not concerned with
the present points.  He dealt nextly with
the assertion by BKC that there was separate legal representation for each
party, and submitted
that that, of itself, did not tend to show that a
fiduciary obligation did not exist, nor did it absolve BKC from the
consequences
of its breaches of fiduciary duty.
<P>

344   	Mr Bathurst submitted that there existed a joint venture
or a proposed joint venture between, inter alia, BKC and Shell under
which,
among other things, HJPL was to open test stores at Shell service stations at
Kingsway, Melbourne and West Terrace, Adelaide
and at least one other site to
be agreed; the operation of Burger King restaurants other than at the test
sites would be conducted
by HJPL or such third party franchisees as it might
nominate after discussion with BKC; HJPL would operate most of the Burger King
restaurants opened at Shell service stations after the conclusion of the tests;
and HJPL would provide services to all of the Burger
King restaurants opened as
part of the joint venture.  I should add, and so much seemed to be accepted by
Mr Bathurst, that it was
agreed that the further relationship should only go
forward if the Test Site Agreement proved "successful", although, at all
relevant
times, the parties proceeded on the basis that that would, in all
probability, occur.  However, Mr Bathurst added that for the purposes
of his
submissions the fiduciary duty and the obligations imposed by it arose at the
time the arrangement was entered into and implemented
and remained until it was
terminated, so that there was no need for the Test Site Agreement to be
successful before those obligations
arose or were breached, but rather that
they were in place at all material times.
<P>

345   	The submissions continued that the joint venture or
proposed joint venture existed prior to the entry into the Test Site
Agreement
and, by reason of the joint venture or proposed joint venture, BKC owed
fiduciary duties and obligations to HJPL, which
required that it not take
steps, either itself or in conjunction with Shell, to exclude HJPL from the
development, operation and/or
servicing of Burger King restaurants at Shell
service stations in Australia.  This showed, conformably with the pleading,
that there
was a potentiality for a wider ambit of operations than the Test
Site Agreement.  The submission continued that at the least those
duties
required that BKC and Shell must not negotiate secretly to exclude HJPL from
the proposed venture.  Alternatively, it was
submitted, the dealings between
HJPL and BKC, so far as they concerned negotiations with Shell, were directed
to the formation of
a joint venture between them to establish and operate
Burger King restaurants at Shell service stations in Australia, and that BKC
owed HJPL fiduciary duties and contractual duties of good faith in relation to
that matter.
<P>

346   	The submission was that from March 1994 there existed
either a venture by HJPL and BKC to deal jointly with Shell for the
promotion
of a long-term relationship with Shell through the medium of a test site
agreement; and/or a venture by HJPL, BKC and Shell
to undertake the
establishment and operation of a series of restaurants under the terms of a
Test Site Agreement to be executed in
due course with a view to establishing a
long-term relationship, which would involve Shell's establishing restaurants at
service
stations utilising the Burger King system and operated or serviced by
HJPL.  This led, prior to the execution of the Test Site Agreement,
to HJPL's
being expected to and in fact expending time, money and effort for the benefit
of itself and BKC, and taking the role of
conducting the development of the
proposal on behalf of each, it being apparent to BKC that the sole purpose of
participation in
the activity was the chance of a long-term business
relationship with Shell.  It was submitted that the failure to finally
negotiate
detailed arrangements heightened the element of trust and confidence,
which existed between HJPL and BKC.  The submission continued
that the subject
matter of the arrangement between them was the opportunity to develop a
long-term relationship with Shell, which
would be to the benefit of both, each
being dependent on the other to convert that opportunity into reality because
BKC had the entitlement
to the relevant system and intellectual property rights
and HJPL had the necessary infrastructure.
<P>

Mr Oslington's Submissions In Relation To The Shell Issue
<P>

347   	Mr Oslington submitted that the only commercial
arrangement into which the parties entered was a tripartite test agreement
in
respect of a limited number of sites, which was documented in the Tripartite
Test Agreement entered into in February or March
1995.  The submission was that
the terms of this agreement not only negated any other agreement, but also the
existence of any fiduciary
duty.  In my opinion, this submission should not be
accepted.  Not only was the Tripartite Test Agreement not entered into until
well after the events giving rise to the fiduciary duty for which Mr Bathurst
contended, but it did not, on its proper construction,
have the consequences
for which Mr Oslington contended.  In my view, Mr Bathurst's submissions on the
construction issue should be
accepted.
<P>

348   	Mr Oslington submitted that there was nothing in the
relationships between BKC, HJPL and Shell, which prevented BKC from
entering
into commercial arrangements with Shell independently of HJPL.  This submission
depends on whether a fiduciary relationship
existed and, if it did, its range.
He submitted, in this regard, that the relationship between the various parties
was not one which
could give rise to fiduciary duties or obligations because
they were essentially commercial relationships governed by contracts.
 Further,
having regard to the history of the dealings between HJPL and BKC, particularly
as evidenced by the 1990 agreements, that
these were not shown to be the
elements of confidence and trust upon which fiduciary relations are based.
<P>

349   	Mr Oslington submitted that the proper analysis of the
position was that the parties intended to enter into the Tripartite
Test
Agreement, which they did, and which they performed in circumstances where
there were no other obligations between them such
as to prevent BKC and Shell
from entering into the Bipartite Test Agreement or, indeed, any other
commercial arrangement they saw
fit.  The submission continued that the longer
term arrangement, which was in mind, was wholly subject to the success of the
Tripartite
Test Agreement and that it was only if that was successful that the
parties would decide whether and on what terms they would proceed
further.  He
said that this was particularly so having regard to what he submitted was Mr
Cowin's reluctance to enter into any long-term
arrangement.
<P>

350   	Mr Oslington submitted that there were two further broad
issues relating to Shell, the first being the joint venture claim
in relation
to which he said HJPL had abandoned an attempt to prove any damages flowing
from it, and that the evidence about the
history of the Shell relationship
seemed to be relied on as relevant to the bad faith issue.  Secondly, the issue
whether Shell was
introduced by HJPL in respect of restaurants at its service
stations at Mackay, Mudgeeraba, Granard Road, Campbelltown, Jacana, East
Ringwood and Westlakes.  He submitted that HJPL's claim was that it introduced
Shell as a franchisee in respect of those restaurants
and claimed the service
royalty pursuant to clause 10.3 of the Service Agreement as damages.  
<P>

351   	Clause 10.3 provided:-
<P>

"Royalties - BKC shall cause to be paid to Hungry Jack's one-half of the
royalty received from designated Franchisees other than
Hungry Jack's.  BKC
contemplates a total royalty fee from designated Franchisees other than Hungry
Jack's of 5% of gross sales. 
Such payment to Hungry Jack's shall be made on a
monthly basis as long as Hungry Jack's is providing the services under this
Agreement.
 BKC may change the royalty rate for designated Franchisees other
than Hungry Jack's."
<P>

A "designated franchisee" was defined as:-
<P>

"Hungry Jack's, franchisees of BKC introduced by Hungry Jack's to BKC and such
other franchisees of BKC as BKC may nominate from
time to time."
<P>

Mr Oslington submitted that the factual issue was whether Shell was a
franchisee of BKC introduced by HJPL to it.
<P>

352   	Mr Oslington's written submissions traced the evidence of
Mr Cowin in relation to HJPL's dealings with Shell, and he submitted
that it
was apparent from paragraph 9(b) of Mr Mazzone's statement that HJPL was trying
to lease food outlets at Shell sites and
not discussing a proposal with Shell
that it become a franchisee.  A similar type of situation was sought to be
negotiated in respect
of the Westgate Bridge site and the Kingsway site,
involving the possibility of HJPL leasing food outlets.  It was not until late
1993 or early 1994 that Mr Cowin learned of the proposal for Shell to become a
franchisee and, it was submitted, neither Mr Cowin
nor any other HJPL witness
claimed to have initiated those discussions.
<P>

353   	Mr Oslington then considered the discussions, which
proceeded between different officers of Shell from those dealing with
HJPL,
between BKC and Shell.  By the latter part of 1993 those officers of Shell had
approached Mr Jones about the potential of entering
the Sydney market, and the
matter was proceeding, at least as between Shell and BKC, on the basis that an
opportunity was being presented
to BKC to introduce the Burger King brand into
the New South Wales market.
<P>

354   	On 20 October 1993, Shell sent BKC a draft letter of
intent to become a franchisee of its, and, on 9 November 1993, an amended
draft
was furnished to Shell.  On 29 November 1993, Mr Miolla prepared a draft Test
Agreement, which predicated Shell's becoming
a franchisee, but discussions,
thus far, between BKC and Shell were on the basis that that relationship would
be established without
the introduction, knowledge, intervention or assistance
of HJPL.
<P>

355   	I consider that this analysis, at least to the end of
1993, is correct.  The question that has to be addressed, however,
is what
occurred in early 1994.  Mr Oslington placed emphasis upon Mr Montgomery's
notes of the meeting of 29 March 1994, which Mr
Mazzone said recorded the
substance of what Mr Cowin had said at that meeting, namely that the purpose of
the meeting was:-
<P>

"... to focus more specifically on how a relationship between Shell and BK/HJ
could be progressed and put into operation on a test
basis as soon as possible
in order to establish in the first instance compatibility of companies and
systems and to look at guidelines
and principles for a larger scale and
long-term arrangement between the parties which could be implemented on a
national basis."
<P>

356   	Mr Oslington submitted that such statements by Mr Cowin
were not consistent with his wanting to commit to a long-term arrangement
"at
that stage".  However, I do not regard that statement by Mr Cowin, which Mr
Oslington seemed to accept as reflecting the true
situation, as derogating from
HJPL's case on this issue.  It is completely consistent, in my view, with the
aim of the parties that
if the test arrangement was successful it would provide
a basis for a long-term relationship and, whilst the test site arrangements
were being implemented, steps were being taken to put in place such a
relationship on the assumption that in all probability they
would be
successful.
<P>

357   	Mr Oslington submitted that Shell became a franchisee of
the restaurants in respect of which service royalty was claimed
through its
discussions with BKC in 1993, which ultimately led to the tripartite test
agreement and, subsequently, the bipartite
test agreement running in parallel
with it.  He reinforced this submission by stating that it was not until 19
July 1994 that it
was decided to make HJPL a party to the Test Site Agreement,
the previous drafts of that agreement not having mentioned HJPL.  In
all these
circumstances, he submitted, Shell was not a "designated franchisee" in respect
of those restaurants.
<P>

358   	In response to the reliance on the terms of the Service
Agreement, Mr Bathurst submitted in reply that the amendment to that
agreement,
effected by clause 10A on 12 December 1991, provided:-
<P>

"10A.1	Each party must ensure that each franchise agreement entered into with a
Third Party Franchisee (a `Franchise Agreement')
provides for the Third Party
Franchisee to pay:
<P>

(a)	to BKC an initial franchisee fee and a monthly royalty on gross receipts
received by the Third Party Franchisee arising out
of the Third Party
Franchisee's operation of a Burger King restaurant (`Monthly Franchise
Royalty'); and
<P>

(b)	to Hungry Jack's an initial service fee of 1.5 times the initial franchisee
fee and a monthly service royalty (`Service Royalty')
equal to the Monthly
Franchise Royalty."
<P>

359   	Clause 10B.2 provided that BKC may require HJPL to cease
providing services to a Third Party Franchisee if it was not introduced
to BKC
by HJPL without cause by giving ninety days' written notice to HJPL; and, in
respect of any other Third Party Franchisee,
only if HJPL failed to provide
services to the Third Party Franchisee and failed to rectify that breach within
thirty days of receiving
notice from BKC or the Third Party Franchisee
requiring it to do so.
<P>

360   	He submitted that the effect of these clauses was that
HJPL was entitled to receive a monthly service royalty from Shell
of fifty per
cent of the total monthly service royalty payable as Shell was a third party
franchisee.
<P>

361   	Mr Bathurst's submissions continued that this raised two
issues, namely the meaning to be attributed to the word "introduced"
and,
whether on an analysis of the facts, Shell was "introduced" by HJPL.  The
significance of these questions was, notwithstanding
that there had been no
purported termination of the arrangements, that if HJPL had not "introduced"
Shell, they could be terminated
without cause by giving ninety days' written
notice to HJPL, but if Shell had been "introduced" by HJPL the right to
terminate was
far more restricted.  The right of termination reflected on the
possible entitlement to equitable compensation.
<P>

362   	Mr Bathurst submitted that BKC offered no explanation as
to the meaning of the word "introduced", and appears to have assumed
that it
only referred to conduct which led to the grant of a successful franchise
application.  Whilst conceding that may be one
application of the meaning of
the term, he submitted that the better approach was to determine whether HJPL
was the "effective cause"
of the formation of a Franchise Agreement, which
included drawing to BKC's attention the prospect of opening "Hungry Jack's"
restaurants
on Shell service station sites.  By adopting that approach, he
submitted, it removed the ability of Shell or BKC to "capriciously
deny" HJPL
the benefit of the introduction by later choosing to negotiate directly with
each other.
<P>

363   	He submitted that the evidence established that HJPL
directly introduced Shell to BKC, by bringing its interest in the Burger
King
System to BKC's attention.  He noted that Mr Jones had conceded that he was
aware prior to 1993 that HJPL was dealing with Shell
in relation to the
Westgate site in Melbourne; that he acknowledged that it was possible that late
in 1993 he had become aware that
HJPL was negotiating with Shell for the
establishment of a number of restaurants at Shell service stations; and that
certainly by
September 1993 Mr Jones was aware of HJPL's previous dealings with
Shell by reference to his evidence in which he claimed that Shell
had indicated
it was not happy with them.  From this Mr Bathurst submitted that "at the
least", HJPL had indirectly introduced Shell
to BKC by drawing the Burger King
System to its attention prior to BKC's first dealings with Shell, and he
referred to the following
facts:-
<P>

(a)	In September 1989, Mr Cowin had written to various oil companies, including
Shell;
<P>

(b)	during 1990 and 1991, HJPL participated in discussions with Shell
concerning the possibility of "Hungry Jack's restaurants at
the Westgate site
in Melbourne"; and
<P>

(c)	during 1993 and 1994, the discussions between HJPL and Shell expanded to
include the possibility of the Kingsway site, which
later became a "test site"
under the tripartite arrangement.
<P>

364   	The matters to which I have referred are significant not
only in themselves, but also because of the claim by HJPL to have
the equitable
compensation, to which it has asserted it is entitled, measured by reference to
the service royalty.  As I have said,
Mr Oslington's submissions proceeded on
the basis that clause 10.3 of the Service Agreement governed the situation,
which was also
based on an introduction. Clauses 10A and B appear to me to
change, or, perhaps more accurately, reinforce HJPL's position in this
regard,
and, whilst Mr Bathurst raised these matters in reply, they were obviously
responsive to Mr Oslington's submission that clause
10.3 governed the
situation.  Mr Oslington's response to these matters, as I understood it and,
perhaps, impliedly, was that HJPL
had not introduced Shell.  The consequence of
that would be that the rights under the 1991 agreement could be terminated by
the giving
of 90 days' notice without cause being shown.
<P>

365   	Mr Bathurst relied upon the analogy of an introduction by
a real estate agent and, thereby, upon the general approach that
the word
"introduced" should be given a wide meaning to preclude parties seeking to
avoid the fact of introduction for their own
financial benefit.  In my opinion,
this is the appropriate approach to the construction of that word.  The factual
question then
is whether there was sufficient activity by HJPL to justify a
finding that it "introduced" Shell to the concept.
<P>

366   	On Mr Oslington's submissions it is clear that there were
discussions between HJPL and Shell well before there were discussions
between
BKC and Shell, the initial BKC presentation not being made until mid-1993.
Even accepting, as I think it is correct to do,
that those discussions related
to leasing, although that was certainly qualified by the discussion Mr Cowin
had in December 1989
with Shell in which there was a suggestion to open one
restaurant to test the concept of Shell's changing from "Tuckers" to "Hungry
Jack's", I think within the concept of "introduction" to which I have just
referred that that was sufficient.  The concept to which
the agreement was
referring was one of introduction, not negotiation of terms, and the evidence
satisfies me that HJPL was an effective
cause, and probably the effective
cause, of Shell's becoming interested in adopting the "Hungry Jack's" brand
and, accordingly, becoming
interested in dealing with BKC.  The word
"introduction" would be deprived of all relevant commercial meaning if one then
had to
trace through the negotiations and to conclude that as the final form of
arrangement between the parties was different from that
originally
contemplated, there was, accordingly, no "introduction". 
<P>

Mr Oslington's Submissions On The Tripartite Test Agreement
<P>

367   	Mr Oslington submitted that the only relevant contractual
relationship was the Tripartite Test Agreement, which was the product
of
careful consideration by "three large commercial organisations and their
lawyers".  It was the only agreement with Shell to which
HJPL was a party, and
clause 16 stated that it contained the entire agreement and understanding
between the parties on everything
connected with the subject matter of the
agreement, and that it superseded and merged any prior agreement or
understanding on anything
connected with that subject matter.  Clause 16 also
acknowledged that each party entered into the agreement without relying on any
representation by any other party, and clause 19 provided that variations were
not effective unless in writing.
<P>

368   	I have referred to Mr Bathurst's response to these
submissions and to my view that the agreement does not preclude the existence
of a joint venture relationship between the parties from approximately March
1994 of the type I have described.  In my opinion, and
I shall consider the
authorities in a moment, the facts give rise to a sufficient relationship to
establish  fiduciary duties, notwithstanding
that there was no concluded
agreement and that the entry into the long-term agreement was dependent upon
the success of the Tripartite
Test Agreement.  In the meantime, the fiduciary
duties impacted on the relationships the parties had established.
<P>

369   	Mr Oslington placed reliance on the evidence of HJPL's
then solicitor, Mr Peter Kemp, at Tpp.973-974.  In my opinion, Mr
Kemp's
evidence does not negate the existence of circumstances giving rise to a
fiduciary relationship.  Rather, his understanding
was consistent with the
existence of facts, which would give rise to one.  Nor do I consider that it is
any answer to HJPL's contentions
that it did not want to commit to a long-term
relationship until it could form a view, as a result of the test, whether it
worked.
 The parties were working towards a long-term agreement, provided the
test was successful, and, in pursuance of that, HJPL was, to
the knowledge of
BKC and Shell, expending time and money.  No party had any intention to enter
into a long-term relationship at that
time, but the arrangements into which
they entered created, in the view to which I have come, fiduciary obligations
between them,
which were breached by BKC and Shell prior to the entry into the
Tripartite Test Agreement.  This was reinforced by the undoubted
fact,
established by the evidence, that all parties considered the Tripartite Test
Agreement would be successful. 
<P>

370   	Mr Oslington submitted that by June 1995 HJPL had already
decided that there was not enough money in the arrangement contemplated
by the
Test Site Agreement with Shell.  He referred to Mr Butler's having told the
banks on 29 May 1995 that there was insufficient
profit in the trial of Shell
outlets and that a decision had been taken to proceed on a franchise basis,
which would entail Shell
being the franchisee of the Hungry Jack's outlet.  I
do not see that this is inconsistent with the long-term arrangement the parties
had in mind.  As Mr Oslington's submissions made clear, the terms of that
arrangement had not been worked out and there is no reason,
so far as I can
see, why they should not have been put into operation in the manner to which Mr
Butler referred.  In the same vein
Mr Oslington noted that HJPL did not develop
further test sites, which he submitted was consistent with its taking the view
that
the arrangements being explored with Shell through the test were
unsatisfactory so far as it was concerned and consistent with what
Mr Butler
told the banks in May 1995.  However, for the reasons I have given, I do not
see that the change in the arrangements is
a relevant factor.  In other words
it was never finally decided that any long-term arrangement should be carried
out consistently
with the Test Site Agreement, rather than by way of
franchises.
<P>

371   	In his further submissions Mr Oslington put that the
parties were not in a fiduciary relationship and he referred to the
statement
of Gibbs CJ in Hospital Products Limited v United States Surgical Corporation
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 156 CLR 41</a> at pp.72-73 warning against importing fiduciary obligations
into a commercial agreement, particularly one entered into by parties
at arm's
length and on an equal footing.  I shall refer to the authorities in a
moment.
<P>

372   	At a factual level Mr Oslington relied upon the
Tripartite Test Agreement which, if I may say so with respect, was not relevant
to the fiduciary obligations for which HJPL was contending, to what was
contemplated under that agreement, and to the ability of
BKC and Shell to enter
into separate agreements unfettered by the arrangements with a view to a
long-term agreement.  It is, at this
point, that I do not accept Mr Oslington's
submissions on this aspect.  My reason is that whilst the parties were
obviously negotiating,
the circumstances in which they were doing so, including
the activities in which they were engaging, precluded them from acting contrary
to those arrangements and the mutually held expectations that, in all
probability, a longer term agreement would be reached, unless
and until those
arrangements were terminated.  The position, as I see it, which the evidence
disclosed, was one of sinister simplicity.
 Three parties were purportedly
working together to achieve a result, which would be for the financial benefit
of all and to which
each was making a relevant commercial contribution.  Two of
those parties, unknown to the third, were engaging in their own private
negotiations to achieve substantially the same objective but to the exclusion
of the third party.  The issue is whether all these
matters, particularly when
taken in combination with the misleading conduct in which BKC was engaging to
encourage HJPL to continue
with the arrangement, with the dissuading of it from
investigating an arrangement with Mobil and with failing to advise it of its
dealings with Shell, gave rise to a fiduciary duty and its breach.  In my view,
it did.
<P>

The Fiduciary Duty
<P>

373   	The first question is whether there was a relationship
between BKC, HJPL and Shell or between BKC and HJPL that gave rise
to fiduciary
obligations.  In Hospital Products Gibbs CJ, in referring to the nature of the
duties owed, said, at p.67:-
<P>

"A person who occupies a fiduciary position may not use that position to gain a
profit or advantage for himself, nor may he obtain
a benefit by entering into a
transaction in conflict with his fiduciary duty, without the informed consent
of the person to whom
he owes the duty."
<P>

374   	At p.68 his Honour said that the authorities contained
much guidance as to the duties, but "provide no comprehensive statement
of the
criteria by reference to which the existence of a fiduciary relationship may be
established".  After referring to a number
of relationships, which created a
fiduciary situation, his Honour said:-
<P>

"There is no reason to suppose that these categories are closed.  However, the
difficulty is to suggest a test by which it may be
determined whether a
relationship, not within one of the accepted categories, is a fiduciary
one."
<P>

He referred to the finding by the Court of Appeal that the relationship existed
where the facts established that "in a particular
matter a person has
undertaken to act in the interests of another and not in his own".
<P>

375   	At p.69 his Honour said:-
<P>

"I doubt if it is fruitful to attempt to make a general statement of the
circumstances in which a fiduciary relationship will be
found to exist.
Fiduciary relations are of different types, carrying different obligations ..
and a test which might seem appropriate
to determine whether a fiduciary
relationship existed for one purpose might be quite inappropriate for another
purpose.  ...  Moreover,
different fiduciary relationships may entail different
consequences, as is shown by the discussion of the respective positions of
a
trustee and a partner in relation to the renewal of a lease: .."
<P>

376   	At p.70 his Honour noted that the fact that the
arrangement between the parties was of a purely commercial kind, and that
they
had dealt at arm's length and on an equal footing, had consistently been
regarded by the High Court as important, if not decisive,
in indicating that no
fiduciary duty arose.
<P>

377   	His Honour, at p.72, considered that the test suggested
by the Court of Appeal was "not inappropriate in the circumstances",
although
he concluded that even if it were applied it was not satisfied because, in his
opinion, the appellant did not undertake
"whether by representation or
contractual provision, to act solely in the interests of USSC and not in its
own interests".  His Honour
also considered that as the arrangements between
the parties were governed by the contract into which they had entered, and
because
it could not be said that it was not intended that the appellant should
profit from the contract, it could not be concluded that
there was a fiduciary
relationship.
<P>

378   	Mason J posed the question as to whether a fiduciary
relationship existed at p.96.  His Honour referred to the accepted fiduciary
relationships, and continued:-
<P>

"The critical feature of these relationships is that the fiduciary undertakes
or agrees to act for or on behalf of or in the interests
of another person in
the exercise of a power or discretion which will affect the interests of that
other person in a legal or practical
sense.  The relationship between the
parties is therefore one which gives the fiduciary a special opportunity to
exercise the power
or discretion to the detriment of that other person who is
accordingly vulnerable to abuse by the fiduciary of his position.  The
expressions `for', `on behalf of', and `in the interests of' signify that the
fiduciary acts in a `representative' character in the
exercise of his
responsibility, to adopt an expression used by the Court of Appeal.
<P>

It is partly because the fiduciary's exercise of the power or discretion can
adversely affect the interests of the person to whom
the duty is owed and
because the latter is at the mercy of the former that the fiduciary comes under
a duty to exercise his power
or discretion in the interests of the person to
whom it is owed .."
<P>

The observations in the second paragraph, as I would understand it, flow from
the relationships described in the first.  As Millett
LJ said in Bristol and
West Building Society v Mathews [1998] 1 Ch 1 at p.17:-
<P>

"A fiduciary is someone who has undertaken to act for or on behalf of another
in a particular matter in circumstances which give
rise to a relationship of
trust and confidence."
<P>

379   	Mason J said that it had never been doubted that
contractual and fiduciary relationships may co-exist between the same parties,
the former regulating their basic rights and liabilities, and the latter:-
<P>

".. if it is to exist at all, must accommodate itself to the terms of the
contract so that it is consistent with, and conforms to,
them.  The fiduciary
relationship cannot be superimposed upon the contract in such a way as to alter
the operation which the contract
was intended to have according to its true
construction."
<P>

380   	His Honour, at pp.97-98, said:-
<P>

"My conclusion that HPI was at liberty to make some business decisions by
reference to its own interests, subject to the obligations
arising under the
best efforts promise and the other terms of the contract express and implied,
presents an overwhelming obstacle
to the existence of the comprehensive
fiduciary relationship found by the Court of Appeal.  This is because HPI's
capacity to make
decisions and take action in some matters by reference to its
own interests is inconsistent with the existence of a general fiduciary
relationship.  However, it does not exclude the existence of a more limited
fiduciary duty for it is well settled that a person may
be a fiduciary in some
activities but not in others .."
<P>

381   	His Honour set out a number of factors, which he
considered relevant in determining whether a fiduciary duty was brought
into
existence in the circumstances of that case.  They included the existence of a
valuable market, the appointment of a party to
take advantage of it, the
leaving to that party of the manner in which the market was to be promoted
subject to express and implied
terms of the contract, the exercise by that
party of that discretion, which provided a special opportunity of acting to the
detriment
of the other, the fact that the distributor was not acting as agent,
the ability of the distributor to affect the supplier's goodwill,
and the
distributor's responsibility to protect and promote the supplier's product
goodwill being subject to the qualification of
reasonableness attached to the
best efforts promise.  Of course, the facts of each case will differ, but the
role played by BKC can
be relevantly equated to various of these situations.
<P>

382   	At p.99 Mason J said:-
<P>

"The classical illustrations of the fiduciary relationship are those in which
the fiduciary is under a duty to act not in his own
interests or solely in his
own interests but in the interests of another or jointly in the interests of
another and himself, eg,
a trustee and a partner.  In the present case the
nature of the distributorship relationship and the best efforts promise with
its
attendant standard of reasonableness necessarily entailed that HPI could
make some business decisions by reference to its financial
interests, without
subordinating them to the promotion of the market for USSC's products, so long
at any rate as HPI did not deliberately
do something, or omit to do something,
for the purpose of destroying or injuring that market."
<P>

383   	His Honour continued:-
<P>

"<u>But entitlement to act in one's own interests is not an answer to the
existence of a fiduciary relationship, if there be an obligation
to act in the
interests of another.  It is that obligation which is the foundation of the
fiduciary relationship, even if it be subject
to qualifications including the
qualification that in some respects the fiduciary is entitled to act by
reference to his own interests</u>.  The fiduciary duty must then accommodate
itself to the relationship between the parties created by their contractual
entitlements.
 An entitlement under the contract to act in the relevant matter
solely by reference to one's own interests will constitute an answer
to an
alleged breach of the fiduciary duty.  The difficulty of deciding under the
contract when the fiduciary is entitled to act
in his own interests is not in
itself a reason for rejecting the existence of a fiduciary relationship, though
it may be an element
in arriving at the conclusion that the person asserting
the relationship has not established that there is any obligation to act
in the
interests of another."  (My emphasis.)
<P>

384   	His Honour referred to "an understandable reluctance to
subject commercial transactions to the equitable doctrine of constructive
trust
and constructive notice" and, at p.100, continued:-
<P>

"But it is altogether too simplistic, if not superficial, to suggest that
commercial transactions stand outside the fiduciary regime
as though in some
way commercial transactions do not lend themselves to the creation of a
relationship in which one person comes
under an obligation to act in the
interests of another.  The fact that in the great majority of commercial
transactions the parties
stand at arm's length does not enable us to make a
generalisation that is universally true in relation to every commercial
transaction.
 <u>In truth, every transaction must be examined on its merits
with a view to ascertaining whether it manifests the characteristics of
a
fiduciary relationship</u>."  (My emphasis.)
<P>

385   	At p.101, his Honour concluded that as USSC entrusted HPI
with a responsibility for protecting and promoting the marketing
of USSC's
products in Australia, it effectively constituted HPI the custodian of its
product goodwill in Australia and, in exercising
that responsibility, HPI "had
a special opportunity of acting to the detriment of USSC which was,
accordingly, vulnerable to the
abuse by HPI of its position".  Whilst his
Honour accepted that each could act in its own interests, he held that HPI was
necessarily
subject to the requirement of acting bona fide and reasonably with
due regard to the interests of USSC and, in those circumstances,
could not act
solely in its own interests without reference to those of USSC, such that HPI
was fixed with the character of a fiduciary
in relation to the specified
activities notwithstanding that it was also acting in its own interests in
pursuing them and was carrying
on the distributorship business generally for
its benefit and in no sense was a trustee for USSC.
<P>

386   	At p.103 his Honour said:-
<P>

"McLelland J found - a finding with which I agree - that, as a fiduciary having
responsibility for protecting and promoting the
market for USSC's products in
Australia, HPI was under a duty not to make a profit or to take a benefit by
virtue of its position
as a fiduciary without the informed consent of USSC and
that within the ambit of its fiduciary responsibility it should not act in
a
way in which there was a possibility of conflict between its own interests and
those of USSC: <i>Queensland Mines Limited v Hudson</i>."
<P>

387   	He continued:-
<P>

"Accordingly, the fiduciary's duty may be more accurately expressed by saying
that he is under an obligation not to promote his
personal interest by making
or pursuing a gain in circumstances in which there is a conflict or a real or
substantial possibility
of a conflict between his personal interests and those
of the persons whom he is bound to protect: <i>Aberdeen Railway Co v Blaikie
Bros</i>.  By linking the obligation not to make a profit or take a benefit to
a situation of conflict or possible conflict of interest the
position, in
accordance with the authorities, (a) excludes the relevance of an inquiry into
the actual motives of the fiduciary;
and (b) excludes restitutionary relief
when the interest of the fiduciary is remote or insubstantial: <i>Boulting v
Association of Cinematrograph, Television and Allied Technicians</i>; <i>Phelan
v Middle States Oil Corporation</i>."
<P>

His Honour considered, therefore, that there was an obligation on the fiduciary
to protect, that obligation being part of the basis
for finding the existence
of such a duty.
<P>

388   	In considering the breaches, his Honour said, at
p.106:-
<P>

"The two breaches described by his Honour need to be understood as involving
actions taken by HPI during the term of the distributorship
with a view to
appropriating USSC's market for itself during that term and thereafter.  Once
the breaches are understood in this
light, it is incontestable, as it seems to
me, that his Honour was correct in finding that the relevant acts constituted
breaches
of fiduciary duty.  HPI, though custodian of USSC's product goodwill,
sought to appropriate that goodwill for itself by the means
described in the
declaration."
<P>

389   	Wilson J was of the view that it was inappropriate, in
the circumstances of the case, to import a fiduciary duty.
<P>

390   	Deane J, at p.122, said that the relationship between a
manufacturer and distributor is not, in itself, ordinarily one of
a fiduciary
nature where the distributor enjoys sole rights of distribution in a particular
area, but rather it is ordinarily a relationship
of seller and buyer.  He did
not consider that the clause requiring the distributor to use its "best
efforts" to build up the market
in Australia "to the common benefit" imposed a
general fiduciary duty, and that there were no circumstances transforming the
relationship
into a partnership or joint venture.  However, he said that the
conclusion that the overall relationship was not of a fiduciary nature
did not
preclude the possibility that, either within or arising from it, a more
restricted fiduciary relationship might exist.  His
Honour considered that
relief did not flow from a breach of a fiduciary duty flowing from an
identified fiduciary relationship, but
he held that USSC was entitled to a
declaration that HPI was liable to account as a constructive trustee for the
profits of the Australian
business in accordance with the principles under
which a constructive trust may be imposed as the appropriate form of equitable
relief
in circumstances where a person could not in good conscience retain for
himself a benefit, or the proceeds of a benefit, which he
appropriated to
himself in breach of contractual or other legal or equitable obligations to
another: p.125.
<P>

391   	Dawson J was of the view that in the circumstances of the
case no fiduciary duty arose.
<P>

392   	In United Dominions Corporation Limited v Brian Pty
Limited &amp; Ors <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20157%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 157 CLR 1</a> the High Court had to consider the position
of parties to a joint venture.  At pp.7 and 8 Gibbs CJ referred to the
difficulty in
defining the circumstances in which a fiduciary relationship will
be found to exist and referred to the decision in Hospital Products.
 He
considered that there was, in the circumstances of UDC, "a relationship between
UDC and Brian based on the same mutual trust
and confidence, and requiring the
same good faith and fairness, as if a formal partnership deed had been
executed".
<P>

393   	In their joint judgment, at p.10, Mason, Brennan and
Deane JJ said:-
<P>

"The term `joint venture' is not a technical one with a settled common law
meaning.  As a matter of ordinary language, it connotes
an association of
persons for the purposes of a particular trading, commercial, mining or other
financial undertaking or endeavour
with a view to mutual profit, with each
participant usually (but not necessarily) contributing money, property or
skill."
<P>

Their Honours noted that a joint venture would often be a partnership.
<P>

394   	They continued, pp.10 and 11:--
<P>

"The most that can be said is that whether or not the relationship between
joint venturers is fiduciary will depend upon the form
which the particular
joint venture takes and upon the content of the obligations which the parties
to it have undertaken.  If the
joint venture takes the form of a partnership,
the fact that it is confined to one joint undertaking as distinct from being a
continuing
relationship will not prevent the relationship between the joint
venturers from being a fiduciary one.  In such a case, the joint
venturers will
be under fiduciary duties to one another, including fiduciary duties in
relation to property the subject of the joint
venture, which are the ordinary
incidents of the partnership relationship, though those fiduciary duties will
be moulded to the character
of the particular relationship: see, generally,
<i>Birtchnell v Equity Trustees, Executors and Agency Co Limited</i>."
<P>

395   	Their Honours considered that the relationship was a
fiduciary one as the participants were joint venturers in a commercial
enterprise with a view to profit, which was to be shared.
<P>

396   	They rejected, pp.11 and 12, the general legal
proposition that the relationship between prospective partners or joint
venturers
could not be a fiduciary one until a formal agreement was executed,
and continued:-
<P>

"A fiduciary relationship can arise and fiduciary duties can exist between
parties who have not reached and who may never reach,
agreement upon the
consensual terms which are to govern the arrangement between them.  <u>In
particular, a fiduciary relationship with attendant fiduciary obligations may,
and ordinarily will, exist between prospective partners
who have embarked upon
the conduct of the partnership business or venture before the precise terms of
any partnership agreement have
been settled.  Indeed, in such circumstances,
the mutual confidence and trust which underlie most consensual fiduciary
relationships
are likely to be more readily apparent than in the case where
mutual rights and obligations have been expressly defined in some formal
agreement</u>.  Likewise, the relationship between prospective partners or
participants in a proposed partnership to carry out a single joint undertaking
or endeavour will ordinarily be fiduciary if the prospective partners have
reached an informal arrangement to assume such a relationship
and have
proceeded to take steps involved in its establishment or implementation."  (My
emphasis.)
<P>

It may be that this decision indicated a shift, in respect of the relevant
relationship, from an obligation to act in the interests
of another, to an
obligation arising from mutual confidence and trust, or it may be that that
obligation is merely an example of
an obligation to act, at least partly, in
the interests of another, i.e. in the interests of each other.
<P>

397   	Their Honours considered that by the relevant time
arrangements between the prospective joint venturers had passed far beyond
the
stage of mere negotiation, each having agreed by then to be and having been
accepted as a participant in each of the joint ventures
if both or either of
them went ahead, and each having made or agreed to make financial contributions
towards the costs of the project
or projects in which it or he had agreed to
participate.  In my opinion, the facts of the instant case justify the
conclusion that
the parties had passed beyond "mere" negotiation, to a stage of
the type their Honours identified.
<P>

398   	At p.13 their Honours said:-
<P>

"It matters not, for present purposes, whether that relationship is seen as
that which may exist between prospective partners or
joint venturers before the
terms of any partnership or joint venture agreement have been settled or
<u>whether it is seen as a limited preliminary partnership or joint venture to
investigate and explore the possibilities of an ultimate
joint venture or
ventures.  On either approach, it was a fiduciary one</u>.
<P>

That being so, the proposed participants in each joint venture were under
fiduciary obligations to one another in relation to the
proposed project at the
time when the first of the mortgages was given and accepted.  <u>In particular,
each participant was under a fiduciary duty to refrain from pursuing, obtaining
or retaining for itself or himself
any collateral advantage in relation to the
proposed project without the knowledge and informed assent of the other
participants</u>.  `The subject-matter over which the fiduciary obligations'
extended must be `determined by the character of the venture or undertaking
for
which' the relationship between the prospective joint venturers existed: per
Dixon J, <i>Birtchnell</i> in a partnership context but equally applicable
here."  (My emphasis.)
<P>

Dawson J agreed in the reasons of Mason, Brennan and Deane JJ.
<P>

In my respectful opinion, the passage I have just cited (and indeed the whole
judgment in United Dominions) gives rise to the fiduciary
duty or obligation of
the type for which HJPL contends.
<P>

399   	In Biala Pty Limited v Mallina Holdings Limited &amp; Ors
(1993) ACSC 11.785, Mallina Holdings Limited and the sixth defendant,
Dempster
Nominees Pty Limited, jointly began to pursue an "exclusive mandate" from the
Western Australian State Government to carry
out a feasibility study for the
development of a petro-chemical complex in Western Australia.  The second
defendant, Mr Dempster,
was chairman and managing director of both companies
and took charge of taking the project forward.  There was no written or oral
agreement between Mallina Holdings and Dempster Nominees concerning the joint
venture, and no resolution of directors of Mallina
relating to the formation of
one.  Thereafter, there was a series of somewhat complicated manoeuvres in
which it was agreed that
Mallina Holdings would give up its interest in the
joint venture and pass on all relevant information to a new joint venture
between
Mr Dempster and Mr Connell.  The plaintiffs, who were minority
shareholders in Mallina Holdings, brought derivative claims seeking
an account
of profits or alternatively equitable compensation against Dempster Nominees,
Dempster and other parties alleging breaches
of fiduciary duty owed to Mallina
Holdings under the joint venture.
<P>

400   	At p.831, Ipp J said that Mallina Holdings and Dempster
Nominees "associated together for the purpose of undertaking a single,
but
continuing venture out of which they hoped to make profits which they agreed to
share equally".  His Honour considered it was
not necessary to decide whether
they were partners or joint venturers because, whatever the characterisation of
their relationship,
it was plainly based upon mutual confidence and trust.
This characterisation was consistent with United Dominions, and, accordingly,
his Honour considered, in those circumstances, that the obligations specified
in the majority decision in United Dominions were applicable.
 These included
the obligations of the utmost good faith.
<P>

401   	Mr Bathurst also relied upon the decision in Marr v
Arabco Traders Limited [1987] 1 NZBLC 102,732 at 102,745, which was quoted
by
Hammond J in Dickie v Torbay Pharmacy (1986) Limited  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%203%20NZLR%20429" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 3 NZLR 429</a> at
pp.439-440, where his Honour said:-
<P>

"<u>If the course of dealing indicates an intention to carry out a common
purpose by joint association in a way that involves mutual confidence
in each
other, fiduciary duties may well result</u>.  This of course is clearly the
case where there is a partnership and where there is a joint venture other than
a partnership.  It
can also be the case where the parties are negotiating to
achieve either of those relationships or where they have formed an association
of the kind I have described, which although it may not amount to a partnership
or a joint venture, is akin to one or the other."
 (My emphasis.)
<P>

402   	In Brunninghausen v Glavanics  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/199.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWCA 199</a> the Court
of Appeal considered the existence of a fiduciary duty in the context of
whether a duty was owed by a controlling director/shareholder
to the only other
shareholder.  The director, who had the effective control of a company, was
negotiating to buy the shares of that
shareholder.  In the course of those
negotiations, he failed to disclose that he was negotiating for the sale of the
company's assets
at a price which would increase the shares' value
substantially above that at which he was negotiating to buy them from the other
shareholder.  Bryson J held that a fiduciary duty was owed by the appellant, as
a director, to the respondent as a shareholder, and
that the failure to
disclose the existence of the other negotiations was a breach of that duty.
These findings were upheld on appeal.
<P>

403   	The principal judgment was delivered by Handley JA, who
quoted his Honour's finding that there was "no relationship of confidence,
and
indeed all trust had been broken years before and succeeded by hostility at the
worst, wariness at the best".  His Honour also
noted that the established rule
was that "in general a director's fiduciary duties are owed only to the
company", and then considered
the reasons why Bryson J had thought that not to
be applicable in the present case and, at para 49, Handley JA said:-
<P>

"Some of the Judge's conclusions come close to a finding of unconscionable
dealing or equitable fraud in the nature of a catching
bargain with the
plaintiff, but no such case was pleaded or litigated, and is irrelevant when
considering whether there is a fiduciary
duty."
<P>

404   	In para 54, Handley JA noted the facts on which the
existence of a fiduciary duty had to exist in that case, which were devoid
of
any relationship of "actual trust and confidence".  His Honour said that for
the duty to exist "it must arise from the bare facts
of the relationship",
which included "the exclusive advantage or opportunity which the defendant's
position conferred on him to receive
any offers to purchase the company's
business from third parties".  He said that the duty must be imposed "by law"
as the defendant
"did nothing which could be construed as the voluntary
assumption of such a duty.  Further, Bryson J held that there was not a
comprehensive
fiduciary duty, but one limited to the disclosure of the
unexpected offer by a third party to purchase the entire business".
<P>

405   	Handley JA considered in detail circumstances in which
directors come under fiduciary duties, including those where commercial
opportunities come to their notice by virtue of their office.  He then turned
to consider cases where, in a commercial context, there
was an allegation that
a fiduciary duty had arisen.  At para 99, he held that the defendant, as the
sole effective director, occupied
a position of advantage in relation to the
plaintiff, the advantage being that the plaintiff was virtually powerless to
affect the
course of the company's affairs or to ascertain the existence of the
negotiations.  In these circumstances he was, to use the words
of Mason J in
Hospital Products, "at the mercy of" and "vulnerable to abuse" by the defendant
"of his position".  In all these circumstances
his Honour found that there was
a fiduciary duty, a judgment in which Priestley and Stein JJA agreed.
<P>

406   	There is some analogy between that case and the present,
although, on one view, Brunninghausen may well stretch the range
of fiduciary
duty further than previously.  This could well arise because that was not a
case in which there was any element of "acting
for" or trust. The present is, I
think, a stronger case  because the nature of the relationship, and the
elements of the relationship,
quite clearly gave rise to a fiduciary duty, in
accordance, for example, with United Dominions, and because BKC deliberately
refrained
from advising HJPL of the true position so far as Shell was concerned
in circumstances where it was under an obligation to do so,
and because BKC
exploited Shell's reservations about HJPL to its own perceived commercial
advantage in circumstances in which HJPL
was vulnerable to abuse by BKC of its
position, and was left in a position of vulnerability by virtue of BKC's
failure to make disclosure.
  In my opinion, it is also significant that in the
instant case the parties were entitled to proceed on the basis of mutual trust
and confidence brought about by the relationship constituted by the continuing
negotiations in which they were engaging and the basis
on which they were
proceeding.  HJPL was, in my view, entitled to expect that BKC would have
regard to its interests, and certainly
would not actively do anything to damage
them.  It was also entitled to expect that if BKC proposed to change its
position BKC would
advise it.
<P>

407   	In my opinion, BKC, in all the circumstances, owed HJPL a
fiduciary duty, which it breached in the ways for which Mr Bathurst
submitted.
Mr Oslington submitted that the proper inference to be drawn from the evidence
was that irrespective of the conduct of
BKC, Shell had decided that it would
not proceed so long as HJPL was associated with the venture, irrespective of
BKC's conduct.
<P>

408   	He submitted that neither was there any evidence that BKC
was the moving party in the breakdown of the relationship, nor
was there any
evidence that BKC did or said anything "to fuel Shell's dissatisfaction with
HJPL".  To the contrary, he submitted,
at the teleconference BKC suggested to
Shell that the tripartite test should continue in parallel with the proposed
bipartite test,
a suggestion Shell accepted.
<P>

409   	I do not accept these submissions.  There was an
abundance of evidence to support the inference that BKC was well aware that
Shell was seeking to deal with it to the exclusion of HJPL, that BKC did
nothing to seek to dissuade Shell from this course, and
that BKC was prepared
to deal separately with Shell through the bipartite agreement and otherwise to
the detriment of HJPL and for
its own benefit.  For some time prior to 15 May
1995, BKC was discussing with Shell how matters could be arranged in the
absence
of HJPL, a matter about which Mr Power's facsimile transmission spoke
eloquently.  The obvious willingness of BKC to fall in with
and assist the
achievement of Shell's stated desires, and its failure to take any steps to
dissuade Shell from that attitude or to
persuade it to deal with HJPL, which
actions were clearly motivated by BKC's concerns for its commercial interests
which it saw to
be at odds with those of HJPL, were sufficient, in the
circumstances of this case, to show the breach of the fiduciary duties, and
to
negate Mr Oslington's submissions.
<P>

410   	Mr Bathurst drew attention to the facts that BKC conceded
that it did nothing to seek to persuade Shell to continue with
HJPL,
notwithstanding that Mr Fitzjohn was of the view that HJPL was suitable to
provide services to it, and that no evidence was
called from Shell to seek to
demonstrate that whatever may have been the attitude of BKC, it would,
none-the-less, only have dealt
with BKC.  Indeed, the evidence of what
transpired thereafter would have made it difficult to imagine that such
evidence would have
been given.
<P>

411   	Mr Oslington submitted that HJPL's failings, as perceived
by BKC, in compliance with its contractual obligations with BKC,
made it hardly
surprising that BKC did not mount "a spirited defence to Shell's
dissatisfaction" of HJPL.  However, there was no
evidence either that Shell was
aware of these problems or the facts giving rise to them, or that those matters
led to Shell's dissatisfaction.
<P>

412   	There were various matters, which would indicate that
Shell was by no means as implacable as Mr Oslington suggested.  Firstly,
Shell
was annoyed at BKC's having written to HJPL on 15 May 1995 without clearing the
terms of the letter with it, such annoyance
indicating that Shell did not want
its attitude conveyed without its concurrence.  This is hardly consistent with
a determination
not to deal with HJPL.  Secondly, Shell was prepared to
countenance the continuance of the tripartite test in parallel with the
bipartite
test.  Thirdly, Shell was prepared to enter into the Tripartite Test
Agreement as late as February or March 1995, which, at least
to the extent of
several sites, meant that it had direct contractual relations with HJPL.
<P>

413   	The vexed question arose as to whether there was a causal
relationship between the breaches by BKC and any loss caused to
HJPL such as to
entitle it to equitable compensation.  Mr Bathurst submitted that in this
context there was no need to establish
causation to the extent required at
common law, it being sufficient to prove that there was a breach of fiduciary
duty and loss.
 In my opinion, that puts the matter too simplistically.  Mr
Oslington submitted that either HJPL had failed to establish, or he
had
established, that the loss would have occurred in any event because Shell would
not have dealt with HJPL, such that even if BKC
was in breach, the breach was
not causative of loss.  In my opinion, those factual cases have not been made
out.
<P>

414   	I do not find it necessary to repeat what I wrote in
Beach Petroleum NL v Abbott Tout Russell Kennedy  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2026%20ACSR%20114" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 26 ACSR 114</a> on this
subject at pp.280 to 288.  I referred to all the authorities of which I was
then aware dealing with causation.  I included
in that survey the decision of
the Court of Appeal in Greater Pacific Investments Pty Limited (In Liquidation)
v Australian National
Industries Limited &amp; Anor  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2039%20NSWLR%20143" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 39 NSWLR 143</a> at
p.154.  I concluded:-
<P>

"In my opinion these authorities lead inevitably to the conclusion that the
correct principle to apply, in assessing loss, is to
have regard to an
assessment of it caused by the breach on a commonsense view of causation:
<i>Greater Pacific Investments</i>, or considering whether there is `an
adequate or sufficient connection between the equitable compensation claimed
and the breach
of fiduciary duty': <i>Maguire</i>."
<P>

415   	Since I wrote that judgment, judgment in an appeal from
which is reserved by the Court of Appeal, that Court has delivered
judgment in
O'Halloran v R.T. Thomas &amp; Family Pty Limited <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/596.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 596</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2045%20NSWLR%20262" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 45 NSWLR 262.</a>
Priestley and Meagher JJA who, with Spigelman CJ, sat on the appeal concurred
in the decision of McLelland AJA in Greater Pacific,
although no reference
appears to have been made to that case in argument, nor was it made in the
judgments.
<P>

416   	The Chief Justice commenced to consider causation at
p.271.  His Honour referred to the speech of Lord Hoffman in Environment
Agency
(formerly National River Authority) v Empress Car Co (Abertillery) Limited
<a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] UKHL 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%202%20WLR%20350" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 2 WLR 350</a>, which was delivered after Beach.  At p.273 his Honour
accepted that the decisions of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Target Holdings Limited
v Redferns <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1995/10.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] UKHL 10</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20AC%20421" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 AC 421</a> and McLachlin J in Canson Enterprises Limited v
Broughton &amp; Co  <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1991/1991scr3-534/1991scr3-534.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 85 DLR (4th) 129</a> represented the law in Australia.
In Target Holdings, his Lordship stressed that the purpose of equitable
compensation was:-
<P>

"To make good a loss in fact suffered by the beneficiaries and which, using
hindsight and commonsense, can be seen to be caused
by the breach."
<P>

417   	McLachlin J said that the loss was to be assessed with
the benefit of hindsight, and that whilst foreseeability was not a
concern in
assessing compensation ".. it is essential that the losses made good are only
those which on a commonsense view of causation,
were caused by the breach".
<P>

418   	At p.276 the Chief Justice referred to the requirement in
Maguire &amp; Anor v Makaronis &amp; Anor <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20188%20CLR%20449" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 188 CLR 449</a> that there must be
"an adequate or sufficient connection between the equitable compensation
claimed and the breach of fiduciary duty".
<P>

419   	Priestley JA was of the view that the test in London Loan
and Savings Co v Brickenden  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281934%29%203%20DLR%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1934) 3 DLR 465</a> should be applied in Australia.
Arguably that is a lower test of causation and, perhaps, is not consistent with
that stated in Maguire.
 Meagher JA agreed with the Chief Justice.
<P>

420   	In the present case applying the principles approved by
the Chief Justice and Meagher JA, which, if I may say so with respect,
are, I
think, consistent with the approach I took in Beach, I have come to the
conclusion that the breaches of fiduciary duty were
causative of the loss
sustained by HJPL, which it seeks to recover.  I shall return to the
quantification of those losses.
<P>

The Further Contractual Issues
<P>

421   	In addition to the case based on the alleged invalidity
of the termination of the Development Agreement, HJPL relied on other
alleged
breaches of it.  In paragraph 31.2 of its written submissions in chief HJPL
alleged that BKC was in breach of implied terms
of the Development Agreement,
in that it:-
<P>

(a)	placed a freeze on the recruitment of third party franchisees from May
1995, the effect of which was to deny HJPL the right
to "introduce" third party
franchisees in accordance with clause 7.1 of the Development Agreement;
<P>

(b)	withheld financial approval from September 1995;
<P>

(c)	denied operational approval from November 1995; and
<P>

(d)	directed HJPL not to submit any further franchise applications in June
1996.
<P>

422   	Mr Bathurst submitted that the consequences of these
breaches were:-
<P>

(a)	That HJPL was wrongfully denied the opportunity to continue to expand by
means of company owned stores from September 1995,
for which it claimed
damages.
<P>

(b)	That HJPL was wrongfully denied financial benefits that would have accrued
from the recruitment of third party franchisees,
for which it claimed
damages.
<P>

(c)	That BKC's termination of the Development Agreement, in purported reliance
upon clause 15, was itself a breach of contract by
BKC.
<P>

(d)	Alternatively that BKC was not entitled to terminate the Development
Agreement in reliance upon the Shorter Notice because HJPL's
failure to build
the remaining three restaurants in 1995/1996 was a consequence of BKC's breach
of contract.  The submission in this
regard continued that where BKC had caused
HJPL's failure to perform an obligation or to satisfy a condition giving rise
to an obligation,
BKC could not take advantage of that failure to terminate.
<P>

423   	In relation to implied terms, Mr Bathurst submitted that
under the Development Agreement HJPL had a qualified right to develop
Burger
King restaurants in Australia, the right being qualified by the requirement
that it secure "Franchise Approval" in accordance
with clause 4.1, which
entailed its following the procedures for franchise and site approval "through
BKC standard franchise and
site approval procedures", and the granting by BKC
of approval being subject to "a condition" that HJPL must have "in the sole
discretion
of BKC", operational, financial and legal approval "at the time of
application for a franchise".  
<P>

424   	Reference was then made to clauses 7.1, .2 and .3, which
I have quoted.
<P>

425   	Mr Bathurst's submission was that BKC was contractually
obliged to approve third parties as franchisees, which were introduced
by HJPL
provided that such franchisees met BKC's approval procedures and there was no
substantial adverse affectation of the type
contemplated.  Therefore, he
submitted, there was no right in BKC to impose a blanket freeze on third party
franchisees.  Before
coming to this, it is desirable to consider some other
submissions.
<P>

426   	The submission continued that the implied terms were set
forth in paragraph 48 of the Summons.  They were "condensed" into
three.
Firstly, that there was an implied term that BKC would do all that was
reasonably necessary to enable HJPL to enjoy the benefits
of, inter alia, the
Development Agreement: Mackay v Dick  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281881%29%206%20AC%20251" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1881) 6 App.Cas. 251</a> at p.263; Butt v
McDonald (1896) 7 QLJ 68 AT PP.70-71; Secured Income Real Estate (Australia)
Limited v St Martins Investments Pty
Limited <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1979/51.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1979] HCA 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%20144%20CLR%20596" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 144 CLR 596</a> at p.607; and
News Corporation Limited v Australian Rugby League <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1996/870.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] FCA 870</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20139%20ALR%20193" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 139 ALR 193.</a>  I do
not think there can be any doubt that there was such an implied term.  It was
submitted that the benefit to HJPL of the Development
Agreement was the right
to develop company owned restaurants and to have third parties introduced by it
establish restaurants and,
to achieve that, it was "necessary" for BKC to grant
franchise approval under clause 4.1; to consider each application lodged by
each proposed third party franchisee introduced by HJPL on its merits; and not
to terminate the Development Agreement which conferred
those rights on HJPL.
<P>

427   	I do not accept, in the unequivocal terms in which it
appears, the third assertion.
<P>

428   	The submission continued that in respect of this implied
term the issue is whether, as a matter of fact and/or discretion,
BKC was
justified under the terms of the Development Agreement in deciding not to grant
franchise approval to HJPL under clause 4.1;
in deciding not to accept
applications from third party franchisees introduced by it; and in deciding, I
interpolate "in the circumstances",
to terminate the Development Agreement.
<P>

429   	The second term said to be implied was that BKC must act
reasonably in exercising its powers under the Development Agreement:
Renard
Constructions (ME) Pty Limited v Minister for Public Works  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2026%20NSWLR%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 26 NSWLR
234.</a>
<P>

430   	In Renard the general conditions of a building contract
provided for a procedure to be followed on default by a contractor.
 It was
that if the contractor defaulted in the performance or observance of any
obligation in the contract, the principal may suspend
payment and call upon the
contractor to show cause within a specified period why the powers contained in
that clause should not be
exercised, such powers being the right to take over
the whole or any part of the work or to cancel the contract.  Thus, any breach
would give rise to that right however minimal or inconsequential or capable of
remedy or cure it may be.
<P>

431   	At p.258 Priestley JA pointed out the problems he
perceived with the clause, namely the ability of the principal to give
a notice
to show cause upon any default, however trivial, with which notice the
contractor may not be able to comply within the time
specified.  His Honour was
of the view that if the principal, in those circumstances, was able to exclude
the contractor from the
site and/or cancel the contract, it would make the
contract "as a matter of business quite unworkable".  He continued:-
<P>

"One way of explaining this view is to say that no contractor in his senses
would enter into a contract under which such a thing
could happen.  The
reasonable contractor, the reasonable principal and the reasonable looker-on
will all assume that such a result
could not come about except with good
reason.
<P>

The over-riding purpose of the contract from both the contractor's and the
principal's point of view is to have the contract work
completed by the
contractor in accordance with the contract, in return for payment by the
principal in accordance with the contract.
 The insertion of a sub-clause such
as sub-clause 44.1 not subject to the constraint of reasonable use by the
principal is quite
inconsistent with all the main contractual promises by each
party to the contract to the other.  The contract can, in my opinion
only be
effective as a workable business document under which the promises of each
party to the other may be fulfilled, if the sub-clause
is read in a way I have
indicated, that is, as subject to requirements of reasonableness."
<P>

If I may say so with respect, I am not certain of the justification for the
assumption.  The parties had entered into a written
contract, which denied it.
However, the decision is binding on me.
<P>

432   	His Honour was of the view that that reading did not
detract from the usefulness of the sub-clause to the principal because
if there
was "some significant default by the contractor then the principal can give
notice to show cause".  He was of the view that
in each case the question to be
answered was whether the principal, in exercising the power, was acting
reasonably and that:-
<P>

"On the approach I favour, it will only be if the non-satisfaction of the
principal does not have a reasonable basis or the decision
to exercise a power
or powers has no reasonable basis that the exercise of one or more of the
powers will be in breach of one or
both the implied obligations.  It seems to
me that if in such a case (that is, where there is no reasonable basis at
either stage)
the principal was contractually entitled to exercise one or more
of the powers, and did so, the very exercise itself would deprive
the contract
of its business efficacy": p.259.
<P>

The precise juridical basis for finding that such a term exists must be that it
is an implied term.  The terms of a contract are
either express or implied, the
circumstances in which a term will be implied being well understood.  However,
if I may say so with
respect, it is difficult to see how, consistently with
those principles, one can imply a general term of "reasonableness".  Meaning
and content can only be given to that word by a judicial assessment, which may
not match that of the contracting parties as to what
is "reasonable", and which
certainly may not be capable of clear expression.  One only has to pose the
question "At what point does
action become unreasonable?", in the context of
the administration of a complicated building contract, to highlight the
potential
problems and the wide range of possible answers.
<P>

433   	Handley JA was of the view that there was an implication
of reasonableness, and said, at p.279:-
<P>

"The power arises on the happening of any breach, however minor, and whenever
the breach occurs.  It also arises upon the contractor
neglecting to comply
with any direction given by the principal, however minor, accidental or
temporary that neglect might be, and
regardless of the importance or otherwise
of the subject matter.  This express power therefore covers many cases where
the principal
would have no power to rescind the contract for breach under the
general law.
<P>

Apart from the great width of those powers, there are three other matters which
support the existence of some restraint on their
exercise apart from the normal
requirement of honesty."
<P>

Presumably the reason for the clause was to avoid the point to which his Honour
referred in the last sentence of the first paragraph
I have just quoted.  If
the parties had wished to rely on these rights at general law such a clause
would have been unnecessary.
 I am not certain why one does not assume that the
words of the contract, into which they entered freely, indicated that they did
not.
<P>

It is not permissible to imply a term which contradicts the words of the
contract.  The importation of an implied term of reasonableness
is seen by some
as an affront to the parties' freedom to contract in such terms as they choose,
and as a derogation of rights and
obligations on the basis of which they have
contracted.
<P>

434   	His Honour examined certain matters in relation to the
power and said that there was provided some indication that the contractor
was
entitled to appeal to objective considerations, including questions of
reasonableness in showing cause against the exercise of
the powers.  He
continued:-
<P>

"The very notion of showing cause seems inconsistent with the view that the
principal will be entitled to act, within the limits
of honesty, on his own
idiosyncratic opinion."
<P>

435   	That may have left room for it to be submitted, in the
present case, that as BKC was able to act "in its sole discretion"
it could not
give effect to its own "idosyncratic opinion".  However, at p.280, his Honour
continued:-
<P>

"The second matter depends on whether `the satisfaction of the principal' in
clause 44.1 refers to an opinion which is reasonable
or to one which is merely
honest.  The implication of reasonableness is readily made: see <i>Willis &amp;
Co Limited v Arcos Limited</i> .. where Lord Wright referred to: `.. the legal
implication in contracts of what is reasonable, which runs throughout the whole
of
modern English law in relation to business contracts'."
<P>

Subsequently his Honour said:-
<P>

"It seems to me that clause 44.1 should be construed as requiring the principal
to act reasonably as well as honestly in forming
the opinion that the
contractor has failed to show cause to his satisfaction and thereafter in
deciding whether or not to take over
the whole or any part of the remaining
work or to cancel the contract: see generally <i>Amann </i>.."
<P>

This passage, together with some others to which I have referred, suggests that
the question may be determined by construction of
the existing terms, rather
than implication of further ones.
<P>

436   	Meagher JA dissented.  His Honour noted that Cole J had
rejected any submission that reasonableness could be imported as
a limitation
on the exercise of the powers and considered that his Honour was right to do
so.  His Honour was of the view that such
a limitation, if it existed, could
only arise either from the express words of the contract or by way of an
implied term, and that,
in that case, it arose from neither.
<P>

437   	The matter was re-visited in Hughes Bros Pty Limited v
The Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Archdiocese of Sydney
&amp;
Anor  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2031%20NSWLR%2091" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 31 NSWLR 91.</a>  Once again clause 44.1 was in issue.  Kirby P said,
at p.92, that Priestley JA had demonstrated that the key question in the appeal
was determined by the decision in Renard.  His Honour was obviously of the view
that the decision reached by Priestley and Handley
JJA was one "concerning the
true construction of" the clause: p.93.  He considered that he was bound by
that decision.
<P>

438   	Priestley JA dealt with the conflicting views of Meagher
JA and himself and, at p.100, said that an essential part of the
reasoning of
the majority was that the principal was required to act reasonably in deciding
whether or not to exercise a power under
the clause.  His Honour was obviously
of the view that the term as to reasonableness was an implied term: p.102.  I
have the same
difficulties about the implication of such a term.
<P>

439   	Meagher JA felt that he was able to distinguish the two
cases.
<P>

440   	In Alcatel Australia Limited v Scarcella &amp; Ors <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/483.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 483</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998)
44 NSWLR 349</a> Sheller JA delivered the judgment of the Court in which Powell and
Beazley JJA agreed.  His Honour dealt with the matter on the basis
of an
implied term and, after analysing Renard, he considered the decision in Hughes
Aircraft Systems International v Air Services
Australia <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1997/558.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] FCA 558</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20146%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 146 ALR 1</a> and a
number of other authorities.  He concluded, at p.369:-
<P>

"The decisions in <i>Renard Constructions</i> and <i>Hughes Bros</i> mean that
in New South Wales <u>a duty of good faith</u>, both in performing obligations
and exercising rights, may by implication be imposed upon parties as part of a
contract.  There is
no reason why such a duty should not be implied as part of
this lease.  But it remains to decide whether the implication of that
duty has
any consequence in the resolution of the dispute the subject of this appeal."
(My emphasis.)
<P>

His Honour appears to be equating "reasonableness" and "good faith", probably
by reason of the analogy Priestley JA drew between
the two concepts in Renard
at pp.263-264.  The various authorities and academic writings are dealt with
extensively by Einstein J
in Aiton Australia Pty Limited v Transfield Pty
Limited  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/996.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWSC 996.</a>  I find it unnecessary to examine the matter further
as I am bound by the Court of Appeal decisions to hold that there is an implied
term of either reasonableness or a duty of good faith or, perhaps, both.
<P>

441   	The submission was that the reasonableness and good faith
terms should be implied for the purpose of ensuring that BKC exercised
its
powers in a proper manner for the protection of its own rights and not, for
example, to bring pressure to bear on HJPL to resolve
other disputes between
BKC and it, or to deprive HJPL of rights under the Development Agreement for
ulterior or collateral purposes.
Thus, so the submission ran, BKC could not, by
the exercise of its sole discretion, deprive HJPL of, for example, operational
approval
for the purpose, ulterior to the contract, of preventing it exercising
its right to develop unless there was factual justification
provided by the
terms of the Development Agreement for taking that course.  It seems to me
that, in the absence of such factual justification
there would be no basis to
exercise the "sole", even if also "unfettered" discretion, adversely to HJPL as
a matter of construction,
irrespective of the need to imply terms.  
<P>

442   	The factual bases allowing for the exercise of that
discretion are specified in the Development Agreement.  The matter does
become
of significance when it is alleged that very minor breaches, falling within the
contractual proscription, will enable the
sole discretion to be exercised.  In
those circumstances one must decide whether the proper approach is to construe
the contract
so as not to allow minor breaches, which do not affect its
operation, to be the trigger for the exercise of the sole discretion;
or to
proceed or the basis that there is an implied term of reasonableness or a duty
of good faith precluding reliance on those breaches.
 It is only by following
one or other of these paths that I can explain, in a manner consistent with the
law relating to contracts
as I understand it, the conclusion which is
appropriate.
<P>

443   	The submission then pointed to BKC's having certain
policies or established practices for the determination of financial
and
operational approval, and that whilst these did not have contractual force,
each was relevant to determine whether BKC had acted
reasonably and in good
faith, i.e. for a proper purpose as provided by the Development Agreement.
<P>

444   	The submission then moved to the freeze on third party
franchisees, which was applied from about 17 May 1995 when Mr Power
instructed
Mr McCarthy to discontinue dissemination of information to prospective third
party franchisees until further notice, which
effectively prevented further
third party recruiting.  Thereafter, there was correspondence and discussion
about that matter and,
by 15 April 1996, Mr Miolla had confirmed that BKC had
not changed its position in relation to third party franchisee recruiting,
and
he provided no indication that BKC would be reviewing its decision.
<P>

445   	HJPL was under no contractual obligation to prepare any
particular form of information to be issued to prospective third
party
franchisees, but it agreed to BKC's suggestion that an Australian Franchise
Information Package be prepared for dissemination
to such people.  Thereafter
BKC delayed in the finalisation of that Package, the stated justification being
its requirement, contrary
to its practice in the United States, that a pro
forma profit and loss statement be included, and that HJPL's financial
performance
in 1995 indicated that the Hungry Jack's restaurant system was weak
and that no third party franchisees should be permitted to open
restaurants
until its profit and loss accounts showed that the average restaurant in the
system was profitable.  It was submitted
that this allegation of financial
weakness was greatly exaggerated and that, apart from restaurants in Victoria,
there was no indication
of any lack of profitability of restaurants in other
parts of Australia, BKC's concerns about lack of profitability apparently being
derived substantially from inaccurate information passed on by Mr Montgomery to
Messrs Power and Miolla.  Mr Bathurst submitted that
for the purpose of the
reasonableness term, neither of BKC's purported justifications for the freeze
could be justified as satisfying
the test of reasonableness and, in relation to
the good faith term, the purpose of the freeze was motivated by reasons other
than
those which would otherwise justify it.
<P>

446   	In his oral submissions, Mr Bathurst contended that upon
a proper construction of clause 7.1, if HJPL exercised its right
to introduce
third party franchisees to BKC, there was an obligation on BKC to approve them,
arising from the words "shall approve",
subject to the same approval procedures
as applied to HJPL, including operational, financial and legal approval.  He
submitted that
there was no evidence that any potential third party franchisee
did not have those approvals or, perhaps more correctly, were not
entitled to
those approvals, and that the reason the applications were never considered, as
BKC was obliged to do, was because BKC
had taken the stance that it was not
prepared to do so.  This, so it was submitted, amounted to a breach of clause
7.1 and a breach
of the implied term to co-operate. 
<P>

447   	In my opinion, the question of the entitlement of BKC to
impose a freeze on the recruitment of third party franchisees can
be dealt with
quite quickly on a construction of clause 7.1 of the Development Agreement.
HJPL had a right to introduce proposed
third party franchisees.  BKC was
obliged, ("shall"), to approve such franchisees "subject to the same approval
procedures as apply
to" HJPL "including operational, financial and legal
approvals".  Therefore, provided those requirements were met and there was no
"locational" conflict or problem, BKC had no right not to accept third party
franchisees.  It purported to reject them on the other
grounds to which I have
referred, but which did not comprise grounds for which the agreement made
provision.  That, in my view, is
sufficient to dispose of this issue favourably
to HJPL, but I think that I should deal with other submissions.
<P>

448   	The written submissions on the freeze on the recruitment
of third party franchisees are dealt with commencing at paragraph
23.30.  It
was submitted that the two primary reasons were the need to prepare a
satisfactory pro forma profit and loss statement
for inclusion in the
Information Package, and HJPL's financial performance in 1995, which indicated
a financial weakness in the operation
of "Hungry Jack's" restaurants in
Australia, such that it would be imprudent of BKC to permit any new franchisee
to open a restaurant
in those circumstances.  Mr Bathurst submitted that
neither of those objections would withstand scrutiny.  The factual matters on
which Mr Bathurst relied in relation to the first objection are set forth in
paragraphs 23.31 and .32, it being put, generally speaking,
that there was no
attempt by BKC to respond to suggestions for an amended pro forma profit and
loss account, and that BKC continually
deferred a review of the Franchisee
Information Package, which had still not taken place at the time of BKC's
purported termination
of the Development Agreement.  BKC's gross delay,
together with the failure to have any such requirement for proposed franchisees
in the United States, indicates to me either that BKC did not consider the
matter of any importance or, if it did, deliberately refrained
from taking the
necessary action to allow HJPL to continue recruitment.  In either event BKC's
action was unjustified and either
breached the term of reasonable co-operation,
or reasonableness, or good faith. 
<P>

449   	The second basic submission was that concerns about the
profitability of the Hungry Jack's restaurants in Australia were
greatly
exaggerated.  These matters are dealt with in paragraph 23.33.   In this regard
HJPL had received financial approval towards
the end of 1994.  It was not until
later in 1995 that doubt was cast on its general financial viability, a doubt
which, in my opinion
and for reasons to which I shall refer, I do not consider
was justified.
<P>

450   	In March 1996 BKC also asserted a third purported
justification, namely the differences between BKC and HJPL as to the operation
of the Development and Service Agreements leading Mr Miolla, on 13 March 1996,
to advise Mr McCarthy that the very serious issues
between them over the
meaning of those agreements threatened to create liability for BKC and HJPL if
new franchisees were recruited
without disclosing the issue in full, and that
that was a course BKC was unwilling to pursue.  However, on 19 March 1996, Mr
Cowin
responded that issues between BKC and HJPL could not give rise to
liability to third party franchisees if full disclosure of such
matters was
made to potential franchisees and, in April 1996, such disclosure was made to
persons who had already lodged franchise
applications in a form required by
BKC.
<P>

451   	Mr Oslington, in his written submissions, submitted,
firstly, that the freeze did not extend to existing third party franchisees,
although the significance of this is not made clear.  Secondly, he submitted it
did not extend to institutional franchisees, although,
once again, the
significance of this is not made clear.  Thirdly, it was submitted, that Mr
McCarthy acknowledged that whilst there
was a continued lack of performance by
the restaurants in the HJPL system throughout 1995 and 1996, and whilst there
was the need
to prepare a satisfactory pro forma profit and loss account, which
correctly took into account various accounting matters, it would
have been
inappropriate for HJPL and BKC to recruit third party franchisees because they
would have been given misleading information
or, if the truth was disclosed,
the brand could be hurt.  It is correct that Mr McCarthy agreed, Tp.1866, that
if the pro forma profit
and loss accounts in the Information Package were
wrong, that could have a significant misleading effect on the potential third
party
franchisee, and, at Tp.1866, that if there was a disclosure that the
average "system P&amp;L showed an operating loss on trading
for 12 months" that
could hurt the brand.  In the course of answering that question Mr McCarthy
said the alternatives were either
to disclose that fact or not proceed with the
franchise recruitment programme, as Mr Miolla had suggested.  The submission
was then
made that, at Tp.1894, Mr McCarthy agreed that because the brand may
be hurt it was appropriate that there be a freeze on recruitment
activity.  I
do not agree that there was any such concession by Mr McCarthy, nor, elsewhere
in his evidence, did he accept that there
should be a freeze on recruitment.
The closest his evidence went to any such concession appears at Tpp.1891-1892.
Mr Bathurst also
submitted that the evidence was that third party franchisees
were operating profitably, which in my opinion was correct, and that,
in any
event, there had been no financial disapproval of HJPL's expanding.  Mrs
Driscoll was satisfied in early 1996 that HJPL should
be allowed to continue to
expand on the basis that it was financially approved.
<P>

452   	In my opinion, BKC had no contractual right to refuse to
consider the granting of third party franchises if they were submitted
by HJPL.
Its obligation was to consider them and to determine whether, on the standards
specified in clause 7.1, they should be approved.
 The blanket refusal to
consider them was, in my opinion, an obvious breach of clause 7.1.
<P>

453   	I am also of the opinion that the matters raised in
opposition to granting further third party franchisees were contractually
irrelevant matters to which BKC was not entitled to have regard and, in any
event, they were not matters the existence of which BKC
has established at an
evidentiary level.  Further, even if they were established BKC was under a
contractual obligation, arising
from the implied term to co-operate, to assist
HJPL in providing the necessary information, if that was to be done.  Finally,
the
assertion that HJPL's stores were not operating profitably lies uneasily
with the continuance of HJPL's financial approval until
late 1996, particularly
as I am satisfied that the third party franchisees, generally, were trading
profitably.
<P>

454   	Nextly, there was, in my opinion, an obligation on BKC to
act reasonably.  Its failure to act conformably with the Development
Agreement
seems to me to make it unnecessary to consider further whether it acted
reasonably, but, on the assumption that the view
is taken that it was acting
conformably with the contract, at a prima facie level, I am of the view that
the way in which it purported
to exercise its rights was unreasonable.
<P>

455   	Finally, I do not consider that Mr McCarthy consented to
the freeze.  The evidence satisfies me that he was confronted by
BKC with
obstacles, but that he never agreed that the obstacles were such as to justify
no further development.  
<P>

456   	The alleged breach by BKC of its obligations under clause
7.1 to grant development approval led to a submission that where
a party to a
contract makes it impossible for the other party to perform its obligations or
is such that the other party is not required
to continue to offer to perform,
for the purpose of considering whether there has been a breach of contract the
Court regards the
obligations as performed, as a matter of fact.  Reliance was
placed, firstly, upon the decision of the High Court in Peter Turnbull
&amp;
Company Pty Limited v Mundus Trading Company (Australasia) Pty Limited <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1954/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1954] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281954%29%2090%20CLR%20235" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1954)
90 CLR 235.</a>  The facts were that the parties entered into an agreement for the
sale and purchase of a quantity of oats to be loaded on a ship
or ships
nominated by the plaintiff during January or February 1951, the plaintiff being
required to give fourteen days' notice of
ships and shipping dates.  On 8
January 1951 the plaintiff mentioned 14 February 1951 as the approximate
shipping date and later
mentioned a ship, but at no time did it give the
defendant an appropriate shipping notice as required by the agreement.  On 15
January
1951 the plaintiff entered into a contract with a third party to sell
it the same oats fob Sydney intending to deliver against the
contract the oats
it had contracted to buy from the defendant.  At the end of January the
defendant told the plaintiff that it could
not supply the oats fob Sydney, but
claimed that it would be able to deliver them fob Melbourne if the plaintiff
could persuade the
ship to accept them at that port.  The plaintiff's efforts
were unsuccessful and it informed the defendant by letter that the oats
would
have to be loaded in Sydney.  The defendant replied that it had no oats and
could not carry out its contract.  Early in March
the plaintiff bought oats
against its contract with the third party at a higher price, after first
informing the defendant of its
intention to do so and giving it the opportunity
of buying them.  The plaintiff sued the defendant for breach of contract and
recovered
a verdict being the difference between the amount at which it had
agreed to buy from the defendant and the amount it was obliged
to pay to fulfil
its re-sale contract.  It was held that the plaintiff was entitled to succeed
on the ground that in so far as there
was non-fulfilment of the condition
requiring the nomination of a February ship and the giving of fourteen days'
notice of the ship
and shipping date, the defendant dispensed the plaintiff
from such fulfilment.  
<P>

457   	At p.244 Dixon CJ stated that the defendant's case rested
upon the plaintiff's failure to name a ship available for loading
in February
and to give fourteen days' notice of the ship and the shipping date.  
<P>

458   	At p.245 his Honour expressed the view that the plaintiff
was entitled to succeed on the ground that, in so far as there
was a
non-fulfilment of the condition requiring the nomination of a February ship and
the giving of fourteen days' notice of the
ship and shipping date, the
defendant dispensed the plaintiff from such fulfilment.  He continued:-
<P>

"In the Supreme Court the plaintiff failed because the case was treated as one
in which the contract had been kept open by the plaintiff
notwithstanding the
defendant's intimation of its inability to perform it, with the consequence
that the plaintiff was bound to fulfil
the conditions on its part to be
fulfilled.  But this is not a case confined to a simple anticipatory refusal to
perform or declaration
of inability to perform on the part of one party
followed by an election by the other not to treat the contract as discharged by
breach.  The course taken by the defendant involved something more than that
and the additional element brings into application other
principles of law.
The defendant persisted up to 2nd March that it could perform the contract only
in one way, namely by substituting
a shipment by the same vessel in Melbourne
for that in Sydney contracted for.  By seeking the plaintiff's help in an
attempt to effect
this substitution and at the same time persisting that it
could not perform the contract according to its terms the defendant clearly
intimated to the plaintiff that it was useless to pursue the conditions of the
contract applicable to the shipment in Sydney and
that the plaintiff need not
do so.  The fact that under the rules of law governing anticipatory breach of
contract, the plaintiff
might have elected to treat the defendant's intimation
as a discharge by breach may be disregarded.  The plaintiff did not do so
and
that left the contract on foot. But it left it on foot subject to a continued
intimation that only by substituted performance
could the defendant carry it
out, an intimation involving an attempt by all parties to effect the
substitution."
<P>

459   	His Honour then referred to the negotiations in relation
to shipment in Melbourne and, at pp.246-247, said:-
<P>

"Now long before the doctrine of anticipatory breach of contract was developed
it was always the law that, if a contracting party
prevented the fulfilment by
the opposite party to the contract of a condition precedent therein expressed
or implied, it was equal
to performance thereof: <i>Hotham v East India Co</i>.
But a plaintiff may be dispensed from performing a condition by the defendant
expressly or impliedly intimating that it is useless
for him to perform it and
requesting him not to do so.  If the plaintiff acts upon the intimation it is
just as effectual as actual
prevention."
<P>

460   	At p.250 Kitto J stated the relevant principle thus:-
<P>

"The principle, which applies whenever the promise of one party, A, is subject
to a condition to be fulfilled by the other party,
B, may, I think, be stated
as follows.  If, although B is ready and willing to perform the contract in all
respects on his part,
A absolutely refuses to carry out the contract, and
persists the refusal until a time arrives at which performance of his promise
would have been due if the condition had been fulfilled by B, A is liable to B
in damages for breach of promise although the condition
remains
unfulfilled."
<P>

461   	For present purposes Mr Bathurst submitted that the
statement by BKC that it would not consider further third party franchisees
acquitted HJPL, as a condition precedent to obtaining such approval, from
submitting names of such franchisees to BKC, thus making
BKC liable to HJPL in
damages for breach of its promise and notwithstanding that HJPL had not
submitted further prospective third
party franchisees to it.
<P>

462   	This submission was raised in the context of a submission
by BKC that neither HJPL itself nor through third party franchisees
was in a
position to open the restaurants within the required period even if there was
operational or financial approval.  This involved
both the point to which I
have just referred and a question of timing.  In relation to that question it
is quite artificial to consider
it other than in the context of BKC's refusal,
which made it otiose for HJPL to pursue third party franchisee recruitment.
Thus,
BKC cannot, for these purposes, take advantage of a situation which it
had created wrongfully.
<P>

463   	In Mahoney v Lindsay &amp; Ors  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%2055%20ALJR%20118" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 55 ALJR 118</a>
proceedings were brought for the specific performance of two contracts for the
sale of land.  A notice had been given to complete
on or before 30 June 1979
and the solicitor for the respondent purchasers gave uncontested evidence that
on 28 and 29 June 1979 he
telephoned and spoke to the solicitor for the
appellant/vendor seeking to make an appointment to complete, and that on each
occasion
he was told by that solicitor that he did not have instructions to
settle.  A decree for specific performance was made at first instance
and
upheld on appeal.  The appeal to the High Court was dismissed.  At p.119 Gibbs
J, with whom Stephen, Murphy, Aickin and Wilson
JJ agreed, cited the passage
from the judgment of the Chief Justice in Peter Turnbull at pp.246-247, and
noted the submission that
the appellant's solicitor "did not expressly intimate
that the appellant would not complete, or that it would be useless for the
respondents to make a tender".  His Honour concluded:-
<P>

"With all respect to that argument, I find it sufficient to say that in the
circumstances to which I have referred it was open to
the learned trial Judge
to infer that the appellant's solicitor, acting on behalf of the appellant, did
impliedly indicate that it
was useless for the respondents to attend with the
purchase money, since the appellant did not intend to perform his part of the
contracts.
<P>

I agree with the Court of Appeal that the appellant had dispensed the
respondents from fulfilment of the condition of the contracts
and that the
respondents were entitled to specific performance."

a contract for the sale of land was due to be completed on 22 June 1983, time
being of the essence.  A special condition required
the vendors to obtain
registration of a right of way before completion.  On 20 June 1983 the vendors'
solicitor told the purchasers'
solicitor that the vendors would not be able to
settle on 22 June 1983 because the right of way had not been registered.
Neither
party attempted to settle on that date and, on 24 June 1983, the
purchasers gave the vendors a Notice of Rescission.  The purchasers
claimed a
declaration that they had rescinded the contract and for a return of the
deposit.  The vendors contended that the Notice
of Rescission was invalid on
the ground that the purchasers were not ready and willing to complete on the
due date for want of funds
and it was found, at first instance, that they would
not have been able to complete on that date.  It was held that the purchasers'
Notice of Rescission was not invalid and that they were entitled to a return of
the deposit on a number of grounds.  Relevantly for
present purposes Peter
Turnbull was considered by Brennan J and Dawson J.  At p.419 Brennan J quoted
the passage from the judgment
of Kitto J, to which I have referred, and a
further passage and Mahoney v Lindsay.  At p.420 his Honour said:-
<P>

"A consensual variation of the contract may be the inference to be drawn in
some cases but, more frequently, the facts will show
no more than that the
party to whom the intimation is given abstains from tendering performance in
reliance on the intimation that
he need not trouble to perform and that it will
be useless for him to do so.  It would be inequitable for A, having induced B
to
abstain from tendering performance, to assert that B's failure to tender
performance when the time for completion arrives is a breach
of contract by B
or constitutes a failure to fulfil a condition on which A's obligation depends.
The basis on which a party is dispensed
from tendering performance is that an
equity is raised against the party giving the intimation which is satisfied by
treating him
as though he had prevented the innocent party from tendering
performance: see <i>Waltons Stores (Interstate) Limited v Maher</i>.   Such an
equity enures for the benefit of the party who has acted on the intimation,
but it does not impair the contractual obligation
of the party giving the
intimation."
<P>

465   	For all these reasons, I am of the view that BKC's
"blanket freeze" on third party recruitment was neither justified by the
terms
of the Development Agreement, nor by the factual matters to which I have
referred.  I am also satisfied that BKC's intimation
to HJPL that it would not
consider further third party franchisees dispensed HJPL of the necessity to
continue to tender performance.
 In the circumstances BKC was in breach of
contract by imposing the freeze.
<P>

The Withholding Of Financial Approval
<P>

466   	Mr Bathurst's submissions commenced that the requirement
for financial approval is specified as being that HJPL:-
<P>

".. has performed and is faithfully performing all terms and conditions under
each individual franchise agreement issued, and is
not in default of any money
obligations owed by Hungry Jack's to BKC.  Hungry Jack's acknowledges and
agrees that it is vital to
BKC's interests that a franchisee be financially
sound to avoid a business failure affecting the reputation and good name of the
Burger King marks."
<P>

467   	It was not in issue that HJPL was not in default of any
money obligation owed to BKC.  A minor qualification was Mr Miolla's
statement
that there was a difference of opinion, which arose after service of the March
1996 notices, about the correct rate of
franchise royalty which was payable.
However, it appears that nothing more was made of this, and, for present
purposes, nothing was
suggested to turn on it.
<P>

468   	Mr Bathurst's written submissions set out the financial
information provided by HJPL to BKC and noted that the first suggestion
that
HJPL was required to provide annual financial information to BKC arose in the
context of the drafting of Development Guidelines
in 1993 in relation to the
requirements of the "corporate plan" proposed by them.  HJPL proposed that its
company secretary would
submit a consolidated profit and loss statement on a
monthly basis, and a balance sheet on a quarterly basis.  Mr Miolla responded
that the requirement was for an annual non-consolidated balance sheet and
profit and loss statement, and such other financial information
as BKC should
reasonably request.
<P>

469   	BKC made its first request to HJPL for a financial review
in October 1994, which coincided with the allocation to Mrs Driscoll
of
responsibility for the Asia Pacific region.  Mrs Driscoll conceded that in
conducting this review she was aware there was a Development
Agreement, but did
not read it and no one explained the effect of it to her in relation to
approvals HJPL was required to obtain
to be granted franchise approval.  She
did not suggest that she was subsequently made aware of the provisions.
Accordingly, in so
far as the exercise of the "sole discretion" was conferred
on her, she was required to consider it unaided by knowledge of the contractual
obligations.  I regard that as a very strange state of affairs.
<P>

470   	In a memorandum dated 14 October 1994, copies of which
were forwarded to Messrs Gooden and Power, Mrs Driscoll told Mr Butler
she
needed further information to consider financial approval for the twenty eight
sites requested by HJPL for the 1995 financial
year.  The information was
sought:-
<P>

"In order to process the financial piece of the approval, I need Hungry Jack's
most recent fiscal year-end financial statements,
that include individual
restaurant P&amp;L's, a consolidated P&amp;L for the entire business, a
consolidated balance sheet and statement
of cash flows, as well as all
accompanying notes to the financial statements.  Also, if available, I would
need debt server schedule,
outlining the terms and the annual principal
payments and interest payments."
<P>

471   	Whilst this information went beyond any contemplated by
the Development Agreement or Guidelines, Mrs Driscoll said she did
not make any
enquiries about previous financial approvals for HJPL, although she knew it was
BKC's largest franchisee outside America.

<P>

472   	On 26 October 1994 Mr Butler sent her a copy of HJPL's
Special Purpose Financial Reports for the year ended 30 June 1994.
 They were
audited and prepared so that HJPL could comply with the requirements of the
Corporations Law, and were in the common form
prepared for subsidiaries the
accounts of which were required to be consolidated with the accounts of a
holding company.  Mrs Driscoll
made no enquiries about that and, when she
reviewed the accounts, she observed there was an operating profit of $1.1m,
retained profits
of $5.7m, shareholders' equity of approximately $16m, a
surplus of current assets over liabilities of $3m, and a surplus of non-current
assets over non-current liabilities of $9m.
<P>

473   	On 12 December 1994, Mrs Driscoll advised Messrs Gooden,
Miolla and Power that HJPL was financially approved in respect of
thirty four
sites, although that approval did not depend on any analysis peculiar to any
one of them. She stated that the basis of
her approval was:-
<P>

"As I indicated, Hungry Jack's is financially approved for the sites on the
attached list.  The financial approval was based on
my review of Hungry Jack's
Pty Limited Special Purpose Financial Reports as of June 1994 and the
representations made in John Butler's
letter to you dated December 5, 1994.
Significant reliance was placed upon all the members in that letter.  In
particular, I am relying
on the representation by Butler that Hungry Jack's Pty
Limited has no principal debt repayments."
<P>

474   	The approval granted in 1994 was based upon the
information Mrs Driscoll had received, which included knowledge that HJPL
was
part of the CFAL Group and that certain apportionments had been made in the
audited accounts based upon obligations owed, in
the first instance, by CFAL.
Mrs Driscoll directed any enquiries to Mr Butler, and she accepted his
responses and relied upon his
statements.  She required no independent
verification of his information.  BKC also took into account Fixed Charge
Coverage ratio,
(FCC), and the Debt to Equity ratio, (D:E).  Mr Power had
advised Mr Butler that the FCC was required to be a minimum of 1.15:1 or
higher, and the D:E was to be a maximum of 1.5:1 or less.
<P>

475   	Although Mrs Driscoll said initially in her evidence that
she informed Mr Power of those ratios for the purpose of his advising
Mr Butler
of them, and that those were the ratios used in considering HJPL's financial
position for expansion purposes in 1994, she
corrected that evidence to state
that she had used a FCC ratio of 1.20:1, although subsequently, on 5 December
1994, Mr Butler advised
Mr Power that the FCC ratio was 1.44:1 and the D:E
ratio was 1.24:1.  It is immediately apparent that even though the ratios were
thought to be significant by BKC, there was no consistency by it in its
approach to them.
<P>

476   	The position so far as late 1995 was concerned differed
from that to which I have just referred.  On 1 September 1995 Mr
Power sent a
facsimile transmission to Mr Butler stating that BCK wished to perform "the
annual financial review of" HJPL, and needed
a copy of the profit and loss
accounts and balance sheet "as well as details of all debt held by this
company".  Details of the debt
were sought.
<P>

477   	The question which then arose was the entitlement of BKC
to carry out an annual financial review of HJPL, rather than the
necessary
financial review when specific sites were proposed for approval.  Mr Miolla
said that Mr Power's memorandum of 1 September
1995 reflected BKC's practice of
reviewing the financial position of larger franchisees on an annual basis,
rather than undertaking
a financial review when specific sites were proposed
for approval.  This may have been BKC's practice, but it was not a contractual
entitlement.
<P>

478   	Mrs Driscoll said she was involved in considering HJPL's
financial position at that time because it had lodged an application
for
franchise approval in respect of sites which did not appear on the list of
thirty four sites approved by her in December 1994.
 There is some difficulty
in accepting this evidence because HJPL did not submit its application until 4
September 1995 and Mrs Driscoll
did not become aware of it until 8 September
1995, at the earliest.  Further, the financial approval granted in December
1994 was
expressed to be for twelve months and, accordingly, had not expired by
September 1995.  It was also submitted that the decision to
require an annual
financial review could not be justified as having been made in good faith, but
rather on the basis of "a stream
of information from Montgomery" as to what he
said was the "parlous financial situation of HJPL".
<P>

479   	There were a number of difficulties in relation to the
conduct of the "annual financial review", including the lack of connection
between it and specific sites for which HJPL had sought approval.  In any event
BKC concluded in October 1995 that HJPL probably
complied with its financial
requirements.  It does not appear that BKC was able to demonstrate that HJPL
had failed to meet the requirements
for financial approval but, notwithstanding
that, that approval was withheld.  The question which arose is why.
<P>

480   	On 12 September 1995 Mr Miolla wrote to Mr Cowin advising
him that HJPL had been financially disapproved.  The letter said,
inter
alia:-
<P>

"As you know, the terms of the Development Agreement prohibit HJPL from
expanding unless it submits annual, audited financial statements
which show
that it is in compliance with our financial requirements for expansion."
<P>

The Development Agreement contained no such provision.  Mr Miolla must have
been aware of that unless he had failed to read it and,
accordingly, for either
or both reasons the letter was putting forward an incorrect statement about the
terms of the Agreement. 
Once again the question must be asked as to why Mr
Miolla was misrepresenting the contractual requirements to HJPL.
<P>

481   	On 15 September 1995, Mr Cowin sent HJPL's 1995/96 budget
document to Mr Miolla, and, on 18 September 1995, Mr Montgomery
sent a
facsimile transmission to Mr Miolla advising that BKC should call for a full
financial report on HJPL's holding company, as
part of the process of "keeping
the pressure on" HJPL, and should not approve commencement of any new stores
until that had been
provided. BKC had no right to this financial information,
which, if Mr Montgomery's advice was followed, was being sought for an
ulterior
and improper purpose. On 20 September 1995, Mr Miolla wrote to Mr Cowin
stating:-
<P>

"Thank you for the recent pro forma budget and financial statements for HJPL.
Those will be useful in connection with the joint
venture discussions, although
the fiscal 1995 financial statements are the real hard data we need to move
forward.  This is true
with reference to both the joint venture and the pending
applications for expansion.  <u>As I have stated in my earlier letter, we
cannot approve any expansion until we have completed a financial review of the
actual audited
financial statements and you are not authorised under the terms
of the Development Agreement to commence construction at any of the
proposed
sites until we communicate such approval in writing</u>."  (My emphasis.)
<P>

482   	Mr Fitzjohn agreed that in substance this letter
prevented further development by HJPL unless BKC made exceptions; that he
would
have been consulted about the withholding of financial approval; and that such
a communication was a serious one to a franchisee
such as HJPL.  The letter, of
course, was completely consistent with Mr Miolla's acceptance of Mr
Montgomery's advice.
<P>

483   	Mr Power said it was Mr Miolla who took that decision and
that none of the matters which led to it were raised with Mr Cowin
or Mr
Butler.  This failure was extraordinary conduct on the part of BKC having
regard to Mr Cowin's position, and BKC's knowledge
that Mr Butler was HJPL's
main financial officer.  It points up the very strange way in which BKC was
acting.
<P>

484   	On 26 September 1995 Mr Cowin sent a copy of the draft
1995 HJPL accounts to Mr Miolla and, on 2 October 1995, Mr Montgomery
provided
further advice to Mr Miolla that BKC should choose its ground carefully and
bring on a confrontation with HJPL "sooner rather
than later".  He suggested
one of the matters on which there should be focus was HJPL's financial
capacity, and that BKC should not
grant it any further rights for new stores.
A copy of this facsimile transmission was provided to Messrs Fitzjohn and
Hothorn, and,
essentially, BKC followed this course.
<P>

485   	On 3 and 5 October 1995 Mr Miolla requested further
financial information from Mr Cowin at a time when he conceded in
cross-examination
that Mr Gooden and Mrs Driscoll were not sure whether HJPL
should be financially approved for expansion.  Mrs Driscoll said she did
not
have sufficient information to form a view whether HJPL complied with BKC's
financial ratios, although she was aware that some
development agreements set
timetables for expansion and that financial disapproval would prevent further
development.
<P>

486   	On 11 October 1995 Mr Cowin responded to Mr Miolla's
request for information and enclosed a memorandum from Mr Butler, which
concluded that HJPL satisfied BKC's ratios.  On 18 October 1995 Mr Miolla
sought further financial information, including a detailed
schedule of
inter-company information of the Competitive Foods Group.  He said that if a
detailed profit and loss statement was provided
he expected the Finance
Department would give exception approval for the additional sites at Myaree,
Hurstville and Bolivar, although
until the additional information was provided
no further expansion approvals would be granted.
<P>

487   	On 19 October 1995 Mr Butler sent Mr Miolla HJPL's
detailed profit and loss accounts for the financial years ended 30 June
1994
and 1995 and, on 20 October 1995, Mr Power sent a communication to Messrs
Miolla and Hothorn concerning HJPL's financial review.
 He said he understood
the conclusions drawn by Mr Gooden and others regarding probable compliance
with the ratios, but suggested
that other matters, to which he referred, should
not be overlooked, and added:-
<P>

"In our overall assessment of the condition and quality of operations of this
franchisee (HJPL) we would appear to have discretion
to still disapprove the
franchisee financially for expansion purposes."
<P>

He also recorded that Mr Horowitz had advised him that it appeared HJPL would
be disapproved for expansion operationally on 11 November
1995.
<P>

488   	Mr Power, whose objectivity in relation to HJPL was
doubted by Mr Fitzjohn, acknowledged in cross-examination that he was
worried
about the possible conclusion that HJPL properly complied with the ratios
because he thought that might lead to its obtaining
financial approval.  Whilst
he sought to deny that he was seeking to have BKC financially disapprove HJPL,
that denial was unconvincing
and I reject it.  Mr Power was well aware that if
financial approval was not granted that would cause HJPL "a dilemma" in that it
may not be able to fulfil the requirements to open a minimum number of
restaurants each year, with the consequences that entailed.
 I am also
satisfied that Messrs Fitzjohn and Miolla were well aware of the problems which
would be caused to HJPL.  The conduct
of BKC, in dealing in this way with a
long-term franchisee of considerable standing which had never been in breach of
any financial
obligations to it, was astounding.  In the end, I am forced to
the conclusion that it was in pursuance of a deliberate plan to prevent
HJPL
expanding, and to enable BKC to develop the Australian market unhindered by its
contractual arrangements with HJPL.  Therefore,
the conclusion to which I have
come is that in acting as it did, BKC failed to act reasonably or in good
faith, and was in breach
of the implied term to co-operate.  There was no
evidence which satisfies me that in so far as there was an exercise of the
"sole
discretion" in coming to the decision to withhold financial approval,
that that exercise was based on permissible facts to which
regard could be had
or carried out reasonably or in good faith.
<P>

489   	On 24 October 1995 Mrs Driscoll prepared a file note of
her review of HJPL's financial information in which she noted that
it met BKC's
required D:E ratio.  She raised a series of questions in relation to the way in
which debt and other inter-company charges
may give rise to financial issues,
such questions being essentially of a hypothetical nature, and notwithstanding
that none of those
hypothetical possibilities had caused her any difficulty in
dealing with the 1994 financial statements.
<P>

490   	On 26 October 1995 Mr Cowin met with Messrs Miolla and
Gooden and Mrs Driscoll in Miami.  There was specific discussion about
HJPL's
financial statement and some of Mrs Driscoll's hypothetical problems, and Mr
Cowin was told that BKC would not grant approval
for further expansion unless
HJPL provided specified financial information about the Competitive Foods
Group.  Questions were formulated
in a letter from Mr Gooden to Mr Cowin, which
was referred to Mr Butler for reply. 
<P>

491   	On 27 October 1995 Mr Miolla told Mr Cowin that HJPL
would be operationally disapproved for expansion from 18 November 1995,
even if
the issues concerning its financial approval were resolved.  This showed that
Mr Miolla was treating operational and financial
approval separately, which I
consider was correct, and the determination of BKC to achieve some disapproval,
which would prevent
HJPL's further development.  In my view, that was for the
reasons to which I have just referred.
<P>

492   	On 1 November 1995 Mr Power obtained a set of complete
accounts of the CFAL Group from Mr Montgomery, which he forwarded
to Mr Gooden.
Mr Power was well aware that Mr Montgomery had no authority to furnish him with
this information and he made it clear,
in sending it to BKC in Miami, that it
was "for internal consumption only" and could not "be referenced directly in
any discussions
with HJPL or CFAL".  The circumstances in which Mr Power came
into possession of this information, other than its being handed to
him by Mr
Montgomery, was not satisfactorily explained.  However, of more significance,
Mr Power was unable to explain and, in my
opinion, completely failed to
explain, his conduct in receiving the information, analysing it, and forwarding
it to BKC in Miami.
 He knew that Mr Montgomery was acting wrongly, and that he
was taking advantage deliberately of that wrongful conduct to further
BKC's
ends and to the detriment of HJPL.  He was closely cross-examined on this
conduct.  His evidence did him no credit and showed
the lengths to which he was
prepared to go to bring about, or seek to bring about, a result unfavourable to
HJPL.  His conduct, in
this regard, was discreditable.
<P>

493   	HJPL was never made aware that BKC had this information,
and there was no evidence of the use it made of it, save that Mr
Power made
some analysis of it.  Mrs Driscoll acknowledged that she received the documents
and said she may have perused them, but
she did no detailed work on them.
<P>

494   	Further information was furnished by Mr Butler on 6
November 1995 and, on 8 November 1995, Mr Fitzjohn wrote to Mr Cowin
requesting
a full package of information for the entire Competitive Foods Group.  He
advised that HJPL was not financially, operationally
or legally approved for
expansion.  He said the letter was drafted by Mr Miolla.
<P>

495   	On 19 December 1995 Mr Butler sent information to Mr
Gooden about the financial position of CFAL and inter-company loans
between it
and HJPL and, on 22 December 1995, Mr Miolla again advised Mr Cowin that HJPL
did not have financial approval under clause
4.1 of the Development
Agreement.
<P>

496   	On 29 December 1995 Mr Cowin sought confirmation from Mr
Miolla that all issues in relation to the provision of financial
information
had been resolved and financial approval had been granted, to which Mr Miolla
responded on 8 January 1996 stating that
approval would not be granted until
BKC received the consolidated financial statement package as previously advised
by Mr Fitzjohn.
 Thereafter there was further information provided and further
work was done on the accounts by Mrs Driscoll.  During the course
of this
dispute, particularly about whether ratios met BKC's requirements, Mrs Driscoll
conceded that BKC:-
<P>

".. may have, in fact, not been consistent in our communication to HJPL"
<P>

on that topic.
<P>

497   	Mrs Driscoll explained her concern in relation to the
1995 accounts by reference to the fact that the operating result had
fallen by
about $1.6m to a loss of some $81,000 from 30 June 1994 to 30 June 1995.  She
said this provided a "red flag", which necessitated
her investigating the
financial affairs of HJPL and the Competitive Foods Group much more closely.
The odd thing about BKC's approach,
which, in my opinion, is only explicable
because of the attitude BKC was taking to HJPL, is that the financial
disapproval preceded
the receipt of the various information, rather than
followed an analysis of it and the exercise of the discretion based on that
analysis.
 As will appear, the matters Mrs Driscoll regarded as a "red rag" and
which she used to try to justify her concerns was never one
she took up with
any officer of HJPL and, particularly, Mr Cowin or Mr Butler.  She sought no
direct explanation for the turnaround
in the profits.
<P>

498   	Mr Bathurst submitted that whilst BKC had a sole
discretion to grant or withhold approval that had to be exercised in accordance
with the requirements for financial approval, i.e. on the basis of the factual
material to which BKC was entitled, and reasonably.
 He submitted that in so
far as there was a necessity to perform all terms and conditions under each
individual franchise agreement,
that must mean, in the context of the
Development Agreement, all terms and conditions of a financial nature and,
further, that it
was not in issue that HJPL was not in default of any money
obligations.  He submitted that the acknowledgment and agreement in the
second
sentence of clause 4.1(b) could only affect the granting of further franchises
and that this was a matter governed by clause
7.1.
<P>

499   	Mr Bathurst submitted, Tpp.3916-3917, that HJPL's
obligations were to comply with its financial obligations under each Franchise
Agreement and, in the present case, there was no evidence that that had not
been done at a financial level. He continued that the
other way of reading it,
which is the way for which BKC contended, was that the matter of approval was
one entirely for the discretion
of BKC, such that it would not matter if none
of the events of default had arisen or appeared likely to arise.  Mr Bathurst
also
pointed to the fact that by intruding external considerations, such as
ratios, BKC was having regard to matters to which the Development
Agreement did
not refer.
<P>

500   	Mr Oslington submitted that the failure to obtain
financial approval was not relied upon as a ground of termination and that
clause 4.1 required HJPL to obtain franchise approval, and hence financial
approval for each restaurant to be established. But the
failure to develop, the
right to do which was dependent on, inter alia, financial approval, was relied
on in the Shorter Notice.
He continued that by September 1995 there were only
five restaurants for which franchise and site approval were being sought,
namely
Parramatta, Myaree, Bolivar, Broadway and Hurstville.  Further, no other
applications for franchise and site approvals to establish
restaurants were
made prior to the operational disapproval on 27 November 1995.  BKC contended
that the absence of financial approval
for four of the five restaurants had no
relevance to the breach of clause 2.1, and that the effect of operational
disapproval in
November 1995 prevented development, whether or not HJPL could
meet the other conditions necessary for it.
<P>

501   	Mr Oslington submitted that the meaning given to
"financial approval" in clause 4.1(b) required three conditions to be met:-
<P>

(a)	That HJPL had performed and was "currently" performing all terms and
conditions under each individual Franchise Agreement;
<P>

(b)	that there was no monetary default; and
<P>

(c)	the acknowledgment and agreement of HJPL in the third sentence of clause
4.1(b), which set out what was necessary to satisfy
the third requirement,
namely that HJPL be financially sound to avoid a business failure affecting the
reputation and good name of
the BKC marks.
<P>

502   	So far as (a) is concerned I have come to the conclusion
that, on a proper construction of the Development Agreement, reference
is being
made to compliance with financial requirements.  I am of that view because
operational approval is dependent upon HJPL's
conducting each of the
restaurants in accordance with the terms and conditions not only of the
Development Agreement, but the applicable
Franchise Agreements and the
standards, specifications and procedures specified in the Manual of Operating
Data.  To read the opening
words of clause 4.1(b) as replicating those words
does not seem to me to be justified, when the words appear under the heading
"Financial".
 Furthermore, it seems to me that the requirement of "faithful"
performance is more akin to the requirement of performance of financial
obligations than of operational obligations and, accordingly, there must be not
only that performance but also no existing default
of any money obligations.  A
somewhat similar situation arises when one has regard to legal approval.  The
concluding words require
that there be compliance "with all obligations under
all agreements with BKC".  If this is not confined to legal obligations it
merely
repeats, and this would be the argument put forward by BKC, compliance
with requirements for operational and financial approval.
<P>

503   	Accordingly, as a matter of construction, I reject Mr
Oslington's first submission.  The terms and conditions with which
there must
be compliance under clause 4.1(b) are those relating to financial matters.
<P>

504   	The second point is not in issue.  That raised in (c)
requires a construction of the second sentence of clause 4.1(b) which,
in my
opinion, it will not bear, namely that HJPL must establish that it is
"financially sound".  In my opinion, on its proper construction,
the sentence
is an acknowledgment and agreement by HJPL of the significance of "a
franchisee" being "financially sound", which adds
point to the necessity to
comply with the requirements in the first sentence, but which does not, on the
view I consider is preferable
as a matter of construction, impose any further
obligations on HJPL or the franchisee.  This construction is reinforced, at
least
to a not insubstantial extent, by the first sentence of clause 7.1.
<P>

505   	In these circumstances I am of the view that, as a matter
of contract, BKC was not entitled to the further financial information
it was
seeking.
<P>

506   	Mr Oslington's submissions continued that it was left to
BKC's "sole discretion" to decide whether HJPL was financially sound.
 However,
in exercising that discretion, assuming that it extends in the way for which Mr
Oslington contends, BKC must act reasonably
and in good faith.  I have referred
to the difficulties which, in my opinion, BKC has in establishing that it was
so acting.  Further,
as I have noted, the very matter which Mrs Driscoll said
caused her concern was not referred to any officer of HJPL, let alone Mr
Cowin
or Mr Butler.  She sought no explanation for the turn around in the profit
situation, which she conceded could have been explained
on a number of quite
appropriate bases.  If this was, in truth, a matter of such concern to her it
is inexplicable, in my opinion,
that she did not seek an explanation,
particularly as she realised that the absence of financial approval may well
impede further
development.
<P>

507   	In all the circumstances BKC has failed to satisfy me
that it was entitled to withhold financial approval from HJPL, and
that in
purporting to do so it acted either reasonably or in good faith.  Finally, the
evidence does not satisfy me that any officer
of BKC exercised the "sole
discretion", on the basis of facts to which he or she was entitled to have
regard, in withholding such
approval.
<P>

Withdrawal Of Operational Approval
<P>

508   	Under clause 4.1(a) HJPL "must have", as a condition of
the granting of a Franchise Approval, "in the sole discretion of
BKC",
operational approval.  "Operational" is stated as meaning that HJPL conducts
each of its Burger King restaurants in accordance
with the terms and conditions
of the Development Agreement, the applicable Franchise Agreements, and the
standards, specifications
and procedures specified in the volumes comprising
the Manual of Operating Data, as amended, including the maintenance of the
interior
and exterior of the restaurants to reflect an acceptable Burger King
image.
<P>

509   	The Development Agreement therefore reposes in BKC the
discretion, which is described as "the sole discretion", whether HJPL
will have
operational approval. These observations apply equally to financial approval.
I am uncertain whether the word "sole" adds
to the nature of the discretion, it
being BKC's discretion and, in so far as it may otherwise have been relevant to
consider the
point, it is only BKC, which can exercise the discretion.
However, in my opinion, it is clear that the discretion can only be exercised
conformably with the terms of the Development Agreement.  By that I mean that
it is not open for BKC to deny operational approval
unless it concludes, acting
reasonably and in good faith, that HJPL has failed to conduct each of the
restaurants in accordance with
clause 4.1(a).  Even if HJPL does not do so
there is no contractual obligation on BKC to deny operational approval.  BKC
retains
the discretion to decide whether it will or will not.  However, as I
have said, that discretion can only be exercised if the factual
basis
contemplated by clause 4.1(a) exists.
<P>

510   	In my opinion, there are several requirements to the
exercise of the discretion.  Firstly, BKC must have before it material
on which
it is able to exercise the discretion to operationally disapprove.  Secondly,
BKC must establish that based on that material
it exercised the discretion.
The fact that BKC may have before it material, which would entitle it to
exercise its discretion, does
not lead to the inevitable conclusion that if
there was operational disapproval, it was in consequence of that material.  In
my opinion,
it is necessary for there to be evidence from BKC to show that it
was on the basis of that material that it decided to operationally
disapprove.
Obviously, if BKC were to assert breaches of the requirements of clause 4.1(a)
and that in consequence of those breaches
it was operationally disapproving,
even if there were no reference to its doing so in its "sole discretion", the
reasonable inference
would be that it was exercising that discretion.  However,
in so far as it is relevant to establish that there has been operational
disapproval conformably with clause 4.1, it is necessary, in my opinion, for
BKC to prove each of the matters to which I have referred.
 This raises the
further point, namely, that if BKC fails to prove certain of the matters on
which it relied the onus remains on
it to show that if the matters it has
proved were the only matters to which it was entitled to have regard in
exercising its sole
discretion, those would have caused it, in its "sole
discretion", to operationally disapprove.
<P>

511   	The significance of these observations in this case is
that Mr Blauer has not been called to give evidence.  If all the matters
to
which he refers in his letter of 27 November 1995 are established then, for the
reasons I have given, the reasonable inference
would be that it was on the
basis of them that he exercised the discretion.  On the other hand, if any of
those matters are not proved,
so that the breaches are less than the ones on
which he purported to exercise BKC's sole discretion, the question becomes
whether
he would have exercised that discretion on behalf of BKC in the changed
circumstances.  Mr Bathurst's submission was that the factual
situation as
outlined in his letter did not exist and, even if some lesser breaches existed,
there was no evidence from him that
they would have been such as to cause him
to exercise BKC's sole discretion to deny operational approval.
<P>

512   	The matter is also significant because of Mr Oslington's
heavy reliance on the admissions made by Mr Green as to the state
of certain of
the restaurants.  Mr Oslington continued that those admissions were sufficient
to enable BKC to exercise its discretion
to operationally disapprove.  It may
be, and I put the matter no higher than this, that that is so.  However, Mr
Bathurst's submission,
with which I agree, is that there was no evidence from
BKC that it communicated knowledge of the matters of which Mr Green made his
admissions to Mr Blauer before he wrote his letter of 27 November 1995, nor
that he exercised, or anyone else from BKC exercised,
BKC's discretion on the
basis of those admissions.  Therefore, he submitted, the admissions became
irrelevant, with which I agree.
They do not assist in a consideration of what
Mr Blauer may have done in a different factual situation.
<P>

513   	It is now necessary to examine Mr Blauer's letter of 27
November 1995 with some care.  It refers to the Development Agreement
and BKC's
world-wide Expansion Policy regarding minimal operational standards necessary
to expand within the system, which it asserted
was delivered to HJPL "at the
beginning of this year".  It quotes clause 4.1(a) in terms which are
inaccurate, namely by stating
that it "provides that HJPL may not open
additional Hungry Jack's restaurants unless ...".  That overlooks the
requirement of BKC
to exercise its sole discretion in denying operational
approval, a matter which, on a reasonable reading of the letter, is addressed
in the next paragraph.  That paragraph gave some clues as to how BKC would
exercise the discretion:-
<P>

"Pursuant to the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lopa198/s4.1.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4.1(a)</a>, BKC has the authority to refuse to
approve any expansion by HJPL if HJPL fails to comply with the terms of a
single franchise agreement.
 Notwithstanding this requirement, BKC has, without
waiving its right to impose this standard in the future, agreed at this time
to
treat HJPL consistent with the less restrictive provisions of the Expansion
Policy."
<P>

Therefore, in so far as Mr Blauer was purporting to exercise the discretion, he
was doing so based on the provisions of the Expansion
Policy.
<P>

514   	The letter continued that, as HJPL knew, that policy
provided that a franchisee's eligibility for restaurant expansion in
the Burger
King system was dependent upon, among other things, "operational performance
pursuant to the terms of each franchise agreement".
 The letter referred to
HJPL's being subject to an operational assessment to determine its
expandability in accordance with the "Operational
Expansion Criteria", and, as
part of that assessment, to the categorisation of restaurants into "Superior",
"Satisfactory" or "Needs
Improvement".  It stated that those characterisations
were based on many factors and referred to discussions between Messrs Horowitz
and Green, and to the fact that pursuant to the Expansion Policy each
restaurant was evaluated on an ongoing basis "through FM visitations,
detailed
OT visitations, and average Mystery Shopper scores".   It is of significance
that there was an on-going evaluation based
on those matters.
<P>

515   	The letter continued:-
<P>

"When the Franchise Action Plan was initiated, there were approximately 36 HJPL
restaurants in the Needs Improvement category. 
At the end of the Franchise
Action Plan, there were still a total of 31 restaurants in the Needs
Improvement category.  A summary
of the major issues at these 31 restaurants is
enclosed.
<P>

Pursuant to the Expansion Policy, a franchisee may not expand if more than 10%
of its restaurants (are) in the Needs Improvement
category.  HJPL has more than
20% of its restaurants in the Needs Improvement category and is, therefore, in
violation of both the
Expansion Policy and the more restrictive provisions of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lopa198/s4.1.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 4.1(a)</a> of the Development Agreement.  Unfortunately, this means that at
this time HJPL is not approved for any further expansion.
<P>

Specifically, BKC will not grant any additional `Franchise' or `Site' approvals
as defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lopa198/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 4</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lopa198/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">5</a> of the Development Agreement, and you are in
default under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lopa198/s15.1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 15.1(b)</a> of the Development Agreement."
<P>

Clause 15.1(b) provided that an occurrence entitling BKC to terminate was:-
<P>

"(b)	Hungry Jack's fails at any time to meet and satisfy fully the operational,
financial and legal requirements set forth in clause
4, whether for the purpose
of seeking franchise approval or in the day-to-day operation of a Burger King
Restaurant."
<P>

516   	The letter stated that whilst clause 15.2 gave "only 30
days to cure this breach", that BKC was willing to discuss the matter
with a
view to reaching a solution over a longer period "if you are also interested".
I have referred to the terms of the March 1996
Notice, whereby this offer was
withdrawn.
<P>

517   	The letter concluded:-
<P>

"Jack, I believe that BKC has acted in good faith and substantially relaxed the
requirements of the Development Agreement in order
to work with HJPL in order
to improve operations.  There is, however, no question that there is an issue
which needs to be resolved
and I hope that the two companies can work together
in the near future to reposition HJPL so that it can continue to expand within
the Burger King system."
<P>

518   	Presumably the relaxation of the requirements of the
Development Agreement was the preparedness of BKC to rely upon the "less
restrictive provisions of the Expansion Policy".  The breach of that Policy was
that more than twenty per cent of HJPL's restaurants
were said to be in the
Needs Improvement category.  Mr Bathurst's submission was that that was the
stated reason for denying operational
approval, and that one could not, on a
fair reading of the letter, determine that another reason was the breach of the
more restrictive
provisions of clause 4.1(a).  I think that must be correct,
the whole thrust of the letter being that, at least at that time, BKC
was not
applying the clause 4.1(a) requirements as reflected by breaches of the
Expansion Policy.  Thus, so the submission ran, the
stated reason for the
exercise of the discretion was that more than twenty per cent  of the
restaurants were in the Needs Improvement
category and, unless BKC established
that to be so, there was no evidence that BKC had exercised its discretion on
any other basis.
<P>

519   	The memoranda from Mr Horowitz in relation to the
restaurant classifications, which were attached to Mr Blauer's letter,
showed
the classifications to have been done by Mr Horowitz during the period 27
October 1995 to 1 November 1995.
<P>

520   	Mr Bathurst conceded that the Expansion Policy was
applicable to its restaurants and was received by it in late 1994.  Relevantly,
it provided that if a franchisee had more than ten restaurants, no more than
ten per cent of them could fall within the Needs Improvement
category. At that
time HJPL had at least 140 restaurants, so that it would be in breach of the
guideline if 15 or more were properly
classified "Needs Improvement".
<P>

521   	The Expansion Policy provided the way in which a
Franchise Action Plan would be implemented and for all restaurants to be
re-evaluated "no less than once every six months based upon the (1) FM
visitations, (2) Detailed OT visitations, and (3) Average
Mystery Shopper
Score.  During the first quarter of every fiscal year, an action plan will be
established, and it will be reviewed
on an on-going basis.  The quality with
which the franchisee performs on each of these three factors will determine the
on-going
operational performance category".
<P>

522   	When Mr Horowitz met with Mr Green in February 1995 he
told him that 27 restaurants were classified "Needs Improvement".
 Mr Green was
initially somewhat unsure about the figure, but, in cross-examination, Tp.1008,
he became reasonably firm on the number
27, being clear that the percentage
exceed 10.
<P>

523   	Mr Green agreed that Mr Horowitz told him in February
1995 that he and Mr Green needed to come to an agreement as to how
long it
would take to get the restaurants below ten per cent of Needs Improvement, and
that he was "open to how much time in the
future" HJPL needed.  Mr Green asked
for eight weeks, and Mr Horowitz, he agreed, said that he, Mr Horowitz, thought
HJPL needed
"a lot longer than eight weeks to get anywhere near the target of
10% restaurants in NI".  Mr Green agreed that Mr Horowitz said:-
<P>

"I suggest that every three months we plan on moving 20% of the NI restaurants
into the `satisfactory' category.  That would mean
that in nine months, in
other words, by 15 November this year, we'd reach our goal of getting less than
10% restaurants NI."
<P>

Mr Green said he agreed with that and told Mr Horowitz of his agreement.
<P>

524   	However, Mr Horowitz told Mr Green at this meeting that
Mr Blauer had agreed that BKC:-
<P>

".. would delay in forcing that expansion policy letter in Australia until we
held a meeting with the franchisees and came to an
agreement as to what date
that letter would go into effect."
<P>

It was after that that he said to Mr Green that it was necessary to come to an
agreement as to how long it would take to get the
restaurants below ten percent
Needs Improvement.  No such meeting took place and no such communication was
received.
<P>

525   	Mr Horowitz did not prepare or provide a Franchise Action
Plan to Mr Green at the meeting in early 1995, the first time that
such a plan
was furnished to him being on 5 October 1995.
<P>

526   	The importance of when the Franchise Action Plan was
delivered is apparent from Mr Hothorn's communication to Messrs Power,
Horowitz
and Miolla of 4 June 1995, in which he referred to there being only three
categories in which a franchisee could be, namely
approved, needs improvement
with an action plan (able to expand), and disapproved.  He continued that in
the latter two cases the
franchisee was supposed to have a written plan for
what was necessary to become approved and asked to be advised if he had "this
wrong".  Mr Hothorn agreed in cross-examination that this was BKC's practice,
and he identified the Franchise Action Plan sent to
Mr Green by Mr Horowitz on
5 October 1995 as the type of written plan to which he had referred.  None had
been sent previously.
<P>

527   	Mr Bathurst pointed to the emphasis placed on the
Franchise Action Plan in Mr Blauer's letter of 27 November 1995 and to
the fact
that at its end "there was still a total of 31 restaurants in the Needs
Improvement category".  This, so Mr Bathurst submitted,
was a significant
factor in Mr Blauer's reasoning, and that the process of analysis as revealed
in the letter was consistent with
an application of BKC's practice as described
by Mr Hothorn, but the factual premise for it, namely the provision of such a
plan,
was missing.  However, Mr Bathurst submitted that as no Franchise Action
Plan was provided until 5 October 1995, it mattered not
whether Mr Blauer was
ignorant of that or chose to ignore it.
<P>

528   	Mr Bathurst submitted that the agreement of February 1995
could not be a substitute for a Franchise Action Plan because it
failed to
state "what is necessary in order to become approved". It was nothing more than
a general statement of what should occur.
In the result Mr Bathurst's
submission was that there was no Franchise Action Plan provided until 5 October
1995, Mr Horowitz gave
no evidence as to why this did not occur, Mr Blauer
apparently ignored the fact, and the annexures to the letter of 27 November
1995
made it clear that he was referring to matters of specificity, rather than
the generalities discussed in the February 1995 meeting.
<P>

529   	Mr Bathurst relied nextly on the failure by BKC to comply
with its restaurant visitation guidelines.  The documentation issued
by BKC
described what was to occur, the number of visitations necessary being
specified, relevantly for present purposes, in respect
of Needs Improvement
restaurants as ten occasions per annum, or one about every five weeks.  On 10
May 1995 Mr Blauer advised Mr
Cowin that he required HJPL's "new manager" to
perform an expanded visitation at all restaurants "at a frequency of two, four
or
six times depending on the operational status of the restaurant", and, on 14
July 1995, Mr Blauer, in referring to Mr Honkey, said
that he would conduct
visits:-
<P>

".. under the following minimum frequency which is two visits for Superior
restaurants, four visits for Satisfactory restaurants,
and six visits for Needs
Improvement restaurants."
<P>

The purpose of these visits was to check on the progress and improve operations
"through observation, training, coaching, motivating
and assisting; and
allocating our resources to those restaurants most in need".  Thus, it was
clearly contemplated that by carrying
out visits with the regularity specified
there would be an achievement of reducing restaurants in the Needs Improvement
category.
<P>

530   	Against this background HJPL considered the visits to the
31 restaurants classified as "Needs Improvement", upon the existence
of which
restaurants in that category Mr Blauer relied in his letter.  It was submitted
that if the visitation requirements for Needs
Improvement restaurants was not
met there were two available inferences, the first being that BKC was failing
to comply with its
policy, which included assisting restaurants to come out of
that category and thus not meeting the contractual obligations to co-operate
and act reasonably and in good faith, and the second being that BKC operators
did not regard the restaurants as being in the Needs
Improvement category any
longer in which event there was no basis for the adverse exercise of the
discretion.  The bases for these
submissions are set forth in paragraphs 25.20
to 25.23, and proceed on the assumption that Needs Improvement restaurants,
conformably
with the 1995 restaurant visitation guidelines, were to be visited
ten times per year or, approximately, once every six weeks.
<P>

531   	Mr Bathurst prepared a schedule based on the visitation
reports, (Volume 75 of the Tender Bundle), in which, in relation
to the 31
restaurants which Mr Blauer said caused him concern, he noted the records of
visitations.  The first restaurant, Arana
Hills, was visited on 24 March 1995
and not, so far as the evidence disclosed, thereafter until a visit by Mr
Horowitz shortly before
1 November 1995.  The second restaurant, Beak House,
was visited on 13 March 1995 and then, by Mr Horowitz, on an unspecified date
shortly before 1 November 1995.  Thus, in a period of some seven months, during
which one could have expected a visit, if the restaurant
was in the Needs
Improvement category, or if the visitation guidelines were being followed,
every six weeks or so, there were only
two visits.  Mr Bathurst also pointed to
the fact that only 16 of the 31 restaurants were visited in the three months
preceding the
Needs Improvement classification and from that the submission was
made that 15 of the restaurants could not have been considered
to be in the
Needs Improvement category or there had not been compliance by BKC with its
policy; a policy introduced for its benefit.
<P>

532   	In respect of the remaining 16 a table was prepared,
based on the visitation reports, which shows that Seaford and Shell
Kingsway
were only visited once each, Bulleen was only visited twice, Forest Hill,
Fulham, Glen Waverley, Hindley Street, Mount Gambier,
Oakleigh and Preston were
only visited on three occasions and, although no visitation reports are still
in existence for West Terrace,
it appears only to have been visited on three
occasions in the period February to October 1995.  The balance were visited on
four
or five occasions.  Mr Bathurst pointed also to the fact that of the 16
restaurants in this category only six were within the 27
classified in February
1995 as Needs Improvement.
<P>

533   	From this point Mr Bathurst submitted that an analysis of
6 of those 16 restaurants revealed that there were no more than
10 that could
properly be classified as Needs Improvement, i.e. less than the 15 necessary to
meet BKC's criteria.
<P>

534   	In paragraph 25.29 Mr Bathurst set forth his reasons for
submitting that Preston, Forest Hill, Seaford, Geelong, Shell Kingsway
and
Bulleen could not be rated as Needs Improvement.  Preston was visited on 26
September 1995 and an action plan was prepared. 
On 5 October 1995 Mr Horowitz
advised BKC Singapore that this restaurant was rated Satisfactory and there
were no subsequent visitations
to it.
<P>

535   	In his memorandum to Mr Green of 7 November 1995 it was
noted as a Needs Improvement restaurant, but no reason was set forth
for this,
nor was any explanation offered as to the change of approach.
<P>

536   	In relation to Forest Hill, Mrs Mary Felt rated it
Satisfactory on 17 September 1995 and there were no subsequent visitations,
so
far as the evidence disclosed, to it.  In his memorandum of 7 November 1995 Mr
Horowitz said it was to be re-classified to a Needs
Improvement basis,
according to his memorandum of 29 October 1995, on the "most recent visit"
which rated it Satisfactory.  The evidence
was that Mrs Felt was an experienced
OT and no explanation was offered as to why her assessment was changed.
<P>

537   	Geelong was last visited on 27 September 1995 and, on 5
October 1995, Mr Horowitz advised BKC Singapore that it was Satisfactory.
 Mr
Horowitz visited it on 2 November 1995, although he had written a report to Mr
Green on 28 October 1995 stating that there were
Needs Improvement issues.  On
7 November 1995 he advised that Geelong had been re-classified as Needs
Improvement, but no evidence
was given as to the basis for this and the
District Manager protested about it.
<P>

538   	On 5 October 1995 Mr Horowitz advised BKC Singapore that
Shell Kingsway was rated Satisfactory on the basis of a single visit
on 8
September 1995.  There were no subsequent visits and Mr Horowitz used the
restaurant for the purposes of training BKC staff
in its procedures.
None-the-less, in his memorandum of 31 October 1995 Mr Horowitz stated a Needs
Improvement classification was
applicable to it.
<P>

539   	I have only dealt with four of the six restaurants to
which Mr Bathurst drew attention.  I have done so because the uncontradicted
evidence is that shortly before Mr Horowitz prepared his memorandum to Mr
Blauer he had advised BKC Singapore that three of the restaurants
were
Satisfactory and, Mrs Felt had advised that one was Satisfactory.  Save for
Shell Kingsway, Mr Horowitz based his subsequent
assessments on the most recent
visitation reports which meant, of course, that he was contradicting views
either he or Mrs Felt had
previously expressed.  The analysis I have performed
reduces the number of restaurants in the Needs Improvement category from 16
to
12, i.e. below the necessary number and, even at this point, it cannot be said
that there was any justification, of the type Mr
Blauer asserted, for refusing
operational approval.
<P>

540   	Finally Mr Bathurst relied on the Mystery Shopper Scores,
with which he dealt in paragraphs 25.27 and .28.  Mr Blauer discontinued
this
programme in September 1995.  Mr Bathurst submitted that on a proper
interpretation of the scores, there was no basis for treating
many of the
restaurants as Needs Improvement, e.g. only 6 of the 31 had a Mystery Shopper
Score of less than 90%, and only 3 of the
16 referred to in Table A2 had a
score of less than 90%. 
<P>

541   	Mr Bathurst then dealt at some length with the evidence
of Mr Honkey.  However, for present purposes I do not find it necessary
to turn
to that evidence.  In my opinion, sufficient emerges from the evidence of BKC
to negate any suggestion that there were, as
at 27 November 1995, more than 12
restaurants in the Needs Improvement category.  Certainly, the evidence does
not support the assertion
made in the letter of 27 November 1995 that 31
restaurants were in that category.
<P>

542   	Mr Oslington submitted that I would find that, based upon
the condition of the restaurants, BKC was entitled to operationally
disapprove
HJPL because, as a matter of fact, at least one HJPL restaurant was failing to
comply with the BKC standards as at 13
November 1995, and because, if that be
rejected as a sufficient basis for operational disapproval, at least 10% of
restaurants conducted
by HJPL as at 13 November 1995 were "Needs Improvement".
If I may say so with respect, it seems to me that this submission asks the
wrong question.  The relevant question, as I have sought to point out, is
whether BKC relied on certain facts as the basis for exercising
its discretion
to operationally disapprove.  My analysis of Mr Blauer's letter of 27 November
1995 does not indicate any basis for
thinking, in fact the conclusion would
have to be to the contrary, that he exercised the discretion on the basis that
at least one
restaurant failed to comply with the BKC standards.  Secondly,
even I were of the view that he exercised his discretion on the basis
that at
least 10% of the restaurants were in the Needs Improvement category, the
evidence does not satisfy me that this was so. 
However, as I have sought to
explain, it seems to me more probable that the way in which Mr Blauer exercised
his discretion was on
the basis that more than 20% of the restaurants were in
that category.  In my opinion, on a proper reading of the letter, Mr Blauer
was
not directing his attention to how he would have exercised his discretion if
only 10% of the restaurants were in the Needs Improvement
category, but basing
it upon the greater percentage.  If that be wrong, I do not consider that the
objective facts establish the
basis on which he purported to exercise his
discretion.  However, I do not see that there is any need to speculate upon the
point.
 Mr Blauer, who exercised the discretion, was not called in the
circumstances to which I have referred.  Accordingly, there is no
evidence
before me as to how he would have exercised his discretion if he had been aware
of all the facts to which Mr Bathurst has
pointed and which, in my opinion,
have been established at a factual level.  He was available to be called, but
BKC chose not to
do so, and, in all these circumstances, there is no reason for
me to guess, nor do I consider I am entitled to, at what he may have
done had
he been aware of other factual circumstances, not the least of which would be
the failure to comply with the visitation
requirements; the statements by Mr
Horowitz, who was also not called, of his advice to BKC Singapore as to the
categorisation of
various of the restaurants; and the finding by Mrs Felt as to
one particular restaurant.
<P>

543   	Mr Oslington submitted nextly that BKC had afforded HJPL
an adequate opportunity to rectify the situation and imposed "the
less severe
10% Needs Improvement standard rather than insisting on its right under the
Development Agreement to deny operational
approval if one restaurant was
failing to comply".  The evidence is that HJPL had satisfied the
requirements.
<P>

544   	Mr Oslington nextly submitted that I would find that the
operational disapproval was not the product of a conscious and deliberate
attempt by BKC, I think the submission then is intended to mean to prevent
further development.  Even if I were to come to that conclusion,
I am satisfied
that BKC was not entitled, on the facts, to operationally disapprove BKC.
However, for the reasons I gave in considering
the withholding of financial
approval I do not consider that BKC acted reasonably and in good faith in this
regard.  In my view,
BKC was pursuing a course of attempting to thwart HJPL's
further development, so that BKC could develop the market without regard
to the
rights of HJPL.
<P>

545   	Mr Oslington submitted that I should find that the
operational disapproval was soundly based, as a matter of fact, on either
of
two grounds, they being that BKC conducted visitations throughout 1995 and 1996
and, in respect of both years during the relevant
ratings period, at least 10%
of the restaurants were in the Needs Improvement category; and that HJPL
accepted and acknowledged that
at least 10% of its restaurants were in that
category both as at November 1995 and November 1996, which was a serious
matter, as
Mr Green conceded.  Once again, if I may say so with great respect
to the careful submission, I think it misses the point, viz that
in so far as
there was operational disapproval one must know the facts upon the basis of
which the discretion was exercised.  I have
really dealt with the points made
in this submission earlier.
<P>

546   	Mr Oslington's submissions then dealt with the importance
of operational issues at some length with which there does not
appear to be any
great dispute.  The issue is, having regard to that importance, whether BKC was
entitled, on the facts as it has
demonstrated existed on 27 November 1995, to
exercise, through Mr Blauer, the discretion.  In my view it did not.
<P>

547   	Mr Oslington then turned to a consideration of the facts
and, in paragraph 43, seems to have conceded that 27 "if not more"
of HJPL's
150 restaurants were rated Needs Improvement by BKC in February 1995.   It is
to be noted that 31 restaurants, to which
Mr Blauer referred, is a shade in
excess of 20% of 150 restaurants, adding to the likelihood that that percentage
was the matter
to which he was having regard. The submission continued that on
this basis BKC could have operationally disapproved HJPL for expansion
at that
time.  Whether or not it could, it did not.  Rather, it chose to deal with
HJPL, at least initially, in a quite different
way.  His submissions then dealt
with the meeting in February 1995 and Mr Green's understanding that HJPL would
not be allowed to
expand if it had more than 10% of the restaurants in the
Needs Improvement category.  Mr Green regarded the matter as very, very
serious
and, after the conversation, took all actions which he thought necessary to get
the restaurants into a satisfactory condition.
 He accepted it was HJPL's
responsibility to keeps its restaurants operationally in order.  The submission
was made that no evidence
was called from any restaurant manager, district
manager, State manager or Mr Green to suggest that any form of plan was
introduced
into the system to ensure correction of what Mr Green regarded as a
very serious state of affairs.  In particular, Mr Oslington submitted,
no such
evidence was led concerning the period February to November 1995 or November
1995 to November 1996.  Nor, he submitted, was
any evidence called to suggest
that the matters recorded on the visitation reports during those periods were
not true.
<P>

548   	Mr Oslington submitted that Mr Horowitz' memorandum to Mr
Green of 7 November 1995 reflected the ratings immediately prior
to that date,
and that after receiving it it was Mr Green's evidence that he would have
contacted the State managers and asked them
the position in relation to action
plans.  He said he made no complaint to Mr Horowitz about the ratings, that he
knew himself the
general condition of those restaurants, that Mr Horowitz had
told him in February that BKC was likely to refuse expansion approval,
and,
therefore, it did not come as a surprise to him that it did so.
<P>

549   	As I have sought to show an analysis of the evidence
within the records of BKC, which, as an analysis, was not challenged
and which
I accept, showed that it had a different view of the situation.
<P>

550   	Mr Oslington's submissions then turned to the letter from
Mr Miolla of 7 November 1996 in which he advised Mr Cowin that
HJPL was still
not meeting the conditions for operational approval to expand as set forth in
the Development Agreement based on the
November 1996 ratings.  Mr Green agreed
he did not bring the number of restaurants below 10%.  This letter was followed
by the Notices
purporting to terminate the agreement on 18 November 1996.
<P>

551   	In reply Mr Bathurst submitted that having decided or
agreed to exercise the discretion given to it by clause 4.1 in a particular
way, it is not now open to BKC to argue that the discretion could have been
exercised in some other way, particularly where the alternative
basis now
proposed is one either rejected by the decision maker or which he or she does
not seek to support.  He referred to Mr Oslington's
submission, at Tp.4058,
that BKC, despite having a strategy in mind, did not enforce its full
contractual entitlement under clause
4.1(a) "but, instead, decided to judge the
plaintiff's operational standard on the basis that it wouldn't disapprove
unless more
than 10% of its restaurants were in the `Needs Improvement'.  It
applied that more lenient standard at the beginning of 1995, in
November 1995
and in November 1996".  Mr Oslington's submission pointed up the need for
acceptable evidence as to how the discretion
was exercised, and of evidence
entitling that exercise.
<P>

552   	In his submissions in reply Mr Bathurst also relied upon
the requirement of BKC, in exercising the discretion, to act "reasonably"
and
"in good faith" as explained in Alcatel Australia Limited v Scarcella.  These
requirements, in my opinion, necessitated that
Mr Blauer was aware of the
precise facts before exercising the discretion and that it be shown that he
acted on the basis of them.
 This was not done.
<P>

553   	Mr Oslington acknowledged in his submissions that there
was an obligation on BKC to review the status of restaurants, and
so much is
clear from the requirements for visitations.  By its Defence, paragraph 49.2,
BKC asserted, inter alia, that since 27
November 1995 and up to the date of
termination HJPL never met the requirements for operational approval.  The only
evidence it tendered
in support of that assertion, which Mr Bathurst described
as its positive case, were the admissions of Mr Green as to the percentage
of
stores which did not meet the Needs Improvement criteria.  However, the
submission is that this does not satisfy the establishment
of factual material
on the basis of which the sole discretion to refuse approval was based.  BKC,
having undertaken the proof of
that, no doubt to seek to avoid the consequences
of it, has simply failed to discharge the onus.  Mr Bathurst encapsulated the
submission
in paragraph 62 of his submissions in reply and, if I may say so
with respect, that essentially accords with the view to which I
have come, the
evidentiary bases necessary to support the view having been established.
<P>

554   	In the result I do not consider that BKC has established
that it was entitled, in its sole discretion, to operationally disapprove
HJPL.
I have already concluded that it was not justified in financially disapproving
it, and, in relation to both purported disapprovals,
what BKC's motivation
was.
<P>

HJPL's Readiness, Willingness And Ability
<P>

555   	The question which then arises is whether, if these
operational and financial disapprovals had not been put in place, HJPL
would,
in any event, have been ready, willing and able to comply with the requirements
of the Development Schedule.  Mr Oslington
submitted that HJPL has alleged in
paragraph 61(b) that it was, at all material times, ready, willing and able to
comply with clause
2.1, but was prevented from doing so by the wrongful refusal
of BKC to grant it financial and/or operational approval for further
expansion,
and that HJPL bears the onus of proving the allegation, which he submitted it
has failed to discharge.  Mr Oslington then
referred to the fact that HJPL may
itself have built the four restaurants in the relevant year in Western
Australia, South Australia
and Queensland, but that in November 1995 there was
"legitimate" operational disapproval, which was accepted by HJPL as such.  I
have found there was no "legitimate" operational disapproval, and the evidence
does not satisfy me that HJPL accepted that there
was.  However, Mr Oslington's
submissions continued that whether there was operational disapproval was not
relevant, because HJPL
was not in a position to, nor was it prepared to, nor
had it planned to open the four restaurants in the year November 1995 to
November
1996.  He referred to Mr Cowin's evidence that before September 1995
BKC had not refused any approvals sought to build new restaurants
and thus,
even if restaurants had been applied for, they were not constructed in the
period up to November 1996 with the exception
of Myaree.
<P>

556   	Mr Oslington referred to the evidence of Mr Cowin that
the average time to open a free-standing restaurant would be in the
range of
eighteen months, although each site had to be evaluated on the basis of its
degree of difficulty.  He noted that Mr Montgomery
was not called, and that Mr
McCarthy was of the view that third party franchisee applicants generally took
twelve to eighteen months
after approval of an application to open a
restaurant.  He referred to Mr Mazzone's having informed Mr Power in about
March 1995
that under normal circumstances eighteen months would be an
acceptable time frame for HJPL to open a restaurant, but that there were
times
when that was insufficient due to circumstances beyond its control.  The
conclusion from these submissions was that HJPL itself
had no plans to open
company restaurants in a sufficient time to enable it to comply with its
obligations under clause 2.1 and, in
the alternative, it could not have
complied with those obligations by introducing third party franchisees and
having them develop
and open the required number of restaurants within the
required time.  The required time, for the purposes of these submissions,
was
that provided by clause 2.1, not that provided by clause 8.1.  For the reasons
I have given, I do not consider that is correct.
<P>

557   	Mr Oslington referred to Mr McCarthy's evidence at
Tp.1859 in which he had agreed that it was unlikely in the extreme, as
at
August 1995, that any third party franchisee stores would be opened in
Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia by the
end of 1996, and to
his evidence at Tp.1930 in which he agreed it was unlikely in the extreme that
any third party franchisee stores
would open in those States at least by the
end of April 1996, and, he repeated, it was "most unlikely" that any third
party franchisee
restaurants would open in those three States by the end of
1996.
<P>

558   	Mr Oslington's submissions went on to deal with the files
which were kept on prospective sites and to Mr McCarthy's evidence
that the
best way of assessing whether HJPL was likely to open a restaurant was to look
at particular files.  He also referred to
Mr McCarthy's evidence of tracking
reports as reliable guides to the restaurants on the "drawing board", and to
the fact that no
attempt was made by HJPL to put into evidence those files and
no analysis of any files or tracking reports was attempted.  Mr Oslington
submitted that the quarterly reports, which dealt, inter alia, with
development, did not indicate that the required number of restaurants
would be
built in 1996.  
<P>

559   	I admitted Mr McCarthy's evidence in paragraph 104 as to
the number of restaurants which, in his opinion, would have been
opened.  Mr
Oslington submitted that minimal weight should be given to this evidence for
reasons upon which he subsequently elaborated.
 He also referred to the absence
of any evidence from Mr McCarthy of the financial ability to open the
stores.
<P>

560   	In paragraph 104 of his witness statement of 28 January
1998, Exhibit S, Mr McCarthy said that on 30 May 1994 he sent a memorandum
to
Mr Miolla, with a copy to Mr Cowin and Mr Montgomery, enclosing HJPL's
Development Plan and its Recruitment Plan for third party
franchisees.  He said
he believed, in relation to Queensland, that he had a good knowledge and
understanding of its property market
and, in his opinion, it offered a prospect
of substantial growth in the number of Hungry Jack's outlets.  His experience
was that
the development process took about six to twelve months from the time
that a site was investigated by HJPL until it was put forward
for active
consideration and, accordingly, he was conservative in his projections for the
years from 1996 onwards, because the process
of locating possible sites for
opening stores in those years would be unlikely to start for another twelve to
eighteen months after
he had prepared his Development Plan.  He noted that of
the eight stores referred to in that plan HJPL opened three, and he expressed
the opinion, to which objection was taken, that had it not been denied approval
to expand from 1995 onwards, it and franchisees introduced
by HJPL would have
opened at least the number of stores he had set out in that plan for
Queensland.  In respect of Western Australia
he gave similar evidence, although
he regarded it as mature market for HJPL.  He was of the view that if BKC had
not denied HJPL
approval to expand from 1995 onwards, HJPL and franchisees
introduced by it would have opened at least the number of stores shown
on the
Development Plan for Western Australia.  He expressed the same view in relation
to four stores projected in that plan for
South Australia.
<P>

561   	Mr Bathurst submitted that BKC correctly acknowledged
that HJPL could satisfy its obligations under clause 2.1 either by
building
company owned restaurants or by third party franchisee restaurants opened in
Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland.
<P>

562   	A very real question arose as to whether Mr McCarthy's
evidence of the number of restaurants, which he considered would be
built,
should be accepted.  In his submissions in chief Mr Bathurst referred,
paragraph 9.4 et seq, to Mr McCarthy's being cross-examined
about the various
ways in which HJPL could have satisfied the Development Schedule.  Mr Bathurst
noted that the reports to the quarterly
meetings, which were prepared by Mr
Montgomery and into which Mr McCarthy had some input, were said by Mr McCarthy
not to represent
a complete statement of HJPL's development activities.  His
evidence in cross-examination in this regard was quoted.
<P>

563   	Nextly Mr Bathurst referred to Mr McCarthy's
cross-examination of the likelihood of third party franchisees opening
restaurants
in Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland by the end of
1996.  He was asked those questions on the basis of those who
had made a formal
application by August 1995, and he said that there were none approved from any
of those States and that it was
fair to say that it was unlikely in the
extreme, as at August 1995, that any third party franchisee stores would be
opened in Western
Australia, South Australia and Queensland by the end of 1996.
Mr Bathurst criticised reliance on this evidence on the basis that
it was
limited to franchisees who had made a formal application by August 1995, which
question excluded potential applicants who
had not reached the point of lodging
a formal application, although they may have been in discussions and known to
HJPL for some
time, and on the basis that it also excluded any persons, who
subsequently approached HJPL after August 1995, who would have met
the
criteria.  Mr Bathurst referred to Mr McCarthy's evidence that, as a rule of
thumb, it was fair to say that if an applicant,
not being an existing third
party franchisee, completed the formal application and ultimately built the
restaurant, it would by and
large be open "following the formal application" in
twelve to eighteen months.  Mr Bathurst also submitted that August 1995 was "an
artificial date in relation to third party franchisees" because of the
imposition of the freeze on them in May 1995.
<P>

564   	I have difficulty in reconciling Mr McCarthy's evidence
that, even on the basis on which he was cross-examined, it was fair
to say that
it was unlikely in the extreme, as at August 1995, that any third party
franchisee stores would be opened in Western
Australia, South Australia and
Queensland by the end of 1996, with the submission that other restaurants and
those for which formal
approval may have been given, would have been, although
the time frame has to be considered, at least by me, in the context of clause
8.1.  If the evidence had remained at that point then I consider that there is
much force in Mr Oslington's criticism of it and of
his submissions that
minimal weight should be given to the opinion having regard to Mr McCarthy's
failure to look to files, tracking
reports, and the financial ability of HJPL
to pursue the opening of third party franchisee restaurants.  Mr Oslington
submitted that
on a true analysis of those documents Mr McCarthy's opinion was
shown to be wrong.  However, I think that all that has to be read
in the light
of two particular matters.  Firstly, the freeze put in place in May 1995.  Mr
Oslington seeks to deal with that in paragraphs
74, 75, 76 and 77 of his
written submissions and on the more detailed submissions in relation to
damages.  In my opinion, it is not
possible to divorce that event from the
apparent problems so far as third party franchisees were concerned.  I consider
that BKC's
attitude in this regard was in breach of the agreement and, for the
reasons I have given, that HJPL was acquitted from tendering
further
performance in relation to that aspect of the matter.
<P>

565   	Mr Bathurst also relied upon the failure to cross-examine
Mr McCarthy on his opinion stated in paragraph 104, on the basis
of the
documents to which he did not have regard.  To put it more directly Mr Bathurst
submitted that it was not open to indirectly
challenge Mr McCarthy's evidence
in paragraph 104 by having him agree that he had not looked at documents such
as site files and
tracking reports and that to make the submission permissible
Mr Oslington was obliged to put to Mr McCarthy that a consideration
of those
documents and, I would include, the quarterly reports, meant that his opinion
could not have been correct.  If that had
been done, so Mr Bathurst submitted,
Mr McCarthy would have been able to either explain the situation, or,
alternatively, acknowledge
the correctness of the proposition put in
cross-examination.  The relevant principles, generally said to be derived from
the decision
of the House of Lords in Browne v Dunn (1894) 6 R 67, were dealt
with at length by Hunt J in Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Limited
v Commissioner
of Taxation  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 NSWLR 1.</a> 
<P>

566   	At p.16 his Honour said:-
<P>

"First and foremost, however, there is one answer to the Commissioner's
submission which raises an important question of practice
that was debated at
some length during the final addresses at the hearing.   It arises from the
fact that at no time did counsel
for the Commissioner put to any of the
taxpayer's witnesses in cross-examination the so-called `staged development'
theory upon which
his client so strongly relies to contradict their evidence
denying any dominant purpose in the acquisition of each of the properties
to
re-sell it at a profit, nor did he give any notice that such was the case he
would be seeking to make.  It certainly was not a
case which should have been
apparent without such express notice.  
<P>

It has in my experience always been a rule of professional practice that,
unless notice has already clearly been given of the cross-examiner's
intention
to rely upon such matters, it is necessary to put to an opponent's witness in
cross-examination the nature of the case
upon which it is proposed to rely in
contradiction of his evidence, particularly where that case relies upon
inferences to be drawn
from other evidence in the proceedings.  Such a rule of
practice is necessary both to give the witness the opportunity to deal with
that other evidence, or the inferences to be drawn from it, and to allow the
other party the opportunity to call evidence either
to corroborate that
explanation or to contradict the inference sought to be drawn.  That rule of
practice follows from what I have
always believed to be rules of conduct which
are essential to fair play at the trial and which are generally regarded as
being established
by the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Browne v Dunn</i>
..."
<P>

567   	The principle, if I may say so with respect, is probably
not in doubt.  The question is how, in any particular case, regard
is to be had
to it.  The evidence of Mr McCarthy was that, in his opinion, a certain number
of stores would have been opened by third
party franchisees in Western
Australia, South Australia and Queensland.  It was relevant, at least on the
view of the case put forward
by Mr Oslington, that that should have been done
by November 1996, although that is a view I reject.  I do not think that the
cross-examination
of Mr McCarthy to which I have referred could have left
anyone in any doubt that Mr Oslington was attacking that opinion and that
he
obtained a concession from Mr McCarthy that it was "unlikely in the extreme as
of August 1995" that any such restaurants would
have been opened in those
States by the end of 1996.  Mr McCarthy's answer was unqualified.  The further
cross-examination in relation
to the lack of formal applications also made
clear the position Mr Oslington was seeking to achieve.
<P>

568   	In my opinion, the cross-examination went sufficiently
far to comply with the requirements of Browne v Dunn.  There were
no objections
to the questions on the basis that they were unfair or did not put the position
in an appropriate way.  Mr Oslington
chose to rely on August 1995 as the date
and, in any event, he had made it clear by his cross-examination on the failure
to refer
to other documents, that he was attacking the opinion based upon
contemporaneous evidence.
<P>

569   	At that point, I consider that the obligation was upon Mr
Bathurst to re-examine Mr McCarthy to ascertain whether the information
in the
reports may have caused him to change his view and whether the selection of
August 1995 was, in his opinion, an inappropriate
starting date to consider the
matter.  It is one thing to make submissions about this, it is quite another to
grasp the evidentiary
nettle when the point has been raised and seek to
re-examine the witness.  I am not concerned, at this stage, whether the
evidence
would have been admissible as evidence in reply, my prima facie view
being it would have been, because I was never called upon to
determine that.
The position was that Mr Oslington left the matter in a state where, in my
opinion at least on a prima facie level,
Mr McCarthy could have been
re-examined to establish that the particular circumstances about which he had
been asked did not cause
him to change his opinion.  This was not done and, in
my view, the cross-examination of Mr McCarthy, unexplained by any further
evidence
as to the particular circumstances which then existed, substantially
eroded his opinion.  
<P>

The Evidence Of Mr Cowin
<P>

570   	I have set out the steps taken by Mr Cowin to develop the
business of HJPL and the extent to which he had been successful.
 There can be
no real doubt that from a very modest beginning Mr Cowin developed HJPL into a
large and, generally speaking, successful
company.  It has been operating now
for some thirty years.  It has built up an extensive business network
throughout Australia. 
It appears to have the support of its shareholders and,
notwithstanding some suggestions in the evidence to the contrary, generally
speaking of its bankers.  Whilst attempts were made by BKC to attack HJPL's
financial  and business position, they were, in my opinion,
unsuccessful and
inconsistent with the probabilities.  BKC continued to operate with HJPL until
it gave the Notices of Termination
of 18 November 1996.  Whilst they were
directed to both the Development and the Service Agreements, they did not
purport to terminate
the Franchise Agreements and, ultimately, no attempt was
made to maintain that the Service Agreement had been terminated.  Accordingly,
even if BKC had been successful in maintaining that the Development Agreement
had been terminated, the position would have remained
that there would still
have been contractual arrangements under the Service and Franchise Agreements.
This would have meant, obviously,
continuing commercial relationships between
the two companies.
<P>

571   	BKC's putting HJPL forward as a suitable provider of
services to Shell was, in my view, totally inconsistent with the view
it has
subsequently sought to propound about HJPL's inability to manage its affairs.
HJPL's ability, in that regard, is well illustrated
by the absence of any
evidence to suggest that at any time it was in breach of any of its financial
obligations to BKC.  So far as
its financial position was concerned, this
matter was well illustrated by the inability of BKC, when it was seeking to
withhold financial
approval, to put forward any real grounds, and certainly not
to put forward any ground supported by the Development Agreement, why
HJPL
should not have financial approval.
<P>

572   	HJPL's success is, in my opinion, based on the business
acumen of Mr Cowin.  He has built the company up and is obviously
determined to
see it continue to grow.  He gave evidence over a lengthy period, during which
I had the opportunity to observe him
closely.  He impressed me as a hard, but
fair, businessman with an excellent knowledge of the affairs of HJPL and a
clear determination
and vision as to how it should be run in the future.
Correspondence emanating from him showed a full appreciation of the issues at
a
commercial level, and an ability to deal with them effectively at that level.
I have no doubt that Mr Cowin was a truthful witness,
who, on the evidence
before me, was defending the position of HJPL against what I have concluded
were the unjustified actions of
BKC in seeking to terminate the Development
Agreement and to create a freeze on third party franchisee recruitment and to
withhold
operational and financial approval to enable further development.
Whilst these actions may have achieved BKC's ultimate end of gaining
a greater
control over the Australian market they were, for the reasons to which I have
referred, unjustified in law, and Mr Cowin
was dealing with that situation in
as an effective manner as he could, whilst still maintaining the business.
<P>

573   	Mr Cowin's overall knowledge and understanding of HJPL's
business and the potential for development was immense and should
be afforded
the greatest weight.  He understood, having run the business for so many years,
how it could develop within a viable
financial framework and it is his
evidence, which, in my opinion, provides the greatest insight into the way in
which the business
of HJPL would have continued to develop, but for the
unjustified actions of BKC.
<P>

574   	In his statement of 29 March 1999, which is part of
Exhibit Q, Mr Cowin dealt with HJPL's development.  In paragraph 9 of
that
statement he referred to paragraph 179 of his witness statement of 29 January
1998, which was not read.  In paragraph 10 he
referred to the restaurants
opened throughout Australia for the years 1990/1991 to 1994/1995.  In Western
Australia, South Australia
and Queensland nine were opened in 1990/1991, two
were opened in 1991/1992, four were opened in 1992/1993, four were opened in
1993/1994,
and eight were opened in 1994/1995.  In total, throughout Australia
during that period, 53 restaurants were opened, an average of
10.6 per year.
Mr Cowin was not cross-examined to suggest that these figures were inaccurate.

<P>

575   	In paragraphs 11 and 12 he referred to Mr McCarthy's
Development Plan dated 30 May 1994, which set out the number of third
party
franchisees Mr McCarthy anticipated would open restaurants for the period
1994/1995 - 1998/1999.  On page 9 of that Development
Plan Mr McCarthy
estimated the number of restaurants which would be opened by HJPL and third
party franchisees in each State over
the period and, in relation to this, Mr
Cowin expressed the opinion that the projection on that page that 17 company
owned restaurants
would be opened in the financial year 1995/1996 "was
realistic", that the projected expansion of nine or ten stores per year for
the
years 1996/1997 - 1998/1999 "was very conservative", and he continued:-
<P>

"11.	In my opinion, HJPL would have opened at least seventeen company-owned
restaurants per year in the years 1996/97 and thereafter,
if it had not been
disapproved for expansion by BKC.  A development rate at that level is
equivalent to opening approximately three
restaurants in each year in each of
the markets in which HJPL operated (Western Australia; South Australia;
Queensland; Victoria;
and New South Wales).
<P>

  12.	In my opinion, of the seventeen stores per year which would have been
opened by HJPL in the financial year 1995/6 and following
years, HJPL would
have opened a large number of company stores in each year in NSW/ACT and
Queensland and a lesser number of stores
in Victoria, South Australia and
Western Australia in each year.  In my opinion an average of four company-owned
stores a year in
each of Queensland and New South Wales, and three
company-owned stores a year in each of Victoria, South Australia and Western
Australia,
would have been realistic.  In 1995/6, HJPL would also have opened a
`Hungry Jack's' restaurant in Palmerston, Northern Territory,
at a site which
it had acquired for that purpose."
<P>

576   	In paragraph 19, he referred to page 9 of Annexure C and
advanced the view "that the figures which are projected for third
party
franchisees in that Development Plan are realistic".  He supported that by
noting that from August 1995 to December 1998 there
were 14 restaurants opened
by franchisees introduced by HJPL to BKC, at a time when BKC only permitted
third party franchisees, which
had been previously introduced to open
restaurants.   The projected number from the year 1994-5 to 1998-9 was 85 or an
average of
17 per year.
<P>

577   	On 9 June 1999, Mr Cowin made a further statement, which
is part of Exhibit U, in which he set out his financial position.
 In paragraph
9 he stated:- 
<P>

"If HJPL had not been able to fund the opening of the new `Hungry Jack's'
stores, by bank finance for the cost of acquisition of
such properties or by
the leasing of premises on which the store had been opened, and by internal
finance for or lease of equipment
for the store, I would, either personally or
through proprietary companies associated with me, have been prepared to make
further
funds available to HJPL or its parent company by way of equity
investment or loan, to fund that expansion."
<P>

This statement following a very detailed analysis by Mr Cowin of his extensive
financial interests and of his borrowings.  No objection
was taken to any of
this evidence and Mr Cowin was not cross-examined on it.
<P>

578   	Notwithstanding the view to which I have come about the
evidence of Mr McCarthy, the evidence of Mr Cowin has to be considered.
 In my
view, Mr Cowin, for the reasons I have sought to explain, was in a far better
position to assess the ability of HJPL to expand
and, not only was he dealing
with third party franchisees but also with expansion through company-owned
restaurants.  He had a vastly
superior knowledge and understanding of the
business, both as a whole and generally, to Mr McCarthy and, it seems to me
that his
evidence is highly persuasive.  It becomes the more so as it was not
challenged.
<P>

579   	In paragraph 36.11 of his written submissions, Mr
Bathurst made the potent point that Mr Cowin was not cross-examined on
any of
this evidence.  In paragraph 36.15 of his written submissions Mr Bathurst dealt
with BKC's contention that HJPL would not
have been in a position to fund
expansion of 17 stores per year in the period from August 1995.  He conceded it
was common ground
that in mid-1995,CFAL was suffering a decline in
profitability, which had given rise to concern on the part of its lenders.  He
noted
that Mr Cowin acknowledged that CFAL was then having problems with its
banks as a result of a price war within the industry, which
led HJPL to make a
strategic decision to increase advertising expenditure, resulting in a
reduction in its profitability.  He also
referred to Mr Cowin's acknowledgment
that its Victorian business was not making money at that time, and
continued:-
<P>

"However, Cowin's evidence was that, while the profitability of HJPL had
declined in mid-1995, the cash flow of the business was
almost the same as it
had been in previous years, and that he had advised the banks that the decline
in profit reflected the strategy
adopted by CFAL to compete against large
companies in the market-place (Cowin xx 1390).  Cowin's evidence was that CFAL
then had
a borrowing capacity of approximately $100m from the banks, against
$150m of assets, and had borrowed $50-51m at the peak; and that
HJPL could have
readily gone into the market-place and sold another $50m of real estate,
against which CFAL would have paid back
a portion of debt to the bank."
<P>

580   	Mr Bathurst referred to Mr Butler's evidence that CFAL
had a need for additional short-term funding from Westpac and National
Australia Bank in mid-1995, because of the amount of capital spent on building
new stores and a substantial land purchase at Morley
Shopping Centre in
November 1994, which had resulted in a possible shortage of working capital. Mr
Butler was concerned about a cash
flow shortage and the likelihood of
receivership, although his evidence was that a receivership could only have
arisen if CFAL's
banks had not been prepared to authorise property sales or the
grant of the lease facility sought by CFAL, and that that was not
likely to and
did not occur.  His submissions noted that both Mr Cowin and Mr Butler denied
that HJPL would have ceased expansion
and that they stated that, having regard
to the financial provisions in place, HJPL would have funded the expansion at
the rate of
17 stores per year.
<P>

581   	At paragraph 36.25 Mr Bathurst referred to the evidence
that Mr Cowin was willing and able personally to fund the expansion.
 He noted
the internal memorandum from National Australia Bank of 29 June 1995, which
recorded his "strong commitment" to the CFAL
Group and his advise that he would
be prepared to sell his large holding in the owner of Channel 10 to fund
capital expenditure by
the CFAL Group from 1996, had that been necessary.  Mr
Cowin was not challenged in cross-examination on this evidence.
<P>

582   	It seems to me that it is also necessary to have regard
to what has occurred since 1995-1996.  Admittedly, because of the
restrictions
placed on it by BKC, HJPL has not been able to open new restaurants or obtain
further third party franchisees, with
some very limited exceptions.  However,
there was no suggestion that in that period HJPL has continued to suffer any
financial embarrassment
or difficulty, and the simple facts are that there is
the unchallenged evidence of Mr Cowin as to his estimate of the rate at which
restaurants would have been opened, and as to how they would have been financed
if HJPL had been unable to do so, which was unchallenged.
<P>

583   	The claim HJPL has made is a lost opportunity claim,
namely that it has been wrongly delayed in opening 17 company-owned
restaurants
per year from September 1995, and that it has not had approval for 17 third
party franchisee operated restaurants per
year.  The claim, as submitted by Mr
Bathurst, is formulated on the basis that HJPL would have opened new
restaurants progressively
after 31 December 1996 to "make up" for the lost
restaurants and, in calculating its loss, it has assumed that the "lost" and
"make
up" restaurants would have had a 20 year franchise term.
<P>

584   	Mr Oslington submitted that HJPL has failed to prove an
intention to open new restaurants after 1995, and he has pointed
to Mr Cowin's
evidence that before September 1995 BKC had not refused any approval sought to
build new restaurants.  He has noted
the National Development Reports, which
were prepared by Mr Montgomery in consultation with Mr Cowin, and the
significant number
of restaurants reported as being under consideration in the
August 1995 Development Report as being consistent with a decision having
been
taken by HJPL, at least by August 1995, to significantly curtail further
expansion.
<P>

585   	Mr Oslington submitted that even if HJPL had proved there
were no financial constraints on opening new restaurants, and that
it would
have been able to obtain the approvals required under clause 4.1, which it is
submitted it has not done, the assumption
of 17 restaurants per annum upon
which the damages are assessed has not been made good, and the validity of the
assumption is denied
by an historical analysis of forecasts and store openings.
He submitted that the reliable and cogent evidence which could establish
HJPL's
intention and/or ability to open new restaurants was in the hands of HJPL "and
it was not called".  He referred to the detailed
files, which were not
tendered; and the absence of evidence from Mr Montgomery, the National
Development Manager, which, for reasons
to which I shall refer, I do not regard
as significant.  In these circumstances he submitted that HJPL had failed to
prove it would
have opened 17 restaurants per year, and:-
<P>

"This is the only assumption about the number of new restaurant openings
incorporated into Mr Gower's model.  Mr Gower has not modelled
the damages (if
any) which would flow if different assumptions about restaurant openings are
made."
<P>

Mr Gower was the expert accountant called on behalf of HJPL.  Mr Oslington's
submission, in this regard, was that the case made
by HJPL was 17 restaurants
"or nothing".  I do not agree that that is the way in which damages have to be
assessed.  
<P>

Opportunity Loss
<P>

586   	In looking at an opportunity loss the plaintiff is
entitled to take a basis on which it alleges it has suffered loss.  The
defendant is entitled to say that that loss has not been established and,
indeed, that no loss has been established.  However, the
fact that the
plaintiff may have asserted loss at a certain level and the defendant may have
asserted no loss does not mean that
the Court can only determine which of those
two extremes is correct.  The Court's function is to decide the amount of
damages which
it considers the plaintiff has sustained.  It is not correct, as
a matter of law, to say that unless the Court can find the highest
case for
which the plaintiff contends, the Court cannot award damages for such loss as
the evidence supports, the onus, of course,
being on the plaintiff.  No doubt
recognising this, Mr Oslington submitted that if the view was taken that HJPL
may have opened some
new restaurants if the Development Agreement had remained
on foot, the number of restaurants and the States in which they would have
been
opened "is left to speculation".  It was submitted that it was left to
speculation due to the failure of HJPL to call material
evidence in HJPL's
possession, namely the files, or within HJPL's power to call, namely through Mr
Montgomery.
<P>

587   	The submission continued:-
<P>

"All HJPL has done, through Mr McCarthy, is prove Mr McCarthy's 1994
projections, and given some evidence, of little weight, about
the availability
of restaurant sites in various States.  If some new restaurants may have opened
in some years after 1997, there
has been no attempt by HJPL to prove which of
seventeen restaurants distributed between the States in Mr Gower's model would
have
remained."
<P>

588   	A submission such as this, in a case in which I have
found that the inability to open new restaurants was the fault of BKC,
has, if
I may say so with respect, a somewhat hollow ring.  Further, it is not correct,
in my opinion, to say that HJPL had relied
only on Mr McCarthy's evidence.
There was a deal of evidence from Mr Cowin, to which I have referred, which was
not challenged in
cross-examination, and, for the reasons I have stated, Mr
Cowin was the person in the best position to give such evidence.
<P>

589   	Mr Oslington's submissions then moved to HJPL's financial
ability to open new restaurants.  He submitted the most telling
reason to
demonstrate its inability flowed from a comparison of the 1995/1996 budget
given to the banks in April 1995 and the actual
expenditure during that
financial year.  Mr Oslington referred to the evidence of Mr Butler, which
stated that the restaurants to
be opened were determined by Mr Cowin and Mr
Montgomery and, ultimately, Mr Cowin approved the various development plans.
Mr Oslington
pointed to the fact that the business plan given to the banks in
April 1995 forecast 15 restaurants opening during 1995/1996 at a
total cost of
$7.07m, and 12 new restaurants opening in 1996/1997.  Reference was made to a
possible concession made by Mr Butler
that there may not have been enough money
to engage in opening the number of new outlets included in the 1995/1996
business plan
given to the banks by August 1995, and a fairly detailed analysis
was made of his evidence about the moneys available.  Emphasis
was placed upon
the fact that the bulk of the available capital was spent on refurbishments and
miscellaneous equipment replacement.
 
<P>

590   	Whilst Mr Butler's evidence, together with that appearing
in memoranda from Westpac and National Australia Bank, was subjected
to careful
scrutiny, I do not consider it went beyond the concession made by Mr Bathurst
and, in any event, the diary note of National
Australia Bank of 21 June 1995
showed that steps were to be taken "until such time that trends have been
arrested".  This was hardly
evidence of some terminal financial condition
within HJPL or the Group.  The financial position of HJPL and the CFAL Group
was considered
in some detail and, at p.259 of the written submissions, Mr
Oslington referred to paragraph 9 of Mr Cowin's statement of 9 June 1999.
 He
said if the matters referred to in that paragraph were truthful "new
restaurants would have been included in the 1996/1997 budget,
unless Mr Cowin
knew operational approval could not be achieved".  This, if I may say so with
respect, is speculative.  By that time
BKC was asserting operational
disapproval and withholding financial approval and, by about this time, it was
purporting to terminate
the Development Agreement.  In these circumstances, Mr
Cowin's evidence had to deal with the position which then existed in
consequence
of BKC's actions.  Mr Cowin was disputing the right of BKC to act
as it was.  However, critical to this is the failure by Mr Oslington
to
cross-examine Mr Cowin to seek to make good these various propositions.  I have
referred to the position in relation to Mr McCarthy.
 In my view, there was a
clear obligation to cross-examine Mr Cowin on this evidence if the submissions
now relied upon were to be
made. 
<P>

591   	This point is further made in Mr Oslington's submission
that the statement of 9 June 1999 was put on after the commencement
of the
hearing and was the first time Mr Cowin made reference to any such
preparedness.  However, he was not cross-examined on it.
 Further, it was
submitted that notwithstanding Mr Cowin's major equity in a number of private
companies "whose accounts reveal significant
wealth", no attempt was made to
demonstrate how that wealth could or would have been accessed to fund HJPL or
to demonstrate the
terms upon which such funding would have been made
available.  None-the-less, the evidence of Mr Cowin was that this was his
intention
and, notwithstanding all the submissions which were made in relation
to that, it was not a matter on which he was cross-examined.
 In my view,
consistently with the principles enunciated in Browne v Dunn as explained in
Allied Pastoral Holdings, there was an
obligation to cross-examine Mr Cowin on
these points if the submissions upon which reliance is now placed were to be
made.  This
is pointed out in the last submission:-
<P>

"If Mr Cowin intended to make funds available for development, new restaurants
would have been forecast in the 1996/1997 budget.
 They were not."
<P>

592   	In my opinion, it is not open for such a submission to be
made in the absence of cross-examination.  Mr Cowin may have had
a number of
explanations, such as the operational disapproval, together with the freeze on
third party franchisees as reasons for
not including these matters in that
budget.  He may have been concerned about commercial confidences.  He was never
afforded the
opportunity, notwithstanding his evidence as to his intention, to
explain any of those matters.  More importantly, his stated intention
was not
challenged.  His evidence could not be suggested as so improbable or
extraordinary as not warranting any credence, and that
submission was not made.
In those circumstances, I have come to the conclusion that in the absence of
any cross-examination of Mr
Cowin on these points there is no reason why his
evidence should not be accepted.  For the reasons to which I have referred, it
was
inherently probable.
<P>

593   	Mr Oslington's submissions continued that HJPL has not
established any readiness, willingness or ability to open any new
company
restaurants if the Development Agreement had remained on foot.  In my view this
submission must be rejected.  He continued
that if that submission was not
accepted, and HJPL would have opened some new restaurants, it had not
established a readiness, willingness
and ability to have opened any new
restaurants for at least the first two to three years after August 1995 "if for
no other reasons
than that HJPL has not proved it could have obtained
operational approval, nor has it proved it had money to open new restaurants
for at least the first two-three years".  From this submission it flowed that
the number of restaurants was a matter of speculation
and had not been proved
and, of course, there was continued reference to the absence of approvals under
clause 4.1.
<P>

594   	From this point Mr Oslington's submissions continued that
Mr Gower's evidence was only capable of establishing "any damage"
if the
assumptions upon which his model was based were established, and he submitted
that two critical assumptions were the number
of restaurants to be opened each
year and in what States and the discount rates.  He said that the models did
not enable damages
to be assessed if changes were made to either of those
assumptions.  He continued that HJPL had not attempted to prove a method,
which
enabled me to find whether any damage had been suffered, and if so, how much if
different assumptions were used, because his
report only addressed the case
"which HJPL chose to put".  He continued that it was open to HJPL to attempt to
prove damage on different
assumptions or by a different method, and it could
only be concluded that HJPL deliberately chose not to do so, and that neither
Mr Gower nor Mr Bryant, the expert accountant called on behalf of BKC,
suggested that damages on different assumptions could be arrived
at through
some process of extrapolation of the damages derived on the assumptions used by
Mr Gower.
<P>

595   	I shall return to a consideration of these submissions
when I come to consider the amount of damages.  At the moment that
with which I
am concerned is whether there is evidence on the basis of which it can be
stated that HJPL would, but for the operational
disapproval, the withholding of
financial approval, the freeze on the recruitment of third party franchisees,
and the purported terminations
of the Development Agreement, have been able to
continue with expansion.  The onus is on HJPL to establish these matters.  In
my
opinion it has discharged that onus.  Firstly, it has proved that over the
period from about 1969 there had been continuing development
by way of the
opening of restaurants by HJPL and third party franchisees introduced by it.
Secondly, it has proved that that situation
continued through the 1990's until,
at least, the various actions of BKC to which I have just referred.  Thirdly,
it has proved that
but for those actions that development would have continued
although, in due course, I will have to look to see whether it would
have
continued at the same rate and, if not, whether it is permissible to accept
another rate.  Fourthly, notwithstanding such financial
problems as HJPL was
suffering in 1995, I am not satisfied that these were insuperable and, in any
event, I am satisfied that had
it been possible to continue to open restaurants
Mr Cowin would have provided finance.  Fifthly, the probabilities are all in
favour
of the conclusions to which I have come.  Not only had HJPL been
involved in this business for many years prior to the mid-1990's,
but there was
absolutely no rational reason why it would not continue to remain in it.  It
was obviously quite lucrative and HJPL
had a massive amount of capital tied up
in it.  It had, through the various agreements with BKC, favourable franchise
fee arrangements,
and a business which BKC was seeking to either take over or
have someone else take over.  Sixthly, the business has continued, and
on any
view of the evidence, would have continued through the Service Agreement and
existing franchisees.  It has been continued
in circumstances where BKC has,
totally without justification, in my view, sought to hinder and thwart it.
When one considers each
of these matters, particularly taken in aggregate,
there is no rational reason or explanation for HJPL wishing to abandon the
business.
 Finally, if that had been its desire, the evidence is that there was
ample opportunity for Mr Cowin to have entered into an agreement
to sell out
either to BKC or to a party BKC considered more favourably. 
<P>

596   	In its submissions in reply, HJPL dealt, commencing at
paragraph 188, with the assumption of 17 restaurants per year from
August 1995.
After referring to Mr McCarthy's evidence, the submissions turned to the
evidence of Mr Cowin and to his being "the
guiding mind and will of HJPL" and
the person "ultimately responsible for making all business decisions on its
behalf".  The submission
was made, which I consider to be correct, that Mr
Cowin had to be challenged on his relevant evidence and that he had not
been.
<P>

597   	It was submitted that the 17 restaurant assumption was
supported by HJPL's having opened 16 during 1996, by the prior history
of
restaurant openings, and by Mr Gower's evidence that that assumption was not
inconsistent with the ten year moving average for
HJPL's restaurant openings as
shown in Appendix C4 to Mr Bryant's report.  Mr Bryant, who criticised the
assumption, acknowledged
that such criticism was based on the limited material
provided to him by BKC's solicitors.  The submissions then referred to the
fact
that BKC was looking at the position in the light of the breaches it had
committed, rather than having regard to what would
have occurred but for them.
A telling comparison was drawn from the figures prepared by BKC to demonstrate
the extent of HJPL's expansion
and its success in recruiting third party
franchisees, prior to BKC's impugned conduct.  On the other hand Mr Oslington
pointed to
the fact that the history of restaurant openings did not support Mr
Cowin's forecasts in relation to company owned restaurants and,
more
particularly, company owned restaurants combined with those opened by third
party franchisees.  Whilst this submission was made,
it was not based on any
cross-examination of Mr Cowin seeking to erode the forecasts or to make it
appear unlikely that the forecasts
would be met.
<P>

The Issues On The Computation Of Damages
<P>

598   	A number of reports on the suggested methods of
calculating damages were submitted by Mr Gower and Mr Bryant.  There were
differences in the assumptions made and the methodologies adopted by them and,
in an attempt to narrow the issues, I requested them
to prepare an Agreed
Statement, which they did, it being dated 9 July 1999 and becoming Exhibit U.
However, to a not insubstantial
extent, this statement highlighted the
differences between them, rather than narrowing to any great extent the issues.
I do not say
this critically, indeed I would wish to express my appreciation
for the attempts by Mr Gower and Mr Bryant to provide a more easily
understood
method of calculating damages.  It will be appreciated that their reports were
lengthy and had appended to them various
models and schedules.
<P>

599   	I think a convenient starting point for determining the
differences between the parties on the issue of damages is to have
regard to Mr
Oslington's submissions.  I have referred to his written submissions.  At
Tp.4190, he commenced his oral address.  He
referred to p.243 of his written
submissions and noted that the first claim to which attention was paid was that
for damages arising
from the loss of opportunity to open restaurants.  He
submitted, and this was accepted by HJPL, that it was not a claim that the
restaurants were lost forever, but a claim that their openings would be delayed
by five years, which is the lost opportunity calling
for an assessment of
damages.
<P>

600   	The fundamental submissions of BKC were that the
Development Agreement was duly terminated or, if it was not, HJPL had failed
to
prove any damage, because it had failed to prove that it was entitled to
development approval and its readiness, willingness and
ability to proceed with
restaurant development.  The submission then was that Mr Gower had modelled his
damages on the basis of 17
restaurants being opened each year, and that he had
not provided, nor been asked to provide, a formula or a method by which I could
determine whether or not any damage was suffered if a different number of
restaurants was opened each year.
<P>

601   	This submission was developed, as it had been in the
written submissions, by asserting that damages could not be assessed
unless the
assumptions made by Mr Gower, particularly as to the opening of 17 restaurants
each year, was made good.  It is convenient
to deal with this submission
immediately.  As I understand it Mr Oslington was submitting that HJPL set out
to prove a case based
on the opening of 17 restaurants each year and that if
HJPL failed to prove, as a matter of probability, that HJPL would have opened
17 restaurants each year, it had failed to prove <u>any</u> damage.
Accordingly, if I am of the view that 17 restaurants would not have been
opened, but a lesser number of restaurants may have
been opened, it would not
be open to me to award damages because the model provided by Mr Gower did not
accommodate a lesser number
of restaurants.
<P>

602   	The task, which confronts me, is to consider whether HJPL
has established that but for the breaches of BKC it would have
opened
restaurants, and that as a consequence of not being able to do so it has
suffered loss for which it should be compensated,
i.e. that it should be
compensated for the lost opportunity to open those restaurants, although it is
accepted that it will, in the
future, on the hypothesis on which I am now
proceeding, be able to do so.  Thus the damages are restricted, at least to
some extent,
by the loss of opportunity to open the restaurants from 1995 to
2000, and the deprivation of income, which allegedly would have been
earned in
that period. 
<P>

603   	In Malec v J.C. Hutton Pty Limited <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20638" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 169 CLR 638</a>,
Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said, at pp.642-643:-
<P>

"When liability has been established and a common law court has to assess
damages, its approach to events that allegedly would have
occurred, but cannot
now occur, or that allegedly might occur, is different from its approach to
events which allegedly have occurred.
 A common law court determines on the
balance of probabilities whether an event has occurred.  If the probability of
the event having
occurred is greater than it not having occurred, the
occurrence of the event is treated as certain; if the probability of it having
occurred is less than it not having occurred, it is treated as not having
occurred."
<P>

604   	In the present case I am not asked to determine whether
the opening of further restaurants "has occurred", but whether that
event
"would have, but cannot now occur" during the period for which damages are
sought or "allegedly might occur" at a later period.
<P>

605   	Their Honours continued:-
<P>

"But in the case of an event which it is alleged would or would not have
occurred, or might or might not yet occur, the approach
of the court is
different.  The future may be predicted and the hypothetical may be
conjectured.  But questions as to the future
or hypothetical effect of physical
injury or degeneration are not commonly susceptible of scientific demonstration
or proof.  If
the law is to take account of future or hypothetical events in
assessing damages, it can only do so in terms of the degree of probability
of
those events occurring.  The probability may be very high - 99.9% - or very low
- 0.1%.  But unless the chance is so low as to
be regarded as speculative - say
less than 1% - or so high as to be practically certain - say 99% - the court
will take that chance
into account in assessing the damages.  Where proof is
necessarily unattainable, it would be unfair to treat as certain a prediction
which has a 51% probability of occurring, but to ignore altogether a prediction
which has a 49% probability of occurring.  Thus,
the court assesses the degree
of probability that an event would have occurred, or might occur, and adjusts
its award of damages
to reflect the degree of probability.  The adjustment may
increase or decrease the amount of damages otherwise to be awarded.  ...
 The
approach is the same whether it is alleged that the event would have occurred
before or might have occurred after the assessment
of damages takes place."
<P>

At pp.644-645 their Honours said:-
<P>

"Secondly, in determining the chance that unemployability as the result of his
back condition would have precipitated a similar
neurotic condition, it is
necessary to bear in mind that more than one probability is involved.  There is
the degree of probability
that the plaintiff would have become unemployable in
any event as the result of his back condition and there is the degree of
probability
that the happening of that occurrence would have precipitated a
neurotic condition.  When those two possibilities are combined, the
chance that
the plaintiff would develop a neurotic condition decreases exponentially.  If,
for example, and only by way of illustration,
there was a 75 per cent
probability of his becoming unemployable by reason of his back condition even
if he had not contracted brucellosis
and a 75 per cent chance that that
unemployability would have caused a similar neurotic condition, there was only
a 56.25 per cent
chance (75 per cent x 75 per cent) that, if he had not
contracted brucellosis, he would have developed a similar neurotic
condition."
<P>

Their Honours concluded, p.645, that whilst the plaintiff was entitled to
damages on the basis that the neurotic condition was a
direct result of the
defendant's negligence, those damages had to be reduced "to take account of the
chance that factors, unconnected
with the defendant's negligence, might have
brought about the onset of a similar neurotic condition".
<P>

606   	In the present case I consider that the probability is
that HJPL would have continued to develop restaurants, but for the
breach by
BKC. However, I cannot be "practically certain", to the extent of 99 per cent,
that such development would have proceeded,
over each of the five years, at the
rate of 17 restaurants per year.  Therefore, I must take the chance that it
would not have into
account.  The fact that I am satisfied, on the balance of
probabilities, that HJPL would have proceeded to develop restaurants, does
not
entitle it, as a matter of law, to all the damages it claims on the hypothesis
that it would have developed 17 restaurants each
year, because I must assess
that there was a risk that that might not have happened, such adjustment
reflecting the chance that factors
unconnected with the breach might have
precluded its happening.  At that point the relevant principle is re-stated by
Mason CJ, Dawson,
Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Sellars v Adelaide Petroleum NL
&amp; Ors <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20179%20CLR%20332" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 179 CLR 332</a> at p.355:-
<P>

"However, in a case such as the present, the applicant shows <u>some </u>loss
or damage was sustained by demonstrating that the contravening conduct caused
the loss of a commercial opportunity which had
<u>some</u> value (not being a
negligible value), the value being ascertained by reference to the degree of
probabilities or possibilities."
<P>

607   	Their Honours said that the "all or nothing outcome
produced by the civil standard of proof would result in the vast majority
of
cases in over-compensation or under-compensation", and that the approach
conformed to the "long-standing practice of taking into
account contingencies
in the assessment of damages".
<P>

608   	In this case, I am satisfied, on the balance of
probabilities, that HJPL would have continued to develop.  However, as I
understand the principle, it is not open, unless I am at least 99 per cent
sure, to award HJPL all the damages it would have suffered,
as if that
hypothesis had come to pass.  Therefore, I must assess a figure to take into
account the vicissitudes or contingencies
to which the damages award must be
subjected.
<P>

609   	This question, in a context more akin to the present
case, was considered recently by the Court of Appeal in Tszyu v Fightvision
Pty
Limited &amp; Anor  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/323.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWCA 323</a> (13 September 1999).  In that case a boxing
fight promoter sought damages from, inter alios, a boxer, on the basis that but
for his
breach of contract he would have continued to fight in circumstances
where the fight promoter would have derived income.  The Court
was necessarily
confronted with the question as to what would have occurred but for the breach
by the boxer of his contract, which
involved considerations of the number of
fights in which the boxer would have engaged, the profits which would have been
derived
from them, the amount to which the promoter would have been entitled
from them, and, of course, the inherent vicissitudes and contingencies
that the
underlying circumstances would have transpired necessary to enable the boxer to
have engaged in such fights before crowds
and in circumstances where other
income would have been derived which would support the damages claimed.
<P>

610   	The Court, Sheller, Stein and Giles JJA, dealt with the
attack on the trial Judge's findings of fact on damages in some detail,
commencing their remarks by repeating that mere difficulty in estimating
damages does not relieve a Court from the responsibility
of doing so as best it
can: para 111.  In that case the trial Judge did not make an adjustment by
having regard to a percentage figure
to reflect vicissitudes and contingencies.
He did, however, reduce certain of the plaintiff's claims.  Presumably, in each
case it
is a matter of judgment.
<P>

611   	At paragraph 138 their Honours referred to the passage in
Malec, which I have cited, and, in paragraph 139, they said:-
<P>

"The context was assessment of damages in tort for loss of earning capacity,
but the principle is the same in the assessment of
damages for loss of profits
in consequence of breach of contract (<i>The Commonwealth v Amman Aviation Pty
Limited</i> at 88,104, 116-226) and of contravention of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices
Act</i> 1974</a> (Cth) (<i>Sellars v Adelaide Petroleum NL </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20179%20CLR%20332" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 179 CLR 332</a>
at 349-355).  The effect of this approach to past hypothetical situations on
causation of loss, as distinct from assessment of damages,
was considered in
this Court in <i>Daniels v Anderson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2037%20NSWLR%20438" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 37 NSWLR 438</a> at 527-531.
Applying what the High Court had said in <i>Sellars v Adelaide Petroleum NL</i>
at 353 and 355, Clarke and Sheller JJA, with whom Powell JA agreed on this
point, said (at 531) `The issue of causation should be
approached on the basis
of proof upon the balance of probabilities with the qualification that an
assessment of whether the chance
which is said to have been lost had a value is
to be made upon the possibilities or probabilities of the case.'  Causation
does not
arise in the present case."
<P>

612   	It was not suggested by Mr Oslington that if the breaches
alleged against BKC were found to exist they were not, save in
the way to which
I have referred, causative of the loss.  I am satisfied on the balance of
probabilities, that the breaches were
causative of loss because, I am satisfied
to the same degree, that HJPL would have continued to open new restaurants.
<P>

613   	At paragraphs 140 and 141 their Honours said:-
<P>

"140	It would have been erroneous to apply a balance of probabilities test to
the programme and the earnings, treating as certain
the past hypothetical
events of promotion or co-operation by Fightvision of bouts in which Mr Tszyu
participated and earnings from
those bouts as put forward in the evidence of Mr
Mordey if satisfied on the balance of probabilities that those events would
have
occurred.  That would have then been unfair to the defendants, because it
would have treated as certain a prediction of events with
a 51% probability of
occurring.  It would equally have been unfair to Fightvision to have ignored
the events altogether, and so awarded
no damages, if the prediction of their
occurrence was given only a 49% probability.  The correct approach, given the
causation of
loss was not in issue and the task was to assess the damages for
loss of the commercial opportunity of promoting or co-promoting
fights in which
Mr Tszyu participated, was according to the degree of possibility or
probability of such bouts occurring and bringing
earnings as claimed.
<P>

  141	It is not essential, however, in making an assessment of damages of this
kind, to express a percentage possibility or probability
of the occurrence of
the events necessary for the claimed lost profits, here the number of fights
and the amounts of earnings."
<P>

Paragraph 141 was said in the context of the findings by the trial Judge in
that case.  Their Honours were not suggesting, as I
understand it, that such an
approach was not permissible.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the test
traditionally applied.
<P>

614   	Their Honours then quoted with approval from the decision
in Norris v Blake (No 2)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2041%20NSWLR%2049" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 41 NSWLR 49</a>, the passage in the judgment of
Clarke JA, with whom Handley and Sheller JJA agreed, at p.67:-
<P>

"Where a valuation of a loss has to be made and the extent of the loss depends
upon an uncertain event, which has not occurred by
the time the evaluation is
made, such evaluation must be made by reference to the chance of the event
occurring, and not by reference
to whether or not the occurrence was or is
probable."
<P>

615   	At paragraph 142 their Honours said it made no difference
in principle if a past hypothetical event is in question, rather
than a future
one, or if the damages for loss of profits, rather than for lost earning
capacity, is in question.
<P>

616   	At paragraph 144 they continued:-
<P>

"So where there is controversy over the validity of a hypothetical exercise of
earning capacity, or hypothetical events necessary
for claimed lost profits,
being the hypothesis for which the plaintiff contends, to say that it is more
probable than not that something
less than that for which the plaintiff
contends would have occurred may be a way of allowing for imponderables or
chances and coming
to the degree of probability of that for which the plaintiff
contends.  In substance, that is what was done in <i>Norris v Blake (No 2)</i>,
although with further allowance for the particular prospect of greater success.
If the question is whether, on a numerical scale,
a past hypothetical event
would have been 1 or 10, by a finding that it is more probable than not that
the event would have been
6 may be meant that there was a 60% chance of its
being 10."
<P>

617   	It is my understanding that unless it can be said that
there was no chance, in the sense to which the High Court referred
in Malec, of
the hypothesis coming to eventuality, one must reflect in the award of damages,
even though one may not be satisfied
that the damages amount to that for which
the plaintiff contends, unless, of course, one is satisfied that there is a
practical certainty,
a discounting factor and the Court must, ultimately, work
out the damages as best it can from the evidence.  I do not understand
any of
this discussion to proceed on the basis that the onus does not remain on the
plaintiff to prove its damages.
<P>

618   	In this state of the law, I do not accept that unless
HJPL proves, on the balance of probabilities, that it would have opened
17
restaurants in each and every year, it has not established an entitlement to
damages.
<P>

619   	Mr Oslington then submitted that I should accept Mr
Bryant's "cash flow" approach, in preference to Mr Gower's "loss of profit"
approach, and that I should accept Mr Bryant's preferred discount rate to that
of Mr Gower's.
<P>

620   	Mr Oslington's oral submissions did not go beyond
identifying these three points as those relevant to a determination of
damages
for lost opportunity.  His submissions reflected his written submissions and,
commencing at Tp.4193, dealt with certain precise
submissions made on behalf of
HJPL.  However, it seems to me, that in the light of those submissions the
matters to which I am entitled
to have regard, as being the matters in issue,
are the three thus identified.  I have dealt with the first.  The second is the
question
as to whether the cash flow approach or the loss of profits approach
should be preferred.
<P>

621   	At Tp.3582 Mr Bryant stated his disagreement with Mr
Gower's use of profit as opposed to cash flow as the basis for discounting,
although he said he understood the inquiry was to establish the sum needed to
restore HJPL to the position it would have been in
but for the assumed breach.
Mr Bryant disagreed that what HJPL had lost was various profits, which would
have been available to it
from time to time.  He took the view that it was
"purely a loss of access to cash", and he agreed that accounting standards had,
as one of their objects, an attempt to bring about a matching between
expenditures and receipts for the purposes of ascertaining
whether a particular
venture had made a profit or loss.  He also agreed those conventions dictated
to a great extent what use a company
may make, for example by way of
distribution of profits, of moneys it had from time to time, but he disagreed
that a more accurate
methodology for determining the real loss of HJPL, in the
present circumstances, was to ascertain the profits it had lost from time
to
time, because it was in respect of them that HJPL could make unfettered
decisions as to what it wished to do with the money. 
His reason for
disagreement was stated thus:-
<P>

"Because profits, as recorded in profit and loss accounts, are an attempt to
measure profits for the purposes of, for example, reporting
to shareholders.
But, as I indicated earlier on, they include calculations assuming that cash
flow - cash that has actually been
spent on fixed assets should, for the
purposes of accounting, be treated as an expense over a number of years as
those assets are
used up.  But what has actually happened is that the company
has been deprived of cash inflows resulting - being the profits that
it was
expecting to earn from these restaurants, but before that it would have been
required - before earning those profits, it would
have been required to make
cash outflows.  When you discount a stream of figures that reflects the cash in
and out as compared with
discounting the profit and loss figures, you can get a
very different answer.  And the discounting of the profit and loss figures
is
fairly meaningless.  In fact, it is almost completely meaningless, because
discounting is all about the use of cash.  It is all
about what is the cost of
not having some cash when I expected to have it, and it is the - what Hungry
Jack's is claiming here that
it has lost is a stream of future cash inflows
which would have to have been preceded by some outflows, and only by
discounting on
that basis do you get a sensible figure to award to-day": Tp.
3583.
<P>

The discounting, to which reference was being made, was by a figure, which
would properly compensate HJPL by deriving the present
value at 31 December
1999 of lost profits that occur either prior to or subsequent to that date, not
a figure to which regard must
be had in assessing the contingences and
vicissitudes.
<P>

622   	At Tp.3585 Mr Bryant agreed that both the cash flow and
the profit and loss methods dealt with same figures to be found in
a profit and
loss account over a number of years, "so we are not talking different figures;
we are merely talking when do you reflect
something as having happened".  He
continued:-
<P>

"And the reason we are doing it is to work out what has it cost Hungry Jack's
not to have this money, or alternatively, for some
period what have they saved
through not spending money.  For example, if there would have been a cash flow
this year, my methodology
would say that you have attributed some costs to that
this year.  There would have been a cost of borrowing money or using equity
to
access it, to use that money.
<P>

My methodology says, because that is happening this year, you have to calculate
the interest in relation to this year and a whole
year's worth of it.  If you
use a profit and loss methodology, you are assuming that that cash flow didn't
happen this year, but
it would be reflected as depreciation over the next
twenty years.  So you will then be calculating interest on a sort of notional
borrowing of little amounts over twenty years when that is not what has
happened.  What has happened is a borrowing this year to
fund the capital."
<P>

623   	Mr Bryant agreed that he treated as an outgoing the
expenditure of the sum to buy an asset, which formed part of the cash
flow,
whereas Mr Gower, as Mr Bryant understood it, assumed that the expenditure
happened "in little bits over twenty years rather
than all happening at once
upfront".
<P>

624   	At Tpp.3588-3589 Mr Bryant said:-
<P>

"When we were talking about the spending of money by the investor, the
conventional profit and loss analysis would say that the
spending of that money
does not reflect in the profit and loss account that year.  It reflects on the
balance sheet but not on the
profit and loss account.  The profit and loss
account will only record that expenditure progressively over twenty years as
the asset
is used up.  That is very sensible for the purposes of reporting
whether or not a company is making a profit in accordance with accounting
standards, because what that is trying to do is to take account of the extent
to which the assets are used up during each year. 
But that is not what we are
trying to do here.  What we are trying to do here is to say what has it cost
Hungry Jack's not to have
the business that it says it has been deprived of.
In years in which there would have been cash inflows, it has been deprived of
the use of those cash inflows, before any depreciation, and in the years in
which there would have been cash outflows, it has, if
you like, had the benefit
of not suffering those outflows.  And if you don't calculate the interest on
that basis, you don't get
to a sum that properly compensates for the loss of
the use of the money or, alternatively, for the benefit of not spending the
money."
<P>

Mr Bryant agreed that that last answer indicated the prime area of disagreement
on this point between himself and Mr Gower.
<P>

625   	In his written submissions Mr Hutley, who conducted the
case for damages for HJPL, made the point that Mr Bryant's methodology
took
account of money "saved" where cash outflows had not occurred, but that he had
acknowledged that a benefit of that kind would
only have been received by HJPL,
if its shareholders had already subscribed by way of capital the amount of
money, which would have
been expended for development in the period 1995 -
2000, before August 1995.  However, in my opinion, that tends to point up the
validity of the approach taken by Mr Bryant in the sense that unless one looked
at what would actually have happened it becomes very
difficult to make any
meaningful assessment.  The underlying assumption, at this point, was that HJPL
would have had to have had
the money from some source if it had proceeded with
the development programme.
<P>

626   	There was more evidence on this matter and great debate
about it. I have come to the view that the cash flow basis is preferable
to the
loss of profits basis, when one is giving consideration to what might have
occurred but for the breach, because it takes into
account, in the view to
which I have come, the reality of the situation with which HJPL would have been
confronted; namely the necessity
to expend money from which it would have
derived benefits.  As Mr Bryant pointed out, as a matter of reporting, the
appropriate method
may well be by having regard to the profit and loss
situation.  However, in seeking to put HJPL into the position in which it would
have been but for the breach, in the particular circumstances of this case, it
seems to me that that is achieved by looking at what
HJPL would actually have
done.  That can be seen better, in my view, from the adoption of the cash flow
method, and, what is more,
it seems to me to accord better with the fact that
HJPL, as I am satisfied it would have done, was developing its business, each
restaurant forming a part of that business but, not relevantly, being used as a
separate entity for the purpose of the determination
of the overall profit and
loss of the business.  I appreciate that each individual restaurant contributed
to that but, in a business
of this type, one is dealing with restaurants, which
have been part of it for many years and more recently acquired ones. Some are
more profitable than others.  But, in the end, one is concerned with the
overall effect of their operations, which, I consider is
better addressed by
the actuality arising from the cash flow method, essentially for the reasons
put forward by Mr Bryant.
<P>

627   	The final matter concerns the discount rate, in the sense
I have explained, to be applied.  It was submitted on behalf of
HJPL that in
the Agreed Statement of Experts of 9 July 1999, Mr Gower expressed the view
that a 9 per cent discount rate was appropriate
based on a risk-free rate of
5.5 per cent.  In his report of 31 May 1999 and in the Agreed Statement of
Experts, Mr Bryant expressed
the view that a 16.5 per cent discount rate should
be applied, in reliance on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, ("CAPM"), and a
risk-free
rate of 9 per cent.  Mr Gower did not consider that the application
of the CAPM was appropriate.
<P>

628   	Mr Bryant's evidence as to the use of the CAPM
methodology was not entirely convincing.  It is summarised in paragraphs 36.38
et seq and, in the end, it appeared that but for his application of a 25 per
cent increment because HJPL was unlisted, he and Mr
Gower would have had little
difference as to the appropriate discount rate to be applied using the CAPM
methodology.  Mr Bryant also
gave some evidence as to the risk-free rate, which
was subsequently and very properly in all the circumstances, retracted to some
extent by Mr Oslington on 23 August 1999: para 36.40.  In all the circumstances
I find that I am unable to adopt Mr Bryant's approach
to the discount rate
based on the CAPM method.
<P>

629   	Subsequently, Mr Bryant expressed the view that a
discount rate of not less than 17.5 per cent should be applied as reflecting
the return of an "average restaurant" operated by HJPL in the future.  He
agreed that he had calculated this on a company-owned restaurant
opened on 1
January 2000 and, to that extent, he had departed from the assumption that
damages were to be measured from August 1995,
and he had not sought to
determine the return upon HJPL's existing business projected from August 1995
forward.  He was unable to
state whether the discount rate would have been
higher or lower if calculated as at August 1995.
<P>

630   	I have some further difficulties with Mr Bryant's
evidence in relation to this matter, which are referred to in paragraphs
36.42
et seq.  
<P>

631   	Mr Gower preferred a discount rate of 9 per cent.  This
rate was not subjected to the same criticism as Mr Bryant's preferred
discount
rates.  It is, in my opinion, the one which should be accepted.
<P>

632   	The next question is the period for which the restaurants
would have operated.  HJPL submitted that the period should be
for 40 years to
accord with BKC's practice, rather than 20 years.  It placed reliance on Mr
Fitzjohn's evidence that "in most cases"
franchisee agreements would be renewed
at the expiry of the first 20 years: Tp.2202, and on HJPL's history in the
business.  I am
of the view that the 40 year period should be adopted, but that
a higher percentage for contingencies should be applied because of
the longer
period during which might occur.  Finally, I consider that it is appropriate to
proceed on the basis that the evidence
established, which I accept, that leased
restaurants would have been utilised.
<P>

633   	On the question of the amount of damages for loss of
opportunity to open new company-owned restaurants I am of the view that
the
cash flow method with the adoption of a 9 per cent discount rate should be
applied over a period of 40 years.
<P>

634   	In calculating the loss of profit Mr Gower adopted three
alternative samples to represent the type of store which would have
been opened
in the period after August 1995.  "Sample 1" was comprised of new or
refurbished stores, located in suburban areas with
drive-throughs, external
seating, playgrounds and indoor seating, and 12 restaurants in Western
Australia, 8 in South Australia,
11 in Victoria, 6 in New South Wales/ACT and 9
in Queensland.  Mr Cowin gave evidence supporting that calculation upon which
he was
not cross-examined.  The second sample, ("Sample 2"), comprised the 33
restaurants opened by HJPL between December 1992 and May 1996
and, accordingly,
a larger sample of restaurants on which to predict the performance of those
which would have been opened from August
1995, but for BKC's withholding of
expansion approval.  The third sample, ("All Stores Sample"), comprised all the
stores, whenever
opened.  It seems to me that "Sample 1" is the appropriate one
to use, as reflecting the type of stores Mr Cowin said would be opened.
<P>

635   	I have noted Mr Oslington's attack that there was no
evidence to support any method of calculating damages in the event of
it not
being found that 17 restaurants would have been opened.  There is a response to
this in paragraph 36.27 of HJPL's written
submissions, in which it is noted
that a discount of 22.5 per cent would be applicable if no more than 11 stores
would have been
opened.   What I propose to do is to adopt a percentage for
discounting for contingencies and vicissitudes, which will have regard
to the
risk, as best I can assess it, which assessment I make based on the history of
HJPL and my estimation of the future as disclosed
by the evidence.  In making
that assessment it is appropriate to have regard to the possibility that Mr
Cowin's forecasts may prove
unduly optimistic, an assumption which in no way
derogates from my acceptance of his evidence.  It is a judgmental assessment
made
doing the best I can to evaluate the various contingencies, with the
benefit of the evidence of HJPL's history, the type of business,
its
aspirations for the future and the risks which may be encountered, particularly
having regard to the length of time involved.
 The percentage I propose to
apply is 55 per cent.  Accordingly the damages for the inability to open
company-owned stores is to
be calculated by reference to the cash flow method
based on a 9 per cent discount rate for "Sample 1" over a period of 40 years
reduced
by 55 per cent, namely, on the figure of $96,716,000 less 55 per cent,
which equals $43,522,200.
<P>

636   	The next figure to which I have regard is the loss of
opportunity by HJPL to introduce third party franchisees.  I have concluded,
for the reasons to which I have referred, that this was caused by the conduct
of BKC.  The basis on which the claim is made is set
forth in paragraphs 36.48
et seq.  BKC's attack was, firstly, that the number of restaurants for which
HJPL contended would not have
been achieved, notwithstanding that it was
founded, in part, on the uncontradicted evidence of Mr Cowin.  There seemed to
be no substantial
dispute on the figures, the claim of HJPL based on the 9 per
cent discount rate, which I accept and which was in issue, being $39,925,000.
In my opinion, the contingencies involved in this exercise are not quite as
great.  I accept that there were franchisees available,
and that HJPL would
have taken advantage of them.  In my judgment, there should be a discount of 40
per cent, reducing $39,925,000
to $23,955,000.
<P>

637   	The next claim is for $4,405,000, based on the 9 per cent
discount rate, for loss by HJPL of service royalty at "Hungry Jack's"
restaurants opened at Shell service stations.  This is the claim for equitable
compensation based on the breach of fiduciary duty,
which I have held to have
been established.  Mr Gower's evidence, at a financial level, on this aspect
was not challenged and, in
his oral submissions, Mr Oslington identified the
issues between Mr Gower and Mr Bryant as ones concerning the allowance which
ought
to be made for overheads and the discount rate.  
<P>

638   	In his initial report Mr Gower made no allowance for
overhead and used a discount rate of 9 per cent.  Mr Bryant's response
commenced at paragraph 245 of his report of 1 June 1999: part of Exhibit 9.  Mr
Bryant stated the assumptions on which Mr Gower proceeded,
including that HJPL
would have incurred no incremental overhead to provide services to these
restaurants, and noted that that approach
differed from the one taken by Mr
Gower in calculating the loss relating to third party franchisees for which he
allowed 2.5 per
cent.  Mr Bryant considered that 7 per cent, being the amount
he had applied for third party franchisees, should be allowed.  In
the Agreed
Statement of Experts, paragraph 16, Mr Gower had provided for 6 per cent out of
franchise revenues, whilst Mr Bryant had
asserted that at least 7 per cent was
required.  In my opinion, Mr Bryant has shown a consistency in approach, which
should be followed,
and, if that is done, the difference in the figures does
not justify departing from Mr Bryant's assessment of 7 per cent.
<P>

639   	In his report of 25 August 1999, part of Exhibit U, Mr
Gower recalculated the figures by providing a 2.5 per cent figure,
thus
reducing $2,892,000 to $2,819,000, the base figure being worked on a 9 per cent
discount rate.  Assuming the 9 per cent discount
rate for the moment, I
consider the figure of $2,892,000 should be reduced by 7 per cent i.e. to
$2,689,560 to which tax at 36 per
cent, i.e. $968,242, must be added thus
giving a figure of $3,657,802.
<P>

640   	So far as the discount rate is concerned, Mr Gower
maintained that the proper rate was 9 per cent.  Mr Bryant was of the
view that
16.5 per cent should be allowed on the basis that Mr Gower had failed to take
into account the correct date of the losses.
 The losses in this instance are
far more susceptible of being attributed to dates certain than those with which
I have dealt thus
far and, on that basis, it seems to me that Mr Bryant's
analysis is the more compelling, founded, as it is, on the legal proposition,
(which he assumed), that the damages flow from the date of breach after which
the Court has a discretion to award interest.  The
result, as I understand it,
is reflected in Appendix F1 to Mr Bryant's report of 1 June 1999 and produces a
figure of $2,164,897.
 In my opinion that is the basic figure which should be
applied.
<P>

641   	Mr Oslington submitted that the contingencies and the
continued enjoyment of the royalty must also be considered as the claim
was to
the year 2017 and based on a continuance at Shell sites until that time.  On
the other hand Shell, in its settlement agreement
with HJPL, has indicated a
desire to continue the restaurants.  In my opinion the figure to which I have
referred should be reduced
by 30 per cent to reflect the contingencies, i.e.
rounded to $1,515,428.
<P>

642   	The next head of damage is the alleged loss to HJPL
arising from the opening of stores in Western Australia, South Australia
and
Queensland in breach of the Development Agreement.  This is the
"cannibalisation claim".  It arises from the fact that under
clause 7.3 of the
Development Agreement, if HJPL was in compliance with the Development Schedule,
its prior approval was required
to the opening of new restaurants in those
States, and it could withhold that approval in the circumstances to which
reference has
been made.  HJPL has alleged that BKC breached the Development
Agreement by authorising Shell to open Hungry Jack's restaurants situated
at
two sites in Queensland and Westlakes in South Australia over HJPL's objection.
Mr Gower was asked to make certain assumptions
as to the extent of the
cannibalisation on nearby HJPL stores.  The assumptions referred to in
paragraphs 36.63 and 36.64 were taken
from a research study prepared by an
entity commissioned by BKC to determine the extent of cannibalisation.  There
was a deal of
evidence on this point, which, in my opinion, is adequately
summarised in Mr Hutley's written submissions.  Mr Oslington submitted,
Tp.4193, that Mr Gower's report was based solely on a number of assumptions he
made in which he did not address the criticism of
the conclusions reached by Mr
Bryant and the reasons Mr Bryant had for reaching them.  On the other hand, Mr
Bryant was cross-examined
to some effect, as was Mr Power, to show that the
assumptions on which Mr Gower proceeded, stemming as they did from the source
to
which I have referred, were not unreasonable.
<P>

643   	However, it is not correct to say that Mr Gower did not
address the criticisms proffered by Mr Bryant, his figure having
been reduced
from $3.4m to $3,088m.  I am not satisfied that there is an overlapping between
this and the previous claim.  Each is
predicated on a different basis and is
separate.
<P>

644   	The claim in this respect is for $3,088,000, which I
accept.  This claim must also be discounted. There are difficulties
in making
an assessment of the loss, notwithstanding that I am satisfied, on the balance
of probabilities, that there would have
been one.  I would reduce it by 40 per
cent to $1,852,800.
<P>

645   	HJPL is, accordingly, entitled to:-
<P>

(i)	$  43,522,200  for delay in opening company-owned restaurants.
<P>

(ii)	$  23,955,000  for loss of opportunity in introducing third party
<P>

                                         franchisees.
<P>

(iii)	$     1,515,428  for equitable compensation.
<P>

(iv)	<u>$     1,852,800</u>  for "cannibalisation" claims.    
<P>

	<u>$   70,845,428</u>
<P>

The damages are payable, prima facie, from the date of breach and interest will
have to be calculated.
<P>

646   	A claim was made for exemplary damages.  I do not
consider HJPL is entitled to such an award in respect of its claims for
breach
of contract: McGregor on Damages (16th Edition) (1997) para 442; Halsbury's
Laws of Australia (Volume 6) para 110-11060; Butler
v Fairclough &amp; Anor

Although Wilcox J left open the possibility in Flamingo Park Pty Limited v
Dolly Dolly Creation Pty Limited &amp; Ors  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2065%20ALR%20500" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986)  65 ALR 500</a> at p.526, I
consider, as I held in Wehbe &amp; Anor v Rolando Pty Limited &amp; Ors  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20NSWSC%20384" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990)
NSWSC 384</a> that the authorities were such that exemplary damages could not be
awarded.
<P>

647   	So far as the claim for equitable compensation is
concerned, and notwithstanding that I have held that the circumstances
giving
rise to it involve a gross breach of fiduciary duty, I am not satisfied that
such a claim gives rise to an award of such damages
or, if it does, that the
facts demand more than compensation for the breaches, notwithstanding their
serious nature.
<P>

The Failure By HJPL To Call Mr Montgomery
<P>

648   	Mr Oslington submitted that I should draw the inference
provided in Jones v Dunkel <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1959/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1959] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%20101%20CLR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959) 101 CLR 298</a> that Mr Montgomery could not have
said anything to assist HJPL's case, notwithstanding that he was its National
Development Manager
and, therefore, intimately involved in and associated with
development, which is at the heart of much of the present dispute.  I
have
referred in some detail to the way in which Mr Montgomery conducted himself.
It is quite obvious that the proper inference is
that he would not have been,
as a matter of probability, helpful to HJPL.  Indeed, as I have said, I have no
doubt that he was actively
seeking to undermine HJPL at all relevant times.
<P>

649   	It is now well established that there is no obligation on
a party to necessarily call a witness to avoid the inference arising
from Jones
v Dunkel.
<P>

650   	In Favre v Arenales &amp; Anor  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2027%20NSWLR%20437" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 27 NSWLR 437</a>,
Mahoney JA said, at p.450, that:-
<P>

"A <i>Jones v Dunkel</i> inference may not arise if, for example, a witness has
a reason for not telling the truth or refusing to assist and the party who
may
call him is aware of this."
<P>

651   	In the present case HJPL had strong grounds for
believing, on the material before it, that Mr Montgomery may well not assist
it
and, further, the prima facie evidence is that he was in dereliction of his
duties to HJPL.
<P>

652   	In Ghazal v Government Insurance Office of New South
Wales  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2029%20NSWLR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 29 NSWLR 336</a>, Kirby P said, at p.343:-
<P>

"The rule in <i>Jones v Dunkel</i> is one of commonsense reasoning.  It
provides that an <u>unexplained</u> failure by a party to call a witness may,
in appropriate circumstances, lead to an inference that an uncalled evidence
would not
have assisted the case of the party who might be expected to call the
witness.  It is important to note that this is a facility.
 It is not an
obligation in the reasoning of the decision-maker cf <i>Cafe v Australian
Portland Cement Pty Limited</i> (1965) 83 WN <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">(Pt 1)</a> (NSW) 280 at 287 ...   The
rule has no application if the failure to call the witness is satisfactorily
explained or readily understood
... But failure by a party to call a witness
likely to be friendly to the interests of the other party has been held
sufficient to
entitle a court not to draw an adverse inference from such
failure."  (His Honour's emphasis.)
<P>

There was no "unexplained" failure in the present case.  The evidence made it
clear, in my opinion, why HJPL did not call Mr Montgomery.
 Thus the failure by
HJPL to do so was either "satisfactorily explained or readily understood".
<P>

653   	It was submitted on behalf of HJPL that there was an
obligation on BKC to call Mr Montgomery and that its failure to do so
gives
rise to a Jones v Dunkel inference in relation to his conduct and its
complicity in it: Payne v Parker  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%201%20NSWLR%20191" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] 1 NSWLR 191.</a>  I note the submission
but, for the purposes of these reasons, it is not necessary to determine that
point.  
<P>

Some Other Issues Which I Will Not Consider
<P>

654   	I have stated that I do not propose to consider the
issues of election, waiver and estoppel in relation to the contractual
counts.
Nor do I propose to consider the claims for relief against forfeiture or the
entitlement to construe the Development Agreement
by reference to earlier
agreements into which the parties had entered: Punjab National Bank v de
Boinville  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20WLR%201138" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 WLR 1138.</a>  Once again the parties have set out their
submissions on these points in great detail and, if I be wrong in the views to
which I
have come, and if in consequence of my being wrong those points become
relevant, the material necessary for their consideration by
the Court of
Appeal, if that Court is otherwise disposed to consider those issues, is
available.
<P>

The Successor Restaurants
<P>

655   	HJPL has claimed relief, including relief under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.87</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>, requiring BKC to offer it a Franchise Agreement for
each of the Burger King restaurants situated at Fulham, Strathpine, Claremont,
Ipswich, Springwood, Balga, Barrack Street, Beak House, Bunbury and Bull Creek
for an additional period of either 20 years or, alternatively,
15 years from
the expiry of the initial term of the Franchise Agreement for each of those
restaurants.  The initial term of each
of those Franchise Agreements commenced
on the date each restaurant opened for business and was to expire at midnight
on the date
preceding the 15th anniversary of that opening.  I shall refer,
perhaps repetitiously, to certain of the terms of those agreements.
 Clause 9
stated:-
<P>

"Option at end of term
<P>

Provided that Franchisee shall have substantially complied with all of the
terms and conditions of this agreement and any other
agreement between
Franchisee and Company, and shall have substantially complied with the
operating standards and criteria established
for Burger King restaurants, then
at the expiration of the term hereof, the Company will offer Franchisee the
opportunity to remain
a Franchisee hereunder for one additional period of
fifteen (15) years, provided that:-
<P>

A.	Franchisee shall agree to make such capital expenditures as may be
reasonably required to renovate and modernise the restaurant
building,
premises, signs and equipment so as to reflect the then current image of Burger
King restaurants.
<P>

B.	Franchisee must have the right to remain in possession of the premises, or
other premises acceptable to the Company for the new
term.  If Franchisee
elects (or is required) to relocate, then Franchisee shall pay Company's
reasonable expenses in relocating,
developing or evaluating the new premises.
Company shall not be required to extend its credit or resources in obtaining
financing
for premises or equipment.
<P>

C.	Franchisee shall execute a new Franchise Agreement on the form then being
used by Company in the United States, which may differ
from this Franchise
Agreement as to royalty.  The rate of royalty shall be re-negotiated at that
time taking into account the Burger
King rate of royalty then prevailing in
other countries of the world.
<P>

E.	Franchisee shall give Company written notice of its desire to exercise its
option to continue as a franchisee not less than fifteen
(15) months prior to
the expiration of the term of this agreement."
<P>

656   	The clause provides a number of difficulties of
construction.  First, the opening words predicate that at the expiration
of the
term BKC will offer HJPL "the opportunity" to remain a franchisee for one
additional period of 15 years.  In the way in which
the words appear BKC is not
obliged to make that offer until the expiration of the term.
<P>

657   	Sub-clause E contains the proviso that HJPL shall give
BKC written notice of its desire to exercise "its" option, presumably
that
being the requirement that BKC "will offer HJPL the opportunity", not less than
15 months prior to the expiration of the term.
 It is not in issue that HJPL
never gave such notice to BKC, nor that BKC took any point in that regard.
<P>

658   	Thirdly, the giving of such notice so long in advance of
the expiration of the term could create problems because, firstly,
during that
period there may be an allegation that HJPL had not "substantially complied"
with the relevant terms and conditions,
and, secondly, and perhaps more
importantly, it may not at that stage have a right to remain in possession of
the premises, or premises
acceptable to BKC for the new term.  Further, at that
stage, HJPL may not be aware, and in all probability would not be aware, of
the
form of the Franchise Agreement "then being used" by BKC in the United States,
nor of the royalty being charged.
<P>

659   	Perhaps the answer to these perceived difficulties is
that it was only necessary for the written notice "of its desire" to
be given
and the matters to which I have referred were to be sorted out in due
course.
<P>

660   	Finally, the provision in relation to the royalty is, in
my opinion, an agreement to agree, the rate of royalty not being
fixed as that
prevailing in other countries of the world, but by "taking into account" that
rate of royalty in the re-negotiations.
 BKC took no point about this.
<P>

661   	I have also flagged the submissions in relation to
proviso A. Mr Bathurst submitted that there is no need to enter into a
concluded agreement in relation to capital expenditures, but an agreement to
carry out such works as may be agreed to be, or be held
by arbitration to be,
necessary.  Mr Oslington submitted that a concluded agreement was required as
to the work to be done before
a fresh Franchise Agreement would be granted.  In
my opinion, Mr Bathurst's construction is the more preferable.  I do not think
it would be consistent with the agreement to require HJPL to do more than to
agree to carry out the work ultimately agreed or held
to be necessary, without
its being assured that the option would be exercised.
<P>

662   	HJPL's "primary submission" was that the term of these
Franchise Agreements did not expire until BKC offered it the opportunity
to
remain a franchisee for one additional period of 15 years.  In my opinion, this
submission must be rejected because the words
of the clause require the offer
to be made at the expiration of the term.  I propose to ignore, as did the
parties, the requirement
for notice referred to in proviso E. I do not think
BKC could purport to terminate the agreement until the offer had been made but,
none-the-less, that does not mean that the term has not yet expired.  The
parties remain under contractual obligations by virtue
of the failure of BKC to
make the offer.
<P>

663   	A fundamental problem confronting HJPL is said to be that
the method adopted after the term of each Franchise Agreement expired
was for
the parties to enter into agreements to extend the Franchise Agreements, which
were known as the "Extension Agreements".
 In other words the parties did not
simply rely on whatever may have flowed from the option. The real dispute, on
this issue, revolved
around whether these agreements were enforceable.  Each
Extension Agreement provided for an "Extended Expiration Date" identifying
certain dates up to which "all other terms of the Franchise Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect".  The clauses said to
cause particular
difficulty to HJPL are those providing for no further extension:-
<P>

"A.	The Franchisee acknowledges that BKC has extended the term of the Franchise
Agreement on multiple occasions that, taken together
with this sixth extension,
BKC has given the Franchisee ample and reasonable opportunity to take all steps
necessary to meet the
requirements for a renewal or successor agreement to
continue to operate at the site of the franchised restaurant.
<P>

  B.	The Franchisee hereby agrees and acknowledges that BKC is under no
obligation whatsoever to allow the franchised restaurant
to continue to operate
beyond the Extended Expiration Date and that unless BKC agrees in writing and
in its sole and absolute discretion
to further extend the Extended Expiration
Date, the franchised restaurant shall close on the Extended Expiration Date and
the Franchisee
shall comply with all post-termination obligations under the
Franchise Agreement, including a de-identification of the franchised
restaurant
as provided in Exhibit A hereto, within fourteen (14) days of the Extended
Expiration Date.
<P>

  C.	The Franchisee hereby waives and releases BKC from any and all claims that
BKC has not given the Franchisee a reasonable time
and opportunity to comply
with the requirements for obtaining a renewal or successor agreement."
<P>

664   	In an attempt to meet those provisions HJPL has submitted
that the waivers, releases and acknowledgments:-
<P>

(a)	were obtained by BKC in circumstances that it was knowingly involved in a
breach of duty by Mr Montgomery, in relation to the
successor restaurants, and
had failed to disclose that breach to HJPL so as to allow it the opportunity to
remove him from responsibility
for negotiating successor works with BKC;
<P>

(b)	were obtained by BKC in breach of clause IX of the relevant Franchise
Agreements and in breach of a duty of good faith owed
to HJPL under the
Development Agreement and under threat of closure of the successor restaurants;
and
<P>

(c)	were inconsistent with HJPL's rights under clause IX of the Franchise
Agreements, and should be set aside for mistake.
<P>

It was submitted that if the acknowledgments, waivers and releases are set
aside the position is governed by clause IX of the Franchise
Agreements.
<P>

665   	The first submission was that the waivers, releases and
acknowledgments were obtained by BKC in circumstances where it was
knowingly
involved in a breach of duty by Mr Montgomery in relation to the successor
restaurants, which breach it failed to disclose
to HJPL, thus allowing it to
proceed on the basis that its interests were protected properly by Mr
Montgomery in negotiations concerning
such restaurants when BKC knew that was
not the case.  The submission continued that but for that conduct HJPL could
and would have
received proper advice as to its rights under clause IX,
including the right to insist that it was only required to undertake works
reasonably required by BKC in respect of the successor restaurants.
<P>

666   	In paragraph 303 of his witness statement of 29 January
1998, part of Exhibit U, Mr Cowin stated:-
<P>

"Throughout the period of my dealings with Fitzjohn, Miolla, Chapman, and all
other BKC officers and employees with whom I dealt,
concerning the matters
referred to in this witness statement, none of them ever disclosed to me that
BKC had been receiving information
or advice from Montgomery concerning HJPL's
business in Australia or the matters which were in dispute between BKC and
HJPL.  If
I had ever become aware of Montgomery's secret dealings with BKC, I
would have taken steps to ensure that Montgomery no longer had
access to the
confidential information of HJPL or Competitive Foods, would have required him
to give an undertaking to have no further
communications with BKC without my
express knowledge and approval, and would have removed him from any
responsibility for any matter
in issue between BKC and HJPL."
<P>

667   	Mr Cowin was not cross-examined on this statement and,
apart from that, it is an inherently probable approach.  A question
which
arises, therefore, is whether officers of BKC should have advised Mr Cowin of
Mr Montgomery's dealings with them.  If Mr Cowin
had been told there is every
reason to suppose that he would have removed Mr Montgomery from the position of
negotiating for the
successor restaurants.
<P>

668   	The next submission was that the acknowledgments, waivers
and releases are liable to be set aside, by the rescission of the
agreements
containing them, since HJPL gave them under "a serious mistake" in
circumstances where BKC was aware that HJPL was under
that mistake and
deliberately set out to ensure that it did not become aware of its
existence.
<P>

669   	In Taylor &amp; Ors v Johnson <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20151%20CLR%20422" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 151 CLR 422</a> Mason
ACJ, Murphy and Deane JJ said:-
<P>

"The particular proposition of law which we see as appropriate and adequate for
disposing of the present appeal may be narrowly
stated.  It is that a party who
has entered into a written contract under a serious mistake about its contents
in relation to a fundamental
term will be entitled in equity to an order
rescinding the contract if the other party is aware that circumstances exist
which indicate
that the first party is entering the contract under some serious
mistake or misapprehension about either the content or subject matter
of that
term and deliberately sets out to ensure that the first party does not become
aware of the existence of his mistake or misapprehension.
 What we have said is
sufficient to demonstrate the broad basis of support which the authorities
provide for that proposition.  Moreover,
and perhaps more importantly, it is a
principle which is best calculated to do justice between the parties to a
contract in the situation
which it contemplates.  In such a situation it is
unfair that the mistaken party should be held to the written contract by the
other
party whose lack of precise knowledge of the party's actual mistake
proceeds from wilful ignorance because, knowing or having reason
to know that
there is some mistake or misapprehension, he engages deliberately in a course
of conduct which is designed to inhibit
discovery of it."
<P>

670   	In Tutt &amp; Anor v Doyle &amp; Anor  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%2010" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 10</a>,
the Court of Appeal applied the decision in Taylor v Johnson and, at p.14,
Handley JA noted that in Taylor v Johnson the majority
also endorsed "wider
principles which entitle a court of equity to grant relief for unilateral
mistake in cases not covered by this
principle", i.e. the principle stated at
pp.432-433 to which I have referred. 
<P>

671   	The test propounded in Taylor v Johnson requires findings
that there was an entry into a written contract; that that occurred
under a
serious mistake about the contents of the contract; that that serious mistake
was in relation to a fundamental term; and
that in those circumstances
rescission would be ordered if the non-mistaken party was aware that
circumstances existed which indicated
that the mistaken party was entering into
the contract under some serious mistake or misapprehension and, further,
deliberately set
out to ensure that the first party did not become aware of the
existence of the mistake or misapprehension.
<P>

672   	Mr Bathurst's submissions continued that the evidence
supported the conclusion that Mr Miolla in his dealings with Mr Cowin
knew of
HJPL's rights under clause IX "and sought to obtain the releases, waivers and
acknowledgments in the knowledge that Cowin
was not then aware of those rights,
and so as to deprive HJPL of those rights".
<P>

673   	The submission continued that Mr Power also knew of them
and remained silent so as to prevent HJPL's relying on them, thus
introducing
an element of unconscionability in allowing HJPL to proceed on the basis that
its interests were properly protected by
Mr Montgomery when BKC knew that was
not the case.
<P>

674   	The submissions continued that Mr Power and Mr Miolla
were aware of the requirements of clause IX and of the provision for
arbitration in the event of a dispute about the scope of work required pursuant
to proviso A.  Mr Miolla acknowledged that, by mid-1995,
he understood that Mr
Montgomery was the person primarily involved in day to day negotiations
concerning successor stores, and primarily
responsible for review of the scope
of work required by BKC, whilst Mr Cowin was dealing primarily with the issue
of extensions of
the Franchise Agreements.  The main disagreement between the
parties concerned the work to be done to bring successor stores up to
a
requisite standard and the timing of that work, on which matters Mr Power was
dealing with Mr Montgomery.
<P>

675   	The submissions trace the discussions in August 1995,
including Mr Montgomery's advice to BKC that it should not let up on
"successor
requirements", which was conveyed by Mr Power to Messrs Blauer, Fitzjohn,
Hothorn and Miolla on 18 August 1995.  The reasonable
inference from this
statement is that Mr Montgomery chose to neglect the right of HJPL to have
contentious issues, in relation to
the work to be done, arbitrated.  So much,
in my opinion, must have been clear to BKC.
<P>

676   	At Tp.3094 Mr Miolla agreed Mr Montgomery was dealing
with successor restaurants and was, so far as he knew, a trusted employee
of
HJPL and the senior employee entrusted with issues of vital concern to it,
including the successor restaurant issues.  He was
referred to clause IX, with
which he said he did not think he was familiar by September 1995, although he
agreed that by then the
parties were proceeding to negotiate successor
restaurant requirements in circumstances where no notice had been given under
proviso
E, a basis on which each party was content to proceed either through
ignorance or otherwise.  At Tp.3096 Mr Miolla said that he did
not recall
having looked at clause IX at that time, nor whether "I looked at this or
whether I just used our standard form of Extension
Agreement".  Shortly
thereafter he said it was evident that at least by May 1995 he had read the
Franchise Agreement and whilst he
could not recall perusing clause IX "it seems
likely" that he did.
<P>

677   	He was then cross-examined about proviso A, and he agreed
that what was required was an agreement to bring the successor
stores "to the
then current image of Burger King restaurants, whatever that then current image
was": Tp.3098, and if there was a
dispute about that there was provision for
arbitration.
<P>

678   	At Tp.3099 Mr Miolla said:-
<P>

"Q. You, of course, throughout the period 1995 and 1996 adopted the stance,
firstly, that the work which had to be carried out was
work nominated by Burger
King in its sole discretion.   Do you agree?
<P>

A. I think in general that's correct, yes.
<P>

Q. You also adopted the position of Hungry Jack's had no right to the grant of
a new franchise unless and until it had completed
the work mandated by Burger
King; do you agree with that? 
<P>

A. Yes.
<P>

Q. Mr Cowin, as you understood it, disputed Burger King's right to mandate the
work in its sole discretion?
<P>

A. I don't recall.  I recall that he felt the work was too expensive, and I
recall him saying that he believed it should be a joint
- that it somehow
should be a joint effort, but that is all I recall right now off the top of my
head.
<P>

Q. Mr Cowin, as far as you were aware, relied on Mr Montgomery to advise him on
the successor store issue; correct?
<P>

A. I would say I had that general impression, yes.
<P>

Q. And apart from dealing with Mr Kemp on one instance regarding the scope of
release, it was Mr Montgomery who appeared to you
to be advising Hungry Jack's
on this particular issue?
<P>

A. My impression at the time was that Mr Cowin was making the decisions but
that he was getting input, and - he was getting input
and probably advice from
Mr Montgomery.
<P>

Q. And it was probably important, as you perceived it, that any advice Mr Cowin
got, whether from Mr Montgomery or anyone else,
was fair, impartial and given
with reference to Hungry Jack's interests rather than Burger King's
interests?
<P>

A. I don't recall ever thinking about that, given, you know, the way this
unfolded, which is that we gave one extension after another.
 I don't recall
thinking about that at all."
<P>

679   	It was put to Mr Miolla that Mr Montgomery was plainly
acting against HJPL's interests on the successor store issue with
which he said
he did not think he could agree.
<P>

680   	At Tp.3171 Mr Miolla said that he did not think that in
drafting clauses 3 and 4 of the Extension Agreements he was consciously
seeking
to take from HJPL its rights in relation to successor stores, which he knew it
had.
<P>

681   	At Tp.3083 Mr Miolla said that by September 1995 he was
aware that Mr Montgomery was representing HJPL in relation to the
successor
restaurant issues that were arising, and that it seemed likely that he
perceived, when he saw the facsimile transmission
from Mr Montgomery of 5
September 1995 that by Mr Montgomery's urging BKC to review matters such as
successor restaurants, he may
well have been putting himself in a position
where he had a fairly serious conflict of interest.  It was put to Mr Miolla
that it
was wrong of him to use material emanating from a person who had such a
conflict of interest.  Mr Miolla said he did not recall whether
he thought
about that, nor did he mean to imply from that answer that the information was
used.  However, at Tp.3103, Mr Miolla agreed
that shortly after he wrote to Mr
Cowin concerning the successor restaurant issue, and asking whether Mr
Montgomery would be responsible
for that so far as HJPL was concerned.  He
agreed that he did that in circumstances where he knew that Mr Montgomery may
be in conflict
in dealing with the successor restaurant issues, although he
qualified that by saying he did not mean to imply that he thought about
it at
the time, "but you have walked me through that and so my answer is yes".  He
said, Tp.3104, that it did not occur to him to
tell Mr Cowin that Mr Montgomery
might be acting in a way inimical to HJPL's interests.  That was an
extraordinary approach by a
trained lawyer in all the circumstances.  He was
prepared to deal with Mr Montgomery, who, to his perception, was acting in
conflict
of interests, on this contentious point without disclosing the problem
to Mr Cowin.  He was doing that in circumstances where he
knew, I am satisfied,
that he was acting contrary to HJPL's contractual rights in relation to the
successor restaurants, and dealing
with Mr Montgomery who was actively trying
to assist BKC.
<P>

682   	The evidence established that it was apparent to Mr
Miolla thereafter that in relation to the successor restaurant matters
at least
Mr Montgomery had a conflict of interest.  In all these circumstances, I do not
accept Mr Miolla's evidence that the significance
of these matters did not
occur to him at the time, and that it did not occur to him that Mr Montgomery
was acting in a way completely
opposed to HJPL's interests.  I reject his
evidence in these respects.
<P>

683   	The submissions traced through the further dealings,
particularly with Mr Cowin, and, on 4 March 1996, Mr Miolla advised
him that
BKC was unwilling to modify its contractual rights regarding its authority to
refuse to renew agreements unless HJPL made
capital agreements acceptable to it
"in its sole discretion".  The acceptance by Mr Cowin of this position must
have made it clear
to Mr Miolla that Mr Cowin was mistaken as to HJPL's
contractual rights.  Mr Miolla also acknowledged that it was unlikely, in those
circumstances, that Mr Montgomery would advise Mr Cowin to verify whether BKC
had the right to nominate works at the successor restaurants
in its sole
discretion.  In my opinion, Mr Miolla understood that Mr Cowin was acting under
a mistake of which Mr Montgomery would
not disabuse him.
<P>

684   	Mr Bathurst submitted that in these circumstances BKC was
a party knowingly involved in Mr Montgomery's breach of duty to
HJPL, so that
it could not argue that disclosure of those matters to HJPL would not have
altered its position in relation to the
successor restaurants: Brickenden v
London Loan &amp; Savings Co and Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Smith <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1991/375.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] FCA 375</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20102%20ALR%20453" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991)
102 ALR 453.</a>  The submission was that Mr Montgomery owed a fiduciary duty to
HJPL and that, in relation to the successor restaurants, he breached
that duty
to the knowledge of officers of BKC, but that those officers failed to disclose
that breach of duty to HJPL.
<P>

685   	The matter can, in my opinion, be expressed thus.  Mr
Montgomery was the National Development Manager for HJPL and the person
primarily responsible for negotiating in relation to the successor restaurants.
These matters, together with his being a trusted
employee of HJPL, were known
to BKC.  BKC, whilst negotiating for the extension agreements, appreciated that
in relation to these
matters Mr Montgomery had a highly relevant conflict of
interest, viz that he was propounding action inimical to the best interests
of
HJPL and favourable to the best interests of BKC.  In these circumstances, Mr
Montgomery could not have been acting with HJPL's
authority. BKC, no doubt for
its own commercial reasons, continued to receive and, in my opinion, make use
of information supplied
by Mr Montgomery for its own commercial advantages and,
more importantly, it failed to advise Mr Cowin of Mr Montgomery's activities.
The evidence was that if Mr Cowin had been aware of such activities he would
have removed Mr Montgomery from a position of responsibility
and, in my
opinion, there can be little doubt that Mr Cowin would have taken the steps Mr
Bathurst suggested to seek to protect the
interests of HJPL.
<P>

686   	The activities of Mr Montgomery were both in breach of
his fiduciary duties to HJPL, as I am satisfied BKC well knew, and,
because
they were not authorised, they were not the actions of HJPL.  BKC, in my
opinion, acted dishonestly or with lack of probity
in failing to advise Mr
Cowin of Mr Montgomery's activities and in accepting Mr Montgomery's actions
such as to be affected by his
breach of fiduciary duties. BKC also breached the
implied terms of reasonableness and good faith in the Franchise Agreements by
failing
to draw HJPL's attention to Mr Montgomery's conduct. Further, I am
prepared to infer, as Mr Montgomery's acts were not those of HJPL,
HJPL was,
consistently with the principles to which I have referred, acting under a
mistake of which mistake, I have no doubt, BKC
was aware and prepared to take
advantage.  Thus two relevant principles, viz "accessory liability" for breach
of fiduciary duty and
mistake, in the sense I have described, came into
play.
<P>

687   	In my opinion, to allow BKC to take any benefit from its
failure to advise Mr Cowin of these matters would be to allow it
to benefit
from its own wrong-doing, that wrong-doing being its complicity in the breach
by Mr Montgomery of his fiduciary duties
to HJPL.  There was the necessary
element of dishonesty or lack of probity on the part of BKC to give rise to
"the accessory liability"
of BKC in accordance with the principles enunciated
in Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1995/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] UKPC 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 2 AC 378.</a>
<P>

688   	In Smith the Full Court of the Federal Court adopted the
following passage from the opinion of Lord Thankerton in Brickenden
at
p.469:-
<P>

"When a party, holding a fiduciary relationship, commits a breach of his duty
by non-disclosure of material facts, which his constituent
is entitled to know
in connection with the transaction, he cannot be heard to maintain that
disclosure would not have altered the
decision to proceed with the transaction,
because the constituent's action would be solely determined by some other
factor, such
as the valuation by another of the property proposed to be
mortgaged.  Once the court has determined that the non-disclosed facts
were
material, speculation as to what course the constituent would have taken is not
relevant."
<P>

689   	In my opinion, there can be no relevant distinction
between that disclosure and the type of disclosure required by BKC as
it had
knowledge of Mr Montgomery's breach of his fiduciary duty to HJPL, which went
to the very point in issue.  Nor can there be
any doubt that the non-disclosed
facts were material.  Obviously, it was material for HJPL to know that Mr
Montgomery was dealing
with BKC in a manner potentially detrimental to HJPL's
interests and in breach of his fiduciary duties to HJPL.  
<P>

690   	Additionally, for the reasons to which I have referred, I
am satisfied that HJPL is entitled to the same, or essentially
the same, relief
based on its mistake.
<P>

691   	In considering the relief to which HJPL is entitled for
the "accessory liability" there are several alternatives.  One is
compensation.
However, it seems to me that the relief being equitable in nature, the Court
can mould it to accommodate the particular
circumstances of the case.  In those
circumstances I consider that the appropriate relief is to rescind the
Extension Agreements
and, accordingly, to leave the parties to their rights
under the various Franchise Agreements.  There is no doubt that rescission
is
available based on mistake.
<P>

692   	Mr Bathurst also submitted that HJPL was entitled to
relief pursuant to s.51AA of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> conformably with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.87</a>
thereof.  In view of the conclusion to which I have come on his first
submission, I do not find it necessary to examine that submission.
<P>

693   	The answer by BKC is contained, essentially, in paragraph
157 of its written submissions.  It was stated:-
<P>

"The defence must be rejected because continually throughout the period of the
1995/1996 successor restaurants, Mr Miolla was asserting
that HJPL had to reach
arrangements with it on a timely basis or Franchise Agreements would not be
renewed.  He was not acting on
the basis of some previously concluded agreement
other than the terms of the Franchise Agreement, and indeed denied such an
agreement
in his letter of 29 April 1996 (TB 9002).  As he said in that letter,
such agreement as there was in 1992 related to existing unapproved
equipment.
In any event, Mr Cowin agreed to make the modifications required by BKC in
relation to the 1995 and 1996 restaurants and
it is to be concluded that this
was on the basis of the advice tendered to him by outside expert consultants
and by his own development
manager, Mr Montgomery.  Mr Montgomery was not
called to give evidence so it is to be assumed that his evidence would not have
assisted
HJPL in this regard."
<P>

694   	In my opinion this submission avoids, but not deals with,
the essential thrust of HJPL's main submission.  There can be no
basis, on the
evidence, for concluding that Mr Cowin was acting in a knowing or consenting
way, when Mr Montgomery, who was advising
him, was acting in dereliction of his
duties to HJPL to the knowledge of BKC. 
<P>

695   	In his oral submissions Mr Oslington commenced to deal
with the issue of successor restaurants at Tp.4114.  He did so on
the basis
that BKC was entitled to act as it did and considered matters of fact.  At
Tp.4118 Mr Oslington made submissions in relation
to clause IX in which he said
that upon the proper construction of proviso A there had to be an agreement
reached about the scope
of work before the expiration of the Franchise
Agreement, and that was why Extension Agreements were granted.  He continued
that
the Successor Agreements, in relation to the last three restaurants to
which he had referred, all stated that BKC would give a renewal
if HJPL
completed the scope of works by a particular date.  
<P>

696   	The parties addressed a considerable amount of evidence
and submissions to the state of the renewal work and to the provisions
of the
various Extension Agreements.  In the view to which I have come BKC is not
entitled to rely on those Extension Agreements
and, subject to the moulding of
appropriate orders, HJPL is entitled to a renewal in respect of the successor
restaurants conformably
with the Franchise Agreements.  The parties did not
address on the precise form of relief and this will be a matter to which
attention
will have to be given in due course.
<P>

Notices Of Default Of The Franchise Agreements For Hexham And Maitland
<P>

697   	On 1 October 1997 BKC served notices under the Hexham and
Maitland Franchise Agreements, notifying HJPL that it was allegedly
in default
under each such agreement by selling "Oak" products at those restaurants, and
requiring HJPL to cure that default within
five days of receipt of the notices.
Each notice stated that BKC would be entitled to terminate each of those
agreements if the alleged
default was not cured within the times specified.  No
Notice of Termination has been given.
<P>

698   	The Hexham Franchise Agreement was executed in September
1993, when Mr Cowin informed Mr Wong of BKC of Oak's requirement
that HJPL
continue to sell "Oak" dairy products at those premises.  BKC and HJPL entered
into an agreement entitled "Oak Product
Test Agreement", which permitted HJPL
to sell specified "Oak" products at that restaurant from 24 September 1993 to
24 February 1994.

<P>

699   	On 22 August 1994, HJPL submitted a Site Package for a
proposed restaurant at Maitland, which included plans for an Oak milk
bar to
sell products of the same type as were sold at the Hexham restaurant.  BKC
approved that Site Package and, on 22 November
1994, HJPL requested BKC to
extend the Oak Product Test Agreement to the Maitland restaurant.  On 2
December 1994 BKC and HJPL entered
into the Franchise Agreement in respect of
the Maitland restaurant.
<P>

700   	In January 1996 HJPL requested BKC, pursuant to clause
10.5 of the Development Agreement, to approve the sale of "Oak" products.
 The
clause provided:-
<P>

"Hungry Jack's may introduce into Burger King restaurants non-BKC menu items
provided that:-
<P>

(a)	Hungry Jack's notifies BKC in advance of the proposal, in sufficient detail
to enable BKC to appreciate the nature of the proposed
item and the likely
impact of its introduction upon BKC's brand image;
<P>

(b)	BKC does not object within 30 days of Hungry Jack's notification.  The only
ground upon which BKC may object is that, in BKC's
opinion, the proposed item
would be incompatible with or detrimental to BKC's brand image; and
<P>

(c)	at no time shall the number of non-BKC menu items available in any Burger
King Restaurant exceed twenty per cent (20%) of all
items there available."
<P>

701   	BKC did not notify any objection to or disapproval of
"Oak" products within 30 days on any ground.  Since the opening of
each of
these restaurants, HJPL has sold "Oak" products at them and has paid royalties
to BKC in respect, inter alia, of those sales.
 Both restaurants have been
visited by members of BKC staff, and the sale of "Oak"
<P>

products has been observed.
<P>

702   	It was submitted on behalf of HJPL that, pursuant to
clause 10.5, HJPL is entitled to sell "Oak" products at those restaurants.
<P>

703   	BKC submitted, correctly, that it has not sought to
terminate those Franchise Agreements and that, based on its submissions
concerning relief against forfeiture, the interest HJPL is seeking to protect
"is a mere contractual interest and not a possessory
or proprietary interest".
It was further submitted that the issue concerning those restaurants will only
arise "if BKC seeks to terminate
the Franchise Agreement (which it has not
done)".
<P>

704   	The submissions continued that there is no evidence from
HJPL to establish that the sale of "Oak" products at the Maitland
restaurant
has been approved, and that clause 3E of that Franchise Agreement provides that
no items, which are not set forth in the
MOD Manual or otherwise authorised and
approved by BKC in writing will be served.  It was submitted there is no
evidence that BKC
has approved the sale of "Oak" products in writing and that,
therefore, there is no basis for the claim that approval has been given
in
respect of that restaurant.
<P>

705   	It seems to me that the memorandum from Mr Bruce McDonald
to Mr Power was a sufficient request for approval to sell the "Oak"
products,
such that the failure to object to that course, which was totally
understandable in view of all that had transpired, was
sufficient, pursuant to
clause 10.5 of the Development Agreement, to entitle HJPL to continue with that
sale.
<P>

706   	It may not be appropriate, as a matter of discretion, to
grant declaratory relief notwithstanding my view that the notices
purporting to
terminate those two Franchise Agreements were not valid.  However, if
necessary, I will hear submissions on this point.
<P>

Lack Of Good Faith
<P>

707   	HJPL submitted that BKC's actions were motivated by a
lack of good faith.  I am satisfied that in consequence of Mr Fitzjohn's
memorandum of December 1993, BKC set about seeking to win back as much of the
Australian market as it could.  A major impediment
was HJPL and the contractual
rights it had, particularly under the Development Agreement.
<P>

708   	I am also satisfied that BKC saw that it had a very real
opportunity of advancing its position by an alliance with Shell,
and I have
described the circumstances in which, in my opinion, BKC came under a fiduciary
duty to HJPL in relation to Shell, which
it breached.  In these dealings
officers of BKC acted in the discreditable manner to which I have referred.
<P>

709   	BKC also sought to impede HJPL's activities by placing
severe difficulties in its path in relation to the further recruitment
of
further third party franchisees, by withholding financial approval and
withdrawing operational approval.  None of these actions,
I am satisfied, was
justified.  In my opinion, the totality of the evidence leads to the
conclusion, to which I have referred in
dealing with each matter, that they
were motivated by the desire to ensure that HJPL could not develop, in the hope
that the Development
Agreement could be terminated.  This was, of course, an
ulterior purpose and not one justified by the contractual arrangements.
<P>

710   	Finally, officers of BKC were prepared to deal with Mr
Montgomery in the circumstances to which I have referred and with
the
consequences I have found.  This conduct was ample evidence of lack of good
faith.
<P>

711   	In my opinion, when all these matters, together with my
stated assessments of the various witnesses, are taken into account,
the
overwhelming inference is that BKC did not act with good faith.  The
submissions that its delay in taking various steps points
against this
conclusion should not be accepted.  It was determined to create a situation
which would enable it to terminate.  That,
of necessity, took time,
particularly as it wished to deny HJPL the opportunity to cure the breaches.
<P>

Conclusions
<P>

712   	The conclusions to which I have come on the matters I
have decided are:-
<P>

(a)	The two Notices of 18 November 1996 and the one Notice of 8 September 1997
did not validly terminate the Development Agreement
and, accordingly, are of no
effect.
<P>

(b)	The conduct of BKC in its dealings with Shell constituted breaches by it of
its fiduciary duty to HJPL for which HJPL is entitled
to recover equitable
compensation in the sum of $1,515,428.
<P>

(c)	The conduct of BKC in purporting to terminate the Development Agreement,
placing a freeze on the ability of HJPL to recruit
third party franchisees,
withholding financial approval to development under the Development Agreement,
and refusing operational
approval under the Development Agreement, amounted to
breaches by BKC of its contractual obligations for which breaches HJPL is
entitled
to damages in the following amounts:-
<P>

(i)	$ 43,522,200 for delay in opening company-owned 
<P>

                        restaurants.
<P>

	(ii)	$ 23,955,000 for loss of opportunity in introducing third
<P>

		party franchisees.
<P>

	(iii)	$ 1,852,800 for "cannibalisation" claims.
<P>

(d)	HJPL is entitled to rely upon the terms of the Franchise Agreements for the
successor restaurants in relation to the renewal
of those Agreements for a
further period of 15 years from the date of renewal, and BKC is not entitled to
rely on the various Extension
Agreements as in any way defining the rights in
relation  to the options contained in the Franchise Agreements.
<P>

(e)	In so far as it is appropriate to determine this point BKC is not entitled
to rely on the Notices of Default under the Franchise
Agreements for the Hexham
and Maitland restaurants.
<P>

(f)	BKC is not entitled, in all the circumstances, to rely upon the closure by
HJPL of the restaurants at Mount Gravatt in the State
of Queensland and Marion
in the State of South Australia.
<P>

(g)	It does not seem to me that on these findings BKC is entitled to any relief
on its Cross-Claim.
<P>

(h)	It will be necessary for me to hear submissions on the questions of
interest and costs.  My prima facie view is that HJPL has
obtained such measure
of success in these proceedings as to be entitled to an order that BKC pay its
costs of the proceedings.
<P>

(i)	I shall consider, in due course, what, if any, relief should be granted
against BKAL.
<P>

I invite the parties to bring in Short Minutes of Order to reflect these
conclusions.
<P>

713   	I stand the matter over for mention to Friday,  12
November 1999.
