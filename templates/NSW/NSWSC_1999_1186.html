<b>JUDGMENT (Admissibility of evidence - reputation - specific acts -
T2810)</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  The present witness, Mr Pickering, a former
member of the Legislative Council, who enjoyed high office in Government
in
this State, is giving evidence for the plaintiff.  I will categorise his
evidence in general terms as that of a reputation witness.
<P>

2   	Objection has been taken to evidence of the witness in the
area of his knowledge of the plaintiff's reputation in the gay community.
 That
is a very general description of the area.  The objection arises and is to be
understood in this context:  the witness has
not been questioned along the
usual lines that lay the foundation for testimony that the plaintiff has a good
reputation in the gay
community.  The witness has thus far given no evidence as
to the sectors or the circles, his connection with them, his knowledge
of the
plaintiff within those circles thus leading to the usual question:  what do you
say as to the plaintiff's reputation at the
relevant time in those circles?
<P>

3   	As I understand it, the evidence sought to be led is to the
following effect:  that in 1994 the New South Wales Parliament
passed anti
vilification legislation.  That legislation had been the subject of debate in
the Parliament.  It was passed in the Upper
House by reason of this witness
crossing the floor.  On the day that happened there was in Macquarie Street a
gathering of persons
for present purposes assumed to be supporters of the
legislation and no doubt including a substantial number of members of the gay
community.
<P>

4   	Upon the legislation being passed speeches were made to the
gathering by certain people:  by the witness Mr Pickering, who
received
applause and acclamation from the crowd, and by the plaintiff who, for present
purposes, I gather, received applause and
acclamation from the assembled
gathering.
<P>

5   	It is the witness' observation of that conduct of the crowd
towards the plaintiff on that occasion in relation to the passing
of that
legislation that is to be relied upon as indicating to the witness the
plaintiff's good reputation in the gay community.
<P>

6   	Prior to reaching the point where the contentious line of
questioning commenced leading to the objection, Mr Pickering had
given evidence
of personal representations made by the plaintiff to him in his ministerial
capacity.  That is,  evidence of direct
contact between the witness and the
plaintiff.  I mention this because it provides another discrete ground for
objecting to the evidence
insofar as evidence of a direct contact between the
witness and the plaintiff is insufficient to establish the sector or
circles.
<P>

7   	Evidence of good reputation, of course, is given by persons
of whom it can be said that they are in a position so to do by
reason of their
acquaintance with the circles or sectors in which the plaintiff has moved and
in which he has what is known as a
settled reputation.
<P>

8   	The evidence of good reputation is provided by the response
to the question in the usual form:  what do you say as to the plaintiff's
reputation in the circles in which you moved at the relevant time and the
answer, for example, as has been given by some witnesses
to date,
"<i>excellent"</i>.  It is the answer of that nature to that question that
constitutes the evidence of good reputation.
<P>

9   	A line of authority was referred to which I can but
summarise at this stage commencing with for present purposes <b><i>Scott v
Samson</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1882%5d%208%20QBD%20491" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1882] 8 QBD 491</a>; <b><i>Plato Films v Speidel </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%20AC%201090" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) AC

Newspapers </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20735" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 735</a> and the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Chappell
v Mirror Newspapers Limited </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20Aust%20Torts%20Reports%2080%2c691" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) Aust Torts R 80,691.</a>
<P>

10   	The cases establish the fundamental propositions:  (1)
that the plaintiff is entitled to lead evidence of good reputation;
(2) that
the good reputation of which the plaintiff is entitled to lead evidence is a
settled reputation; (3) evidence of good reputation
is evidence that the person
enjoys a good settled reputation in the relevant sectors; (4) in chief, the
plaintiff's witness is not
permitted to (and indeed, given the issue there is
no reason to develop the proposition that the plaintiff enjoys a good settled
reputation in relevant sectors) to give evidence of specific acts or facts
which may be illustrative of matters that in the end have
gone to the
establishment of that settled reputation. 
<P>

11   	In <b><i>Speidel </i></b>in the House of Lords Denning LJ
at 1139 said "...<i> the witness cannot be asked questions in
examination-in-chief about particular facts so as to illustrate the plaintiff's
good behaviour
on particular occasions</i>".  The type of evidence that that
principle would exclude would be for a witness to say that the plaintiff enjoys
a good reputation
in a particular sector because on such and such an occasion
he did such and such a thing.
<P>

12   	It is argued for the plaintiff that the evidence proposed
to be led from Mr Pickering is not evidence of a particular fact
illustrative
of the plaintiff's "<i>good behaviour"</i>, to use the words of Denning LJ.
Rather, it is evidence of the conduct of others vis-a-vis the plaintiff
evidencing his standing
among those others.
<P>

13   	For the defendant, it is submitted that the evidence of
the conduct of others vis-a-vis the plaintiff, in the circumstances
which have
been outlined, is explicable only by reference to something the plaintiff has
done; it being understood, for the purposes
of the argument, that that which
the plaintiff had done was to champion the cause ultimately reflected in the
enactment of the anti-vilification
legislation.  That appears to me to be
correct.  The evidence would show in the end, because that could only be its
logical import,
that the plaintiff had done something in connection with the
legislation, championing it, promoting it, which, upon its being enacted,
brought it about that he received the acclamation of the gathered crowd.  That
to me is cognate with evidence to the effect that
the plaintiff has a good
reputation in the gay community because he championed anti-vilification
legislation which would be evidence
of a particular act or fact illustrative of
the course of behaviour which underlay the evolution of the settled reputation.
It is
the settled reputation, as it has evolved, that is the subject of
relevant and admissible testimony in chief.  It is that reputation
for the
vindication of which the defamation action is used as the mechanism.  Of course
when a person does give evidence as to the
plaintiff having a good reputation
at the relevant time in the particular area, that person can be cross-examined,
at the cross-examiner's
peril, as to the basis for the witness's assertion that
the reputation was good.  A response by the witness that might outline the
type
of event to which the proposed testimony goes would be relevant and admissible
in cross-examination.
<P>

14   	I am not persuaded that the exclusion principle relating
to particular acts or facts is limited to evidence directly as to
what a
plaintiff had done, as opposed to evidence of what others do, the more so when,
as I am persuaded in this case, the evidence
as to the conduct of the others is
explicable only in terms of a specific act or fact involving the plaintiff.
<P>

15   	Mr Pickering (I do not know at the moment), may well
otherwise be able to give evidence in the usual way that the plaintiff
enjoyed
a good reputation in the gay community.  If that is so, then the evidence will
be led in the usual way, presumably based
on the usual groundwork having been
laid which, to the extent that there is only evidence as to representations
having been made
by Mr Marsden  to Mr Pickering, has not.  For the reasons I
have stated I propose to disallow that line of questions.
<P>
