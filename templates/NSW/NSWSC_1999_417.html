<u>10080 of 1996	COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA v ANDREW SCOTT TERREY AND
ORS</u>
<P>

<u>JUDGMENT</u>
<P>

1	These proceedings were commenced by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (the
Bank) against Andrew Scott Terrey, his mother (Kathleen
Patricia Terrey), his
wife (Lisa Reid) and Richard John McLean.  The first three defendants were the
registered proprietors of a
property known as 9 Wyomee Avenue West Pymble.
They had given a mortgage dated 31 May 1991 to the Bank for the purposes of
securing
financial accommodation advanced to McLean Terrey and Associates Pty
Ltd (the Company).  The first and fourth defendants had been
directors of the
Company.  The Company had ceased trading in August 1992 and its affairs had
been placed in the hands of some accountants.
 Some of the outstanding debts
had been met by realisation of the Company assets.  Some of the debts had been
paid by the first defendant
himself.  There remained outstanding creditors
(including the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation).  The Deputy Commissioner was
threatening
to liquidate the Company.  This situation led to the execution of a
Deed made between the first and fourth defendants (the Deed).
 It was made on
25 June 1993.  A copy of it is Exhibit 2.
<P>

2	The claim brought by the Bank was founded on default under the mortgage and
certain guarantees.  Default was not in issue.  A
demand had been made on about
3 February 1994.  This demand led to the first defendant commencing proceedings
against the fourth
defendant in the District Court.  A copy of the District
Court pleadings comprise Exhibit 1.  There is a Statement of Liquidated
Claim
issued on 21 February 1994.  There is a Notice of Grounds of Defence filed on
26 May 1995.  There is a Notice of Cross-claim
filed on the same date.  There
was lack of prosecution of both the Claim and the Cross-claim which resulted in
the proceedings being
disposed of pursuant to Part 12 rule 4C of the District
Court Rules.
<P>

3	Two Cross-claims were brought in these proceedings.  The first of the two
Cross-claims has no present significance.  The Second
Cross-claim was brought
by the first defendant against the fourth defendant.  It is the matter which is
now being litigated before
the Court.
<P>

4	Following the failure of the Company, there was a falling out between the
first and fourth defendants.  The first defendant ran
his own business.  The
fourth defendant had a Private Investigator's Licence (previously he had been
in the Police Force for many
years).  The claim made by the Bank against the
fourth defendant was settled.  It appears that this took place in about
1997.
<P>

5	In the proceedings against the first, second and third defendants, the Bank
was seeking both a judgment for possession and a judgment
in a monetary sum.
As a matter of fact, the first defendant has taken the position of assuming the
liability for the three defendants
(as a matter of law there was joint and
several liability).  At the time of the making of the initial demand, the first
defendant
was not in a position to pay the moneys then owing.  Further, he took
the stance that because of the contractual relationships existing
between
himself and the fourth defendant the fourth defendant had the responsibility
for paying principal and interest falling due
under the mortgage.  At an early
stage in the proceedings, the first defendant made an offer of $50,000.00 in
settlement of the proceedings.
 This offer was rejected by the Bank.  In 1997,
he made an offer in the sum of $75,000.00.  This offer was ignored by the Bank.
The
proceedings were fixed for hearing to take place on 1 and 2 March 1999.
The sum then due and payable under the mortgage was $107,451.21
(there was also
the potential liability for  the Bank's legal costs and disbursements).  The
first defendant made a further offer
of $75,000.00.  This offer was accepted by
the Bank.  The first defendant effected compliance with the Terms of Settlement
by the
payment of the sum of $75,000.00 from borrowed funds.
<P>

6	Although the proceedings brought by the Bank have been settled, the Second
Cross-claim still remained for determination.  As the
fourth defendant was then
inter alia unrepresented, the Second Cross-claim was stood over on his
application for hearing at a later
date.  Thereafter, it was further fixed for
hearing to take place on 28 April 1999.  On that day, the fourth defendant was
represented
by counsel.  Counsel had only recently received instructions in the
matter.  When the matter came on for hearing, it was in a state
of some
disarray.  Ultimately, it was stood over to 29 April 1999.
<P>

7	This adjournment allowed amendment of pleadings, the furnishing of
particulars, the preparation of further affidavits and it gave
counsel for the
fourth defendant further opportunity to prepare his client's case.  The hearing
took place on 29 April 1999.
<P>

8	The first defendant proceeded on the Amended Second Cross-claim filed in
Court on 29 April 1999.  The fourth defendant proceeded
on the Defence which
was also filed in Court on that day.  The first defendant relied on three
affidavits.  One was sworn by the
first defendant himself.  Two were sworn by
his solicitor (Mr D'Angelo).  The fourth defendant relied on an affidavit which
he had
sworn on 28 April 1999.  He tendered two exhibits.  Both parties were
cross-examined.  The oral evidence of the first defendant included
material
given by way of reply to the affidavit sworn by the fourth defendant.
<P>

9	The first defendant claims indemnity under the Deed.  It contains inter alia
the following provisions:-
<P>

	"1.  McLean agrees to assume responsibility for the paying of the principal
and interest in respect of the mortgage secured over
the premises owned by
Terrey, Lisa Reid and Kathleen Terrey (hereinafter referred to as `the Owners')
in the sum of Fifty Two Thousand
Dollars ($52,000.00) for and on behalf of
McLean Terrey &amp; Associates Pty Limited such premises being situate at 9
Wyomee Avenue
West Pymble and will indemnify the Owners from and against all
suits, claims actions and demands which may be made by the mortgagee
against
the Owners.
<P>

	
<P>

	2.   ......
<P>

	3.   ......
<P>

	4.   McLean shall indemnify and keep indemnified Terrey against any suits,
actions, claims, demands and debts which shall arise
out of the company debts
as and when they fall due, such indemnity applying to the proportion which
Terrey has paid as being his
share of the debt."
<P>

10	The Defence raises a number of matters.  Not all of them were argued.  It
suffices to refer to the principal matters argued in
general terms.  It is said
that the fourth defendant was forced to sign the Deed by the duress or undue
influence of the first defendant.
 It is said that the first defendant is
estopped from bringing the present Claim.  It is said that there was no
entitlement to indemnity
under the Deed.  It is said that there has been a
failure to mitigate loss.
<P>

11	The first and fourth defendants have given evidence that is in conflict.  I
closely observed the demeanour of both defendants
during the giving of
evidence.  In assessing credibility I have had regard to both demeanour and
evidence.
<P>

12	I accept the evidence of the first defendant.  He was an impressive witness.
I formed the impression that he did his best to
give honest and reliable
evidence.  Where there is conflict, I prefer his evidence to that given by the
fourth defendant.
<P>

13	The defence of duress or undue influence is very much dependent on the
evidence given by the fourth defendant himself.
<P>

14	In his affidavit, the fourth defendant deposed inter alia to the
following:-
<P>

	"2.  On the day the deed the subject of these proceedings was signed, Scott
Terry came to me and said words to the effect:
<P>

	The tax office has to be paid by 4 pm today.  If it is not, it will wind the
company [McLean Terry and Associates Pty Limited ACN
003 261 550] up.  I don't
care because I've got the money to repay my loan accounts to the company.  If
you don't - you have no choice
but to sign this deed.
<P>

	3.    At the time I was afraid of the stigma of going bankrupt and believed
that, If I did go bankrupt, I would lose my Private
Investigator's licence and
be unable to work.  (I have held a licence for the last 12 years).
Accordingly, I desperately wanted to
avoid bankruptcy.  The company had ceased
to trade on 21 August 1992, my car had been repossessed, the bank had taken my
house and
my de facto relationship of 10 years was breaking up under the
financial stress.  I was in an extremely emotionally stressed state.
<P>

	4.    At the time I signed the deed, I did not have an opportunity to seek
legal or financial advice and I signed because I felt
I had no choice but to
accede to his request otherwise he would stand by and watch me go bankrupt."
<P>

	During the cross-examination, this version was somewhat watered down.  The
version was in conflict with what was said by the first
defendant in
significant respects.
<P>

15	It appears that the Deed had been prepared by the solicitor for the first
defendant.  It was probably signed following some arrangement
to meet made
between the defendants.  It was signed in the foyer of premises where the
fourth defendant's office was then located.
 It was signed in circumstances
where the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation was pressing for payment and there
was a threat of the
commencement of winding-up proceedings if payment was not
made.  There was urgency.  The first defendant was concerned that some
equality
of contribution to inter alia the meeting of company liabilities was secured.
The fourth defendant had not made any contribution.
 The first defendant was
prepared to pay the tax liability so long as the fourth defendant entered into
the Deed (it was necessary
for him to borrow moneys to meet that liability).
The tax liability is the subject of clause 3 of Exhibit 2.  The fourth
defendant's
demeanour, at the time of signing, has been described as being cool
and collected.  He was a man of experience who was not labouring
under any
disability.
<P>

16	The questions of duress and undue influence were the subjects of limited
argument.  I am not satisfied that an acceptance of
the version appearing in
the fourth defendant's affidavit would make out the defence of duress or undue
influence.  In any event,
I do not accept that version in significant respects.
It may be that the fourth defendant's life was then beset with some personal
problems.  In signing the Deed, he achieved the object of staving off a forced
liquidation of the Company.  He wanted a voluntary
liquidation as opposed to a
compulsory winding up.    There is no evidence of any threat in the sense
required by the authorities
(the affidavit speaks only of a "request").  I am
not satisfied that the fourth defendant signed the Deed otherwise than of his
own
free will.  I find that the defence of duress or undue influence is not
made out.
<P>

17	The defence of estoppel looks to the decision of the High Court in <u>Port
of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Limited</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=147%20CLR%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">147 CLR 589</a> in the context of
the dismissal of the District Court proceedings.
<P>

18	Part 12 rule 4C makes provision for the dismissal of dormant actions
commenced in the District Court before 1 January 1996. 
Sub-rule (2) provides
that if in an action to which this rule applies no Praecipe for Trial has been
filed before 1 January 1998,
the action is on that date deemed to be
dismissed.
<P>

19	Rule 4C forms part of the case management system of the District Court to
give effect to its published Strategic Plan.  The objective
was to bring about
inter alia expeditious disposition of civil actions.  Actions disposed of
pursuant to the rule are deemed to be
dismissed.  The term "dismiss" is defined
in the rules (Part 1 rule 4).  Although it is defined to mean a final
disposition of the
proceedings, it is for present purposes a dismissal "without
prejudice to any right to commence fresh proceedings seeking the same,
or
substantially the same, relief".
<P>

20	Accordingly, the dismissal of the District Court proceedings in this case
does not give rise to any estoppel (issue or otherwise).
 The scope of
<u>Anshun</u> remains a matter of some debate (<u>Tanning Research Laboratories
Inc v O'Brien</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=169%20CLR%20332" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">169 CLR 332</a> at p.355).  It may be that <u>Anshun</u> is a
case of mere issue estoppel (at p.345).  It has been said that one thing that
is clear about <u>Anshun</u> is that there is much that is unclear  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=71%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20934" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">71 ALJ 934</a>
at p.942).
<P>

21	It is a creature of the inherent jurisdiction of the Court.  It may be
founded on estoppel from the bringing of an action which,
if it succeeds, will
result in a judgment which conflicts with an earlier judgment.  In <u>Macquarie
Bank Ltd v National Mutual Life Assurance of Australia Limited &amp; Ors</u>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR 543</a> at p.558 Clarke JA (with whom Priestley J agreed) observed
that the appropriate order is a stay of proceedings and that the Court
retains
a discretion not to grant a stay if special circumstances exist.
<P>

22	The Second Cross-claim appears to have been brought in about September 1996.
Thereafter, there would seem to be a case for expediency
in disposing of all
disputes in the proceedings in this Court.  There may have been a case for a
stay whilst both the Second Cross-claim
and the District Court proceedings
remained on foot.  However, the possibility of the granting of such a remedy
passed with the dismissal
of the District Court proceedings.
<P>

23	The application of <u>Anshun</u> was not fully argued.  But fortunately, it
is not necessary to further pursue its intricacies. I am not satisfied that it
has application
in the circumstances of this case.  In my view, this defence is
also not made out.
<P>

24	I am not satisfied that the mitigation arguments have any substance.  The
evidence falls well short of even making them arguable.
 No purpose is served
by dwelling on other matters raised during argument.
<P>

25	In my view, all of the defences pleaded fail.  Whilst they are reflective of
enthusiasm and imagination, I consider that each
of them is devoid of merit.
<P>

26	The evidence reveals a situation where the first defendant effected a good
settlement of the action brought by the Bank.  I am
satisfied that the present
claim for indemnity falls within the indemnity provisions of the Deed.
<P>

27	For completeness, I should mention a matter which was not traversed during
argument.  It would seem that the fourth defendant's
failure to assume
responsibility for the payment of principal and interest under the mortgage was
a breach of the provisions of the
Deed and itself actionable in damages.
<P>

28	Indemnity is sought in respect of the sum of $75,000.00 together with a sum
of $30,160.00 for costs and disbursements.  There
is also a claim for interest.
It was neither formulated nor quantified.
<P>

29	The second cross-claimant (first defendant) is entitled to judgment against
the named cross-defendant (fourth defendant) on the
Second Cross-claim.  The
amount of the judgment is yet to be quantified.  If there is no consensus as to
quantum, this question may
be the subject of further argument.  The named
cross-defendant is to pay the costs of the Second Cross-claim.  Exhibits may be
returned.
