<b>2955/99	VALDA L. MANCINI v JOHN P. MANCINI</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  This judgment relates to Mr Mancini's Notice of
Motion dated 20 July 1999.  The parties were formerly married to
each other;
their marriage has been dissolved.  They were, until 29 June 1999 the only
directors of three companies which are the
subject of claims for relief in the
plaintiff's Summons dated 1 July 1999.  Each held one of the two issued shares
in each of Wesco
Industries Pty Ltd, Wesco Quarry Products Pty Ltd and Wesco
Ready Mixed Concrete Pty Ltd.  These and several others controlled by
the same
persons, are referred to as the Wesco Group.  The plaintiff and the defendant
are the only shareholders and they are the
persons most substantially
interested in the companies' affairs.   
<P>

2  	On 29 June 1999 there were held what were or purported to be
meetings of the directors of Wesco Industries Pty Ltd, Wesco Ready
Mixed
Concrete Pty Ltd and Wesco Quarry Products Pty Ltd.   At those meetings Mrs
Mancini purportedly resolved to appoint Mr Ray
Azzopardi and to remove Mr
Mancini as a director.  The plaintiff Mrs Mancini's case is that the defendant
Mr Mancini ceased to be
a director of each of those three companies on 29 June
1999, and in her Summons she claims (Claim 1) a declaration that he was an
officer of each company until 29 June 1999 and (Claim 6) an order restraining
him from taking any steps relating to their management.
 She also makes a
number of other claims for declarations that in various ways he has failed to
act honestly, failed to exercise
care and diligence, made improper use of his
position as an officer and is in breach of fiduciary duties to the companies,
and has
claimed damages and other relief.  The Notice of Motion of 20 July 1999
claims declarations in relation to each of the three companies
that a meeting
held on 29 June 1999 was invalid and declarations that the removal of Mr
Mancini as a director on that day was invalid.
 
<P>

3  	The questions raised by these claims for declarations are basic
to affairs of the companies and the conduct of Mrs Mancini's
proceedings, and
also to the continuing business of the companies.  The continuance of business
under the control of Mrs Manacini
and Mr Ray Azzopardi is under challenge, and
there is room for confusion and loss if any lengthy period passes without
resolution.
Both parties have pending applications to join the companies as
parties: Mrs Mancini wishes to join them as plaintiffs  and Mr Mancini
wishes
to join them as cross-defendants.  Although the individuals whose interests are
affected in substance are already parties,
it is important in point of form
that the companies should be bound by any further decisions, both parties wish
to join them as parties,
and with their joinder will come difficulties of
knowing whether purported instructions to lawyers or other steps in the
proceedings
are effectual.  There is also the important question of control of
the companies' funds, including the application of funds for the
purposes of
litigation<i>.</i>
<P>

4  	The matters raised by Mr Mancini's Notice of Motion of 20 July
must be established if the court is to dispose of the claim made
by Mrs Mancini
in her Notice of Motion of 7 July 1999 for an injunction restraining Mr Mancini
from attempting to wind up the various
companies or from taking part in their
internal management; that claim appears to be based either largely or wholly on
the view that
Mr Mancini has no standing to take part in the internal
management of the companies and that there is no substance in his complaints
about his exclusion or in any supposed deadlock demonstrated by the
exclusion.
<P>

5  	The objection made by Mrs Mancini's counsel that the companies
should be parties to the Notice of Motion leads to the question
who can make
their decisions and represent them.  Unless and until someone other than Mr and
Mrs Mancini is put in a position of
control of their affairs they will be
paralysed, unable to give effectual instructions without the concurrence of
both of them, which
is very unlikely to occur, and unable to take any but a
passive part in the litigation.  Their joinder as parties to the Notice of
Motion would attain no more than formal objects.  It also would be desirable as
a matter of form that Mr Azzopardi should be a party
to the application and be
bound by the result.  However his part in the controversy is very minor.  It is
unfortunate that the form
of the application means that Mr Mancini is asking
for declaratory orders which if made will bind only Mrs Mancini and Mr Mancini,
and will not bind other persons whose interests are involved.  However those
other persons namely the companies and Mr Ray Azzopardi
are less directly
concerned in the declarations claimed than Mrs Mancini and Mr Mancini, and I
regard the possibility that they may
in the future in some way wish to debate
the subject matter of the declarations as no more than a theoretical
possibility.  
<P>

6  	The most important consideration is that Mrs Mancini chose to
give the litigation the shape it has by commencing the proceedings
herself
claiming remedies in the interest of the companies without joining them as
parties; this procedural choice of hers moulded
Mr Mancini's conduct in making
the present application at a time when the companies were not parties.  The
persons principally involved
are the only members of these two-member
companies, and they are parties to the application and will be bound by the
outcome .
<P>

7  	I was referred to observations in the judgment of the Full Court
of the Federal Court in <b>News Limited v Australian Rugby Football League
Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1996/870.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] FCA 870</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20139%20ALR%20193" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 139 ALR 193</a> at 298 and 299.  I am mindful of their Honours'
observations to the effect that a declaratory order <i>"... which directly
affects the third person's rights against all liabilities to a party should not
be made unless the person is also
joined as a party</i>" (line 23) but also of
their Honours' observations at l.45 relating to the test for a direct interest
for this purpose - "<i>The test involves matters of degree, and ultimately
judgment, having regard to the practical realities of the case, and the nature
and value of the rights and liabilities of the third party which might be
</i>directly<i> affected</i>."  In appraising the practical realities of the
case I have not thought it important that the companies are not on the record
when
their only members are, while Mr Azzopardi's interest in maintaining that
he is a director does not appear to me to be an interest
of any real value or
importance; and the lengthy dealings with the issues by the parties here leaves
me of the view that there is
no practical possibility that his position could
be upheld.
<P>

8  	All in all it is important that the questions raised by the
Notice of Motion should be determined soon after the outset of the
litigation.

<P>

9  	It was not appropriate to seek declaratory relief of this kind by
Notice of Motion, which is the usual means for making an interlocutory
application.  The nature of the declarations claimed establishes that the claim
is not interlocutory, but is a claim for declaratory
orders which will
establish the parties' rights on the subjects with which they deal.  It was a
misnomer to name the application
a Notice of Motion; the substance of the
application is that it is a cross-claim and as I indicated during argument, I
will amend
the document so as to give it that correct name<i>. </i>
<P>

10  	The business activities of the Wesco Group principally relate to
trucking operations and supply and transport of ready mixed
concrete and basic
materials.  The companies operate from premises at Toohey Road, Wetherill Park,
where there are offices, a work
shop and a yard for marshalling trucks, and
also have a concrete plant at Little Street and Victoria Street, Smithfield.
The Toohey
Road premises are at the west of Wetherill Park.  The Smithfield
plant is said to be about 7 kilometres away by road: it is to the
east near the
Cumberland Highway and was referred to by at least one witness as being in
Wetherill Park.  The map in evidence shows
it as situated in Smithfield to the
east of Wetherill Park.  
<P>

11  	There is a considerable body of evidence about the business
dealings and conflicts of the parties before the resolution of
their family
property dispute on 29 March 1999.  I do not regard it as important to
establish by detailed findings the history of
their matrimonial differences and
property disputes.  It appears that the parties separated in or about 1996 and
notwithstanding
their state of conflict continued to function as directors of
and to control the companies in the Wesco Group; both were active as
directors
and participants in company business and affairs.  Exhibit B is a copy of
Consent Orders, signed by the parties on 23 March
1999 and embodied in orders
of the Family Court of Australia on 29 March 1999, which disposed of their
matrimonial property proceedings.
 The first six clauses provide, for each of
six companies, "<i>that the applicant and respondent do all things necessary
and execute all such documents in accordance with the Corporations Law and
the
Memorandum and Articles of Association ... to ensure that its day to day
operations are maintained and its goodwill and assets
are protected and
preserved."</i>  There was also provision (cl.7) for transfer of property at 7
Oxford Street Smithfield to Mr Mancini, (cl.8) for Mrs Mancini to
pay him
$100,000 and (cl.9) for Mr Mancini to transfer property at 2 Toxteth Street
Austinmere to Mrs Mancini.  By cl.10 each party
was declared to have the sole
right, title and interest in various classes of property including "<i>any ...
other property ... at the date hereof in their possession respectively</i>."
Clause 11 is in these terms: 
<P>

<i>"11.	That upon notice in writing served upon the defaulting party stating
the nature of the default with particularity the defaulting
party is to rectify
the default within seven days of the date of the said notice.  Should the
defaulting party not rectify the default
within the specified time the
non-defaulting may rectify the default and preserve the orders stated herein by
any of the following:-</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	execute documents;</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	make payments;</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	deal with any matter in the ordinary course of business;</i>
<P>

<i>that the non-defaulting party is enabled to do such things and take such
actions as the Attorney for the defaulting party."</i>
<P>

12  	Clause 12 in the alternative authorised the Registrar of the
Family Court to execute any dealing or instrument, and there was
an acquittance
of claims under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>.
<P>

13  	Mrs Mancini alleges that a Default Notice, a copy of which is
Exhibit J, was served on Mr Mancini on 9 June 1999.  Her case
is that the
notice is a notice under cl.11 of the Consent Orders and that some steps which
she took on 29 June 1999 at the meetings
were steps within the authorisation
conferred by cl.11 on a non-defaulting party to act as attorney for a
defaulting party.  The
notice stated that Mr Mancini was required, within 7
days of the date of the notice, to rectify breaches of the consent orders, and
specified what were said to be nine defaults.  In each case the steps which he
was required to carry out to rectify the default were
specified.  What are said
to be defaults vary widely in their nature; some are simple requirements for
payments to be made but some
require complex action.  The parties put
conflicting submissions before me about whether the matters charged against Mr
Mancini as
defaults in fact were breaches of the consent orders by him, whether
he was in fact in default in any respect, and for some of them
whether the
underlying events happened at all.  Although I will not address the submissions
in detail, significant aspects were that
it was contended that when the consent
orders, which have contractual force as well as being orders of the Family
Court, are set
in the matrix of facts of the parties' relationship, their
meaning is such that they only operate on rights, obligations and events
which
come into being after the date of the consent orders when they impose
obligations to ensure that day to day operations are
maintained and goodwill
and assets are protected and preserved.  Mr Mancini's contention was to the
effect that the consent orders
do not create any obligation, as alleged in cl.1
of the Default Notice, of Mr Mancini to pay to Wesco Industries Pty Ltd a sum
of
$50,000 which he received in a transaction in 1997.
<P>

14  	The evidence of the Minutes of the meetings of the Wesco Group
held on 29 June 1999 show that each meeting was conducted at
4.30 pm, and that
the persons present were Mrs Mancini Mrs Mancini and Mr R.B. Azzopardi, who is
an employee of the Wesco Group.
 Mrs Mancini was shown twice in the list of
those present, first by her own name and second with the formula "<i>John Peter
Mancini by his attorney Valda Lynne Mancini</i>".  In each case the Minutes
record that Mrs Mancini tabled the Family Court Orders and the Default Notice
and stated that defaults
in various paragraphs of the Default Notice had not
been rectified.  (She stated different groups of defaults for each company).
Then it was resolved that Mr Azzopardi be appointed director, that Mr Mancini
be dismissed as a director and that Mr Mancini's signature
be removed from the
bank's record as a person authorised to operate the bank accounts.  The Company
Secretary was directed to notify
bankers and to file a Change of Office Holders
form with ASIC.
<P>

15  	When the meetings began the only director present was Mrs
Mancini.  The claim made on her behalf was that she was present in
two
capacities or as counsel said wearing two hats, one as herself and the other as
attorney for Mr Mancini.                    
<P>

16  	In the Cross-claim the burden lies on Mr Mancini of establishing
that this chain of events was ineffectual to bring about his
removal from
office as a director of each company.  The onus of proof of facts lies on him,
including proof of any negatives.
<P>

17  	In my view the resolutions appointing Mr Azzopardi and removing
Mr Mancini were invalid and the cross-claim should succeed
and the declaration
sought should be made.  Although several different grounds exist on each of
which alternatively Mr Mancini's
success could be based, I regard it as
appropriate to set out each ground upon which I regard Mr Mancini as entitled
to succeed,
because several hearing days and considerable expense and endeavour
were used for the hearing of the Notice of Motion and a number
of matters
debated are likely to be important for the conduct of the litigation generally.
It is as well that they be established
early. 
<P>

18  	<b>Ground 1:No Service of Default Notice on Defendant</b>.  Mrs
Mancini alleges that she served the notice of default on Mr Mancini on 9 June
1999  at the Wesco Group's office at Toohey Road
Wetherill Park at about 3.30
pm.  Her credibility was severely damaged by cross-examination.  Her demeanour
was extremely unsatisfactory
and I formed a very poor impression of her as a
witness.  It appeared to me that at times her behaviour was deliberately
disruptive;
the extent to which she answered unresponsively and argumentatively
went beyond anything which was likely to have been real expression
of
difficulties of personality or difficulties of coming to terms with the
courtroom situation and the task of giving evidence. 
I formed the view that
she was not frank but was concealing matters of which she had knowledge with
respect to participation of Mr
Alan Chapman in the conduct of her legal
business and preparation of correspondence. Many times she forced on the
cross-examiner
extraneous answers which could be thought of as in some way
adverse to Mr Mancini or favourable to herself. Cross-examination made
it clear
that her evidence was wrong about the time and manner of preparation of the
Notice of Default; it refers to an event which
was said to have happened at
Wetherill Park at 11 o'clock on 9 June whereas she says it was prepared at a
meeting with a lawyer in
Parramatta which began about 9 am and was concluded by
11 o'clock.  She made an affidavit (Exhibit Q) in earlier litigation which
contained statements directly in conflict with evidence she gave before me.  It
appeared to me that she attempted to evade dealing
in substance with facts put
to her in relation to the preparation of that affidavit.  She admitted in her
evidence some confusion
as to dates. I do not accept that she had difficulties
of recollection of the times of events and the substance of events which she
claimed to have.  I do not regard her evidence about service of the default
notice on Mr Mancini as reliable. 
<P>

19  	Mrs Mancini's evidence was corroborated by evidence of Mr Ray
Azzopardi and of two other employees of the Wesco Group Mr Valageorgiou
and Mr
Ellison.  Mr Azzopardi's evidence did not directly corroborate the delivery of
the document but would place Mr Mancini at
the companies' office, and in
possession of papers, at times in the afternoon of 9 June not altogether
inconsistent with Mrs Mancini's
evidence about when she gave the default notice
to Mr Mancini.  He also said that Mr Mancini made an observation to him which
would
seem to show that he had papers which required action within seven
working days; that is papers consistent with the Default Notice.
 In a manner,
Mr Azzopardi's evidence if accepted would provide corroboration of Mrs
Mancini's evidence.  Two junior employees gave
evidence of Mr Mancini being
present at the premises on that afternoon, and of his being observed at about
5.30 pm on the premises
with a yellow envelope in his hands.  Neither of these
witnesses gave any evidence which would identify what document he may have
had,
and neither gave any satisfactory evidence which would establish why the event
was significant or memorable; except in one case
by referring to the
circumstance that it was the last occasion Mr Mancini attended the premises; it
is clear however that 9 June
was not the last such occasion.  
<P>

20  	There were some departures in Mr Azzopardi's oral evidence from
his statements about time.  Indeed the subject of fixing the
exact time of
events was shown to be difficult for each witness who dealt with it on either
side, and this is unremarkable as none
of them had any discernible strong
reason for making careful observation of the time of any of the events that
they spoke of.  There
does seem to be some room for Mr Azzopardi who has worked
in the organisation for 14 years, and perhaps also Mr Ellison and Mr
Valageorgiou
to have been influenced towards adherence to the person who is now
in charge of the organisation.  Mr Azzopardi acknowledged that
he saw his
position as tenuous if Mr Mancini regained control.
<P>

21  	When Mr Mancini returned from Queensland about a week after 9
June he went to the Wesco premises at Toohey Road, Wetherill
Park from time to
time on business over a period of about a fortnight up to 30 June when he was
confronted with his supposed removal
as a director and was required no longer
to attend.  It was not a remarkable or a memorable event that Mr Mancini should
be on the
premises late on a business day, that he should speak to staff in a
way indicating that he was leaving or that he should have an
envelope in his
possession.  There are no circumstances which would explain why the events
which Mr Valageorgiou and Mr Ellison speak
of would be sufficiently memorable
for them recall the events, complete with the date of the events, when asked to
give their attention
to the matter late in July.  There is ample opportunity
for Mr Ellison and Mr Valageorgiou to have seen him on other occasions later
than 9 June, and to have made the brief observations which they attribute to
that day.
<P>

22  	Mr Mancini's evidence was that the Default Notice was not served
on him on 9 June (and that it was not served on him at any
other time.)
Although cross-examined severely he was unshaken in his evidence denying the
happening of any such event.  He gave evidence
of a number of circumstances and
I regard his evidence as well corroborated.  In his evidence, although earlier
in the day he was
at the offices at Toohey Road where service is alleged to
have occurred he left the premises and went to Rose Hill Race Course, which
is
about 17 kilometres away, and attended a function conducted there by Ampol
Australia Pty Ltd in conjunction with a race meeting.
 He first put the time of
attendance there between the hours of 1 pm and 6 pm, and although after
cross-examination it seems clear
that he left somewhat before 6 pm, his
evidence is altogether inconsistent with his having been at the Wesco offices
at Toohey Road
Wetherill Park at 3.30 pm or at any time in the afternoon which
could be mistaken for 3.30 pm, within two hours either way.  His
evidence about
where he was was corroborated by the evidence of Ms Skara, a witness in whom I
have confidence having regard to her
demeanour and the clarity and confidence
of her account and her adherence to the substance of her evidence under
cross-examination.
<P>

23  	Mr Mancini's evidence was also sought to be corroborated by an
extract from the record of calls made on his mobile telephone,
including one
which he says he made to Mr Ray Azzopardi at the company premises from Rose
Hill Race Course at 3.46 pm.  In the absence
of any evidence establishing the
workings of the mobile telephone system I do not regard the record of the
telephone calls as of
much corroborative value.
<P>

24  	When I consider which of these inconsistent bodies of evidence I
should accept, my finding is that Mrs Mancini's case is far
outweighed by the
evidence of Mr Mancini and of Ms Skara, and in my finding it is clearly
established that the default notice was
not served on Mr Mancini on 9 June
1999, and was not served on him at all.  This finding of itself establishes Mr
Mancini's entitlement
to the declarations claimed as there can have been no
authority to act as attorney unless the Default Notice was served.  There are
however some further grounds which I regard as clearly established.
<P>

25  	<b>Ground 2:  No notice given of directors' meeting</b>.  It is
clear from Mr Mancini's evidence and confirmed by Mrs Mancini's evidence that
no notice that there were to be directors'
meetings was given to Mr Mancini.
It would have been easy to give him notice as he attended at the offices on
most business days,
but I find that Mrs Mancini deliberately refrained from
telling Mr Mancini that there were to be directors' meetings because she
was
taking the position that she could act on his behalf as his attorney.
Plaintiff's counsel contended that notice of the meeting
of directors was
effectively given in that it was given to Mrs Mancini herself and also to Mr
Mancini through Mrs Mancini acting
as his attorney under the power of attorney.
There is no evidence whatever which could support this submission; on the
evidence she
did nothing which even in form could constitute receiving notice
of the directors' meeting on behalf of Mr Mancini as his attorney.
Mrs Mancini
gave no evidence of giving notice, or of the receipt by her of notice of the
meeting in exercise of the power of attorney;
she simply did not deal with the
subject and said that she convened the meeting, not stating when or how and not
establishing the
happening of any event which, even in ceremony, could be
thought of as the receipt of notice by an attorney for Mr Mancini.  These
points are not as sterile as they may seem, as for Mrs Mancini's case to
succeed it would have to be established that receiving notice
as attorney for
Mr Mancini was authorised by cl.11, that is to say, it was a step required for
rectification of a default; and in
my view that could not be established.  No
measure of rectification of the defaults would be brought about or contributed
to in any
way by receiving notice of the directors' meeting which Mr Mancini
was entitled to have.  On this ground the proceedings at the meeting
had no
effect and Mr Mancini is entitled to succeed.
<P>

26  	<b>Ground 3: Form of Notice of Default. </b> Mr Mancini's
counsel submitted that any notice of default must specify a default under the
agreement in the Consent Orders, that
the specification must be clear on the
face of the notice, must show how the default related to the consent orders,
and must show
what action would be taken if the notice was not complied with,
so as to enable the recipient to understand what corrective behaviour
would be
taken to cure the default.  It was submitted that the Notice of Default was
defective in that it did not warn Mr Mancini
of the action that would be taken.
It was contended that evidence showing claims disputes and attempted resolution
of the obligations
referred to in Defaults 1 and 8 before the negotiations
which led to the Consent Orders shows that it was the intention of the parties
that those claims be resolved by the Consent Orders; and it was said that this
was further shown by the terms of cl.10, together
with other provisions which
resolve property disputes. It was also submitted that if this is not so, that
the Notice of Default was
defective in that there would not be a default in
respect of an earlier obligation unless after 29 March 1999 there had been a
demand
for compliance; that is, that before a default could be relied on in a
default notice there would have to be an earlier demand for
compliance followed
by failure to comply.  It is not necessary to come to a conclusion on these
contentions.
<P>

27  	<b>Ground 4: No authorisation for delegation by cl.11. </b> The
authorisation to act as attorney for a defaulting party is conferred by cl.11
and is limited by the terms of that clause. The
clause authorises action to
preserve the Consent Orders and rectify any default. Further the means for
rectification are specified
by cl. 11, namely to execute documents, to make
payments and to deal with any matter in the ordinary course of business.  The
authorisation
conferred is far narrower than usually found in a general power
of attorney and is limited both to acts of the kinds designated and
to acts
performed for the purposes referred to.  A strict approach is taken to the
construction of powers of attorney; see <b>Tobin v Broadbent </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1947/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1947] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281947%29%2075%20CLR%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1947) 75 CLR
378</a> at 390-391 per Latham CJ.  
<P>

28  	Defendant's counsel contended that on the proper construction of
the consent orders the only action which can be taken under
cl.11 is action
which would overcome the actual default; and that what Mrs Mancini did or
purported to do could not constitute rectification
action in relation to the
defaults relied on.  There was no suggestion in evidence of any means by which
Mr Mancini's removal as
a director could resolve any of those defaults.
<P>

29  	In my opinion the acts performed by Mrs Mancini are outside the
scope of the power conferred by cl 11; first because none of
those acts
namely,  dismissal of Mr Mancini as a director, his or his attorney voting in
favour of a resolution that he be dismissed,
or his attorney attending a
meeting of directors or receiving or waiving notice of such a meeting, could
constitute rectification
of any of the defaults; and secondly because none of
those acts falls within the three classes of action authorised by cl11.  I
understood
Mrs Mancini's counsel to have relied on the last class relating to
the ordinary course of business but on no reasonable view could
the removal of
one of the two directors be so regarded.  On this ground also Mr Mancini is
entitled to succeed in the proceedings.
<P>

30  	<b>Ground 5: Incapacity of an attorney under power to act as a
director.</b>  The office of a director is a personal responsibility, and can
only be discharged by the person who holds the office.  If there
is any
exception, it must be found in the constitution of the company and in some
authorisation there found to act by an alternate
or other substitute or
delegate. The office of a director is not a property right capable of being
exercised by an attorney or other
substitute or delegate of the person holding
the office; many rights as shareholder can be distinguished in this respect
because
they are rights of property.  
<P>

31  	The Articles of Wesco Quarry Products Pty Ltd and Wesco Ready
Mixed Concrete Pty Ltd (Exhibits G and H) each incorporated Regulation
72 which
in subregulation (1) enabled a director with the approval of the other
directors to appoint an alternate director; and subregulation
(6) prescribed
the formal means of making such an appointment.  These procedures were not
followed and there was no purported appointment
as an alternate director. 
<P>

32  	Defendant's counsel submitted that the power to appoint
alternate directors in Regulation 72(1) is expressed in terms which
show that
the alternate is to be a person other than an existing director.  There has
been no express or purported appointment of
Mr Azzopardi as an alternate
director and in my opinion for none of the companies can provisions relating to
alternate directors
sustain his appointment.  The form of the resolutions by
which Mr Mancini was purportedly removed is altogether inconsistent with
the
concept that an alternate for him was appointed.  In the Articles of Wesco
Industries Pty Ltd Articles 96(r) enables a director
subject to the approval
for the other directors by writing under his hand to appoint qualified persons
to act in his stead as director.
 This procedure too was not followed.  The
presence in the articles of each company of provisions regulating delegation of
the office
of director shows, in my opinion, the only means by which such a
delegation can take place.  On this ground also Mr Mancini is entitled
to
succeed.
<P>

33  	<b>Ground 6: Lack of a quorum</b>.  In Wesco Quarry Products Pty
Ltd  the quorum for a meeting of directors is two; see Regulation 73 in the
Articles of that company
and of Wesco Ready Mixed Concrete Pty Ltd and Article
88 of Wesco Industries Pty Ltd.  This requirement cannot be satisfied by the
presence of one person who is the delegate of two different directors, or who
is a director and also the delegate of another director;
see Windeyer J in
<b>Equity Nominees Limited v Tucker</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1967/22.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1967] HCA 22</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%20116%20CLR%20518" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 116 CLR 518</a> at 526.  Mrs
Mancini's counsel contended that the observations of Windeyer J are limited to
articles dealing with affixation of the
seal.  It is true that that was the
subject under his Honour's consideration, but the expressions he used are of
wider application
and constitute a dictum which in view of his Honour's
expressed reasoning has high persuasive force.  Another view is supported a
Scottish decision of the same year, <b>Re Neil McLeod &amp; Sons Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%20SLT%2046" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967]
SLT 46</a> which Young J did not follow in <b>AW &amp; LM Forrest Pty Ltd v
Beamish</b> (Young J unreported 27 August 1998) at p.6.  The reasoning
expressed in the Scottish decision is I find quite unconvincing.  Even
if there
had been some effective delegation, Mrs Mancini could not constitute a quorum
by being present in two capacities.  On this
ground also Mr Mancini is entitled
to succeed.
<P>

34  	<b>Ground 7: Lack of good faith in exercising power under cl.11.
</b>Mr Mancini's counsel submitted that the manner in which Mrs Mancini
proceeded showed that her purported exercise of power under cl.11
of the
Consent Orders was not undertaken in good faith for the purpose for which the
power was conferred but was in fraud of the
power.  In support of this counsel
referred to the lack of connection between rectifying the nine defaults
asserted in the default
notice, only three of which were sought to be upheld in
final submissions, and the nature of the measures taken by Mrs Mancini under
colour of rectifying the defaults she purported to constitute a meeting of her
own in two different capacities, without the presence
of two persons who even
arguably might be a director and a representative of the other director, there
was no notice of the meeting
to Mr Mancini although the means of telling him of
the meeting in advance were readily available because of his attendances at the
office; in substance notice of the meeting was deliberately withheld from him
and it was done in secret and in concealment.  Counsel
also referred to Mrs
Mancini's difficulties in explaining her chosen course in evidence; she was
unable to give any explanation which
could be thought of as credible, and even
went to the extremity of claiming that she was acting for Mr Mancini's benefit.
Counsel
contended that Mrs Mancini's true purpose was not to compel
rectification of the defaults referred to in the Default Notice, but
to bring
about an alteration the company structure and a pattern of share holding and
office holding in which Mr Mancini would be
got rid of as a person who shared
control of the affairs of the companies.  Counsel pointed to the sequence of
events in which a
letter from solicitors to Mrs Mancini dated 2 June discussing
such a reorganisation became known to Mr Mancini on 3 June, when he
wrote a
letter of protest about it; after that the proceedings which ended in the
endeavour to remove him as a director began and
according to plaintiff's case
began on 9 June.  It was also contended that delivery of the notice of 9 June
when it was known to
Mrs Mancini that Mr Mancini planned to go on holidays the
following day and to be absent from New South Wales for about a week supported
finding that it was not her purpose to obtain rectification of the alleged
defaults by giving him (as she claimed) a week's notice
to rectify them at a
time when he would be absent from New South Wales.  
<P>

35  	Cross-examination of Mrs Mancini about her purpose produced an
unusual effusion of extraneous matter; however she did acknowledge
that his
discovery of the letter of 2 June brought things to a head and that she then
decided that his continued interference in
what she regarded as good governance
of the companies was intolerable and that he had to be got rid of.  As part of
this chain of
events it was suggested by the cross-examiner that the document
of 9 June was not brought into existence until some date later than
9 June;
however there is no evidence which would tend to establish this.  
<P>

36  	When I take the events which I have recited with the lack of
connection between the acts purportedly done under cl.11 of the
Consent Orders
and any means of rectifying what were alleged to be defaults, it appears to me
that this contention is correct.  I
find that the purported exercise of that
power by Mrs Mancini on 29 June was not an exercise in good faith of the power
for the purposes
for which it was conferred.  Mrs Mancini acted in fraud of
that power, and her acts lacked their purported effect.  For this reason
Mr
Mancini is entitled to succeed.
<P>

37  	<b>Ground 8:  Lack of power to remove director</b>.  Mrs
Mancini's counsel in his closing address conceded that for each company the
provisions of the constitution relating to removal
of directors did not
authorise removal by a resolution of the directors and had not been complied
with.  In relation to Wesco Quarries
Pty Ltd this appears from the constitution
in Exhibit G Regulation 62 which confers the power of removal on the company
and not on
the directors.  In the constitution of Wesco Ready Mixed Concrete
Pty Ltd Exhibit H Regulation 62 of Table A was deleted by Article
10 but
Article 9 provided for a substituted Regulation 61(2) by which "<i>Any person
so appointed shall hold office until removal by resolution of the company</i>".
No corresponding power was conferred on the directors.  Counsel also contended
that Regulation 57(2) as substituted by Article
9 governs removal from office
but on the text of Regulation 57(2) this is not so.  The constitution of Wesco
Industries Pty Ltd Exhibit
M clearly provides in Article 81 for removal by the
company in general meeting by special resolution.  There was no event which
even
in purport was a general meeting of members, or in the case of Wesco
Industries Pty Ltd a special resolution.  These provisions would
of themselves,
irrespective of the many other considerations on which I have adjudicated,
establish the lack of effect of the purported
removal of Mr Mancini from
office, the lack of effect of the purported appointment of Mr Azzopardi as a
director, and indeed the
entire lack of effect of the meeting as a meeting of
directors.  On this ground Mr Mancini is entitled to succeed.
<P>

38  	<b>Ground 9: the defaults did not occur as claimed.</b>  In his
closing address, after Mr Mancini's counsel had dealt in detail with several of
the defaults alleged, Mrs Mancini's counsel
told me that he did not wish to
address in support of defaults other than numbers 1, 4 and 8.  It appeared to
me that given their
nature and the state of evidence the other defaults could
not have been supported.  
<P>

39  	Default 1 relates to a payment which it is said should be made
to Wesco Industries Pty Ltd;  this could not be a basis for
any rectification
action in relation to the other two companies.  Default 8 in terms relates only
to Wesco Ready Mixed Concrete Pty
Ltd, and similarly could not be the basis for
action in relation to the other two companies.  Default 4 does not specify a
particular
company to which it is said to relate.  The evidence of Mr Mancini
(t42) shows that the mobile telephone which he used in, among
other things, the
Sinbad Promotions business, was paid for by companies in the Wesco Group.  The
evidence does not enable it to be
known which of the six companies named in the
Consent Orders if any paid the mobile telephone bills and whether any of the
three
subject of these proceedings did so.  
<P>

40  	Mrs Mancini's counsel contended in support of Default 4 that it
was a breach of the Consent Orders and a breach of duties of
good faith for Mr
Mancini to carry on the business of Sinbad Promotions.  It was something of an
overstatement to say that Mr Mancini
uses the Wesco Group address to operate
the business; he operates the business wherever he is, using his mobile phone
and vehicle;
he does not quote the company address as the address of Sinbad
Promotions, but he does give the telephone number of the mobile telephone
for
which the Wesco Group pays.  It was contended that it was a breach of a duty of
good faith and loyalty to the companies for him
to give any of his time to
Simbad Promotions.  In the absence of any special contractual arrangement it is
not the duty of a director
to give his undivided time to the company of which
he is director, and it is not his duty to have no other business.  However a
part
of Default 4 is arguably a breach of some (unidentified) clause of the
Consent Orders in that he has used the mobile telephone which
is paid for by an
unidentified company in the Wesco Group for other business. 
<P>

41  	Mr Mancini is probably accountable to whichever Wesco company
has incurred liability to Telstra for mobile phone charges for
a proper
proportion of the mobile phone charges.  However there could not be any
occasion for the exercise of the powers asserted
as a means of rectifying
default in accounting for the telephone charge.  
<P>

42  	Mr Mancini's counsel sought to defend his position in respect of
Defaults 1 and 8 on a number of bases including contentions
that the
obligations of the Consent Orders do not relate to events earlier than their
date and that the effect of cl.10 is that there
is no continuing obligation.
It is not necessary to resolve these issues, and they may well be taken up at
some future time on the
part of the two companies concerned.  
<P>

43  	The question whether the sum of $50,000 referred to in Default 1
was received by Mr Mancini in circumstances in which he is
accountable for it
to the company is an elaborate one, and the further question whether not
accounting for it after 29 March is a
default is also elaborate.  It is not
necessary to answer these questions, and I leave them unresolved.  I take a
similar view of
the alleged Default 8.  Nor do I think it appropriate to
adjudicate on the contentions of Mr Mancini's counsel to the effect that
cl.10
of the Consent Orders declares the rights of the parties in such a way as to
prevent Mrs Mancini from raising contentions such
as those in cll.1 and 8
arising out of transactions earlier than the Consent Orders. It is not
necessary for the disposition of the
Cross-claim that I make any adjudication
on whether Mr Mancini was in breach of the Consent Orders in any of the ways
alleged and
I come to no conclusion about that.
<P>

44  	Reliance on Defaults 1, 4 and 8 only has implications for the
decisions recorded in the Minutes of 29 June 1999.  For Wesco
Quarry Products
Pty Ltd the Minute records that "<i>Mrs Mancini informed the meeting that
default by Mr Mancini as detailed in the Notice at paras 3, 5 and 9 had not
been rectified by
Mr Mancini</i>".  That is, none of the defaults which are now
sought to be upheld was there expressly relied on.  In the minutes relating to
Wesco
Ready Mixed Concrete Pty Ltd several defaults were named, but Default 8
was the only one there named and now relied on, while In
the minutes of Wesco
Industries Ltd several grounds were named but Defaults 1 and 4 were the only
grounds there named and now relied
on.  However I would think that
consideration of the validity of the resolution is not limited to defaults
expressly referred to.
 Mr Mancini who bears the onus of proof has not excluded
any of the companies from the possible view that he is in default in respect
of
protecting and preserving its assets in not paying whatever part of the
telephone account is attributable to Simbad Promotions.
 However it is in my
view clear that defaults in paying $50,000 to Wesco Industries (Default 1) in
paying $6,372 to Wesco Ready Mixed
Concrete Pty Ltd and in paying whatever
should be paid on the telephone account to whichever company ought to receive
it (Default
4) could not on any view be thought of as rectified by resigning
office or being removed from office as a director, or by receiving
or waiving a
notice of a director's meeting; and those in substance are the rectifying acts
which are said to have been done under
the power of attorney.  If the defaults
happened, they were just as unrectified after those events as before them.  The
defaults
could not form a basis for the actions which have purportedly been
carried out. 
<P>

45  	In my opinion Defaults 1, 4 and 8, if they were defaults, which
I do not decide, could not be the basis of rectifying action
such as is
alleged.  On this ground also Mr Mancini is entitled to succeed.
<P>
