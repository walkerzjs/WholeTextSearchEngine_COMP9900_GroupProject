<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>	Norma Michael late of 8 Isabella Street Revesby New South
Wales, widow and age pensioner, was born on 14 August 1917 and died aged
78 in
the Bankstown/Lidcombe Hospital on 22 October 1995 of cardio-pulmonary arrest.
She suffered from congestive cardiac failure
over some years and had been
admitted to hospital on 21 October after a cardiac episode.  Late in her life
she had a number of health
problems including arthritis, and her mobility was
greatly restricted in her final months so that she moved with difficulty with
the aid of a stick or walking frame, and for some months before her death had
rarely left her house.  She was seen by Dr Yap, her
treating general
practitioner, on many occasions;  in his evidence he said "Her physical
condition shortly before death included
1. Asthma 2. Iron Deficiency 3. Poor
Nutrition 4. Heart Failure (mild)" and that she was in need of constant care.
On 16 October
1995 his notes included "query dehydrated" and on 17 October a
note that he had advised other occupants of her house "needs to improve
her
nutrition".  At that time she was largely bedridden, but not completely so.
<P>

2	     Notwithstanding her age and state of health Mrs Norma Michael was of
ordinary soundness of mind, memory and understanding;
 there is no reason to
doubt her capacity to express her wishes and make a will.  These facts were not
disputed and there is no evidence
which could cast any doubt on them.
<P>

3	     The plaintiff is the daughter of Mrs Norma Michael, who was also
survived by two sons, Barry and Stephen Michael.  In proceedings
in solemn form
the plaintiff propounds for probate a document allegedly executed by Mrs Norma
Michael as her last will at her house
on 17 October 1995.  Mrs Norma Michael
made at least two earlier wills, the later being a will of 27 July 1995
executed at her house
in the presence of two officers of the Public Trustee, of
which the Public Trustee obtained a grant of probate in common form.  That
grant was completed before the solemn-form proceedings began, and was
unopposed, in the absence of a caveat.  The plaintiff claims
revocation of the
common form grant.  If the plaintiff does not succeed, administration by the
Public Trustee will continue under
the will of 27 July 1995.
<P>

4	       Mrs Norma Michael's only asset of substantial value was her house,
which is not subject to mortgage.  The Public Trustee
estimated its value at
$210,000.00.  She had other assets of relatively small value;  furniture, a
bank deposit.  She had liabilities
of $7,099.96 for unpaid municipal rates, and
another debt for a small sum.
<P>

5	     The will of 27 July 1995 gave all her property to the first defendant Mr
Darren J J Michael, her grandson.  Other gifts in
the will did not take effect.
The document of 17 October 1995, which was hand-written by the plaintiff on a
printed will form, appoints
the plaintiff as executrix, gives all furniture and
household effects to Mr Darren J J Michael, gives Mrs Norma Michael's brother
Ronald Owen $20,000.00 and makes gifts which would divide the residuary estate
equally between four persons, namely her two sons,
her daughter and Mr Darren J
J Michael.
<P>

6	      Both documents appear to me to be entirely credible versions of what
Mrs Norma Michael in her situation in life and having
regard to her family
relationships might have decided to do.  It is reasonable and credible that she
may have decided to give her
estate wholly to her grandson, who had led a
troubled life and who shared her household for long periods, including a recent
period.
 On the other hand it is credible too that she may have decided, in the
exercise of her powers of testation, to make the benefactions
in the document
of 17 October 1995.  Neither is in any way inofficious or an unlikely form for
her testamentary dispositions to take.
<P>

7	     The first defendant Mr Darren J J Michael took the active part in
resisting the plaintiff's claim and was represented at
the hearing by his
solicitor and counsel.  The Public Trustee was joined as second defendant at a
late stage and filed a submitting
appearance.
<P>

8	      The plaintiff and the two attesting witnesses Mr D J North and Mrs V L
Cornelissen gave evidence of the preparation and
execution of the will on 17
October 1995 in their presence, in Mrs Norma Michael's bedroom at her house in
Revesby, and their evidence
if true clearly shows that the document should be
admitted to probate.  The first defendant's defence is a general denial;  that
is the defence is that the document was not signed by Mrs Norma Michael at her
house on 17 October 1995,  the plaintiff and the attesting
witnesses did not go
to the house then, no such event happened, the document is forged and does not
truly bear Mrs Michael's signature
at all.  The plaintiff bears the onus of
proof of her claim for probate, and the standard of proof is the balance of
probabilities.
 The first defendant does not bear an onus of proof that the
document is a forgery.
<P>

9	      The plaintiff and the attesting witnesses gave in evidence narrations
of the events of preparing and executing the will
which substantially
coincided;  the few discrepancies or supposed discrepancies were on the most
minor and incidental matters and
were not of kinds which could disturb
confidence in their evidence.  There was no evidence of any strong previous
association among
these three persons.  The plaintiff's evidence was to the
effect that she obtained a will form about 18 months before Mrs Norma Michael
died at Mrs Norma Michael's request.  The will form was given to her by Ms
Margaret Foat, who is Mr Stephen Michael's de facto wife.
 The plaintiff told
Mrs Norma Michael that she had the form, and she put it away in a drawer at Mrs
Norma Michael's request.  In
or about September 1995, 6 weeks before Mrs Norma
Michael died, Mrs Michael asked her about the will form again.
<P>

10	     Then on the afternoon of 17 October 1995 at about 4 pm Mrs Michael
asked Mrs Lynch by telephone to come to her house and
bring the will form,
saying "I really want to do it now."  At about the time that this request came
Mr Don North was present at Mrs
Lynch's home as a visitor;  he was a friend of
Mrs Lynch and had met Mrs Michael but did not know her well.  Mrs Lynch asked
Mr North
to attend and witness the will and he agreed.  She also telephoned Ms
Foat and asked her;  she said "Maybe I shouldn't because I
am too close to the
family" and arranged for a friend of hers, Mrs V L Cornelissen, to attend as a
witness.  Mrs Cornelissen was
a friend of Ms Foat and of Mr Stephen Michael,
but had not previously met Mrs Norma Michael, Mrs Lynch or Mr North.
<P>

11	     Ms Foat took Mrs Cornelissen to Mrs Lynch's home, and Mrs Lynch, Mr
North and Mrs Cornelissen proceeded in Mrs Lynch's car
to Mrs Michael's home.
They entered the house through the front door (which was ajar) and went to Mrs
Norma Michael's bedroom, which
Mrs Lynch knew well.  After introductions Mrs
Michael told Mrs Lynch her wishes and Mrs Lynch wrote them out, using the form.
At
that stage Mr North and Mrs Cornelissen did not pay close attention.  Then
the document was read to Mrs Norma Michael who signed
it whilst still in bed,
using a book as backing, and the attesting witnesses then signed it.  Mrs Lynch
and the witnesses then left
and returned to Mrs Lynch's house.  They did not
encounter Mr Darren Michael or any other person while at the house.
<P>

12	       Mrs Lynch and the attesting witnesses were cross-examined, with
appropriate firmness in view of the nature of the issue,
and in my view nothing
emerged from the cross-examination which in any way shook what they had said,
introduced any significant qualification
or showed any matter adverse to
credit.  Mrs Lynch's interest is obvious as she stands to gain a quarter of the
residue.  However
the attesting witnesses have no apparent interest, and are
related to the events only by pre-existing friendship between Mr North
and Mrs
Lynch, and between Mrs Cornelissen and Mr Stephen Michael, who also has a
quarter share of residue.  When I attempt to assess
the probabilities of their
evidence being wholly untrue it seems to me quite significant that they are
associated only in these ways
and are not shown to be otherwise associated
together, to have known each other well or in way to have formed a closely
associated
group before they were assembled out of the people who could be
gathered together with a few inquiries on the afternoon of 17 October.
 These
circumstances make it very unlikely that they joined together to concoct a
false case about the events of that day, and adhered
to it throughout the
intervening period and while giving their evidence.  If there had been any
stronger association among them,
then the matter would appear differently,
particularly in view of what they said in evidence about what the association
among them
truly was.
<P>

13	     Each of them gave me a favourable impression in terms of demeanour as a
witness.  Mrs Lynch in evidence showed signs of
emotional involvement, which is
understandable of the parties in this case having regard to the nature of the
issue and the family
relationships and property to which they relate.  However
the attesting witnesses appeared to me to be quite dispassionate.
<P>

14	     The first defendant's case brought forward two bodies of evidence for
consideration.  One was the evidence of Mr Christopher
Anderson, a handwriting
expert, showing reasons for his view that the document dated 17 October 1995
was not signed by Mrs Norma
Michael.  This view was based on comparison with
specimen documents which, as was claimed, bore her signatures or were
handwritten
by her.  His first report dated 1 September 1997 used as specimen
documents the will of 25 July 1995, which can be taken without
any doubt to
have been signed by Mrs Michael, a number of partly completed or otherwise
blank withdrawal forms bearing her signature,
and several letters which were
treated as specimens of her handwriting.  His second report dated 25 March 1998
addressed the date
written on the document of 17 October 1995 as well as the
signature and concluded that they were not written by Mrs Norma Michael.
 This
report took a much larger body of specimen writings into account, including one
letter which appeared to bear Mrs Norma Michael's
signature.
<P>

15	     The evidence which would establish that the specimen writings in fact
were those of Mrs Norma Michael was presented in a
very disorderly and jumbled
fashion, and it was obvious from the course of the hearing that the need to
show by evidence that the
specimen writings were really written by Mrs Norma
Michael had not been addressed or indeed understood by those representing the
first defendant until the hearing was in progress.  My procedural decisions
allowing admission of such evidence were made at the
expense to some extent of
the quality of the procedural justice available to the plaintiff and those
representing her to deal with
the genuineness of the documents.  Proof that the
specimen documents are those of Mrs Norma Michael depends entirely on the
credit
of the first defendant, whose evidence was that he found the withdrawal
forms in Mrs Norma Michael's bedroom on or about the day
after she died, and
that he found the other specimen documents in her bedroom at about the same
time or at a later stage when he
made another search;  by that stage some of
them had been gathered up in a box and stored elsewhere in the house.  The
events relating
to collection of documents and the times at which they were
collected have not been proved in a full or even in a clear way.  There
is no
clear evidence that they are hers from anyone who knew her handwriting well.
There are some anomalies about the letters, and
many of them could well be, as
evidence (which appeared to me to be speculative) suggested, letters which Mrs
Norma Michael wrote
out directed to family members but did not actually send,
so that they express her feelings but are not communications.  Others however
could credibly be copies which she retained of letters which she had sent.
Their contents relate to family matters and from their
subject and style could
have been composed by Mrs Norma Michael.
<P>

16	      Mr Anderson's evidence included detailed exposition of what he
observed on examination of magnifications of the writing,
and of what he saw as
anomalies in pen movements and formation shapes of letters.  He made only the
faintest of qualifications of
his conclusions.  When cross-examined he adhered
to his position, but he became verbose and argumentative and some of the
positions
he adopted seemed rather strained;  especially as to whether the
Housing Commission letter bore a signature.  I treat Mr Anderson
and his
expertise with respect, but I have to take his opinion evidence with the clear
and to my observation unimpeached evidence
of three persons who fully describe
the event as having happened on 17 October 1995 and as including Mrs Norma
Michael writing the
date and signing the will.  Given her declining state of
health, even to the point of the adverse observations of Dr Yap on 16 or
17
October 1995, it does not seem surprising to me that there should be small
anomalies in the penmanship and in the marks which
she made when examined with
microscopic detail.
<P>

17	Mr. Anderson referred to some matters as indicia of forgery, namely:-
<P>

18	
<P>

(a)   a slowness and deliberation in the writing;
<P>

(b)   pen lifts in places where pen lifts would not be expected to occur;
<P>

(c)   blunt line endings or beginnings;
<P>

(d)   lack of fluency in the writing;
<P>

(e)   tremor or hesitation in the writing;
<P>

(f)   subtle patching or retouching of strokes.
<P>

19	     He illustrated these indicia with macro-prints of aspects of the
signature which he interpreted as pen lifts and signs of
patching or
retouching.  He also pointed to some aspects of the formation of spacing of
letters and of the handwriting which in his
interpretation showed significant
differences between the specimens on the withdrawal slip and the disputed
handwriting on the alleged
will.
<P>

20	      In his supplementary report, which was prepared after seeing a large
number of further documents he expressed his conclusion
somewhat more firmly
than before.  He gave his observation that the specimen writings exhibit
evidence of a deteriorating writing
ability, where the writer is having
difficulty in maintaining fluency, being able to write along the baseline and
being able to form
letters legibly.  In contrast, he said that the questioned
writings, while slow and deliberate, are legibly formed with a constant
writing
pressure;.  there is no evidence of deteriorated writing.
<P>

21	     Mr. Anderson was cross-examined at great length and in a combative
spirit, on the part of the cross-examiner and also of
the witness.  Mr.
Anderson was not objective at all times while under cross-examination, although
in relation to the nature and manner
of the challenge to his evidence it would
be rather difficult for any witness to remain objective.  His answers did not
always engage
the question, and he showed some tendency to point to matters
which had already appeared elsewhere and were not strictly responsive
to
sustain his position.  The thrust of his evidence was very largely an appeal to
the weight of his expertise to persuade the Court
to accept his conclusions
overall.
<P>

22	     Detail by detail, the particular aspects of the handwriting to which he
referred do not strike me as giving strong support
to the conclusion that the
questioned writing was forged; overall the anomalies to which he referred
appear to me to be very minor
and to be consistent with the situation of a
person in very poor health taking studied care to sign an important document in
a deliberate
and careful way and on an unusually solemn occasion.
<P>

23	     Cross-examination went to close detail of a number of matters of
formation of letters and other aspects of the writing,
including formation of
the cross-bar, the indications whether or not pressure was constant in the
writing and, the phenomenon of
gaps between letters.  Of particular
significance was the passage in evidence about the formation of the "o" in
"Norma"; Mr. Anderson
seemed to have difficulty in acknowledging that this was
an incomplete letter as written, although it is optically evident that it
is.
<P>

24	     In appraising Mr. Anderson's evidence it remains significant, at all
stages of my approach, that most of the specimen writings
put forward were not
proved in any full or clear way to be the writings of the testatrix, except by
the evidence of the defendant
about where he found them.  While on the whole
there are factors which make it seem more likely than not that writings
purportedly
of the testatrix and found in her room or in her house after her
death were written by her, the proofs are not full or clear and
they come
through the defendant, who is a person who has suffered convictions for
dishonesty.  The defendant did not bring forward
all the supposed specimen
writings at appropriate times, although he claims to have anticipated even
before the testatrix died that
he would be confronted with a forged will.  His
evidence was not frank in relation to the withdrawal slips, as he spoke in
evidence
of eight withdrawal slips whereas there was at least one other which
he used to make a dishonest bank withdrawal after the testatrix
had died.
<P>

25	     The contents of many of the letters which are put forward among the
secondary specimen writings also leave a miasma of doubt
over whether they are
genuine; on the one hand they show familiarity with the testatrix's affairs
including family affairs, but on
the other hand they speak of events which are
unlikely to be correct and express views which she is unlikely to have held.

<P>

26	      These  things mean that there are aspects of uncertainty even about
the specimen writings which are the bases of Mr. Anderson's
considerations.  It
must always be remembered that the defendant does not bear any onus of proof.
At the same time the nature and
seriousness of the contention put forward that
the will was forged has to be kept in view while finding the facts.  If Mr.
Anderson's
evidence and the evidence relating to the specimen writings were
looked at in abstraction from the rest of the evidence in the case,
it must be
said that I did not find it convincing, but its force was not destroyed.
Before finding the ultimate facts I have to weigh
it with the evidence of three
persons who say that they were actually present and saw the event, and I must
say that they carry conviction
with me, and altogether outweigh the force of
Mr. Anderson's evidence.
<P>

27	      It was the evidence of the plaintiff that the testatrix wrote very
carefully when she signed the document.  The plaintiff
observed no tremor and
did not remember that the testatrix touched up any of the writing.  Mr. North
said that the testatrix seemed
to take her time while signing the document.  He
did not see the testatrix go over the signature, meaning, as I understand him,
that
he did not see her over-write or touch up the signature.  The defendant's
evidence is that at the time the testatrix could hardly
write her name and her
hand was quite shaky.  It is I think significant to keep in mind that at the
time when the plaintiff alleges
that the testatrix signed the document, she was
suffering from many adverse conditions of health, she was in the last days of
her
life, she had been, in everyday language, an invalid for many months and
was almost bedridden.  She cannot have felt strong, or felt
confident.
<P>

28	      The other body of evidence in the first defendant's case is evidence
of Mr Darren Michael himself and of Mrs Maxine Leary
which would establish that
Mrs Lynch and two other people did not come to the house on the afternoon of 17
October 1995, and that
there was no opportunity for an attendance on Mrs Norma
Michael when she could have made such a will as is alleged.
<P>

29	     At times Mr Darren J J Michael's evidence showed signs of strong
feeling, with intrusion of passages which were irrelevant
or overstated, but
events like this are not uncommonly encountered in litigation which is likely
to generate strong feelings, affecting
family property and dealing with close
relationships.  Indeed there were some signs, rather less marked, of emotional
involvement
in Mrs Lynch's presentation of her evidence.
<P>

30	     A large number of matters were put to Mr Darren Michael as affecting
his credit, and some of these had no real impact. 
For example I do not think
that any real force can be attributed to a brief note made by an officer of the
Public Trustee recording
an account given by telephone by Mr Michael of what
his case was at an early stage;  I would not feel that his credit was injured
if he gave a less than complete account then, and it seems clearly possible
that the note made was less than complete.  I thought
too that his difficulties
in recollecting whether the two Public Trustee officers who attended the house
in July 1995 were both women
or whether one was a man has no real significance
for appraisal of his credit.
<P>

31	     However reliance on the first defendant's evidence is very severely
shaken by the knowledge that he has on several occasions
been convicted of
offences of dishonesty, for which he has been punished severely including
imprisonment twice.  It was also strongly
adverse to his credibility that on
the day after Mrs Norma Michael's death he used a withdrawal form signed by her
(and there is
no evidence, as plaintiff's counsel suggested, that the signature
was forged) to withdraw a sum of money from one of her bank accounts.
 Any
person observing common standards of honesty would know that money should not
be obtained from a bank by the use of a withdrawal
form signed by someone who
has already died, and that the only honest thing to do is to report to the bank
that its customer has
died.  The defendant introduced into evidence his own
difficulty in remembering matters of detail (t100).  His evidence about finding
the withdrawal slips and the number of them that he found was incorrect, in
that he did not mention one which he cashed, and in the
context of what he did
with it this was a serious inaccuracy.  The first defendant was significantly
inaccurate, to the extent of
several hours, in giving the time of Mrs.
Michael's removal to hospital on the day she died.  I do not regard the first
defendant
himself as a witness on whose credit much reliance could be
placed.
<P>

32	     The defendant and Ms. Maxine Leary both gave evidence about their
movements, habits and routines in terms which would support
a finding that they
were present at the house at the times on the afternoon of 17 October when
according to the plaintiff's case,
the plaintiff and two other persons
attended, and the testatrix made a will.  Two other persons, namely, Mr. Owen
and Mr. Gavan,
made affidavits which were read, at a time in the hearing when
it was expected that they would attend for cross-examination, purportedly
in
support of the case that no person attended the textatrix at the time when it
is said that she made a will.  However, Mr. Owen
and Mr. Gavan did not attend
for cross-examination, there were no circumstances which supported a grant of
leave to read their affidavits
although they did not attend, and in the
circumstances, their affidavits must be treated as if they had never been read.
In any event,
other evidence relating to Mr. Owen and his habits shows that,
because of his habitual inebriation, he would not have been in a position
to
make an observation on which any reliance could be placed.
<P>

33	       Ms Leary's evidence was based, in my view, more largely on her
recollections about her own routines than on any actual
recollection or
knowledge of the events of 17 October 1995.  It is not entirely clear that if
Ms Leary or the first defendant or
both had been present at the house when the
plaintiff with two witnesses called on the testatrix late in the afternoon and
remained
for a period which may have been three quarters of an hour, or perhaps
as long as an hour, the attendance of the plaintiff and her
party would
necessarily have been observed.  It seems possible, although unlikely, that
neither party may have seen the other, as
the plaintiff and those with her had
no occasion to look for anyone except the testatrix or to go anywhere except to
her bedroom
and then leave.  It seems possible, although unlikely, that both
groups of persons were present, but did not encounter each other.
 It seems
rather more likely that, as acceptance of the plaintiff's case would seem to
require, the first defendant and Ms Leary
were absent for some reason for the
relatively short time of the visit.  In deciding this issue of fact the weight
which I attributed
to the evidence of the plaintiff and the alleged attesting
witnesses is decisive.
<P>

34	      The two bodies of evidence adduced by the first defendant have been
altogether outweighed in my judgment by the favourable
impression which I
formed of the credibility of the plaintiff and her witnesses and what I regard
as the overwhelming probability
that their evidence is not the product of any
conspiracy or contrivance among them.  I have a marked preference for what I
regard
as the clear evidence of three eye-witnesses over adverse conclusions to
be based on Mr Anderson's expert examination.
<P>

35	       I find that the document bearing date 17 October 1995 propounded by
the plaintiff is in fact the last will of the testatrix
and was in fact duly
executed by her as her will in the presence of the attesting witnesses on the
date it bears.  I find that it
is not a forgery and it truly bears the
testatrix's signature.  I will pronounce in favour of that will and admit it to
probate in
solemn form.
<P>

36	The orders are:-
<P>

(1)	Give judgment for the plaintiff and grant to the plaintiff probate in
solemn form of the will of the testatrix made on 17 October
1995.
<P>

(2)	Order that probate in common form granted on 29 November 1995 to the Public
Trustee, the second defendant, of the will of the
testatrix dated 27 July 1995
be revoked.
<P>

(3)	Order that the first defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings
and direct that the plaintiff retain the costs payable
by the first defendant
under this order out of the share of the assets of the testatrix passing to the
first defendant under the
will of 17 October 1995 so far as the same shall
extend.
<P>

(4)	Order that the costs of the second defendant, the Public Trustee, as a
submitting defendant, be paid by the plaintiff out of
the assets of the
testatrix.
<P>

I hereby certify that paragraphs 1-36 are the reasons for judgment of the
Honourable Justice John Bryson.      Dated 1 February
1999.
