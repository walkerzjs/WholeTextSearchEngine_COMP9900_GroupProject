WALES<br>EQUITY DIVISION - COMMERCIAL LIST<br><br>EINSTEIN J<br><br>SYDNEY 19
August 1999<br><br><b>50113/98   Idoport Pty Limited &amp; Anor v National
Australia Bank Limited &amp; ors.</b><br><br><b>JUDGMENT</b><br><br><b>The
Proceedings</b><br><br>1   	These proceedings concern the
dealings between the parties relating to the exploitation of an Automated Market
Quotation System
called &#8216;AUSMAQ&#8217;.  Prior to the parties entering
into interrelated contracts on 13 September 1996 which commenced in operation
on
6 November 1996, Market Holdings Pty Limited [&#8216;Market Holdings&#8217;], a
company controlled by Mr J.M. Maconochie and interests
associated with him,
directly or indirectly owned and controlled the various intellectual and
industrial property rights in the software
and other information materials and
works used to provide the AUSMAQ service.  Idoport [&#8216;JMG&#8217;] which is
a company subsequently
incorporated for the purpose of providing consultancy
services referred to hereunder and which is now controlled by Mr Maconochie,
presently seeks interlocutory relief principally on the asserted basis that it
is necessary to preserve the subject matter of the
litigation pending the final
hearing of the proceedings.<br><br>2   	Before identifying the
parties with more precision, it is convenient to immediately turn to an
explanation of the AUSMAQ system
against a background context in which the
Australian Securities Commission [the &#8220;ASC&#8221;] held a series of public
hearings
in 1993 before authorising the establishment of the system which in due
course resulted in the necessity for the Corporations Law
to be amended to
include section 770A and for the Australian Securities Commission to exempt the
operator of the system from compliance
with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p7.12" class="autolink_findacts">Part 7.12</a> of the Corporations Law in
relation to the offering of securities.  A copy of the ASC instrument of
exemption [PX 2/610] is appended
to the judgment as Appendix &#8220;A&#8221;.
<br><br>3   	The principal contracts under examination in the
proceedings defined the &#8216;AUSMAQ service&#8217; in identical terms.  The
subject definition was:<br><br><i>&#8216;AUSMAQ Service&#8217; means the service
of providing an automated securities trading system and related services known
as the
Australian Market Automated Quotation System or Ausmaq System or Euromac
regardless of its name and includes but is not limited to,
the holding of
Securities and Entitlements for clients, the provision of a related deposit
facility, execution of Securities transactions
with related client portfolio
administration and reporting <u>and any service with the equivalent or similar
functionality,</u> and any enhancements, modifications and additions to the
service anywhere in the world&#8217;.</i>	<br><i>		</i>[emphasis
added]<br><br>4   	A brief description of the system, and of the
interest of the National Australia Bank Limited [&#8216;the Bank&#8217;] in
acquiring
the AUSMAQ business, by what it called &#8220;Project Electra&#8221;,
is to be discerned from the following excerpt from a memorandum
dated 6 December
1996 sent by Mr Breeze of the Bank to Mr GLL Barnes, the Chairman of
NMG:<br><br><i>&#8216;1.	AUSMAQ is a &#8216;straight through&#8217; securities
trading/settlement/principal/ portfolio/reporting system which can
effect
real-time transactions in financial markets.  It is based on the central
depository model for cash and securities, whereby
cleared cash and securities
are credited to each client principal&#8217;s portfolio account on the system,
which then permits simultaneous
transaction and settlement as a book entry on
the counterparty client accounts. </i><br><br><i>The NMG/Ausmaq business has the
ability to provide the automated infrastructure for managed products (and other
securities) distribution,
trading, dealing group management and control, and
real-time automated client account management.  We see this has application to
client discretionary investment accounts, client tax-advantaged accounts (for
example Tax Exempt Savings Accounts) and payment systems.</i><br><br><i>2.	The
Group&#8217;s interest in acquiring the AUSMAQ business was based on <u>the
changing nature of our business, the unbundling of product function from the
customer service function</u>, and the constant pressure to reduce costs.  The
AUSMAQ business scores highly in each of these areas and we believe represents
<u>the way forward for the delivery and support of customer-focused
services&#8217;</u>.</i><br>[PX 1742-1743]	[emphasis
added]<br><br>5   	Whilst noting that the
&#8220;functionality&#8221; of the system was the subject of evidence before the
Court on the hearing
of the motion, and will be examined in more detail below,
for present overview purposes it is sufficient to describe the essential
elements of the system in the words used by the plaintiffs in their
submissions:<br><br><i>&#8216;*	It is a computer system which is located on
main-frame computers located in Brisbane which are operated by the Queensland
Government Centre for Information Technology and Communications
(&#8220;CITEC&#8221;).  Users of the AUSMAQ system are connected
by terminals
and land lines to the CITEC computers in Brisbane and thus to the AUSMAQ system
itself which comprises a suite of computer
programs.</i><br><br><i>*	AUSMAQ
operates as a market.  It enables dealers and vendors of financial products to
meet in an electronic market place, to buy
and sell such products, and to settle
such transactions immediately.  Customers of AUSMAQ include funds managers,
dealers and financial
institutions.</i><br><br><i>*	AUSMAQ has the ability to
operate as a stock exchange, but presently has not been approved to do so.  Its
features include those
of other automated settlement systems such as SEATS and
CHESS, but it also has the ability to handle all types of financial instruments
and securities, including land.</i><br><br><i>*	A vital part of AUSMAQ system is
a central facility called &#8220;INSTACLEAR&#8221; which holds cash and
securities on behalf of
customers of AUSMAQ (ie. clients of dealers) and enables
automatic and immediate settlement of transactions.  The advantages of such
a
system are clear when settlement times on conventional systems are considered. 
For example, settlements on the Australian Stock
Exchange take up to 5 days, and
up to 60 days for units in mutual funds.</i><br><br><i>*	Clients&#8217; funds
are held by a trustee called the &#8220;Depositee&#8221; pursuant to a Deposit
Funds and Management Agreement.
 Before the sale in 1996, the Depositee was the
Australian Industry Development Corporation (&#8220;AIDC&#8221;) which held
deposit
accounts as trustee on behalf of each AUSMAQ customer.  The customers
did not have accounts in their own names.</i><br><br><i>*	The Depositee is now
the NAB itself, and clients of AUSMAQ have been required to open accounts with
the NAB in their own names.
 The Plaintiffs contend that this change has had
serious and deleterious consequences for the independence of the AUSMAQ System
and
hence for NMG&#8217;.</i>	<br>				[Plaintiffs&#8217; overview
submissions]<br><br>6   	Prior to the contractual agreements of
late 1996 earlier referred to, the intellectual property rights for the AUSMAQ
Service
had been licensed by Market Holdings to AUSMAQ Limited which had in turn
sublicensed those rights to the operating company, Australian
Market Automated
Quotation (AUSMAQ) System Limited [&#8216;AUSMAQ Systems&#8217;].  AUSMAQ
Limited was placed into voluntary administration
on 30 June 1996 when Mr Walker
of Ferrier Hodgson was appointed administrator.<br><br>7   	In
the latter portion of 1996, upon the completion of successful negotiations
between Mr Maconochie, Market Holdings, JMG and
Mr Walker of the one part and
the Bank and companies associated with it of the other part, the contracts to
which earlier reference
has been made were entered into, providing inter alia,
for the restructure of the group of companies of which Ausmaq Systems was
a part
[&#8216;the Restructuring Agreement&#8217;] and for the entry of relevant
parties into a Consulting Agreement [&#8216;the
Consulting Agreement&#8217; or
&#8216;the Consultancy Agreement&#8217;].  Broadly, these agreements achieved
the transfer by Market
Holdings and the other shareholder in Ausmaq Limited to a
company taken off the shelf and renamed National Markets Group Limited
[&#8216;NMG&#8217;], of the legal ownership of the shares in Ausmaq Limited and
of the intellectual property rights to the AUSMAQ
system itself.  NMG at the
same point in time became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank.  In general
terms, these transfers to
NMG were in consideration of monetary payments to be
made to third parties and the right to a performance bonus once the profit
produced
by the system reached a predetermined level.  A set of potential
&#8216;buy out&#8217; procedures was also provided for in the contractual
agreements, dealing with entitlements to invoke such procedure some seven years
after the commencement of the agreements, according
to a predetermined formula. 
Importantly, the agreements also included stringent conditions by way of
covenants, by JMG, inter alia
to the effect that it would not by itself nor any
related body corporate &#8216;be directly or indirectly engaged, concerned or
interested
whether on its own account or as a member, shareholder, consultant,
agent, beneficiary, trustee or otherwise in any enterprise corporation,
firm,
trust, joint venture, or syndicate which is engaged, concerned or interested in
or carrying on any business the same as or
substantially similar to or in
competition with that conducted by [NMG or Ausmaq Systems] and any of their
related Bodies Corporate
from time to time who would accede to the Consulting
Agreement.  [Consulting Agreement, clause 12.1].<br><br>8   	The
date for the final hearing of the proceedings has not yet been fixed.  That
hearing is anticipated by the defendants to take
at least six months by way of
Court hearing time.  The present state of the proceedings is such that a final
hearing date will not
be fixed prior to the commencement of the year 2000.  The
defendants have stated that they will resist a fixture prior to mid 2000
and
even then have indicated that such a fixture could presently only be regarded as
&#8220;provisional&#8221;.  The hearing date
is dealt with below.  The
probabilities of an appeal from a decision of a trial judge in a case such as
the present are high.  In
general terms, it is unlikely then that a final
resolution of the proceedings on a final basis, following any appellate
proceedings,
could be expected to be reached until in all likelihood the year
2002, if that.<br><br>9   	The burden of the plaintiffs&#8217;
application for interlocutory relief is the allegation that in flagrant breach
of their obligations
under the Consulting Agreement, the defendants have
prevented JMG from performing its obligations under that agreement and have by
their conduct [said to include the development by the Bank of services
infringing the intellectual property rights to the AUSMAQ
system], threatened
&#8216;the subject matter of the litigation ... [being] the undertaking,
business and goodwill of the NMG Group
in relation to the Ausmaq Service&#8217;
[plaintiffs&#8217; overview submissions paragraph
2.2.1.]<br><br>10   	The Plaintiffs in overview submissions put
the matter as follows:<br>	<br><i>The Plaintiffs seek interlocutory relief
substantially to preserve the subject matter of litigation pending the final
trial of these
proceedings, including the appointment of a receiver and manager
of the assets, business and undertaking of &#8220;NMG&#8221; and
to certain
parts of the undertaking of &#8220;NAB&#8221; and NATIONAL AUSTRALIA FINANCIAL
MANAGEMENT LIMITED (&#8220;NAFM&#8221;)
as enable NAB to control appointment to
the Board of NMG or as are employed in relation to the development of certain
e-commerce
services which the plaintiffs contend should be e-commerce services
developed and conducted through NMG and the NMG Group. </i>[paragraph
1.1.1]<br>	<br><i>The Plaintiffs seek this relief because they believe they have
no other choice in view of their wish to continue to perform their
obligations
under the Consulting Agreement, which is ongoing, and in view of the
following:</i><br><br><i>The apparent deliberate disregard by NMG and NAB of
their contractual obligations under the Consulting Agreement dated 13 September
1996 with effect from 6 November 1996 pleaded in the Second Further Amended
Statement of Claim in these proceedings (the &#8220;Statement
of Claim&#8221;
and the &#8220;Consulting Agreement&#8221;), which was an Agreement entered into
after substantial technical, legal
and financial due diligence had been carried
out by NAB, its solicitors Arthur Robinson &amp; Co and its accountants KPMG;
and</i><br><br><i>The complete failure and refusal of the Defendants to respond
to any matter of substance raised or recommended by Idoport Pty Limited
(&#8220;JMG&#8221;) concerning the conduct of the Consulting Agreement and the
business of NMG and the NMG Group (primarily the global
exploitation of the
AUSMAQ Service) from August 1997 to date; and</i><br><br><i>The apparent
attempts by commission and omission by NMG through its Board at the direction of
NAB to damage, perhaps irretrievably,
the business, undertaking and goodwill of
NMG and the NMG Group in relation to the AUSMAQ Service which have continued and
recently
increased; and</i><br><br><i>The substantial liability for damages
and/or equitable compensation which NMG. NAB and the other Defendants are
incurring by the continued
wrongdoing which, if it results in the destruction of
the business, undertaking and goodwill of NMG and the NMG Group in relation
to
the AUSMAQ Service and the impossibility of performing the Consulting Agreement,
will be beyond the capacity of all the Defendants
to meet, even NMG if it calls
upon NAB&#8217;s unlimited Guarantee of its obligations under the Consulting
Agreement, and NAB, as,
upon the Plaintiffs&#8217; case, the quantum of damages
in such an event may well amount to USD21 billion and thus may exceed the
NAB&#8217;s shareholders&#8217; funds by an amount in excess of USD10 billion. 
</i>[paragraph 1.1.2]<br>	<br><i>There is very strong evidence in this case that
the Defendants are destroying the business of NMG by (most recently) refusing to
pursue
or accept an offer from an international corporation for the Ausmaq
System customers (for example, a UK mutual fund), which would
generate many
millions of dollars in annual revenue for NM; by alienating present customers at
the highest level, by refusing to
permit the development and to implement
business plans in accordance with the Consulting Agreement, by imperiling the
technical and
integrity and security of the AUSMAQ Service and its licence and
exemptions under the Corporations Law, and by engaging in the other
behaviour
complained of by the plaintiffs (see Mr Maconochie&#8217;s longer affidavit of 2
June 1199).  </i>[paragraph 2.5.3]<br>	<br><i>This is a similar case to
</i>Mercator Property Consultants Pty Ltd v Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd
<i>(unreported, Federal Court, 29 July 1998, Nicholson J) where a receiver was
appointed to a company whose major asset, its casino licence,
was in danger of
being revoked or canceled.  The strength of the evidence in this case may be
contrasted with the evidence in </i>Jones v Australia Pacific Hotels Pty Ltd
<i>(unreported, Supreme Court of SA, 26 February 1998,) in which Lander J held
that the application was refused because the evidence
did not establish that
there was a possibility that the assets controlled by a trustee may be
dissipated or wasted.  </i>[paragraph
2.5.4]<br><br>11   	Accepting immediately the severe difficulties
which lie in the plaintiffs&#8217; path in endeavouring to obtain interlocutory
relief by way of appointment of receivers or by way of what may be referred to
as &#8216;indirect specific performance of an extant
contract&#8217;, the
plaintiffs assert that in what is alleged to be the extremely unusual
circumstances of the instant proceedings,
the Court&#8217;s discretion is
enlivened so as, according to principle and in the exercise of the
administration of justice, to
furnish the plaintiff with all or some of the
relief now pressed.  That the case is an unusual one is at the least made plain
by:<br><br>(a)	the application to appoint a receiver of certain assets of the
Bank;<br><br>(b)	the plaintiffs&#8217; claim that the Bank is exposed by its
widely framed guarantee [&#8220;of the performance of all money under
which NMG,
whether alone or with any other person, is or at any time may become actually or
contingently liable to pay to or for
the account of JMG for any reason whatever
under or in connection with clause 7 of the Consulting Agreement&#8221;], to
claims within
a range of US $271million as at 2003, said to increase
indefinitely to US $21billion or more, being claims which, if successful,
are
said to exceed the value of the Bank&#8217;s shareholders&#8217;
funds.	<br>				[Transcript for 26 July 1999 page
41]<br><br>12   	The Court&#8217;s jurisdiction to grant
interlocutory relief is of course tailored to the individual circumstances of
any particular
case and is exercised according to principle applied to those
circumstances.  Undaunted by the obvious difficulties in the path of
the grant
of the wide ranging interlocutory relief sought at this stage in the
proceedings, the plaintiffs pursue that relief.<br>13   	The
plaintiffs in overview submissions put the matter as follows:<br><i>&#8216;In
this case, although </i><br><br><i>*	the Consulting Agreement and the
Restructuring and other Agreements associated with it were entered into by NAB
and NMG after extensive
legal due diligence by NAB&#8217;s solicitors, Arthur
Robinson &amp; Co, and commercial, financial and technical due diligence by
NAB
and its auditors KPMG,</i><br><br><i>*	the decision on the part of NAB to enter
into the Agreements was made by the full NAB Board after a full presentation to
it,</i><br><br><i>*	the NAB studies for that presentation  contain documents
largely supporting the Plaintiffs&#8217; case concerning the true construction
and effect of the Consulting Agreement, and </i><br><br><i>*	JMG has endeavoured
to perform its obligations under the Consulting Agreement and has complained in
writing about apparent and continuing
breaches of it and associated breaches of
fiduciary duty for almost two years,</i><br><br><i>the Defendants&#8217; conduct
has continued and is continuing, and JMG&#8217;s complaints have been met almost
entirely with a wall
of silence, with no reply on the merits, even in the
affidavits filed on this application in answer to the matters most recently
relied on by JMG in Mr Maconochie&#8217;s longer affidavit of 2 June 1999
(leaving aside an attempt to reply on some technical matters,
which JMG will
contend substantially admits its complaints).</i><br><br><i>This is
extraordinary behaviour for an organisation of the size and apparent standing of
NAB, and is not consistent with a </i>bona fide <i>attempt to properly perform
the Consulting Agreement and to accord JMG its rights under and associated with
the Consulting Agreement&#8217;.
</i>[paragraphs 2.6.5 and
2.6.6]<br><br>14   	I return to set out in more detail what has
at the most been merely the briefest of overviews of some of the
issues.<br><br><b>The Parties to the
Proceedings</b><br><br>15   	JMG and Market Holdings are the
first and second plaintiffs.  The Bank is the first defendant.  NMG is the

set out the Plaintiffs&#8217; summary of the case and of their complaints as set
out in their
overview submissions:<br><br>&#8216;<b>3.	The Serious Questions to
be Tried</b><br><br><i>The claim which JMG and Market Holdings make against NAB,
NMG and the other proposed respondents is set out in detail in the Second
Further Amended Statement of Claim and further amplified in the Particulars of 9
October 1998 (Annexure A to this Overview) and the
Further and Better
Particulars (Annexure B to this Overview).  The Plaintiffs&#8217; complaints
arise principally in connection with
the Consulting Agreement, and may be
categorised under the following headings:</i><br><br><i>3.1.	<u>Contraventions
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> by misleading and deceptive
conduct</u></i><br><br><i>JMG and Market Holdings complained of initial
misrepresentations by NAB, which lead them to enter into the Restructure
Agreement and
related agreements including the Consulting Agreement, and to
attempt to perform the Consulting Agreement.  They also complain of
subsequent
misrepresentations of both NAB and NMG, and of subsequent and continuing
misleading and deceptive conduct of NAB and NMG
in relation to the
implementation and administration of the Consulting
Agreement.</i><br><br><i>3.2.	<u>Breaches of provisions of the Consulting
Agreement</u></i><br><br><i>3.2.1.	JMG complains that both NMG and NAB have
breached or procured the breach of the Consulting Agreement.  It should be
understood
that although the agreement is called a &#8220;Consulting
Agreement&#8221;, it is not merely that.  The Consulting Agreement provides
not
only for a consultancy Service Fee to be paid to JMG, but also for a Performance
Bonus to be paid to JMG, being 13.5% or 12.5%
of the gross income of NMG and
companies in the NMG group, and any other entity falling within the
Agreement&#8217;s definition of
an &#8220;Operating Entity&#8221;, that is an
entity that uses or provides the Ausmaq Service and the Ausmaq IP (including
their
functional equivalents whether or not obtained from or supplied by NMG and
the NMG Group) as defined in the Agreement.  On JMG&#8217;s
case, those
Operating Entities include NAB and any division or subsidiary of NAB which
provides a service which is functionally equivalent
to or similar to that of
Ausmaq, capturing most types of electronic commerce in intermediate financial
markets.  </i><br><br><i>3.2.2.	JMG claims that NMG, at the instigation of NAB,
has failed to implement the Consulting Agreement and to involve JMG in the
implementation of the Consulting Agreement as provided in the Consulting
Agreement, has misappropriated the Ausmaq IP and Service
for the benefit of NAB
and its associated entities, and has delayed the commercialisation of the Ausmaq
Service in accordance with
the Consulting Agreement, thereby depriving NMG and
the NMG Group of income and JMG of its Performance
Bonus.</i><br><br><i>3.3.	<u>NAB&#8217;s inducing breach of
contract</u></i><br><br><i>3.3.1.	JMG also complains that NAB has induced and
procured NMG to breach the Consulting Agreement, and indeed has done so while
using
NMG&#8217;s confidential business and technical information and other
intellectual property rights to develop elsewhere within NAB
and its
subsidiaries functions and services which should have been developed in NMG and
its group.</i><br><br><i>3.3.2.	Consequently JMG claims substantial damages
which can be identified at this time arising from breaches of the Consulting
Agreement
due to lost Performance Bonuses because of inadequate, delayed or
failed commercialisation of NMG and the Ausmaq Service in accordance
with the
Consulting Agreement and the commercialisation of the Ausmaq IP and functional
equivalents of the Ausmaq Service by NAB
and its associates outside the NMG
Group.  These claims involve breaches not only of express and particular
provisions of the Consulting
Agreement, but of implied terms in the Consulting
Agreement (based generally speaking on the obligation of a party to an agreement
not to frustrate and prevent the operation of the agreement, but to co-operate
in the performance of the agreement).</i><br><br><i>3.4.	<u>Breaches of
fiduciary duty</u></i><br><br><i>3.4.1.	JMG also claims breaches of fiduciary
duties owed by NMG and NAB to JMG.  A fiduciary relationship of a significant
but limited
nature is claimed arising out of the position and relationship of
the various parties and the obligations in the Consulting Agreement.
 The basis
is indicated in detail in the Statement of Claim.  While the matters relied upon
in breach of fiduciary duty overlap to
a large extent with the breaches of
contract,  the consequences in law are somewhat different.  The test for
causation in relation
to equitable compensation for the breach of fiduciary duty
is quite different from that for breach of contract, and, in effect, puts
the
onus on the party in breach of fiduciary duty to show why it should not pay
compensation for or disgorge all profits in respect
of the wrongful
act.</i><br><br><i>3.4.2.	Claims for participation in NMG&#8217;s and
NAB&#8217;s breaches of fiduciary duty and contraventions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices
Act</a> are made against NAB and the Directors of NMG, three of whom are Senior NAB
executives.</i><br><br><i>3.5.	<u>Return of the Ausmaq IP and Unjust
Enrichment</u></i><br><br><i>A claim is also made for the return of the Ausmaq
system and related industrial and intellectual property, effectively seeking
that
the restructure Agreement and the Consulting Agreement be
&#8220;undone&#8221;.  The claim calls upon the powers of the court under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 87</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a>, should it find a contravention of the Act. 
This claim depends very much on the totality of the evidence as it comes during
and
at the end of a trial. </i><br><br><i>3.6.	<u>The claim in
contract</u></i><br><br><i>3.6.1.	The express and implied obligations relied
upon and the construction of the Consulting Agreement and the effect of the
terms
contended for are set out in paragraph 12-18 of the Statement of
Claim.</i><br><br><i>3.6.2.	In the Further and Better Particulars, the basis of
the implied terms was particularised as follows:</i><br><br><i>Paragraph
18</i><br><br><i>Request</i><br><br><i>The matters set out in the "Further
Particulars of Statement of Claim &#8220;dated 9 October 1998 in relation to
paragraph 18 do not

each alleged Implied term in subparagraphs 18.1 to 18.5, please identify the
facts, matters and circumstances alleged
to give rise to that implied term
including: </i><br><br><i>where reference is made to an agreement, the precise
Clause or Clauses of the agreement referred to or relied upon,
</i><br><br><i>where reference is made to a document,. the part of that document
relied upon: and </i><br><br><i>where reference is made to a conversation:

particulars supplied are quite sufficient to enable the Defendants to plead. 
The matters you request are matters of evidence.
 The basis of the
Plaintiffs&#8217; case in this respect has previously been made quite clear in
the particulars supplied.</i><br><br><i>As stated in the Particulars of
Statement of Claim dated 9 October 1998, each of the terms is implied, and it is
contended that each
is implied:</i><br><br><i>as a matter of law (see, for
instance, Mackay v Dick (1880-1881) 6 App Cas 251 and Trego v Hunt  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1896%5d%20AC%207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1896] AC 7)</a>,
and</i><br><br><i>as a matter of necessary implication, from the other terms of
the Consulting Agreement, and/or</i><br><br><i>as a matter of fact, as implied

its terms and reasonable,

Agreement and the Restructuring Agreement and related agreements referred to

matters pleaded in paragraphs 8, 9, 12, 16, 17 and 20

Claim and further particularised in the Particulars of Statement of Claim dated
9 October 1998 and previously
supplied and in the particulars in this

on are the definitions in Clause 1.1, and clauses 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11,
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 and Schedule 2.</i><br><br><i>3.6.3.	The factual matrix
relied upon in this regard is found in the history of the negotiations for and
entry into the Restructuring
Agreement, the Consulting Agreement and related
Agreements.  See:</i><br><br><i>Maconochie First Statement paras 7 to 16 and the
documents numbered and identified therein:</i><br><br><i>Hume First Statement

relationship</u></i><br><br><i>3.7.1.	The facts and matters relied upon to
establish a fiduciary relationship are set out in paragraphs 19 &#8211; 27 of
the Statement
of Claim.</i><br><br><i>3.7.2.	The relationship the Plaintiffs
with NMG and the NAB is one in which arose out of the purchase of the Ausmaq
System in 1996
and was defined, in particular, by the Consulting Agreement and
the representations made by the Defendants to the Plaintiffs from
July 1996
onwards.  The result of the completion of the transactions in November 1996 was
to place where the NAB and NMG in a position
where they are in control of the
AUSMAQ  system and its ability to make profits and thus affect the payment of
the performance bonus
to the Plaintiffs.  The NAB and NMG thus are in a position
to affect the interests of the Plaintiff in both a legal and a practical
sense,
the Plaintiffs are vulnerable to abuse of that power, and the relationship is
therefore fiduciary in character:  Hospital

representational case is not relied upon by the plaintiffs in relation to the
relief sought on the motion,
but the facts detailed in the particulars of
precontractual communications were said to be relied upon within the principles

Wales </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR 337</a><i>, </i>as materials which may be legitimately
resorted to for the purpose of the construction of ambiguous or imprecise terms
in the written
contracts or for the purpose of dealing with the implied term
case propounded by the plaintiffs.<br><br><b>The Proper Construction of the
Consultancy Agreement</b><br><br>21   	The breach of contract
case raises centrally questions of construction of the Consulting and
Restructuring Agreements.  It is
not going too far to say that the respective
contentions as to the proper construction and interrelationship of clauses 3 and
4 of
the Consultancy Agreement, are of critical significance to the
plaintiff&#8217;s contractual case and may well be determinative of
the
plaintiff&#8217;s fiduciary obligations case.<br><br>22   	One
crucial question is whether properly construed, these provisions leave entirely
at the unfettered discretion of NMG by its
authorised officer, the entitlement
to give or to withhold from giving, instructions to JMG to perform particular
services, including
the preparation of business
plans.<br><br>23   	On the defendants&#8217; construction of
these clauses, there is no obligation whatever upon NMG to &#8216;ascribe&#8217;
or
to allot to JMG, the performance of any services whatever.  On the
plaintiff&#8217;s submissions, the substratum of the Agreements
and the proper
construction of clauses 3 and 4 of the Consulting Agreement, make plain that at
the least and without any ascription
to JMG by an authorised officer of NMG of
any obligation to perform particular services, JMG has a contractual right to
the strict
compliance by NMG with the provisions of clauses 4.1 and
4.2.<br><br>24   	JMG&#8217;s case is that its entitlement to
participate at all meetings of the management committee of NMG in the fashion
provided
for in clause 9.3 of the Consultancy Agreement and its entitlement as
said to be provided for in clause 4.1(a), to meet with the
management committee
of NMG at least 90 days before the end of the financial year (or at such other
time as agreed by NMG and JMG),
&#8216;to review the objectives of [NMG and
Ausmaq Systems] regarding the operation, development and commercialisation of
the Ausmaq
Service throughout the world&#8217;, were (a) fundamental terms of
the Agreement and (b) terms which were inserted for the purpose
of recognising
the special interest of JMG [and through it Mr Maconochie], in the worldwide
operation, development and commercialisation
of the Ausmaq service and in being
able to speak to and play a real part in the management committee&#8217;s
deliberations and decisions.
 These are, as I understand the plaintiff&#8217;s
submissions, said to be clear from both the express terms of the Consulting and
associated agreements and also from surrounding circumstances in the form of
&#8220;mutually known facts&#8221;, said to be admissible
in aid of construction
as part of an objective setting in which the contract is to be construed.  In

surrounding circumstances in the form of &#8220;mutually known facts&#8221; to
identify the meaning
of a descriptive term&#8221; and it may admit evidence of

the matter in <i>Codelfa, </i>at 352:<br><br><i>&#8216;The true rule is that
evidence of surrounding circumstances is admissible to assist in the
interpretation of the contract if
the language is ambiguous or susceptible of
more than one meaning.  But it is not admissible to contradict the language of
the contract
when it has a plain meaning.  Generally speaking facts existing
when the contract was made will not be receivable as part of the
surrounding
circumstances as an aid to construction, unless they were known to both parties,
although, as we have seen, if the facts
are notorious, knowledge of them will be
presumed&#8217;.</i><br><br>26   	The construction issues are
dealt with below.  I note presently NMG&#8217;s submission that clause 4.1(a) of
the Consultancy

least 90 days before the end of the financial year or at such other time as

Motion</b><br><br>27   	Both plaintiffs to the proceedings are
applicants on the amended notice of motion which was filed on 4 June 1999. 
Market Holdings
was not, however, a party to the Consultancy Agreement, although
it was a party to the Restructuring Agreement.  The effect of the
Restructuring
Agreement was relevantly for a transfer by Market Holdings of all intellectual
property rights to the AUSMAQ system
so that for all intents and purposes the
notice of motion may, as Mr Garnsey QC for the plaintiffs accepted, be regarded
as one in
which the effective applicant is JMG.<br><br>28   	The
first two paragraphs in the notice of motion seek the appointment of a receiver
and manager of various companies, shares
and assets.  The third and following
paragraphs seek restraining orders pending the determination of the proceedings
or further order
and in some cases seek mandatory injunctive relief.  The ninth
paragraph deals with orders seeking that accounts be
kept.<br><br>29   	A schedule to the amended notice of motion
sets out the powers sought to be conferred upon receivers and managers if
appointed.<br>30   	A short summary of the relief sought in the
notice of motion as filed on 4 June 1999 taken from the plaintiff&#8217;s
overview

-</b><br><br>32   	The defendants&#8217; extensive written
submissions included the following:<br><br><i>&#8216;The correct approach to the
evaluation of the claims to interlocutory relief requires <u>more than just an
assessment of whether there is a serious question to be tried as to their
validity</u>. This is so because the grant of the relief sought would displace
proprietary rights clearly vested in NMG, when the evidence shows
no
countervailing proprietary rights even arguably vested in the Applicants. They
do not claim any proprietary right as supporting
their alleged entitlement to
interlocutory relief. <u>There is no serious question to be tried</u>; but even
if there were it would, given the disruptive reach of the relief sought, be
inappropriate to grant any of it because:</i><br><br><i>(a)	there is no evidence
of any actual or threatened violation of any proprietary or other rights vested
in the Applicants;</i><br><br><i>(b)	there is no evidence of imminent danger of
loss if the relief sought were not granted;</i><br><br><i>(c)	it is not shown
that damages would be an inadequate remedy;</i><br><br><i>(d)	the parties
seeking relief do not have the financial ability to honour an undertaking as to
damages;</i><br><br><i>(e)	the balance of convenience is tilted decisively in
favour of the Respondents;</i><br><br><i>(f)	there are discretionary factors
negating the appropriateness of the relief sought (eg,
laches)&#8217;.</i><br>	<br>	[Overview Submissions paragraph 4]  [Emphasis
added]<br><br><b>Suggested Difficulties with the Relief Sought in the Notice of
Motion</b><br><br>33   	The defendants&#8217; description of the
relief sought in the Notice of Motion, and of some of the difficulties with that
relief,
is put as follows:<br><br><i>&#8216;(a)	Prayer 1 seeks interlocutory
relief by way of the appointment of a receiver and manager of the assets
business and undertaking
of NMG, the 2nd Defendant, and each other company in
the NMG Group of Companies except Ausmaq Systems, the 4th Defendant. The exact
identity of the companies sought to be subjected to receivership is unclear: see
(b) below.</i><br><br><i>(b)	Prayer 2 seeks the appointment of a receiver and
manager of all shares held directly or beneficially by NAB (1st Defendant) or
NAFM (3rd Defendant) or by &#8220;any other company in the NAB group of
companies in NMG, AUSMAQ SYSTEMS or any other company in
the NMG group of
companies&#8221;. A lack of precise identification of the companies against
which the order is sought is a proper
matter for
objection.</i><br><br><i>(c)	Other parts of the prayers for relief in para 2 are
objectionable for the uncertainty of their reach. See particularly the reference
in prayer 2.4 to assets &#8220;reasonably required&#8221; to fund the
development of the AUSMAQ Service.</i><br><br><i>(d)	Prayer 3 seeks against all
the Respondents an interlocutory injunction restraining them from dealing in any
way with the assets
business or undertaking of NMG, AUSMAQ Systems and the other
companies in the NMG group. This amounts to a suggested restraint on
each
Respondent from dealing with its own assets except in the ordinary course of
business. The evidence provides no basis for such
relief.</i><br><br><i>(e)	Prayer 4 seeks interlocutory specific execution of the
Consulting Agreement on the basis that the interpretation of it propounded
by
the Applicant is correct. In principle this is an inappropriate remedy;
particularly so given the dispute concerning the correct
interpretation of that
agreement. The Defendants&#8217; detailed submissions on that issue are set out
below.</i><br><br><i>(f)	Prayer 5 seeks an interlocutory mandatory order that
NAB fund on an open ended basis the development of the AUSMAQ Service. The
Consulting Agreement provides no basis for such an
order&#8217;.</i><br><br><b>The Defendants&#8217; Analysis of the Relief Sought
in the Proceedings and of the Suggested Difficulties with Aspects of the Causes
of Action</b><br><br>34   	In their overview submissions the
defendants dealt with the plaintiffs&#8217; claims to relief as
follows:<br><br><i>&#8216;The main relief sought in these proceedings is in the
nature of unliquidated damages for contraventions of s52 TPA and breach
of
contract. The Applicants&#8217; outline of submissions (para 2.4) asserts
standing as unsecured creditors, which the Applicants
are not. They go on to
allege, (para 2.4.4) that their remedies at law are inadequate &#8220;because
... the Defendants are in breach
of their fiduciary duties&#8221;. This is
simply meaningless. The Applicants bring this claim to interlocutory relief on
the basis
of a claim for unliquidated damages. The assertion of a breach of
fiduciary duty cannot improve their position on the issue of liability.
It is
true that there is, as against NMG, a claim articulated in para 26 of 2nd FASOC
that it owed to JMG the obligations of a fiduciary
in relation to seven topics
therein enumerated. However, matters pleaded as giving rise to such a fiduciary
obligation are incapable
of doing so. For example, para 26(a) asserts the
matters pleaded &#8220;in paras 9 to 12 above&#8221; as doing so. But when one
turns
to para 9, one finds that the allegations therein are confined to
misrepresentations said to have been made by NAB (the 1st Defendant).
Para 10
does not impugn any conduct of NMG; nor do paras 11 and 12. Thus one finds as
part of the framework of an allegation of fiduciary
misconduct on the part of
NMG a series of allegations about another corporate entity. Such disordered
pleading should not be countenanced.</i><br><br><i>Para 26(b) invokes as matters
giving rise to fiduciary obligations owed by NMG to JMG &#8220;the facts matters
and circumstances alleged
in paragraphs 13 to 15 and
18&#8221;.</i><br><br><i>Para 13 sets out what are said to be express or implied
terms of the Consulting Agreement.</i><br><br><i>Para 14 simply embodies clause
4 of that Agreement.</i><br><br><i>Para 15 pleads more terms as express
provisions of the Consulting Agreement.</i><br><br><i>Para 18 asserts 5 implied
terms.</i><br><br><i>There is no allegation in para 26(b) of facts capable of
elevating any of the contractual terms pleaded to the level of fiduciary
duties.
It is quite erroneous to plead contractual provisions as in themselves
prescribing fiduciary obligations: the only fiduciary
duties recognised by
equity are proscriptive in nature, not prescriptive. A fiduciary may not take a
profit from his position without
fully informed consent; a fiduciary may not
act, without such consent, in a situation of conflict between self interest and
duty
or between opposing duties: Breen v Williams (186 CLR 71 at p113). A
principal error in the present formulation of the Applicants&#8217;
case is it
treats breaches of contract as equivalent to breaches of fiduciary
duty.</i><br><br><i>Para 26(c) contains no allegation against
NMG.</i><br><br><i>JMG&#8217;s last throw in paragraph 26 is to rely on the
matters alleged in paras 20 to 25 as subjecting NMG to the obligations of
a
fiduciary. The key assertion is that in the administration of the Consulting
Agreement NMG occupied &#8220;a position of dominance&#8221;.
In the context of
the present litigation that is a meaningless slogan because on no view of the
pleaded facts can the Applicant&#8217;s
case be squeezed into some kind of undue
influence claim based on the occupancy by any of the Defendants of a position of
ascendancy
of the kind dealt with in Johnson v Buttress ((1936) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1936] HCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=56%20CLR%20113" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">56 CLR 113</a> per
Dixon J at pp134-135); see also Breen v Williams ((1995-1996) 186 CLR 71 per
Brennan CJ at p82). The key question is whether
under that Agreement NMG agreed
&#8220;to act for and on behalf or in the interests of&#8221; JMG &#8220;in the
exercise of a power
or discretion which will affect the interests of&#8221; JMG
&#8220;in a legal or practical sense&#8221;: Hospital Products ((1984)
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">156 CLR
41</a> per Mason J at pp96-97). The answer to that question is a clear negative
because nothing in the Agreement imposed upon NMG a duty
to act &#8220;for or on
behalf of or in the interests of&#8221; JMG. In this connexion it is significant
that clause 10.1 of the
Consulting Agreement requires JMG &#8220;at all
times&#8221; to act &#8220;in the best interests of and to the benefit and
advantage
of&#8221; NMG. In these circumstances no implied obligation on the
part of NMG to act in the interests of JMG could arise: &#8220;expressum
acit
cessare tacitum&#8221;. This is fatal to the Applicants&#8217;&#8217; assertion
of fiduciary obligations in the present case.</i><br><i>Even if (which is
disputed) the Consulting Agreement imposed upon NMG a contractual obligation to
take into account as a relevant
factor the interest of JMG in obtaining the
payment of a performance bonus when considering what course to take in relation
to the
utilisation and development of the Ausmaq Service, it does not follow
that any such obligation was of a fiduciary character; it was
not imposed on NMG
in a representative capacity: see </i>Breen v Williams<i> (186 CLR 71 per Dawson
and Toohey JJ at pp92-93). It would be contrary to principle to superimpose upon
a contractual relationship
in which NMG was clearly entitled to pursue its own
interests in ways that might affect adversely JMG&#8217;s interest in the
payment
of a performance bonus, any duty of undivided loyalty owed by NMG. The
attempt to invoke fiduciary principles in the present case
is an example of an
&#8220;over ready tendency to reach for the amplitude of (the) fiduciary
remedy&#8221; in cases which do not
require it: cf </i>News Ltd v ARL<i> ((1996)
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1996/870.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] FCA 870</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=139%20ALR%20193" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">139 ALR 193</a> at pp310-311).</i><br><br><i>Even if a fiduciary obligation were
established, such an outcome would not necessarily justify the creation of a
constructive trust
so as to give rise to the appointment of a receiver as an
appropriate remedy. Although a claim to constructive trust relief is articulated
in 2nd FASOC, it is significant that the Applicants&#8217; written submissions
make no reference to such relief. This understandable
reticence is doubtless due
to a recognition that such a claim, ie to proprietary relief, would be
unfounded.</i><br><br><i>While an interlocutory proceeding may not be the
appropriate environment for reaching a final conclusion negating the existence
of
fiduciary duties of the kinds so tenuously propounded in 2nd FASOC, the
strength or weakness of the fiduciary claims in this case
is a vital factor for
consideration when the drastic remedy of receivership is pressed in
circumstances where (as here) it can have
no possible substance unless at the
very least there is a serious question to be tried as to the appropriateness of
a constructive
trust remedy over the assets of one or more of the defendants.
But, as submitted above, both authority and the justice of the case
require that
before severe remedies of the kind sought in the notice of motion are granted,
more than a serious question to be tried
must be demonstrated.</i><br><br><i>The
allegations of breach of fiduciary duty do <u>not constitute a serious question
to be tried</u>. The claim to relief on the basis of constructive trust is
ill-founded and seems not now to be pressed.</i><br><br><i>If the artificial
cladding of a fiduciary duty case is tripped away, the Plaintiff is driven to
seeking the appointment of a receiver
and manager in aid of claims for
unliquidated damages for alleged breaches of contract and alleged contraventions
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>.</i><br><br><i>The claim articulated in para 22 of
2nd FASOC as to the existence of a partnership or joint venture between NAB, NMG
and JMG is negated
by the terms of clause 1.4 of the Consulting Agreement. While
a contractual denial of the existence of a partnership is not necessarily
conclusive as negating it, nothing it he evidence serves to impugn such denial.
The express provision in clause 10.1 of the Consulting
Agreement, taken in
conjunction with clause 1.4, is wholly inconsistent with the creation of a
partnership or joint venture as contended
in para 22.5 of 2nd
FASOC.</i><br><br><i>To appoint a receiver and manager of the assets and
undertaking of NMG or NAB in the circumstances established by such of the
evidence
in support of the motion as is admissible would be contrary to
principle for the following reasons:</i><br><br><i>The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> does
not provide for the interlocutory appointment of a receiver in aid of a claim
for damages for misleading/deceptive conduct.</i><br><br><i>The drastic
equitable remedy of receivership will not be granted in aid of a claim for
unliquidated damages against companies (such
as the defendants) not shown to be
insolvent and not shown to be bent upon disposing of assets to defeat any
judgment that may be
obtained against them; and against whom, on the true
construction of the relevant contract, there is no serious question to be tried
as to any of the multiple alleged breaches of contract: NAB v Bond Brewing
((1991) 1 VR 386); ((1990) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/10.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 10</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=169%20CLR%20271" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">169 CLR 271).</a></i><br><br><i>The Applicants&#8217;
evidence in support of this motion does not show that a remedy by way of
damages, contractual or equitable,
would be inadequate. The appointment of a
receiver, with all the attendant consequential harm to NMG, would be totally
inappropriate:
NAB v Bond Brewing <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/10.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 10</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=169%20CLR%20271" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(169 CLR 271</a> at p277).</i><br><i>If, assuming
its admissibility (which is denied), one has regard to the quality of the
evidence relied upon to support the claim that
Idoport&#8217;s loss would sound
in billions of dollars, the assertion that the supposed size of the damages
claim supports an order
for receivership is fanciful. It would be contrary to
principle to appoint a receiver and manager of solvent companies on the ground
that a very large, but wholly untested, claim for damages is made against them.
In the nature of things an interlocutory hearing
is not a proper forum for
testing such a claim.</i><br><i>The appointment of a receiver and manager would
be more disruptive of the business of the Defendant companies than a Mareva
injunction.
In effect such an appointment would be a species of equitable
execution by way of the provision of security in advance of judgment,
when there
is no evidence of a risk that any of the Defendants will dispose of assets so as
to defeat a judgment: cf </i>Jackson v Sterling Industries Ltd<i> ((1987) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=162%20CLR%20612" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">162
CLR 612</a> per Brennan J at p621). The degree of potential disruption is
illustrated by the fact that the Plaintiffs&#8217; motion even seeks
to empower
the receiver/manager to conduct the defence of the current proceedings. Such a
claim is absurd and unprecedented.</i><br><br><i>The application is fatally
flawed because, quite inconsistently with the terms of the Consulting Agreement,
it seeks (prayer 1) to
displace the contractual discretion of NMG concerning the
extent to which JMG shall be employed as consultant. Further, the notice
of
motion seeks in substance that the proposed receiver and manager shall act in an
entrepreneurial role, quite at odds with the
proper function of such an
appointee. The notice of motion really seeks orders for the administration of
NMG on the footing that
the Plaintiffs are entitled to succeed on their various
claims; it seeks therefore much more than the preservation of the status
quo.</i><br><br><i>The affidavit of Alan Copsey sworn 16 July 1999 proves that
the appointment of a receiver and manager of NAB as sought in the Notice
of
Motion may expose NAB itself to the potential termination of funding and other
significant agreements that it has with third parties:
see paras
91-119&#8217;.</i><br>[Emphasis added]<br><br>35   	In their
final submissions, the defendants addressed the application for receivership
orders as follows:<br><br><b><i>&#8216;2	Application for receiver of NMG (Para
1)</i></b><br><br><i>2.1	It is submitted that are a number of independent
reasons why the application for the appointment of a receiver to NMG is fatally
flawed.</i><br><br><i>2.2	The evidence of Tanya Cox is that Ausmaq System
conducts the Ausmaq business and that NMG does not (affidavit of Tanya Cox
affirmed
15 July 1999 paras 18 and 19). In those circumstances, the appointment
of a receiver to the assets of NMG would be futile.  The appointment
of a
receiver does not vest title to the assets of the company in the receiver. A
receiver of NMG would have no power to control
Ausmaq System which would remain
in the control of the directors of that company.</i><br><br><i>2.3	Even if it
were possible to appoint a receiver to NMG by reference to the business of
Ausmaq System, there is no evidence of imminent
danger of loss. The evidence is
that decisions have been made to carry on business in a particular way (eg not
in Europe until the
system proves itself in Australasia (DX1 at 382, DX1 at
359). Decisions such as this are a matter of business judgment. It is not
possible for the Court to say whether the decision will be successful or not.
The Court has no function to speculate in this regard.
It is not the function of
the Court to appoint a receiver and manager whenever parties disagree about the
course which a business
should take.</i><br><br><i>2.4	The evidence of Mr
Maconochie suggests that one of the main reasons why he seeks the appointment of
a receiver and manager is
so that new &#8220;opportunities&#8221; to develop the
business can be exploited. If a receiver and manager were to be appointed
and
were to enter into contracts to exploit these new opportunities, he would be
personally liable: Moss Steamship Co Ltd v Whinney

2834.</i><br><br><i>2.5	A receiver and manager is not appointed for the purpose
of conducting business in accordance with the wishes of one of the parties,
a
fortiori where that party has no rights of control or even voting: Sovereign
Bank of Canada  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1913%5d%20AC%20160" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1913] AC 160</a> at 166-7; Buckley v Bennell Design &amp;

Lehane, 3rd Ed at para 2841. A receiver is appointed to fulfil the role of
company caretaker,
not to restore profitability. The receiver must preserve
those assets of the company upon which its fortunes may be dependent so
that the
assets are available when the dispute between the parties is resolved: see Duffy
v Super Centre Development Corporation

no standing except as claimants for unliquidated damages. Their sole interest in
the business is to receive
service fees or performance bonuses, when payable.
Damages (if payable) are an adequate remedy. The claim to billions of dollars
in
damages is a purely academic claim. There is no evidence of present damage.
(Also, as to the level of damages, see Maconochie&#8217;s
own projections which
show that as at December 1996, he did not expect the business to have a
cumulative positive cash flow until
June 1999 - Maconochie 1st statement  para
21 and PX 5/1984)</i><br><br><i>2.7	The Applicants are guilty of extraordinary
delay in proceeding with the application for the appointment of a receiver. This
delay
is of two varieties. First, there is ample evidence of the plaintiffs
complaining of certain conduct of the defendants upon which
they now seek to
rely, in 1997 and 1998 (see for example in relation to Europe, Annexure 1 to
these Submissions). By June 1998, the
Applicants asserted that there was the
need for interlocutory relief (DX1 at 109, 135-137). Yet they did not commence
proceedings
until 24 September 1998.  That delay of itself was fatal to any
application.</i><br><br><i>2.8	The second variety of delay concerns a delay
after the commencement of the proceedings. Between the period of the filing and
serving
of the summons and draft statement of claim and the first directions
hearing in October 1998, the plaintiffs&#8217; solicitors on
a number of
occasions (see, for instance, letter of Withnell Hetherington dated 8 October
1998 (DX1 at 259)) expressed an intention
to seek the appointment of a receiver
on an interlocutory basis. However, the plaintiffs did not proceed with such an
application
in October 1998 and it was not until June 1999 that the application
was made. </i><br><br><i>2.9	In the case of an interlocutory application such as
the present, the court will refuse to grant relief where the delay is relatively
short (see eg Carlton and United Breweries (NSW) Pty Ltd v Bond Brewing New
South Wales Ltd <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1987/412.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] FCA 412</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2076%20ALR%20633" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 76 ALR 633).</a> Here, there has been gross delay. Further,
in the interim, the Respondents have continued to conduct and fund the business
on the
assumption that that is their right.</i><br><br><i>2.10	A further defence
is provided by the fact that a Court will not exercise its power to appoint a
receiver merely because applicants
have a valid cause of action. To do so would
amount to the Court requiring the defendants to give security for the
applicants&#8217;
claim: see National Australia Bank Ltd v Bond Brewing Holdings
Ltd <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1991/31.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] VicRp 31</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20VR%20386" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 VR 386</a> at 553.</i><br><br><i>2.11	Further, the plaintiffs must
provide an adequate undertaking as to damages. Such damages flow inevitably from
the fact of the
appointment of the receiver and of the defendants&#8217; loss of
control over its assets and affairs: see National Australia Bank
Limited v Bond
Brewing Holdings Limited <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/10.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 10</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20271" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 169 CLR 271</a> at 277. </i><br><br><i>2.12	The
giving of an undertaking as to damages is the &#8220;ordinary price&#8221; that
the plaintiffs must be prepared to pay in
order to obtain interim relief by way
of injunction or appointment of receivers: Bond Brewing Holdings Limited v
National Australia

This has been the
practice since at least 1844: Bond Brewing at 574. In Meagher, Gummow and
Lehane, 3rd Ed, para 2181 the
following is said:</i><br><br><i>&#8220;Almost as
a matter of course, a Court will decline to grant an interlocutory injunction
unless the plaintiff undertakes to

.... The importance of an undertaking is immense, as in the absence of
an
undertaking a defendant who is ultimately victorious at the final hearing has no
recourse to recover the damages he may have incurred
from complying with an
interlocutory injunction ...&#8221;</i><br><br><i>2.13	The provision of the

ingredient of the application: Air

304. It is particularly apposite to refer to the comments of the Full Court in
Bond Brewing at 569:</i><br><br><i>&#8220;In any event, if any case for the
interim or interlocutory appointment of receivers and managers of the
undertakings and assets
was made out, the usual undertaking would have to be
exacted ... . The argument on the appeal has proceeded on the basis that the
respondents are not willing, in order to keep the receivers in possession, to
give an undertaking as to damages which will protect
the appellants against the
consequences of the orders of 29 December and 9 February. To preserve the
receivership without a satisfactory
undertaking as to damages is
unthinkable.&#8221;</i><br><br><i>2.14	The Applicants are unable to provide any
worthwhile undertaking for an application of this kind (T15.56-16.46). Even
where the
usual undertaking is offered, interlocutory relief will, absent the
exceptional circumstances, be refused if the undertaking is likely
to prove
ineffective, in particular because of a plaintiffs&#8217; lack of means. In
Donnelly v Amalgamated Television Services Pty
Limited &amp; Anor  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2045%20NSWLR%20570" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 45
NSWLR 570</a>, Hodgson CJ (in Eq) stated (at page 575):</i><br><br><i>&#8220;On the
balance of convenience, the fact that the plaintiff&#8217;s undertaking as to
damages is probably of little or no value
is a powerful discretionary factor
against the grant of an interlocutory injunction.&#8221;</i><br><br><i>2.15	The
plaintiffs assert that the High Court decision in Bond Brewing should be seen as
being limited to ex parte situations. That
is plainly incorrect. The Court said,
at page 275:</i><br><br><i>&#8220;... their Honours attached great importance to
the absence of an undertaking as to damages which they described as the
&#8216;usual
undertaking&#8217; to be required, clearly having in mind contested
applications as well as ex parte applications for the appointment
of receivers
and managers.&#8221;</i><br><br><i>The High Court did not disturb any of the
findings of the Full Court.</i><br><br><i>2.16	In the present case, it is
apparent that Mr Maconochie and Australian International Insurance stand behind
the Plaintiffs (see
EXD1); yet there is no evidence that they are prepared to
put their own assets at risk in securing the undertaking.
</i><br><br><i>2.17	The application is for a receiver in respect of the assets,
business and undertaking of NMG and other companies in the NMG Group.
NMG Group
is not defined. If the expression is meant to include all subsidiaries of NMG,
it would include Ausmaq NZ Limited, a company
incorporated in New Zealand, which
is not a party to either the proceedings or to this application. The assets are
not further defined.
It is clear from the powers sought in Schedule A that it is
intended that the Receiver is to have the power to carry on NMG&#8217;s
business
and defend the current proceedings on behalf of
NMG.</i><br><br><b>3.	Application for receiver to NAB (Para
2)</b><br><br><i>3.1	The application to appoint a receiver in relation to the
NAB relates to three different types of property:</i><br><i>(a)	shares held by
NAB or NAFM in NMG, Ausmaq Systems and other unidentified NMG companies (para
2.1);</i><br><i>(b)	such assets of NAB and NAFM and other NAB group companies as
comprise or are employed in or are used for the purposes of the various
NAB
projects (paras 2.2 and 2.3);</i><br><i>(c)	such assets of NAB and NAFM and
other NAB group companies as are reasonably required to fund the global
development of the Ausmaq
service </i><br><br><b><i>(a)	Receiver of shares held
by NAB or NAFM</i></b><br><br><i>3.2	No such relief is sought in the Summons.
There is just no basis whatsoever for any such relief.</i><br><br><i>3.3	The
shares in NMG were acquired by NAB before the Consulting Agreement (when NMG was
known as Valenti Pty Limited and was a shelf
company). NAB has held the shares
at all times since then. Pursuant to the Restructuring Agreement, NMG acquired
from Market Holdings
all the right title and interest in the System IP rights
and all the shares in Ausmaq System. The shares in NMG have never been the
subject of any dealings between the parties and there is no basis for the
Applicants interfering in the NAB&#8217;s control. It is
not contended in any
part of the pleading that the shares in NMG are property to which the plaintiffs
are entitled or in which they
have any interest.</i><br><br><i>3.4	Paragraph 58
of the 2nd FASOC seeks rescission of the Restructuring Agreement and the
Consulting Agreement. For the Applicants
to keep that claim alive while seeking
mandatory interlocutory relief in the nature of specific performance introduces
an Alice in
Wonderland element to the litigation.  The Applicants should be
required to elect.</i><br><br><br><b><i>(b)	Receiver of such assets as comprise
or are employed in or used for the purposes of Maple Leaf and the other NAB
projects</i></b><br><br><i>3.5	The assets which &#8220;comprise or are employed
in or used for the purposes&#8221; the projects or any of the other projects
are
not identified. The evidence of Mr Alan Copsey (affidavit sworn 16 July 1999)
is, in this regard:</i><br><br><i>(a)	that it is extremely difficult, if not
impossible, to isolate all of the assets which are, or will be used in the
projects (as
to Gateway, see paragraph 23; as to Margin Lending, see paragraph
50; and T43.25-35);</i><br><i>(b)	that two projects, namely Remote Wealth
Management Strategy Project, and Independence One Project, did not progress past
research
and high-level conceptualisation (as to Remote Wealth, see paragraph
31; as to Independence One, see paragraph 89).</i><br><br><i>3.6	JMG&#8217;s
claim in respect of the Bank projects is based upon a misreading of the terms of
the Consulting Agreement. The NAB
or its divisions cannot be an Operating Entity
because there is no evidence that it has the use of the Intellectual Property
used
to provide the service known as the Ausmaq Service. The evidence of Mr
Copsey is that the intellectual properly used in the Bank
projects was derived
from sources other than NMG (see paras 13, 40, 58 and
81).</i><br><br><i>3.7	Further, even if the Applicants&#8217; construction of
the Consulting Agreement is correct, there is no admissible evidence that
the
Ausmaq System is similar in functionality to the Bank
projects.</i><br><br><i>3.8	However, even if the Applicants&#8217; construction
of the Consulting Agreement were correct and even if the evidence in relation
to
similarity of function were admissible, there is no obligation on the NAB to
transfer such projects to NMG and no entitlement
on the part of NMG to obtain
such projects. The relevant provision is the obligation imposed upon NMG in the
Consulting Agreement
to make payments of Performance Bonus in respect of the
revenue of Operating Entities, which, on the Applicants&#8217; argument includes
any part of the NAB conducting a service similar to the Ausmaq Service. The
fact, (if it be the fact) that NMG has agreed to make
a payment to JMG in
respect of the revenue of &#8220;operating entities&#8221; does not entitle NMG
to ownership of those entities.</i><br><br><i>3.9	Further, there is simply no
evidence that assets comprised in the Bank projects are in any way at risk.
Indeed, such assets as
there are are being developed by the NAB. The fact of the
matter is that these projects have been brought into existence by the NAB;
it is
only through the NAB&#8217;s actions that they exist, whether or not they are
part of the Ausmaq service. If, which is disputed,
they are, there is no
evidence that the NAB has utilized any of the Ausmaq IP for the purpose of
creating or developing them.</i><br><br><i>3.10	The claim for relief is
nonsensical. The evidence from Mr Copsey shows that projects consist of software
licences, some confidential
information, some records of the concepts and
information and certain intellectual property (as to Gateway see paragraphs
12-13,
21-23; as to Margin Lending see 36-41, 47-50; as to FX Autodealing 54-60,
65-68; as to Maple Leaf see paragraphs 74-75, 82-84). Apart
from this, the four
projects still on foot depend upon the knowledge of employees of the NAB,
funding by the NAB and office equipment
belonging to the NAB (see paragraphs 21,
47, 65 and 82 of the affidavit of Mr Copsey). The plaintiffs have no entitlement
to orders
directing the NAB as to the manner of control of its own employees and
resources. In these circumstances, the only effect of appointing
a receiver over
the Bank projects (assuming that this is even possible) will be to lead to their
termination or degradation (see
for instance Copsey affidavit at paragraphs 24,
52, 71 and 84). One stark example is given in paragraph 70 of Mr Copsey&#8217;s
affidavit.
The appointment of a receiver to any assets of the NAB may result in
Cognotec Services Limited, the software vendor for the software
used in the FX
Dealing Project (as to which, see paragraph 58 of Mr Copsey&#8217;s affidavit)
terminating the software licence, which
would have the effect of shutting down
the project. It in such precise circumstances that the Court will not appoint a
receiver as
it will destroy the very property that the receiver would be
appointed to protect.</i><br><br><i>3.11	There is no evidence of misuse by the
NAB of NMG&#8217;s intellectual property.</i><br><br><i>3.12	The jurisdiction to
appoint a receiver and manager is for the purpose of protecting assets. Indeed
the relief sought is only
for the appointment of a receiver and manager pending
the determination of these proceedings. In other words, it is implicit that
if
NMG and the NAB succeed in the present litigation, NMG and the NAB should be
entitled to continue to conduct the business in the
way in which it has been
conducted to date. </i><br><br><i>3.13	Yet the material in support of the
application shows that what JMG in fact seeks are orders which require the
business to be
conducted as if JMG were entitled to ordain how it be conducted,
no matter what the cost to NMG and the NAB and no matter whether
Maconochie&#8217;s way of conducting the business is agreeable to the Bank.
</i><br><br><i>3.14	A key issue in the dispute between the parties is whether
the agreement between the parties requires NMG to proceed immediately
to develop
the Ausmaq Service throughout the world and provide whatever finances are
necessary to that end. There is evidence that
NMG made a decision not to develop
the business overseas until it had been commercialised in Australia and NZ
(EXDX1 at 380).  Whether
this decision was permissible under the Consulting
Agreement is a question for the final hearing.  Prima facie, however, the
decision
was permissible and not a breach of
contract.</i><br><br><b><i>(c)	Receiver of assets required to
fund</i></b><br><br><i>3.15	This claim has no basis. There is no express term of
the agreements which requires NAB to fund anything. There is no basis for
the
implication of such an extraordinary term. Even if there were, that would give
rise to a claim by JMG against NAB to damages.
This cannot ground the
appointment of a receiver.</i><br><br><i>3.16	Apart from these matters, there
are insuperable difficulties in making orders about unidentified assets alleged
to be necessary
to provide funding at an unidentified
level&#8217;.</i><br>	<br>	[Overview Submissions paragraphs
7-19]<br><br><b>Relevance of the Bank&#8217;s
Guarantee</b><br><br>36   	The defendants rely heavily on the
Bank&#8217;s Guarantee as a reason for rejecting the plaintiff&#8217;s claims to
interlocutory
relief.  The defendants&#8217; submission is
that:<br><br><i>&#8216;For so long as the Consulting Agreement remains on foot,
there is no doubt as to the entitlement of JMG to the monthly payment
under
clause 6.1. There is no valid complaint of non-payment. As to the performance
bonus (clause 7 and Schedule 2), the Guarantee
dated 6 November 1996 by NAB, in
favour of Idoport, of payment of any money due under that clause provides a
powerful reason for
rejecting any claim to interlocutory
relief&#8217;.</i><br>	<br>[Overview Submissions paragraph

to Funding</b><br><br>38   	The defendants&#8217; submission in
respect to so much of the interlocutory application as includes such an order is
as follows:<br><br><i>&#8216;The claim that there should be an interlocutory
mandatory injunction requiring NAB to fund the development of the AUSMAQ System
is hopelessly flawed. Presumably the Applicant seeks to sustain the claim by
reference to an implied contractual term of the Consulting
Agreement pleaded in
para 18.1 of 2nd FASOC:</i><br><br><i>&#8220;That NMG and NAB should take all
reasonable steps to enable the implementation and operation of the Consulting
Agreement, including
the provision of adequate finance ... to enable the
operation and commercialisation of the Ausmaq Systems and business throughout
Australia and globally.&#8221;</i><br><br><i>A simple answer to this contention
is that the only function of NAB under the Consulting Agreement is to provide a
guarantee: see
clause 7(h). It is neither implicit in the text of the Agreement
or necessary to instil business efficacy that NAB be under any obligation
of the
kind pleaded. As to NMG, the same factors preclude any implication of such a
term; also any implication is excluded by clause
10(3)(a) of the Consulting
Agreement (set out below). Why, one asks, would one imply it if that clause
removes any liability for
a supposed breach of it?&#8217;</i>	<br>	[Overview
Submissions paragraph 22]<br><br><b>Overview of the Approach to be taken
</b><br><br>39   	It is quite plain that the appointment of a
receiver is to be had only where the remedies which the applicant could obtain
from
a court of law are inadequate to meet the ends of justice, and insufficient
to confer upon him all the relief to which he is justly
entitled.  To my mind
the relevant principles are those which were expounded by the Victorian Full
Court in <i>Bond Brewing Holdings Ltd &amp; Ors v National Australia Bank Ltd

The Full Court said inter alia:<br><br><i>&#8216;True it is that in many cases
the appointment of a receiver will be sought by one who has a proprietary
interest.  But the
existence in the applicant of such an interest is not
essential to the existence of jurisdiction or power to appoint a receiver,
or to
a right exercise of the discretion to make an appointment if the matter is not
treated as one of jurisdiction or power.</i><br><br><i>The reason why the court
normally looks for something in the nature of an interest in the property is not
some principle of equity
whereby a receiver may be had only by someone who has
such an interest but a much wider principle, the principle that the appointment
of a receiver, or for that matter any peculiarly equitable remedy, is to be had
only where the remedies which the applicant could
obtain from a court of law are
inadequate to meet the ends of justice, insufficient to confer upon him the
relief to which he is
justly entitled.  We refer to Pomeroy&#8217;s Equity
Jurisprudence, 5th Ed, Vol 1, paras 136-222.  On Pomeroy&#8217;s analysis,
unlike
that of some other writers, the exclusive jurisdiction of equity includes
cases in which the remedy to be granted is purely equitable
in the sense that it
is recognised and administered by courts of equity and not by courts of law. 
See para 138.  It is Pomeroy&#8217;s
thesis that while the inadequacy of legal
remedies is the foundation of the concurrent jurisdiction it is only the
occasion for the
rightful exercise of the exclusive jurisdiction.  See paras
216-222.  According to Pomeroy, since the exclusive equitable jurisdiction,
as
far as presently relevant, exists because the remedies invoked are such as are
administered by courts of equity alone, it is wrong
to treat the inadequacy of
legal remedies as the foundation of the exclusive jurisdiction.  The
jurisdiction, and so the power of
the tribunal to adjudicate, exists, and what
is affected by the question of the adequacy of legal remedies is the due and
proper
exercise of the jurisdiction or power.  The proper exercise of the
jurisdiction - but not the jurisdiction itself - depends upon
whether the legal
remedies may be inadequate to meet the ends of justice.  This seems to us to be
the correct view.  The actual power
or jurisdiction of a court of equity to
grant a receiver depends simply upon its jurisdiction over the person of the
defendant, just
as its power or jurisdiction to grant an injunction
does.</i><br><br><i>Now in the ordinary case of a simple debt the
creditor&#8217;s remedy at law is regarded as adequate.  Compare Pusey &amp;
Jones Co
v Hanssen <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1923/96.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1923] USSC 96</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=261%20US%20491" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">261 US 491</a> at 497.  But if he has a right to be paid out of a
fund, then, if his legal remedies are not adequate to protect that right, equity
may be prepared to appoint a receiver: Kearns v Leaf <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1864/185.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1864] EngR 185</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281864%29%201%20H%20%26%20M%20681" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1864) 1 H &amp; M 681</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=71%20ER%20299" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">71

be viewed rather as a case of &#8220;equitable
execution&#8221;.</i><br><br><i>The court will not interfere by injunction
unless its remedy is superior to the remedy which may be had at law:
Attorney-General v
Sheffield Gas Consumers Co  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281852%29%203%20D%20M%20%26%20G%20304" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1852) 3 D M &amp; G 304</a> at 319;

adequate remedy, so he will not obtain a receiver if some common
law remedy is
adequate&#8221;.</i><br><br>40   	Hence one approaches the
application for the appointment of a receiver on the basis that such appointment
is to be had only
where the remedies obtainable at law are inadequate to meet
the ends of justice.  The inadequacy of legal remedies is a condition
for the
proper exercise of equitable jurisdiction rather than the foundation of the
jurisdiction itself.<br><br>41   	Further, there is no principle
that a receiver may be appointed only on the application of a person who asserts
some proprietary
interest in the property concerned.  What the applicants before
this Court must show is that it has some legal or equitable right
which will be
protected or enforced by the making of the orders sought and that no other
available remedy is adequate for that
purpose.<br><br>42   	However, as was also pointed out by the
Full Court in <i>Bond Brewing </i>the power to appoint a receiver
is:<br><br><i>&#8216;a drastic, harsh and dangerous one and should be exercised
with care and caution ... receivership is a drastic course allowed
only under
pressing circumstances and granted only with reluctance and caution ... the
appointment of a receiver is an extraordinary
and drastic remedy, to be
exercised with utmost care and caution and only where the court is satisfied
that there is imminent danger
of loss if it is not
exercised&#8217;.</i><br>	<br>	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1991/31.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] VicRp 31</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20ACSR%20445" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1 ACSR 445</a> at 458 followed in <i>Global Funds v

ultimate relief being necessarily uncertain at an interlocutory stage, the
Court, in deciding

what course is best calculated to achieve justice between the parties

bearing in mind the consequences to the defendant
of the grant of an injunction

not appropriate for the court to decide

extent removed&#8217;.</i><br><br>(<i>Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining
NL</i> (1987) 8 NSWLR at 535 per Mc Lelland J)<br><br>46   	It is
of course common ground that unless a plaintiff shows that there is at least a
serious question to be tried which if resolved
in its favour would entitle it to
final relief, then the requirements of justice as between the parties will
dictate that an interlocutory
injunction should be
refused.<br><br>47   	There are certain classes of cases where
the evaluation of the strength of the plaintiff&#8217;s case for final relief is
clearly
desirable.<br><br>48   	In <i>Kolback Securities

refuse an interlocutory injunction would in a practical sense
determine the
substance of the matter in issue.  In that case his Honour
said:<br><br><i>&#8216; ... normally the court &#8220;does not undertake a

case in which it
appears to the Court to be just or convenient so to
do.<br>51   	As McLelland J made plain at page 216 citing from
the judgment of Moffitt P in <i>Stollznow v Calvert</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%202%20NSWLR%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 2 NSWLR

with applications for interlocutory injunctions:<br><br><i>&#8216;The Court
addresses itself in all cases, patent as well as other, to two main enquiries. 
The first is whether the plaintiff
has made out a prima facie case, in the sense
that if the evidence remains as it is, there is a probability that at the trial
of
the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief...the second
enquiry...is whether the inconvenience or injury which the
plaintiff would be
likely to suffer if an injunction were refused, outweighs or is outweighed by,
the injury which the defendant
would suffer if an injunction were
granted&#8217;.</i><br><br>53   	At page 214 McLelland J further
referred to <i>Shercliff v Engadine Acceptance Corporation Pty Ltd</i><b>
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%201%20NSWLR%20729" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 1 NSWLR 729</a> at 736, 737, where the Court of Appeal explained the
special sense in which the expression "probability" was used by the High Court
in the <i>Beecham</i> case, and in particular had said that it did not refer
either to a prediction as to the ultimate result or to a better than even
chance
of ultimate success.  The Court said that:<br><br><i>&#8216;The degree of
probability or likelihood of success is simply that which the Court thinks
sufficient, in the particular case,
to warrant preservation of the status
quo&#8217;.</i><br><br>54   	As McLelland J reminds us at page
214, the Court had already stated that in that case the balance of convenience
was very strongly
in favour of the granting of interlocutory relief (to preserve
the status quo), and accordingly the Court's statement, McLelland
J believed,
might be generalised by saying:<br><br><i>&#8216; . . that the degree of
likelihood of success to be demonstrated is that which the Court thinks
sufficient in the particular
case to warrant consideration of where the balance
of convenience lies&#8217;.</i><br><br>55   	McLelland J also
cited from the Privy Council decision in <i>Eng Mee Yong v Letchumanan</i><b>
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20AC%20331" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] AC 331</a> at 337 where the Privy Council had expressed the relevant
principle in terms derived from the American <i>Cyanamide</i><b> </b>case as
follows:<br><br><i>&#8216;The Court's power to grant an interlocutory
injunction...is discretionary.  It may be granted in all cases in which it
appears
to the Court to be just and convenient to do so...the guiding principle
in granting an interlocutory injunction is the balance of
convenience; there is
no requirement that before an interlocutory injunction is granted the plaintiff
should satisfy the Court that
there is a `probability', a `prima facie case' or
a `strong prima facie case' that if the action goes to trial he will succeed;
but
before any question of balance of convenience can arise the party seeking
the injunction must satisfy the Court that his claim is
neither frivolous nor
vexatious; in other words that the evidence before the Court discloses that
there is a serious question to
be
tried...&#8217;.</i><br><br>56   	McLelland J at page 215
expressed the view that what was said in the <i>Eng Mee Yong</i> case is not
inconsistent in substance with what is said in the <i>Shercliffe</i><b> </b>case
notwithstanding that the form of words used in the two cases is different, and
in the <i>Eng Mee Yong</i> case, the expressions "probability" and "prima facie
case" seem to be used in somewhat different senses to those in which the same
expressions are used in the <i>Beecham</i> case as explained in the
<i>Shercliffe</i> case.  McLelland J pointed out that it must be remembered
that:<br><br><i>&#8216;No Court should consider itself fettered by the form of
words as if it were a phrase in an Act of Parliament which must be
accepted and
construed as it stands&#8217;.</i><br><br>57   	McLelland J
further noted that in considering the question of the "balance of convenience"
as contemplated in the <i>Eng Mee Yong</i><b> </b>case and the American
<i>Cyanamide</i><b> </b>case, the relative apparent strength of each party's
case may be a relevant matter.  As McLelland J pointed out this accords with
what the Supreme Court of Victoria said <i>Magna Alloys and Research Pty Ltd v
Coffey</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1981/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] VicRp 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1981%20VR%2023" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1981 VR 23</a> in the following passage relating to the High Court's
judgment in the <i>Beecham Group</i> case:<br><br><i>&#8216;Having regard to the
fact that the High Court cited the judgment of James LJ in Plimpton v Schiller
with approval, the reference
in Beecham's case...to a probability of success
should not be understood as meaning that the plaintiff must show that at trial
it
is more probable than not that he will succeed.  Indeed the High Court made
it clear that that is not the issue for the judge to
determine, for, in the
passage already cited the Court said `...the Court does not...give or withhold
interlocutory relief upon a
forecast as to the ultimate result of the
case&#8217;.</i><br><br>58   	Rather the High Court should be
understood as referring to the degree of probability which may be high or low. 
No doubt the
strength or weakness of the plaintiff's case will be relevant when
the judge comes to the question of the balance of convenience,
if he ever
does."<br>59   	At page 216 McLelland J cited Lord Diplock's
judgment in American <i>Cyanamide</i> in terms of the power to grant
interlocutory injunctions.  The passage was as follows:<br><br><i>&#8216;My
Lords, when an application for an interlocutory injunction to restrain a
defendant from doing acts alleged to be in violation
of the plaintiff's legal
right is made upon contested facts, the decision whether or not to grant an
interlocutory injunction has
to be taken at a time when ex hypothesi the
existence of the right or the violation of it, or both, is uncertain and will
remain
uncertain until final judgment is given in the action.  It was to
mitigate the risk of injustice to the plaintiff during the period
before that
uncertainty could be resolved that the practice arose of granting him relief by
way of interlocutory injunction; but
since the middle of the nineteenth century
this has been made subject to his undertaking to pay damages to the defendant
for any
loss sustained by reason of the injunction if it should be held at the
trial that the plaintiff had not been entitled to restrain
the defendant from
doing what he was threatening to do.  The object of the interlocutory injunction
is <u>to protect the plaintiff against injury by violation of his right for
which he could not be adequately compensated in damages recoverable
in the
action if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial; but the
plaintiff's need for such protection must be weighed
against the corresponding
need of the defendant to be protected against injury resulting from his having
been prevented from exercising
his own legal rights for which he could not be
adequately compensated under the plaintiff's undertaking in damages if the
uncertainty
were resolved in the defendant's favour at the
trial&#8217;</u>.</i><br>[Emphasis added]<br><br>60   	At page
216, McLelland J pointed out that it is the task of the Court on an application
for an interlocutory injunction to seek
to fulfil this purpose in the manner
best calculated to achieve justice between the parties in the circumstances of
the particular
case.  McLelland J pointed out that with possible exception of a
passage in the <i>Beecham Group</i> case which deals with what are said to be
special considerations arising in a patent suit in which there is a substantial
issue as
to the validity of the patent, which McLelland J then proceeded to
consider:<br><br><i>&#8216;. . . the decisions to which I have already referred
provide authoritative guidance (not however to be interpreted as `rigid
formulae') as to how this task of the Court should normally be approached, but
do not deny the proposition that the ultimate task
of the Court is as I have
described it&#8217;.</i><br><br><br>61   	I have endeavoured to
approach the present application for interlocutory relief applying the
principles as expressed by McLelland
J.  The matter is put shortly by Meagher,
Gummow &amp; Lehane, <i>Equity Doctrines and Remedies</i>, 2nd Edition at para
2168.<br><br><i>&#8216;What the plaintiff must prove is that he has a serious,
not a speculative, case which has a real possibility of ultimate success
and
that he has property or other interests which might be jeopardised if no
interlocutory relief were granted.  Then it becomes
a matter of seeing if, in
all the circumstances of the case, the Court should nonetheless exercise its
discretion by declining to
issue an interlocutory
injunction&#8217;.</i><br><br>62   	Likewise in Meagher, Gummow
and Lehane at paragraph 217 the learned authors say:<br><br><i>&#8216;What is
meant by saying that the Court must take into account the balance of convenience
and the question of hardship is that
it must consider carefully what effects the
granting of an injunction will have on both parties and in particular whether to
grant
one would cause hardship to the defendant or to refuse one would cause
hardship to the plaintiff&#8217;.</i><br><br>63   	Bearing in
mind the significance on the motion of questions going to matters said to
involve the concept of &#8220;constant
supervision by a court&#8221; of specific
performance orders, it is convenient to refer to two recent decisions, one of
the House
of Lords, and one of the High Court.<br><br>64   	In

Sir John Pennycuick V-C refused to order the corporation to maintain an airfield
as a going concern because: &#8220;It is very well
established that the court
will not order specific performance of an obligation to carry on a
business&#8221;: see p 211.  He added:
&#8220;It is unnecessary in the
circumstances to discuss whether damages would be an adequate remedy to the
company&#8221;: see p
212.  Thus the reasons which underlie the established
practice may justify a refusal of specific performance even when damages are
not
an adequate remedy.</i><br><br><i>The most frequent reason given in the cases
for declining to order someone to carry on a business is that it would require
constant
supervision by the court.  In J C Williamson Ltd v Lukey and Mulholland
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1931/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1931] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281931%29%2045%20CLR%20282" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1931) 45 CLR 282</a>, 297-8, Dixon J said flatly: &#8220;Specific performance is
inapplicable when the continued supervision of the court is necessary
in order
to ensure the fulfilment of the contract&#8221;.</i><br><br><i>There has, I
think, been some misunderstanding about what is meant by continued
superintendence.  It may at first sight suggest that
the judge (or some other
office of the court) would literally have to supervise the execution of the
order.  In C H Giles &amp; Co
Ltd v Morris  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%201%20WLR%20307" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] 1 WLR 307</a>, 318 Megarry J said
that &#8220;difficulties of constant superintendence&#8221; were a &#8220;narrow
consideration&#8221; because:</i><br><br><i>&#8220;there is normally no question
of the court having to send its officers to supervise the performance of the
order ... Performance
... is normally secured by the realisation of the person
enjoined that he is liable to be punished for contempt if evidence of his
disobedience to the order is put before the court; ...&#8221;</i><br><br><i>This
is, of course, true but does not really meet the point.  The Judges who have
said that the need for constant supervision was
an objection to such orders were
no doubt well aware that supervision would in practice take the form of rulings
by the court, on
applications made by the parties, as to whether there had been
a breach of the order.  It is the possibility of the court having
to give an
indefinite series of such rulings in order to ensure the execution of the order
which has been regarded as undesirable.</i><br><br><i>Why should this be so?  A
principal reason is that, as Megarry J pointed out in the passage to which I
have referred, the only means
available to the court to enforce its order is the
quasi-criminal procedure of punishment for contempt.  This is a powerful weapon;
so powerful, in fact, as often to be unsuitable as an instrument for
adjudicating upon the disputes which may arise over whether
a business is being
run in accordance with the terms of the court&#8217;s order.  The heavy-handed
nature of the enforcement mechanism
is a consideration which may go to the
exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion in other cases as well, but its use to
compel the
running of a business is perhaps the paradigm case of its
disadvantages and it is in this context that I shall discuss
them&#8221;.</i><br><br>65   	The decision in <i>Argyll Stores
</i>was dealt with by the High Court in <i>Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2
Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia [No 3] </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/30.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 30</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2072%20ALJR%20873" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 72 ALJR 873</a> in the
following terms:<br><br><i>&#8216;We see in the orders no defect which sometimes
is expressed as the involvement of the court in &#8220;constant
supervision&#8221;
of continued conduct.  Reservations of that nature have been
expressed in decisions of this Court.  <u>However questions of degree rather
than absolute restrictions</u> upon the scope of curial relief are involved. 
Reference was made in the Federal Court judgments and in submissions to this
Court
to the speech of Lord Hoffmann in Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd v
Argyll Stores (Holdings) Ltd.  His Lordship affirmed the refusal
by the judge at
first instance of an order for specific performance of a lease for a term of 35
years containing a covenant to keep
premises open for retail trade during usual
hours of business in the locality.  His Lordship&#8217;s statement that the
usual practice
was not to grant specific performance to carry on an activity
over a period of time was made in response to a submission by the lessor
to the
effect that the equitable remedy was no longer to be understood as granted in
the auxiliary jurisdiction where damages would
be an inadequate remedy.  The
lessor submitted, without success, that in cases such as Argyll Stores the court
&#8220;should look
at the whole panoply of available remedies and consider
<u>the appropriate one</u> rather than the gloss of rules put on them
restricting their use&#8221;.</i><br><br><i>The House of Lords discharged the
order for specific performance which the Court of Appeal had made.  The
significance of Lord Hoffmann&#8217;s
speech for present purposes is not the
rejection of the lessor&#8217;s submissions.  That rejection, with respect, was
virtually
inevitable.  What is significant is the acceptance by the House of
Lords that the concept of &#8220;constant supervision by the court&#8221;
by
itself is no longer an effective or useful criterion for refusing a decree of
specific performance.  Rather, Lord Hoffmann placed
stress on other
propositions.  <u>First, a person who is subject to a mandatory order attended
by contempt sanction (which &#8220;must realistically be seen as criminal
in
nature&#8221;) ought to know with precision what is required; and, second, the
possibility of &#8220;repeated applications for
rulings on compliance&#8221;
with orders requiring a party &#8220;to carry on an activity, such as running a
business over a more
or less extended period of time&#8221; should be
discouraged&#8217;</u>.</i><br><br>[per Brennan CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and
Hayne JJ<br>at 893]	   [emphasis added]<br><i> </i><br><b>The
Facts</b><br><br>66   	It is inappropriate on an interlocutory
application such as the present to detail the facts in the same fashion as
occurs in
handing down a final judgment.  The documentary tender in the present
case, albeit that the motion is an interlocutory motion, extended
to well in
excess of 5,000 pages.  This was principally because the plaintiffs sought to
place into evidence all of the materials
presently filed by the plaintiffs as
their evidence to be deployed in the final hearing.  The extensive statements
also relied upon
by the plaintiffs in the interlocutory motion in very large
part went to the so-called &#8220;serious question to be tried&#8221;
or
&#8220;real question&#8221; issues.  The statements also dealt at length with
balance of convenience issues.  The interlocutory
application occupied nine
hearing days.<br><br>67   	The defendants for their part sought
to put into evidence principally matters going to balance of convenience and
only briefly
evidence said to be sufficient to enable the Court to discern that
in relation to many of the factual allegations pressed by the
plaintiffs, there
was a real dispute which would require to be ultimately determined at the final
hearing.  The defendants not only
placed &#8220;serious question to be
tried&#8221; in issue but as already noted, asserted that &#8220;the correct
evaluation of the
claims to interlocutory relief require more than just an
assessment of whether there is a serious question to be tried as to their
validity.  This is because the grant of the relief sought would displace
proprietary rights clearly vested in NMG&#8221;. [Overview

4]<br><br>68   	Not all of the materials to which the Court was
taken on the hearing of the interlocutory motion will be referred to hereunder.

Here again, a brief overview of the facts, which were in some cases agreed and
in other cases the subject of dispute, suffices for
the purposes of the motion. 
The following outline is broadly taken to represent the plaintiffs&#8217; case.
<br><br><b>15 August 1996</b><br><br>69   	An unsigned set of
draft heads of agreement entered into between the Bank, AUSMAQ Limited, Mr
Walker, NMG, JMG, Mr Maconochie
and Investors Buying Service (IBS) Pty Limited
was sought to be relied upon by the plaintiffs - PX 3/1195.<br><br><b>20 August
1996</b><br><br>70   	A later draft of heads of agreement this
time expressed to be between the Bank, AUSMAC Limited and Mr Walker was sought
to be
relied upon by the plaintiffs and tendered as PX4/1220 and following. 
This draft was also unsigned.  Both this and the previous
15 August 1996 draft
included the sentence &#8220;The parties agree that this heads of agreement is
not intended to be legally binding&#8221;
- cl 1.<br><br><b>13 September
1996</b><br><br>71   	The restructuring and consulting agreements
were entered into on this date together with several ancillary
agreements.<br><br><b>18 October 1996</b><br><br>72   	On 18
October 1996 JMG entered into a number of consultancy service agreements with
nominated consultants, namely Mr Maconochie,
a company Graspnovel Limited
associated with Mr Hume, a company Chipland Pty Limited associated with Mr
Nelson, and Future Software
Pty Limited, a company associated with Mr B Martin.
[PX 1498, 1508, 1528 and 1542].  The agreements were generally for a term of
5
years and obliged the consultant to the best of his or its ability to provide
identified services relating to the use of computers
and communications in
support of the AUSMAQ service and by way of the development modification and
maintenance of software in connection
with the service, by way of preparation of
business plans and such other services as may be directed in accordance with the
agreement.
 Subject to regulation by cl 4 of the agreement, the consultants
agreed to devote and procure that nominated personnel devote so
much time to the
services as may be necessary up to full time, for the proper performance of the
services, and to give priority and
procure that nominated personnel give
priority to the provision of services to the business.  The business was
described as &#8220;the
commercial and practical operations of the Company,
[NMG] or its subsidiaries relating to the AUSMAQ service&#8221;.  The
consultancy
service agreements were expressly cross-referenced to the 18 October
1996 Consultancy Agreement between JMG and NMG.  The Consultancy
Agreement
included a covenant [clause 3.1] that &#8220;JMG will devote and will procure
that the Consultants [in turn defined to
mean Messrs J M Maconochie, C Hume, G
Nelson and B Mackin or any of them] devote so much time to the Services on a
full time basis
for the proper performance of the Services and will give
exclusive priority and procure  that the Consultants give exclusive priority
to
the provisions of the Services to the Group&#8221;.<br><br><b>6 November
1996</b><br><br>73   	On 6 November 1996 the Bank guarantee, to
which reference has already been made, was entered into between the Bank and
JMG.
 The agreement is appended to this judgment as Appendix &#8220;B&#8221;. 
It is an important document to be read as part of the reasons
for
judgment.<br><br>74   	6 November 1996 is also of significance in
that, as the parties accepted, it was the date on which completion occurred
under
the Restructuring Agreement - see the definition of &#8220;completion
date&#8221; in the Restructuring Agreement and in the Consultancy
Agreement.  In
consequence, as and from 6 November 1996 the Consultancy Agreement commenced to
bind the parties - [Consultancy Agreement
clause 2 and see also the conditions
precedent in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2</a> of the Restructuring
Agreement].<br><br>75   	A number of ancillary agreements listed
in paragraph 15.7 of Mr Maconochie&#8217;s first statement were also entered
into on
6 November 1996.<br><br><b>Events Following 6 November
1996</b><br><br>76   	The relevant financial year was at all
material times the 12 month period ending upon 30 September.  It will be
immediately
appreciated that as the parties were bound to the terms of the
Consultancy Agreement on and after 6 November 1996, it would not have
been
possible for the parties pursuant to cl 4.1(a) of the Consultancy Agreement to
agree upon a business plan for the 1996/97 year
on an earlier date.  In
consequence clause 4.1 (a) and 4.1 (b) detailed  a different regime to be
observed with respect to the provision
at least for so much of the first
business year, as would deal with the period between 6 November 1996 and 30
September 1997.  Mr
Maconochie&#8217;s statements and a deal of the
correspondence was directed to the allegation that JMG&#8217;s nominated
representatives
had not been given an opportunity to meet with the NMG
management committee prior to the end of relevant financial years to review
the
objectives of the group, so as then to be in a position to prepare and later
deliver to NMG, a draft of the proposed business
plan for the immediately
following financial year - see cl 4.1(a) and (b) Consultancy
Agreement.<br><br>77   	Mr Maconochie in his first statement
asserts that in early October 1996 Mr Breeze, the Bank&#8217;s Group General
Manager assisting
the Managing Director, advised him that he would be appointing
Mr Krasnostein to the Board of NMG, he being the Bank&#8217;s new
Group Legal
Counsel.  Mr Maconochie also asserts that Mr Breeze in early November advised
him that Mr Peter Crutchley had been appointed
to the post of Chief Operating
Officer.  According to Mr Maconochie Mr Breeze advised him that Mr Maconochie
was the head of JMG
and consultant to AUSMAQ.<br><br>78   	In
paragraph 20 of his first statement Mr Maconochie asserts that on 19 November
1996 he attended a meeting of the Board of
Directors of AUSMAQ Systems, at which
meeting the directors received a slide presentation from Mr Moore prepared by Mr
Moore for
the AUSMAQ Systems&#8217; Board.  The presentation is said to have
included the Bank&#8217;s Objectives and Strategy, the Bank&#8217;s
approach to
AUSMAQ, the NMG organisational structure within the Bank group, and the Bank/JMG
balance of interests.<br><br>79   	In paragraph 21 of his first
statement Mr Maconochie gives evidence that in December 1996 and January 1997 he
prepared the 1997
Business Plan for AUSMAQ Systems and AUSMAQ (NZ) Limited
&#8220;in accordance with the terms of the Consulting Agreement&#8221;.
 He
gives evidence that he then submitted the plan to NMG and to AUSMAQ Systems on
16 December 1996.<br><br>80   	In paragraph 22 of his first
statement Mr Maconochie gives evidence that the draft Business Plan was tabled
at a meeting of
directors of AUSMAQ Systems on 17 December 1996 which he
attended.  The minutes of that meeting [PX 2062] record that the Business
Plan
was tabled at the meeting.  The directors, as the minutes record, resolved that
the business plan be sent to the Bank&#8217;s
group strategic development area
for their review and comment.<br><br>81   	At the same meeting
the directors, on Mr Maconochie&#8217;s evidence, were informed by the company
secretary that NMG intended
to appoint Messrs Courtney, McKimm and Krasnostein
as directors and that the Board confirmed the appointment of Mr Crutchley as
Chief
Operating Officer of AUSMAQ Systems.<br><br>82   	On 16
December 1996, as PX 2039-2042 records, a memorandum was sent by Mr Crutchley to
the Directors of Systems, dealing with
an executive summary of the business
plan.  The business plan is itself set out at PX 5/1917 running to PX 5/2029. 
It appears to
be a comprehensive and detailed Business
Plan.<br><br>83   	By memorandum dated 27 December 1996 Mr
Crutchley forwarded to the executive committee, a note seeking the
committee&#8217;s
approval to implement the business plan in scenario two for
Australia and to proceed with the establishment of the business in New
Zealand. 
[PX 5/2030]<br><br>84   	By memorandum dated 3 March 1997 Mr
Breeze notified Mr Crutchley of AUSMAQ Limited in broad terms of the
Bank&#8217;s approval
to the Business Plan.  The memorandum advised inter
alia:<br><br><i>&#8216;With a majority of the formalities out of the way the
scene is now set for AUSMAQ to proceed forward.  The Business Plan submitted
has
some significant challenges in the next seven months and also presents AUSMAQ
with opportunities to gain value from the use of
Group
resources&#8217;.</i><br><br>85   	In Mr Maconochie&#8217;s first
statement he refers to AUSMAQ System&#8217;s meetings which he attended on 18
February 1997 and
on 18 March 1997 and to the Board papers for these meetings
which he received before the meetings.  His evidence in paragraph 25.3
is that
the subject of Business Plans was not on the agenda of either of these meetings
and that according to the minutes of the
meetings that subject was not
raised.<br><br>86   	Mr Maconochie also refers to his attendance
at subsequent meetings of directors of NMG of AUSMAQ Systems and AUSMAQ (NZ)
Limited
in April, May, June and July 1997.  His evidence is that the 15 July
1997 meeting was the last such meeting which he attended and
that his attendance
at the April and June meetings was by video link from Sydney.  Mr Hume he says,
also attended the May and July
meetings.<br><br>87   	Mr
Maconochie&#8217;s evidence in paragraph 26.2 of his first statement is that at
these meetings the subject of Business Plans
and the performance overall of
AUSMAQ Systems and AUSMAQ (NZ) Limited was never raised once nor
discussed.<br><br>88   	During these proceedings the
plaintiffs&#8217; counsel indicated that the commencement of the arms length
position taken as
between the parties appears to have been in about mid-June
1997.  In Mr Maconochie&#8217;s first statement he gives evidence that
on 16
June 1997 he attended a meeting with Mr Crutchley and Mr Meikle at AUSMAQ
Systems&#8217; premises in Sydney at which Mr Maconochie
alluded to having heard
from Mr Meikle that it was thought that Mr Maconochie might sue the Bank.  In
the course of this conversation,
on Mr Maconochie&#8217;s version, he said that
JMG&#8217;s sole interest was to make the business work properly and that there
should
be nothing holding them back in this regard, and Mr Meikle said
&#8220;the enemy&#8217;s out there not in here, we have to work
together&#8221;.<br><br>89   	Mr Maconochie then, on his
evidence, furnished at the meeting a copy of what he described as a completed
AUSMAQ Strategic Plan
saying that he was forwarding it to NMG that day and
seeking comments on it in due course.  The subject strategic plan is to be found
at 6/2420-2444.<br><br>90   	Mr Maconochie gives evidence that at
this meeting of 16 June 1997 he told Mr Crutchley that the approved Business
Plan was not
being implemented, that the Board of AUSMAQ had no latitude in the
matter, and that Mr Crutchley was obliged to enable JMG to undertake
its role
and fulfil its contractual obligations.<br><br>91   	On Mr
Maconochie&#8217;s evidence he stated:<br><br><i>&#8216;There have been no NMG
management committee meetings.  I don&#8217;t even know who is on the NMG
management committee.  We
need to convene it to discuss the strategy document
prepared by JMG.  Otherwise JMG can&#8217;t meet its contractual requirements
to
produce the next Business Plan ... I don&#8217;t want to be waving our contract
in your face, but the NMG management committee
is an essential requirement of
our contract.  You cannot unilaterally do as you like, for example, withdrawing
the sales people from
the field.  That is not your prerogative nor is it the
prerogative of the AUSMAQ Board.  They must implement the Business Plan
delivered
to them by NMG and you must do your part.  Things must be better
co-ordinated and run in accordance with our
agreement&#8221;.</i><br><br>92   	In Mr Maconochie&#8217;s first
statement he gives evidence that on 17 June 1997 he telephoned Mr Breeze
advising Mr Breeze that
the company was badly off track and that JMG would be
proposing immediately firm and decisive action to rectify the situation.  On
his
evidence he said that he was concerned about the organisational structure of the
company and the situation with the Premium and
with NAFM.  He told Mr Breeze
that no NMG Management Committee Meetings had been held yet.  He said &#8220;I
don&#8217;t even know
who&#8217;s on it&#8221;.<br><br>93   	At a
meeting at AUSMAQ Systems&#8217; premises in Sydney on 19 June 1997 attended by
Mr Maconochie, Mr Crutchley and Mr Meikle,
Mr Maconochie tabled a paper entitled
&#8220;AUSMAQ Functional Structure, Management Operations and Reporting Division
and JMG/War
Room&#8221;. [PX vol 6 pp 2449-2455]<br><br>94   	Mr
Maconochie&#8217;s first statement includes evidence that he prepared a paper
dated 11 July 1997 entitled &#8220;Performance
Review of COO&#8221; [PX
7/2572-2580], a copy of which was given to Mr Hume. 
<br><br>95   	Mr Maconochie&#8217;s evidence was that on 14 July
1997 he held a meeting with Messrs Breeze and Krasnostein of NMG at the Park
Hyatt Hotel.  Messrs Hume and Nelson were also in attendance.
<br><br>96   	On Mr Maconochie&#8217;s evidence, upon his arrival
at the meeting with Mr Krasnostein, and even before sitting down, Mr Breeze
said:<br><br><i>&#8216;We are happy to come to your meeting and listen, but we
won&#8217;t be deciding anything here today.  You should deal with
Peter
Crutchley who is the authorised
officer&#8217;.</i><br><br>97   	On Mr Maconochie&#8217;s
evidence Mr Breeze then produced a letter and handed it across the table to him.
[PX7/2571]  The letter
addressed to Idoport to the attention of Mr Maconochie
was in the following terms:<br><br><i>&#8216;I confirm that until further notice
Peter Crutchley is an Authorised Officer (within the meaning of paragraph 3.2 of
the Consulting
Agreement) of National Markets Group Limited (the company) and
that he is authorised to give instructions to Idoport Pty Limited
(JMG) under
the terms of the Consulting Agreement.</i><br><br><i>Until further notice the
management committee of National Market Group Limited will comprise Mr Peter
Crutchley, Chairman and Roger
Meikle.  Mr Simon Moore and/or Mr Rod Carr may
attend those meetings ex officio.</i><br><br><i>Would you please make
arrangements with this committee to review the company&#8217;s objectives and
Business Plan for 1997/98.  I
would hope that you personally will be available
to attend these discussions together with one of your
consultants.</i><br><br><i>I look forward to our meeting on 4 July
1997&#8217;.</i><br><br>98   	Mr Maconochie gives evidence in his
first statement that after he had read the letter and given it to Mr Hume to
read what occurred
was as follows.  Mr Maconochie said:<br><br><i>&#8216;You are
the head of business for NMG.  We have always taken it that you, as head of
business, for NMG, were the Authorised
Officer  ... I am glad to see that the
NMG Management Committee has now been set up even though you have nominated
Crutchley to it
which might be a problem for all of us and we want to talk about
that.  It is now eight months since completion and the Committee
hasn&#8217;t
met.  The Consulting Agreement requires that we should have met at least by the
end of June to review the objectives
of the Group throughout the world, and we
are now well overdue for that meeting.  JMG is obliged to produce a draft
Business Plan
in about two weeks&#8217;
time&#8217;.</i><br><br>99   	After that Mr Breeze
said:<br><br><i>&#8216;We have let you attend the Board meetings.  They have
been in place of the Management
Committee&#8217;.</i><br><br>100   	Mr Maconochie
said:<br><br><i>&#8216;Thank you for that, but it appears to us that the NMG
Board meetings don&#8217;t address any of the substantive issues concerning
the
company that one might expect.  For example one of our agenda items today is the
AUSMAQ Strategic Plan that we submitted to you
on 16 June before the last NMG
Board Meeting.  NMG hasn&#8217;t even acknowledged its receipt yet, let alone
discussed it.  We were
hoping to review it with you today.  This has to be
settled before we can go ahead and produce the Business Plan which JMG has to
complete in draft at the end of the
month&#8217;.</i><br><br>101   	On Mr Maconochie&#8217;s
evidence, during the luncheon section of the meeting which then took place, he
said inter alia:<br><br><i>&#8216;We are serious about JMG undertaking the role
for JMG that was agreed.  JMG has a lot invested in this business and we need
to
see NMG operated as agreed to realise its huge potential.  That was the basis
that we transferred NMG the IP from Market Holdings.
 I want you to know we are
playing for keeps here&#8217;.</i><br><br>102   	According to Mr
Maconochie, when he and Mr Krasnostein went to the wash room, Mr Krasnostein
said to him:<br><br><i>&#8216;The Bank is very powerful and has a lot of
money&#8217;.</i><br><br>103   	On Mr Maconochie&#8217;s
evidence, after the luncheon at the meeting, Mr Hume said that Mr Crutchley had
neither the experience,
competence, course, skill, set, aptitude, nor presence
for a senior management role in the AUSMAQ Group.  Mr Hume said that Mr
Crutchley
had significantly damaged the AUSMAQ Group and the Bank&#8217;s
investment since his arrival.  He said:<br><br><i>&#8216;The waste of time,
energy and resources he has imposed on the business has been grievous.  In the
absence of JMG Consultants
being on hand to keep an eye on him and take
corrective action if they find out in the time, the Bank&#8217;s investment
would be
seriously compromised.  His performance has demonstrated that there is
no executive role, or indeed any position in the company at
all, that he is
qualified to fill.  Our advice to you is that the company cannot be
commercialised while he is present at the company.
 We therefore recommend that
you take him back, promote him to Deputy Chairman or something of NMG
...&#8217;.</i><br><br>104   	Mr Maconochie&#8217;s evidence is
that Mr Breeze and NMG took no action to replace Mr Crutchley and appointed him
to the position
of the newly-formed management
committee.<br><br>105   	On Mr Maconochie&#8217;s evidence, a
further NMG, AUSMAQ Systems and AUSMAQ (NZ) Limited Board set of meetings took
place on
15 July 1997 which he and Mr Hume attended.  Upon Mr Maconochie&#8217;s
arrival at the meeting, Mr Breeze apparently said that he
had just informed the
Board about the management committee, and circulated a copy of the letter which
he had handed to Mr Maconochie
on the previous day. 
<br><br>106   	Mr Maconochie then handed over a letter which he
had written in reply.  This letter appears at PX 7/2581, which
reads:<br><br><i>&#8216;Thank you for your letter of 9 July 1997 ... your
confirmation that Peter Crutchley is an Authorised Officer of NMG ... and
is
authorised to give instructions to JMG is acknowledged ... The Membership
Committee of the Management Committee of NMG is noted.
 I will arrange with the
Committee to review the company&#8217;s Objectives and Business Plan for
1997/98.  I confirm that I will
be personally available and will look forward to
attending these discussions with the NMG Management Committee.</i><br><br><i>I
note that the Management Committee of NMG is comprised of Line Managers in
AUSMAQ Australia and New Zealand.  These staff members
are responsible for
implementing the Business Plans in Australia and New Zealand.  I would
appreciate your written advice as to how
you see these staff members reconciling
that role with their responsibilities as Management Committee Members for
issuing, reconciling
and if necessary, modifying Business Plans.  A bit like the
poacher and the gamekeeper being one and the same, wouldn&#8217;t you
think?&#8217;</i><br><br>107   	Mr Maconochie&#8217;s evidence is
that after handing that letter across the meeting in substance continued inter
alia as follows.
 Mr Maconachie said:<br><br><i>&#8216;How do you propose to
separate the responsibilities and accountabilities of members of the Management
Committee of the company
to monitor the performance and recommend corrective
action and the Line Managers implementing the Business Plans when they are one
and the same.  We have a poacher and gamekeeper problem
here&#8217;.</i><br><br>108   	Mr Breeze
said:<br><br><i>&#8216;NMG doesn&#8217;t have any separate staff to undertake
that role.  All that is done in the Bank.  The people from Investments
and
Advisory and Group Strategy Development and NAB Group leadership do that.  I
have put Rod Carr on.  You should find him good
value&#8217;.</i><br><br>Mr
Maconachie said:<br><br><i>&#8216;This set up completely defeats the purpose of
having NMG.  It doesn&#8217;t do anything.  Its role is being done in the Bank
which was exactly what was to be avoided.  NMG can&#8217;t abdicate its role to
other people outside NMG.  The way it is being done
is not what was agreed
between NAB and JMG.  You know that&#8217;.</i><br><br>Mr Breeze shrugged and
said:<br><br><i>&#8216;That&#8217;s nothing to do with you&#8217;.</i><br><br>Mr
Krasnostein said:<br><br><i>&#8216;You are just a
Consultant&#8217;.</i><br><br>Mr Maconachie said:<br><br><i>&#8216;JMG is
entitled to attend all Management Committee Meetings and be heard.  How can we
do that when NMG&#8217;s role is subsumed
in the Bank.  The way you are doing
it, we don&#8217;t even know when the meetings are on, let alone who&#8217;s
there and what is
being decided and on what basis.  That&#8217;s not what we
signed up for&#8217;.</i><br><br>109   	In Mr Maconochie&#8217;s
first statement he then gives evidence that on the morning of 17 July 1997, in
the presence of Mr
Hume, he telephoned Mr Breeze and asked Mr Breeze where he
was at on addressing the management issues which he had been spoken to
about, to
be advised by Mr Breeze that it would take them about two weeks to get things
sorted out, and that it couldn&#8217;t be
done any faster.  Mr Breeze said that
he could not be more specific and Mr Maconochie said:<br><br><i>&#8216;This
place must be operated along the lines agreed with JMG and that is what we
expect to happen.  Apart from that it is not
safe to have Crutchley continuing
to run operations as he has been&#8217;.</i><br><br>110   	On Mr
Maconochie&#8217;s affidavit, on 17 July 1997 he asked Mr Crutchley to hold an
NMG Management Committee Meeting that
afternoon which was then held.  It was
attended by Mr Meikle, Mr Crutchley and Mr Maconochie.  At the meeting, on Mr
Maconochie&#8217;s
evidence, he said to Mr Crutchley and Mr
Meikle:<br><br><i>&#8216;Can you offer any suggestions as to the objectives for
the commercialisation of the AUSMAQ Service throughout the world as
required by
the Consulting Agreement&#8217;?</i><br><br>111   	On Mr
Maconochie&#8217;s evidence, Mr Crutchley and Mr Meikle said that they were not
able to offer any such suggestions, and
Mr Maconochie asked, &#8220;How can we
review those objectives if there are none&#8221;, to be advised, &#8220;We
cannot&#8221;.<br><br>112   	On 2 August 1997, on Mr
Maconochie&#8217;s evidence, he met with Mr Breeze, Mr Moore and Ms Shaw at
AUSMAQ Systems&#8217; premises
in Sydney.  On Mr Maconochie&#8217;s evidence at
this meeting the following occurred.  Mr Breeze said:<br><br><i>&#8216;Mr Meikle
will replace Mr Crutchley who will be leaving the company as Chairman of the NMG
Management Committee.  Mr Meikle
will determine the frequency of the NMG
Management Committee Meetings.  </i><br><br>113   	Mr Maconochie
said:<br><br><i>&#8216;It is essential that Management Committee meetings of NMG
be held at least quarterly.  You must hold Executive Committee or
Group
Leadership meetings, whatever you call the Management Committee in the Bank, at
least quarterly and probably once a month&#8217;.</i><br><br>Ms Shaw
said:<br><br><i>&#8216;It is only necessary to have a Management Committee
Meeting of NMG once a year.  It&#8217;s a bit like a Shareholders&#8217;
Meeting.  You can attend and be heard and you go away and come back next
year&#8217;.</i><br><br>Mr Maconochie said:<br><br><i>&#8216;What you have just
said is not in accordance with our agreement [the Consulting Agreement] and the
Annual Meeting of Shareholders
of a company cannot in any way be compared with
the Management Committee of a company&#8217;.</i><br><br>Ms Shaw
said:<br><br><i>&#8216;Well that&#8217;s all you are entitled to.  You are only
Consultants&#8217;.</i><br><br>114   	I note that the minutes of
the Management Committee Meeting of 17 July appear at PX 7/2672 and
following.<br><br><b>1 August 1997</b><br><br>115   	Under cover
of memorandum dated 1 August 1997, Mr Maconochie forwarded to NMG, and copied to
Mr Breeze and others, what he
termed &#8220;the draft of the proposed 98
Business Plan for the 3 plan years
98-2000&#8221;.<br><br>116   	This draft Business Plan is to be
found at PX 7/2674-2889.  It includes a section entitled &#8220;JMG&#8217;s
Proposed Involvement&#8221;.
[PX 2685]<br><br>117   	This section
provides inter alia:<br><br><i>&#8216;1.	The implementation of the Business
Plan, JMG&#8217;s role in it, and the safe operation of the business is
contingent upon
the recommendations in respect to organisation and staffing
being implemented.</i><br><br><i>2.	JMG requires suitable office and secretarial
support facilities to be able to properly undertake its role.  JMG secretarial
support
has been included in the Business Plan.  This, and the adoption of the
recommendations regarding the organisation and staffing will
greatly reduce the
load on JMG&#8217;s principal, J Maconochie.  It is essential for the business
that this be done.</i><br><br><i>JMG&#8217;s principal no longer has suitable
office space at the Harrington Street premises due to actions by the COO.  Until
this
is rectified, and in order to be able to properly undertake his duties,
JMG&#8217;s principal has, at considerable inconvenience,
reactivated his
development office facilities [-75m2] at 30 Stanton Road, Mosman.  AUSMAQ will
be invoiced $3000 per month for these
 facilities from June &#8217;97 inclusive
until the situation is rectified to JMG&#8217;s
satisfaction.</i><br><br><i>3.	Since February &#8217;97, JMG has meet the
standing costs (office infrastructure and secretarial) necessary to support the
active
UK market exploration program according to Plan that has been undertaken
by C Hume.  The cost is approximately 3000 pounds per month.
 The COO was not
originally prepared to meet the costs of these services, which are essential if
the job is to be undertaken efficiently
and professionally.  Accordingly, the
&#8217;98 Plan includes a monthly amount of 3000 pounds that will be billed to
AUSMAQ from
15 August &#8217;97.</i><br><br><i>4.	JMG consultants are prepared,
and have contracted, to work on a full time basis.  This does not mean 7 days
per week, 15 hours
per day continuously.  This has been necessary for extended
periods to maintain the business as a viable operating entity and to
progress
it.  The reasons have been fully documented elsewhere.  It is unacceptable for
efficiency and health reasons.  JMG consultants
will be available to work a
reasonable number of hours.  If the recommendations on organisation and staffing
are accepted, then this
will be adequate to meet the needs of the proposed
Business Plan.</i><br><br><i>5.	JMG requires a supplementary agreement with the
Bank that is aimed at bringing the current position back into balance, and
thereafter
keeping it in equilibrium.  This matter is on the agenda with
NMG&#8217;s Head of Business, Mr Breeze&#8217;.</i><br><br><b>2 August
1997</b><br><br>118   	On 2 August 1997 Mr Maconochie wrote to Mr
Breeze enclosing a copy of JMG&#8217;s meeting notes of their meeting that day.

In this letter Mr Maconochie said inter alia:<br><br><i>&#8216;I would reiterate
my statement to the meeting today, that JMG&#8217;s position has been attacked,
and today sustained a deliberate
attempt to force us out of the business, aided
and abetted by your letter of 14 July only just failed ... We need to get back
to
the position we signed up for, and which was presented in slide form to the
Board by Simon Moore in November so that we can make
the &#8220;new start&#8221;
on Monday that you have proposed.  We need information, support and positive
assistance to properly discharge
our contracted responsibilities and play our
proper role in the direction of the business.  We also need some tangible
assurances
now of the good faith that has been so sadly lacking
...</i><br><br><i>We are disturbed by the tone of this information shutdown.  We
signed up for a business partnership, and this information shutdown
has no place
in it.  It is nonsense to try to give the best advice on less than best
information.  We shall require full Board input
and output papers as a matter of
course, and regard the withdrawal of invitations to Board Meetings, whilst
freely acknowledging
they are not a JMG right, as a hostile act.  After all, we
did you and the Board&#8217;s job in rescuing the company from the CEO&#8217;s
incompetence&#8217;.</i><br><br>119   	On 5 August 1997 NMG, by
letter signed by Mr Breeze as Chairman, wrote to Idoport, attention Mr
Maconochie.  This letter is
appended as Appendix &#8220;C&#8221;.<br><br><b>8
August 1997</b><br><br>120   	On 8 August 1997 Mr Maconochie
responded by writing to Mr Breeze of NMG.  This letter is appended as Appendix
&#8220;D&#8221;.<br><br>121   	In this letter Mr Maconochie
accepted that the rights and obligations of the parties to the Consulting
Agreement were quite
clear.  He agreed with the synopsis extract in Mr
Breeze&#8217;s letter of 5 August 1997, which is sought to be emphasised
above.<br><br><b>20 August 1997</b><br><br>122   	On 20 August
1997 Mr Maconochie sent a memorandum [Appendix &#8220;E&#8221; to this judgment]
to Mr Meikle. <br><br><b>3 September 1997</b><br><br>123   	On 3
September 1997 Mr Maconochie had sent a memorandum to Mr Meikle entitled
&#8220;BT MAQ Competitive Threat&#8221;.  He
had received no reply.  His
evidence is that in September 1997 he asked Mr Meikle whether he had circulated
the BT MAQ letter to
the NMG directors to be told that the directors had been
handed the document at a Board Meeting and had laughed and rubbished JMG
and
ignored it.<br><br>124   	In paragraph 35 of Mr
Maconochie&#8217;s first statement, he gives evidence that in the first week of
September 1997 he asked
Mr Meikle when Management Committee Meetings were being
held.  His evidence is that the conversation included the
following.<br><br>125   	Mr Maconochie:<br><br><i>&#8216;You and
I agreed back in June that they should be held at least quarterly.  It is coming
up to the start of the end of the
financial year and the Management Committee

Meikle:<br><br><i>&#8216;<u>I have been instructed by the Bank not to hold NMG
Management Committee Meetings&#8217;</u>.</i><br><br>Mr
Maconochie:<br><br><i>&#8216;But Breeze told me that you and I should consult

Meikle:<br><br><i>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know.  I&#8217;ll ask him but I

about the Business Plan?  What is happening here?  If the NMG Management

Meikle:<br><br><i>&#8216;Simon Moore and Investment and Advisory are handling
it.   Simon has got Ian Clarke from Coopers &amp; Lybrand working with
him on

has written to me about the draft Plan you submitted.
 You won&#8217;t like what
he has to say about it&#8217;.</i><br><br>Mr
Maconochie:<br><br><i>&#8216;What&#8217;s Moore got to do with it?  It&#8217;s
none of the Bank&#8217;s business.  This should be handed by
NMG&#8217;.</i><br><br>Mr Meikle:<br><br><i>&#8216;There are a few &#8220;please

asked why they did a deal structured like this</u>.  Moore is doing a
revalidation of the AUSMAQ acquisition.  It&#8217;s part of
that&#8217;.</i><br>[Emphasis added]<br><br><b>25 September
1997</b><br><br>126   	On 25 September 1997 Mr Meikle from AUSMAQ
sent a memorandum to Mr Maconochie thanking him for the AUSMAQ Business Plan
submitted
by JMG and advising:<br><br><i>&#8216;The Management and Board of
AUSMAQ are now in the process of finalising the Strategy and Business Plan for
the coming year.
 The purpose of this memo, in accordance with our contractual
arrangements with JMG, is to provide you with a draft of the 1997/98
Business
Plan and to invite your comments and suggestions.  A copy of the current draft
AUSMAQ Business Plan is attached for your
consideration.</i><br><br><i>You will
see from this draft that the Business Plan, while substantially complete, still
requires some work in finalising certain
aspects of the detail, in particular,
the individual Operational Plans for the various Divisions within the
Company.</i><br><br><i>In summary the proposed Business Plan is significantly
less ambitious than either the second year of the original Plan or the Plan
submitted by JMG.  The draft Business Plan, and associated Budget, focuses on
the commercialisation of the AUSMAQ System and the
consolidation of the
company&#8217;s position and reputation in the Australian and New Zealand
marketplaces.  The reason for this
focus is essentially twofold.  Firstly, as
you are aware, the company is effectively 12 months behind where it should have
been had
certain elements of the original Plan been fulfilled this year. 
Secondly and more importantly, the company is required by its shareholders,
to
validate the value proposition as currently defined.  Specifically, this
required proof of the financial viability of AUSMAQ through
the successful
implementation of the Service, on normal commercial terms, to each of three
selected distribution channels.  Accordingly,
the strategy underling the
Business Plan, and the mechanics to actually implement the Business Plan, are
focussed on the commercialisation
of the Service to a select number of
identified customers and targets.  This revised focus has necessitated a change
in the Sales/Marketing
operating and implementation
strategies.</i><br><br><i>What has become clear in the last few months is that a
number of system enhancement developments identified in scenario two of last
year&#8217;s Business Plan are now considered fundamental to the successful
commercialisation of the system in the near term.  Accordingly,
the Business
Plan includes appropriate allowance for the development of a number of specific
system projects including the front
and interface for the &#8220;end to
end&#8221; solution, superannuation/tax advantaged accounts, shares, and a
degree of process
redesign.  The costings for these developments have been taken
from scenario two of the original Business Plan.</i><br><br><i>I look forward to
discussing the proposed Strategic and Operational Plans for the company with you
on Friday&#8217;.	</i>[PX 7/2936]<br><br>127   	Mr Maconochie
complains in paragraph 36 of his first statement that the Draft Proposed 1998
Business Plan, furnished to him
on 26 September 1997 by Mr Meikle, made no
reference to any Management Committee Meetings.  He points out that the
Organisational
Structure diagram made no reference to JMG, and its role, other
than to show under the Technology and Project Management box a sub-box:
&#8220;JMG Technical Consultants - Graham Nelson, Brian
Martin&#8221;.<br><br>128   	Mr Maconochie, in paragraph 36 of
his first statement, also asserts that the forum at which the Management and
Board of AUSMAQ
were finalising the Strategy and Business Plan for the following
year was, and remains, unknown to him.  His evidence is that it
was not the
management committee of NMG.  In this regard he refers to the memorandum of 25
September 1997 [extract above set out],
which had stated:<br><br><i>&#8216;The
Management and Board of AUSMAQ are now in the process of finalising the Strategy
and Business Plan for the following
year&#8217;.</i><br><br>129   	In his first statement Mr
Maconochie sets out the further developments of October 1997, including
reference to a meeting of
21 October 1997 when Mr Hume and Mr McConochie met
with Mr Meikle, Mr Moore, Ms McGrath from the Bank and Mr Clarke of Coopers
&amp;
Lybrand at AUSMAQ Systems&#8217; Sydney premises.  The substance of the
meeting in Mr Maconochie&#8217;s evidence was as
follows.<br><br>130   	Mr Maconochie said:<br><br><i>&#8216;We
want to talk about the independence agenda item&#8217;.</i><br><br>Mr Moore
said:<br><br><i>&#8216;Well I don&#8217;t know what that has to do with
anything&#8217;.</i><br><br>Mr Maconochie said:<br><br><i>&#8216;You&#8217;ve
read the document on independence that I wrote and which I believe Roger
circulated to the directors at their
meeting this morning.</i><br><br>Mr Moore
said:<br><br><i>&#8216;Yes, but I don&#8217;t see the point of the issue or the
discussion.  The company was insolvent when be bought it&#8217;.</i><br><br>Mr
Maconochie said:<br><br><i>&#8216;The point is that as the document states, the
company is not being operated independently and the company&#8217;s Business
Plans are not being developed external to the parent shareholder, the Bank. 
These Business Plans are not being reviewed and approved
to go forward on the
recommendation of the NMG Management Committee as we agreed.  That was the basis
of our deal with the Bank.
 You were there.  You know that as well as I do.  The
financial situation of the holding company was irrelevant.  It had been
deliberately
put into administration to enable the restructure with AIDC.  And
AUSMAQ Systems and Market Holdings were not insolvent.  They were
both going
concerns and we sold you an exclusivity period.  We had other investors which we
put aside in your favour as you well
know&#8217;.</i><br><br>Mr Moore
said:<br><br><i>&#8216;I still don&#8217;t see how independence and those other
issues you mention are relevant now.  Nothing will change&#8217;.</i><br><br>Mr
Maconochie said:<br><br><i>&#8216;The business is not under effective
intellectual control now that JMG and myself have been excluded.  There is no
one with
the knowledge or experience to lead it&#8217;.</i><br><br>Mr Meikle
said:<br><br><i>&#8216;I agree with you the business lacks intellectual
leadership.  There is a stalemate in relations between JMG and the Bank. 
AUSMAQ
is making inefficient use of JMG&#8217;s potential&#8217;.</i><br><br>Mr Hume
said:<br><br><i>&#8216;AUSMAQ corporate governance is ineffective and has
contributed materially to the Crutchley debacle and the breakdown in
relationships
between JMG and the Bank&#8217;.</i><br><br>Mr Maconochie
said:<br><br><i>&#8216;We need to know exactly what is going on here.  Have you
seen the draft letter Roger Meikle sent to you that he is proposing
to send to
me.  According to Roger it is an accurate description of the
situation&#8217;.</i><br><br>Mr Moore
said:<br><br><i>&#8216;Yes&#8217;.</i><br><br>Mr Maconochie
said:<br><br><i>&#8216;Well what do you say about it?&#8217;</i><br><br>Mr Moore
said:<br><br><i>&#8216;I was astounded&#8217;.</i><br><br>Mr Maconochie
said:<br><i>&#8216;Let&#8217;s go through each item in it shall we?  I think
that will help determine where we are.  What about the Management
Committee item
in paragraph 6?  Or rather do you disagree with anything in the
letter?&#8217;</i><br><br>Mr Moore was silent.<br><br>In regard to the
Consulting Agreement, Ms McGrath said:<br><br><i>&#8216;<u>JMG is no different
to any other consultant group used by the NAB Group.  It has no right to attend
Management Committee Meetings
of the NMG&#8217;</u>.</i><br><br>Mr Maconochie
said:<br><br><i>&#8216;That&#8217;s not correct.  No other consultant group used
by NAB has a Consulting Agreement that gives it representation on
the Management
Committee of the company and pays it substantial royalties and gross revenue,
amongst other things.  Isn&#8217;t that
correct Simon?&#8217;</i><br><br>Mr
Moore was silent.       [Emphasis added]<br><br>131   	Mr
Maconochie&#8217;s evidence is that he and Mr Hume again met Mr Meikle on 22
October 1997 and Mr Meikle said, in relation
to the meeting of the previous day,
as follows:<br><br><i>&#8216;No [Simon] was not happy with the meeting
yesterday. He was very unhappy.  He thought it went very badly.  After you left
me
said to me: &#8220;Why did I tell them [Hume and Maconochie] all those things
about how things really are?  Why didn&#8217;t you
tell them something else?  I
told them that wasn&#8217;t my way and that I was always open with you.  He
would find out anyway, and
if I didn&#8217;t let you know what was happening it
would then be difficult for me to work with
you&#8217;.</i><br><br>132   	The events between roughly
mid-August 1997 and the forwarding on 22 June 1998 by Mr Barnes QC counsel for
the plaintiffs to
the defendants with a draft statement of claim are chronicled
by a large section of correspondence principally passing from JMG to
NMG or to
bank officers.  By letter dated 17 March 1998 JMG (Mr Maconochie) wrote to NMG,
attention Mr Meikle, asking that there
be addressed &#8220;the now 44 pieces of
correspondence requiring a response from NMG ...&#8221;. 
<br><br>133   	It is inappropriate to presently set out so much
of exhibit PX 7 as sets out the majority of this correspondence.  For relevant
purposes the correspondence can be found generally from approximately PX 7/2901
through to approximately the end of PX 7.<br><br>134   	An
example of the approach taken by Mr Maconochie is to be seen in his memorandum
to Mr Meikle of 20 August 1997 [PX7/2909].
 It deals with the background to the
structure and to what Mr Maconochie refers to as &#8220;the philosophy&#8221; in
relation to
his understanding of the transaction.  He says inter
alia:<br><br><i>&#8216;The philosophy was, and presumably still is, to set up a
stand alone holding company [NMG] that is operated independently of
other NAB
group operations.</i><br><br><i>NMG would therefore have its own culture,
objectives, strategy, and method of implementation all as contained in the
Business Plan
of the day.  NMG would have carriage of the global development of
AUSMAQ.  NAB Group, as the sole and controlling shareholder of
NMG, would
therefore have outright control of NMG and accordingly, all its subsidiary
operating entities, from day 1.</i><br><br><i>The strategy of the AUSMAQ Group
would be determined at the NMG level, and implemented by NMG&#8217;s operating
entities.  This strategy,
and its implementation according to the Business Plan
approved by NMG, would be fed into the relevant NAB Group areas for monitoring
or reporting purposes, for example GSD, Group Accounting, Group Legal.  Where
applicable, NMG could draw on NAB Group resources.
 As the sole shareholder, NAB
Group would have the usual prerogative of a controlling shareholder to
ultimately determine the NMG&#8217;s
Business Plan.</i><br><br><i>In respect of
the founder of the business, there would be a balance of interests that would be
reflected in  terms of the transaction.
 There would be a common goal of
business profitability.  In practice, this would involve a broad split of roles,
with JMG working
on product and market development, and NMG being the final
arbiter of investment decisions and focusing on the management of the
operations.</i><br><br><i>From JMG&#8217;s viewpoint, this approach carried some
risks for both parties, but more so for JMG,<u> as it depended on the good faith
of the parties</u>.  JMG took the view that it ultimately didn&#8217;t matter
what was written down and necessarily who had the legal control, since
a
successful enterprise would always require  the good faith of both parties for
it to work in the critical short to medium term;
in this key period, there would
be a balance between the dependencies on JMG&#8217;s unique skills and the
capital that would be
required from the shareholder to establish the business
and grow it.</i><br><br><i>[The structure initially suggested by I &amp; A to
JMG was one involving control by JMG initially, and later transferring to NAB
Group.
 However, the current structure was agreed to provide transparency and to
leave the market in no doubt as to who would end up controlling
the enterprise -
the one ship, one master principle.  It was judged, correctly I believe, that it
was better to start out the way
we all intended to operate some time down the
line, because this would give the market an enhanced confidence
level.]</i><br><i>...</i><br><br><b>What is the root of the problem that needs
to be addressed?</b><br><br><i>The root of the problem is believed to be a
<u>conflict of actual operation objectives between NAB&#8217;s Group traditional
businesses and AUSMAQ&#8217;s operating objectives</u>, notwithstanding that the
overall articulated objectives are clear at the I &amp; A and senior management
level; lip service at the
operation levels in the traditional businesses may be
paid to these overall high level objectives, but whilst a good game is talked,
it is not played.</i><br><br><i>This was recognised at the outset by setting up
the National Markets Group as an entity operated independently of the
traditional
business.</i><br><br><i>... It is considered<u> important to avoid
the &#8220;gamekeeper and poacher&#8221; problem</u>, where key positions in the
AUSMAQ Group are subject to executive action and oversight by one and the same
persons ...</i><br><br><i>There are two key issues that need to be addressed
now.</i><br><br><i>(1)	The governance of AUSMAQ [NMG and the operating entities]
needs to be made independently of the traditional business executive
... the
governance objective can be achieved by the appointment of an independent
Chairman and Board members at each of the NMG and
operating entity
levels&#8217;. </i><br>[Emphasis added]<br><br>135   	This theme
has continued in terms of Mr Maconochie&#8217;s complaints to this
day.<br><br>136   	Later correspondence, such as Mr
Maconochie&#8217;s memorandum of 3 September 1997 to Mr Meikle, refers to the
competitive
threat posed by the development work underway at BT.  Mr Maconochie
had apparently advised Mr Meikle that BT had committed substantial
funds and
technical resources to the creation of a potential competitor to AUSMAQ.  He had
apparently informed Mr Meikle that he
regarded this of urgent and strategic
importance to AUSMAQ.<br><br>137   	This memorandum includes many
seriously put complaints by Mr Maconochie suggesting that AUSMAQ was then
&#8220;rudderless&#8221;.
 At PX 2922 Mr Maconochie&#8217;s opinion is voiced in
the following fashion:<br><br><i>&#8216;JMG has consistently advised NAB/NMG and
the AUSMAQ Boards that we had a window of opportunity that was finite.  JMG has
advised
that the worst possible mistake the Bank could make would be to show the
world how it was done, prove it, and then fail to exploit
AUSMAQ&#8217;s [huge]
lead by establishing an unassailable position before the competition reverse
engineered our system and opened
for business.  Only time and money stand
between companies like BT ... and success in doing just that.  NAB, NMG and the
Boards of
AUSMAQ, against our repeated and insistent advice, have made that
gross error.  The naive and concentrated stupidity of this appalling
strategic
blunder is breathtaking.  It is all the more galling that AUSMAQ strategy, which
was implemented unswervingly and successfully
over a number of years, which
piloted AUSMAQ into a winning position with a huge prize in sight, and which was
astutely identified
by the Bank&#8217;s I &amp; A Group, should be so recklessly
squandered in such a short space of time.</i><br><br><i>AUSMAQ will never
prosper while it is chained, restricted and held back by the all pervasive
incompetence that is choking it.  Continuation
of drip feed funding, eked out by
the AUSMAQ Board/GSD/NMG/Group, Legal/group, Accounting/group, Management
System, whose comprehensive
inability and failure to grasp the strategic
situation has now been starkly illuminated by BT, will surely cure AUSMAQ and
thereby
render NAB&#8217;s investment worthless within 6-12 months to say
nothing of the enormous loss of strategic and value added wealth
creation
opportunity to the Bank that far outweighs its investment in AUSDMAQ.
...</i><br><br><i>One thing&#8217;s for sure.  A continuation of the way AUSMAQ
has been run since 7 November 1996 is a dead set loser; any mug punter
can see
that.  The pity of it is that if this happens, BT will end up with a fabulous
business within 5 years that makes its current
funds management success story
pale into insignificance, and that&#8217;s what they aim to do.  And good old
NAB will go safely into
the first 10-15 years of the next century playing catch
up again as the world moves past funds management per se into the lush green
customer fields that AUSMAQ pioneered.  That scenario, very likely unless the
Bank wakes up, now, will make its experience with AC
Goode look like an
unqualified success.</i><br><br><b>The right way forward</b><br><br><i>The only
way forward is for the Bank to fund AUSMAQ as a stand alone, independent, fully
financed company with JMG directing its activities
as it contracted to do,
subject to the proper checks and balances we proposed and put in place to
protect the banks, and JMG&#8217;s,
interests.  Sound familiar?  It should do -
it&#8217;s the deal JMG agreed with NAB and signed on for on 6 November last
year.  It&#8217;s
a pity the Bank hasn&#8217;t implemented it
yet.</i><br><br><i>Sadly those checks and balances are being misused and abused
by the staggering incompetence and stupidity with which a relatively
small
number of bank officers are employing them to strangle the business ...
</i><br><br><i>In my own case I still don&#8217;t have the office I was promised
by Mr Breeze for myself and my fellow consultants and support staff
... it is
nonsensical to have the one person who just might have the knowledge and ability
to deal with this situation, completely
locked out from the business and
powerless in any way to assist it, let alone chart a safe course for it to sail
to prosperity, whilst
this ludicrous situation persists.  None of the hired
hands there have a snowflake&#8217;s chance&#8217;.</i><br><br>[PX 2920 and
following]<br><br>138   	A memorandum from Mr Meikle to Mr
Maconochie of 25 September 1997 enclosed the draft Business
Plan.<br><br>139   	By memorandum dated 23 October 1997 JMG wrote
to Mr Meikle stating inter alia:<br><br><i>&#8216;One point we did not discuss
was JMG&#8217;s further contribution to the Business Plan.  We understand that
JMG will not be
required in the future to contribute to the high level business
strategy nor as a consequence be involved in the formulation of review
of
Business Plans.  Also that the Business Plans may be amended at any time but we
will not necessarily be advised&#8217;.	</i>[PX
7/2970]<br><br>140   	The document at PX 7/2975, being a draft
which Mr Maconochie prepared intending to have Mr Meikle send, but which was
never
sent, nevertheless speaks to Mr Maconochie&#8217;s perception of
NMG&#8217;s then position.  It suggests that Idoport was advised,
in or about
October 1997, of the results of &#8220;the recent Management and Organisational
Restructuring and JMG&#8217;s Future
Rule and Relationship with
NMG/AUSMAQ&#8221;.  Page 2 of the document records Mr Maconochie&#8217;s intent
to seek to have Mr Meikle
formally confirm that instructions had been given as
to JMG&#8217;s role and the procedures required to be followed by JMG, including
the statement that NAB&#8217;s overall strategy is a global perspective, but
that GSD has directed that this does not apply to
NMG/AUSMAQ:<br><br><i>&#8216;GSD has abandoned the long term global targets for
the AUSMAQ service.  AUSMAQ&#8217;s business is now limited to Australia
and New
Zealand&#8217;.</i><br><br>141   	The draft letter also included
a statement that AUSMAQ&#8217;s scope for the 1998 Plan year is limited to
&#8220;bedding down
existing clients&#8221;.<br><br>142   	Mr
Maconochie also intended to seek to have Mr Meikle sign two paragraphs
reading:<br><br><i>&#8216;It is unnecessary for any NMG Management Committee
Meetings to be scheduled for 1997/1998 as Group Strategic Development has
now
laid down the Business Plan and all that remains now is for AUSMAQ to get on
with implementing it. ...</i><br><br><i>... GSD considers that JMG is in no
different to any other consultant group used by the NAB Group.  GSD neither
needs nor wants further
involvement by yourself in AUSMAQ&#8217;s business. 
This sentiment has also been communicated by Bank officers to the market as
part
of the restructuring of AUSMAQ&#8217;.</i><br><br>143   	Plainly
the letter is to be viewed as Mr Maconochie&#8217;s private document - but it
gives support as a contemporaneous document,
to Mr Maconochie&#8217;s case of
then frustration to the extent of the matters referred to in the
draft.<br><br>144   	By letter dated 21 November 1997, Mr
Maconochie wrote to Mr Meikle advising:<br><br><i>&#8216;I understand that the
NMG Board at its meeting on 18 November 1997 has rejected JMG&#8217;s
recommendation to you that was
set out in my memo to you of 12 November 1997 and
instead has accepted Mr Krasnostein&#8217;s recommendation that no further
activity
would ever be undertaken in Europe to further AUSMAQ&#8217;s interests
for the next two years.</i><br><br><i>JMG&#8217;s earlier advice continues to
apply, namely that this decision will kill any possibility of AUSMAQ achieving a
global operation
and henceforth will restrict it to Australia and New
Zealand&#8217;.</i><br><br>145   	From early February 1998 Mr
Maconochie was receiving and sending correspondence relating to the restructure
of the Depositee
accounts [ PX 7/3040 and following].  This document is a
comprehensive memorandum from Mr Martin to Mr Maconochie as to the proposed
structure with NAB as Depositee.<br><br>146   	On 5 March 1998 Mr
Meikle notified Mr Maconochie that Ms McGrath, general counsel of NMG, was also
an Authorised Officer for
the purpose of the Consulting Agreement.  This
appointment was apparently challenged on formal
grounds.<br><br>147   	By letter dated 26 March 1998 Mr Meikle,
writing on behalf of AUSMAQ, notified Mr Maconochie that AIDC would shortly be
replaced
as Depositee by the Bank.<br><br>148   	At a meeting on
28 May 1998 attended by Messrs Meikle and McGrath on behalf of NMG, and Messrs
Maconochie and Martin on behalf
of JMG, the minutes of which are headed
&#8220;NMG Management Committee Meeting&#8221;, Mr Maconochie [see item 5 of the
minutes]
sought a deal of information and stated that JMG &#8220;could not do
the 1999 Business Plan without having the full set of information
that JMG had
requested ...&#8221;, and further that &#8220;it should not have been necessary
to request this information.  NMG was
obliged to provide it on an ongoing basis
as a matter of course but had refused to do so ... it was not impossible for JMG
to complete
the 1999 Business Plan, given the lack of involvement imposed by NMG
and the lack on ongoing information&#8221;.  The minutes of
the meeting of 28
May 1998 include a table identifying unanswered correspondence from the Bank
[see PX 3474 &amp; 5].<br><br>149   	By letter dated 29 May 1998
JMG by Mr Maconochie wrote to NMG in terms of the letter appended to this
judgment and marked PX
8/3471 and following.  Relevantly a copy of that letter
was forwarded to Mr Garnsey QC.  Clearly, matters had reached a head by this
point in time with allegations that the 28 May meeting was a sham and a farce
and could not in any way be regarded as a bona fide
meeting of the management
committee of the company.  Mr Maconochie stated:<br><br><i>&#8216;JMG will not
therefore accept that any meeting of the Management Committee of the company has
yet taken place to which it has
been given the opportunity to attend, and awaits
notice from the company of the papers for a bona fide meeting of the Management
Committee of the company which it has repeatedly requested, but as yet to no
avail&#8217;.</i><br><br>150   	In his letter of 20 July 1998 [PX
3684] to NMG, Mr Maconochie, in relation to &#8220;Business Plan
information&#8221;, stated:<br><br><i>&#8216;JMG records that there has been no
bona fide meeting of the Management Committee of the company to review the
objectives etc
of the company.  It would be disingenuous on the part of NMG to
represent that there had been any such meeting.</i><br><br><i>JMG submitted the
draft 98/99 Business Plan to NMG on 14 July 1998 </i>[this being a reference to
PX 8/3419-3551].  <i>JMG records that NMG did not comply with any of its
obligations in respect to the Business Plan as JMG makes clear in its draft
Business
Plan&#8221;.</i><br><br>151   	PX 8/3419 comprises Mr
Maconochie&#8217;s letter to Mr Meikle enclosing the draft 98/99 Business Plan
which in paragraph 1,
under the head &#8220;Base Information&#8221;, [PX 3422]
states inter alia:<br><br><i>&#8220;NMG, and its subsidiaries AUSMAQ
Systems/AUSMAQ (New Zealand) are obliged in accordance with the Consulting
Agreement to provide
JMG with complete information about the companies and the
business.</i><br><br><i>In breach of the Consulting Agreement, the parent NAB,
has directed that JMG be excluded from the business and the company.  NAB,
on
the advice of its lawyers Freehill Hollingdale &amp; Page, has directed that no
information whatsoever be provided to JMG ...</i><br><br><i>The 1998 Business
Plan was not provided to JMG, nor any amendments that may have been made to it
during the course of the business
year and the reason for them.  JMG has
repeatedly requested the information it requires but to no avail
...</i><br><br><i>JMG has latterly been forced to resort to sending letters from
its solicitors to obtain the information NMG is obliged to provide,
and further,
that JMG requires to meet its obligations in accordance with the Consulting
Agreement, to no avail ... Apparently it
will be necessary for JMG to take legal
advice to obtain this information.</i><br><br><i>It has not therefore been
possible at this stage for JMG to make a thorough quantitative reconciliation of
actual performance against
what the companies may have planned to do.  JMG is
therefore reliant on its observation of the company&#8217;s performance in the
marketplace, the situation at the National Australia Bank, and the state of
developments of the AUSMAQ service and the organisation
that supports it based
on technical reports from its technical consultant, Mr Martin
...&#8221;.		</i>[PX 3422]<br><br>152   	In Mr Maconochie&#8217;s
sixth statement at paragraph 8.6 on p 45, he gives evidence that as far as he is
aware the 1999 Business
Plan, which he formulated for JMG in July 1998, was not
implemented and that JMG received no response to it, and that JMG&#8217;s
recommendations were apparently ignored.  His evidence is that JMG was not
provided with a copy of any Business Plan for the year
ended 30 September 1999,
which may have been adopted, if one had been.<br><br><b>Business Plans for the
Years to September 1999 and 2000</b><br><br>153   	There is no
evidence before the Court as to what if any Business Plan, within the meaning of
Clause 4.2 of the Consultancy
Agreement, was prepared by NMG or was adopted or
followed by it for the year to September 1999.  This is an important matter as
it
seems to me, bearing in mind the substance of the motion and the allegations
put by JMG, generally to the effect that NMG has been
and remains to be operated
on an ad hoc basis without proper direction and without any reasonable flow of
information to JMG.  I
infer from NMG&#8217;s failure to tender or produce any
Business Plan for the period to September 1999 that no such Business Plan
was
prepared, or alternatively that if prepared, it was not followed, or
alternatively that if prepared and followed, it was a document
which NMG was not
content be produced to JMG, so that its performance against that Plan could be
measured, or to the Court so that
the plan could be
examined.<br><br>154   	In paragraph 8.8 of his sixth statement
Mr Maconochie, in relation to the position with respect to a 2000 Business Plan,
gives
evidence that failure to reply to his correspondence has meant that he has
insufficient information to formulate the 2000 Business
Plan.  On 15 February
1999 [PX 11/4586] Mr Maconochie wrote to NMG seeking to make recommendations and
enclosing a report entitled
&#8220;Global Commercialisation of the AUSMAQ
Service&#8221;.  No substantial response on Mr Maconochie&#8217;s evidence was
given
to this letter or report.  <br><br><b>The Substance of JMG&#8217;s
Allegations</b><br><br>155   	In final submissions the defendants
sought to summarise Mr Maconochie&#8217;s allegations of the bases to his fears
that the
Bank is damaging and destroying the business of NMG and the NMG Group,
and that unless the relief is given, the business and undertaking
of NMG will be
irretrievably damaged.  The defendants&#8217; short summary of these bases is as
follows:<br><i>&#8216;(a)	Damage to and alienation of JMG&#8217;s (sic) custom
and goodwill in respect of the Ausmaq service namely:</i><br><br><i>(i)	the
failure to investigate the Joslin opportunity;</i><br><i>(ii)	the failure to pay
for the continued registration of the name &#8220;Euromaq&#8221; in the
UK;</i><br><i>(iii)	the failure to pursue the Morning Star
opportunity;</i><br><i>(iv)	the failure to pursue the Exchange
opportunity;</i><br><i>(v)	the failure to develop Euromaq;</i><br><i>(vi)	the
NMG director&#8217;s alienation of custom by cancelling a
lunch;</i><br><i>(b)	Damage to NMG&#8217;s and the Ausmaq Service&#8217;s
competitive position in appointing NAB the depositee;</i><br><i>(c)	Damage to
the integrity and operation of the Ausmaq Service by means of Unauthorised
Technical alterations;</i><br><i>(d)	Establishment of Maple Leaf, Independence
One;</i><br><i>(e)	The &#8220;JMG
Report&#8221;.&#8217;</i><br><br>156   	There is of course a
substantial further matter of complaint relating to JMG&#8217;s allegations that
the defendants have failed
to cause to be held Management Committee Meetings in
accordance with the Consultancy Agreement, and have failed to permit the meeting
or meetings stipulated for by Clause 4.1 to take place between JMG and the
management committee, hence derailing, on JMG&#8217;s
submissions, the intended
Clause 4 regime..<br><br>157   	The defendants relied upon only
three affidavits which were read.  They were the affidavits of Mr Purcell of 15
July 1999,
Ms Cox of 15 July 1999, and Mr Copsey of 16 July
1999.<br><br>158   	Mr Purcell is the Head of IT Strategy and
Development of AUSMAQ System employed by National, but seconded in April 1998 to
his current position at AUSMAQ System.  <br><br>159   	Ms Cox is
Chief Financial Officer of each of NMG, AUSMAQ Systems and AUSMAQ New Zealand. 
She is also Head of Corporate Services
of AUSMAQ
Systems.<br><br>160   	Mr Copsey is Head of the Australian Bank
Legal at the Bank with responsibility for national legal
matters.<br><br>161   	None of these witnesses was able to deal,
or did deal, with the question of the Management Committee Meetings, or the
history
of Business Plans or draft Business Plans, regarding the development of
the AUSMAQ Service by the Group.  In a case such as the present
it may seem
surprising, for example, that Mr Crutchley was not called, and that Mr Meikle
was not called.  Those were the persons
nominated as comprising the management
committee, and on Mr Maconochie&#8217;s evidence he told Mr Crutchley in June
1997 that the
management committee was an essential requirement of the contract
and required to implement the Business Plan delivered to them by
NMG. 
<br><br>162   	Ms Shaw was not called to respond to Mr
Maconochie&#8217;s evidence that on 2 August 1997 she had said that it was only
necessary
to have a Management Committee [Meeting] of NMG once a year, and that
Mr Maconochie [and JMG] could attend and be heard and then
were to &#8220;go
away and come back next year&#8221;.<br><br>163   	Nor was
evidence adduced from the defendants even on an information and belief basis, to
traverse these allegations.  Not even
the allegation made by Mr Maconochie that
in early September 1997 when he asked Mr Meikle when Management Committee
Meetings were
being held, Mr Meikle said that he had been instructed by the Bank
not to hold NMG committee meetings, was traversed even on information
and belief
from Mr Meikle.<br><br>164   	The whole of the evidence adduced
on the interlocutory motion and the contemporaneous documents satisfies me that
there has
been no effective attempt made by NMG or the Bank to hold Management
Committee Meetings, or to permit the management committee to
meet with JMG [see
Clause 4.1], as contemplated by the Consultancy Agreement for a considerable
time now.     This is an important
consideration in relation to the relief being
sought by the plaintiffs.  Whilst many other parameters of the plaintiffs&#8217;
complaints
resolve down on the evidence to complaints, which may or may not at
the final hearing ultimately prove to have real substance and
basis, the
Management Committee Meeting complaint is of altogether another order.  To my
mind the evidence adduced on the interlocutory
motion establishes quite plainly
that JMG has been excluded from any involvement in the preparation of Business
Plans as contemplated
by the Consultancy
Agreement.<br><br>165   	The other complaints summarised by the
defendants and set out above are difficult to adjudicate upon an interlocutory
motion.
 There is to my mind made out on the interlocutory motion a serious case
to be tried in support of JMG&#8217;s allegation that a
number of specific
opportunities said to have been available by way of furthering the AUSMAQ
service, have not been followed, or
have not been followed with reasonable
expedition, or have been allowed to fall away without proper investigation.  In
short a serious
case to be tried has been made out upon the interlocutory
motion, in support of JMG&#8217;s allegations that NMG has not used sufficient
capital, goodwill, organisational or marketing resources world-wide to
commercialise the AUSMAQ service globally in a timely, efficient
and proper
manner.  Hence a serious case to be tried has been made out on the interlocutory
motion, of a failure by NMG to permit
the operation, development and
commercialisation of the AUSMAQ service throughout the world, and to carry out
such steps as were
reasonably practicable in that regard.  As will be seen from
what follows below, to my mind the plaintiffs have established a strong
probability that there was to be implied into the Consultancy Agreement a
term:<br><br><i>&#8216;That NMG should take all reasonable steps to enable the
implementation and operation of the Consulting Agreement, including
the
provision of adequate finance, management and personnel to enable the operation
and commercialisation of the AUSMAQ systems and
business throughout Australia
and globally&#8217;.</i><br><br>166   	To my mind a serious case
for trial has been shown on the interlocutory motion to the effect that this
term has been breached
and that the Bank has induced or procured such breaches
by NMG.  A serious case for trial has also been made out to the effect that
a
like term to be implied into the Consultancy Agreement bound the Bank to take
such reasonable steps.<br><br>167   	As to the other and specific
complaints by JMG, it is appropriate to refer particularly to the claim to
damage to NMG&#8217;s
and the AUSMAQ&#8217;s system competitive position caused
by the replacement of AIDC with the Bank as depositee.  Mr Maconochie in
his
second statement at paragraph 43.2 expresses the opinion that the appointment by
the Bank as replacement depositee &#8220;has
substantially diminished, if not
precluded, the ability of the AUSMAQ service to address Australia&#8217;s
financial markets as a
settlement agent and trading
service&#8221;.<br><br>168   	In final submissions the Bank
submitted that if Mr Maconochie&#8217;s said opinion was to be accepted, and if
he was to be
believed in this regard, &#8220;the damage has already been done,
i.e. the appointment has substantially diminished if not precluded
the ability
of the AUSMAQ service to address Australia&#8217;s financial markets as a
settlement agent and trading service&#8221;.<br><br>169   	Here
again a serious question has been raised by the plaintiffs on the interlocutory
motion for determination on the final
hearing on this
issue.<br><br>170   	I deal with the Bank&#8217;s projects and
proposed services below.<br><br>171   	I note the
defendants&#8217; contention in final submissions [paragraph 5.17] that
&#8220;the Consulting Agreement contains
no express terms as to the composition
or role of the management committee&#8221;.  It is then contended that one of
the major difficulties
with an order giving relief by way of requiring that
Management Committee Meetings be held is that there is substantial disagreement
between the parties as to what the Consulting Agreement requires in relation to
the management committee.<br><br>172   	The judgment below deals
with questions going to the proper construction of the Consultancy Agreement in
relation to the management
committee.  The parties having, on the
plaintiffs&#8217; submissions, contractually agreed upon a regime, an important
part of which
required the holding of Management Committee Meetings, the
plaintiffs submit that it is no answer for the defendants to now assert
that
such Management Committee Meetings cannot, and should not, be held.  The
submission is that the position may be quite different
were the Consultancy
Agreement to have been rescinded by one party or the other.  Both parties
steadfastly maintain that the agreement
remains on foot.  In circumstances in
which the burden of the plaintiffs&#8217; serious case to be tried relates to
the allegation
that the Bank has effectively side-lined the AUSMAQ service and
is progressing by utilising the &#8220;system IP rights&#8221; as
defined in the
Consulting Agreement outside of NMG, and outside of the AUSMAQ service, and in
the circumstance in which JMG and the
consultants remain subject to the
extensive restrictive covenants imposed by the terms of the Consultancy
Agreement and ancillary
agreements, the plaintiffs submit that the balance of
convenience requires that the management committee regime be reinstated, so
that
at the very least JMG has an opportunity to be heard at such meetings and to
play its proper role in relation to preparation
of draft Business Plans and in
receiving amended Business Plans and the like.  The submission is that without a
management committee,
JMG is denied its contractual entitlement provided for in
Clause 4.1(a), to meet with that committee to review the stated objectives
of
the Group, so as then to be seised of sufficient information to enable it to
comply with Clause 4.1(b).<br><br>173   	An important
consideration in relation to the hearing of the motion has been the inference
that the persons who were not called
by the Bank as above referred to, would not
have assisted the Bank&#8217;s case on the motion.  The further inference which
is appropriate
is that the Bank&#8217;s failure to call witnesses in relation to
the &#8220;functional equivalence&#8221; question was because such
witnesses
could not assist the Bank&#8217;s case on that question.                    
<br><br><b>Dealing with the Motion</b><br><br><b>A difficult case to be dealt
with at an interlocutory stage </b><br><br>174   	It has to be
said that the present is a very difficult case insofar as the interlocutory
motion is concerned.  The respective
cases clearly cry out for determination at
a final hearing, which hearing may be expected to take an extended time and to
involve
voluminous documents and evidence given by numerous witnesses, including
many witnesses at expert level.  In a curious way the task
of a Judge in
relation to the final hearing may be expected to be far easier than the task of
determining this interlocutory motion,
because on the final hearing all the
evidence ought to be before the Court, and final, as opposed to interim,
decisions both as to
principles and as to facts, and as to the application of
principles to facts, can be given.<br><br><b>Relevance of
Delay</b><br><br>175   	A most significant and well understood
discretionary consideration in relation to interlocutory applications for
injunctive
relief, and for relief in the nature of appointment of receivers and
managers, is and has always been that a plaintiff requires to
commence such
proceedings with special expedition.  Alaintiff who sits on his or her hands,
whilst well aware that claimed rights
are being infringed, takes the risk that
interlocutory relief may be refused depending upon all the circumstances. 
Meagher, Gummow
and Lehane, <i>Equity - Doctrines and Remedies</i>, 3rd Ed,
Butterworths, 1984 state:<br><i>&#8216;Why should a court grant urgent relief
when the plaintiff&#8217;s tardiness in applying for it casts doubt on the
reality of
his alleged injury?&#8217;  </i><br><br>The authors
state:<br><i>&#8216;Obviously if the delay is coupled with some such factor as
the intervention of third party rights or prejudice to the defendant,
an
interlocutory injunction should be refused just as a final injunction should be
refused.  But authority is not wanting that on
an interlocutory application -
where different principles apply from those which would be applicable on a final
hearing - mere delay
of itself can (not must) be fatal ...It is self-evident
that the stronger the defences apparently open to the defendant the less
chance
the plaintiff has of obtaining interlocutory relief.  Thus, in Hubbard v Vosper
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%202%20QB%2084" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] 2 QB 84</a> the fact that the defendant&#8217;s chances of making out a good
statutory defence of &#8220;fair dealing&#8221; seemed very strong
was probably
the biggest factor in inclining the court against enjoining what was otherwise
prima face a clear breach of copyright.
 Conversely, in Beecham Group Ltd v
Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1968/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1968] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281968%29%20118%20CLR%20618" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1968) 118 CLR 618</a> the fact that the defendants
advanced no very clear grounds of defence greatly contributed to the
plaintiff&#8217;s success.  But
it should not be imagined that if a court on an
interlocutory application inclines in the defendant&#8217;s favour it must
necessarily
refuse an injunction: an injunction can still lie to protect the
plaintiff&#8217;s property if he has a substantial case, some possibility
of
success, and there is lack of countervailing factors&#8217;.</i><br><br>[para

at 638 per Bowen CJ, Beaumont and Foster JJ]   <br><br>177   	The
present is par excellence the case in which, as it appears to me, the evidence
clearly makes plain that many of the substantial
complaints presently pursued by
the plaintiffs have in large measure been complaints of matters known to the
plaintiffs and of which
the plaintiffs have complained in considerable detail,
literally for years.  Whatever be the correct construction as a matter of
law
ultimately upheld by the Court in relation to the Consultancy Contract, both
parties have continued to regard the contract as
extant, neither seeking to
rescind the contract for alleged repudiation by the
other.<br><br>178   	To my mind there is much to be said for the
proposition that at least some of Mr Maconochie&#8217;s views of the contractual
obligations of each party are derived as much from his beliefs as to
pre-contractual communications, as they are from the written
words in the
contract.  However, at the end of the day, it is the express terms of the
contract, and in particular the Consultancy
Agreement, and of course any terms
which may be implied into that agreement by appropriate principles, which will
decide the case
insofar as it involves questions of contract.   The
pre-contractual Trade Practices representational case is altogether another case
expressly not put in aid of the Notice of Motion.
<br><br>179   	The relatively clear exposition by Mr Maconochie
on 20 August 1997 in PX 7/2909 [appended as Appendix &#8220;F&#8221; to the
judgment] of JMG&#8217;s view that ultimately, it did not matter as to what was
written down and necessarily who had legal control,
since a successful
enterprise &#8220;would always require the good faith of both parties for it to
work in the critical short to
medium term&#8221; suggests that Mr Maconochie saw
good faith as necessary to achieve what he apparently believed was to be
&#8220;a
balance between the dependencies on JMG&#8217;s unique skills and the
capital that would be required from the shareholder to establish
the business
and grow it&#8221;.  That this co-operative and confirmed interdependent
&#8220;joint venture&#8221; expectation appears
to have been in fact a shared
belief, appears from the Group Executive Committee Paper entitled &#8220;Electra
Investment Proposal&#8221;,
where the Bank&#8217;s objectives at PX 4356 are
expressed to include &#8220;retaining key individuals in a <u>joint venture
concept</u>&#8221; [and see PX 4401 - &#8220;The founders will be locked into a
long term management contract&#8221;.] [emphasis added]  Naturally,
the
admissibility of this Committee Paper will be determined on the final hearing,
where the Court will also take clause 1.4 of the
Consultancy Agreement into
account. That clause does not, however, exclude the existence of fiduciary
duties.  In an appropriate
case such duties may operate as a &#8220;default
mechanism&#8221;, supplying the ground rules of the relationship.  This is made
clear in Bean <i>Fiduciary Obligations and Joint Ventures - The Collaborative
Fiduciary Relationship</i>, Clarendon Press, 1995 at 70 in the following
passage:<br><br><i>&#8216;<b>2.	Recognising Fiduciary Duties in a Contractual
Context </b></i><br><br><i>The courts can recognise fiduciary duties if they are
express terms or necessarily implied terms; also if a term is ambiguous it can
be construed as fiduciary, where the purpose of the relationship indicates that
it is fiduciary.  Thus a fiduciary relationship may
be considered to exist
concurrently with the contract&#8217;s terms and to supplement them or fill some
gap in the contractual matrix.</i><br><br><i>Earlier we noted the view of Lord
Wilberforce [New Zealand Netherlands Society  v Kuys [1973] 2 All ER 1222 at
1225-1226] and others
that any fiduciary relationships or duties must be moulded
to fit within any contractual framework and not contradict any terms of
the
contract.  In a fiduciary relationship created by contract the supremacy of the
contact&#8217;s terms can be considered to make
fiduciary law a &#8220;default
scheme of regulation&#8221;. [R Flannagan, Fiduciary Obligation in the Supreme
Court (1990) 54 Sask
LR 45].  As Mason J stated:</i><br><br><i>&#8220;<u>The
fiduciary relationship, if it is to exist at all, must accommodate itself to the
terms of the contract so that it is consistent
with, and conforms to, them</u>.
The fiduciary relationship cannot be superimposed upon the contract in such a
way as to alter the operation which the contract was
intended to have according
to its true interpretation.  [Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical
Corporation <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 156 CLR 41</a> at 97]</i><br><br><i>Thus in recognizing fiduciary
duties the courts must give effect to the contract, and in a contract the
parties&#8217; intentions
are paramount.  Thus any fiduciary duty must not
contradict the parties&#8217; intentions, but rather must fulfil those
intentions.
 The role of fiduciary law is then to supplement express terms and
explain ambiguous terms.  <u>In a fiduciary relationship it is a &#8220;default
mechanism&#8221;, supplying the ground rules of the
relationship&#8217;</u>.</i><br>	<br>[Emphasis added]
<br><br>180   	The conflict of actual operating objectives
between the Bank&#8217;s group traditional businesses and AUSMAQ&#8217;s
operating
objectives was said in this memorandum by Mr Maconochie back in August
1997 to be the root of the problem, it being there suggested
that at the outset
this type of problem was recognised &#8220;by setting up the National Markets
Group as an entity operated independently
of the traditional business&#8221;. 
<br><br>181   	There does not appear to be any express term in
the Consultancy Agreement which explicitly recognises that the National Markets
Group would be an entity operated independently of the traditional business. 
The defendants contend that the plaintiffs&#8217; construction
would violate the
accepted position that the ultimate control of a corporate entity is vested in
its Board of Directors. <br><br><b>Application for Receivership Orders
Rejected</b><br><br>182   	To my mind the granting of the relief
sought by the plaintiffs in terms of the appointment of receivers and managers
is out
of the question in this case.  As has already been pointed out, the
appointment of a receiver is an extraordinary and drastic remedy
to be exercised
with utmost care and caution and only where the Court is satisfied that there is
imminent danger of loss if it is
not exercised.  There is ample authority for
the proposition that the Court will not usually assume the management of a
business
or undertaking except with a view to its winding-up and sale as a going
concern so that with the sale the management ends.  When
the Court appoints a
manager of a business or undertaking, it in effect takes the management of it
into its own hands; the manager
or receiver and manager is of course an officer
of the court.  Managers who have been appointed by the Court are responsible to
the
court and can have no regard to orders of any of the parties interested in
the business - &#8220;Kerr on Receivers&#8221; 14th ed
at p
219.<br><br>183   	Receivers and managers appointed by the Court
are personally liable to persons dealing with them in respect of liabilities
incurred or contracts entered into by them in carrying on the business unless
the express terms of the contract exclude, as they
may do, personal
liability.<br><br>184   	It is to my mind inconceivable that the
Court could appoint a receiver and manager of NMG and the NMG Group, or of the
assets
of the NAB, NAFM and the NAB Group, the subject of the initial orders in
the motion.  For one thing, the period during which the
receiver and manager
would be in place is likely to be extended.  For another thing, the dynamic
nature of the subject business is
such, and the industry is such, that in effect
the appointment of the receiver and manager would place the Court in an
invidious
position where one might anticipate very similar differences of
opinion as have in the past separated the parties to the proceeding
arising in
relation to the future conduct of the business.  Further, the very fact of the
appointment is likely to significantly
erode confidence in the AUSMAQ
service.<br><br>185   	Mr Garnsey submitted that a receiver and
manager of NMG would simply be expected to cause NMG to comply with the
Consultancy
Agreement and to require that the business of the company be managed
by a management committee to meet regularly and to be entitled
to be heard and
present at such meeting the two nominated representatives of JMG, albeit that
they could not vote.  Mr Garnsey&#8217;s
submission is that the business would
go forward under the aegis of the receiver and manager and managed by such
management committee.
 His submission was that there would not be anticipated
any particular difficulties such as continued court supervision over the
activities of the receiver and manager and of
NMG.<br><br>186   	To my mind these submissions are without
substance, bearing in mind the nature of the AUSMAQ service, and bearing in mind
the
history of the difficulties between the parties as evidenced by the
correspondence and meetings and matters earlier set out in the
judgment.  The
receiver and manager is likely to be caught squarely in the middle of a
continued competition as between Mr Maconochie
and JMG on the one part, and the
Bank and its interests on the other part, as to the appropriate way forward for
NMG. <br><br>187   	The appointment of a receiver and manager to
NMG would it seems to me be far more prejudicial to the interests of both
parties
than for NMG to be simply managed by a management committee to meet
regularly and upon which NMG&#8217;s representatives would have
a right to be
heard, although not a voting right.  Clearly questions arise as to whether the
Court ought, by order, oblige the parties
to hold such management committee
meetings.  The issue is dealt with below.  Such a committee would not be
responsible to an officer
of the court for its determination as to NMG&#8217;s
way forward and business operations.  Although such a committee may also be
expected to have to weather personality differences, and differences as to
NMG&#8217;s way forward as between the JMG representatives
on the one part, and
other management committee members on the other part, at the end of the day the
theory behind the Consultancy
Agreement that the two groups would have a common
interest, but that the management committee itself, excluding JMG&#8217;s
nominated
representatives, would have voting rights to determine NMG&#8217;s way
forward, would be being followed.  [I emphasise that in so
referring to the
&#8220;theory behind the Consulting Agreement&#8221;, I well recognise that this
represents an interim view as to
such being a correct analysis of the Agreement
read in context and read in full.  Suffice it to say that in my view the
plaintiffs
have established a serious case for trial to the effect that on a
final hearing, this view of the contract will be
accepted.]<br><br>188   	The relief sought in the paragraphs of
the amended notice of motion, seeking application of appointment of Receivers
and Managers,
will not be granted.<br><br><b>Serious
case</b><br><br>189   	There are effectively three crucial
matters which require to be examined in relation to the &#8220;serious
case&#8221; issue.
 Each also bears upon the proper approach to the balance of
convenience.  These are:<br><br>(1)	The contractual obligations of the parties -
those require a view to be expressed, albeit not a final view, as to the proper
construction
of the Consulting Agreement;<br><br>(2)	JMG&#8217;s fiduciary
obligation case;<br><br>(3)	JMG&#8217;s functionality case.<br><br>It is
appropriate to deal with these matters seriatim.<br><b>The Proper Construction
of the Consultancy Agreement</b><br><br>190   	It is not
appropriate on this interlocutory application for the Court to form a concluded
and final opinion upon questions
of law, and in particular upon the questions of
law involved in the respective contentions as to the proper construction of the
Consultancy
Agreement.  The Court is, however, entitled if the nature of the
case requires this as a matter of discretion, to form a considered
view upon
such matters.<br><b>The Management
Committee</b><br><br>191   	The Consulting Agreement used the
words &#8220;management committee&#8221; in two places only - clause 4.1 (a) and
clause 9.3
 On each occasion, the phrase used is &#8220;management committee of
the Company [NMG]&#8221;.<br><br>192   	Clause 4 of the Agreement
deals with &#8220;Business Plans&#8221;.<br><br>193   	Save for
the reference in sub clause 4.1(a) to &#8220;management committee of the
Company&#8221;, the remaining sub clauses
[4.1(b), 4.1(c), 4.2, 4.3] all refer
to &#8220;the Company&#8221;.<br><br>194   	The sole express
reference to the functions which the management committee of NMG is to be
charged with is to be found in clause
4.1 (a) which requires that JMG and the
management committee meet at the identified time or times for the purpose which
is specified.
 The time or times of such meeting or meetings is to be at least
90 days before the end of the financial year or at such other times
as may be
agreed by &#8220;the Company [NMG]&#8221; and JMG.  Again I note the use in the
first sentence of clause 4.1 (a) of the
words &#8220;the Company&#8221; in
contradiction to the use in the same sentence of the words &#8220;the management
committee of
the Company&#8221;.<br><br>195   	The purpose of the
meeting or meetings to take place between JMG and the management committee is
&#8220;to review the objectives
of the Group regarding the operation,
development and commercialisation of the AUSMAQ Service throughout the
world&#8221;.<br><br>196   	Clause 4.1 (b) clearly explains the
timing device stipulated in sub clause (a).  Save with respect to the initial
Business
Plan [as to which special arrangements are made to accommodate the fact
that the agreement was anticipated to come into operation
following the end of
the 1996 financial year], the parties intended that JMG would have at least 30
days in which to carry out a
specified task.  [I avoid using the word
&#8220;service&#8221; without intending to deal with the issue raised and dealt
with below,
as to the meaning to be given for the word &#8220;services&#8221; as
used in clause 3.1.]  The specified task required JMG to deliver
a document [and
plainly to prepare, whether or not using or modifying in that task of
preparation, materials, if any, furnished to
it by the management committee
during the meeting or meetings convened required by clause 4.1 (a)].  The
document to be delivered
was to be a draft &#8220;of the proposed Business Plan
regarding the development of the AUSMAQ Service by the Group for the immediately
following financial year&#8221;.  Such draft would plainly be a &#8220;proposed
Business Plan&#8221; within the meaning of Clause
4.2 and therefore was required
to include each of the matters referred to in sub paragraphs (a) to (f) of
paragraph 4.2.<br><br>197   	A close examination of the matters
referred to in sub paragraphs (a) to (f) of paragraph 4.2 throws light upon the
nature,
extent and width of the information required to be made available to JMG
in order that it be in a position to discharge its clause
4.1(b) obligation to
produce a draft proposed Business Plan.  Plainly, JMG would have had to be made 
aware, before being able to
produce such proposed Business Plan for any given
year, of:<br><br>(i)	Detail of what had been the objectives and milestones set
out in the immediately preceding Business Plan (which may have remained
unaltered through the current year, or during that year been amended  - [see the
last paragraph of clause 4.2].<br><br>(ii)	Detail of what had been the actual
objectives achieved by the Group in the immediately preceding Business Plan, or
altered Business
Plan;<br><br>(iii)	Information necessary to enable JMG to
reconcile the planned objectives with the objectives
achieved;<br><br>(iv)	Information necessary to enable JMG to determine what may
have been reasons why any objectives were exceeded or not met [this
information
was needed by JMG so as to permit it to be able to state whether or not there
were <u>identifiable</u> reasons why objectives were exceeded or not met, so as
to permit JMG to state what any such identifiable reasons were];<br><br>(v)	What
were the objectives of the Group for the relevant financial year
regarding:<br><br>(a)	the operation of the AUSMAQ service throughout the
world;<br><br>(b)	the development of the AUSMAQ service throughout the
world;<br><br>(c)	the commercialisation of the AUSMAQ service through the
world;<br><br>(vi)	What were the estimated:<br>	<br>(a)	capital costs involved
in meeting these objectives;<br>	<br>(b)	personnel requirements involved in
meeting those objectives;<br>	<br>(c)	equipment requirements involved in meeting
those objectives;<br><br>(vii)	estimated reserves;<i> </i><br><br>(viii)	the
involvement proposed by JMG in meeting those reserves;<br><br>(ix)	the estimated
hours required by each of those consultants [in the endeavour to enable
JMG&#8217;s proposed involvement in meeting
those objectives, to be
achieved].<br><br>198   	The extent of JMG&#8217;s perceived
involvement during the window of opportunity [possibly a window limited to 30
days] in
which to prepare a proposed Business Plan, is thus clear from the
nature of the detail enunciated by clause 4.2.<br><br>199   	In
my view it is clearly open to a trial judge to hold that an understanding of how
the parties anticipated that JMG could
be expected to discharge its clause
4.1(b) functions may be found at a number of points within the Agreement.  Hence
it is open to
a trial judge to find as follows:<br><br>(1)	Clause 9.3 was to
entitle JMG by two appointed representatives [to be from the pool of defined
&#8216;Consultants&#8217;] to attend
and to be <u>heard</u> at all meetings of
the management committee.  This suggested that such meetings would occur
regularly and that the management committee
would have a management function
with respect to the Company&#8217;s business.  This is not to suggest that,
properly construed,
the Agreement required that the Board of Directors of the
Company abdicate its functions to the Committee.  It simply suggests that
the
management committee was, subject to appropriate Board overseeship, to manage
the business of the company, which business so
managed, was to be carried out in
accordance with the Business Plans from time to time adopted by the company in
accordance with
the carefully structured and defined set of procedures set out
in clause 4.  The Board of Directors was bound to procure compliance
by NMG with
the provisions of the Consultancy Agreement, hence permitting the management
committee to meet and to permit the JMG
representatives the right to be heard.
<i>	</i><br><br>(2)	The parties anticipated that JMG was to be involved in
meeting the Group&#8217;s objectives - see clause 4.2(e).  See also the
regime
stipulated in clauses 5; 6, 7 and 10.  See also the JMG software warranties
provided for in clause 11.4 and the JMG indemnity
provided for in clause
11.5.<br><br>200   	Earlier in the judgment I referred to
JMG&#8217;s case that its entitlement to participate at all meetings of the
management
committee of NMG in the fashion provided for in clause 9.3 of the
Consultancy Agreement and its entitlement as said to be provided
for in clause
4.1(a), to meet with the management committee of NMG at least 90 days before the
end of the financial year (or at such
other time as agreed by NMG and JMG),
&#8216;to review the objectives of [NMG and Ausmaq Systems] regarding the
operation, development
and commercialisation of the Ausmaq Service throughout
the world&#8217;, were (a) fundamental terms of the Agreement and (b) terms
which were inserted for the purpose of recognising the special interest of JMG
[and through it Mr Maconochie], in the worldwide operation,
development and
commercialisation of the Ausmaq service and in being able to speak to and play a
real part in the management committee&#8217;s
deliberations and decisions.  In
my view, the plaintiffs have established a serious case to be tried to the
effect that the Consultancy
Agreement, upon its proper construction, obliged NMG
to hold regular Management Committee Meetings so as to permit JMG by its
nominated
representatives to keep abreast of:<br>(a)	the activities, present and
proposed, of the AUSMAQ Service, and by definition, of NMG&#8217;s directions in
that regard;<br>(b)	the content of Business Plans in place regarding the
development of the AUSMAQ service by the Group;<br>(c)	the actual performance of
the Group in meeting the objectives set by the Business
Plan.<br>201   	In short, the plaintiffs have established a
reasonable prospect that the Court on the final hearing will
hold:<br><br>(a)	That the vehicle selected by the parties for the participation
by both JMG and NMG in the further development of the AUSMAQ service
by the
Group, was the requirement that Business Plans be prepared and that Management
Committee Meetings be held to deal, subject
to appropriate Board overseeship,
with the business of the Company.  <br><br>(b)	That business, so managed, was to
be carried out in accordance with the Business Plans in place from time to
time.<br><br>202   	I refer to NMG&#8217;s submission that clause
4.1(a) of the Consultancy Agreement should be construed as if
read:<br><br><i>&#8216;At least 90 days before the end of the financial year or
at such other time as agreed by the Company and JMG, JMG and the management
committee of the Company will meet to review <u>such objectives, if any, as the
Group may have</u> regarding the operation, development and commercialisation of
the AUSMAQ service throughout the world&#8217;.	</i>[emphasis
added]<br><br>203   	A very respectable case has been presented
by JMG to the effect that on a final hearing the Court will hold that the
purport
of the whole of the Agreement is the clear acceptance by the parties
that the Group&#8217;s objectives were to operate, develop and
commercialise the
AUSMAQ Service throughout the world and to carry out such steps as were
reasonably practicable in that regard.<br><br><b>The
&#8220;Services&#8221;</b><br><br>204   	The second line of
clause 3.1 of the Business Plan includes the words &#8220;including any Business
Plan&#8221;, in parenthesis.
 The draftsman could have adopted the device of
avoiding that parenthesis and of instead including a sub clause amongst the sub
clauses
(a) to (g) to read:<br><br>&#8220; - preparation of draft Business
Plans&#8221;.<br><br>205   	The plaintiffs have established a
reasonable case that the proper construction of the Agreement, which will be
upheld on the
final hearing, will be that at the least, and without any
ascription to JMG by an authorised officer of NMG of any obligation to
perform
any particular services, JMG has a contractual right to the strict compliance by
NMG with the provisions of clauses 4.1 and
4.2.<br><b>System IP

bases contended for</u>.</i><br><br><i>(D)	In relation to the implication of
&#8220;management&#8221; aspects in the express or implied terms relied upon,
the Applicants
also refer to Maconochie First Statement para 10.4. Mr McKinnon
of NAB said on 6 August 1996 (inter alia):</i><br><br><i>&#8220;The Bank does
not have the people and the organisation to figure out and build a system like
the AUSMAQ.   Even if it did,
it couldn&#8217;t run
it&Eacute;&#8221;.</i><br><br><i>(E)	In the case of divisions of NAB and its
subsidiaries which do not have a separate legal personality, they fall within
the definition
of the term &#8220;Operating Entity&#8221; being
&#8220;entities&#8221; properly described as such.   The term
&#8220;entity&#8221;
is used and has been interpreted in revenue law, industrial
law and in securities law as including unincorporated organisations or
committees or associations of persons which do not have a separate legal
personality.   The term is used in these contexts precisely
because it catches
entities which do not have a separate legal personality.   See, for instance,
the definition of &#8220;entity&#8221;

financial reporting: <b>Section 294A(4)(5)</b>.   See also:  Australian Breeders

Contentions</b><br><br>208   	The defendants contend
that:<br><br><i>&#8216;The phrase &#8220;System IP Rights&#8221; in the
Consulting Agreement means (in substance) the intellectual property received
by
NMG under the Restructuring Agreement and any developments of that intellectual
property&#8217;.</i><br><br>209   	The submission is that it does
not mean the intellectual property in any service anywhere in Australia or
throughout the world
which is equivalent or similar to the service known as
&#8220;AUSMAQ System&#8221;.<br><br>210   	The defendants&#8217;
argument follows a close examination of the definitions in the Restructuring
Agreement and is as follows:<br><br><i>&#8216;(a)	&#8220;System IP Rights&#8221;
in the Consulting Agreement &#8220;means</i> <i>the Intellectual and Industrial
Property in the software .... used to provide the Ausmaq Service.&#8221; 
</i><br><br><i>(b)	The definition of &#8220;Ausmaq Service&#8221; provides that
Ausmaq Service &#8220;means the service of providing an automated
securities
trading system and related services known as the Australian Market Automated
Quotation System or Ausmaq System or Euromaq
regardless of its name&#8221;.  The
&#8220;System IP Rights&#8221; must therefore be intellectual and industrial
property in software
used to provide that service.   </i><br><br><i>(c)	The
definitions of &#8220;System IP Rights&#8221; and &#8220;Ausmaq Service&#8221;
are, for all relevant purposes, in the same
terms in the Consulting Agreement
and the Restructuring Agreement.  These definitions should be construed
consistently in both agreements.</i><br><br><i>(d)	Under the Restructuring
Agreement, Market Holdings </i><br><br><i>(i)	warranted to NMG that it had full
power to transfer good legal and equitable title to  the &#8220;System IP

5.2.40)</i><br><br><i>(ii)	transferred its right title and
interest in the &#8220;System IP Rights&#8221; to NMG (cl

definitions of &#8220;System IP Rights&#8221; and &#8220;Ausmaq Service&#8221;
are
read consistently in both agreements, </i><br><br><i>(i)	the effect of the
warranty in 5.2.40 of the Restructuring Agreement would have been that Market
Holdings warranted that it had
full power to transfer the legal and equitable
title to the intellectual property in the software used to provide any service
with
equivalent or similar functionality to the service known as Ausmaq System; 
(this would have included any such service anywhere throughout
the world); and
</i><br><br><i>(ii)	Market Holdings would have been obliged to transfer that
intellectual property to NMG;</i><br><br><i>(iii)	from the moment of completion
of the Restructuring Agreement, NMG would have been required to pay performance
bonuses by reference

of equivalent or similar functionality to the Ausmaq

parties&#8217;.  </i><br><br>211   	It is strictly unnecessary
for the Court to express a firm view on these opposing contentions.  To my mind
however the plaintiffs
have shown that a serious question is raised by their
construction seen as part of the whole of the Consultancy Agreement and the
surrounding circumstances in the form of mutually known facts being part of the
objective setting in which the contract is to be
construed.  On the other hand,
the Court on the final hearing may well construe the above described warranty so
as to exclude the
extension suggested in the words in parenthesis in sub
paragraph (e)(i) above. <br><br>212   	The plaintiffs have in my
view, established a serious case for trial in support of their claims that the
Consulting Agreement
included the following as express, or partly express and
partly implied, terms:<br><br><i>(a)	&#8216;That JMG was entitled to the
continued representation by two representatives with deliberative but not voting

prepare and discuss the annual Business Plan&#8217;.</i><br><br>	<br>		[Points

proposition of Lord Blackburn in <i>Mackay v Dick </i>(1880-1881) 6 AC 251 at
263 to support the terms pleaded in paragraphs 18.1 and 18.2.  That proposition,
described as a &#8220;rule
of construction&#8221; by Mason J in <i>Secured

144 CLR 596</a> at 607-608 is in the following terms:<br><br><i>&#8216;I think I may
safely say, as a general rule, that where in a written contract it appears that
both parties have agreed that
something shall be done, which cannot effectually
be done unless both concur in doing it, the construction of the contract is that
each agrees to do all that is necessary to be done on his part for the carrying
out of that thing, though there may be no express
words to that effect.  What is
the part of each must depend in circumstances&#8217;.</i><br>	<br>		[Cf <i>Byrne

as are necessary
on his part to enable the other party to have the benefit of
the contract&#8217;.</i><br><br>217   	This latter quotation
makes clear that the <i>McKay v Dick </i>rule of construction is not confined to
the imposition of an obligation on one contracting party to co-operate in doing
all that is
necessary to be done for the performance by the other party of his
obligations under the contract.<br><br><i>[per Mason J - Secured Income Real

at 607<i>]</i><br><br>218   	As Mason J points out in <i>Secured
Income:</i><br><br><i>&#8216;It is easy to imply a duty to co-operate in the
doing of acts which are necessary to the performance by the parties or by one
of
the parties of fundamental obligations under the contract.  It is not quite so
easy to make the implication when the acts in question
are necessary to entitle
the other contracting party to a benefit under the contract but are not
essential to the performance of
that party&#8217;s obligations and are not
fundamental to the contract.  Then the question arises whether the contract
imposes a
duty to co-operate on the first party or whether it leaves him at
liberty to decide for himself whether the act shall be done, even
if the
consequence of his decision is to disentitle the other party to a benefit.  In
such a case, the correct interpretation of
the contract depends ... not so much
on the application on the general rule of construction as on the intention of
the parties as
manifested by the contract
itself&#8217;.</i><br><br>219   	The terms pleaded in paragraphs
18.3 and 18.5 are said to be grounded upon <i>Trego v Hunt </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1896%5d%20AC%207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1896] AC 7</a> and
upon <i>Codelfa Construction </i>[supra].  In <i>Trego v Hunt, </i>Lord
Macnaghten said at 25:<br><br><i>&#8216;... A man may not derogate form his own
grant; the vendor is not at liberty to destroy or depreciate the thing which he
has
sold; there is an implied covenant, on the sale of goodwill, that the vendor
does not solicit the custom which he has parted with:
it would be a fraud on the
contract to do so.  These, as it seems to me, are only different turns and
glimpses of a proposition which
I take to be elementary.  It is not right to
profess and to purport to sell that which you do not mean the purchaser to have;
it
is not an honest thing to pocket the price and then to recapture the subject
of sale; to decoy it away or call it back before the
purchaser has had time to
attach it to himself and make it his very
own&#8217;.</i><br><br>220   	The law also implies a negative
covenant not to hinder or prevent to fulfilment of the purpose of an express
covenant.

relationship the plaintiffs had with NMG and the NAB is one which arose out of
the purchase of the AUSMAQ system in 1996
and was defined, in particular, by the
Consulting Agreement;<br><br>(b)	that the result of the completion of the
transactions in November 1996 was to place the Bank and NMG in a position where
they
assumed control of the AUSMAQ system and its ability to make profits and
thus affect the payment of the performance bonus to the
plaintiffs;<br><br>(c)	that the Bank and NMG thus are in a position to affect
the interests of the plaintiff in both a legal and a practical
sense;<br><br>(d)	that the plaintiffs are vulnerable to abuse of that power;

These are:<br><br>(i)	<i>&#8216;As Deane J made clear in Hospital Products Ltd v
United States Surgical Corporation, the reason commercial transactions often
do
not give rise to a fiduciary relationship or fiduciary duties is that factually
they do not satisfy the relevant criteria for
the establishment of such
relationships or duties.  But to draw a distinction between commercial
transactions and other transactions
can cause a court to be misled, for it is
the presence of the relevant facts not the commercial nature of the transaction
that is
important&#8217;.</i><br>[at 54]<i> </i><br><br>(ii)	<i>&#8216;In the
commercial world the parties are often at arm&#8217;s length, which means they
are independent of each other.  In LAC

fiduciary relationships does not ordinarily apply to parties involved in
commercial negotiations
because they are at arm&#8217;s length [LAC Minerals at

Mooregate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd, a case where a licensor claimed

intimate in nature than franchises, licensing arrangements are similar to the
franchises discussed in Jirna.  The
approach taken by the court in Moorgate
Tobacco showed a sophistication notably absent in Jirna.  The High Court of
Australia found
no fiduciary duties existed because (1) the relationship was not
similar to partnership and agency, and (2) <u>the terms of the contract did not
generally, or in regard to a specific matter, require one party to pursue the
other&#8217;s interests
without regard to its own</u>.  The court did not take
refuge in the false conclusion that commercial parties at arm&#8217;s length do
not create fiduciary duties
or relationships in their
dealings&#8217;.</i>	<br><i>		</i>[at 58]<i>		</i>[emphasis
added]<br><br>(iv)	<i>&#8216;... the recognition of fiduciary duties in
partnership and agency (which are established by contract) indicates that
specification
of fiduciary duties is not necessary in commercial relationships. 
There is no duty to specify any particular duty in an agreement,
nor a duty to
spell out whether or not one party undertakes to act in another&#8217;s
interests or their joint interest.  Fiduciary
duties cannot be excluded by an
argument analogous to contributory negligence&#8217;.</i>	<br><i>		</i>[at

because the relationships created are usually antagonistic in nature:
whether a
party protects itself or not objectively each party serves its own interest.

CLR 1.</a>  In this case one party to the transaction, SPC, gave a mortgage over
land to be used for the joint project to another party, UDC.
 The mortgage
contained a collateralization clause which gave UDC the right to claim the
proceeds of sale of the land to offset SPC&#8217;s
other debts.  This deprived
the other party, Brian, of its share of the proceeds of the sale of the land,
that is the fruits of the
venture.  Brian and its co-contracting parties were at
arm&#8217;s length in the sense of being independent of each other.  They
were
experienced commercial parties.  They had legal advisers [Cf Gummow J in Elders

to protect themselves in the negotiations for the formal agreements that were
drawn up.  All the factors set out
by Gibbs CJ, Sopinka J, Kennedy J, and others
for denying a fiduciary relationship existed.  Mahoney JA in the NSW Court of
Appeal
explicitly noted that Brian, through its advisers, had an opportunity to
consider the mortgage.  In this sense Brian failed to protect
itself by not
requiring the collateralization clause to be removed or excluding its share from
the operation of the clause.</i><br><br><i>However the High Court held the
parties were partners and a fiduciary relationship existed, rendering the clause
unenforceable.  The
NSW Court of Appeal considered that the parties were joint
venturers and a fiduciary relationship existed.  Brian&#8217;s failure
to
protect itself did not prevent the court recognizing a fiduciary duty of
disclosure of material facts.  The failure of other contracting
parties to draw
attention to the unusual nature of the collateralization clause and obtain
consent to it was a breach of that fiduciary
duty.  The failure occurred at the
negotiation stage.  Brian&#8217;s lawyers could have investigated the documents
for unusual clauses
but their failure to do so, and the failure of Brian to
protect itself, did not destroy the fiduciary duties.</i><br><br><i>Why?  To
state that the answer is &#8220;because they had entered into a
partnership&#8221; is to miss the point. The answer is that
<u>the facts
indicated that it was reasonable to expect that the parties had to act in their
joint</u> <u>interest and not for their own interest</u>.  What facts were
these?  The facts were that the object of the relationship would be defeated if
the breach (i.e., the collateralization
clause) were allowed to stand.  The
object of the relationship in Brian was mutual profit to be divided among the
parties.  The collateralization
clause prevented Brian receiving its share of
the mutual profit&#8217;.</i><br>[at 62-63]		[emphasis

AUSMAQ service.]<br><br>228   	The evidence of Mr Maconochie was
objected to on the basis that he was not appropriately qualified to give
evidence as an expert.
 The admissibility issue is dealt with
below.<br><br>229   	In Mr Maconochie&#8217;s second statement
[paragraph 8 and following] he compares the functionality of the AUSMAQ Service
and
of the above described actual or projected Bank services, with a view to
determining whether each of those services is a service
with equivalent or
similar functionality to the AUSMAQ service.  His methodologies are set out in
his statements.  The results of
his analyses and conclusions are set out in the
tables annexed to his statements, in particular in table 2 annexed to his second
statement entitled &#8220;Functionality Comparison Table&#8221; and in table 1
entitled &#8220;Division and Strategy
Comparison&#8221;.<br><br>230   	In Mr Maconochie&#8217;s second
statement in paragraph 8.3 he identifies the characteristics of the Bank&#8217;s
services earlier
referred to.  His conclusions as to functionality are set out
at p 74 and following of his second statement.  His ultimate conclusion
in
paragraph 9 of his second statement is that each of the above described Bank
services, namely the Gateway Service, the Automated
Lending Service and FX Auto
Dealing Service, &#8220;is a service with the equivalent or similar
functionality to the AUSMAQ service&#8221;.
 The motion no longer seeks relief
with respect to the Remote Wealth Service.  Mr Maconochie expresses the view
that &#8220;the strategy
and objectives of the four projects, and the e-commerce
activities of the group, are common to the AUSMAQ
service&#8221;.<br><br>231   	The functionality comparisons are
furthered in Mr Maconochie&#8217;s third statement which also includes a
functionality comparison
of the AUSMAQ service with the Maple Leaf service and
the Independence One service.  No relief is pressed with respect to the
Independence
One Service.  The results of those analyses are set out in Mr
Maconochie&#8217;s third statement and in the tables appended to that
statement.<br><br>232   	Mr Maconochie&#8217;s ultimate
conclusion with respect to project Maple Leaf is set out in paragraphs 11, 12
and 13 of his
third statement, his conclusion being relevantly that project
Maple Leaf &#8220;is a service with equivalent or similar functionality
to the
AUSMAQ service&#8221;, and that &#8220;the strategy and objectives of [that
project], and the e-commerce activities of the
Bank that [it] represent(s) is
common to the AUSMAQ service&#8221;.<br><br>233   	In paragraph
5.2 of Mr Maconochie&#8217;s second statement, he defines the word
&#8220;functionality&#8221; as used by him
in his statements in relation to the
AUSMAQ service.  That definition deals with several sub parameters,
namely:<br><br>(a)	the nature of the service;<br><br>(b)	the quality of the
service;<br><br>(c)	its practical capabilities and capacities;<br><br>(d)	the
configuration of the above into a market able to deliver defined benefits to the
market participants.<br><br>The full definition is set out
below.<br><br>234   	The AUSMAQ service is referred to in detail
from paragraphs 6.1 and following in Mr Maconochie&#8217;s second statement
insofar
as its purpose, nature and functions are
concerned.<br><br>235   	In setting out his mode of comparing the
functionality of the AUSMAQ service, and the actual or projected Bank services,
Mr
Maconochie in paragraph 8.2 of his second statement gives evidence that the
table he compiled:<br><br><i>&#8220;listed the 24 functional categories which
comprise all the main functions done, or which are planned to be done, by the
AUSMAQ
service.  </i><br><br><i>The table included planned, enhancements,
modifications and additions that had been identified in the Business Plans for
NMG and AUSMAQ
and previously, which I identified with an E.</i><br><br><i>The
functions in this table were based on my knowledge of the AUSMAQ service, the
Business Plans for NMG and AUSMAQ, and the documents
referred to in this
statement and included in the production specification.  The AUSMAQ production
system is a flexible platform
and was so designed to enable the AUSMAQ service
to have additions and enhancements readily made to it to meet the future needs
of
the market.  Such future enhancement, modifications and additions were to be
specified by JMG in the future Business Plans JMG delivered
in accordance with
the Consulting Agreement&#8217;.  </i><br><br>236   	On pp 66-67
of his second statement, Mr Maconochie refers to the notations E for
enhancements, modifications and additions,
stating as
follows:<br><br><i>&#8216;All of these enhancements, modifications and additions
have been planned and most of them have been specified, some to a higher
level
than others.  Several, for example, items 1.1.1 and 1.3.5, have been partially
built but not yet released.  The share trading
capabilities of the production
system exist but have never been used.  The real time issue of units to the
AUSMAQ managed fund and
deposit market also exist but have never been
used&#8217;.</i><br><br>237   	Also on p 67 of Mr
Maconochie&#8217;s second statement, with reference to the modifications,
enhancements and additions, to
which he is referring, he gives evidence as
follows:<br><br><i>&#8216;The rationale for including each of the above items of
functionality in the production system in the future was to satisfy
the needs of
market participants by having a complete market value-proposition that is
difficult for competitors to match, thereby
providing the substance for future
marketing efforts to meet the strategic objectives of the AUSMAQ service as
enunciated in the
1997, 1998 and 1999 Business Plans and to commercialising the
AUSMAQ service, globally, as rapidly as possible.  These aspects were
described
in detail in the 1997 and subsequent Business Plans prepared by JMG.  All of
these modifications, enhancements and additions
were planned prior to the
involvement of NAB and were so recognised in NAB&#8217;s Due Diligence report of
July 1996.  All were subsequently
included in the NMG/AUSMAQ Business Plans. 
They are relatively simple and straightforward additions to
implement&#8217;.</i><br><br><b>The Challenge to Mr Maconochie&#8217;s

 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=293%20F%201013" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">293 F 1013</a> (1923)].  The Frye test had required that an expert's opinion be
related to a recognised field of expertise or result from the application
of
theories or techniques accepted in that field.<br><br>243   	It
is important to note that an expert witness should not be allowed to stray
outside the witness' area of expertise.  It is
for this reason that the opinion
expressed by the witness must be based wholly or substantially on the witness'
specialised knowledge,

assess the reliability of the knowledge and experience on
which the opinion was based.  A question may be suggested as arising as
to
whether a similar exercise is required under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence

not enter the difficult field of determining what were the criteria which were
required

that
there be no field of expertise test.  The Commission's position was
that:<br><i>". . . there will be available the general discretion to exclude

Perpetual Trustees WA Limited</i>, (unreported, Supreme Court of New South
Wales, McLelland CJ in Equity, 18 September 1996), his Honour dealt with an
objection to
a report purporting to be an expert's report.  The objection was
based substantially on the ground that the matters in respect of
which the
expert purported to express opinions in his report, comprised or included
matters going beyond a field of expertise in
which the expert had been shown to
be qualified to give opinion evidence.<br><br>249   	McLelland CJ
in Equity dealt with the matter as follows: <br>(a)	by first defining the extent
to which the expert had been shown to have specialised knowledge based on his
training and experience;<br><br>(b)	by then identifying, by description, the
matters upon which the expert was qualified to express opinions;<br><br>(c)	by
holding, in relation to opinions expressed in the report going beyond those
descriptions, that assuming, without deciding,

under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 79</a>, they would not be admitted in the exercise of the court's

regard to the form of the report, to physically sever the opinions from those
which should not be admitted, counsel were invited by the court to agree that
certain sections of the report before his Honour should
be admitted, possibly
with an appropriate qualification by way of a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s136.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 136</a>

Submissions</b><br><br>252   	The defendant&#8217;s submission
was that Mr Maconochie has not been shown to have the expertise to express
opinions, about
either the functionality of the AUSMAQ service, or the
functionality of the Bank&#8217;s proposed services.  The submission was that
Mr
Maconochie was not shown to have expertise to express opinions as to whether the
Bank projects were similar to the system known
as the AUSMAQ system.  The
submission was that there was no evidence that Mr Maconochie had had experience
in the industry of automated
trading services, and on the evidence that Mr
Maconochie gave, that his involvement was with the development of the AUSMAQ
service,
but not of experience in general banking industry.  The submission was
that there was no evidence that Mr Maconochie had any experience
in software
writing or information technology in a technical sense.  Hence, the
defendant&#8217;s submission was that Mr Maconochie
is not shown to have
relevant experience in the industry in respect of which he is purporting to
express opinions, and in particular
had no experience in the general banking
area with which the banking projects here in consideration were concerned.  The
submission
was that in order for an expert to qualify within the words of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a>
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>, </i>it was necessary that the witness be shown to have
experience in the relevant industry, and here to be familiar with automated
trading
systems and to have training, study or experience in relation to the
operations of banks.<br><br>253   	Mr Maconochie has a Bachelor
of Engineering (Mech. Eng Honours) Melbourne University 1968.  From 1969 to 1977
he was employed
by Esso Australia Limited and during that period worked on the
exploration and development of the Bass Strait oil and gas field.

<br><br>254   	In  1976 and 1977 Mr Maconochie worked as a senior
engineer in the 3 person Planning and Evaluation section of Esso&#8217;s
production department, undertaking the commercial evaluation of gas plant No. 3
at Longford, the Schnapper Gas Platform Commercial
Assessment and Budget
submission and various oil and gas pipeline proposals.  He took several courses
given by Esso production research
company in the analytical techniques of
profitability, analysis and computer simulations of commercial appraisal.  He
was also selected
for a drilling and production engineering training course with
an oil and refining company in Houston Texas.  He was also selected
for the
Reservoir Engineering Training course with Esso production research company in
Houston Texas.<br><br>255   	In 1978 Mr Machonochie joined the
Lend Lease Group as a Project Manager to pursue a more commercial career.  He
was appointed
a Development Manager, was a foundation member of Lend Lease
Engineering, and developed some of the early infrastructure projects
in
Australia, including the 70 million 52 kilometre alumina conveyor built by Lend
Lease, Civil &amp; Civic and other projects.<br><br>256   	In
about 1984 Mr Maconochie jointed the fledgling Equitilink Australia Limited, a
newly formed funds management company, as
a consultant.  He had also begun
developing his own development businesses.<br><br>257   	In about
mid 1985 Mr Maconochie became a Director of Equitilink Australia Limited and
became partner of Messrs Sherman and
Friedman in a re-formed Equitilink
ownership group.  At that time Equitilink Australia Limited had about $120
million under management.
 Mr Maconochie&#8217;s role at Equitilink became full
time, and he worked to get the growing business organised on a stable commercial
footing and developed and marketed new products.  In mid 1985 he developed the
$US 60 million US listed The First Australia Fund
Inc.  Mr Maconochie founded
the Management Company Equitilink International Management Limited in Jersey,
Channel Islands.<br><br>258   	In February 1986 Mr Maconochie
conceived and developed The First Australian Prime Income Fund, Inc.  Its
objective was to invest
in Australian and New Zealand debt securities. 
<br><br>259   	Mr Maconochie is shown to have had experience with
underwriters in relation to attempts to duplicate the prime income fund
in
Canada and sell it as a global offering.<br><br>260   	In
Australia in 1986 it was determined to list the Australian operations of the
Equitilink Group on the Australian Stock Exchange.
 Mr Maconochie was
responsible for developing the methodology of calculating the value of the
business and restructuring the group.
 During the period since mid 1985, Mr
Maconochie was the Equitilink&#8217;s Group&#8217;s Marketing Director New
Products and developed
a superannuation venture with Prudential of the United
Kingdom.<br><br>261   	In 1987 the last product which Mr
Machonochie conceived and developed at Equitilink was Maxilink, a $100 million
split income
and growth closed end investment company listed on the Australian
Stock Exchange in about September 1997.<br><br>262   	In 1989 Mr
Maconochie began what on his evidence became the AUSMAQ service. 
<br>263   	By reason of Mr Maconochie&#8217;s experience earlier
set out, and his subsequent experience in what he stated [paragraph 2.17
of his
second statement] was &#8220;his experience in the conception, design and
development of the AUSMAQ service&#8221;, Mr Maconochie
believed that he was
qualified to make the second statement, his third statement and to express the
opinions in them upon the matters
which are properly the subject of opinion and
expert evidence.<br><br>264   	I do not intend to here set out
the whole of the sections running from pp 10-77 of Mr Maconochie&#8217;s second
statement in
which he sets out his functionality analysis, and the evidence
which he gives of the work he carried out in relation to the conception,
design
and development of the AUSMAQ service.  His evidence in paragraph 5.3 of his
second statement for example is:<br><br><i>&#8216;Between 1989 and 1995, I
conceived, developed and created the on-line securities and investment
transaction, information and
portfolio administration and reporting service
known as the &#8220;AUSMAQ Service&#8221;.  There were three forerunners to what
became
the AUSMAQ Service.  These were the EFMS Service, the Registry of Record
Proposal and the Australian Unit Exchange Proposal&#8217;.

</i><br><br>265   	In paragraph 5.3.20 of his second statement,
Mr Maconochie gives evidence that by December 1992 he had developed the new
functional
specification for the production version of the new AUSMAQ system,
and sets out its functionality.<br><br>266   	In paragraph 5.3.18
of his second statement, Mr Maconochie gave evidence that in about June 1992 he
determined to develop a
new functional specification for a AUSMAQ production
system that would satisfy the needs of the missing marketplace mechanism earlier
referred to.  That specification, he said, would be premised on his knowledge of
the marketplace and its dynamics.<br><br>267   	In paragraph
5.5.33 of his second statement Mr Maconochie gives evidence that from December
1993 he undertook the role of System
Development Director, responsible for the
design, construction and commissioning of the software and peripheral report
systems that
together would comprise the AUSMAQ Production System.  This he said
was a sub set of his overall responsibility for the overall delivery
of the
development project through to production system certification and commissioning
with live clients within the projected time
and budget. 
<br><br>268   	Mr Maconochie&#8217;s evidence in paragraph 5.3.34
of his second statement is that Mr Brian Martin was the overall systems
architect and was to be responsible for the design and construction of the
AUSMAQ trading engine and the overall system architecture.
 Mr Martin apparently
worked from December 1993 through to July 1994 in AUSMAQ North Sydney&#8217;s
development office in that role.
 Mr Maconochie&#8217;s evidence is also that he
engaged Mr Graham Nelson as the Applications Architect, and that in this role Mr
Nelson was responsible for vetting and refining the functional specification,
matching it with the systems architecture and technical
specification, and
organising the contracts with the peripheral service
contractors.<br><br>269   	Mr Maconochie &#8216;s evidence in
paragraph 5.3.44 of his second statement is that in the first quarter of 1995 he
wrote the
Standard Operating Procedures for the key administrative functions of
the production system.   He also drafted the two prime service
agreements upon
which the operation of the AUSMAQ&#8217;s functionality depended, namely the
AUSMAQ Nominee and Custodial Services
Agreement and the AUSMAQ Deposit Services
and Management Agreement.<br><br>270   	It is important to
recognise that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 79</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> </i>is directed to examining
&#8220;evidence of an opinion of [a] person that is wholly or substantially
based on [the specialised knowledge
based on the person&#8217;s training, study
or experience]&#8221;.<br><br>271   	What then is the subject
matter of the opinion expressed by Mr Maconochie which the section requires must
be based wholly or
substantially on Mr Maconochie&#8217;s alleged specialised
knowledge based on training or experience?<br><br>272   	To my
mind, there is a reasonable argument that Mr Maconochie must be shown to have
training, study or experience giving him
specialized knowledge in comparing the
functionality of services, such as the AUSMAQ service, to other services.  And
whilst Mr Maconochie
certainly has been shown to have, as it seems to me,
specialised knowledge based on his training, study or experience in relation
to
the AUSMAQ service, and in relation to its functionality, a real question
remains as to whether or not he is shown to have specialised
knowledge based on
his training, study or experience, in relation to the functionality of banking
services.  He has, however, not
only been a director of a major funds management
group, but also has been shown to have such a wide involvement in development
and
marketing of new products integrally concerned with banking activities, with
underwriters, with stock exchanges, with superannuation
and importantly in
&#8220;the design, construction and commissioning of the software and peripheral
report systems which became the
AUSMAQ Production System&#8221; and in
&#8220;the conception, design and development of the AUSMAQ Service&#8221; that
in my view
the challenge to his evidence on admissibility grounds fails.  Of
particular significance is the fact that Mr Maconochie was not
cross-examined on
his own broad, and in some cases imprecise, descriptions of his experience which
were admitted into evidence. 
He has been shown to have specialised knowledge in
relation to functionality analyses so as to permit comparisons of the
functionality
of the AUSMAQ Service with other services.  That knowledge is
based on his experience.  His opinions are given within the ambit of
his
specialised knowledge based on his experience.<br><br>273   	The
question of admissibility of Mr Maconochie&#8217;s evidence on the final hearing
may well be altogether another matter,
depending on the evidence on a voire dire
and on the trial judge&#8217;s determination of this important issue. For the
purpose of
this interlocutory judgment, I therefore proceed upon the basis that
Mr Maconochie is qualified as having specialised knowledge based
on his
training, study or experience in respect of the functionality comparisons with
which he purports to deal.  <br><br>274   	In the result I admit
Mr Maconochie&#8217;s evidence the subject of the objection.<br><br><b>The
Weight to be Accorded to the Evidence of a Partisan
Expert</b><br><br>275   	An entirely different field of discourse
is then open, and this relates to the weight to be given to Mr
Maconochie&#8217;s
evidence.  Plainly enough Mr Maconochie is to be regarded as
a partisan witness, whose impartiality is not even suggested by the
plaintiff. 
In those circumstances, Mr Maconochie&#8217;s opinions require to be very
closely scrutinised indeed, it being, it may
be thought, surprising in a case in
which the functionality issue assumes such significance, that on the
interlocutory hearing no
admissible outside evidence, of an expert nature,
capable of being tested by cross-examination, was relied upon by the
plaintiffs.<br><br><b>The Materials Available to Mr Maconochie and Upon Which
His Evidence was Based</b><br><br>276   	The defendants&#8217;
further submission was that Mr Maconochie had not proved in any sufficient
detail as a factual matter,
precisely what was the functionality of the Bank
services or projects in respect of which he purports to opine. The Court was
taken
by Mr Insall of Counsel appearing for the Bank, to the particular
documents which, for example, Mr Maconochie at p 19 of his third
statement in
paragraph 8.3, had relied upon for the purpose of making his functionality
comparisons.  In that regard, Mr Insall submitted
that the only document which
could conceivably be evidence about the Maple Leaf Project was the Initiative
System for Key Strategy
Prioritisation session of 18 December 1998 [JM  0900]. 
Mr Insall submitted that the second document [JMG 0901] was merely a proposal
from McKinsey &amp; Company, referring to their proposed involvement in the
project.  Documents JMG 0902, 0903 and 0905 related to
the Independence One
project being no longer relevant.  Documents JMG 0904, 0906 and 0908 were not in
evidence.  Document JMG 0907
constituted a speech given by Mr
Cicutto.<br><br>277   	Returning then to document JMG 0900, to be
found at PX 9/4067, Mr Insall submitted that this was an initiative submission
for
key strategy prioritisation.  I accept Mr Insall&#8217;s submission that it
is appropriately categorised as a document which one
might anticipate to find
where someone within the Bank was bringing up a concept and suggesting that it
was a good concept.  It cannot
be described as a specification of the elements
of a service.<br><br>278   	Hence, the defendants here submit
that even granted that Mr Maconochie were accepted as a person capable of giving
expert evidence
of the type which he purports to give, the simple fact is that
he has not shown that the source materials to which he had regard,
properly or
sufficiently furnish a foundation for his views as to the attributes of the
relevant proposed Bank services, here Project
Maple
Leaf.<br><br>279   	To my mind this again is a matter of serious
concern, particularly where upon the final hearing the question of functionality
and functionality comparison is almost certainly likely to be a major issue for
decision.          <i> </i>                     
<br><br>280   	It is inappropriate to set out in this judgment
the whole of the material from pp 73-113 of Mr Maconochie&#8217;s second
statement,
generally also followed from p 29 through to the end of the third
statement but in relation to Maple Leaf and Independence One. 
Those paragraphs
should be carefully read as though they had been set out in this judgment.  The
significance of Mr Maconochie&#8217;s
evidence in this regard is that,
notwithstanding any possible criticisms of his methodology and by way of a very
close examination
of how he approached the functionality exercise, the Bank has
not put forward on the interlocutory motion any evidence whatever as
to the
functionality issue.  Such evidence as the Bank had sought to put forward was
rejected as inadmissible and is not, therefore,
before the
Court.<br><br>281   	Mr Maconochie has given the following
evidence:<br><br><i>&#8216;Each of the four NAB Services has the following
characteristics:</i><br><br><b>Gateway Service (Group Wealth Creation Leadership
Team)</b><br><i>This project emulates the AUSMAQ Service, but uses the means of
a &#8220;fund of funds/master fund&#8221; trust deed to create a central
market
on which a margin can be realised on the total market of
products/intermediaries/customers.  Initially, the focus of the Gateway
Project
is more on NAB as a product vendor of discrete NAB products and NAB-branded
aggregations of NAB/other product vendors&#8217;
products in a conventional
trust structure.  AUSMAQ dispenses with the conventional means of delivering the
functionality through
a trust deed, and achieves the same functionality by
</i>(sic)<i> through a &#8220;virtual&#8221; trust in which trustee obligations
are established through the AUSMAQ Client Service Agreement, the
Deposit
Services and Management Agreement and the AUSMAQ Nominee and Custodial Services
Agreement.</i><br><br><b>Automated Margin Lending Service</b><br><i>This service
is focused on the stock broker segment of AUSMAQ&#8217;s target Market and aims
to produce a service that emulates the
broker/client cash credit/handling
processes inherent in the AUSMAQ Service.  It is proposed to expand the service
to include the
managed funds features of the AUSMAQ Service.  NAB Premium
Financial Services is the project sponsor and owner.</i><br><br><b>FX Dealing
Service</b><br><i>This service is more of a conventional FX (Foreign Exchange)
trading facility commonly used among a number of banks.  NAB Business
Financial
Services is the project sponsor and owner.  It emulates the functionality of a
Market on the AUSMAQ Service that is configured
for trading
currencies.&#8217;</i>	<br>				[Second Statement - para
8.3]<br><br><b>&#8216;Maple Leaf</b><br><br><i>The source document [JMG0900]
describes the Maple Leaf Service paraphrased as
follows:</i><br><br><i>&#8220;... building and implementing for customers direct
channel capabilities and ... systematic restructuring of all distribution
channels along direct lines through the use of technology including the
convenience and tools of the internet, personal digital assistants
and modern
communications devices&#8221;.</i><br><br><i>The Maple Leaf Service has a 100%
match with NAB Group objectives and strategies.  It also brings together a
number of existing NAB
projects and provides a coherent coordinating
influence.</i><br><br><i>It is apparent, therefore, that the Maple Leaf Service
is an integrated financial services platform designed to offer a common,
on-line,
Ecommerce-based financial service to customers across the NAB Group in
parallel with access to NAB products and services via branch,
telephone and
Automatic Teller Machine channels.  Access to the Maple Leaf service is
typically via internet, ATM, telephone and
Web TV.  It will provide a common
platform for NAB&#8217;s retailers (intermediaries/dealers) and products and
services.  The Service
is integrated with information and advice and guidance
services from third party service providers.  It will become the clearest
and
most visible point of focus of NAB&#8217;s customers and for the corresponding
activities of the NAB&#8217;s retailers and products
and
services.</i><br><br><i>Project Maple Leaf, which is the project to deliver the
Maple Leaf Service, includes the development and implementation of a service
including at least two component services, namely the development of a Direct
Bank by direct banking (the &#8220;Direct Bank Service&#8221;)
and a Global
Payments system (the &#8220;Global Payments Service&#8221;), and further, and
alternatively including at least three
component services, the Direct Bank
Service, the Global Payments Service and the Independence One Service referred
to above in this
paragraph and below in paragraph 9.</i><br><br><i>The Direct
Bank Service involves an integrated financial services platform offering
customer value to customers generally through
access to certain financial
services at any place and time through the convenience and tools of the
internet, personal digital assistants
and modern communications devices,
Ecommerce generally.</i><br><br><i>The Global Payments service seeks to attain
these objectives by the development and use of, inter alia, smart card
technology, broadband
and/or internet capability for the on-line transmission of
information and the enabling of payments transactions, either alone or
in
strategic alliance with a telecommunications or similar company, the Internet
and Ecommerce, and the development and use of related
technology.</i><br><br><i>The AUSMAQ Service can be described in the same
terms&#8217;.</i><br><br>[3rd statement - paragraphs 8.7.6-8.7.9]<i> 
</i><br>282   	Evidence was given on information and belief by Mr
Alan Copsey, Head of Australian Branch Legal at the Bank, inter alia as
follows:<br><br><i>&#8216;<b>Description of the Gateway
project</b></i><br><br><i>NAFM is currently in the process of developing a
discretionary master fund product, as the first phase of the Gateway
project.</i><br><br><i>A master fund allows investors to invest in one or more
underlying managed funds by investing in units in the master fund.  The master
fund (through its custodian) holds units in the underlying managed funds on
behalf of the investors in the master fund.  The units
in the underlying managed
funds are applied for, or redeemed, at the direction of the investors in the
master fund.</i><br><br><i>NAFM&#8217;s proposed discretionary master fund
product will allow investors to invest in a number of products offered by fund
managers
external to the NAB Group, as well as products offered by the NAB
Group&#8217;s fund managers.  The master fund will also have a
number of
&#8220;fund of funds&#8221; options, where the underlying investment mix and
fund managers will be selected for the investor,
based on a risk profile
specified by the investor.</i><br><br><i>Discretionary master funds are not a
new concept.  Financial institutions currently offering discretionary master
fund products in
Australia include ASGARD, Navigator (Norwich Union Group), ANZ
Bank, Colonial State Bank, Deutsche Bank and National
Mutual.</i><br><br><b><i>Parties involved in the Gateway
project</i></b><br><i>The Gateway discretionary master fund product has been
developed by NAFM.</i><br><br><i>NAFM uses a software package known as
&#8220;Talisman&#8221; for the administration of its unit trust products.  The
Talisman software
is licensed from the Tacit Group, an actuarial and information
technology consultancy group based in New Zealand.  The Tacit Group
has been
developing additional capability to Talisman to accommodate the proposed master
fund product.</i><br><br><i>NAFM will be responsible for administration of the
discretionary master fund product once it is launched.</i><br><br><i>Products
available to investors through the discretionary master fund will include
products managed by:</i><br><br><i>(a)	the NAB Group&#8217;s in-house fund
mangers, National Australia Asset Management Limited (&#8220;NAAM&#8221;) and
County Investment
Management Limited; and</i><br><br><i>(b)	a number of fund
managers external to the NAB Group.</i><br><br><i>National Australia Fund
Management Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NAFM is the Responsible Entity
for the master fund.</i><br><br><i>Investment management for the &#8220;fund of
funds&#8221; option will be provided by a number of different fund managers,
both internal
and external.  The National has engaged InTech Asset Consulting,
an independent specialist asset consultancy, to assist in the selection
of fund
managers for that purpose.</i><br><br><b>Current status of the Gateway
project</b><br><i>A pilot of the master fund product commenced in May 1999.  The
pilot has involved a small number of National financial planners offering
the
master fund product.  That has resulted in a number of customers investing in
the master fund product.  The master fund product
currently has approximately $1
million under management.</i><br><br><i>It is currently proposed that the full
launch of the master fund product will take place in late July
1999.</i><br><br><b>Description of the Margin Lending project</b><br><i>Margin
lending is lending against the market value of securities, such as shares,
adjusted by a gearing ratio.  It involves an investor
(or guarantor) providing
security in the form of cash, Australian Stock Exchange (&#8220;ASX&#8221;)
listed securities or managed
funds, that is mortgaged to the financier, and in
return receiving a line of credit that is used to purchase additional securities
or managed funds which are also mortgaged to the financier.</i><br><br><i>The
National does not currently offer a margin loan product.</i><br><br><i>The
Margin Lending project involves the development of a margin lending product
which will allow the National to:</i><br><br><i>(a)	provide a margin lending
service;</i><br><br><i>(b)	automate some of the tasks and transactions
associated with the margin lending process;</i><br><br><i>(c)	outsource some of
the tasks involved in offering a margin loan product;
and</i><br><br><i>(d)	utilise an additional channel through which a margin loan
product may be distributed, namely, brokers using software licensed
from Star
System Pty Ltd (&#8220;Star Systems&#8221;) (as referred to in paragraph 40
below).</i><br><br><b>Current status of the Margin Lending project</b><br><i>The
Margin Lending project is an ongoing project, with the software for the project
in the process of development.  Part of the coding
for the margin lending
software has been completed, and is being tested by the National, ACS, and other
users.  Star Systems is continuing
to develop the software, in terms of both
debugging existing code, and developing new programs.</i><br><br><i>Development
of the software is approximately two-thirds complete.  It is currently proposed
that a pilot of the product be launched
in September 1999 with a general launch
to take place in late October 1999.</i><br><br><i>The National is in the process
of negotiating with Star Systems the terms of the software licence, and with ACS
the terms of the agreement
under which ACS will provide settlement,
administration and other services.</i><br><br><i>A margin lending unit is to be
formed within the National to administer the margin loan product.  The unit will
comprise three National
employees.  It is currently proposed that this unit will
become operational by the end of July 1999.</i><br><br><i>The Margin Lending
project involves, to different degrees, employees of the National in different
sections, most of whom are not engaged
full time on the project.  It is
therefore extremely difficult, if not impossible, to isolate all of the assets
which are, or will
be, used in the project.</i><br><br><b>Description of the FX
Autodealing project</b><br><i>The objective of the FX Autodealing project is to
automate the process whereby customers of the National purchase foreign exchange
products from the National.</i><br><br><i>The system enables customers to
connect to the National by computer.  The customer chooses the foreign exchange
product required,
and the amount of currency required.  The Autodealing system
will respond with a price quoted in real time based on a number of parameters,
including the currency, the size of the trade, and the customer&#8217;s profile.
If a customer accepts the real time quoted price,
the deal details are shown to
the customer on screen.  The system automatically issues a dealing ticket, which
is provided to a foreign
exchange dealer and entered into the National&#8217;s
systems.</i><br><br><i>Where a proposed deal exceeds a customer&#8217;s dealing
or credit limits, the system allows manual dealer intervention, enabling
one of
the National&#8217;s foreign exchange salespersons to make a judgment as to
whether to proceed with the deal.</i><br><br><b>Current status of the FX
Autodealing project</b><br><i>The FX Autodealing project is currently in a pilot
phase.  Approximately 63 Business Markets&#8217; customers within Australia are
participating in the pilot by conducting their foreign exchange transactions
through the system.  This allows the National and Cognotec
to test and refine
the software and processes involved in the FX Autodealing
service.</i><br><br><i>The pilot will shortly be extended to approximately 200
customers.  It is currently proposed that the full rollout of the FX Autodealing
service in Australia will occur in October 1999.</i><br><br><i>Cognotec is also
currently developing new modules of the software in conjunction with staff from
the National, as well as debugging
existing code as a result of issues arising
from the pilot and from testing by the National.</i><br><br><b>Description of
the Maple Leaf project</b><br><i>Project Maple Leaf was the development phase of
the concept of shifting the National&#8217;s operating model from a traditional
branch-based
regional retail bank to a customer focused integrated retailer of
financial services targeting direct channels such as telephone
banking and
internet banking.</i><br><br><i>The programme commenced in mid-December 1998
with McKinsey and Company (&#8220;McKinseys&#8221;), the external consultants,
suggesting
certain strategy and implementation plans.  These plans called for
multiple phases or &#8220;episodes&#8221;.</i><br><br><i>The development phase
was completed in late May 1999.</i><br><br><i>Strictly speaking, therefore,
Project Maple Leaf has been completed.  The implementation phase has now
commenced as a new project
under the name &#8220;Operation First
Choice&#8221;.</i><br><br><b>Involved in the Maple Leaf project</b><br><i>The
Maple Leaf/Operation First Choice project is conducted by the Retail Financial
Services and Channel Management section of the
National.  It involves, and will
continue to involve, employees from a number of other sections of the
National.</i><br><br><i>In addition, a number of external contractors will be
engaged to work on specific aspects, particularly issues relating to computer
and other information technology.  For instance, Cambridge Consulting has been
engaged to assist in the development of the National&#8217;s
telephone banking
service.</i><br><br><b>Current status of the Maple Leaf project</b><br><i>The
first episode of the implementation phase has commenced.  Essentially, it
involves what is known as a customer migration strategy,
focusing on changing
customer behaviour from the traditional branch-based banking to alternate
channels, involving increased use
of automatic teller machines and telephone and
internet banking.  This involves investment in the National&#8217;s internet
banking
and web capabilities, investing in telephone call centres to enable an
increased number of transactions to be conducted by telephone
banking, and
piloting changes to the structure of bank branches.</i><br><br><b>Resources
currently employed on the Maple Leaf project</b><br><i>The project is being led
by a small group of approximately 6 persons, with a total staff of approximately
16 persons.</i><br><br><i>The project is gearing up to staffing in the order of
60 persons.  At present 30-40 people in various areas of the National are
spending
approximately 50% of their time on the project.</i><br><br><b>Effect of
a receiver being appointed to the Maple Leaf/Operating First Choice
Project</b><br><i>As the project is built very much on the expertise and
knowledge that has been accumulated from people within the National, it is
likely that for a receiver to manage the project, he or she would need to spend
a considerable amount of time understanding the aims
and objectives of the
project.  This would likely lead to a delay in the taking of decisions.  This
may have serious consequences
for key components of the project, such as
operational issues involving the call centres.  In respect of the call centres
any delay
in taking decisions may lead to a lack of call centre capacity to meet
current demand which may cause a loss of customers&#8217;.

the traditional dichotomy between an idea and the expression of an
idea:<br><br><i>&#8216;As Lindley LJ said in Hollinrake v Truswell ... :
&#8220;Copyright ... does not extend to ideas, or schemes, or systems, or
methods; it is confined to their expression; and if their expression is not
copied the copyright is not infringed&#8221;.  The distinction
has been
criticized and it is true that it is often difficult to separate an idea from
its expression, but it is nevertheless fundamental
that copyright protection is
given only to the form in which ideas are expressed, not to the ideas
themselves.  The protection of
ideas, at all events when the subject of 
manufacture, is the province of patent law.  There is a particular difficulty in
distinguishing
an idea from its expression in the case of a utilitarian work,
such as a computer program, which, in contrast to literary works of
an artistic
kind, is intended to be useful rather than to please.  But it has been held that
<u>the idea of a utilitarian work is its purpose or function and that the method
of arriving at that purpose or function is the expression
of the idea</u>: see
Whelan Associates v Jaslow Dental Laboratory ... citing Baker v Selden ... . 
<u>Thus, when the expression of an idea is inseparable from its function, it
forms part of the idea and is not entitled to the protection
of copyright</u>
....  Whelan Associates v Jaslow Dental Laboratory was a case which was
concerned with a computer program, the purpose or function
for which was to
assist in keeping records of the business operations of a dental laboratory.  It
was held that the computer program
was the subject of copyright because it was
only one of a number of programs of different structure and organization which
might
be used to achieve the same end&#8217;.</i><br><br>[173 CLR at 344-345]

Participants&#8217;.</i>	<br>	 <br>288   	It is to be recalled
that in the 6 December 1996 memorandum from Mr Breeze to Mr Barnes, referred to
in paragraph 4 of this
judgment, the Group&#8217;s interest in acquiring the
AUSMAQ business had been said to be:<br><br><i>&#8216;based on the changing
nature of our business, <u>the unbundling of product function from the customer
service function</u>, and the constant pressure to reduce
costs.</i><br><br><i>The AUSMAQ business scores highly in each of these areas
and we believe represents <u>the way forward for the delivery and support of
customer-focused services</u>&#8217;.</i><br>	<br>	[emphasis
added]<br><br>289   	It seems that the Bank itself in its
investigation of AUSMAQ, and its interest in acquiring the AUSMAQ business, was
recognising
the probable use of that service for the delivery and support of
customer-focused services.<br><br>290   	I have regard also to
the Due Diligence report conducted for the Bank between 15 and 19 July 1996 in
relation to Project Electra
and dated 25 July 1996 which appears at PX 10/4238
and following.  That report includes several sections dealing with
functionality,
also identified in a number of attached diagrams and flow
charts.<br><br>291   	Paragraphs 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4 of the Due
Diligence report at PX 4253 are in the following
terms:<br><br><i>&#8216;<b>7.1	Linking to &#8220;front-end&#8221;
systems</b></i><br><br><i>7.1.1	Electra is presently displaying the
characteristics of trying to be both the &#8220;market place&#8221; and a
service provider
to the dealers by way of portfolio management.  However, the
system currently does not meet the functionality provided by other bespoke
front-end planning systems and it is unlikely that one system would provide the
best solution for both markets.  The Bank should
consider the marriage between
Electra as a market place tool and a front end system, with the capability to
pass data between the
two within the integrated model, not requiring manual
re-keying or &#8220;cut and pasting&#8221;.</i><br><br><b><i>7.2	Using dormant
functionality</i></b><br><br><i>7.1	The system is said to contain a number of
modules which currently lie unused.  In addition to more market styles, <u>this
unused functionality includes data feeds - the ability to move data in and out
of the system</u>.  For example providing fund managers with details of training
and depth of market data (assuming the other parties agreed), moving
data
to/from research companies, other exchanges etc.</i><br><br><b><i>7.3	The
Internet as a source of ideas</i></b><br><br><i>7.3.1	The Bank should maintain a
close watch on related services available over the Internet which would
stimulate ideas on how <u>this tool, married</u> <u>with others</u>, could be
used in Australia, or indeed internationally.</i><br><br><b><i>7.4	The Intenet
as an access vehicle</i></b><br><br><i>7.4.1	The Bank should consider the
possibility of <u>providing investor access</u> to <u>the system</u>, not just
via the IVR, but also via the Internet.  For example, allowing the investor to
download information on actual portfolios,
on &#8220;what if&#8221; portfolios,
<u>to lodge instructions with a dealer, to obtain</u> <u>external data feeds
etc</u>.  By doing so, the Bank would be providing a reason for people to visit
and re-visit the site, thereby reinforcing the Bank&#8217;s
name in the
market&#8217;.</i><br>	<br>		[emphasis added]<br><br>292   	The

of dealers and fund managers, with no in-house

based on the fact that when the custodian confirms on the system that a trade
has been agreed with a fund manager, it settles both unit and cash movements
simultaneously.  Up to then, the transaction is merely
an
order.</i><br><br><i>2.1.4	Good title to units is given in return for cleared

in Electra to allow settlement within the system - this may or may not be

states:<br><br><i>&#8216;The system is likely to contain a wide range of
controls commensurate with its business
function&#8217;.</i><br><br>295   	The whole of the Due Diligence
report supports the proposition of functionality and dormant functionality of
the type pleaded
and supports the proposition that a serious and far from
speculative case has been made on an interlocutory basis that the subject
projects namely Gateway, Margin Lending, FX Auto Dealing and Maple leaf which
were  compared by Mr Maconochie with the AUSMAQ service
seek to provide services
having a similar or equivalent functionality to the AUSMAQ
service.<br><br>296   	The terms of the Bank&#8217;s media
release upon its acquisition of the AUSMAQ service, which appears at PX 10/4337
is entitled
&#8220;National Buys Electronic Trading Service&#8221;.  A copy of
that release at both pp PX 4337 and 4338 is appended [as Appendix
&#8216;F&#8217;] to this judgment.  The release requires to be read as part of
this judgment.  It relevantly states:<br><br><i>&#8216;We believe AUSMAQ has the

Paper entitled &#8220;Electra Investment Proposal&#8221; of 14 August 1996 is
located at PX 10/4350.
 At PX 10/4353 the following appears in the
proposal&#8221;<br><br><i>&#8216;1.1	<u>Strategic
Considerations</u></i><br><br><i>Electra presents <u>an opportunity to diversify
the Bank&#8217;s income sources within the financial services industry</u>. 
Whilst it is recognised that Electra does not address in any unique way the
Bank&#8217;s customer basis, it represents the creation
of a new form of
institutional business within the Bank&#8217;s industry.  In this regard it
would be similar to other services provided
by the Bank to the general
marketplace.  The closest analogy would be EFTPOS which is an open system not
targeted specifically for
Bank customers, but nevertheless is profitably managed
by the Bank.  Electra however potentially offers <u>the added advantage of
positioning the Bank as the sole service provider</u>.  Electra provides the
National:</i><br><br><i>*	A potentially significant new source of non interest
income as a service provider in the managed funds industry</i><br><br><i>*	An
immediate opportunity to participate in electronic commerce and gain a strategic
position in this emerging industry&#8217;.</i><br>	<br>		[emphasis
added]<br><br>298   	At PX 4355 under the heading
&#8220;Management Issues&#8221; the following appears in the investment
proposal:<br><br><i>&#8220;As stated above ELECTRA would represent a new
business line of potentially global dimension for the Group.  The appearance
of
ELECTRA as a division or subsidiary of AFS would be detrimental to its strategy
in the marketplace, where it is attempting to
gain the support of dealer groups
and fund managers who are the natural competitors of the Bank and NAFM.  We
would recommend that
if NAB should acquire ELECTRA, that it be managed as a
group business, with AFS providing input to group management on market and
commercial issues relevant to the monitoring of the investment.  This input will
be critical in the start up stage where NAB requires
realistic acceptance of the
commercial acceptance of the
business&#8217;.</i><br><br>299   	At PX 4357 the proposal under
the heading &#8216;Regulatory Framework&#8217; reads inter
alia:<br><br><i>&#8220;ELECTRA is a reasonably unique business.  It operates
with the appearance of a stock market and also with the appearance of
a master
trust ...&#8217;.</i><br><br>300   	The proposal, speaking to
Electra&#8217;s plans to add to the scope of the system [at PX 4357 to 4358],
refers to plans to
add to the scope of the system by the addition of savings
products, equities, secondary trading and a superannuation administration
module.  <br><br>301   	Further support for the plaintiffs&#8217;
claims on the motion in relation to functionality, and in relation to the
Bank&#8217;s
strategic plans, is to be found at PX 10/4393 in the paper
presented to the Group Executive Committee, which recommended that the
Board
approve an investment of $7 million to purchase the issues shares in AUSMAQ
Systems Limited, and which states inter alia:<br><br><i>&#8216;The AUSMAQ system
is an automated trading, settlement and administration system for retail managed
funds</i><br><br><i>*	the system offers retail investors direct access to
wholesale managed funds products in an automatic screen based
environment</i><br><br><i>*	the system is developed to the stage of being
operational ...</i><br><br><i>*	the system neither supplies product nor acts as
an intermediary. <u> It simply</u> <u>provides a marketplace and takes a
fee</u>, based on transaction volume and the quantum of funds on the
system</i><br><br><i>*	should the system succeed in attracting broad acceptance
amongst the dealer/adviser community, our Bank will <u>be positioned as a
&#8220;gatekeeper</u>&#8221; <u>for a significant proportion of the retail
investment funds flow in the economy&#8217;</u>.			</i>[emphasis
added]<br><br>302   	Support for the plaintiffs&#8217; claims for
the potential benefits in the subject markets is to be found at PX 10/4396 where
the subject paper delivered to the Bank committee states inter
alia:<br><br><i>&#8216;The retail investment products market comprises about one
third [or 92 billion] of the $300 billion managed funds market
...</i><br><br><i>*	Our best estimate is that AUSMAQ could realistically achieve
about 10 percent market share, or $3 billion of retail funds held in
open ended
funds under management&#8217;.</i><br><br>303   	At PX 4397 the
same paper states:<br><br><i>&#8216;At the very least AUSMAQ has several
years&#8217; lead on any direct
competitors&#8217;.</i><br><br>304   	At PX 4401 the transaction
structure is identified in terms of the founders receiving a one third economic
interest through
a royalty arrangement and receiving a long term management
contract.  On the same page one finds the following:<br><br><i>&#8216;The
founders - represented by John Maconochie the MD - will receive no up-front
consideration.  They will receive a royalty
which translates into an
approximately one third share of the expected net value of the business ... the
founders will be locked
into a long term management
contract&#8217;.</i><br><br>305   	Mr Maconochie&#8217;s
statements, assisted by all of these contemporaneous documents, to my mind
support the plaintiffs&#8217;
case on the motion that it has made good the
proposition that it has a serious case to be tried in terms of its claims to
breaches
of contract to the effect that the subject projects, namely Gateway,
Margin Lending, FX Auto Dealing and Maple Leaf, seek to provide
a significant
number of proposed services falling within the description &#8220;any service
with the equivalent or similar functionality&#8221;
as used in the definition of
&#8220;AUSMAQ Service&#8221; in the Consultancy Agreement.  The detail and
complexity of the issues,
both technical and legal, which will confront the
trial judge hearing the proceedings on a final basis is plain from the above
description
of the &#8220;functional equivalence&#8221; case. 
<br><br>306   	Plainly, the Court on the present state of the
evidence has only one party&#8217;s case before it on this important issue.
 And
a very significant aspect of that case as presented is that it is based upon
evidence of a witness whose involvement with JMG
means that, by definition,
impartiality is absent.  That evidence is certainly detailed but it is not
corroborated by outside third
party evidence.  These are considerations to be
taken into account in assessing the balance of convenience and as factors
bearing
upon the exercise of the Court&#8217;s discretion in favour of or
against the grant of interlocutory relief.<br><br>307   	Clearly
the trial judge will have to determine on all the evidence:<br><br>(a)	What
functionality the Bank services may ultimately have which the AUSMAQ Service may
not have;<br><br>(b)	Whether all of the functional specifications of the
Bank&#8217;s Services as said to be derived by Mr Maconochie from banking
documents may fairly be gleaned from those documents;<br><br>(c)	What the
necessary overlap will be as between the functionality of the AUSMAQ and Bank
services, to satisfy the definition &#8216;[having]
equivalent or similar
functionality&#8217;.<br><br>308   	In that regard the Bank may
elect to rely upon evidence and to address submissions seeking to negate
JMG&#8217;s functionality
case.<br><br><b>The Damages
Case</b><br><br>309   	Mr Maconochie&#8217;s fourth and fifth
statements deal generally with matters going to damages.  The allegations made
in paragraphs
11.17 and 11.18 of his fifth statement
are:<br><br><i>&#8216;11.17	The resources of JMG have necessarily been diverted
to protecting its asset, the Consulting Agreement, and NMG, almost
from the
effective start of the Agreement in November 1996, instead of JMG and
NMG&#8217;s being able to commercialise the AUSMAQ
service globally in
accordance with the Consulting Agreement.</i><br><br><i>11.18	I refer to my
first statement in these proceedings: that NAB has not used its capital,
goodwill, organisational or marketing
resources worldwide, to commercialise the
AUSMAQ service globally in a timely, efficient and proper manner in accordance
with the
Consulting Agreement as I understand
it&#8217;.</i><br><br>310   	In the final paragraph of Mr
Maconochie&#8217;s fifth statement he expresses the view that it is possible
&#8220;that NMG could
have become one of the top 100 Fortune 500 companies if
considered as an operating entity in its own right and if the AUSMAQ service
had
been commercialised globally in a timely, efficient and proper manner in
accordance with the Consulting
Agreement&#8221;.<br><br>311   	The plaintiffs claim that the
interlocutory relief appropriate is based inter alia upon the following
submission:<br><br><i>&#8216;The substantial liability or damages and/or
equitable compensation which NMG, NAB and the other Defendants are incurring by
the continued wrongdoing is one which, if it results in the destruction of the
business, undertaking and goodwill of NMG and the
NMG Group in relation to the
AUSMAQ Service and the impossibility of performing the Consulting Agreement,
will be beyond the capacity
of all the Defendants to meet, even NMG if it calls
upon NAB&#8217;s unlimited Guarantee of its obligations under the Consulting
Agreement, and NAB, as, upon the Plaintiffs&#8217; case, the quantum of damages
in such an event may well amount to USD 21 billion
and thus may exceed the
NAB&#8217;s shareholders&#8217; funds by an amount in excess of USD 10
billion&#8217;.</i><br><br>[Final Submissions paragraph
6.2]<br><br>312   	The formal particulars of the
plaintiffs&#8217; claims are set out in a document filed on 21 June 1999,
entitled &#8220;Amended
Particulars of Damages and Equitable
Compensation&#8221;.  Paragraphs 1, 3, 4 and 7 of these particulars are in the
following terms:<br><br><i>&#8216;The plaintiffs claim damages and equitable
compensation from the Defendants and each of them on the following basis and in
the following amounts: </i><br><br><i>(1)	NAB and NMG by</i><br><br><i>(a)	the
breaches of the Consulting Agreement and of fiduciary duty, and the procuring of
or participation in those breaches, pleaded
in and particularised under and in
relation to paragraphs 50, 51, 52, 53 and 54 of the Second Further Amended
Statement of Claim
and</i><br><br><i>(b)	the contraventions and participation in
contraventions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> and the Fair Trading Act pleaded in
and particularised under and in relation to paragraph 56 of the Second Further
Amended Statement
of Claim</i><br><br><i>prevented the development and
commercialisation of the business of the NMG Group throughout Australia and
globally in accordance with
the Consulting Agreement and caused NMG, and thus
JMG to suffer loss as pleaded in paragraphs 55.1, 55.2, 55.4, 55.10, 56.2, 56.3
and 57.8 of the Second Further Amended Statement of Claim by reason of
NMG&#8217;s lost custom, revenue and profitability to date
and to continue.  
The loss is probably irreversible.   NMG was in a strong position in 1996 to
exploit the Ausmaq System as a market
leader and to establish a or the leading
position in the relevant markets worldwide.   The markets have since developed
and competitors
have entered the markets and secured custom which would have
been available to NMG for the Ausmaq Service.   </i><br><i>...</i><br><i>(3)	The
loss and damage to JMG varies depending on whether and to what extent the Court
will enforce the Consulting Agreement.   The
plaintiffs claim damages and
equitable compensation, the amount of which will vary depending on the extent to
which specific performance
of the Consulting Agreement is decreed and injunctive
relief granted and damages and compensation limited to compensation for loss
from past breaches of contract and duty or whether damages and compensation
extend to cover the loss of the benefit of the whole
or part of the Performance
Bonus and other benefits under the Consulting Agreement, </i><br><br><i>(4)	The
damages and compensation claimed by JMG for breaches of contract and breaches of
fiduciary duty are within a range of <b>US$271 million as at 2003 and continuing
and probably increasing indefinitely</b> to <b>US$21 billion or more</b>
depending, inter alia, on the matters referred to in the preceding paragraph,
the method of valuation of NMG adopted to ascertain
the extent of JMG's loss of
its Performance Bonus rights, and the value of the purchase rights (&#8220;Total
Rights&#8221;) in clause
15 of the Consulting
Agreement.</i>	<br>...<br><i>(7)	JMG contends that either </i><br><br><i>(i)	NAB
would probably be compelled to exercise its Purchase Rights in respect of the
Total Rights in clause 15 of the Consulting
Agreement at 2003 at market value or
if NAB were to exercise its Purchase Rights in respect of the Total Rights at
less than market
value, JMG would be entitled to exercise its Purchase Rights in
clause 15 of the Consulting Agreement in respect of the Total Rights
at less
than market value and on-sell at market value; or</i><br><br><i>(ii)	JMG's
Performance Bonus rights under the Consulting Agreement would continue
indefinitely and probably increase for the foreseeable
future (see Clause 2 of
the Consulting Agreement)&#8217;</i><br><br>313   	To my mind, it
is inappropriate on this motion for a minute examination of all the
plaintiffs&#8217; evidence on quantum. 
Suffice it to say that the plaintiffs
have shown a serious case to be tried in relation to a very substantial claim to
damages should
the underlying causes of action be
upheld.<br><br>314   	One matter does, however, require to be
exposed.  This is that in important respects the plaintiffs rely upon many
assumptions
as to the processes which it is suggested are likely to occur if and
when Clause 15 of the Consultancy Agreement is
invoked.<br><br>315   	Appendices &#8220;G and &#8220;H to this
judgment set out:<br><br>(a)	Mr Maconochie&#8217;s 4th statement [pages 12 and
14] &#8220;description of the process of purchase of either JMG&#8217;s rights
by the Bank or the purchase of NMG and Operating Entities by JMG &#8220; -
Appendix &#8220;G&#8221;;<br><br>(b)	Mr Maconochie&#8217;s &#8220;Assumptions
for Valuation Purposes&#8221; - taken from pages 15-16, 4th statement - Appendix
&#8216;H&#8217;.<br><br>These documents make plain that the damages case,
insofar as it assumes that the clause 15 rights must lead to a buyout of
JMG&#8217;s
rights by the Bank, or by JMG of NMG and Operating Entities, may
well be misconceived.<br><br>In attempt to substantiate JMG&#8217;s case that
the Bank would almost certainly exercise its buyout option, the
plaintiffs&#8217;
counsel submitted as follows:<br><br><i>&#8216;<b>Reasons why
NAB would exercise their buyout option</b></i><br><br><i>1.	If the AUSMAQ were
as successful as the Plaintiffs contend, with continuing growth, there would be
strong commercial reasons to
exercise the buy-out provisions at the earliest
opportunity.</i><br><br><i>2.	To eliminate escalating exposure to JMG&#8217;s
buyout due to escalating revenue (JMS4 para 7.9).</i><br><br><i>3.	To eliminate
escalating exposure to JMG&#8217;s buyout due to escalating market valuations
(JMS5 para 11).</i><br><br><i>4.	To eliminate JMG&#8217;s ability to put a large
part of the Bank&#8217;s e-commerce in market play at the time of the buyout,
and
possibly precipitating a market play on the Bank itself (eg US$63 bn,
JMG&#8217;s share US$21 bn, Bank market cap in 1999 US$27
bn).</i><br><br><i>5.	To terminate the Guarantee liability (JMS4 para
7.6(i).</i><br><br><i>6.	To get rid of involvement with JMG at the earliest
possible time (6 November 2003).</i><br><br><i>7.	To gain the unfettered ability
to assign, encumber and otherwise deal in the respective rights, obligations
undet the CA without
the need to seek JMG&#8217;s consent (JMS4 para 7.6(ii)),
eg for a hiving off and listing, or other disposition.</i><br><br><i>8.	To
conduct the AUSMAQ Service within and outside the NAB Group and organise the NAB
Group unfettered by any obligations and duties
to JMG (JMS4 para
7.6(iii)).</i><br><br><i>9.	To deal in the IP unfettered by the CA (JMS4 para
7.6(iv))&#8217;. </i><br><br>316   	To my mind, this simply
highlights the many uncertainties which exist.  This is not of course to suggest
that the plaintiffs
do not hold an extremely valuable right in their entitlement
to have the chance to receive a large sum of money should the Bank purchase
JMG&#8217;s rights.  Nor is it to suggest that the plaintiffs have not shown a
serious case to be tried, capable, if proven, of leading
to a very substantial
damages verdict.  That case, of course, goes well beyond a consideration of the
buyout provisions, embraces
its alleged loss by way of diminution in value of
its Performance Bonus Rights and generally rests upon NMG&#8217;s alleged lost
custom, revenue and profitability to date and continuing.<br><br><b>Fears as to
the Destruction of NMG&#8217;s Business and
Undertaking</b><br><br>317   	In Mr Maconochie&#8217;s affidavit
made on 2 June 1999 he deals with the alleged loss of opportunities, damage to
and alienation
of NMG&#8217;s custom and goodwill in respect of the AUSMAQ
service in the United Kingdom and Europe, and deals with the damage which,
in
his view, has been sustained to NMG&#8217;s and the AUSMAQ services&#8217;
competitive position by a number of matters, including
the replacement of AIDC
by the Bank as Depositee.   He also deals in paragraph 65 and following with the
establishment and development
of the Maple Leaf service, and the Independence
one service, alleged to have occurred outside NMG, the NMG group and the AUSMAQ
service.
 He also deals with the suggested failure of the defendants to attend
to the global exploitation of the AUSMAQ service.  In paragraph
4 of this
affidavit Mr Maconochie deposes as follows:<br><br><i>&#8216;I am concerned and
fear that:</i><br><br><i>(a)	NAB is irretrievably damaging and destroying the
business and undertaking of NMG and the NMG group in respect of the AUSMAQ
service,
and consequently the rights and entitlements of JMG under the
Consulting Agreement, and </i><br><br><i>(b)	NAB is using its power, control and
influence as, inter alia, the sole shareholder in NMG over the directors of NMG
and the executives
and staff of NMG to do this; and</i><br><br><i>(c)	I am
concerned and fear that unless the interlocutory relief sought in the notice of
motion in support of which this affidavit
is sworn is granted, the business and
undertaking of NMG will be so irretrievably damaged that its prospects of
achieving and maintaining
a commercially viable business of any substance will
be completely destroyed and the full extent and value of JMG&#8217;s rights
and
entitlements under the Consulting Agreement may never be able to be
realised&#8217;. </i>[paragraph 3]<br><br>318   	In Mr
Maconochie&#8217;s affidavit of 25 June 1999 he deposes that he is concerned and
fears as follows:<br><br>(a)	that NAB is irretrievably damaging and destroying
the business and undertaking of NMG and the NMG group in respect of the AUSMAQ
service and consequently the rights and entitlements of JMG under the Consulting
Agreement;<br><br>(b)	that NAB is using its power, control and influence as,
inter alia, the sole shareholder in NMG over the directors of NMG and the
executives and staff of NMG to do this;<br><br>(c)	that he is concerned and
fears that unless the interlocutory relief sought in the notice of motion in
respect of which the affidavit
is sworn is granted, the business and undertaking
of NMG will be so irretrievably damaged that its prospects of achieving and
maintaining
a commercially viable business of any substance will be completely
destroyed, and the full extent and value of JMG&#8217;s rights
and entitlements
under the Consulting Agreement may never be able to be
realised.<br><br>319   	In paragraph 8.7 of Mr Maconochie&#8217;s
affidavit of 25 June 1999 he deposes that following a conversation with Ms Cox,
the
head of Corporate Services of NMG/AUSMAQ, he was informed and verily
believes to be true that the management of NMG has been required
(he understands
by the Bank) to comply with the methodology of Freehill Hollingdale and Page in
facilitating the removal, for extended
periods, of substantial and important
files that he believes are integral to the safe and efficient operation of the
AUSMAQ service
and of NMG and AUSMAQ systems.  He deposes that these files are
no longer under the effective control and custody of the management
of those
companies but instead, are under the control and custody of solicitors of the
firm of Freehill Hollingdale and Page who
are neither responsible nor
accountable, at present, for the disruption and damage that may be caused to the
AUSMAQ business by their
conduct.  He deposes that in his experience, the
maintenance of a secure, efficient and well controlled central filing system is
necessary to enable any enterprise to properly function, particularly one which
has control over and is responsible for substantial
amounts, perhaps billions,
of other people&#8217;s money.  He deposes that for this reason he established
such a system and enforced
it from the inception of the AUSMAQ business and the
AUSMAQ service.  <br><br>320   	Mr Maconochie further deposes to
his concerns that substantive and important files that are material to the
business undertaking
are not under the control of the management of NMG and its
Australian operating entity, AUSMAQ Systems, and that the central files
of the
business undertaking have been dismantled and the files that are on location at
AUSMAQ&#8217;s premises are under the custody
and control of an indeterminate
number of employees and possibly past employees, and not the management and
directors of NMG and
AUSMAQ systems.<br><br>321   	Mr Maconochie
in the same affidavit, expresses concerns in relation to the ability and
competence of NMG&#8217;s and AUSMAQ
Systems&#8217; management and his concerns
at JMG&#8217;s having been excluded from full and proper information about the
AUSMAQ
business, including the depositee issue since 4 August
1997.<br><br>322   	In the same affidavit in paragraph 10, Mr
Maconochie deposes that in his opinion it is apparent from an affidavit made by
D
H Hazzard, which Mr Maconochie was furnished with on 23 June 1999, that the
AUSMAQ IP is not under effective control and custody:
<br><br><i>&#8216;being
scattered amongst an indeterminate number of present and possibly past
employees, the firm of FHP whose clients have
repeatedly failed to give
undertakings as to confidentiality and 15 present and former NAB officers and
employees who could possibly
possess material relating to the depositee issue
...&#8217;.</i><br><br>323   	In paragraph 10.5 of this affidavit
Mr Maconochie deposes that in his opinion, immediate action is required to bring
the NMG
group under effective and competent management control if the value of
NMG is to be maintained and grown, the AUSMAQ IP commercialised
in accordance
with the consulting agreement and JMG&#8217;s rights
reserved.<br><br>324   	Sections of Mr Maconochie&#8217;s sixth
statement of 14 July 1999, namely paragraphs 7.2 and 7.3-7.8, are sought to be
read
on the motion.  Those paragraphs deal with representations alleged to have
been made by the Bank and Mr Maconochie&#8217;s advice
to the Bank prior to the
entry into of the subject contracts as to the global scope that he would require
for the exploitation of
the AUSMAQ service.<br><br>325   	In
paragraph 7.3.3 of the sixth statement, Mr Maconochie expresses his view that
the global exploitation and development of
the AUSMAQ IP was an essential
requirement for him and JMG and that he and JMG would not have proceeded with
the transaction with
the Bank irrespective of any other factor, if the
representatives of the Bank had not made the statements of which he had given
evidence
in his first statement, namely the pre-contractual representations. 
Generally, the sections of the sixth statement read on this
interlocutory
application deal with the subject of reliance and causation in terms of the
plaintiffs&#8217; final claims for relief.<br><br><br><b>Balance of Convenience
and Ultimate Decision on the Motion</b><br><br>326   	JMG has
proved that it has a serious and not a speculative case, which has a real
possibility of ultimate success and that
it has contractual interests, which may
well be presently being substantially eroded by the conduct of NMG and the Bank.
It has shown
a serious and far from speculative case in support of the
proposition that NMG has breached and continues to breach its contractual
obligations provided for in the Consultancy Agreement.  JMG has established
serious grounds for concern as to the Bank&#8217;s conduct,
and as to whether
JMG&#8217;s clear interests in the proper commercialisation of the AUSMAQ
service, and in the activities of NMG
and Systems, are presently being vitally
affected by the failure to hold management committee meetings, by JMG&#8217;s
effective
exclusion from its right to be represented at management committee
meetings and from the effective failure to permit the holding
of the clause
4.1(a) meetings between JMG and a management committee.  JMG has shown a serious
and not a speculative case to the
effect that it has been effectively excluded
from participating, as was intended by the Consultancy Agreement, in the
preparation
of proposed Business Plans.  JMG has shown that it has a serious
case in relation to whether or not the Bank is presently, by the
subject
Services, utilising or about to utilise the &#8220;System IP rights&#8221; as
defined by the Consulting Agreement, without
having brought itself or those
entities, such as NAFM, which apparently are to run the new services, under the
rubric of the Consultancy
Agreement by accession. [See Schedule 3 and clause
20.2]<br><br>327   	There are notwithstanding that JMG has shown
a serious case on the interlocutory motion to the above effect, very clear
difficulties
in the Court presently granting the interlocutory relief sought. 
At the end of the day, however, the simple fact is that JMG has
no proprietary
interest in the undertakings of NMG or AUSMAQ Systems.  It has contractual
entitlements of value and undoubtedly,
if its causes of action are made out at
the final hearing, a very substantial claim to unliquidated damages against the
Bank.<br><br>328   	To my mind it is appropriate, together with
the other discretionary considerations referred to below, to bear in mind the
central
structure of JMG&#8217;s transaction with the Bank at inception.  That
transaction retained for JMG only contractual rights.  JMG
has no proprietary
interest in the AUSMAQ Service or in the System I.P.
Rights.<br><br>329   	In essence, the claims to interlocutory
relief resolve into four compartments.  The first is the claim for appointment
of receivers.
 The second is the claim for sundry injunctions seeking to bring
within NMG, the Bank&#8217;s proposed services already referred
to.  The third
is comprised of injunctions seeking to force the Bank to permit NMG to presently
operate by Management Committee Meetings,
and to permit the holding of the
clause 4.1(a) meeting or meetings between the management committee and JMG.  The
fourth is comprised
of those orders seeking various types of accounting on an
interim basis.<br><br>330   	The receivership applications have
already been dealt with.  The receivership orders are not orders which in this
case and
on these facts are appropriate to be made on an interlocutory basis. 
The very fabric of the underlying businesses and the environment
in which they
operate must mean that the receivership applications fail.  Further, the
possibility of repeated applications for rulings
on the mode by which the
receiver sought to act as an umpire in relation to conflicting claims which may
be anticipated from both
parties as to:<br><br>(a)	the proper construction of
the Consultancy Agreement;<br><br>(b)	how the AUSMAQ service should be
operated;<br><br>(c)	how business opportunities for that service in Australia
and overseas should be furthered,<br><br>is a strong factor suggesting that this
form of relief is inappropriate.  [Cf <i>Patrick Stevedores</i> (supra) - and in
particular the emphasised section of the extract from the joint
judgment].<br><br>331   	Insofar as injunctions are sought by way
of orders calculated to bring the subject operations of the Bank relating to The
Gateway,
Margin Lending, FX Auto Dealing and Maple Leaf Services within the
umbrella of NMG, there are very real difficulties which stand
in the
plaintiff&#8217;s path.  JMG simply has no proprietary interest in, nor any
right to control the assets of NMG or of AUSMAQ
Systems.  Mandatory
interlocutory injunctions carry a higher risk of injustice than prohibitory
injunctions as they go further than
the preservation of the status quo by
requiring a party [in this case the defendants] to take some new positive step
or to undo what
has been done in the past.  Hence, requiring a party to take
positive steps usually causes more waste of time and money if it turns
out to
have been wrongly granted than an order which merely causes delay by restraining
the party from doing something which he was
otherwise entitled to do.  It is
also particularly difficult to formulate with sufficient precision the terms of
the mandatory interlocutory
injunctions; see the judgment of Hoffman J as he
then was in <i>Films Rover International Ltd v Cannon Film Sales Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%203%20All%20ER%20772" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986]
3 All ER 772</a> at 781; see <i>CS Phillips Pty Limited &amp; Anor v Baulderstone
Hornibrook Pty Limited </i>(Unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 26
October 1994, Giles J).<br><br>332   	Relevant to all of the
claims to interlocutory relief, and particularly to the claims in respect of the
receivership orders
and the orders seeking to bring NMG&#8217;s and AUSMAQ
System&#8217;s operations under the rubric of NMG, is the inadequacy of the
applicant&#8217;s undertaking as to damages.  Also relevant is the delay in
pursuing the proceedings.<br><br>333   	As to the undertaking as
to damages, the tax return for Idoport for the year ending 30 June 1998 (DX1 at
395 - 398) relevantly
provides that the company received income of $895,361
during the course of that year. Expenses for the year totalled $888,006, with
$473,619 attributed to &#8220;contractor, subcontractor and commission
expenses&#8221;. The 1998 balance sheet, (DX1 at 399 - 400)
part of the last
published accounts (T 16.40) records total assets of $229,808 and total
liabilities of $219,511. The tax return
for Market Holdings Pty Limited (DX1 at
403 - 406) is also for the year ending 30 June 1998. It relevantly provides that
the company
received no income during the course of the year and incurred
expenses of $1,910. The 1998 balance sheet, of that company, also the
last
published, records total assets of $12,850 and total liabilities of $135,779,
giving negative shareholder funds of $120,979.79
(T 16.30 -
.35).<br><br>334   	Where the court is balancing monetary
disadvantages as between a plaintiff and defendant, the inability to give a
valuable
undertaking as to damages is a factor which can be taken into account
in assessing the balance of convenience, and may be decisive:
<i>Wentworth v
Wentworth</i> (Unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 12 June 1997,
Hodgson J.)<br><br>335   	As to the bank guarantee earlier
referred to in the judgment, the proposition that the guarantee leaves the
plaintiffs at risk
as the Bank&#8217;s shareholders&#8217; funds are
substantially less than the plaintiffs&#8217; claim fails to recognise that it
is one thing to claim damages of up to $US 21 billion and altogether another
matter to substantiate such a claim at a final hearing.
 Clearly enough an
unlimited guarantee given by the Bank is a matter of substantial value of the
highest order.         <br><br>336   	The matter of delay has
already been referred to.  This is a case in which, in late June 1998, Mr
Garnsey QC forwarded to the
general counsel of the Bank the draft statement of
claim foreshadowing a claim to the appointment of receivers, or receivers and
managers, to the assets, business and undertaking of NMG, Systems, and other
companies of the NMG Group including the AUSMAQ Service
and the AUSMAQ IP, and
to such parts of the assets, business and undertakings of the Bank and NAFM in
which the AUSMAQ IP and the
AUSMAQ Service had been employed.  Later on 19
August 1998, JMG, by Mr Maconochie, forwarded to NMG, attention Mr Meikle, a
detailed
letter enclosing an expanded form of draft statement of claim.  On this
occasion the draft form of statement of claim [exhibit DX
1 page 241]
foreshadowed interlocutory orders and injunctions in very similar form to those
presently sought almost precisely one
year later.  By letter dated 24 September
1998 from Freehill Hollingdale &amp; Page, solicitors for the defendants, to
Withnell Hetherington,
solicitors for the plaintiffs, it was confirmed that Mr
Hetherington had confirmed to Mr Healey that the plaintiffs &#8220;would
not be
seeking interlocutory orders against our
clients&#8221;.<br><br>337   	Later on 24 September 1998 Withnell
Hetherington wrote to Freehill Hollingdale &amp; Page
advising:<br><br><i>&#8216;you enquired as to our clients&#8217; intentions in
relation to the interlocutory orders sought in the summons.  We will be
writing
to you well before the return date of the proceedings seeking undertakings from
your clients to be given to the Court.  Our
clients&#8217; intentions concerning
the interlocutory orders will depend on your response.</i>	<br>				[Exhibit DX
page 248]<br><br>338   	By letter dated 30 September 1998
Freehill Hollingdale &amp; Page wrote to Withnelll Hetherington
advising:<br><br><i>&#8216;Your clients have foreshadowed [in the summons] that
they will seek various interlocutory orders against our clients on 16
October
1998.  In particular, your clients apparently intend to seek the appointment of

Systems</i><br><i>*	certain parts of NAB and NAFM</i><br><br><i><u>It is a most
serious matter to seek orders of the kind your client seeks</u>.  It is for this
reason that we wrote to you on 24 September 1998 seeking your client&#8217;s
immediate clarification of their position.
 Your letter of the same day provided
no such clarification.  Instead of responding to our request for information,
you said that
at some stage &#8220;well before the return date&#8221; you will
be seeking unspecified undertakings from our clients and that your
clients&#8217; attitude to seeking interlocutory relief will depend upon our
clients&#8217; response&#8217;.</i><br>	<br><i>				</i>[DX 249]	[emphasis
added]<i>        </i><br><br>339   	The correspondence continued
to pass between the two firms of solicitors.  Freehill Hollingdale and Page
wrote on 8 October
1998 complaining that despite numerous undertakings to the
contrary, the plaintiffs had still not made their position clear as to
interlocutory relief.<br><br>340   	By letter of 8 October 1998
Withnell Hetherington wrote to Freehill Hollingdale &amp; Page enclosing draft
undertakings and
advising that in the absence of the undertakings being given
&#8220;the plaintiffs will seek appropriate directions on the return
date for
the hearing of an application for interlocutory relief in the form of the draft
short minutes&#8221;.<br><br>341   	The proposed undertakings
were congruent generally with the orders sought in the notice of motion before
me in mid 1999.<br><br>342   	The plaintiffs declined to give
those undertakings - see letter from Freehill Hollingdale &amp; Page of 15
October 1998 [DX
278].<br><br>343   	Thereafter the plaintiffs,
at the directions hearing of 16 October 1998, did not seek interlocutory orders
and the position
which ultimately obtained was that the plaintiffs did not
pursue the notice of motion for interlocutory relief until well into 1999.
 In
early June the amended notice of motion upon which the plaintiffs moved was
filed.<br><br>344   	These are extraordinary delays in proceeding
with the applications now made.  I do not accept the plaintiffs&#8217;
explanation
that it was not appropriate to seek interlocutory relief until the
Bank had further formalised its particular plans with respect
to the known
services.  And whilst I do certainly accept that substantial difficulties would
always have been perceived in the plaintiffs&#8217;
camp, in terms of
progressing an interlocutory application of the type here pursued by way of
having to produce the necessary evidence,
the plaintiffs always took the risk
that the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, would take into account as an
important matter,
the plaintiffs&#8217; delay. That risk is now realised.  A
significant ground for the Court&#8217;s refusal to grant the bulk of
the relief
here sought is by reason of the plaintiffs&#8217;
delay.<br><br>345   	I turn next to the claimed injunctive relief
which would require NMG to proceed to hold management committee meetings,
thereby
permitting JMG in being entitled to meet with the management committee
[clause 4.1(a)], that which is asserted to be its proper role
in relation to
preparation of draft Business Plans.  I have given close consideration to the
question of whether these are orders
which ought now to be made at an
interlocutory level.  The plaintiffs submit that no particular prejudice is
discernible from the
defendants&#8217; perspective, in permitting, as it
contracted to permit, JMG by two nominated representatives to attend at
Management
Committee Meetings.  The plaintiffs argue that the suggestion that
there are now irreconcilable difficulties which must render such
Management
Committee Meetings abortive should be rejected.<br><br>346   	One
of the considerations which it may be thought should be treated as relevant in
aid of the plaintiffs&#8217; argument that
past personality difficulties ought
not render management committee meetings abortive, is the very fact that if the
plaintiffs&#8217;
submissions were accepted, the terms of the judgment would
presumably lead to the Bank and NMG taking special care to cause management
committee meetings to be held and to afford to JMG its contractual right to be
heard at those meetings, and, particularly through
the clause 4.1(a) procedure,
to afford to JMG its contractual right to be involved in the preparation of
Business Plans in accordance
with the Consultancy
Agreement.<br><br>347   	Another factor which suggests that the
balance of convenience may be in favour of an order for the holding of
management committee
meetings is that there has been a very serious case
established that those meetings were always intended as a vehicle through which
JMG would receive such information as it was entitled to receive in relation to
the ongoing concern and business activities of NMG
and the AUSMAQ
service.<br><br>348   	Ultimately, however, I have reached the
view that the balance of convenience is against this form of injunctive relief
being
granted at this stage in these proceedings.  To my mind as the litigation
progresses through the next several months into a final
hearing, the very high
likelihood is that a management committee regime to be put in place by
interlocutory injunctive orders would
simply become a forum in which the
respective parties would be, with an eye to the final hearing, making statements
and dealing with
one another in the most artificial of environments.  Such
meetings imposed by court order are capable clearly of becoming a major
focus
for the evidence ultimately adduced during the final hearing.  It is one thing
for the parties to comply with their contractual
obligation outside of an
interlocutory injunctive regime, and altogether another matter for the holding
of management committee meetings
to be compelled by court
order.<br><br>349   	This then highlights as it seems to me the
significance of the litigation as a factor to be taken into account in the
balance
of convenience exercise.  Take for example the curious fact that the
Consultancy Agreement expressly denies to the JMG representatives
entitled to
attend at management committee meetings, any right to receive minutes of those
meetings.  Whatever may have been the
original thinking which led to the
inclusion of this provision, the fact is that by dint of the continuing
discovery obligations
of both parties in the proceedings, JMG, certainly by its
legal representatives and probably by itself, becomes entitled to discovery
of
all minutes of management committee meetings.  Hence a court-imposed injunctive
regime requiring the holding of management committee
meetings, if this is to be
enforced as a continuing contractual obligation, would presumably have to
specify that the JMG representatives
were not to be entitled to receive minutes
of those meetings.  Yet at the very same time, the discovery process would
permit JMG
to receive those minutes as part of the litigious process.  These are
real concerns and simply highlight the difficulties faced by
the court in
imposing the management committee injunctive regime now sought by the
plaintiffs.<br><br>350   	It goes without saying that the
court&#8217;s refusal to grant that form of injunctive relief says nothing
whatever to the
continued obligations in contract of the parties to hold
management committee meetings.  But that is a matter which will continue
simply
as contractual obligations without the aid of a court order, and all that such
an order would entail.<br><br>351   	It is further quite clearly
the case that JMG&#8217;s complaints with respect to the management committee
matter have been
in existence and being aired for at least two years
now.<br><br>352   	In the result to my mind the appropriate
exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion is to reject the claims to this class
of
injunctive relief.<br><br>353   	In relation to the sections
of the notice of motion as seek an order that the Bank and NMG keep separate
accounts and records,
to my mind the balance of convenience is heavily in favour
of the making of such an order provided that an order can be framed with
sufficient specificity to permit of its enforcement.  Possibly an order
generally in the form of that sought in paragraph 9 of the
notice of motion as
originally filed on 4 June 1999, but confined to the services which are still
pursued, namely Gateway, Margin
Lending, FX Auto Dealing and Maple Leaf would
have the necessary precision.  Understandably relatively little attention was
addressed
to this issue during the hearing of the motion.  In consequence, I
would be disposed to entertain further submissions on the matter.
 Plainly, a
clear question will arise as to the suggested inclusion for example of the last
two and a half lines of paragraph 9,
namely the words following the words,
&#8220;... or any other Service within ...&#8221;.<br><br><b>Fixing the
Proceedings for Final Hearing</b><br><br>354   	As already
indicated, some attention was given during the hearing of the motion to the
question of the date for fixing a final
hearing to commence.  The
defendants&#8217; submission was that the case could not be fixed for hearing
save on a tentative basis,
prior to the middle of next year.  The
plaintiffs&#8217; position was that a hearing date should be fixed from the
commencement of
term next year.  I indicated that the parties should be ready at
short notice to produce any evidence upon which they may seek to
rely on the
question of the fixing of a final hearing
date.<br><br>355   	Having now had the benefit of a short period
of time in which to examine all of the materials relied upon during the motion
and bearing in mind the Court&#8217;s conclusion that the plaintiffs have
established a serious case for trial in relation to many
of their allegations
and bearing in mind the pressing significance and urgency attaching to the case
and to JMG&#8217;s claims of
an ongoing and radical undermining of its
contractual rights, I have come to the conclusion that the case is in all
likelihood, one
appropriate to be fixed for final hearing on the first Monday in
May 2000.  The parties will have an opportunity to adduce evidence
and direct
submissions on the hearing date and the matter will be before the Court on
Friday 27 August 1999, on which date a final
hearing date will be
fixed.<br><br><b>Short Minutes of Order and Further
Submissions</b><br><br>356   	The proceedings will be stood over
for a few days to enable the parties to address submissions on the issue of the
keeping
of separate accounts and records on costs and for the bringing in of
short minutes of order.<br><br>********<br><br>LAST UPDATED: 	11/06/2002</P>
