<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>   This is a summons for the grant of an easement under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s88k.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
88K</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a>.
<P>

2	The plaintiffs are the owners of lots 17 to 36, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3</a> DP1623, which
refers to land on a spit of land about two kilometres from Byron Bay, which is
bordered on the north west by the Pacific
Ocean and on the south west by
Belongil Creek.
<P>

3	According to the deposited plan, the plaintiffs' land can be accessed from
Byron Bay via Childe Street in two ways.  First one
may turn right into Manfred
Street and then left into the Esplanade and proceed along the ocean front.
Secondly one may proceed roughly
north from the end of Childe Street along a
right of way which borders Belongil Creek.  However, the evidence shows that
the Esplanade
does not exist, either now being part of the Pacific Ocean or
covered by sand dunes.  Further, the most southerly part of the right
of way
has by erosion fallen into Belongil Creek.
<P>

4	The right of way passes to the south west of each of the lots 11 through to
at least 36, but to reach Childe Street the right
of way on the plan passes
through a corner of lot 2, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 3</a> DP1623 and over virtually the whole of lot
1. However, due to erosion from Belongil Creek most of the right of way on lot
1 has now
fallen into the creek.
<P>

5	Many years ago, probably in the 1970s a diversion right of way appeared over
lot 2 and somewhere in the 1970s it would appear
that that diversion was
sealed.
<P>

6	Lot 2 is owned by the defendant Council.  It is operational land of the
Council under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government Act 1993</a>.  The main road over lot 2 connects
with the paper right of way at the northern end of that bit of lot 1 that is
still above water.
<P>

7	 The use of the land on the spit has changed over the last ten years or so
and the plaintiffs are now possessed of some quite
valuable ocean front land.
They thought that there was a means of access over the sealed road on lot 2 and
over the right of way.
 However, there is in law no such access.
<P>

8	When this problem became apparent the plaintiffs or some of them contacted
the council to see if some arrangement could be reached.
<P>

9	It would appear that at the meeting of the Council on 27 August 1996 the
Council resolved to agree to the relocation of the paper
right of way to the
course of the main road, so long as all costs were met by the applicants and
the Council was indemnified against
action by beneficiaries of the right of way
against future liability to provide access in the  event erosion of the bank of
Belongil
creek encroached on to the right of way.  It is not quite clear to me
what this last condition meant, but that is by the bye
<P>

10	After that decision was announced to the solicitors for some of the
plaintiffs nothing seemed to happen.  This summons was taken
out on 13 August
1998 for an order under s 88K in respect of a right of carriageway and easement
for repairs and an easement for
services.
<P>

11	The matter was expedited by me last year and the issues at that time
appeared to be several.  One was the problem about the easement
for services.
Another one was whether all the right parties had been joined.  However, today
most of those problems have gone away.
 The plaintiffs now only seek a right of
carriageway in accordance with para 1 of the further further amended summons,
and it is
now clear that all the relevant parties are before the court.  It has
been conceded that all the appropriate factors necessary for
the court to grant
an easement under s 88K have been met and that the only questions for the court
are whether there are special
circumstances so as to mean that no compensation
should be ordered or, if there are no special circumstances, what is the
quantum
of the compensation to be paid to the first defendant by the
plaintiffs.
<P>

12	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s88k.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 88K</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>, so far as compensation is concerned,
provides in subs 2(b) that the court must be satisfied that the owner of the
land to be burdened
by the easement:
<P>

"Can be adequately compensated for any loss or other disadvantage that will
arise from the imposition of the easement."
<P>

13	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Subsection 4</a> is then as follows:
<P>

"4.  The Court is to provide in the order for payment by the applicant to
specified persons of such compensation as the Court considers
appropriate,
unless the Court determines that compensation is not payable because of the
special circumstances of the case."
<P>

14	It is unwise to attempt to define what are special circumstances because as
has been said more than once on the authorities the
term "special
circumstances" is incapable of precise definition and delineation, but is
intended to invite the court to consider
the facts of each particular case;<b>
Freeman v Stankovic</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1960%5d%20NSWR%20567" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1960] NSWR 567</a>;<b> D'Amico v Shire of Swan-Guildford
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%20WAR%20183" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] WAR 183</a>, 186.
<P>

15	It will be observed that subs 4 seems to suggest an all or nothing
situation.  Either the court is to grant compensation or,
alternatively, is to
make no order for compensation because of the special circumstances.  Special
circumstances do not come into
play when the court is considering the quantum
of compensation, that matter being governed by the words "considers
appropriate",
which enables all the circumstances, whether special or
otherwise, to be taken into account.
<P>

16	The background to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s88k.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 88K</a> is that without it situations could develop, for
instance involving closely spaced city buildings where owners of adjoining land
could hold developers to ransom by not granting access during building
operations and the like.  The purpose of the section was that
the court should
grant access on the basis of just compensation, rather than allowing people to
be held  to ransom in those circumstances.
<P>

17	The structure of the section seems to me to recognise that ordinarily the
owner of a legal right is to receive a just sum and
for value for what he or
she has to give over, rather than being able to demand the earth.
<P>

18	In the present case the problem has not come about by any action of the
plaintiffs or of the defendants.  It has come about because
of the natural
forces which have eroded lot 1 into the creek.  That matter now calls for
remedy.
<P>

19	It could be said, as it was said by Mr Coles QC, who appeared with Mr
Newport for the plaintiffs, that there are special circumstances
because there
was no fault on behalf of the plaintiffs; there was an open and apparent road
across lot 2, indeed sealed.  The impression
was given to everyone that this
was part of the right of way, which was open to use.  The Council acknowledged
the problem in the
resolution to which I have referred.  At that stage it did
not require any compensation and, accordingly, it would be appropriate
to
regard the present case as one of special circumstances. Added to that under
subs 5 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s88k.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 88K</a> the applicants must pay the costs of the proceedings, both
their own costs and the costs of the Council, unless the court otherwise
orders, and they have suffered delay in having to bring these proceedings when
nothing flowed from the Council's resolution.
<P>

20	I considered those submissions very seriously because I do believe they come
close to the line, but I am not prepared to find
special circumstances in the
instant case.  Without limiting the operation of the expression, it seems to me
that the court should
generally only order that someone's land be used by the
plaintiffs, under the statute without compensation, if that someone else
has
somehow or other been blameworthy.  I use the word "blameworthy" in the sense
of having brought about the scenario which now
causes the problem, or otherwise
having been completely obstructive to any reasonable attempts to solve a
problem.
<P>

21	In the instant case, the worst that could be said about the Council was that
there was masterly inaction.  The problem was not
a problem of the Council's
making and I do not consider that there is sufficient for me to find that there
are special circumstances.
<P>

22	Accordingly, I must direct my mind as to the quantum of the compensation.
<P>

23	Although this is a relatively new section in New South Wales, it having been
inserted in 1995, the section has existed in much
the same form in the State of
Queensland as s 180 of the Law of Property Act 1974 for some twenty five years.
There is some learning
to be found in the decisions of the Supreme Court of
Queensland, and in particular<b> Re Seaforth Land Sales Pty Ltd's Land (No
2)</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%20Qd%20R%20317" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] Qd R 317</a>, a decision of the Queensland Full Court.
<P>

24	There is also I believe assistance to be had in the cases decided under s
84(1)(aa) of the English Law of Property Act 1925,
which corresponds to s 89 of
the Conveyancing Act (NSW), save that the English Act provides for compensation
to be awarded in certain
circumstances; the compensation ordinarily being "a
sum to make up for any loss  or disadvantage suffered by (the person entitled
to the benefit of the covenant) in consequence of the discharge or
modification" of the covenant.
<P>

25	From the local cases, particularly<b> Tregoyd Gardens Pty Ltd v Jervis</b>
(1997) 8 BPR 15845 and<b> Goodwin v Yee Holdings Pty Ltd</b> (1997) 8 BPR
15795, the cases decided in Queensland, and the cases decided on the English
provision, to which I have referred, the
following general propositions I think
follow:
<P>

26	1.   The compensation referred to in subs 4 is the same compensation as is
referred to in  subs 2(b), that is adequate compensation
for loss or other
disadvantage; see<b> Goodwin</b> at 15801.
<P>

2.   The compensation is not a substitute for the price that could have been
exacted if the section did not exist;<b> SJC Construction Co Ltd v Sutton
LBC</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%2029%20P%20%26%20CR%20322" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 29 P &amp; CR 322</a>, 326, a decision of the English Court of
Appeal.
<P>

3.   The compensation is not just the diminished value of the affected land;<b>
Seaforth Land Sales</b> at 334.
<P>

4.   Ordinarily the compensation will be:
<P>

(a) 	the diminished market value of the affected land (including what is
sometimes called the hope value, that is the potential
use to which the subject
land could have been put<b>; Re Bowden's Application</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%2047%20P%20%26%20CR%20455" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 47 P&amp;CR
455</a>, 457);
<P>

(b)	associated costs that would be caused to the owner of the affected land;<b>
Tregoyd</b> at 15856;
<P>

(c) 	an assessment of the compensation for insecurity, loss of amenities such
as loss of peace and quiet;<b> Tregoyd</b> at 15856;<b> SJC</b> at 326; and
see<b> </b>Preston and Newsom<b> Restrictive Covenants Affecting Freehold
Land</b> 8th ed (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 1991) p 284;
<P>

(d) 	the compensation is to be less compensating advantages, if any.
<P>

5.   There may be some exceptional cases which fall outside the net of s
88K(2)(b) yet are cases where it is extremely difficult
to assess the
compensation, but it is clear that the applicant is to derive a considerable
benefit from the application.  In such
circumstances it may be appropriate to
assess the compensation on a percentage of the profits that would be made.
<P>

27	In the instant case there are no other factors than the value of the land
because nothing needs to be done to the land.  The
road is already on it and,
accordingly, the enquiry appears to be simply what is the diminished value of
the land in question.
<P>

28	The only evidence is that of a valuer, Mr Peter James Bennett, who is
experienced in valuing land on the far north coast of New
South Wales.  Mr
Bennett opines that the value of the diminution of lot 2 was $2,500.  However,
he said that there were other ways
of looking at the matter.  He under
cross-examination indicated that from comparable sales the value of lot 2 as a
building block
would be $120,000.  However, he says at the moment there are
sewer pipes 2.6 metres below the surface and that would have a profound
effect
on the ability to erect a dwelling on the land.  His valuation contains at page
17 a diagram showing what would be able to
be built on the land.  Accordingly a
prospective purchaser would need to involve himself or herself in substantial
time and cost
in  arguing with the Council about putting a dwelling on the land
(under the zoning in question permission is needed for any building
of a house
on this land) and it would cost a considerable amount of money to do the
physical work of relocating the pipes, probably
at least $25,000. Accordingly,
a reasonable arm's length purchaser would only pay $50,000 for the land.
<P>

29	Miss Blackman for the Council cross-examined Mr Bennett at some length about
these matters.  She submitted to me that there was
no evidence as to the status
of these pipes or whether they could be removed without anyone's permission;
whether they were trespassing
pipes, or what have you.  She put that without
some sort of evidence it would be inappropriate to discount the value of the
land
because of the pipes being in the soil.  Thus she put to Mr Bennett and
again to me that the value is really $120,000.
<P>

30	It does not seem to me to matter whether the pipes are there legally or not.
They have been there for some little time and a
reasonable purchaser would
apply a presumption of regularity.  A reasonable purchaser, accordingly, buying
the block would be very
reluctant to pay anywhere near its full value as a
building block.  This is even disregarding the problems there might be in
getting
permission to build on the block in any event.
<P>

31	In my view the figure of $50,000 should be taken as the value of the
block.
<P>

32	This is really to my mind the value of the block considered as being used to
its maximum potential, that is as a building block.
 (To avoid future problems
I should state that a site's maximum potential is not necessarily the basis for
assessing compensation,
but it suffices in this case as only relatively small
sums are involved).
<P>

33	If it were a building block, and if it has a road over a third of its
surface, as would appear to be the case, it might be said
to be virtually
useless so that the compensation should be close to the whole $50,000.
However, that would mean that there would
be virtually a compulsory purchase.
The Council retains the block after the easement is granted.  All that it has
is the same land
that it has now, with the same road that it has now, save that
there is a legal entitlement of the plaintiffs to use it.  Bearing
in mind that
the road only covers one-third, two-thirds of the land is available to the
Council to do whatever it is doing with the
land now.  However, in view of the
resolution to which I have referred and the general circumstances of this case,
this should be
further discounted.  It seems to me that a fair compensation
would be a quarter of the value, namely $12,500.
<P>

34	Accordingly, I make order 1 in the summons.  I order the plaintiffs to
provide to the defendant Council the sum of $12,500 upon
the easement in order
1 being registered, and unless anyone wishes to say anything I will order that
the costs of the proceedings
be paid by the plaintiffs.
<P>

35	The exhibits can be returned except where they are annexures to
affidavits.
<P>
