<p><b>THE SUPREME COURT</b><br><b>OF NEW SOUTH WALES</b><br><b>COMMON LAW
DIVISION</b><br><br><br><b>NEWMAN J</b><br><br><br><b><u>THURSDAY, 19 AUGUST
1999</u></b><br></p>
<p><br><b><u>13018/97  -  Damon Charles MILLER  v  Peter COTTER &amp;
ANOR</u></b><br><br><br><b>JUDGMENT</b><br><br><br>1   	<b>HIS
HONOUR:</b>  These are proceedings commenced by summons relating to criminal
proceedings being heard in the Local Court. The summons issued is
based on a
number of grounds.</p>
<p><br>2   	Essentially grounds 1 to 3 seek a declaration that
the proceedings, if continued, would be in the relevant sense unfair to the
plaintiff, and seek a stay on the basis of procedural unfairness. The summons
then goes on to seek orders in the nature of mandamus
and certiorari.</p>
<p><br>3   	The matters which are before the Local Court are
there consequent upon civil proceedings which were heard and determined in this
Court by Master Macready on 22 August 1995.</p>
<p><br>4   	The matter before Master Macready was a matter in
which a mortgagee sought possession of property. Before the learned Master
the
only issue was whether or not the principal sum under the mortgage had been
repaid. Plainly enough, if it had, the mortgagee
would fail. If it had not been
paid, then the mortgagee would succeed in obtaining
possession.<br>5   	In the event, the learned Master held that
the principal sum had not been repaid and made orders favourable to the
mortgagee.
I gather the matter was the subject of an appeal to the Court of
Appeal and subsequently an application for special leave to the
High Court.
Ultimately the orders made by Master Macready were upheld.</p>
<p><br>6   	The matter came into the criminal justice system
because Master Macready made a finding that, amongst other things a receipt
dated 4 July 1994 allegedly over the signature of one Henry Allsop, which was
produced on behalf of the defendant in those proceedings,
by the present
plaintiff, Mr Damon Charles Miller, was in effect a forgery. This occasioned the
learned Master to refer the papers
to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
<p><br>7   	As a consequence of the learned Master&#8217;s
referral to the Director of Public Prosecutions, two charges were laid against
the present plaintiff in the Local Court. The first charge was one laid pursuant
to s 300(1) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</b> 1900</a> and the second charge was laid
pursuant to s 300(2) of that Act.</p>
<p><br>8   	The first charge is essentially one that the
plaintiff here did make a false instrument, namely the receipt to which I have
referred
and the second charge is that the plaintiff used that false instrument,
namely the receipt to which I have referred, to cause the
mortgagee to accept
the receipt as genuine and to act according to the mortgagee&#8217;s credit.</p>
<p><br>9   	Mr Allsop, whose signature allegedly appeared on the
receipt of 4 July 1994 was acting as an agent for the mortgagee at the relevant
time.</p>
<p><br>10   	Prior to the proceedings commencing before the
learned magistrate in the Local Court, the solicitor for the present plaintiff
quite properly wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions and indeed to the
officer in charge of the investigation pursuant to
s 167 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence
Act</a></b> seeking access to the original of the receipt of 4 July 1994 and other
documents which had been in evidence before Master Macready
in order that they
may be tested by an expert.</p>
<p><br>11   	The upshot of the letters written was that the
plaintiff&#8217;s solicitors were advised that the document had been lost.
Subsequent
searches carried out in this Court and apparently elsewhere have not
been able to discover the documents which were tendered before
the learned
Master.</p>
<p><br>12   	At the hearing before the learned magistrate a copy
of the subsequent receipt of 4 July was tendered. Objection was raised but
the
learned magistrate pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48(4)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts"><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></b> 1995</a> admitted
the document into evidence.</p>
<p><br>13   	A stay was shortly afterwards obtained and the
matter now comes before this Court.</p>
<p><br>14   	The nub of the application before this Court is that
the plaintiff has been denied procedural fairness because the loss of the
relevant documents, and in particular the receipt of 4 July 1994, has meant that
he has been unable to obtain expert examination
of the documents and thus is
disadvantaged. Accordingly, he puts it that he is so disadvantaged that the
relief sought should be
granted.</p>
<p><br>15   	I should say at the outset it seems to me that
neither mandamus or certiorari can lie in this matter. Mandamus lies only when
a
mistake of law has occurred which shows that the determination arrived at in the
exercise of the jurisdiction is nugatory and void
so that the ostensible
determination by the magistrate was not a real performance of the duty imposed
by law upon him. See <b>R v War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal; ex parte
Bott</b> (1933) 228 at 242-243. In other words that the magistrate must have
misunderstood the nature of the jurisdiction which he purported
to exercise in
the matter before him. See <b>Ex parte Hebburn Limited; re Kearsley Shire
Council</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1947/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1947] NSWStRp 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281947%29%2047%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20416" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1947) 47 SR (NSW) 416</a> at 420.</p>
<p><br>16   	The principles are generally covered in
<b>Waterhouse v Gilmore</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2012%20NSWLR%20270" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 12 NSWLR 270</a> at 277. I refer also to what had
fallen from Priestly JA in <b>Saffron v Director of Public Prosecutions</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2016%20NSWLR%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 16 NSWLR 397</a> at 418.</p>
<p><br>17   	Essentially the plaintiff must show a constructive
failure to exercise jurisdiction, and in the instant case it is plain he
is
unable so to do and accordingly mandamus does not lie.</p>
<p><br>18   	Certiorari requires that an error on the face of the
record or a jurisdictional error must be demonstrated. Here, the record
is thus
far limited to the charge and the magistrate&#8217;s reasons. It follows that no
relevant error can be demonstrated in terms
of certiorari ie an error has to be
demonstrated that the learned master mistakenly asserted or denied the existence
of jurisdiction.
Accordingly, certiorari could not lie in a case such as
this.</p>
<p><br>19   	I might also state that in the matters contained in
the summons said to found relief, relief is sought under s 112 of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a></b>. For that section to apply there must be a final order.</p>
<p><br>20   	In the present matter the question which has arisen
is the admission of evidence, which is not a final matter that comes within
the
concept of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/s112.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 112.</a> Accordingly that section cannot assist the plaintiff here.</p>
<p><br>21   	Thus the matter which remains for determination by
this Court is whether or not the court should grant a permanent stay. It
is to
be assumed for the purposes of this judgment that the documents which have been
tendered in evidence before Master Macready
are permanently lost.</p>
<p><br>22   	The principles relating to the grant of permanent
stays have, over the years, following the decisions of the High Court in <b>Jago
v The District Court of New South Wales</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20168%20CLR%2023" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 168 CLR 23</a> are well
founded.</p>
<p><br>23   	The law was well summarised by Bell J in the Court
of Criminal Appeal in <b>R v Carver</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/135.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWCCA 135</a> which was determined
by that court on 11 June of this year. There Bell J noted that the principles
applicable to the question of
stay of proceedings are these:</p>
<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
(1)	The onus is on the applicant to demonstrate that the prejudice which he
would suffer in the event of a trial is unacceptable
to the extent that the
trial would be unfair.</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
(2)	That there was nothing which the trial judge could do in the conduct of the
trial to relieve against this unfairness.</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
(3)	The unfairness must arise from a fundamental defect which goes to the root
of the trial. The remedy is discretionary and will
be ordered only in
exceptional cases. See <b>Jago&#8217;s</b>
case.</blockquote></blockquote><p><br>24   	In <b>R v McCarthy
&amp; Ors</b>, unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 August 1994, Gleeson CJ
observed:</p>
<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<i>&#8220;Time and again it happens in criminal proceedings that for any one of
a variety of reasons witnesses who may be regarded as
important by one side or
the other die, or become ill, of lose their memory, or lose documents. If the
result of that were that nobody
could obtain a fair trial, and the proceedings
had to be permanently stayed, it would go a long way towards solving the
problems
of delay in the criminal lists in this State. However, the position is
that it is well recognised that an occurrence of that kind
does not of itself
mean that a person cannot obtain a fair trial or that the proceedings need to be
stayed.&#8221;</i></blockquote></blockquote><p><br>25   	His
Honour then referred to what had fallen in <b>R v Adler</b>, unreported, Court
of Criminal Appeal, 11 June 1992 and <b>R v Goldburg</b>. In
<b>Adler&#8217;s</b> case, Gleeson CJ observed:</p>
<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<i>&#8220;The fact that a witness who is potentially able to corroborate an
accused is, for one reason or another, such as death, disappearance
or
disability, unavailable at trial, does not normally produce the result that the
accused cannot obtain a fair trial and it has
not been shown to produce that
result in this
case.&#8221;</i></blockquote></blockquote><p><br>26   	Here the
plaintiff relies particularly on the evidence of a document examiner Judy
Walton. She observed that in the absence
of the documents which were in evidence
before Master Macready she was unable to arrange the undertaking of certain
forensic tests.
They included:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1.	Fingerprinting of documents.</p>
<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
2.	Identifying whether the paper contained watermark, which may help to source
and date the paper.</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
3.	Examining whether the handwriting is original or photocopied onto the
document.</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>
<p>4.	Testing of inks as to their physical and chemical properties.</p>
<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
5.	Identifying the printing process used to produce the letterhead, such as
offset lithography.</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
6.	Using a microscope to magnify and examine the signature on exhibit 3 in order
to determine whether the signature contains subtle
tremor or other indicia of
forgery.</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
7.	Using electrostatic detection apparatus to examine for any latent
indentations from other handwriting which may assist in identifying
who has
produced it.</blockquote></blockquote><p><br>27   	I should say
that in his judgment of 22 August 1995, Master Macready observed:</p>
<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<i>&#8220;One thing the cross-examination of Mr Damon Miller demonstrates in
respect of this paragraph 25 is that it is perfectly apparent
that if what Mr
Miller says he was told by Mr Allsop did happen, that he well knew that the
receipt which had been handed over on
4 July contained a photocopy
signature.&#8221;</i></blockquote></blockquote><p><br>28   	That
evidence given before Master Macready would, of course, be admissible evidence
as to what the plaintiff had said before
Master Macready and would be admissible
evidence before the learned magistrate should the occasion for that evidence to
be given
arise.</p>
<p><br>29   	Furthermore, in the civil proceedings themselves the
document was in fact examined on behalf of the plaintiff here by a document
examiner, A Dr Strach, who had reported to the plaintiff&#8217;s then solicitors
Messrs Carroll and Knudsen on 13 January 1995. In
other words, there is evidence
available to the plaintiff from an expert relating to the veracity of the
subject document.</p>
<p><br>30   	Thirdly, in the civil proceedings before Master
Macready a Mr Anderson, document examiner, gave evidence. That evidence was
supportive of the propositions which underlie the criminal proceedings against
the present plaintiff. His evidence was not challenged
before the learned
master.</p>
<p><br>31   	It would, of course, be better if the documents
which were tendered before the learned Master were documents being used in the
proceedings in the Local Court. For myself I can see that no technical error has
been made by the learned magistrate in admitting
the documents which he did as a
copy document pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48(4)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts"><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></b> 1995</a> which plainly
empowers the admission of evidence of this type.</p>
<p><br>32   	As may be seen from what fell from this Court in
cases such as <b>Carver</b> to which I have made reference and statements made
by Gleeson CJ in <b>Adler</b> and <b>McCarthy</b> the loss of a document does
not automatically give rise to a situation where there must be a fundamental
defect which goes to the
root of the trial. The remedy is discretionary and is
only to be ordered in exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p><br>33   	Here, as I have said, the key document in question
has in fact in the form it was when tendered before Master Macready, been
the
subject of expert examination on behalf of the plaintiff here. That fact of
itself in my view together with the other matters
to which I have referred,
takes this case clearly away from one involving exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p><br>34   	That being so I am of the view that the remedy
sought should not be granted and accordingly I decline to make the declaration
sought and refuse to stay the proceedings. The summons will therefore be
dismissed with costs.<br><br>LAST UPDATED: 	14/04/2008</p>
