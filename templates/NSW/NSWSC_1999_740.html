<i>Thursday, 22 July 1999</i>
<P>

<b>2284/98	ELIZABETH SLINNING   -v-   ALEXANDER SLOSS   -   ESTATE OF MABEL
EDNA SLOSS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:    </b>These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act </i>1982</a>. By summons filed on 6 May 1998 the plaintiff, Elizabeth
Slinning, seeks an order for provision for her maintenance, education and
advancement in life out of the estate of her late mother Mabel Edna Sloss (to
whom I shall refer as "the deceased").
<P>

2   	The plaintiff is one of the three children of the deceased.
The deceased died aged eighty-five on 28 December 1996. She left
a will dated
11 July 1974, probate whereof was, on 26 May 1997, granted to her son Alexander
Sloss, the executor named in such will
(who is the defendant in the present
proceedings).
<P>

3   	The deceased left the following assets disclosed in the
inventory of property: a piece of real estate situate at and known
as 378
Darling Street, Rozelle, to which an estimated value of $270,000 was at that
time ascribed; a piece of real estate situate
at and known as 84 Harrow Road,
Bexley, to which an estimated value of $185,000 was at that time ascribed;
together with moneys in
various accounts and on term deposits, and certain
shares.
<P>

4   	The present assets comprising the estate of the deceased
consist of the net proceeds of sale of the Darling Street property,
which
realised considerably more than the estimate of $270,000 disclosed in the
inventory of property.  The present net balance is
represented by the sum of
$455,456, together with an amount held in a cash management at call account
(having a balance of $54,286),
and a small amount of $629 in a cheque account
with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
<P>

5   	There have been a number of distributions to the
beneficiaries named in the will, to which distributions I shall shortly refer.
Thus it will be appreciated the amount presently held by the defendant does not
represent the totality of the assets of the estate.
<P>

6   	By her will the deceased gave shares in various companies
to each of her three children. To the plaintiff, Elizabeth Slinning,
she gave
her shares in John Fairfax Limited. To the defendant, Alexander Sloss, she gave
her shares in L J Hooker Limited and Network
Finances Limited. To her other
son, Sidney Innes Sloss, she gave her shares in Amcol Limited. However, by the
time of the death of
the deceased, the shares in John Fairfax Limited had been
sold. The plaintiff received  no benefit from the gift of those shares
referred
to in the will.
<P>

7   	Further, by her will the deceased gave to her son Sidney
Innes Sloss (known in the family as Innes) a life estate in the property
at 84
Harrow Road, Bexley. The remaindermen in respect to that property are the
plaintiff and the defendant in equal shares as tenants
in common absolutely or
the survivor of them.  The residue of the estate was divided equally between
the plaintiff, the defendant
and their brother Innes as tenants in common in
equal shares.
<P>

8   	The distributions to which I have already referred have
were made to the beneficiaries in December 1997, August 1998 and December
1998.
In addition, there has been a further distribution to the defendant in April
1999; and, in addition to his distribution from
residue, Innes has regularly
received rental income from the Harrow Road property of which he is the life
tenant; that property is
leased out at the present time.
<P>

9   	The plaintiff has received, by way of such distribution,
amounts totalling about $23,000, and the defendant has received an
almost
equivalent amount. Innes has received similar amounts, as well as rental income
which has thus far totalled about $14,000.
It is estimated that when a final
distribution of residue takes place, each of the three children of the deceased
will receive a
further amount of about $155,000.
<P>

10   	The plaintiff, as a child of the deceased, is an eligible
person within paragraph (b) of the definition of that phrase contained
in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. As such she has the standard
to bring the present proceedings.
<P>

11   	The plaintiff was born on 28 August 1937. She is presently
sixty-one years of age. The plaintiff qualified as a nursing sister.
She still
retains a practising certificate from the Nurses' Registration Board of New
South, however, it is some time since she last
practised in the nursing
profession.
<P>

12   	The plaintiff married in 1960. She and her husband had
four children. The plaintiff's husband died on 16 November 1977, when
their
children were aged respectively sixteen, fourteen, twelve and ten years.
<P>

13   	The plaintiff, as a result of her husband's death,
receives a New South Wales government pension which is CPI indexed. At
the
present time that pension is in an amount of $705 a fortnight. The plaintiff
resides in a house property at 16 Airedale Avenue,
Earlwood. That property has
been the family home of the plaintiff, and her late husband whilst they were
married, and of their children
until each child in turn set up her or his own
independent establishment. At the present time, the plaintiff lives in that
house
property on her own.
<P>

14   	The affidavit of Terence Ross Houlahan, a registered
valuer, sworn 15 July 1999, gives as the valuation of that house property
at
the present time the sum of $410,000.
<P>

15   	The plaintiff presently has a number of investments by way
of term deposits and investment accounts which total $99,767. She
is liable for
her legal costs of the present proceedings, in respect of which an estimate has
been placed before the Court in an
amount of $28,000.
<P>

16   	There has also been placed before the Court evidence
concerning  the present state of health of the plaintiff. That evidence
was
given not only by herself but also by way of affidavit from her medical
attendant Dr Jane Asher. The plaintiff has suffered a
traumatic injury to her
spine which required traction and surgery and which has prevented her from
performing work in the nursing
profession which involves the lifting of
patients.
<P>

17   	The plaintiff has also in recent times undergone surgery
for uterine cancer and currently suffers from diabetes and from anxiety.

<P>

18   	The plaintiff has placed before the Court information
concerning various repairs and renovations and refurbishment to her
residence
which she says that residence needs or which she says she desires to acquire.
Those items include bathroom renovations,
kitchen renovations, painting of the
house, new carpets, new roof tiles and various appliances and items, such as a
refrigerator,
a video cassette recorder, a recliner lounge chair, a wheeled
occasional table, a portable television and several other items.  In
total, the
renovation, repairs and refurbishment and acquisition of household items comes
to $45,800.
<P>

19   	The plaintiff in her affidavit evidence set forth details
of her pharmaceutical and medical expenses. It emerged from her
oral evidence,
however, that she has recently acquired a Commonwealth health card for senior
citizens, and that thus her expenditure
on pharmaceuticals is considerably less
than it might have been before she received that card.
<P>

20   	The plaintiff has for some years past undertaken casual
work as an examination supervisor for the New South Wales Education
Department.
That work is for a relatively short period each year and involves supervising
the Higher School Certificate examination
and several other examinations. 
<P>

21   	The plaintiff owns a Toyota motor vehicle which was
purchased second hand for $17,000 and the plaintiff ascribes to that motor
vehicle a present value of about $13,000.
<P>

22   	Evidence was given by the plaintiff concerning two trips
overseas which she has had, one in September 1998 with a choir of
which she is
a member, extending over a period of six weeks to the United Kingdom and to
America, and the other in 1987 to the United
Kingdom and to Israel.
<P>

23   	I have already referred to the fact that the plaintiff's
four children are adult and are independent of her.  Nevertheless,
the
plaintiff commendably has expressed a desire to assist her daughter, Megan, who
is the youngest child of the plaintiff. Under
cross-examination the plaintiff
agreed with Counsel for the defendant that her house property at Earlwood was a
very comfortable
home; she also agreed that her present financial position was
secure, that she was in a reasonably comfortable circumstances and
that she
presently has sufficient to pay for her needs.
<P>

24   	Evidence was placed before the Court concerning the
financial and material circumstances of the defendant. He is a retired
bank
officer. Jointly with his wife he owns their matrimonial home at Dundas (to
which an estimated value of $240,000 was ascribed),
a Mitsubishi Magna motor
vehicle having a value of $8,000, and a camper trailer having an estimated
value of $1,000.  The plaintiff
and his wife jointly conduct an account with
the Commonwealth Bank, having a credit balance of about $4,000. The defendant
worked
with the Commonwealth Bank  from 1956 until 1990. Upon his resignation
from the bank in that latter year he received a superannuation
entitlement with
which he then set up his own superannuation scheme, which gives to him an
income from that source of about $25,000
or perhaps a little less.  His total
taxable income for the 1996/97, year was $26,100.
<P>

25   	The defendant set forth details of his weekly outgoings
for himself and for his wife and for their youngest child, who still
lives at
home with them. Their other three children are independent of the defendant.
The defendant was born on 6 April 1940, and
is presently fifty-nine years of
age. 
<P>

26   	The youngest of the three children of the deceased, Sidney
Innes Sloss, was born on 27 April 1944. He is presently fifty-five
years of
age.
<P>

27   	The evidence discloses that there is a considerable degree
of disharmony between each of the three children of the deceased
and the other
two children. The plaintiff has no contact whatsoever with either of her
brothers.  Each of the plaintiff and the defendant
has been in receipt of what
might be described as somewhat eccentric communication from their brother
Innes.
<P>

28   	The defendant attempted to read in the present proceedings
an affidavit sworn by Sidney Innes Sloss which had been prepared
and filed not
by the solicitors for the defendant but by a firm of solicitors which at the
time had been acting for that deponent.
Since the whereabouts of the deponent
were unknown to either of the parties to the proceedings and since the deponent
was not present
to be cross-examined upon the affidavit and since the rest of
the affidavit was objected to on behalf of the plaintiff, I refused
to allow
the affidavit to be read. 
<P>

29   	Details of the financial and material circumstances of
Innes are therefore not available to the Court. It is, however, known
that he
has a not insubstantial interest in the estate of his late mother, the
deceased, in that, firstly, he has a life estate in
the property at Harrow
Road, Bexley from which he receives an income, and, secondly, he has an
entitlement to one third of the residue,
which will, as soon as the present
proceedings have been concluded, give him an amount of about $155,000. The gift
of shares made
to him by the will of his mother appears to have been of no
practical benefit, since by the time of the death of the deceased, those
shares
were worthless.
<P>

30   	It will be appreciated that each of the defendant and
Sidney Innes Sloss is also an eligible person in relation to the deceased,
each
being a child of the deceased.
<P>

31   	I have had the benefit of receiving from Counsel for the
plaintiff a written outline of her submissions on behalf of the plaintiff,
which written outline together with the chronology prepared by each party and
the schedule of the plaintiff's investments and expenses
will be retained in
the Court file.
<P>

32   	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the
provision made for her by the will of the deceased was not adequate provision.
The plaintiff referred to her present financial needs and to what has been
described as her limited earning capacity. I have been
taken to the decision of
the High Court of Australia in<b> </b><i>Singer v Berghouse </i>(1994) 101 CLR
201 and to<b> </b><i>Gordon v Parkes </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2017%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 17 NSWLR 1.</a> In addition, I have
also be taken to the decision of the Court of Appeal of New South Wales in<b>
</b><i>Hunter v Hunter </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20573" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 573</a> and <i>Permanent Trustee Company
Limited v Frazer </i>(1995) 35 NSWLR.  I have also been taken to an unreported
decision of Young J in<b> </b><i>Walker v Walker </i>(17 May 1996) and to an
unreported decision of Harper J in the Supreme Court of Victoria<b>
</b><i>Baird v National Trustees Mutual Limited</i> (22 November 1995).
<P>

33   	The plaintiff under cross-examination agreed that she was
very angry at the situation about the shares of John Fairfax Limited
which the
deceased, at the time of the making of her will, intended should be given to
the plaintiff. Those shares were sold during
the lifetime of the deceased. They
realised an amount of $67,000. The fact that the deceased no longer owned those
shares at the
time of her death had the practical consequence that the
plaintiff was deprived of that addition amount of $67,000. 
<P>

34   	The plaintiff agreed under cross-examination with the
proposition that basically one of the reasons why she had instituted
the
present proceedings was that she did not get those shares.  The plaintiff said
that she just wanted some justice out of the whole
situation.
<P>

35   	In performing the first stage of the two stage process
described by the High Court in<b> </b><i>Singer v Berghouse, </i>at 208 - 209,
it is necessary for the Court to determine whether the applicant in a claim
such as the present has, by reason of the
testamentary provisions of the
deceased, been left without adequate provision for her proper maintenance,,
education and advancement
in life.
<P>

36   	It is abundantly clear in the present case that the
plaintiff has not been left without such provision.  That conclusion of
itself
is sufficient to dispose of the present proceedings. It is unnecessary for me
to proceed to a consideration of the second
stage in the process described
in<b> </b><i>Singer v Berghouse</i>.
<P>

37   	There is no justification in the present case for the
intervention of the Court. The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> </i>constitutes a
statutory qualification upon the freedom of testamentary disposition to which
every person in this state is entitled.
Neither the present financial and
material circumstances of the plaintiff nor the provisions made for her by the
will of the deceased
are such as would justify any intervention by the
Court.
<P>

38   	The plaintiff is in a secure situation as far as her
accommodation and her income are concerned. The desires which she has
expressed
--- refurbishment renovations to her house and acquisition of utensils and
property and appliances for that house and new
furnishings --- can all be
adequately met out of the benefit which she will receive when the further
distribution of residue from
the estate of the deceased takes place and she
receives a further amount of $155,000. It will not be necessary for her to have
resort
to her present investments totalling almost $100,000 or to reduce in any
way the income which she receives from those present investments
in order for
her to effect the improvements and repairs to her house or to achieve any of
the other desires expressed in her evidence.
<P>

39   	That being so, it is unnecessary for me to proceed to a
consideration of any competing claims upon the testamentary bounty
of the
deceased. I will merely say that the financial and material circumstances in
which each of the other two beneficiaries find
themselves certainly are not
better than that of the plaintiff and, at least in the case of Sidney Innes
Sloss, are probably worse.
<P>

40   	However, the conclusion which I have already expressed
concerning the failure of the plaintiff to demonstrate relevant need
is of
itself sufficient to determine the outcome of the present claim. I propose to
dismiss the summons.
<P>

41   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the summons be dismissed.
<P>

2.	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the defendant of the
proceedings, such costs to be on the party and party basis,
and that the
defendant be authorised to retain from the estate of the late Mabel Edna Sloss
("the deceased") the difference between
aforesaid costs and the costs of the
defendant on indemnity basis; and that the defendant be to retain from the
entitlement of the
plaintiff the estate of the deceased the amount of aforesaid
costs on the party and party basis.
<P>

42   	The exhibits may be returned and any documents which have
been produced by any party in answer to a subpoena or in answer
to a notice to
produce may be retrieved by the parties in the Court room as soon as I adjourn,
so that they need not go back to the
Exhibits Office.
