<center><b>KARIN S RENDER v  CHIEF JUSTICE A M GLEESON</b></center>
<P>

 
<P>

<center><b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1  	<b>WOOD CJ at CL:</b>  The plaintiff has filed a summons in this
Court seeking an order that Chief Justice Gleeson "hand over the judgment of a
court hearing
in which he was the presiding Judge in 1970 or 1971".  She also
seeks orders that his Honour hand over her guardianship papers, her
personal
medical file and hospital reports, as well as the file containing the names of
the persons who have committed criminal offences
against her.  The defendant
seeks an order dismissing the proceedings.
<P>

2  	In her summons, the plaintiff asserts that at the "hearing" his
Honour awarded her compensation from the Australian Government,
 unconditional
permanent residency, as well as certain property.  
<P>

3  	The plaintiff has alleged, in various other documents placed into
evidence, that this "hearing" was conducted at a time when
his Honour was a
barrister but claimed to be a Judge.  Although the documents are somewhat
unclear, it appears that it is alleged
that there were a number of other
persons present and that the proceedings followed an event when the former
Queensland Police Commissioner,
Mr Whitrod, had sexually assaulted the
plaintiff and that various felonies were committed by him and by his staff.
<P>

4  	The documents allege that in 1970, the plaintiff received a
letter requiring her to attend as a witness in a Sydney court hearing
and that
during that "hearing", presided over by his Honour, he was informed that she
received $22.5 million and other property by
way of compensation which was to
be received by her at the latest in 1979.  The documents also suggest she had
received permanent
residency and that the Consul for Germany had been made her
guardian.
<P>

5  	Various other allegations are made in the documents, of course,
of which it is asserted that from time to time the plaintiff
received
psychiatric assistance and was placed under hypnosis and has suffered a
suppressed memory.  She also says that, during the
course of the proceedings, a
psychologist who was present was sentenced to gaol for three months.  I do not
think it necessary to
refer in any greater detail to the material as it is in
similar vein.  
<P>

6  	The evidence does, however, establish that the Chief Justice was
not appointed a Judge of any court until November 1988. He
was, in 1970 and
1971, a junior counsel.
<P>

7  	A short reading of the material discloses to my satisfaction that
no reasonable cause of action is disclosed and that the proceedings
are both
frivolous and vexatious. 
<P>

8  	I direct in accordance with SCR Part 13 R 5, that the proceedings
be dismissed generally.
<P>

9  	An order has been sought for costs.  I order that the plaintiff
pay the defendant's costs of the motion.
<P>
