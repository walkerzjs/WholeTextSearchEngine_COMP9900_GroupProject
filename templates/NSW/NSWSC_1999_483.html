<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Appeal against decision of Residential Tenancies</b>
<P>

<b>				  Tribunal - Costs order against a non-party)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By summons filed 3 December 1998 the plaintiff
seeks that the order made by the Residential Tenancies Tribunal on 23 November
1998
be set aside.  The plaintiffs relied on an affidavit of Kenneth Jeffrey
Wolf sworn 28 November 1998 and each of the first defendants
relied on their
affidavits sworn 15 December 1998.  Mr Wolf and Ms Banwell were cross examined.

<P>

2  	Mr Wolf is a licensed real estate agent, and agent for Steven and
Lucy Li who are the landlords of premises 6 Katoa Place Marsfield
(the
property).  The first named first defendant is Gregory Cassis and the second
named first defendant is Deborah Banwell who were
the tenants of the property.
The second defendant is the Residential Tenancies Tribunal.  It has filed a
submitting appearance. 
The plaintiffs reside in Hong Kong.  They have filed an
affidavit in these proceedings specifically stating that they gave their
authority to their managing agent Mr Wolf to attend the Residential Tenancies
Tribunal.  From the contents of this affidavit they
have taken an active role
in these proceedings.  Mr Wolf appeared for the plaintiffs when the matter was
listed for directions before
the court on previous occasions.  I granted Mr
Wolf leave to appear on behalf of the plaintiffs at the hearing of this
appeal.
<P>

3  	The plaintiffs bring this action under s 107 of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/" class="autolink_findacts">Residential Tenancies Act</a></b> 1987 (NSW) (the Act).  This section provides
that an appeal under this section shall be made in accordance with the rules of
the
Supreme Court and subsection (2) provides that in proceedings before it the
Tribunal decides a question with respect to a matter
of law, a party to the
proceedings who is dissatisfied with a decision may appeal to the Supreme Court
against the decision.
<P>

4  	I turn to briefly state the facts.
<P>

(1)	The plaintiffs have engaged real estate agents to manage their property on
their behalf for a number of years.  The last real
estate agent is Kenneth Wolf
of Toplot Pty Limited at 776 Pacific Highway Gordon which is styled Ray White,
Gordon.
<P>

(2)	The plaintiffs and the defendants entered into a residential tenancy
agreement on 25 September 1996.  It is common ground that
the lease expired on
4 April 1997 and after that date the defendants remained in occupation of the
premises under a continuing lease.
 
<P>

(3)	On 9 November 1998 a letter was faxed to the office of Ray White, Gordon
office and marked to the attention of Mr Wolf.  The
names appearing at the top
of the letter were Greg Cassis and Deborah Banwell and the address was 6 Katoa
Place Marsfield (the property).
 The letter referred to the tenancy agreement
and said:  "We hereby give notice of our intention to terminate our Rental
Agreement
effective from today.  According to that agreement we will vacate the
premises on Friday 23rd November."  The letter also stated
that their rent was
paid up until 20 November 1998, they would pay one more week on the 20th to
bring it fully up to date.  The letter
foreshadowed that an inspection would be
necessary and suggested that the agency call and arrange a suitable time.  The
letter was
signed off "Yours sincerely, Greg &amp; Debbie" which was type
written.  No handwritten signatures of Greg or Debbie appeared on
the fax.  
<P>

(4)	Mr Wolf received this fax and subsequently telephoned Mr Cassis (the first
named first defendant) on 9 November 1998.  During
the telephone conversation
Mr Wolf referred to the letter and the date of termination being 23 November
1998.  Mr Wolf told Mr Cassis
that this was not enough notice as there had to
be 21 days notice given so the earliest date they could terminate the lease
would
be 30 November 1998.  That much of the conversation is common ground.
According to Mr Cassis Mr Wolf then said that they had to fax
him an amended
version that afternoon or the termination period would extend by a day.  Mr
Wolf said that he considered this fax
an invalid termination because it was not
signed and it was a facsimile copy but he cannot remember if he advised Mr
Cassis accordingly.
Mr Wolf perceived the difficulty with the unsigned fax was
that he could not compare the signatures with those that appeared on the
lease
with those contained in the letter as a means of establishing the authenticity
of the notice of termination.
<P>

(5)	On 9 November 1998 a further fax was sent by Greg Cassis and Deborah
Banwell to Ray White at Gordon.  It also was marked to
the attention of Mr Wolf
and referred to the tenancy agreement.  This time it said "We hereby give
notice of our intention to terminate
our Rental Agreement effective from today.
According to that agreement, we will vacate the premises on Monday 30th
November [<b>Please note correction</b>]."  They stipulated in the second
paragraph of the letter that they would pay one more week from the 20 November
to bring them fully
up to date to 30 November and also stated "[<b>Please note
correction</b>]".  A hand written note was placed at the foot of that letter by
Mr Wolf which read "Noted as invalid".  Mr Wolf cannot specifically
remember
when he made that notation but thinks that it was a day or two after he
received the fax.  He denied placing that notation
on the fax after he had been
to inspect the premises.
<P>

(6)	On Wednesday 11 November 1998 Mr Wolf telephoned the first named first
defendant to elicit their permission to have the house
open for inspection on
Saturday 14 November 1998.  The first named first defendant did not accede to
this request as he thought that
they had not been given reasonable notice.  The
parties continued the conversation and became acrimonious towards each
other.
<P>

(7)	On the following day, 12 November 1998 Mr Wolf lodged an application before
the Residential Tenancies Tribunal on behalf of
the plaintiffs seeking that the
termination notice served by the tenants on 9 November 1998 was invalid and
seeking that the premises
be allowed to be opened for inspection.  A copy of
this application is not before the court.
<P>

(8)	On 23 November 1998 the Residential Tenancies Tribunal made the following
interim orders:
<P>

<b>"1.	The landlords are to cause their agent to produce at the adjourned
hearing an authority to appear in their proceedings signed
by them both.</b>
<P>

<b>2.	The tenants request to be represented by a solicitor is refused but the
tenants are hereby granted leave to be represented by a
tenants
advocate.</b>
<P>

<b>3.	The Tribunal finds that the termination notice served by the tenants on
9/11/98 by fax advising of their intention to vacate on
30/11/98 is
valid.</b>
<P>

<b>4.	The parties are encouraged to further discuss the issues in dispute in
view to reaching settlement and the applicant is to advise
the Registry
accordingly should the matter be resolved and a further hearing is not
required."</b>
<P>

5  	The hearing was adjourned to a date to fixed by the registrar and
a separate notice of the new hearing date was to be sent to
the parties in the
near future.  Although this does not appear in the judgment, if the parties
presented their case in the same manner
as they did in this court, it would
have been evidence to the Tribunal of the acrimony between the parties.  Both
Ms Banwell and
Mr Wolf when cross examined were keen to establish the
correctness of the positions they had taken throughout their dispute.  It
is
most likely that the parties would have displayed the same attitude at the
Tribunal as they did before me.
<P>

6  	The plaintiffs submitted that the Tribunal erred in law by
declaring the termination notice valid because firstly it was a notice
served
by facsimile and secondly the notice was not signed by the defendants.
<P>

7  	Section 63(2) of the Act provides that notice of termination of
residential tenancy agreement given to a landlord by a tenant
shall be in
writing and signed by the tenant or the tenant's agent and specify the day on
which vacant possession of the residential
premises will be delivered up to the
landlord and specify and give particulars of the ground (where applicable) on
which the notice
is given.  It is clear that the defendants had not complied
with s 63(6)(b) of the Act in that they did not sign the notice of termination.
The first named defendants sought to rely on <b><u>Love v Chryssoulis</u></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%2016%20ACTR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 16 ACTR 1</a> at p 4.  However, s 63(2)(b) of the Act specifically refers to
the need for a signature.  In relation to service of a notice of termination,
the plaintiffs drew my attention to s 130 of the Act which refers to service of
documents.  
<P>

8  	Section 130(2) of the Act provides:
<P>

<b>"A notice or other document (other than a notice of termination) required to
be given to landlord under this Act may be given: </b>
<P>

<b>...</b>
<P>

<b>(b1)	by sending it by facsimile transmission to the landlord's usual place
of residence or business or employment;  or</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	in such other manner as may be prescribed for the purposes of this
section or approved by the Tribunal.</b>
<P>

9  	The plaintiffs submitted that a notice of termination cannot be
served by facsimile transmission.  However s 130 (4) states
that notice of
termination given under this Act may be given in such manner as may be
prescribed for the purposes of this section.
 These sections are to be read
with s 66 of the Act which provides:
<P>

<b>"Tribunal may waive defect in notice of termination</b>
<P>

<b>66.	The Tribunal may, if it thinks it appropriate to do so in the special
circumstances of the case, make an order terminating a residential
tenancy
agreement and an order for possession of residential premises even though there
is a defect in any notice of termination
of the agreement."</b>
<P>

10  	The plaintiffs referred me to a decisions of <b><u>NM
Superannuation Pty Limited v Baker</u></b> (NSWSC, Cohen J unreported, 4 March
1992), <b><u>Hircock &amp; Anor v Farrelly</u></b> High Court of Australia,
Queensland Law Reporter 29 February 1960 and <b><u>Neill &amp; Anor v Hewens
&amp; Anor</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1953/92.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1953] HCA 92</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281953%2d54%29%2089%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1953-54) 89 CLR 1.</a>  
<P>

11  	<b><u>Hircock</u></b> concerned a case where a party brought an
action for specific performance of an oral agreement for the sale of property.
At the trial
of the action by a judge and jury, the jury found that there was a
concluded oral agreement for the sale of the property and awarded
a party
damages of &#163;1,700.  It was held by the High Court that since there was no
sufficient note or memorandum to satisfy the
Statute of Frauds and Limitations,
the action should have been dismissed.  I did not find this case useful.
<P>

12  	In <b><u>Neill</u></b> the High Court held that the parties had
intended to sign the document before a completed contract was made.  In these
circumstances
the document which had the vendors' names appearing in
typewriting was not to be regarded as a signature for the purpose of satisfying
s 54A of the <b>Conveyancing Acts</b> 1919-1943 (NSW).  I did not find this
case helpful.  It should be noted that the two cases referred to above were
decided well before
facsimile transmission became an acceptable method of
business communication and the <b>Conveyancing Act</b> 1919-1943 (NSW) required
certain documents to be evidenced in writing.
<P>

13  	In <b><u>NM Superannuation</u></b>, a notice under a trust deed
was sent by facsimile transmission.  The Fund was created on 30 October 1973 by
the declaration of trust,
the first schedule to which contained the rules
governing the Fund.  One of the issues Cohen J decided was whether the notice
given
by the facsimile transmission was adequate notice in writing in
accordance with r 42(1).  The relevant part of r 42(1) provided:
<P>

<b>"the Fund or any part thereof may be terminated by the Company by giving the
Trustee 30 (thirty) days' notice in writing to that effect."
</b>
<P>

14  	His Honour held:
<P>

<b>"I see no reason for finding that a notice sent and received by facsimile
transmission is any less a notice in writing then one which
is sent and
received in any other fashion. The piece of paper which results from the
transmission is not the original document nor
does it contain an original
signature. It therefore may not be adequate in cases where a signature is
required. I do not need to
decide that question however as r42 makes no mention
of the notice having to be signed on behalf of the company or having the common
seal affixed. It merely requires that the notice be in writing. In my opinion
that includes any form of printing or other means of
reproducing words in
visible form. Furthermore, that would be consistent unto the meaning given to
"writing" in Acts and statutory
instruments under the definition in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s21</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation Act</i> 1987</a>.</b>
<P>

15  	Thus, a notice sent and received by facsimile transmission is
acceptable as one which is sent and received in any other fashion
but it may
not be adequate in cases where a signature is required.  His Honour then looked
at the relevant rule to ascertain whether
a facsimile transmission was
acceptable.  In the case before me, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 63(2)</a> of the Act requires that the
notices from a tenant to a landlord must be signed.  Section 130(2) requires
notices (other than a notice
of termination) from a tenant to a landlord to be
forwarded by facsimile.  But s 130(4) permits a notice of termination given
under
this Act to be given in such a manner as may be prescribed for the
purposes of this section.  It is my view that s 130(4) permits
a notice of
termination to be given by facsimile transmission.  There was evidence of
animosity between the parties which regrettably
still continues to this day.
The Tribunal more likely than not took this into account when it decided to
exercise its power under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66</a> of the Act to waive the defect in the notice of
termination of the agreement.  Even if it did not take the conduct of the
parties
into account <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66</a> of the Act has discretionary power that the Tribunal
is entitled to exercise if it sees fit to do so.  It did in this case.  No
error
of law arises from the Tribunal's exercise of power pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66.</a>
The plaintiffs' representative also complained that when the first named
defendants appeared at the Tribunal they sought to be represented
by a
solicitor.  The Tribunal refused their application.  This complaint cannot give
rise to an error at law.  The onus was on the
plaintiff to establish that the
Tribunal had erred in law and they have not done so.  Accordingly I affirm the
decision of the Residential
Tenancies Tribunal of 23 November 1998.  I dismiss
the summons.  Costs should follow the event.
<P>

16  	The first defendants have sought an order that both the
plaintiffs and Mr Wolf pay their costs.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 76</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court
Act</a></b> (NSW) provides:  
<P>

<b>"(1)	Subject to this Act and the rules and subject to any other Act -</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	costs shall be in the discretion of the Court;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	The Court shall have full power to determine by whom and to what extent
costs are to be paid;  and</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	The Court may order costs to be assessed on the basis set out in
Division 6 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p11" class="autolink_findacts">Part 11</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act 1987</a> or on an indemnity
basis."</b>
<P>

17  	In <b><u>Knight &amp; Anor v F P Special Assets Limited &amp;
Ors</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20174%20CLR%20178" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 174 CLR 178</a>, the High Court considered whether <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s58.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 58</a> of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></b> 1867 (Queensland) applied to non parties.  This
section differs from s 76 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></b> (NSW).  The majority
(Mason CJ, Deane and Gauldron JJ) held that according to their natural and
ordinary meaning, the words of O
91 of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b>
(Queensland) are sufficiently expansive to enable the court to make an order
for costs against a person, whether that person is formally
a party to the
proceedings or not.  It was stated that obviously the prima facie general
principle is that an order for costs is
only to be made against a party to
litigation.  However, there are a variety of circumstances in which
considerations of justice
may, in accordance with the general principles in
relation to awards of costs, support an order for costs against a non-party.
This
category of case consists of circumstances where the party to litigation
is an insolvent person or a man of straw, where the non-party
has paid an
active part in the conduct of the litigation and where the non-party, or some
other person on whose behalf he or she
is acting or by whom he or she has been
appointed, has an interest in the subject of the litigation.  If the
circumstances of a case
fall within that category an order for costs should be
made against the non-party if the interests of justice require that it should
be made. 
<P>

18  	It is my view that the ordinary meaning of the words in s 76 of
the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></b> (NSW) are sufficiently expansive to enable the
court to make an order for costs where the person is not formally a party.
Orders
for costs can be made both for and against a non-party when it is in the
interests of justice to do so.  It is my view that Mr Wolf
has an interest in
this litigation.  He asserted that the Residential Tenancies Tribunal should be
a "level playing field".  However,
it appears that he was acting in the
landlords', (the plaintiffs) interests in pursuing this appeal.  I am not
satisfied that it
is in the interests of justice to order that both Mr Wolf and
the plaintiffs pay the defendants' costs.  The order I make is that
the
plaintiffs should pay the first defendants' costs as agreed or assessed.
<P>

19  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The decision of the Residential Tenancies Tribunal of 23 November 1998 is
affirmed.
<P>

(2)	The summons is dismissed.
<P>

(3)	The plaintiffs are to pay the first defendants' costs as agreed or
assessed.
