ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1	The plaintiffs, Mr George Tsatsoulis and his wife, Mrs Mary Tsatsoulis, for
whom Mr A.S. Howen of Counsel appeared, are the parents
of Mr Sam Tsatsoulis
deceased, ("the deceased"), who died on 1 September 1994, and the joint
executors of his estate.  In that capacity
they commenced these proceedings by
a Summons issued on 19 February 1997 in which the first defendant was Westpac
Banking Corporation,
("Westpac"), for which Mr P.J. Dowdy of Counsel appeared;
the second defendant was Ironaid Pty Limited, which is now in liquidation,
("Ironaid"), for the liquidator of which Ms M.L. Kelly, Solicitor, appeared;
the third, fourth and seventh defendants were respectively
Mr John Niccolo
Cosco, his wife, Mrs Kay Violet Cosco, and Trigamist Holdings Pty Limited,
("Trigamist"), for whom and which Mr M.K.
Meek of Counsel appeared; the fifth
defendant was an accountant, Mr J.J. Smiles, for whom Mr P.T. Russell of
Counsel appeared; and
the sixth defendant was a solicitor, who is no longer
involved in the proceedings.
<P>

2	The deceased was the brother-in-law of Mr Harry Sialepis, who carried on
various businesses basically involving real estate ownership
and development,
either personally or through corporate vehicles which, at least prima facie and
for all practical purposes, he controlled.
 One was Sialepis Pty Limited.  Mr
Sialepis has been involved in lengthy and highly acrimonious litigation with
his former wife in
the Family Court of Australia concerning, in particular, a
property settlement.  He has been made bankrupt, although I was informed
from
the Bar table, without objection, that he may now have obtained a discharge.
<P>

3	The plaintiffs have experienced difficulties in formulating the case they
seek to bring.  It will be necessary to refer to the
various allegations
contained in the original Summons and amendments to it, which have ranged over
forgery, bribery, fraudulent and
corrupt conduct, unconscionability and
conspiracy and to deal with them in more detail in tracing through the numerous
amendments
and the fate which has befallen them.  I am presently concerned with
an application by the plaintiffs for leave to rely on a Further
Amended
Summons, which was filed on 19 June 1998, the granting of which leave is
opposed by the defendants.  Before coming to that
I shall trace what has
occurred thus far.
<P>

4	On 7 March 1997 Giles CJCommD directed that an Amended Summons be filed and
served within seven days and stood the proceedings
over to 21 March 1997 for
directions.  He stated that on that date the Court should be told whether any
of the defendants proposed
"to make a strike out application".  An Amended
Summons was filed on 20 March 1997 and, on 21 March 1997, his Honour, in what
he
described as "the fairly unusual circumstances of this case" considered
particulars were appropriate, and noted that there may be
applications to
strike out.  He stood the proceedings over to 11 April 1997.  The central
allegation in that document was that the
deceased's signature had been forged
on certain mortgages given by him to Westpac.
<P>

5	On 11 April 1997 he extended the time for answering particulars, and made
orders in relation to any application to strike out
the Amended Summons.
<P>

6	The matter came before him on 9 May 1997 when he granted leave to file a
Notice of Discontinuance against the sixth defendant,
thus removing him from
the proceedings, and stood the motion to strike out the  Amended Summons over
to 23 May 1997.  On that day
his Honour heard the motion and, on 4 June 1997,
he dismissed it on the basis that the plaintiffs had pleaded a "triable" case,
and
stood the proceedings over for directions on 6 June 1997.  On that day he
directed the second to seventh defendants to file and serve
Defences by 20 June
1997, gave further directions and stood the proceedings over to 5 September
1997.  On 5 September 1997 he gave
 directions, which accommodated the holding
of a mediation between the parties, and stood the proceedings over until 3
October 1997.
<P>

7	On 3 October 1997 the proceedings came before me and, in a short judgment, I
noted that a matter central to the plaintiffs' case
was an allegation of
forgery against the first defendant.  I referred to the plaintiffs' having
retained a handwriting expert to
consider whether the documents upon which
Westpac relied "in truth bear the signature of" the deceased.  I was informed
that his
report had not been completed, and I stood the proceedings over to 10
October 1997 to enable that to be done.  By that time Ironaid
was in
liquidation and I granted leave to the plaintiffs to file an application to
proceed against it.  That has not happened.
<P>

8	On 10 October 1997 the matter was before Giles CJCommD and he granted leave
to the plaintiffs to file in Court a Notice of Motion
returnable instanter
seeking leave to further amend the Amended Summons. By this time it was
apparent that the allegation of forgery
could not be maintained. He stood the
motion over to 24 October 1997 and gave directions for the parties to indicate
their attitude.
 On that date the matter was stood over to 7 November 1997,
when it was stood over to 5 December 1997 "to enable the parties to consider
the resolution of the matter".
<P>

9	A Further Amended Summons was apparently filed on or about 13 October 1997,
followed by a Further Amended Summons filed on 15
October 1997.  A Further
Amended Summons was filed on 5 November 1997 and, on 12 December 1997, the
matter came before me when I
granted the plaintiffs leave, if so advised, to
file and serve a Draft Further Amended Summons by 4 pm on Wednesday, 4 February
1998.
 I made it clear that that was not to be taken as in any way suggesting
that I would ultimately grant leave to file the document
in those terms, and I
directed that that version of the Summons be made returnable on Friday, 6
February 1998, and that in the event
of the defendants objecting to the
granting of the amendments notice thereof be given by 4pm on Thursday, 5
February 1998.
<P>

10	On 6 and 13 February 1998 I was informed that the proceedings and
proceedings between Mr Sialepis and his former wife were moving
towards a
settlement and I stood them over until 20 February 1998 to enable that, if it
was to occur, to be finalised.
<P>

11	On 28 February 1998 the proceedings came before me again when the
solicitors, who had acted for Mr and Mrs Tsatsoulis to that
time, advised that
their instructions had been withdrawn both in relation to Mr and Mrs Tsatsoulis
and Mrs Sialepis.  In those circumstances
I stood the proceedings over to 3
April 1998 to enable the plaintiffs to obtain other legal advice.  On that day
Mr Howen appeared,
for the first time, on behalf of the plaintiffs.  He sought
a further adjournment.  I did not grant the adjournment he sought but
stood the
proceedings over to 17 April 1998 on which date I received no helpful
information as to what the plaintiffs proposed to
do in the light of the
various difficulties apparently confronting them, which are recorded in the
transcript.  I also gave directions
by consent and in due course heard an
application to dismiss the Amended Summons filed on 20 March 1997, which,
notwithstanding the
various amendments made, remained the one on which the
plaintiffs relied.  I concluded that it should be dismissed and I granted
the
plaintiffs leave to file and serve a Further Amended Summons, if so advised, by
4 pm on Friday, 19 June 1998.  I delivered my
reasons for judgment on 27 May
1998.
<P>

12	In that judgment  I noted that the detailed history, which I recited, showed
that thus far the plaintiffs had been guilty of
substantial and unexplained
delay in pursuing the proceedings and, in so far as they had prosecuted them by
alleging forgery, they
were doing so either on a totally untenable basis or
pursuant to a totally unacceptable Summons, namely that which I gave them
limited
leave to file on 12 December 1997.  The consequence of that order,
against which there was no application for leave to appeal, was
that there was
no originating process on foot on the basis of which the plaintiffs had leave
to proceed.
<P>

13	I concluded that it was inappropriate to allow a case based on forgery to go
forward and, accordingly, I struck out the Amended
Summons.  I then considered
whether I should dismiss the proceedings and refuse leave to re-plead, which
was the position for which
the defendants urged.  I decided, in the exercise of
my discretion, not to take that course but to grant leave to re-plead and I
made the order to which I have referred.  However, my reasons made plain that
the plaintiffs could not expect further indulgences
from this Court if they
failed to plead a tenable case.
<P>

14	On 3 July 1998 I made orders by consent granting the defendants leave to
request any further particulars, and I stood the proceedings
and a Notice of
Motion for their dismissal over, by consent, until 17 July 1998.  On that date
I ordered the plaintiffs to answer
the outstanding request for particulars made
on behalf of Mr and Mrs Cosco and Trigamist, directed that the Notices of
Motion for
dismissal stand over to 7 August 1998 and gave certain further
directions.
<P>

15	On 14 August 1998 I gave further directions and specially fixed for hearing
the defendants' Notices of Motion for summary disposal
 on 30 November 1998 for
a period of three days.  The delay between 14 August 1998 and 30 November 1998
was occasioned, essentially,
because of the difficulty in finding a date
suitable to Mr Howen.  In the course of a judgment I wrote on 14 August 1998 I
said:-
<P>

	<b>"In the ordinary course of things however, the matter could have been heard
either to-day or in the reasonably near future.  However,
Mr Howen of Counsel,
who has been retained on behalf of the plaintiffs for some little time, is to
commence a lengthy criminal trial
in September and the parties, if I may say
so, sensibly agree that it would be consistent with the general interests of
justice to
accommodate that particular commitment of Mr Howen so that he would
be able to remain in the matter and in consequence, the work
which he has done
in preparing the matter, would not be lost to Mr and Mrs Tsatsoulis."</b>
<P>

16	Notwithstanding the assistance afforded by the Court to meet the convenience
of the plaintiffs and their counsel, the unfortunate
history continued and, on
27 November 1998, I vacated the hearing date of 30 November 1998, essentially
because of Mr Howen's unavailability.
 On 11 December 1998, with the consent of
all parties and their legal representatives, I specially fixed the hearing to
commence
on Wednesday, 24 February 1999.
<P>

17	On 24 February 1999 there was no appearance by Mr Howen at 10 am and,
ultimately he appeared at about 10.20 am and informed me
that he was part heard
before Studdert J.  His instructing solicitor, Mr Vouroudis, had told me that
Mr Howen was detained elsewhere,
but he was present at all times.  I have set
forth what transpired in a judgment I wrote on that day declining any further
adjournment,
particularly in the light of the fact that all parties had
furnished written submissions to Mr Howen to which they proposed to speak
and
as I was able to accommodate hearing Mr Howen's submissions thereon on 25
February 1999.  Mr Howen had failed to furnish any
written submissions in
response.  I was able to take this course as Mr Vouroudis was in Court at all
times that submissions were
made.  The submissions did not deviate in any
material respect from what the legal representatives for the various defendants
had
written.  The only written submissions missing, as at 24 February 1999,
were those of Mr Howen.  Once the application for the adjournment
was refused
there was no objection to the moving parties making their submissions and Mr
Vouroudis handling the matter in his absence
and to the extent to which I have
referred.  On 25 February 1999 Mr Howen handed up written submissions and
addressed me in relation
to them and the submissions made on behalf of the
defendants.
<P>

18	I am now concerned with whether the sixth pleading filed on behalf of the
plaintiffs should be struck out.  I have, however,
recited the history of the
matter to show that the delay since 19 February 1997, a period now in excess of
two years, has been occasioned
solely by the failure of the plaintiffs to plead
their case properly and by the indulgences they and their legal representatives
have sought from and been granted by the Court. 
<P>

<b>The Basic Facts</b>
<P>

19	The proceedings arise out of certain basic and apparently undisputed facts.
The Nature of Dispute in the Further Amended Summons
filed on 19 June 1998
stated:-
<P>

	<b>"1.	The plaintiffs are the executors of the estate of the late Mr Sam
Tsatsoulis (the `deceased').  The deceased was a tenant-in-common
with Mr Harry
Sialepis in an investment property in Newcastle.  Mr Harry Sialepis also (sic)
a registered proprietor as tenant-in-common
with Mr Geoff Thibou of property at
Rutherford.  The deceased agreed to purchase Mr Thibou's half interest in the
Rutherford property.
 The deceased agreed with Mr Sialepis to increase the
partnership borrowings from the First Defendant to about $400,000 in order
to
purchase the half share and further develop the commercial property.  Mortgages
were granted to the first defendant in respect
of both properties to secure the
borrowings."</b>
<P>

20	None of these matters are in issue and, in fact, are relied upon by the
defendants to show that the deceased agreed with Mr Sialepis
to enter into
commercial arrangements and to increase the partnership borrowings from Westpac
to about $400,000 for business purposes.
<P>

21	In paragraph 2 it is stated:-
<P>

	<b>"The two properties also became security for various advances and loan
facilities for the benefit of Mr Sialepis and his companies.
 The deceased and
Mr Harry Sialepis maintained a partnership bank account with the first
defendant."</b>
<P>

22	Neither of these matters are in issue and, in paragraph 3, it is stated:-
<P>

	<b>"The plaintiffs allege that the deceased did not consent to nor had
knowledge of these properties being used as security for advances
and loan
facilities largely for the benefit of Mr Harry Sialepis.  The extent of these
advances and loan facilities was in excess
of $6 million."</b>
<P>

23	It is not in issue that the mortgages over the Newcastle and Rutherford
properties extended to cover those advances.  However,
there is no evidence
that either Westpac or the assignees of the mortgages granted by the deceased
to it, namely Ironaid and after
it went into liquidation, Trigamist, have ever
sought to recover from the deceased or his estate any amount in excess of
$400,000,
together with interest thereon and costs.  Accordingly, although the
mortgages granted covered the indebtedness of Mr Sialepis the
only attempt to
recover money, albeit not, so far as I am aware, by way of curial proceedings,
from the deceased or his estate is
to the extent of the money which,
conformably with paragraph 1 of the Nature of Dispute, the deceased agreed to
borrow.
<P>

24	In paragraph 4 it is alleged that through "a corrupt relationship between Mr
Sialepis and an officer or officers of the first
defendant, the approval and
payment of various loans were facilitated by Mr Kay and the first
defendant".
<P>

25	Mr Kay was an officer of Westpac and, as will be seen, it is alleged that he
and others entered into a conspiratorial agreement
to, in effect, cause the
deceased to execute a mortgage or mortgages in circumstances where either the
contents of the documents
were not known to him, or where the document or
documents contained a number of blanks, which enabled them to be "fraudulently
manipulated"
to bring about a result different from that intended by the
deceased.  It will be appreciated immediately that these are two quite
separate
allegations.  In paragraph 4 of the Nature of Dispute it is also stated that
secret commissions or bribes were paid to Mr
Kay and that he received non-cash
benefits from Mr Sialepis.  It is asserted in paragraph 5 that Westpac
"through" Mr Kay facilitated
the withdrawal of $100,000 from the partnership
account in favour of Mr Sialepis, although it was conceded by Mr Howen that the
Further
Amended Summons made no claim for any relief in respect of that amount,
and although certain amendments were foreshadowed none was
made to accommodate
any order in relation to that amount, or the basis on which such an order
should be made.
<P>

26	In paragraph 7 it is asserted that Mr Sialepis and his company defaulted in
their obligations to Westpac as a result of which
it called upon the
properties, which secured the loans from it, including the properties in which
the deceased was a registered proprietor
as tenant-in-common, in March 1995.
It is not subsequently pleaded however that by virtue of that conduct the
deceased suffered any
loss, although it should be noted that in paragraph 6 it
was pleaded that:-
<P>

	<b>"The said properties were income earning and the rental income was
sufficient to cover repayments to the first defendant."</b>
<P>

27	However, the point is that there is no allegation that had the securities
not been called up and had the rental income been sufficient
to cover
repayments the Newcastle and Rutherford properties would have been retained
profitably for the deceased.  The particulars
of "lost opportunity of the use
of the capital asset and rental income" assert:-
<P>

	<b>"The deceased and then the Plaintiffs have lost the opportunity to among
other possibilities to maintain sufficient equity in the
half share in the said
properties so that the interest could have been retained to be sold at a later
time with a capital gain and
until such time the deceased and the Plaintiffs
could have received the benefit of the rental income generated by the said
properties.</b>
<P>

<b>	The opportunity was gained on registration of the deceased's interest as a
tenant-in-common and was lost on execution of the fraudulently
procured loan
documents and mortgage.</b>
<P>

<b>	............</b>
<P>

<b>	............</b>
<P>

<b>	If the deceased had sold his interest he <u>could</u> have made a capital
gain.  If the deceased had the opportunity of keeping his interest he would
have received the benefit of the
rental income and the taxation benefits of a
negatively geared interest in property."</b>
<P>

There is no pleading as to any damage.  I am prepared to assume, for present
purposes, that this is the damage allegedly sustained
by the plaintiffs.  There
is a claim for an accounting of rental income.  There is also a concession that
the relief the plaintiffs
seek is subject to the payment of $230,000 together
with interest thereon.
<P>

28	It is now necessary to appreciate the involvement of the other defendants.
It is convenient to do so by reference to the remaining
paragraphs of the
Nature of Dispute:-
<P>

	<b>"8.	The third, fourth and fifth defendants having actual knowledge of the
corrupt relationship between Mr Harry Sialepis and Mr Greg
Kay, conspired with
officers of the first defendant and others to corruptly facilitate the
assignment of the debts due to the first
defendants (sic).  The debts and
securities supporting the debts were assigned to the second defendant for about
$4 million.  This
was a discount of approximately $10 million.</b>
<P>

<b>	9.	As a result of the debt portfolio being assigned to the second
defendant, the second defendant took possession of the properties
securing the
loans, including those in which the deceased was a registered proprietor.  The
second defendant also took the benefit
of the rental income generated by the
properties.</b>
<P>

<b>	10.	After the appointment of a liquidator to the second defendant in
October 1996, the debt portfolio was assigned to the seventh
defendant.  The
third and fourth defendants were directors and shareholders in both the second
and seventh defendants.  The seventh
defendant also took the benefit of rental
income generated by the properties.</b>
<P>

<b>	11.	Neither the first, second or (sic) seventh defendants have (sic)
accounted to the deceased or the estate for the rental income
or benefits
received from the said properties."</b>
<P>

29	Accordingly the allegations are that Westpac assigned to Ironaid the various
debts and securities it held and, after the appointment
of the liquidator to
Ironaid, the debts and securities were assigned to Trigamist.  The claim is in
respect of the non provision
of the rental income or benefits received from the
properties.
<P>

30	However, it is necessary to note the relief which is sought.  The first
paragraph seeks an order pursuant to s.87(2) of the <b>Trade Practices Act</b>
or, alternatively, s.7 of the <b>Contracts Review Act</b> that subject to the
plaintiffs repaying to Westpac the aggregate of $130,000, $30,000, $25,000, and
$45,000 together with interest
thereon from various specified dates on the
amounts, mortgage registered number 1565318 given by Mr Sialepis and the
deceased to
Westpac, in so far as it concerns the deceased's half interest, be
set aside.
<P>

31	An order is then sought that the assignment of that mortgage by Westpac to
Ironaid be declared void and to have conferred no
entitlement on Ironaid and/or
Trigamist in so far as the deceased's one half share is concerned.
<P>

32	Orders are also sought that Ironaid and Trigamist account to the plaintiffs
for the net proceeds of one half of all rental income
or other benefits
obtained pursuant to the assignment and transfer and for an order for damages
against Westpac, Mr and Mrs Cosco
and Mr Smiles.  Alternate relief is also
sought.  It is against this background that it is necessary to look at the
proposed pleading,
which was further amended and added to in a document Mr
Howen handed up on 25 February 1999.
<P>

<b>The Present Applications</b>
<P>

33	The defendants seek orders pursuant to Part 13 rule 5 that the proposed
Further Amended Summons be dismissed, and pursuant to
Part 15 rule 26 that it
be struck out.  Orders are also sought pursuant to Part 5 rule 12 and Part 33
rule 6 that it be dismissed.
<P>

34	Part 5 rule 12 and Part 33 rule 6 are concerned with the dismissal for want
of prosecution.  For present purposes I find it better
to deal, at least in the
first instance, with the applications pursuant to Part 13 rule 5 and Part 15
rule 26, the former of which
provides:-
<P>

	<b>"5(1)	Where in any proceedings it appears to the Court that in relation to
the proceedings generally or in relation to any claim for
relief in the
proceedings:-</b>
<P>

<b>	(a)	no reasonable cause of action is disclosed; </b>
<P>

<b>	(b)	the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious; or</b>
<P>

<b>	(c)	the proceedings are an abuse of the process of the Court, </b>
<P>

<b>	the Court may order that the proceedings be stayed or dismissed generally
or in relation to any claim for relief in the proceedings.</b>
<P>

<b>	   (2)	The Court may received evidence on the hearing of an application for
an order under sub-rule (1)."</b>
<P>

35	Part 15 rule 26 provides:-
<P>

	<b>"26(1)	Where a pleading:-</b>
<P>

<b>	(a)	discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence or other case
appropriate to the nature of the pleading;</b>
<P>

<b>	(b)	has a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay in the
proceedings; or</b>
<P>

<b>	(c)	is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court,</b>
<P>

<b>	the Court may at any stage of the proceedings, on terms, order that the
whole or any part of the pleadings be struck out.</b>
<P>

<b>	    (2) 	The Court may receive evidence on the hearing of an application
for an order under sub-rule (1)."</b>
<P>

36	The test to be applied for the summary dismissal of proceedings was laid
down in <b>Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1949/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1949] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281949%29%2078%20CLR%2062" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1949) 78 CLR 62</a>;

demanding nature of it is well understood and the Court is obliged to exercise
great caution in invoking the summary jurisdiction
to terminate an action where
any arguably triable question of fact or law emerges on which the rights of the
parties depend.  As
Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ said in <b>Webster</b>, at
pp.611-612:-
<P>

	<b>"Nonetheless, the material before the Master was clearly not such as to
justify a finding that the proceedings against Sergeant Lampard
are `hopeless'
in that they will inevitably fail if allowed to proceed to trial in the
ordinary course.  It follows that the order
giving leave to Sergeant Lampard to
enter summary judgment cannot be sustained."</b>
<P>

To succeed in the present application the defendants must meet this highly
demanding test.  Further the Court must look to the substance
of the
allegations made.  The fact that the pleading is expressed in an infelicitous
manner, if, in truth, it otherwise discloses
a cause of action is not,
generally speaking, a ground for dismissal.  The Court must look to the
substance  and not merely the form.
 Finally, the plaintiffs are entitled, at
least prima facie, to the assumption that the facts pleaded are true.  This is
cut down
somewhat by the right of those challenging the pleading to lead
evidence.  Essentially, however, the Court will not determine matters
of fact
which are in issue on an application to strike out pleadings. 
<P>

37	I find it convenient, in view of certain submissions Mr Howen made, to refer
to the requirement for pleading in the Summary of
Contentions in matters in the
Commercial List.  A submission was made that the Summary of Contentions does
not have to comply with
the strict requirements of pleadings and, in
particular, that a party dissatisfied with the degree of particularity should
seek particulars
and, thereby, ascertain the totality of the case sought to be
made, rather than move to strike out the pleading, even where serious
allegations of forgery, bribery, fraud and conspiracy are raised.  I do not
agree with this submission.  Practice Note 100 requires
that the plaintiff's
Contentions should avoid formality; state the facts on which the plaintiff
relies together with adequate particulars;
and identify the legal grounds for
the relief claimed.  I wish to emphasise that this Practice Note makes it clear
that it is not
sufficient to plead generally and to rely upon the furnishing of
particulars to flesh out the pleadings and, thereby, to disclose
a cause of
action.  A defendant, in my opinion, is entitled to take the Summary of
Contentions as they stand and, without seeking
any further particularisation,
to move to have the Summons dismissed for one of the grounds set forth in the
Rules to which I have
referred.  The defendant is not obliged to seek further
and better particulars to make good a cause of action inadequately pleaded
or
particularised.  The comments I have just made apply with even greater force
when, firstly, the pleading to which objection is
taken is the sixth attempt by
the plaintiffs to put forward their cause of action; and, secondly, serious
allegations are pleaded,
which should only be alleged on firm and definite
instructions based on the availability of at least, prima facie, credible
evidence.
<P>

<b>The Previous Pleadings</b>
<P>

38	Because of the course of the proceedings and in order to understand some of
the submissions made, it is necessary to track through
the pleadings to see the
allegations which have been made and to compare them, at least to some extent,
with the allegations presently
being made.  The original Summons asserted that
on 30 October 1992 the signature of the deceased was forged on a mortgage in
favour
of Westpac over the Rutherford property to the knowledge of Mr Kay, such
that the undivided one half share in that property of the
deceased should not
be encumbered by that mortgage.  There were further allegations of forgery of
the deceased's signature to the
knowledge of Mr Kay.  There were also various
other allegations raised in relation to the dealings between the parties
leading to
relief being sought that the estate of the deceased was entitled to
an unencumbered undivided one half share in the Newcastle and
Rutherford
properties; a declaration that the defendants in trade or commerce engaged in
conduct which is unconscionable "within
the meaning of the unwritten law" being
s.51A of the <b>Trade Practices Act</b>; damages against the defendants at
common law and various other consequential relief.
<P>

39	The Amended Summons of 20 March 1997 sought a declaration that the interest
of the deceased in the two properties was encumbered
under the mortgages to the
extent of the amounts referred to in the existing Further Amended Summons,
which I have quoted.  It nextly
sought declarations that Westpac was guilty of
fraud and of conduct in breach of s.51AA of the <b>Trade Practices Act</b> and
declarations that the other defendants were also guilty of conduct in breach of
s.51AA of that Act.  The Summary of Contentions
continued the allegation that
Westpac was guilty of fraud in advancing further moneys to Mr Sialepis "knowing
that Tsatsoulis' signature
on the loan documentation and the mortgage
documentation had been forged".  Once again forgery was of central importance
to the allegations
raised.
<P>

40	The Third Further Amended Summons acknowledged the obligation of the estate
to repay the moneys to which I have referred and
alleged that Mr Sialepis had
bribed Mr Kay for his financial advantage and to induce Mr Kay to make
financial advances to him and
Sialepis Pty Limited "substantially in excess of
the first defendant's lending policy ...".  It was alleged that Mr Kay had
acted
corruptly in soliciting a bribe to persuade Mr Sialepis to pay him
$100,000 "as a secret commission or brokerage fee".  The allegation
thus made
related to bribery and unconscionable conduct.
<P>

41	The next Further Amended Summons was based upon bribery, the allegation of
forgery having, by then, been abandoned.  This occurred
in circumstances where
the expert evidence showed there was, in all probability, no truth in the
allegation  Once again the thrust
of the allegations was to the effect that
unbeknown to him the deceased had entered into mortgages, which also secured
the indebtedness
of Mr Sialepis and his companies with the consequences that
the deceased was made liable for such indebtedness.
<P>

42	On 12 December 1997 I refused the plaintiffs leave to file the Further
Amended Summons based on bribery and that then brings
one to the present
Further Amended Summons filed on 18 June 1998, which has as its core another
allegation of gross impropriety,
namely conspiracy.
<P>

<b>The Facts</b>
<P>

43	Before examining the Further Amended Summons I propose to consider the
facts, which were proved by the evidence tendered on behalf
of Westpac without
objection and which were not challenged.  I do so against the background of the
concession in paragraph 1 of the
Nature of Dispute in the Further Amended
Summons that the deceased agreed to purchase Mr Thibou's half interest in the
Rutherford
property and to increase the partnership borrowings from Westpac to
about $400,000 to purchase that half share and further develop
the property,
and the further concession that mortgages were granted to Westpac to secure
those borrowings.  Mr Dowdy, not unnaturally,
relied heavily upon these
concessions as showing that the deceased intended to borrow $400,000 from
Westpac for the purpose of acquiring
Mr Thibou's one half interest in the
Rutherford property and developing it.  Accordingly, so he submitted, there
could be no issue
that the deceased was not aware of what he was doing or why
he was doing it at least to that extent and, in the absence of any claim
upon
the deceased for an amount in excess of $400,000, the plaintiffs could not
demonstrate that the deceased or his estate had suffered
any damage, even if
they could prove the fundamental facts on which they sought to rely.
<P>

44	The principal affidavit that Mr Dowdy read was that of Mr William John
Maiden sworn 23 October 1998.  Mr Maiden annexed a number
of documents to which
it is appropriate to refer.
<P>

45	The first is a diary note of 18 November 1988 relating to the acquisition by
Mr Sialepis and the deceased of the Newcastle property.
 On 9 January 1989 Mr
Sialepis and the deceased signed a loan agreement for $145,000 and, on 22 March
1994, Westpac sent to the deceased
a copy of that agreement.  
<P>

46	On 31 January 1989 Mr Sialepis and the deceased opened an account with
Westpac at its Edgecliff Branch upon which either could
operate severally and,
on 3 February 1989, Mr Sialepis and the deceased gave Westpac Savings Bank
Limited a mortgage over the Newcastle
property, which mortgage secured any
indebtedness of either Mr Sialepis or the deceased "either alone or jointly
with any other person".
 In due course the amount of the loan was drawn down
and debited to the loan account in the name of Mr Sialepis and the deceased.
<P>

47	A valuation was furnished of the Rutherford property, when developed, from
L.J. Hooker stating the value would be $490,000. 
 
<P>

48	On 26 May 1992 Westpac wrote to Mr Sialepis, the letter being signed by Mr
Kay, confirming its formal approval to the request
for increasing borrowing
facilities for Sialepis Pty Limited, Mr Sialepis and the deceased.  In relation
to Mr Sialepis and the deceased
an investment property loan of $400,000 was to
be made to cover an existing loan of $130,000, an existing loan to Mr Sialepis
and
Mr Thibou of $70,000, the contribution of the deceased of $100,000 to buy
into the Rutherford property, and building costs for the
development of that
property of $100,000.  After the signature of Mr Kay there was typed an
acknowledgment of the receipt of the
original of the letter and an acceptance
of the terms and conditions and a further acknowledgment that the parties, who
ultimately
signed the letter, relied on their own judgment and had not relied
on any warranty or representation made by Westpac or its officers
before
entering into the agreement.  The statement went on to acknowledge other
matters including the high fixed interest rate and
an encouragement to seek
independent advice in relation to fixed rate borrowing.  In respect of Mr
Sialepis and the deceased the
properties mortgaged were Newcastle and
Rutherford.  The document was signed by Mr Sialepis and the deceased on 18 June
1992.  Schedule
D to the letter set forth the borrowings by Mr Sialepis and the
deceased.
<P>

49	On 30 June 1992 Mr Sialepis and the deceased signed a loan agreement with
Westpac for $400,000 providing for the drawing of principal
in instalments as
arranged with Westpac, and for repayments to be made by consecutive monthly
instalments payable on the twenty fifth
day of each calendar month commencing
on 25 July 1994, but prior to that interest was to be paid only.  Clause 10
provided the loan
was repayable on demand in certain events, including failure
to pay Westpac any money owing.  The document was signed by Mr Sialepis
and the
deceased.
<P>

50	Consideration was then given to the deceased acquiring the interest of Mr
Thibou and, by memorandum of transfer dated 11 August
1992, Mr Thibou and Mr
Sialepis transferred the Rutherford property to Mr Sialepis and the deceased as
tenants-in-common.  On 30
October 1992 Mr Sialepis and the deceased granted a
mortgage, registered number I565317, to Westpac Savings Bank Limited securing
the repayment of the sum of $400,000 or any other moneys owing by either of
them either alone or jointly with any other person.
<P>

51	On the same date Westpac took a mortgage from Mr Sialepis and the deceased
securing the repayment of $17,000 on the same basis.
<P>

52	On 4 November 1992 two officers of Westpac made a diary note in which they
recorded that Mr Sialepis and the deceased called
on 15 October and 30 October
1992 to execute mortgages over the Rutherford property to secure the facilities
in their joint names,
and that the officers attended the execution of the
security documentation.  The diary note continued:-
<P>

	<b>"Prior to execution/explanation of the mortgage, we handed a copy of the
memorandums of mortgage.  At the meeting we advised the following:-</b>
<P>

<b>	We insisted to each respectively that they take the mortgages to solicitors
for perusal and independent legal and financial advice,
however they declined
our offer, stating that they fully understood the nature of the documents they
were signing.</b>
<P>

<b>	The nature and effects of the mortgages.  That should they default on the
loan the Bank would have the power to sell the property
to recover all debts.
If after the sale funds remain owing, the Bank would look to them for repayment
of the outstanding and indeed
would pursue them to bankruptcy.</b>
<P>

<b>	The debts would include principal interest and all costs borne by the Bank
in obtaining full repayment.</b>
<P>

<b>	The all monies clause was explained, i.e. liability included both past,
present and future debts that the debtor might incur by themselves
or jointly
with another party.  This included both direct and contingent
liabilities.</b>
<P>

<b>	The mortgage also extended to cover the debts of the mortgagor as
well.</b>
<P>

<b>Andrew Puga asked separately at each interview if they had any questions and
if they understood their obligations to which they said
they fully understood
at these matters.</b>
<P>

<b>We also explained that the GX Guarantee would be paid unconditionally if the
Council demanded pay out.</b>
<P>

<b>Sam Tsatsoulis acknowledged he understood fully his obligations and
liabilities under the mortgage.</b>
<P>

<b>Harry confirmed he knew his liability and obligations and confirmed he has
had numerous explanations previously."	</b>
<P>

53	The diary note went on to set out certain action which was then taken by
Westpac's officers.  In respect of account 08-9227,
which was a loan account in
the name of Mr Sialepis and the deceased, it was shown as overdrawn to the
extent of $330,000 as at 9
December 1992.  In respect of account 83-1439 in the
names of the same parties it had a credit balance, as at 3 November 1992, of
$186,174.67 and, on 4 November 1992, a bank statement showed transfers by
authority of $70,000 and $100,000.  The $70,000 was used
to discharge the
indebtedness on the account in the name of Mr Sialepis and Mr Thibou and the
$100,000 was drawn by a cheque signed
by Mr Sialepis in favour of "Sialepis
Pty".  On 6 November 1992 Westpac wrote to Mr Sialepis and the deceased
advising that following
completion and execution of the security documentation
on 30 October 1992 it had drawn down $178,452.54 from the existing investment
property loan account 08.9227 and dispersed the proceeds as to $70,000 to clear
the account of Mr Sialepis and Mr Thibou, and $108,452.54
to the account of Mr
Sialepis and the deceased.  The letter stated that the remaining $100,000
required to complete construction
was to be drawn down against progress
payments.
<P>

54	On 5 July 1993 the loan account in the name of Mr Sialepis and the deceased
was overdrawn to the extent of $403,780.82 and, on
27 May 1993, Westpac wrote
to Mr Sialepis and the deceased in respect of account 08.9227 advising that as
the loan had been fully
drawn down repayments were to commence in the sum of
$4,700 on the fifth day of each month commencing on 5 July 1993.
<P>

55	On 24 February 1994 the deceased wrote to the manager of Westpac at
Edgecliff stating that on checking his bank statements in
respect of the joint
account with Mr Sialepis he had come across some entries of which he had no
details and of which he sought further
particulars.  He referred to the deposit
of $178,452.54 and a debit of $70,000.  On 9 March 1994 Westpac replied stating
that the
deposit was the credit proceeds and the partial drawing down of
investment property loan account number 08.9227 for $300,000, and
explaining in
some detail how this had been accomplished.  The letter continued that the
debit of $70,000 related partially to the
initial costs for the
acquisition/transfer of the vacant land at Rutherford.  A copy of cheque number
792138 for $100,000, which
was debited to the joint working account 83.1439 on
4 November 1992, was enclosed and it was stated "and which also obviously
relates
in some way to the acquisition/transfer of the Rutherford property to
you".  This is the $100,000 referred to in the Further Amended
Summons as
having been dealt with improperly by Westpac, but in respect of which no relief
is claimed.
<P>

56	After this explanation was given the deceased sought no further information,
the obvious inference being that he was satisfied
with the explanations, and,
on 4 May 1994, Westpac wrote to him referring to its letter of 7 July 1993, and
confirming that the monthly
"interest only" repayment arrangement expired on 30
June 1994, and that commencing on 25 July 1994 repayments of $4,535 per month
were required to cover principal and interest for the remaining thirteen years
of the loan.  It stated that the repayment amount
was based on the then
outstanding loan balance of $400,000 and a current variable interest rate of
9.75%.  It concluded:-
<P>

	<b>"To confirm your acknowledgment of the revised repayment arrangement please
sign and return to me the enclosed copy of this letter.
 Upon receipt of your
acknowledgment we will arrange to automatically debit the monthly payment
amount to your joint cheque account
No: 83.1439."</b>
<P>

57	The deceased signed an acknowledgment in the following terms:-
<P>

	<b>"I hereby acknowledge receipt of the original of this letter and accept the
terms and conditions applying to the revised monthly repayment
arrangement
commencing 25 July 1994 contained therein."</b>
<P>

That was dated 27 May 1994. 
<P>

58	On 1 September 1994 the deceased died and, on 9 March 1995, Westpac made a
written demand on each of the plaintiffs as executor
of the estate of the
deceased for payment of $409,560.54 stated to be due by the estate to it as at
1 March 1995.  The summary of
amounts showed that principal and interest was
owing under account number 08-9227 of $408,293.55, and principal and interest
was
owing under account number 83-1439 in the sum of $1,266.99.  A note to the
demand stated that the amount demanded did not include
other unpaid amounts
owing to Westpac "which may include principal, interests, costs and other
charges", and informed the recipient
that he and she would remain liable for
those amounts.
<P>

59	It was stated from the Bar table on a number of occasions by Mr Dowdy and Mr
Meek that no attempt had been or would be made by
Westpac or Trigamist to
recover from the estate of the deceased an amount in excess of $400,000
together with interest thereon, costs
and charges, and, particularly, although
this was inherent in that statement in any event, that there would be no
attempt to recover
from the estate any of the additional indebtedness of Mr
Sialepis or any of his companies, notwithstanding that on a proper construction
of the mortgages it was arguable that the money was recoverable from the
estate.  These matters have to be viewed in the light of
the concession that to
obtain relief under either the <b>Trade Practices Act</b> or the <b>Contracts
Review Act</b> the estate must pay the principal sum of $230,000 together with
interest.  The plaintiffs' Summary of Contentions makes no offer
to pay this
amount in return for the granting of the relief.
<P>

<b>The Summary of Contentions</b>
<P>

60	The Summary of Contentions in the Further Amended Summons must be read
together with the additional document, containing certain
amendments and
additions, handed up by Mr Howen on 25 February 1999.  My consideration of the
Summary of Contentions will include
the amendments and additions.
<P>

61	In paragraph 1 the parties are identified in an uncontroversial manner, save
for paragraph 1.4, in which it is pleaded that at
all material times Mr Kay was
an employee of and agent for Westpac "and at all material times acted in his
capacity as an officer
of" Westpac.  I say that this is not uncontroversial
because there is an allegation that Mr Kay conspired with certain parties to
injure the interests of the deceased and Westpac and, further, that Mr Kay
accepted bribes from Mr Sialepis.  A very real issue arises
as to whether Mr
Kay could have been acting within the scope of his actual or ostensible
authority in carrying out those activities
such as to make Westpac vicariously
liable for them.
<P>

62	In paragraph 2 the ownership of the land is pleaded and, in paragraph 3, it
is pleaded that in 1989 the deceased and Mr Sialepis
entered into a mortgage
over the Newcastle property in favour of Westpac to secure an advance of
$130,000.  No point was taken that
the mortgage was entered into with Westpac
Savings Bank Limited.
<P>

63	In paragraph 4 it is pleaded that Mr Sialepis was the managing director and
major shareholder of Sialepis Pty Limited of which
the deceased was neither a
director nor shareholder and, in paragraph 5, that Mr Sialepis was the
registered proprietor of the Rutherford
property as a tenant-in-common in equal
shares with Mr Thibou.
<P>

64	In paragraph 6 it continues that Mr Kay was the manager of Westpac's Branch
at Double Bay and, in paragraph 7, that in 1992 the
deceased and Mr Sialepis
resolved to expand their property partnership to extend to the deceased's
purchasing Mr Thibou's interest
in the Rutherford property financed by a
further advance from Westpac secured by a registered first mortgage over that
property.
<P>

65	In paragraph 8 it is pleaded that in May 1992 Mr Sialepis for himself or
Sialepis Pty Limited sought further substantial loan
capital from Westpac for
various business purposes in which the deceased had no interest.
<P>

66	The first substantive allegation is made in paragraph 9 in which it is
pleaded:-
<P>

	<b>"In 1992 Harry Sialepis, Greg Kay and other persons entered into a
conspiracy to act against the interests of both the first defendant
and the
deceased.  Furthermore, the conspiracy was executed causing the deceased to
suffer loss."</b>
<P>

It became clear from Mr Howen's submissions that Westpac was sought to be made
vicariously liable for these alleged activities of
Mr Kay, who was said to be
acting in his capacity as an officer of Westpac: paragraph 1.4.
<P>

67	By letter dated 8 July 1998 the solicitors for Mr and Mrs Cosco sought
particulars of the "other persons" to which the paragraph
referred.  The reply
was that Mr Smiles was one of the other conspirators, but that the plaintiffs
did not know the identity of any
other names "not already pleaded in the
Further Amended Summons".  Accordingly the named conspirators were Mr Sialepis,
Mr Kay and
Mr Smiles.  Neither Mr Sialepis nor Mr Kay is a defendant and Mr
Howen stated that it was not intended to join either as such.  Therefore
the
parties against which and whom damages are sought in relation to the
conspiracy, which conformably with principle would be on
a joint and several
basis, are Westpac and Mr Smiles.
<P>

68	Notwithstanding the terms of the pleading, by which I mean that Westpac is
pleaded as being a victim of the conspiracy, Mr Howen
submitted that it was
"possible" to make Westpac vicariously liable for the conduct of Mr Kay.  He
conceded that he was not submitting
that Mr Kay, in entering into the
conspiracy, was acting on the direction of the directors or any senior
employees of Westpac or
was otherwise expressly authorised by Westpac to enter
into conspiracies, let alone conspiracies against Westpac, but that Mr Kay
could have acted against Westpac's interests and it could be held liable for
the same conduct.  He did not elaborate on that submission
but continued that
if Westpac took the view that Mr Kay acted wrongly it could "bring Mr Kay in as
a third party".  He added that
if Westpac asserted that Mr Kay was responsible
it should cross-claim against him.  This, if I may say so with respect, is a
somewhat
extraordinary submission.  It became the more extraordinary when Mr
Howen conceded that it would be an absurd contention on the part
of the
plaintiffs to say that it was a contemplated part of Mr Kay's duties to enter
into conspiracies.  It becomes, if I may say
so with respect, more absurd when
it is appreciated that it is pleaded that as part of the consideration for
doing so Mr Kay accepted
bribes.
<P>

69	Mr Howen's submission was that it was within the scope of Mr Kay's authority
to deal with loan applications, to prepare security
documents, and to handle
mortgages.  He continued that Mr Kay used his position and this authority to
enter into transactions "to
facilitate the conduct of a conspiracy".
Undoubtedly an employer may be liable for the wrongful, even fraudulent,
conduct of its
employees if it has either expressly authorised them, or if the
wrongful conduct is carried out by an employee carrying out activities,
which
he or she has ostensible authority to do.  In this case it was conceded that Mr
Kay had no actual authority.  It is not asserted
that he had any ostensible
authority or, if such a submission was made, that this is a case where the
deceased was aware of that.
 There was no holding out by Westpac of Mr Kay to
the deceased as having authority to do anything.  The deceased did not deal
with
Mr Kay.
<P>

70	In his written submissions Mr Howen seemed to accept that Mr Kay could not
enter into a conspiracy in the course of his employment
and then to reject that
proposition.  He wrote:-
<P>

	<b>"1.1	It is not contended that Mr Greg Kay or any other officer of the first
defendant was expressly authorised or directed to enter
into any conspiracy
with an unlawful object.  Furthermore it is not contended that Mr Greg Kay or
any other officer of the first
defendant was expressly authorised or directed
to commit any act of dishonesty or to make any representation inconsistent with
their
duties on behalf of the first defendant in administering the
banker/customer relationship with the deceased.  In other words, the
scope and
nature of Mr Greg Kay's duties did not include performing any fraudulent acts
or entering into any conspiracies.</b>
<P>

<b>	1.2	I submit that notwithstanding para 1.1 above the first defendant is
liable for the acts of its employees where those acts are
within the ambit of
the employees' duties.  The nature of the duties, the extent of authority
conferred on the employee, and the
level of supervision are matters for
evidence and findings of fact by the trial judge."</b>
<P>

71	An employer is vicariously liable for the acts of his employee where the
employee commits a tortious act in the course of his
employment in
circumstances where the employee is acting within the scope of his or her
actual or ostensible authority.  In his written
submissions Mr Dowdy wrote:-
<P>

	<b>"An employer is not liable merely because the employment gives an
opportunity to an employee to commit fraud or other tortious acts":
paragraph
10.</b>
<P>

In his oral submissions Mr Howen accepted that this correctly stated the
law.
<P>

72	In my opinion, if Mr Kay entered into a conspiracy he was engaging in a
"frolic of his own".  It is conceded by Mr Howen that
he was not expressly
authorised to do so; there is no suggestion that it was within his ostensible
authority; it is pleaded that
in doing so he was acting contrary to the
interests of Westpac, which is totally inconsistent with his acting in
circumstances where
Westpac could be vicariously liable; and further in
particulars furnished it was conceded that the deceased never relevantly
attended
the premises of Westpac and never met Mr Kay at any material time.
The purpose of these observations is not to suggest that Mr Kay
could not have
conspired with other persons, but to demonstrate that, as a matter of law, Mr
Kay could not have done so in circumstances
where he made Westpac vicariously
liable for his conduct.  
<P>

73	Circumstances in which an employer may be vicariously liable for the acts of
an employee were considered in <b>Deatons Pty Limited v Flew</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1949/60.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1949] HCA 60</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281949%29%2079%20CLR%20370" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1949) 79 CLR
370.</a>  At p.378 Latham CJ said:-
<P>

	<b>"Liability of the employer depends upon the scope of employment of the
barmaid and the authority which her employment conferred upon
her, such
authority to be exercised on behalf of the employer.  An employer is liable for
the act of his servant only if the act
is shown to come within the scope of the
servant's authority either as being an act which he was employed actually to
perform or
as being an act which was incidental to his employment."</b>
<P>

At p.379 his Honour continued:-
<P>

	<b>"Upon the evidence given for the defendant the act was an act of personal
resentment and was not in any way performed as on behalf
of the employer.  It
was not done even in supposed furtherance of the interests of the employer.  In
doing what she did the barmaid
was, as Isaacs J said in <i>Bugge v Brown</i>
acting so `as to be in effect a stranger in relation to (her) employer with
respect to the act (she) has committed, so that the act
is in law the
unauthorised act of a stranger'.  In my opinion the act of the barmaid was not
expressly authorised, it was not so
connected with any authorised act as to be
a mode of doing it, but was an independent personal act which was not connected
with or
incidental in any manner to the work which the barmaid was employed to
perform."</b>
<P>

74	At p.381 Dixon J said:-
<P>

	<b>"Nor is it one of those wrongful acts done for the servant's own benefit
for which the master is liable when they are acts to which
this ostensible
performance of his master's work gives occasion or which are permitted under
cover of the authority the servant is
held out as possessing or of the position
in which he is placed as a representative of his master. ..</b>
<P>

<b>	The truth is that it was an act of passion and resentment done neither in
furtherance of the master's interests or under his express
or implied authority
nor as incident to or in consequence of anything the barmaid was employed to
do."</b>
<P>

75	Mr Howen's submissions seemed to proceed on the basis that Mr Kay was
employed to carry out financial transactions and to obtain
security documents
and, accordingly, if he entered into a conspiracy to bring about a result
different from that anticipated by the
other party, namely the deceased, that
was sufficiently incidental to the activities, which he was employed to carry
out, to make
Westpac vicariously liable.  In the absence of actual authority,
which was conceded by Mr Howen, it would be necessary for the deceased
to
establish that Mr Kay had ostensible authority.  However, not only is such a
case not pleaded, although I am prepared to infer
that perhaps it may be said
to arise from the matters stated, but on the particulars furnished it could
never succeed because the
deceased had no idea of any involvement by Mr Kay in
this matter.  In the answers to particulars it is stated:-
<P>

	<b>"(d)	The deceased never attended any premises of the first defendant for
the purposes of any meeting or discussion in relation to
the said loan from the
first defendant nor for the execution of any documents relating to the loan and
securities. <u> Furthermore, the deceased did not ever meet Mr Greg Kay at any
time material to the negotiation or approval of loans or the execution
of
documentation for loans from the first defendant</u>.</b>
<P>

<b>	(e)	In or about August 1992 Harry Sialepis met the deceased at the home of
Mary Tsatsoulis and requested the deceased to sign some
pagers unattached to
any loan documentation but which he represented to the deceased as being in
relation to a loan for the refinance
and development of the Rutherford and
Newcastle properties.  The deceased signed some unattached pages believing them
to be only
related to the refinance and development of the Rutherford and
Newcastle properties."   (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

76	Accordingly no case is pleaded that Westpac held Mr Kay out to the deceased
as having authority to do anything relevant to the
entry into the
transaction.
<P>

77	In delivering the opinion of the Privy Council in <b>Kooragang Investments
Pty Limited v Richardson &amp; Wrench Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%202%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 2 NSWLR 1</a> at pp.7 and
8 Lord Wilberforce said:-
<P>

	<b>"In the present case, R &amp; W did carry out valuations.  Valuations were
a class of acts which Rathborne could perform on their
behalf.  To argue from
this that any valuation done by Rathborne, without any authority from R &amp;
W, not on behalf of R &amp;
W but in his own interest, without any connection
with R &amp; W's business, is a valuation for which R &amp; W must assume
responsibility,
is not one which principle or authority can support.  To
endorse it would strain the doctrine of vicarious responsibility beyond
the
breaking point and in effect introduce into the law of agency a new principle
equivalent to one of strict liability."</b>
<P>

78	The facts of <b>Kooragang</b> were, in my opinion, stronger in favour of the
employer than in the present case in that there was some commercial advantage
to Westpac.
 But, in my opinion, the allegation of a conspiratorial agreement
supported by the allegation of the acceptance of bribes paid to
Mr Kay, in
circumstances adverse to the interests of Westpac, shows quite clearly that Mr
Kay was acting on a "frolic of his own",
if he did what he was alleged to have
done, such that Westpac could not be vicariously liable.  
<P>

79	The fact that what Mr Kay allegedly did was against the interests of Westpac
is made clear by paragraph 9.1, which was stated
by Mr Howen to be the pleading
of an overt act, namely to induce Westpac to provide various advances and
credit facilities to Mr
Sialepis and Sialepis Pty Limited substantially in
excess of Westpac's lending policy, which dictated the margin of loans that
could
be made having regard to the security and the identity of the borrower.
Accordingly, an overt act pleaded against the alleged conspirators
was one
which supported the pleading that the conspiracy was "to act" against the
interests of Westpac.
<P>

80	In paragraph 9.2 it was pleaded, as an overt act, that there was an
inducement to the deceased to agree to enter into a loan
agreement with
Westpac, which was fraudulently represented to the deceased as being a loan for
the purchase of Mr Thibou's interest
in the Rutherford property and for
advances to be made to Mr Sialepis in excess of the purchase consideration for
that property,
all secured by mortgages to Westpac on both the Rutherford and
Newcastle properties.  The fraudulent representation is particularised
as
having been made by Mr Sialepis at Mrs Tsatsoulis' home.  It is not alleged
that Mr Sialepis was acting on behalf of Westpac.
<P>

81	Mr Howen said this was not a term of the conspiratorial agreement but an
overt act, although on its own it was a lawful act,
which only became unlawful
if it was part of a wider conspiracy.  No "wider conspiracy" was alleged in
paragraph 9.  I think that
Mr Howen was seeking to say that other conspiracies
subsequently alleged created the "wider conspiracy".  On the other hand he
conceded
that those alleged conspiracies would not be established unless the
conspiracy alleged in paragraph 9 was proved.
<P>

82	Paragraph 9.3 needs to be quoted in full.  It states:-
<P>

	<b>"9.3	To induce the deceased to sign loan documentation which was then
fraudulently manipulated to be a loan agreement with the first
defendant for
the sum of $400,000 secured by mortgages on the properties, and securing all
other borrowings by Harry Sialepis from
the first defendant and liabilities by
Harry Sialepis to the first defendant.</b>
<P>

<b>	9.3.1	The deceased was induced to sign loan and security documentation in
blank.</b>
<P>

<b>	9.3.2	Without the consent or knowledge of the deceased part or all of the
documentation once signed by the deceased, was then copied
and those parts
which were copied were added to other documentation in a manner designed to
make it appear that the copied sections
were part of that documentation.</b>
<P>

<b>	9.3.3	Part or all of the documentation had other text added without the
knowledge or consent of the deceased creating materially
different
documentation to that the deceased intended to sign."</b>
<P>

83	This pleading, of course, is one of gross fraud.  However, it really goes
beyond the allegation of conspiracy.  It is one thing
to allege a conspiracy to
have a document signed, which has an effect different from that which the
deceased thought he was signing.
 It is quite a different thing to allege a
conspiracy to have a document signed in effect and relevantly in blank, which
document
will then be "fraudulently manipulated" in the ways alleged.  The most
cursory analysis shows that these are two quite different
allegations.
<P>

84	Mr Howen submitted that save for the words "to induce the deceased to sign
loan documentation", which was a term of the conspiratorial
agreement, the
balance of paragraph 9.3 were overt acts of the conspiracy pleaded in paragraph
9.  He stated that the fraudulent
manipulation was carried out by Mr Kay, Mr
Smiles and Mr Sialepis and that it occurred by inducing the deceased to execute
loan documentation,
which did not reflect his intention.  As I have pointed out
the pleading does not reflect this. Two separate allegations are made.
 There
is no particularisation other than that contained in paragraphs 9.3.1 and .2.
Mr Howen said that on his instructions the deceased
was induced to sign loan
and security documentation in blank and, once again on his instructions,
without the consent or knowledge
of the deceased part or all of the
documentation once signed by him, was then copied and those parts which were
copied were added
to other documentation in a manner designed to make it appear
that the copied sections were part of that documentation.  Mr Howen
said that
whilst he had instructions that evidence would be led to this effect it was not
possible to identify which of Mr Kay, Mr
Smiles or Mr Sialepis carried out the
conduct particularised in paragraph 9.3.2.  He also said that the added text
referred to in
paragraph 9.3.3 could not be identified, and that he would be
leading evidence of the additions to the documentation and, Tp.18,
that they
were made without the knowledge and consent of the deceased and created
materially different documentation to that which
he intended to sign.  I have
pointed out the differences in the two allegations, which the pleading does not
address.  The transcript
discloses:-
<P>

	<b>"HIS HONOUR: On your present instructions you have evidence on all those
matters.</b>
<P>

<b>	HOWEN: Yes your Honour."</b>
<P>

85	In my opinion, it is embarrassing for the defendants to be confronted with
these two separate allegations.  They are entitled
to know whether the
allegation is that the deceased was induced to sign a completed document, which
did not accord with his intention;
or whether he was induced to sign an
incomplete document, which was subsequently "fraudulently manipulated" so as
not to reflect
his intention.  The seriousness of these allegations demands
precise pleading.
<P>

86	In any event, the allegations of fraudulent manipulation make it clearer, in
my opinion, that Mr Kay, if he was engaged in any
such conduct, was not acting
in the course of his employment. Similarly the allegations in paragraph 9.3.2,
which would indicate
the copying of various parts of the documentation in the
manner therein particularised, reinforce this view, as do the matters pleaded
in paragraph 9.3.3.
<P>

87	The further particulars in paragraphs 9.4, 9.5, 9.6 and 9.7 are pleaded as
overt acts and, in paragraph 9.8, the pleading is
said to be of the intention
of the deceased.
<P>

88	In paragraphs 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 of his written submissions, Mr Howen
submitted that a corporation may be held vicariously liable
for a fraud
committed by one of its servants, despite the fact that the fraud or deceit may
involve the formation of a motive or
intent, and that an innocent principal may
be civilly responsible for the fraud of its authorised agent or servant acting
within
his authority to the same extent as if it was his own.  He further
submitted that it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to plead
and prove
intention on the part of Westpac to cause injury to the deceased, the issue
being an assessment of the employee's authority,
actions and intention.  For
reasons to which I shall refer this is not a correct statement of the law when
one is considering the
tort of conspiracy based on an agreement to perform a
lawful act in an unlawful way.  It must be there established that the
predominant
purpose was to injure the plaintiffs.  He continued that Westpac
received some benefit "from completed conspiracy" and, in paragraph
1.10, that
Westpac "can be a victim, beneficiary and be also vicariously liable for the
acts of its servants", which he characterised
as "for the acts of Mr Kay for
entering into a conspiratorial agreement".
<P>

89	Certain of the submissions made by Mr Howen are undoubtedly correct
depending upon the context.  However, in the present context,
at least qua
Westpac, it must be established that Mr Kay had either actual or ostensible
authority, or that the acts he did were
incidental to those for which he had
such authority.  It was conceded he had no actual authority and, in the absence
of the deceased's
knowing what role Mr Kay was playing any suggestion of
ostensible authority falls by the wayside. In my opinion it cannot be said
that
the entry into a conspiratorial agreement was an act incidental to those Mr Kay
was authorised to carry out.  Finally, it is
inconceivable that an act against
the interests of the employer, whereby the employer was induced to act to its
detriment, is one
for which the employer becomes, in the circumstances pleaded
in this case, vicariously liable.
<P>

90	The plaintiffs have elected not to join two of the three named conspirators,
namely Mr Sialepis and Mr Kay. They seek, presumably,
to recover damages for
the alleged conspiracy from Westpac, as being vicariously liable for the acts
of Mr Kay, and from Mr Smiles.
 In so far as it is a presumably relevant
consideration,  I disagree with the submission of Mr Howen that if Westpac
takes the view
that Mr Kay was acting wrongfully it is its duty to join him as
a cross-defendant.  The obligation undertaken by the plaintiffs,
on the present
pleading, is to prove a conspiracy of which Westpac, through Mr Kay, Mr
Sialepis and Mr Smiles were parties.  The
plaintiffs cannot seek to advance
that case on the hypothesis that Westpac will join Mr Kay.  Further, the
submission is at odds
with the fundamental basis on which the plaintiffs are
proceeding, viz that Mr Kay was acting on behalf of Westpac in circumstances
where Westpac is vicariously liable for his conduct.
<P>

91	In my opinion the facts as pleaded do not establish a case that Westpac is
vicariously liable for any wrongful conduct of Mr
Kay.  Therefore the pleading
does not disclose a triable issue, in the sense to which I have referred,
against Westpac and Mr Kay
is not a party.
<P>

92	A conspiracy must be an agreement to perform a lawful act unlawfully or to
perform an unlawful act.  In the present case the
plaintiffs' allegations
revolve around an agreement to have the deceased sign a mortgage or mortgages,
although, as I have sought
to point out, it is not clear whether they mean to
allege documents in a form other than he intended to sign or documents which,
because of  their nature, could be "fraudulently manipulated".  Whichever
approach is taken the asserted object was to have mortgages
signed.  That is
inherently a lawful activity.  In this context it only becomes a conspiracy if
it was performed unlawfully, i.e.
if the execution of the mortgages was
procured in an unlawful way.  There are two further essential elements that
must be alleged
in such circumstances.  Firstly, the plaintiffs must allege
that the conspiracy was carried out with the predominant purpose of causing
the
plaintiff injury and the overt acts must show that purpose.  Secondly, the
plaintiffs must allege that they have suffered damage.
 
<P>

<b>The Nature Of The Tort Of Conspiracy</b>
<P>

93	In the light of the pleading in the Further Amended Summons and certain of
the submissions made on behalf of the plaintiffs,
it is desirable to consider
the tort of conspiracy in some little detail.  It is convenient to start by
reference to certain texts.
<P>

94	In <b>Clerk and Lindsell on Torts</b> (17th Edition) (1995) the authors, at
paragraph 23-77, state:-
<P>

	<b>"The tort of conspiracy therefore takes two forms: conspiracy to use
unlawful means, and `conspiracy to injure'.  The latter does,
but the former
does not, require a predominant purpose to injure.  Liability for `conspiracy
to injure', where the acts would without
combination be lawful, forms a
qualification to the general rule that the mere agreement of many persons to
act in concert cannot
make the act of any one or more wrongful, if it would not
be wrongful when done by each alone independently."</b>
<P>

95	In paragraph 23-78 they continued:-
<P>

	<b>"The tort requires an agreement, combination, understanding, or concert to
injure, involving two or more persons."</b>
<P>

96	At paragraph 23-85 the authors consider combinations, which employ no acts
or means that are in themselves unlawful, commonly
known as "conspiracies to
injure".  They continued:-
<P>

	<b>"Everything here turns on the distinction `between the case where the
object is the legitimate benefit of the combiners and the case
where the object
is deliberate damage without any just cause'".</b>
<P>

97	In Fleming <b>"The Law of Torts"</b> (9th Edition) (1998) Professor Fleming
wrote, at p.175:-
<P>

	<b>"The critical issue, it was made clear, was the object and purpose of those
acting in concert.  If the `sole or predominant' motive
was to advance an
interest of their own rather than to cause injury to the plaintiff, it was not
actionable.  In particular, malice
in the sense of spite or ill-will, which has
often been touted as a decisive factor, was now banished from the scene: if the
defendants
acted in pursuit of a legitimate object, their combination was not
vitiated by glee at their adversary's expected discomfiture; conversely,
absence of malice was insufficient to establish that they had a just cause or
excuse."</b>
<P>

98	In <b>Winfield and Jolowicz on Torts</b> (14th Edition) (1994) the authors
said, at p.539:-
<P>

	<b>"The object or purpose of the combination must cause damage to the
plaintiff.  The test is not what the defendants contemplated as
a likely or
even an inevitable consequence of their conduct; it is `what is in truth the
object in the minds of the combiners when
they acted as they did?'"</b>
<P>

99	In Salmon and Heuston <b>"Law of Torts"</b> (21st Edition) (1996), at p.356,
the authors stated:-
<P>

	<b>"There are two forms of the tort conspiracy.  The first exists when two or
more persons agree to commit an act which would be lawful
if done by one person
but which is intended by the conspirators to do damage to the plaintiff, and
such damage is in fact caused.
 The plaintiff must prove actual personal or
financial loss."</b>
<P>

At p.358, in dealing with the first type of conspiracy, they said:-
<P>

	<b>"Before <i>Crofter</i> some had thought that a combination to do damage to
another was not actionable unless it was inspired by malice or malevolence.
But
it is now clear that the predominant intent to injure is not to be equated
with spite, vindictiveness or malevolence.  Although these
will often be
present.  The correct proposition is that if there is a predominant intent to
injure, and resultant damage, the conspiracy
is actionable unless there is some
justification." </b>
<P>

100	The present pleading in paragraph 9 does not assert that the alleged
conspirators entered into an agreement, combination, understanding,
or concert,
but rather that they "entered into a conspiracy".  Nor does it allege that they
entered into any such arrangement "to
injure".  The allegation is that they
entered into the arrangement "to act against the interests of both the first
defendant and
the deceased".  I appreciate that it is then proposed to be
pleaded that the conspiracy was executed "causing the deceased to suffer
loss".
However, that, as I understand the authorities, is not a sufficient allegation
to support the tort of conspiracy. The fact
that damage may flow from an
agreement, and that makes a large assumption in the present case in favour of
the plaintiffs, does not
mean that the agreement had the nature of a
conspiracy.  Not only must there be an agreement but it must be pleaded that
its predominant
purpose or intention was to damage the plaintiff and, further,
that damage was in fact caused.
<P>

101	Finally it is well recognised that the conspiracy must lead to damage.  The
Summary of Contentions fails, in my view, to set
forth any basis on which the
plaintiffs have suffered damage, although the particulars, to which I have
referred, make some attempt
to specify how damage was caused by rference to
lost opportunity.
<P>

102	In Volume 33 <b>"The Laws Of Australia"</b> sub-title 33.8 "Intentional
Torts", paragraph 80, it is stated that the tort of conspiracy may take two
forms, namely:-
<P>

<b>"(1)	an agreement or combination between two or more persons to commit a
lawful act with the predominant purpose of injuring or damaging
the plaintiff,
and the act is carried out and the purpose achieved; or</b>
<P>

<b>  (2)	an agreement or combination between two or more persons to commit an
unlawful act with an intention to injure the plaintiff
and the act is carried
out and the intention achieved."</b>
<P>

103	The present case is an example of the first type of conspiracy, it being
lawful to require, as the price for the making of a
loan, the giving of a
mortgage over real estate.  The plaintiffs' complaint, in so far as I
understand it, is that the deceased was
unaware when he executed the mortgage
that it not only secured his indebtedness but also the indebtedness of Mr
Sialepis and his
companies to unlimited amounts.  There is, as I have noted,
the further complaint that the document executed by the deceased made
no such
provision, but was executed in a form which enabled it to be "fraudulently
manipulated" to achieve the same result.  These
two positions only have to be
stated to make clear the difference between them.

<P>

	<b>"If, contrary to my judgment, the contention were correct that the gist of
the tort of conspiracy is the conspiratorial agreement
alone, it may be that
the plaintiff would be entitled to succeed on this preliminary issue.  In my
view, however, this contention
is plainly wrong; the gist of the tort of
conspiracy is not the conspiratorial agreement alone, but that agreement plus
the overt
act causing damage.  It is true that the crime of conspiracy is the
very agreement of two or more persons to effect an unlawful purpose,
and any
overt acts done in pursuance of the agreement are merely evidence to prove the
fact of the agreement.  But the tort of conspiracy,
however, is complete only
if the agreement is carried into effect so as to damage the plaintiff.
Accordingly, the acts done in pursuance
of the agreement are an integral part
of the tort: <i>Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co Limited v

<P>

	<b>"Regarded as a civil tort, however, conspiracy is a highly anomalous cause
of action.  The gist of the cause of action is damage to
the plaintiff; so long
as it remains unexecuted the agreement, which alone constitutes the crime of
conspiracy, causes no damage;
it is only acts done in execution of the
agreement that are capable of doing that.  So the tort, unlike the crime,
consists not of
agreement but of concerted action taken pursuant to the
agreement."</b>

At p.189 his Lordship continued:-
<P>

	<b>"The civil tort of conspiracy to injure the plaintiff's commercial

<P>

	<b>"In the light of the recent decision of the House of Lords in <i>Lonrho</i>
... the claim based on conspiracy can be dealt with shortly.  In that case it
was held unanimously that the scope of what was described
as the `anomalous'

agreement entered into by two or more persons
for the purpose not of protecting
their own interests, but of injuring the interests of the plaintiff: at p.189.
In order to be actionable
`injury to the plaintiff and not the self-interest of
the defendants must be the predominant purpose of  agreement in execution of
which the damage-causing acts were done': Ibid.</b>
<P>

<b>	In the present case if there was an agreement to which HPI and Mr Blackman

constituted an
actionable conspiracy, the predominant purpose was the self-interest of HPI and
Mr Blackman rather than injury to
USSC, although such injury may have been an
actual consequence, and therefore it would not have fallen within the limited
scope still
left to the tort of conspiracy by the above decision of the House
of Lords."</b>

107	In <b>Scottish Pacific Business Finance Pty Limited v Soundstage Australia
Limited &amp; Ors</b> (Federal Court of Australia - French J - 14 May 1993 -
unreported) his Honour considered a submission that the conspiracy plea was
inadequate and should be struck out.  He quoted from the Thirteenth Edition of
Bullen and Leake and Jacob's <b>"Precedents of Pleadings"</b> at
pp.221-222:-
<P>

	<b>"The gist of the tort of conspiracy is not the conspiratorial agreement to
injure alone, but that agreement plus the overt acts causing
damage
(<i>Marrinan v Vibart</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%201%20QB%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] 1 QB 234</a>, affirmed  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%201%20QB%20528" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] 1 QB 528).</a>  The
statement of claim should describe who the several parties to the conspiracy
are and their relationship with each other.  It
should allege the conspiracy
between the defendants giving the best particulars it can of the dates when or
dates between which the
unlawful conspiracy was entered into or continued, and
the intent to injure ..: there is no call for a general plea of `acting wrongly
and maliciously' (<i>Sorrell v Smith</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1925%5d%20AC%20700" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1925] AC 700</a> at 714) nor is that
sufficient.  It should state precisely the objects and means of the alleged
conspiracy to injure and the overt
acts which are alleged to have been done by
each of the alleged conspirators in pursuance of the conspiracy, and lastly,
the injury
and damage occasioned to the plaintiff thereby."</b>
<P>

His Honour continued:-
<P>

	<b>"In my opinion, the pleading in this case fails to specify the content of
the alleged agreement by reference to the agreed means whereby
injury was to be
caused to SPBF.  It is not good enough in that respect to refer to the earlier
paragraphs of the statement of claim
which at most describe some of what might
be termed overt acts.  In any event the overt acts relied upon should be
specified and
identified as such.  Importantly it is not clear what purpose is
served by the conspiracy plea beyond unnecessary complication and
expense.  It
is difficult to see how the plea could succeed if neither the claims under the

at p.271, Kaye and Beach JJ stated that the modern doctrine of tort conspiracy
was expressed and expanded upon in <b>Lonrho</b>.  Their Honours quoted the
passage from the speech of Lord Diplock, commencing at p.188, that the gist of
the cause of action is
damage to the plaintiff.  They continued:-
<P>

	<b>"It follows that a statement of claim pleading tortious conspiracy must
allege an agreement or combination between defendants to injure
or harm the
plaintiff, overt acts of the defendants in furtherance of the agreement or
combination, and consequential injury or damage
suffered by the plaintiff: see
Bullen and Leake and Jacobs, <i>Precedents of Pleading</i> (1975) (12th
Edition) p.341.  In the present case the allegations contained in paragraph 11
of the statement of claim constitute
a pleading of an agreement or combination
to injure the appellant.  For the purposes of the pleading summons, it may be
assumed that
the appellant, at the trial, would prove the existence of an
agreement or combination between the respondents to injure him in the
manner
alleged.  <u>However, the pleadings do not disclose a cause of action unless
the allegations of overt acts as pleaded are capable of sustaining
the
conclusion that the predominant purpose of the respondents' agreement was to
injure the appellant in the practice of his profession</u>."  (My
emphasis.)</b>
<P>

109	Their Honours held that as the overt acts pleaded did not amount to conduct
or could not be treated as having the predominant
purpose of injuring the
plaintiff, no cause of action for tortious conspiracy, as pleaded, could be
sustained.  On the matters pleaded
Ormiston J came to a different conclusion,
p.292, although not because he disagreed, as I read his reasons, with the
principles enunciated
by the majority.
<P>

110	In <b>The Council of the City of the Gold Coast v Pioneer Concrete (Q'ld)
Pty Limited &amp; Ors</b> (Federal Court of Australia - Drummond J - 26 June
1998 - unreported), his Honour adopted the statement of the majority in
<b>Little</b>, which I have quoted, as a correct exposition of the law.  Before
doing so he referred, at p.19, to the principles set forth in Volume
33 of
<b>"The Laws of Australia"</b> at paragraph 80 to which I have referred and,
after quoting from <b>Little</b>, he continued, at pp.19-20:-
<P>

	<b>"The overt acts which must be pleaded to complete a proper allegation of
conspiracy are acts which justify the inference that the
conspiracy exists:
<i>cf Adstream Building Industries </i> at 133."</b>
<P>

111	In the latest edition of Bullen and Leake and Jacobs, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 25</a>, the same
principles as those to which I have referred in the earlier editions are set
forth.
<P>

112	The pleading in paragraph 9, even allowing for the particulars furnished,
falls far short of the pleading required to support
a claim for tortious
conspiracy. 
<P>

113	There is no pleading of the agreement in the sense that there are no
allegations as to what it is agreed the conspirators would
or would not do save
"to act against the interests of both the first defendant and the deceased".
That, in my opinion, does not raise
an appropriate issue.  It must be alleged
that there was an agreement between the defendants to injure or harm the
plaintiff.  It
must further appear from the overt acts, which are pleaded in
paragraphs 9.1 to 9.7, that they are capable of sustaining the conclusion
that
the predominant purpose of the defendants' agreement was to injure the
deceased.  It must further be alleged that the deceased
sustained injury and
damage in consequence of the overt acts.
<P>

114	The first overt act pleaded in paragraph 9.1 is directed to the position of
Westpac and does not relate to any purpose, let
alone a predominant purpose, in
respect of the deceased.  The other overt acts upon which reliance is placed
address the question
of the deceased's entering into a loan agreement and loan
and security documentation, which had the effect not only of securing money
he
was borrowing from Westpac but the further indebtedness of Mr Sialepis and his
company.  A reading of the overt acts, and it is
to be noted that the pleading
does not identify them as such it being necessary for me to enquire of Mr Howen
how he characterised
paragraphs 9.1 to 9.8 and what the overt acts pleaded
were, leads me to the conclusion that the predominant purpose was not the
intent
to injure the deceased, but rather to obtain additional security for Mr
Sialepis and his companies and, thereby, increase the amount
they could borrow.
There is no pleading that at that point Mr Sialepis and his companies would not
be able to repay the moneys he
and they borrowed, nor that the interest of the
deceased in the properties would be in any way jeopardised.  The Further
Amended
Summons does not make the allegations of the relevant predominant
purpose necessary to found the tort of conspiracy against the deceased.
 In my
opinion, the pleading establishes as the predominant purpose the furnishing of
additional financial assistance to Mr Sialepis
and his companies.  Further, as
I said earlier, it does not provide a basis for alleging that Westpac was a
party to the conspiratorial
agreement, or vicariously liable for the alleged
actions of Mr Kay.  
<P>

115	The plaintiffs have not alleged that by virtue of the impugned conduct the
deceased or the plaintiffs suffered any injury or
damage, although they have
furnished some particulars.  The deficiency in this pleading is that Westpac is
the party alleged to have
caused the damage, but the pleading does not
establish that it was a party to the conspiracy.  Nor does it establish that
Westpac
had the requisite intent.  At the time that Westpac held the securities
and was the creditor its demand was limited to recovering
the amount borrowed
by the deceased.  There is no suggestion in the Further Amended Summons that
Trigamist, which now holds the securities,
has made any demand on the
plaintiffs in their role as executors of the deceased's estate. I have referred
to the only particulars
of damage.  The difficulty with this assertion of
damage is that each of the deceased and Mr Sialepis had mortgaged their
respective
interests in the properties.  If Mr Sialepis had fallen into default
the holder of the security could have invoked s.66G of the <b>Conveyancing Act
</b>1919 to effect a sale, and the position as between the deceased or the
plaintiffs would then have had to have been worked out.  However,
as the
plaintiffs concede the obligation to pay some $230,000, together with interest,
to the holder of the security it cannot be
assumed that damage of the type to
which reference is made would have occurred.
<P>

116	In my opinion, for all these reasons, the claim of conspiracy in paragraph
9 fails.  This is so whoever are alleged to be the
parties to it.
<P>

117	A second conspiracy is pleaded in paragraph 24, it being alleged that Mr
and Mrs Cosco and Mr Smiles, together with Mr Sialepis
and Mr Kay "and other
persons" "entered into a conspiracy to induce" Westpac "to assign the loan
portfolio relating to Harry Sialepis
to the second defendant at below market
value of the loans and supporting securities".
<P>

118	This allegation fails, in my opinion, for a number of reasons.  The most
that is alleged is that there was an assignment by
Westpac to Ironaid and,
subsequently, by Ironaid to Trigamist of the debt and security.  Whilst there
is lengthy pleading, particularly
in the amended document handed up by Mr
Howen, I am not satisfied that that pleads a conspiracy conformably with the
principles to
which I have referred.  Once again Westpac is pleaded as a victim
of the conspiracy, which would have to be characterised as one
to perform a
lawful act in an unlawful manner.  It does not appear from a consideration of
the overt acts that the predominant purpose
was to injure the deceased and/or
the plaintiffs.  Nor is it pleaded that any damage was caused. Mr Howen
understood this problem
and, at Tp.23, he said:-
<P>

	<b>"Now, I can see if the plaintiff fails to prove the first conspiracy to
execute the mortgage, there will be some difficulties, I submit,
to prove the
further assignments were a wrongful conspiracy."</b>
<P>

119	At Tp.26 the following transpired:-
<P>

	<b>"HOWEN: Although I have covered some of this already, just in relation to
some of the submissions of the other defendants, in dealing
with the second and
third conspiracies, they are matters concerning the other defendants.  I have
already made some submissions in
relation to that.</b>
<P>

<b>	HIS HONOUR: Once again it turns on whether you have properly pleaded the
first conspiracy.</b>
<P>

<b>	HOWEN: Yes, and whether it can be proved.</b>
<P>

<b>	HIS HONOUR: That will depend if you get to trial on this pleading, whether
you win.  The first matter we have got to decide is whether
you get to trial on
this pleading.</b>
<P>

<b>	HOWEN: Yes, your Honour."</b>
<P>

120	Because of the view to which I have come in relation to the first
conspiracy I am of the opinion that it is unnecessary to further
consider the
subsequent conspiracies because of the concession made by Mr Howen. Mr Howen's
concession also covered allegations of
unconscionable conduct.  However, in
saying that, I have had regard to them and I am of the view, essentially for
the reasons I have
given, that the claims as pleaded are not sustainable.
<P>

<b>Some Other Matters</b>
<P>

121	There is a reference in paragraph 20 to the sum of $100,000 but, as I
pointed out to Mr Howen, no relief has been sought in
relation to that and, in
any event, it seems tolerably clear from the evidence that the matter was dealt
with in the adjustment of
the financial rights between the parties with the
full knowledge and concurrence of the deceased.
<P>

122	So far as the assignment is concerned there is various pleading based on
the provisions of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></b> it being alleged, in paragraph
31, that the third defendant, Mr Cosco, made certain representations to
Westpac, which were false
and as a consequence of which the assignment was
made, which would not otherwise have been made.  This seeks to raise a case as
between
the defendants from which in some unarticulated way the deceased and/or
the plaintiffs can take a benefit.  The failure to specify
the reason leads me
to the conclusion that the pleading must fail.  It is not suggested that any
representations were made to the
deceased and, accordingly, it is not suggested
that the deceased acted in reliance upon any representations.  It is pleaded
that
had the assignment not taken place Ironaid would not have been in a
position to have collected the rents and obtained other benefits
from the
mortgaged properties, although the relief sought in relation to this is not
tenable.
<P>

123	There is a further allegation that Westpac has engaged in unconscionable
conduct within the meaning of s.51AA(1) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></b> and
that it has, in trade and commerce, engaged in conduct that was misleading and
deceptive and was likely to mislead and/or deceive
within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.52</a>
of that Act.  There is added, in paragraph 45, the bald assertion that in the
alternative Westpac has conspired with the persons
named "in the facts above to
defraud the deceased".  In paragraph 46 it is pleaded that Westpac was
negligent towards the deceased
in respect of the management of the customer
relationship with him, and the execution and management of the loans the
security for
which the deceased provided.  The pleading does not set forth any
facts to support paragraphs 43 to 46 inclusive.  Mr Howen submitted
this was
not necessary.  I disagree.  In my opinion the Practice Note clearly requires
such material to be articulated.  The position
is, in my opinion, that a
pleading in this form is clearly embarrassing and vexatious in that it fails to
identify the case the defendants
are called on to meet.  For these reasons
paragraphs 43 to 46 inclusive should be disallowed.
<P>

124	The last series of allegations allege that the loan agreement between
Westpac, Mr Sialepis and the deceased, and the mortgage
granted by Mr Sialepis
and the deceased to Westpac, were unjust within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7</a> of the
<b>Contracts Review Act</b> in so far as they are concerned with the deceased's
one half share as tenant-in-common in the properties.  It is pleaded that the
deceased was commercially inexperienced in respect of the purchase of
investment properties; that he was not a party to any negotiations
as to the
provisions of the loan; that he did not receive any independent legal advice in
relation to the transactions; that no officer
of Westpac nor Mr Sialepis
explained the effect of the contract to him; that Westpac allowed Mr Sialepis
to arrange for the execution
of the loan documents rather than having them
executed on bank premises under the supervision of an officer of Westpac; and
that
the deceased did not know of the true nature of the loan agreements and
neither were they explained to him prior to signing any documents.
 Certain of
those allegations are at odds with the uncontradicted evidence tendered and to
which I have referred.
<P>

125	That evidence establishes, at least prima facie, that the mortgages were
explained to the deceased.  However, assuming for the
moment that there is some
validity in the claim under s.7, it is expressly made subject to the repayment
of the specified amounts
and interest thereon.  There is no offer in the
pleadings to repay these amounts and there is no evidence that the plaintiffs
are
able to do so.  Further, heavy reliance is placed upon the fact that the
agreements into which the deceased entered were precisely
the agreements set
out in paragraph 1 of the Nature of Dispute, save for the security granted in
relation to Mr Sialepis and his
companies.  At a factual level the claim would,
prima facie, confront serious difficulties.  However, it may not be possible to
say
it is hopeless.
<P>

126	A substantial legal problem, which the claim under the <b>Contracts Review
Act</b> faces, is s.6(2) thereof, which provides:-
<P>

	<b>"A person may not be granted relief under this Act in relation to a
contract so far as the contract was entered into in the course
of or for the
purpose of a trade, business or profession carried on by him or proposed to be
carried on by him ..."</b>
<P>

127	I asked Mr Howen what submission he proposed to make having regard to
s.6(2).  At Tp.27 he said:-
<P>

	<b>"HOWEN: I concede that the Contracts Review Act is not a statute which is
designed, by some exclusion of commercial transactions,
to ordinarily deal with
business and commercial transactions.</b>
<P>

<b>	HIS HONOUR: Do you say these are business and commercial transactions
involved in this case?</b>
<P>

<b>	HOWEN: There is a difficulty of characterising it, because Mr Tsatsoulis
never intended to enter into a business and commercial transaction
relating to
providing support for any other loan, cross-collateralisation issue.</b>
<P>

<b>	HIS HONOUR: We have been through that.</b>
<P>

<b>	HOWEN: My only submission is, having never intended to do that, he had no
intention to enter into a business and commercial transaction
in relation to
that aspect of the Sialepis empire.</b>
<P>

<b>	HIS HONOUR: The Union Street and Rutherford properties were business
properties.  It was all part of the venture; stated by you in
paragraph 1 to be
part of the venture.  All I am saying is, do you assert these were not business
and commercial transactions?</b>
<P>

<b>	HOWEN: I assert that the late Mr Tsatsoulis did not intend to enter into
business and commercial transactions relating to what ultimately
were the
documents.  There was evidence to support the contention that there was a
business relationship in relation to the Rutherford
and Union Street
properties, but is arguable, I submit, that that is not what Mr Tsatsoulis
intended to do."</b>
<P>

128	In <b>Australian Bank Limited v Stokes &amp; Anor</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20NSWLR%20174" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 NSWLR 174</a>
Rogers J considered the effect of s.6(2).  At p.176 his Honour said that that
sub-section excluded the operation of the Act:-
<P>

	<b>".. if a trader enters into the contract in the course of or for the
purpose of the trade, business or profession carried on.  Prima
facie, the
defendants were not carrying on any relevant trade, business or profession;
they were utilising the form of enterprise
known as the limited company for the
purpose of engaging in a business activity."</b>
<P>

129	In the present case I am not confronted with the difficulty to which his
Honour referred because there is no doubt that the
deceased was the person
carrying on the business in relation to the two properties.  In those
circumstances sub-s.(2) precludes the
granting of relief to a person in
relation to a contract entered into in the course of or for the purpose of a
trade or business
carried on by him or proposed to be carried on by him.  The
answer to the submission made by Mr Howen is that the Act could only
operate if
it was found that the contract was "unjust" in the circumstances relating to it
when it was made.  Mr Howen's submission
must be that because the mortgage went
beyond that intended by the deceased that made it unjust.  Had the mortgage not
been entered
into in the course of or for the purpose of the deceased's
business then there would, in my opinion, undoubtedly have been an argument
available to the deceased and, I shall assume, to the plaintiffs, that the
contract was unjust.  I say nothing about the prospects
of that claim
succeeding having regard to the concessions made in paragraph 1 of the Nature
of the Dispute and the evidence.  However,
the provisions of the Act do not
allow for relief to be granted in the circumstances.  Hence the claim for
relief under the <b>Contracts Review Act</b> must fail.
<P>

130	In any event it seems to me that it would be necessary to plead a
willingness to bring into Court the amount admittedly due
as the price for the
obtaining of that relief as a condition of allowing the pleading to go forward.
There would be absolutely no
point in the Court considering the factual issues
raised by that claim for relief unless the plaintiffs could satisfy the Court,
which they have made no attempt to do, that they can comply with the conditions
specified in the order they seek.  For all these
reasons, I consider there is
no triable issue in relation to the <b>Contracts Review Act</b> claim.
<P>

131	In paragraph 48 it is pleaded that in taking an assignment of the loans and
securities Ironaid and Trigamist engaged in unconscionable
conduct within the
meaning of s.51AA(1) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></b> and, in paragraph 49,
that Mr and Mrs Cosco and Mr Smiles were persons who aided and abetted that
contravention pursuant to s.75B(1)(a)
and (c) of the Act.  In paragraph 50 an
order is sought under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.87(2)</a> setting aside all mortgages in respect of the
properties to the extent necessary to protect the interest of the deceased.
That order
is sought subject to the payment of the amounts to which I have
referred.
<P>

132	Section 51AA(1) provides that a corporation must not, in trade or commerce,
engage in conduct that is unconscionable within
the meaning of the unwritten
law, from time to time, of the State and Territories.  As I understood Mr
Howen's submissions the unconscionability
necessarily refers back to the
original allegation of conspiracy, the allegation of unconscionability being
that the conduct involved
in the original conspiracy, of which it is alleged
Ironaid and Trigamist had knowledge through their directors Mr and Mrs Cosco
and
through Mr Smiles, made the conduct in taking the assignment of the debts
and mortgages unconscionable.  It is conceded that these
allegations turn upon
my finding as to the original conspiracy.  As I am of the view that the
original conspiracy has not been made
out, at a pleading level, it is
unnecessary to further pursue them
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

133	For all these reasons I am of the opinion that the plaintiffs should not be
granted leave to rely upon the Further Amended Summons
filed on 19 June 1998
together with the amendments proposed to be incorporated by the document handed
up by Mr Howen on 25 February
1999.
<P>

134	The question which then arises is whether the plaintiffs should be granted
leave to re-plead.  The matters to which account
should be taken in considering
this were referred to by the Court of Appeal in <b>Sialepis v Ironaid Pty
Limited &amp; Ors</b> (Court of Appeal - 10 December 1997 - unreported).  At
p.13 Gleeson CJ said:-
<P>

	<b>"Following the delivery by Rolfe J of his reasons for dismissing the action
against the three respondents, Senior Counsel for the
appellant applied to his
Honour for leave to further amend the pleading.  This would have been the
seventh version of the claim,
which had been further amended on the day of the
argument before Rolfe J, but before he gave judgment.  It appears that the
proposed
amendments were not formulated and, indeed, they had still not been
formulated at the commencement of the hearing of the present
appeal.  During
the course of the appeal this Court rejected an application for further
amendment.  That is the subject of a separate
judgment.  The decision of Rolfe
J not to permit further amendment was an appropriate discretionary decision.
The appellant had far
more than ample opportunity to formulate a viable claim
against the respondent if one existed.  The difficulty which the appellant's
lawyers had experienced in framing a plausible statement of her cause of action
against the respondents is a good indication that,
on the facts known to them,
or which they can realistically expect to prove, there is no cause of
action."</b>
<P>

Handley and Cole JJA agreed.
<P>

135	In the present case the history discloses that the plaintiffs have had more
than ample opportunity to plead a viable cause of
action, if there be one,
against the present defendants.  I have traced the history of the pleading and
I do not propose to repeat
it.  Suffice to say that many serious allegations
have been made and they have not been able to be established even at a pleading
level. I would add that my reasons of 27 May 1998, particularly at pp.8-10,
made clear to the plaintiffs and their legal representatives
that the matter
could not be allowed to proceed in the unsatisfactory way it had. As I have
pointed out the proceedings have now
been on foot for over two years and the
originating process has gone through many variations and, in my opinion, save
for one matter,
a proper exercise of discretion demands that the plaintiffs be
refused leave to plead further.  
<P>

136	In considering this application I consider the Court must also have regard
to the position of the defendants.  I referred to
this in my reasons of 27 May
1998.  The plaintiffs have made a series of very serious allegations against
them over a long period.
 They have been forced to consider these allegations
and they have successfully established that the claims cannot be sustained,
even at a pleading level.  This has no doubt caused considerable expense.
However, it must also be a matter of deep personal concern
to the individuals
against whom the unsustainable allegations are made.  In the absence of a
viable pleading these are matters which,
in my opinion, the Court should take
into account in exercising its discretion.  
<P>

<b>The One Matter</b>
<P>

137	When Mr Howen brought in his further amendments to the Further Amended
Statement of Claim on 25 February 1999, which included
paragraphs 9.3.1, .2 and
.3, Mr Dowdy read the affidavit of Mr David Winston Low of 8 May 1998 for the
purpose of putting into evidence
the report of the forensic document examiners,
Chris Anderson &amp; Co Pty Limited, dated 25 September 1997.  It was this
report,
which was prepared by Mr Anderson and which was substantially
destructive of the case that the signatures of the deceased were forged.
However, in it Mr Anderson dealt with certain other matters.  I shall set out
the report and certain parts of the appendix:-
<P>

<b>"RE: THE ESTATE OF THE LATE SAM TSATSOULIS v WESTPAC &amp; ORS - SUMMARY
REPORT</b>
<P>

<b>	I refer to your letter of the 22 September 1997 requesting an urgent
comparative examination of the documents listed in Appendix
`A'.</b>
<P>

<b>	The purpose of this examination was to determine whether or not the writer
of the S Tsatsoulis signatures on the specimen signatures
referred to in items
12 to 19 wrote the S Tsatsoulis signatures on the questioned documents referred
to in items 1, 2, 4 to 10.</b>
<P>

<b>	<u>Items 2, 3 and 11</u></b>
<P>

<b>	Items 3 and 11 are photocopies of item 2.  Neither item 3 or item 11 are an
exact copy or replication of item 2.  Item 3 is missing
page 4, four pages of
Schedule `A', two pages pf Schedule `B', one page of Schedule `C' and has three
pages comprising of Schedule
`D', where item 2 has only two pages for Schedule
`D'.</b>
<P>

<b>	Page 3 of Schedule `D' on item 3 contains a typed signature block,
signatures `H Sialepis' and `S Tsatsoulis' and a date `18 6 92'.
 The typed
signature block, these signatures and the date are identical to the last typed
signature block, H Sialepis and S Tsatsoulis
signatures and the date `18 6 92'
on page 4 of item 2.  As item 2 is an original document with original typed
entries, original H
Sialepis and S Tsatsoulis signatures and an originally
written date, <u>the signatures appearing on page 3 of Schedule `D' on item 3
have been copied from the page 4 of item 2.  In other words, neither
Mr
Sialepis nor Mr Tsatsoulis signed on the original of page 3 of Schedule `D' as
it purports</u>.</b>
<P>

<b>	Item 11 is almost identical to item 2, except that item 11 has three pages
comprising of Schedule `D', whereas on item 2 there are
only two pages
comprising of Schedule `D'.  Page 3 of Schedule `D' on item 11 does not have
the signature block or signatures that
are evidence on this page on item
3.</b>
<P>

<b>	It has also been noted that page 2 of Schedule `D' on item 2 has a footer
`.../3' which indicates there is page 3 to follow.  This
footer is also
reproduced on items 3 and 11.</b>
<P>

<b><u>Item 4</u></b>
<P>

<b>	I have also been provided with a photocopy of this document that was sent
by Westpac to Mr Tsatsoulis on the 9 March 1994.  See Appendix
`B' for a copy
of this document.  It has been noted that on the second page of this document
there are no details when the loan is
to be repaid, whereas on the original
document (item 4) the following details have been written</b>
<P>

<b>		`25</b>
<P>

<b>		 25 JULY 94'</b>
<P>

<b> 	Ink differentiation tests using the Video Spectral Comparator reveal that
the ink used rule out the lines in the Repayments section
of this document is
different to the ink to write the entries</b>
<P>

<b>		`25</b>
<P>

<b>		25 JULY 94'</b>
<P>

<b>	See Appendix `C' for video prints highlighting the ink
differentiation.</b>
<P>

<b>	<u>This indicates that these entries were written at a later time to when
areas of the document were ruled out</u>.  However, it is indeterminate when
these entries where written compared to the ruling out on the document.</b>
<P>

<b>Due to the limited time provided for this examination I have not conducted
all the necessary examinations.  These include ESDA examinations
of the
questioned documents for latent indentation impressions and a detailed
examination of the stapled documents to determine if
all staple holes of the
pages of the documents match.  If I am given the time these examinations can be
undertaken.</b>
<P>

<b>A microscopic and macroscopic examination was conducted on the S Tsatsoulis
signatures referred to in items 1, 2, 4 to 10 and 12 to
19 using a
stereomicroscope as an aid.  In the first instance I satisfied myself that all
the S Tsatsoulis signatures on the specimen
documents were written by the same
person.  Then I conducted a side by side (juxtaposition) comparison between the
questioned and
specimen signatures.</b>
<P>

<b>As a result of these examinations I am of the opinion that the writer of the
S Tsatsoulis signatures on the specimen documents referred
to in items 12 to 19
probably wrote the S Tsatsoulis signatures on the questioned documents referred
to in items 1, 2, 4 to 10.</b>
<P>

<b>This is a qualified conclusion in which I am satisfied the evidence
contained in the signatures points rather strongly towards the
questioned and
specimen signatures having been written by the same individual; however, it
falls short of the `<i>virtually certain</i>' degree of confidence.  The
limitation being the lack of contemporaneous specimen signatures.</b>
<P>

<b>This opinion is based solely on the material supplied for this
examination.</b>
<P>

<b>Trusting this information is of assistance to you in your enquiry.  Please
do not hesitate in contacting me if you have any further
queries.</b>
<P>

<b>Documents are returned."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

138	Item 2 in the Schedule is a thirteen page letter addressed to "Mr Harry
Sialepis" on Westpac Banking Corporation letterhead
and dated 26 May 1992,
containing on page 4 a signature "S. Tsatsoulis".  Items 3 and 11 are stated as
being:-
<P>

<b>"3.	Photocopy of eight pages of letter addressed `Mr Harry Sialepis' on
Westpac Banking Corporation dated 26 May 1992 <u>containing on page 8 a
photocopy signature `S Tsatsoulis'</u>.  Note that this is a part photocopy of
the document referred to in item 2 and was purportedly received by Sam
Tsatsoulis from Mr
Greg Kay the Commercial Manager Westpac Bank, Double Bay and
enclosed with a letter dated the 9 March 1994.</b>
<P>

<b>                ................</b>
<P>

<b>11.	Photocopy of fourteen page letter addressed to `Mr Harry Sialepis' dated
26 May 1992.  This document is on the whole, a photocopy
of the document
referred to in item 2.  The document being part of a bundle of photocopy
documents sent by Minter Ellison under the
cover of a letter dated 25 May 1995
to Briggs Paul &amp; Dowding."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

139	The point of referring to this report is that it demonstrates that, on a
hurried consideration, Mr Anderson was able to ascertain
matters in some of the
documents, which provide some foundation for the matters raised in paragraphs
9.3.2 and.3.  I appreciate that
Mr Anderson's view is only a prima facie view,
and that the matters particularised do not give rise, in my opinion, to the
cause
of action in support of which they were sought to be pleaded.  My
comments are not to be taken as a resiling from the view I take
of the present
pleading, which is that it is hopelessly flawed.		
<P>

140	However, the matters to which Mr Anderson refers may, on careful
reflection, indicate that there is the germ of a case, albeit
not that
presently pleaded.  The possible existence thereof, notwithstanding what I have
said in earlier judgments and in this judgment,
leads me to the conclusion that
the plaintiffs should have another opportunity to plead a viable case.  I do
not think that as such
discrepancies have been pointed up, (and previously the
Court's attention was not directed to these aspects of the report), and an
attempt, albeit unsuccessful to plead them has been made, it is appropriate not
to grant leave to re-plead.  I have come to that
conclusion with considerable
reluctance for the reasons to which I have referred.  But, in the end, I am not
satisfied that it would
be a proper exercise of discretion to prevent the
plaintiffs from pursuing these allegations in a properly structured pleading.
I
should add that I am not to be taken as having formed anything more than a
prima facie view about the possible effects of the matters
to which Mr Anderson
refers or their significance.  There is sufficient for present purposes.
<P>

141	These reasons also make it inappropriate, in my opinion, to entertain
dismissing the proceedings for want of prosecution.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

142	I refuse the plaintiffs leave to rely on the Further Amended Statement of
Claim filed in Court on 19 June 1998.
<P>

	I grant the plaintiffs leave to replead.
<P>

	I order that:-
<P>

(a)	the plaintiffs pay the defendants' costs of the motions I have considered
in this judgment and any reserved costs;
<P>

(b)	the exhibits be returned; and
<P>

(c)	the proceedings stand over to 19 March 1999 for directions.
