<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>

1   	This is an appeal by the Plaintiffs, Allstate Explorations
NL &amp; Others, ("Allstate") from a judgment of Master McLaughlin
of 18 May
1999 brought under Pt 6 r10 of <i>Supreme Court Rules</i> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s118.html" class="autolink_findacts">s118(3)</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</i> 1970</a> (NSW) against the Master's refusal to determine
separate questions to be tried.  It poses questions concerning the proper
approach
to appeals from a Master in matters of discretion and procedure and,
more particularly, the proper approach to the introduction of
extrinsic
evidence in construing contracts involving a fiduciary agent.  The Master
declined to make an order, substantively pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31</a> r2 of the <i>Supreme
Court Rules</i>, that certain questions set forth in the schedule to the
Plaintiffs' Notice of Motion of 3 May 1999 be determined separately from
any
other question or issue in the proceedings and before any final hearing of the
proceedings.  I take the Master's reference to
"substantively" as implicit
recognition of the Court's inherent jurisdiction to embark on a separate
determination of particular
issues, independent of the Rules.  In declining so
to do, the Master exercised the Court's discretion by concluding (para 12):
<P>

"Where, as here, the decision on the questions will not, of necessity, result
in the determination of the proceedings, but will
result in such determination
only if the answers go in one direction, it seems to me that the defendants
should not be deprived of
their right to have the matter heard at a final
hearing of the entirety of the proceedings.  That is especially so where, as
here,
the defendants have raised on the pleadings the assertion that the
plaintiffs are in breach of a fiduciary duty, and especially to
where, as here,
a decision on some, at least, of the questions must depend upon disputed
questions of fact."
<P>

2   	With no objection from the Defendants, the Plaintiffs have,
by Notice of Appeal dated 1 June 1999 re-stated the questions for
separate
determination with some refinements.  They have for the first time, re-stated
the last two questions by reference to six
factual statements in Schedule B.
These the Plaintiffs contend could not be the subject of any bona fide dispute,
and rely inter
alia on an affidavit of John Wood dated 1 June 1999. In relation
to those factual statements, the Appellants rely upon s82 of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme
Court Act</i> 1970</a> (NSW) and seek the Court's exercise of discretion under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s190.html" class="autolink_findacts">s190(3)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</i> 1995</a> (NSW). That discretion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s190.html" class="autolink_findacts">s190(3)</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</i> 1995</a> arises in a civil proceeding where "the matter to
which the evidence relates is not genuinely in dispute", or where otherwise
application
of the relevant provisions "would cause or involve unnecessary
expense or delay". Section 82 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></i> is to similar
effect.  The Defendants, while not objecting to these refinements of the
Plaintiffs' case, take issue with the Plaintiffs'
contentions in their
appeal.
<P>

3   	For convenience, I set out below the relevant schedules
containing the questions sought for separate determination and the
statements
of fact said not to be genuinely in dispute:
<P>

<center><b>SCHEDULE "A" -- QUESTIONS FOR SEPARATE DETERMINATION</b></center>
<P>


<P>

The following questions are for separate determination:
<P>

1.	Whether, as a matter of construction, a 2% Management Fee under clause 2.05
of the Beaconsfield Management Agreement is within
the meaning of `costs' in
clause 11.3 of the Beaconsfield Mine Joint Venture Agreement (the "BMJVA").
<P>

2.	Whether, as a matter of construction, the marking up of an employee's fee
determined on a time basis for each employee of any
company related to the
Manager as are employed on the Project in an amount not exceeding the formula
in Item 17 of the Schedule to
the Beaconsfield Management Agreement is within
the meaning of `costs' in clause 11.3 of the BMJVA.
<P>

3.	Whether, as a matter of construction, a program and budget approval in
accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Part 10</a> which was calculated to include a 2% Management Fee
under clause 2.05 and the marking up of an employee's fee determined on a time
basis for each employee of any company related to the Manager as are employed
on the Project in an amount not exceeding the formula
in Item 17 of the
Schedule to the Beaconsfield Management Agreement is binding upon the joint
venturers and on the Manager under
clause 10.5 of the BMJVA and is a decision
binding upon the Joint Venturers pursuant to clause 7.2 of the BMJVA.
<P>

4.	Whether, in the circumstances as described in schedule B, as a question of
law, the Manager could be subject to any fiduciary
duty as alleged in the
pleadings in carrying out joint venture activities in accordance with programs
and budgets approved by the
Management Committee under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Part 10</a> of the BMJVA.
<P>

5.	Whether, in the circumstances as described in schedule B, as a question of
law, the marking up of an employee's fee determined
on a time basis for each
employee of any company related to the Manager as are employed on the Project,
or engaging retaining or
paying such an employee, in an amount not exceeding
the formula in Item 17 of the Schedule to the BMJVA could be a breach of the
obligation under clause 2.01(c) of the Beaconsfield Management Agreement."
<P>

<center><b>SCHEDULE "B"</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1.	The second and third plaintiffs and the defendants are parties to the
Beaconsfield Mine Joint Venture Agreement ("BMJVA").
<P>

2.	The terms of the BMJVA are set out in Exhibit JCW 1 to the affidavit of John
Charles Wood sworn 9 July 1998 and in annexure A
to the affidavit of John
Charles Wood sworn 1 June 1999.
<P>

3.	Allstate Explorations NL is the Manager of the Beaconsfield Mine Joint
Venture (the "BMJV") and is bound by the terms of the
BMJVA.
<P>

4.	All cash calls made during the period 1 May 1994 to date by the first
plaintiff as Manager of the BMJV were made in accordance
with a programme or
budget approved by the Management Committee.
<P>

5.	The making of the said cash calls by the Manager was done in the course of
carrying out Joint Venture activities.
<P>

6.	A second amended cross-claim has been filed alleging certain fiduciary
duties are owed by the Manager as pleaded, and which are
denied by the
plaintiffs."
<P>

4   	The Master's determination therefore arises as an exercise
of discretion.  Furthermore, it is reached in a matter of practice
and
procedure, where the trial court's determination ordinarily prevails: <i>Do
Carmo v Ford Excavations Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%201%20NSWLR%20409" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 1 NSWLR 409</a> at 420-421.  Moreover,
identification of separate questions is by way of exception to the normal rule
requiring all issues to be
tried together.
<P>

5   	As to overturning such an exercise of discretion, Kirby P
(as he then was) in <i>Golosky v Golosky</i> (NSWCA, 5 October 1993,
unreported) at 13 (approved by the High Court in <i>Singer v Berghouse</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a> at 212) emphasises the need for appellate restraint:
<P>

"Unless appellate courts show restraint in disturbing the evaluative
determinations of primary decision-makers they will inevitably
invite appeals
to a different evaluation which, objectively speaking, may be no better than
the first. Second opinions in such cases
would be bought at the cost of
diminishing the finality of litigation in a troublesome area and, sometimes at
least, with a burden
of costs upon the estate which should not be
encouraged."
<P>

6   	More specifically, Kirby P said in <i>Morrison v Judd</i>
(NSWCA, 10 October 1995, unreported) with whom Meagher and Powel JJA concurred
(at 6):
<P>

"...  It is self-evident that, in appeals of this character within the Supreme
Court, it cannot have been Parliament's intention
that one member of the
Supreme Court (a single Judge) should simply substitute his or her own opinion
<b>on a discretionary decision concerning a matter of practice</b> for that
earlier determined by another member of the Supreme Court (a Master).  If this
were the principal of appellate review, few
cases would conclude at a Master.
Every contested case where the party had "a long pocket" would be taken for
re-determination by
a Judge."
<P>

[emphasis supplied]
<P>

7   	There is thus a substantial onus upon the Appellant in
seeking to overturn such a decision simply because of the nature of
the
decision appealed against.  But in any event, appeal or not, there must be a
high level of confidence that ordering separate
questions satisfies the
stringent requirements for doing so.  These requirements are conveniently set
out by Giles CJ Comm D in <i>Tallglen Pty Ltd v Pay TV Holdings Pty Ltd</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2022%20ACSR%20130" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 22 ACSR 130</a> at 141-2:
<P>

"Part 31 r2 of the rules empowers the court to make orders for the decision of
any question separately from any other question,
whether before, at or after
any trial or further trial in the proceedings, and for the statement of a case
and the question for decision.
<b>In the ordinary course all issues in
proceedings should be decided at the one time</b>, but separate decision of a
question may be appropriate where, for example, the decision of the question is
critical to the outcome
of the proceedings and (at least if decided in one way)
<b>will bring the proceedings to an end</b>.  In particular circumstances the
separate decision of a question may be appropriate even if it will not bring
the proceedings to
an end, such as where there is a strong prospect that the
parties will agree upon the result when the core of their dispute is decided
or
where the decision will obviate unnecessary and expensive hearing of other
questions, but such occasions must be carefully controlled,
lest fragmentation
of the proceedings (particularly when the exercise of rights of appeal is borne
in mind) brings delay, expense
and hardship greater than that which the making
of an order was intended to avoid.  It is often the case that the need to make
findings
of fact for a decision of the separate question, especially findings
which may involve issues of credit, tell strongly against the
making of an
order because related facts, and renewed issues of credit, will or may arise at
a later stage in the proceedings.  <b>Experience teaches that it should be able
to be seen with clarity that decision of a separate question will be beneficial
in the conduct
of the proceedings and the resolution of the parties'
dispute</b>."
<P>

[emphasis supplied]
<P>

<b>BACKGROUND</b>
<P>

8   	These separate questions arise in proceedings concerning an
unincorporated joint venture and its management.  The joint venture
is governed
by an agreement dated 19 October 1992 ("the BMJVA") and by an associated
earlier management agreement dated 4 March 1987
("the management agreement").
The latter governs exploration, and if warranted, development and mining.  The
manager is Allstate
Explorations NL, the First Plaintiff.  The joint venture
includes both the three Defendants and the Second Plaintiff.  The nature
of the
dispute has ramified with the extensive pleadings.  The Plaintiffs contend that
at the core of the dispute are two questions.
 First, whether the Defendants'
notice of 29 June 1998 purporting to be under clause 9.6(c) of the BMJVA
alleging various disputed
breaches by the First Plaintiff, as manager, was
valid.  Second, whether the charges referred to therein constitute a "material
failure"
of the First Plaintiff to perform its obligations and duties under the
joint venture agreement.  The Plaintiffs describe the consequential
issues
raised by the notice as "in essence" whether the appellant manager is entitled
to include:
<P>

(a)	a two per cent management fee in the cash calls on the joint venturers,
and
<P>

(b)	a charge representing a marking up of certain persons' salaries in
accordance with a formula in item 17 to the schedule to the
management
agreement.
<P>

9   	These issues have arisen, following cash calls upon the
joint venturers and in particular the three Defendants.  These calls
are said
to be in accordance with programmes and the budgets approved by a management
committee under the BMJVA.  There is however
an issue of whether the Defendants
were properly aware of what made up their constituent elements, as I describe
later.
<P>

10   	Under the Plaintiffs' Statement of Claim, the First
Plaintiff claims that it is entitled to charge a management fee "under"
clause
2.05 of the relevant Management Agreement (para 15).  To this the Defendants
respond that the definition of "costs" in clause
1.1 of the BMJVA and the costs
the subject of clause 2.1 of the annexed "Accounting Procedure" do not extend
to nor include management
fees (para 17(a)).  They contend, in the alternative,
that management fees are "inconsistent" with the BMJVA (para 17(b)). To this
the Plaintiffs respond that insofar as such management fees were paid by the
Defendants, the Defendants, having had knowledge and
awareness of the
management fees and having approved them in circumstances where the Plaintiffs
have at all times acted pursuant
to decisions of and at the direction of the
management committee, that it follows the Defendants are estopped from denying
that the
First Plaintiff was manager of the joint venture and thus entitled to
the fees.  To this the Plaintiffs respond that any monies paid
were mistakenly
paid by the First Defendant for management fees, with recovery now sought
either by way of restitution or as money
had and received.  I deal later in
more detail with the particularisation of these contentions.
<P>

11   	There is a connection between the issue of the management
fee and what are termed charges for "the services".  Thus the pleadings
disclose a dispute as to whether so much of such charges as represented a sum
based on the marking up formulae in item 17 of the
schedule to the Management
Agreement in respect of the services of personnel retained by the manager on
behalf of the joint venture
are, or are not, the defined term "Costs" within
clause 1.1 of the joint venture. "Costs" are there defined as meaning "all
costs
incurred in connection with Joint Venture Activities, accounted for in
accordance with the Accounting Procedure or, where not provided
for in the
Accounting Procedure, in accordance with generally accepted accounting
practices in Australia". There is a live dispute
as to whether what I shall
call these item 17 service costs "were Costs of the Joint Venture within the
meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p2.1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2.1(f)</a> of the Accounting Procedure" (para 12(a) of the
Defence).
<P>

12   	"Joint Venture Activities" are defined in clause 1 of the
BMJVA as meaning 
<P>

"all activities conducted for the purposes of the Joint Venture and under the
terms of this Agreement, up to the point at which
Production is delivered,
whether actually or notionally, to the Joint Venturers as provided in this
Agreement."
<P>

13   	The connection between the two items, that is the
management fee and the charges based on the marking up formulae is that
both
were included in cash calls issued by the First Plaintiff.  There is thus a
live dispute as to whether the Defendants are, as
the Plaintiffs contend,
"precluded" from disputing that the cash calls issued by the First Plaintiff
prior to 1996, are true and
correct and thus "precluded" from making any
adjustment claims in relation to those cash calls (see para 10 of the
Plaintiffs' Reply).
 That preclusion is said to arise by way of estoppel and on
the basis that the Defendants "had knowledge of, approved and were aware
of the
service cost charges and management fees and that the First Plaintiff has at
all times acted pursuant to decisions of and
at the direction of the Management
Committee" (see Defence of 17 March 1999);  see earlier. 
<P>

14   	A further complex of issues arises by virtue of the Second
Amended Cross-Claim of the Defendants under which, speaking generally,
it is
said that the First Plaintiff stood in a fiduciary relationship with the joint
venturers and owed fiduciary duties to the joint
venturers as there elaborated.
It is then said that the First Plaintiff breached those fiduciary duties by
having:
<P>

"(i)	engaged or retained the services of employees or staff of a related
company in the conduct of the Joint Venture at rates of
up to 2.4 times the
usual salary of those employees and staff;
<P>

(ii)	caused the Joint Venturers to pay for those services amounts of up to 2.4
times the usual salary of those employees and staff
<P>

even though comparable and more cost effective services were otherwise
available."
<P>

15   	The Cross-Claim goes on to contend that monies have been
mistakenly paid by the First Defendant for management fees and for
the marking
up of salaries of personnel so engaged or retained by the first plaintiff (para
36).  Payment back is sought in relation
to those monies either by way of
restitution (para 38) or as money had and received (para 39).
<P>

16   	In the Plaintiffs' reply they rely upon estoppel as
precluding claims under the Cross-Claim and in particular contend (paras
15 and
16): 
<P>

"15.	In further reply, the plaintiffs say that in making cash calls upon, inter
alia, the defendants, the first plaintiff acted
 in accordance with approved
programs and budgets under clause 2.01 of the Beaconsfield Management Agreement
and in accordance with
the control and direction of the Management Committee
under clause 9.3 of the BMJVA and that making the same was part of the joint
venture activities which the Manager was bound to carry out under clause 10.1
of the BMJVA and that the Manager was bound to issue
the cash calls under
clause 11.2 of the BMJVA.
<P>

16.	In further reply, the plaintiffs say that by reason of one or more of the
matters aforesaid there was no failure to perform
any obligation or duty
imposed on the first plaintiff under the BMJVA and in the alternative, no
failure in a material way within
clause 9.6(c), which is otherwise denied."
<P>

17   	There is, as I have said, a live dispute as to the nature
of the approval of the programmes and budgets.  Thus in para 5 of
the
Defendants' Reply to Defence to Second Amended Cross-Claim, paragraphs (b) and
(d) provide relevantly as follows:
<P>

"(b)	admit that their representatives were present at meetings of the
management committee at which proposed programmes and budgets
were discussed
and approved by the management committee.  Save as aforesaid, they deny the
allegations contained in paragraph 7(b);
<P>

(d)	say, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and in further
answer to the whole of paragraph 7, that at no material
time did they
appreciate nor were they informed by the cross-defendants and, in particular,
by the first cross-defendant, for the
purposes of, inter alia, a management
committee meeting or otherwise that:
<P>

(i)	the programmes and budgets referred to in paragraph 7(a) included an amount
or amounts for "Service Costs" and, as implicitly
alleged, an implementation of
the Charge in relation to the Personnel;
<P>

(ii)	the programmes and budgets referred to in paragraph 7(b) included an
amount or amounts for "Service Costs" and, as implicitly
alleged, an
implementation of the Charge in relation to the Personnel;
<P>

(iii)	the cash calls referred to in paragraph 7(c) included an amount or
amounts for "Service Costs" and, as implicitly alleged,
an implementation of
the Charge in relation to the Personnel."
<P>

18   	Earlier in para 4(d) the Defendants contend that they did
not appreciate nor were informed that the proposed programmes and
budgets
prepared and presented at the Management Committee meetings with the joint
venturers included "the charge", this being the
charge in para 6(b) of the
Plaintiffs' Defence to Second Amended Cross-Claim in relation to "the
Personnel" referred to in para 6(a)
thereof.
<P>

19   	Speaking generally, para 6(a) of the Plaintiffs' Defence
to Second Amended Cross-Claim refers to the First Plaintiff as manager
retaining, through a company called Otter Services Pty Limited on behalf of the
joint venturer and allegedly in connection with Joint
Venturer Activities, the
services of some twenty persons. Paragraph 6(b) contends that "the cost of
obtaining the services of those
persons on behalf of the joint venture was in
accordance with the amount charged by Otter Services and was charged in
accordance
with item 17 of the schedule to the Management Agreement ....".  In
that same Defence, the Plaintiffs, in para 7(a) define these
as "Service Costs"
being "amounts in respect of personnel retained through Otter Services Pty
Limited by the First Cross-Defendant,
as Manager of the Joint Venture, on
behalf of the Joint Venture in the programmes and budgets presented to and
approved by the Management
Committee".
<P>

20   	I deal with some of the ramifications of the pleadings
through cross-claims and defences, in order to show that the issues
involved
are of considerable complexity.  Speaking very broadly, they stem from the
notice pleaded in paras 19 and 20 of the Plaintiffs'
Statement of the Claim,
said to be pursuant to clauses 12.5 and 9.6(c) of the BMJVA, requiring the
First Plaintiff, as manager, to
rectify specified alleged breaches of the
BMJVA, such breaches being as I have earlier described and as elaborated in
para 20 set
out below:
<P>

"Specific details of the alleged defaults of the first plaintiff as Manager in
allegedly not conforming to the BMJVA when issuing
cash calls under clause 11.3
of the BMJVA, all of which are denied, are:
<P>

(a)	charging incorrectly (charging 2.4 times salary rather than fair cost
recovery) for the services of the Manager-Metallurgy (Barrie
Hancock) who is a
site employee;
<P>

(b)	charging incorrectly (charging 2.4 times salary rather than fair cost
recovery) for the services of offsite personnel (such
as Patrick Scott and Ian
Kirkham) employed by Otter Gold Mines Limited or other companies within the
Otter Gold Group; and
<P>

(c)	charging a management fee (calculated as 2% of total Joint Venture
expenditure except for HEC power costs) when such a fee is
not a defined Cost
under the BMJVA."
<P>

21   	The Plaintiffs conclude by seeking the following
declarations:
<P>

"1.	A declaration that the facsimile dated 29 June 1998 from the first
defendant to the plaintiffs is not a valid notice issued
pursuant to clause
9.6(c) of the BMJVA and is of no effect.
<P>

2.	A declaration that the purported notice is not a valid notice issued
pursuant to clause 12.5 of the BMJVA and is of  no effect.
<P>

3.	A declaration that each of the cash calls issued by the first plaintiff as
Manager of the Beaconsfield Mine Joint Venture have
been properly made within
clause 11.3 of the BMJVA in respect of the charges referred to in the purported
notice, being:
<P>

(a)	the services of the Mine Manager -- Metallurgy, Mr Barrie Hancock;
<P>

(b)	offsite personnel;  and
<P>

(c)	a management fee.
<P>

4.	Further and in the alternative, a declaration that any charge referred to in
the purported notice not properly made within clause
11.3 of the BMJVA is not
in all the circumstances a failure in a material way to perform any obligation
or duty under the BMJVA by
the first plaintiff as Manager of the Beaconsfield
Mine."
<P>

22   	The Plaintiffs in their outline submissions of 1 June 1999
gave a summation of the background to the issues now raised in
para 2-5 in
these terms:  
<P>

"2.	The respondents served a purported notice dated 29 June 1998 upon the first
appellant allegedly under clause 9.6(c) of the BMJVA.
 The issues raised by
this purported notice are in essence whether the appellant is entitled to
include a 2% management fee in the
cash calls and whether the Manager is
entitled to include a charge representing a marking up of certain persons'
salaries in accordance
with a formula in Item 17 to the schedule to the
Beaconsfield Management Agreement.
<P>

3.	The appellants commenced proceedings seeking declaratory relief specifically
focussing upon the construction issues raised by
the purported notice.  A
Defence and Second Amended Cross-Claim have been filed by the respondents which
raises construction issues
as well as an allegation of alleged fiduciary duty
relating to the marking up of the employees' salaries as well as seeking
recovery
based on restitution for moneys had and received for the amounts paid
in relation to the management fee and for so much of the salary
as is above the
fair cost of recovery for the services.  A defence has been filed to the Second
Cross-Claim raising both the matters
of construction as well as joining issue
with the causes of action alleged in the cross-claim as well as pleading
certain estoppels.
 A reply has also been filed by the appellants raising both
matters of construction and estoppel as well as a reply by the respondents.
<P>

4.	The parties had an interlocutory dispute on the pleadings in relation to the
adequacy of the alleged fiduciary duty.
<P>

4.	By Notice of Motion dated 3 May 1999, which came before Master McLaughlin
for hearing on 18 May 1999, the appellants sought to
have separately determined
three questions of construction and two questions of law.  The application was
supported by an affidavit
of G. L. Kent sworn 12 May 1999 together with certain
paragraphs of an affidavit of J. C. Wood sworn 9 July 1998 which was not the
subject of cross-examination or competing evidence."
<P>

23   	It is important to appreciate that the Plaintiffs in their
broad overview could not adequately portray the factual and legal
complexities
exhibited by the pleadings to which I have made reference.  Furthermore, these
pleadings are themselves the subject
of a request for further and better
particulars by the Defendants from the Plaintiffs in relation to the
Plaintiffs' Reply dated
17 March 1999 and the Defence to Second Amended
Cross-Claim dated 17 March 1999.  While the Plaintiffs point to the application
being
supported by an affidavit of G L Kent dated 12 May 1999 and certain
paragraphs of an affidavit of J C Wood dated 9 July 1998 pointing
out that
these were not the subject of cross-examination or competing evidence (see para
5 of the Plaintiff's outline of submissions
of 1 June 1999), it cannot be
assumed that the request for particulars will not lead to the need for further
evidence, or cross-examination.
I should add that the Plaintiffs, to overcome
any dispute in relation to the facts contained in Schedule B, have served a
Notice
of Motion supported by an affidavit of Mr Wood sworn 1 June 1999.  But
even if the facts in schedule B were treated as essentially
not in dispute,
there are real difficulties, of which the Master was evidently conscious, in
seizing upon these preliminary questions
as being straightforward questions of
construction or law capable of resolution solely by reference to those facts
and likely to
be decisive of the proceedings if decided in a particular way.
Before dealing with those difficulties in detail, I will elaborate
on the
applicable legal principles, to which I have earlier made reference at para 7
above.
<P>

<b>LEGAL PRINCIPLES</b>
<P>

24   	An obvious danger with quarantining what are claimed to be
the only relevant facts is that others may later turn out to be
relevant.  Then
the court is in danger of impermissibly exceeding its proper judicial function,
by deciding hypothetical rather than
real questions in reliance on incomplete
facts or facts not all found or agreed; see the joint judgments of the High
Court in <i>Bass and Another v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd &amp; Ors</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] HCA 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20161%20ALR%20399" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999)
161 ALR 399</a> at 413-8 precluding such a course.  The High Court cited with
approval Brooking J in <i>Jacobson v Ross</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1995/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] VicRp 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%201%20VR%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 VR 337</a> at 341:
<P>

"Care must be taken to ensure that, in one way or another, all the facts that
are on any fairly arguable view relevant to the determination
of the question
are ascertainable ... as facts assumed to be correct for the purposes of the
preliminary determination, or as facts
which both sides accept as correct, or
as facts which are to be judicially determined.  Failure to do this, and in
particular failure
to perceive that the facts alleged in a pleading are some
only of the facts relevant to the determination of the preliminary question,
may make the order for preliminary determination unfruitful."
<P>

25   	That requirement is a fundamental barrier in the way of
ordering separate questions which are not determinable solely by facts
found or
agreed.
<P>

26   	Lord Denning in <i>Carl Zeiss Stiftung v Herbert Smith
&amp; Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%20CA%2093" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1968] CA 93</a> at 98-9 confirmed that the proper rule is that a
preliminary issue does not have to be decisive whichever way it is decided.  It
is enough if it is going to be decisive of the litigation if decided <i>in one
way</i>; see also Needham J in <i>Printing &amp; Kindred Industries Union of
Australia v Clarke</i> (Needham J, SCNSW, 17 September 1976, unreported).  He
adds an important warning that mixed questions of fact and law rarely allow
of
a separate question:
<P>

"I quite agree that in many cases the facts and law are so mixed up that it is
very undesirable to have a preliminary issue.  I
always like to know the facts
before deciding the law."
<P>

27   	Thus what a contract means is primarily a question of law
to be found as a matter of objective intention of the parties derived
in the
first instance from the words used.  But courts have long recognised that
disputes about what meaning was objectively intended
almost invariably requires
recourse to the factual matrix of the contract.  What is comprised in the
factual matrix, its potential
for expansion in the interpretive process, is
still a matter of divergent view.  A narrow formulation was recently essayed by
the
Court of Appeal in these terms:  "the immediate context of the contract,
facts which both parties would have had in mind and known
that the other had in
mind when the contract was made";  per Staughton LJ in <i>Scottish Power plc v
Britoil (Exploration) Ltd &amp; others</i> (CA (Staughton, Ottow and Robert
Walker LJJ), 18 November 1997) Times Law Reports 2 December 1997.  Whether any
wider ambit of fact
may also be considered under factual matrix, or context, is
discussed later (paras 39 and following).  But this does not affect the
basic
proposition that a dispute about the construction of a contract, though
primarily a legal question, almost invariably involves
factual questions of
context as well.
<P>

28   	It is important that if limited issues are proposed for
separate determination, the utmost care must be taken to ensure that
they are
really suitable for separate decision and that the questions are specified with
clarity, in particular with respect to mixed
questions of fact and law; see
<i>American Home Assurance Co v Ampol Refineries Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2010%20NSWLR%2013" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 10 NSWLR 13</a> at
18.
<P>

29   	Thus courts often refuse to make such orders where what
may first appear to be a pure question of law involves in truth findings
of
fact and the drawings of inferences from primary facts that are more properly
dealt with as part of the proceedings as a whole;
<i>Rogers v Bailieu Bullock
Wilkinson Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%2028%20SASR%20594" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 28 SASR 594.</a>
<P>

30   	That is not to say that, especially in complex litigation,
there may not be circumstances where separate questions will be
beneficial in
the conduct of the proceedings and represent a likely shortening of the
proceedings;  the paradigm case is where a
decision of a particular question
critical to the outcome of the proceedings will, at least if decided in one
way, bring the proceedings
to an earlier end. The question is whether the
Plaintiffs satisfy the onus upon them to disturb the finding of the Master that
those
exceptional circumstances were not there made out. It is to that I now
turn.
<P>

<b>RESOLUTION OF THIS APPEAL BY REFERENCE TO THOSE PRINCIPLES</b>
<P>

31   	It is convenient to take each of the questions in turn,
referring where necessary to the relevant provisions of the joint
venture
documentation.  
<P>

32   	Question 1:  
<P>

Whether, as a matter of construction, a 2% Management Fee under clause 2.05 of
the Beaconsfield Management Agreement is within the
meaning of `costs' in
clause 11.3 of the Beaconsfield Mine Joint Venture Agreement (the "BMJVA")?
<P>

33   	In relation to this question, the Defendants concede that
on its face, it is arguable that question 1 is liable to be answered
without
resort to a factual framework. However, they contend that any answer would be
unhelpful and that there are plainly anterior
issues of some complexity to be
untangled which do require resort to a factual framework before the kind of
matters identified in
question 1 can usefully be answered.
<P>

34   	Thus the Defendants rely upon paras 17(b) and 18 of the
Defendant and Second Amended Cross-Claim which is in these terms:
<P>

"17.	Further, the Defendants say, inter alia:
<P>

(a)	the definition of "Costs" in clause 1.1 of the BMJVA and the costs the
subject of clause 2.1 of the Accounting Procedure (as
defined in paragraph 12
of the Statement of Claim) do not extend to nor include management fees;
<P>

(b)	to the extent that a management fee is anticipated by the Management
Agreement (as defined in paragraph 13 of the Statement
of Claim) such a fee:
<P>

(i)	is not a relevant "principle" for the purposes of clause 9.3 of the BMJVA;
further or alternatively
<P>

(ii)	is inconsistent with the substantive provisions of the BMJVA and, the
BMJVA, by reason of clause 9.3 thereof, prevails over
the Management
Agreement.
<P>

18.	(a)	Subject to referring to the full terms and effect of the BMJVA at the
trial of the proceeding and, specifically, clause
9.3 of the BMJVA, they admit
that all Joint Venture Activities (as defined in clause 1.1 of the BMJVA) were
to be carried out by
the first Plaintiff in accordance with the principles set
out in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 2</a> of the Management Agreement.
<P>

(b)	Save as aforesaid they deny each and every allegation contained in
paragraph 16."
<P>

35   	The Defendants' difficulty in a substantive trial of this
question lies in the express words of clause 2.05 of the Beaconsfield
Management Agreement.  It clearly enough contemplates a two per cent management
fee whilst clause 11.3 of the BMJVA is in these terms:

<P>

"The Manager at its discretion, not more than thirty days before the
commencement of any month, may issue to each Joint Venturer
a Cash Call for
that Joint Venturer's Percentage Interest share of the estimated Cost which the
Manager anticipates will be incurred
during that month."
<P>

36   	"Costs" are defined as meaning 
<P>

"all costs incurred in connection with Joint Venture Activities, accounted for
in accordance with the Accounting Procedure or, where
not provided for in the
Accounting Procedure, in accordance with generally accepted accounting
practices in Australia."
<P>

37   	The essence of the Defendants' argument is that each of
these provisions must be subject to the overriding effect of clause
9.3 of the
BMJVA, which provides: 
<P>

"All Joint Venture Activities must be carried out by the Manager, subject to
the control and direction of the Committee and in accordance
with the
principles set out in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">s2</a> of the Management Agreement."
<P>

38   	The pleading, as I have earlier quoted it, then asserts
that "Costs" as so defined and as referred to in Clause 2.1 of the
Accounting
Procedure is a term not apt to comprehend management fees and in particular the
two percent Management Fee.  Further that
to the extent that such a Management
Fee is anticipated by the Management Agreement, as clearly it is, it is not "a
relevant `principle'"
for the purposes of the overriding clause 9.3 of the
BMJVA or is actually inconsistent with it. Presumably this latter argument
depends
on the word "principles" being inapt to pick up something of the nature
of a management fee.
<P>

39   	It can be seen that the argument is not without its
difficulties. Nonetheless, insofar as the argument is not so implausible
as to
lead to a successful strike-out application in relation to that part of the
Defendants' pleadings, as I am satisfied is the
case, it does give rise to a
legitimate question of interpretation anterior to question 1. The Defendants'
argument is then that
one cannot resolve that prior question without the Court
looking at the relevant background before the parties in ascertaining
objectively
their contractual intentions.  At the narrower level this means
looking at least at what may be said to be the immediate context
of the
contract;  that is, confining the factual matrix to the facts which both
parties would have had in mind and known the other
had in mind when the
contract was made; per Staughton LJ in <i>Scottish Power plc v Britoil
(Exploration) and Others</i> (supra).  Lord Hoffman in <i>Mannai Investment Co
Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] UKHL 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%202%20WLR%20945" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 2 WLR 945</a> at 972 would go
further (speaking obiter in describing how contracts are to be construed, for
what was before him was a contractual
notice, not the contract itself): 
<P>

"In the case of commercial contracts, the restriction on the use of background
has been quietly dropped. There are certain special
kinds of evidence, such as
previous negotiations and express declarations of intent, which for practical
reasons .... are inadmissible
in aid of construction. ... but apart from these
exceptions, commercial contracts are construed in the light of all the
background
which could reasonably have been expected to have been available to
the parties in order to ascertain what would objectively have
been understood
to be their intentions: <i>Prenn v Simmonds</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%201%20WLR%201381" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 1 WLR 1381</a>, 1383. The
fact that the words are capable of a literal application is no obstacle to
evidence which demonstrates what a reasonable
person with knowledge of the
background would have understood the parties to mean, even if this compels one
to say that they used
the wrong words. In this area, we no longer confuse the
meaning of words with the question of what meaning the use of the words was
intended to convey."
<P>

40   	That approach has not escaped academic criticism.  Thus
Sir Christopher Staughton, the judge in <i>Scottish Power</i> writing
extra-judicially in  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1999%2058%20Cambridge%20Law%20Journal%20303" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1999 58 Camb LJ 303</a> at 307 and 309 expresses concern at the
proliferation of such extrinsic material  with attendant cost; also at the
notion that courts
may ever override the plain words which the parties have
used.  But it may be questioned whether words are necessarily as plain as
they
first seem.  As Spigelman CJ, remarks (Sir Ninian Stephen Lecture delivered 23
March 1999) writing extra-judicially:  "Those
who would strictly apply a `plain
meaning' rule have to recognise that general words do not necessarily have a
plain meaning", citing
Lord Wilberforce in <i>Maunsell v Olins</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20AC%20373" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] AC
373</a> at 385-6
<P>

41   	Lord Hoffman seeks to emancipate legal construction from
the notion that one must <i>first</i> find patent ambiguity before extrinsic
evidence becomes admissible.  It is rather the extrinsic evidence that not
infrequently first
shows that the literal meaning was not, in an objective
sense, what both parties intended; ambiguity in that sense is latent rather
than patent.  Semanticists teach us that ambiguity resides in almost any
writing divorced from context. Lord Hoffman, writing extra-judicially
on "The
Intolerable Wrestle with Words and Meanings" in  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20114%20South%20African%20Law%20Journal%20656" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 114 SALJ 656</a> at 658 had
this to say:
<P>

"I am not sure that it would ever be possible to use words in a way which was
completely unambiguous regardless of the context in
which they were uttered; it
would certainly require a great deal of thought which we do not normally give
to speaking or even writing.
 In practice we do not try."
<P>

42   	Indeed "ambiguity" is itself a word of ambiguous
reference.  Does it mean that one of two (or more) meanings are <i>equally</i>
available, or does it also comprehend the commoner situation where the literal
words have a likely conventional meaning but are capable
of bearing a less
likely one;  one which, under well-accepted canons of construction can be
established as the parties' common intention
in an objective sense, by
reference to what Lord Steyn calls "the objective contextual scene".
<P>

43   	Thus in <i>Mannai</i> Lord Steyn at 961 said:
<P>

"First, in respect of contracts .... the contextual scene is always relevant.
Secondly, what is <i>admissible</i> as a matter of the rules of evidence under
this heading is what is arguably relevant. But admissibility is not the
decisive matter.
The real question is what evidence of surrounding
circumstances might ultimately be allowed to influence the question of
interpretation.
That depends on what meanings the language read against the
objective contextual scene will let in. Thirdly the inquiry is objective:
the
question is what reasonable persons, circumstanced as the actual parties were,
would have had in mind."
<P>

44   	But whether one takes the wider or narrow view of context
and factual matrix, the questions of construction are not self-evidently
ones
which can be safely determined solely by reference to the words used and the
factual matters in Schedule B, with no resort beyond
that to "the objective
contextual scene". 
<P>

45   	Thus when one analyses Question 1 in terms of the
pleadings, it does evoke anterior questions indicating the <i>possibility</i>
-- yet to be determined -- of a different outcome than a surface reading of the
literal words may suggest; in particular as to whether,
though the two per cent
Management Fee (upper or lower case) may be literally within the meaning of
"Costs" in clause 11.3 of the
BMJVA, this result may nonetheless be precluded
by other provisions of the BMJVA and the associated documents.  This is judged
by
reference to the objective contextual scene, viewed by "reasonable persons
circumstanced as the actual parties were", so as to determine
in an objective
sense what such persons would have had in mind in relation to the Management
Fee.  In so doing, one seeks to find
the meaning to be attributed objectively
to the words from the evident commercial purpose of the parties' overall
arrangements; 
compare Lord Steyn "Contract Law: Expectations of Honest Men"
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20113%20Law%20Quarterly%20Review%20431" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 113 LQR 431</a> at 441.
<P>

46   	On that basis, there are questions of fact to be
determined which go beyond those factual statements contained in Schedule
B,
even if all of these were treated as not genuinely in dispute and thus treated
as matters which the Defendants should be required
to admit without further
proof.
<P>

47   	That reasoning must be fatal to determining question 1 as
a proper question for separate determination, as it cannot be said
that it
could not depend on facts additional to those required to be admitted, when
regard is had to anterior issues.
<P>

48   	Question 2:  
<P>

Whether, as a matter of construction, the marking up of an employee's fee
determined on a time basis for each employee of any company
related to the
Manager as are employed on the Project in an amount not exceeding the formula
in Item 17 of the Schedule to the Beaconsfield
Management Agreement is within
the meaning of `costs' in clause 11.3 of the BMJVA.?
<P>

49   	Here again, the Defendants' apparent concession that the
question is susceptible on its face to determination without resort
to
extrinsic facts is importantly qualified. The Defendants contend that such an
approach is inattentive to antecedent questions
that must be resolved which
themselves present issues, the answers to which will require evidence
concerning the conduct of the Plaintiffs.
<P>

50   	The Defendants' contentions are as I have earlier quoted
them from the Defendants' pleadings. Essentially, what the Defendants
put in
issue is the Plaintiffs' contention that the Defendants "had knowledge" and
were "aware" that the multiplier (140 per cent
concededly within the formula in
item 17 of the schedule to the Beaconsfield Management Agreement), had been
applied in relation
to the twenty persons set out para 6(a) of the Plaintiffs'
Defence.  That is put in issue by para 5(d) and 6(j) of the Defendants'
Reply
to Defence to the Second Amended Cross-Claim. The Defendants point to the 29
June 1998 notice (Annexure A to the 9 July 1999
Wood affidavit) and to the
particulars of para 32 of the Defendant's Defence and Second Amended
Cross-Claim as referring only to
three persons, Messrs Hancock, Scott and
Kirkham as having received that mark-up, whereas seventeen additional persons
who received
the mark-up were identified in para 6(a) of the Plaintiffs'
Defence to Second Amended Cross-Claim.
<P>

51   	Essentially, the Defendants' contention is that, being (as
they say) unaware and lacking knowledge of this multiplier in relation
to the
twenty persons, this removes the basis for a "Cash Call" capable of being
legitimately made by the Plaintiffs.  Such a Cash
Call must be the result of an
approved and binding programme and budget for the purposes of clause 10.5 of
the BMJVA.  The Committee,
under clause 10.3 of the BMJVA must meet to consider
and approve programmes and budgets prepared by the Manager before there can
be
a Cash Call for it is only "a programme and budget approved in accordance with
the above provisions of that Part" which will be
binding upon the joint
ventures and on the Manager; see clause 10.5 of the BMJVA.  The Defendants
claim ignorance of a constituent
element of the Cash Call, as put in issue by
paras 5(d) and 6(j) of the Defendants' earlier mentioned Reply.
<P>

52   	Essentially then the argument will be a factual one as to
whether there was knowledge and awareness of the relevant marking-up
on the
part of the Defendants via their representation on the relevant Committee. If
there were lacking that knowledge and awareness,
then question 2, even if
answered in the affirmative, would not in that regard resolve the real dispute
between the parties. That
dispute is not the question of construction but
rather the question of whether as the Plaintiffs allege, there are necessary
anterior
procedures of full disclosure to be complied with and whether they
were, such as would allow a Cash Call to be made which included
the relevant
mark-ups.
<P>

53   	That again is fatal to allowing question 2 as a question
for separate determination as it cannot in any real sense shorten
the
proceedings even if resolved in favour of the Plaintiffs. I should add that
while the relevant affidavit evidence indicates some
disclosure (see Annexure A
to the 9 July 1998 Wood affidavit plus paras 27 and 29) the Defendants' case as
I understand it is that
they were not aware with particularity of the numbers
of personnel receiving this mark-up and that this was a material matter. One
can anticipate the Plaintiffs will strongly contend that the disclosure was
sufficient but that is the very kind of matter that is
properly for the
substantive trial.
<P>

54   	Question 3:
<P>

Whether, as a matter of construction, a program and budget approval in
accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Part 10</a> which was calculated to include a 2% Management Fee
under clause 2.05 and the marking up of an employee's fee determined on a time
basis for each employee of any company related to the Manager as are employed
on the Project in an amount not exceeding the formula
in Item 17 of the
Schedule to the Beaconsfield Management Agreement is binding upon the joint
venturers and on the Manager under
clause 10.5 of the BMJVA and is a decision
binding upon the Joint Venturers pursuant to clause 7.2 of the BMJVA.?
<P>

55   	For the same reason as question 2 should not be for
separate determination, question 3 should not be allowed either. Question
3
simply begs the question as to whether the programme and budget had been
approved in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Part 10</a> of the BMJVA so as to have the consequences
in clause 7.2 and 10.5 of the BMJVA.
<P>

56   	Question 4:
<P>

Whether, in the circumstances as described in schedule B, as a question of law,
the Manager could be subject to any fiduciary duty
as alleged in the pleadings
in carrying out joint venture activities in accordance with programs and
budgets approved by the Management
Committee under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Part 10</a> of the BMJVA.?
<P>

57   	This question of whether the Manager could be subject to
any fiduciary duty as alleged in the pleadings "in carrying out joint
venture
activities in accordance with programmes and budgets approved by the Management
Committee under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Part 10</a> of the BMJVA" first suffers from the difficulty earlier
mentioned, namely that it begs the question whether or not the programmes
and
budgets were relevantly here approved by the Management Committee.  This is in
terms not just of their global total but of a
sufficiently explicit breakdown
of the items therein comprised including the mark-up for the twenty employees.
The underlying premise
of the Plaintiffs is that once a programme and budget is
approved by the Management Committee under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Part 10</a> of the BMJVA, the Manager
must simply carry out the joint venture activities in accordance with those
programmes and budgets so approved
such that the fiduciary duty is overridden
by that contractual stipulation. The Plaintiffs rely on the well-known passage
in <i>Hospital Products Limited v United States Surgical Corporation &amp;
Others</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 64</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20156%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 156 CLR 41</a> at 97 where Mason J says:
<P>

"That contractual and fiduciary relationships may co-exist between the same
parties has never been doubted.  Indeed, the existence
of a basic contractual
relationship has in many situations provided a foundation for the erection of a
fiduciary relationship.  In
these situations, it is the contractual foundation
which is all important because it is the contract that regulates the basic
rights
and liabilities of the parties.  The fiduciary relationship, if it is to
exist at all, must accommodate itself to the terms of the
contract so that it
is consistent with, and conforms to them.  The fiduciary relationship cannot be
superimposed upon the contract
in such a way as to alter the operation which
the contract was intended to have according to its true construction."
<P>

58   	To this the Defendants have several answers based on the
contract itself and also that a fiduciary relationship on the manager's
part
would find its foundation in agency, not contract, in contrast to the situation
in <i>Hospital Products</i>.  First, they point to clause 2.01(c) of the
Management Agreement which requires the performance of joint venture activities
"in
a good and workmanlike and cost effective manner". Certainly, one would
expect that a fiduciary obligation which would apply to the
Manager as agent of
the venturers would go so far as to place the Manager under a fiduciary
obligation in preparation of the relevant
programmes and budgets which are
themselves to be approved; see generally for a useful discussion on an operator
or manager's fiduciary
position, "Joint Ventures Law in Australia", edited by W
D Duncan 1994 and in particular "Joint Ventures and Equity -- Fiduciary
Aspects" by Rogers and Nesbitt at 77-9.  A manager or operator is the paradigm
of a fiduciary agent, being the agent of the venturers,
whether appointed by
them jointly or severally.
<P>

59   	It is significant that in the case of a manager or
operator, the existence of the basic contractual relationship may not,
in the
earlier quoted words of Mason J, necessarily provide "the foundation for" the
erection of the fiduciary relationship.  Rather
that foundation is to be
derived not from contract, but from the fact that the Manager is the agent of
the venturers.  Fiduciary
obligations presumptively attach as a matter of law
to an agency relationship, more particularly where the operator is placed in
the position of ascendancy or trust and confidence by the venturers in holding
funds and property for them.  The contract may flesh
out the details of those
fiduciary obligations, but is not their fundamental source.
<P>

60   	That does not render the joint venture contractual
documentation irrelevant to the content of the fiduciary obligation.  But
it
does not equate the situation to that of, for example, a distributor to his
principal, where the relationship <i>per se</i>, unlike an agency, does not
have a fiduciary character but depends fundamentally on the contract itself
though capable of being affected
by other factors.  Here, the contractual
documentation would have to be looked at with some care in analysing the
content of the
fiduciary duty of the Manager in the relevant circumstances but
is not determinative in that fundamental sense.  Answering question
4 as a
separate question would not therefore assist in that overall determination. I
should add that such a determination again necessarily
requires reference to
the factual matrix of the parties' relationship and the factual matters set out
in B are quite possibly incomplete
for this purpose.  Moreover the question is
one of mixed fact and law where separating questions and identifying all
relevant facts
with the necessary precision presents especial difficulty.
<P>

61   	Question 5:
<P>

Whether, in the circumstances as described in schedule B, as a question of law,
the marking up of an employee's fee determined on
a time basis for each
employee of any company related to the Manager as are employed on the Project,
or engaging retaining or paying
such an employee, in an amount not exceeding
the formula in Item 17 of the Schedule to the BMJVA could be a breach of the
obligation
under clause 2.01(c) of the Beaconsfield Management Agreement?
<P>

62   	Question 5 is in my opinion in a similar position so far
as it being a mixed question of fact and law. The marking-up of an
employee's
fee is not automatically to be treated as complying with the relevant
provisions of the joint venture documentation and
in particular clause 2.01(c),
merely because it did not exceed the formula in item 17 of the schedule to the
BMJVA.
<P>

63   	Indeed when one considers the multiplicity of
circumstances that may apply in particular cases to the justifiability of
marking-up
of an employee's fee, tested against clause 2.1(c) requiring the
Manager subject as there stated, "to perform all of its obligations
hereunder
and conduct all Operations in a good and workmanlike and <i>cost effective</i>
manner, "the answer may well be "it all depends". That is another way of saying
that answering question 5 as an abstract question
of law, without reference to
facts other than those described in Schedule B, could not be determinative. If
one takes, for example,
para 4 of Schedule B, if there were insufficient
disclosure in the relevant programme or budget prepared by the Manager by way
of
breakdown, there could, depending on the circumstances, be a basis for
concluding that a breach of the obligation under clause 2.01(c)
of the
Beaconsfield Management Agreement had occurred.  This matter of course has not
been tested. But it highlights the difficulty
of separating out a question such
as question 5.
<P>

64   	Thus for similar reasons question 5 is not a question
which should be separately answered.
<P>

<b><i>Conclusion</i></b>
<P>

65   	I do not find anything in the grounds of appeal which
should alter the conclusion that I have earlier reached that none of
the five
questions should be separately answered.  I find no fault with the Master's
reasoning, though I have attempted to elaborate
what should be its underpinning
in the context of the particular questions sought to be separately answered.
The Master had adequate
grounds for not being assured that these questions were
capable of easy separation from disputed questions of fact or were yet ripe
for
determination. Nor were they questions which would assuredly, if answered one
way, shorten the case; indeed I would be inclined
to think they may well
lengthen it, if unintendedly.
<P>

<b>Factual Admissions Sought -- Schedule B</b>
<P>

66   	I turn now to the admissions sought in Schedule B.
Paragraphs 1 and 2 are not genuinely in dispute and indeed the Defendants
do
not contend otherwise, though they fairly require so far as paragraph 2 is
concerned, that the Plaintiffs produce the BMJVA and
the Amendment Deed rather
than rely on Exhibit JCW1 which contains some scribbled annotations.
<P>

67   	As to paragraph 3, a statement that Allstate Explorations
NL is the Manager of the Beaconsfield Mine Joint Venture (see "BMJV")
and is
bound by the terms of the BMJVA" is correctly described as ambiguous, in that
it is unclear whether this is a statement of
present fact or a statement as to
a position over a given period and if the latter, what that period is. However,
it should not be
difficult to re-frame paragraph 4 to remedy any ambiguity on
that score.
<P>

68   	As to paragraph 4 regarding Cash Calls, this again begs
the question were the relevant items properly disclosed in the programme
or
budget by way of separate itemisation.
<P>

69   	As to paragraph 5, this must be a question of both fact
and law and is not something that could be said to be outside the
realm of
genuine dispute.
<P>

70   	As to paragraph 6, its raison d'&ecirc;tre was presumably
to serve as a shorthand description of the pleadings, for the purpose
of
answering the questions sought to be separately determined and in particular
question 4. I agree with the Defendants' position
that it would be better to
avoid paraphrasing the pleadings.
<P>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>

71   	None of the five questions sought to be separately
determined should be separately determined and the Master's conclusion
in that
regard should not be disturbed. As to the admission as not genuinely in dispute
of items 1 and 2 of Schedule B, that should
be required and likewise paragraph
3 of Schedule B, subject to appropriate definition of the term or period to
which it relates.
 No other matters need be admitted.
<P>

72   	Costs should ordinarily follow the event though if the
parties wish to do so I will hear argument on costs.
