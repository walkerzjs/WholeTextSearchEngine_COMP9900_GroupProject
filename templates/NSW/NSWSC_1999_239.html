TUESDAY, 16 MARCH 1999
<P>

<b>3367/97	JOHN ALEXANDER BROGAN &amp; ORS v NEW SOUTH WALES CRIME COMMISSION
&amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	These proceedings are brought by the plaintiffs against the defendant seeking
declaratory relief relating to the powers of the
first defendant, the New South
Wales Crime Commission, and consequential declarations of invalidity of search
warrants issued by
Justices of the Peace.  This is an application under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 54</a> that the proceedings be transferred to the Common
Law Division or the Administrative Law Division of this Court.  Normally
proceedings
of this sort would be brought in one or other of those Divisions to
be dealt with by the Judges of the Court who usually exercise
its jurisdiction
relating to the criminal law.  There is some debate as to whether the
Administrative Law Division or the Common
Law Division would be more
appropriate.  The proceedings relating to the New South Wales Crime Commission
fall squarely within the
class of proceedings assigned to the Administrative
Law Division by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53(3B)(b)(iii)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a> but, insofar as
they relate to the actions of the Justices of the Peace, the definitions
contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53(3C)</a> appear to exclude proceedings from the purview of
proceedings assigned to the that Division.  Any proceedings, of course, can be
heard in any Division, subject to the power of the Court to transfer them.  
<P>

2	However, I need not make the choice in this case between the Administrative
Law Division and the Common Law Division, because
the defendants draw my
attention to the fact that the relevant search warrants were issued and
executed as long ago as October 1996
and these proceedings have been pending
since 28 July 1997.  It was only on 10 March 1999, when these proceedings were
in the Registrar's
callover list, to be fixed for hearing in the normal course
of the business of the General List in this Division that the plaintiff
filed
the motion for transfer.  Mr Buscombe, of counsel for the plaintiffs, asks me
not to make the transfer because the matter is
about to be assigned a trial
date in this Division and his clients have fears of the matter returning to the
bottom of the General
List in the Common Law Division.  Whilst that may, or may
not, be what would occur, I can have no assurance, and the plaintiffs can
have
no assurance, as to what course the proceedings would follow in the Common Law
Division.  It would be unfair if the plaintiffs
lost an opportunity for an
early trial by the transfer of the matter.  I can ensure that they have an
early trial by retaining the
matter in this Division and, in all the
circumstances of the case, I think that is the proper course.  I propose to
dismiss the motion.
<P>

3	Whilst it is understandable, in a sense, that the motion has been brought,
even at this late date, because in the normal order
this matter would be dealt
with in the Common Law Division or the Administrative Law Division, I do not
think that there should be
departure from the ordinary rule that the
defendants, as the unsuccessful applicants in the motion, should pay the
plaintiffs' costs
of the motion.  I add that, when I speak of the defendants, I
refer to the first and fourth defendants, the New South Wales Crime
Commission
and the State of New South Wales, which are the active defendants in the
proceedings.  I do not refer to the second and
third defendants, who are the
relevant Justices of the Peace, and who have filed submitting appearances.
<P>

4	The orders of the Court will be as follows:
<P>

1	The first and fourth defendants' notice of motion filed 10 March 1999 is
dismissed.
<P>

2	I order the first and fourth defendants to pay the plaintiffs' costs of the
motion.
