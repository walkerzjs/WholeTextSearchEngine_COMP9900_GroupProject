<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  The plaintiff by notice of motion filed 6
December 1995 seeks an extension of time within which to commence proceedings
pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 60G</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">60I</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a> </b>1969 (NSW) (the Act).
The plaintiff relied on his affidavit sworn 22 March 1999.  The defendant did
not rely on any affidavit evidence
but opposed the orders sought.
<P>

2  	The plaintiff was cross examined and he gave truthful evidence.
For the purposes of this application I find the facts as follows.
 In doing so,
I have taken the plaintiff's case at its highest.  Should the matter go to
trial some of these facts will be disputed.
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff was born on 2 July 1933.  He now resides in Western
Australia.
<P>

(2)	On 10 April 1952 shortly before the plaintiff's 19th birthday he became a
member of the Royal Australian Navy and enlisted for
an initial period of 6
years to 9 April 1958.  He was re-engaged on 8 May 1962 for a further period of
6 years.  He was discharged
from the Navy on 6 May 1968 with the rank of Petty
Officer Cook. He was in good health both physically and psychologically.
Copies
of the medical examination records of 19 March 1952 (MAM 1), 26 February
1958 (MAM 2), 2 April 1962 (MAM 3), 30 January 1963 (MAM
4) and 2 April 1968
(MAM 5) confirms the state of his health.
<P>

(3)	On 10 February 1964 the plaintiff was a crew member of the aircraft carrier
HMAS Melbourne.  He was a Leading Officers Cook.
 On that day the Melbourne was
involved in joint exercises with the destroyer HMAS Voyager.
<P>

(4)	On 10 February 1964 at approximately 2056 hours Eastern Standard time a
collision occurred between the aircraft carrier HMAS
Melbourne and the
destroyer HMAS Voyager at sea about 20 miles south east of Jervis Bay (the
collision).  Eighty two men from the
Voyager lost their lives in the
collision.
<P>

(5)	At the time of the collision the plaintiff was in the Vegetable Locker of
the Wardroom Galley which was situated at 3 Port Aft.
 He was off duty and
sitting down when he felt a violent jolt.  The plaintiff was immediately
overcome with the fear that the Melbourne
was going to sink.  He does not
recall hearing any piped order. He hurried into a companion way and through an
airlock into the aircraft
hangar in 3 deck to the starboard side.  He saw and
heard what he later came to believe to be the stern end of the Voyager going
down on the Melbourne's starboard side.  The plaintiff heard a screeching,
scraping noise as the Voyager passed down the side of
the Melbourne.  He could
see the rear end of the Voyager scraping along side.  He rushed through the
hangar to the port side as he
feared they would roll to starboard and he wanted
to get to the high side of the ship to the Quarter Deck. There was great
confusion
and panic and the sound of screaming.  
<P>

(6)	When the plaintiff reached the Quarter Deck he saw the Voyager's bow on his
port side.  He realised that the Melbourne had cut
the Voyager in two.  He
feared for the safety of his shipmates and friends.  He watched as the bow sank
about 200 metres away.  He
 heard the screaming and cries for help.
<P>

(7)	The plaintiff stood stunned and shocked as he was a cook and was not
trained in rescue.  However he had been a surf life saver
at North Steyne.  He
looked over the Melbourne deck into the water on the port side and saw a raft
that had been thrown from the
Flight deck.  He went over the side of the
Melbourne into the water on a rope and halfway down he let go of the rope and
dropped
into the sea.  He swam around and eventually he was able to lash 3
rafts together.  All of the time that he was in the water he was
terrified that
he would be taken by a shark.  Someone threw a whaler oar which was about 15
foot long.  The plaintiff got into the
lead raft and was joined by 2 other
ratings who clambered into the raft.  They then swam to the raft and paddled it
towards the Voyager
about 200 yards away.  The plaintiff feared for the lives
of his shipmates and he could still hear screaming and cries for help.
<P>

(8)	They pulled aboard 4 survivors who were swimming in the water.  Another
person was too shocked and injured to swim, so the plaintiff
dived back into
the water and brought him onto the raft.  He remembers going to the castle on
the port side just aft of the main
castle.  He saw a crushed body near the
bridge and he froze with horror.  He dived back into the water and swam to the
side of the
rafts.  He heard a man screaming in the water and saw him about 20
yards away at the rear end of the Voyager.  It appeared that he
was unable to
swim and was lying half on his back in the water.  The plaintiff swam to him
and yelled out "come over here there's
a raft".  The plaintiff pulled him over
to the raft and by this stage there were more people in the 3 rafts and there
appeared to
be about 3 or 4 people in each raft.  The survivors were then
placed into a cutter and the plaintiff got onto a cutter as well and
was taken
to the Melbourne.  They were then all taken to the main galley.  The plaintiff
was exhausted having been in the water for
a period of 2 hours.  The Chief Cook
said "What's your act, trying to make out you're a survivor".  The plaintiff
said nothing. 
He thought he must have been in the water for one and half to
two hours and was exhausted.  He stayed with the survivors and looked
for his
friends.  
<P>

(9)	The plaintiff recalled that at about 2 or 3.00 am he was sitting on the
starboard when the Admiral Barge came along side with
what appeared to be two
bodies on top of the cabin.  He did not see them come aboard but just pull
along side.  He was dazed and
disorientated and then he heard that the Voyager
stern was sinking and he looked up and saw the stern go down.  He knew about 20
sailors on the Voyager.  On the trip back to Sydney the plaintiff asked
different people who were on the Voyager about the fate of
some of his friends
but no-one knew.  He knew however that he had lost a lot of friends and
ultimately ascertained that some of his
mates had died.
<P>

(10)	Between 1965 to 1968 the plaintiff had a shore posting at Balmoral.  He
feared going back to sea.  He had lost all trust in
the Navy personnel and
after the collision he began drinking heavily to try and get to sleep at night
and blot the memories out of
his mind.  He was promoted to Petty Officer. 
<P>

(11)	At the end of 1968 when it was time to renew his service with the Navy he
refused. He was too scared to go back to sea.  The
plaintiff ceased drinking
alcohol when he left the Navy.
<P>

(12)	From 10 February 1964 to the present time he has suffered from flashbacks
and he hears the scraping noise of the Voyager going
down the side of the
Melbourne.  The plaintiff now lives near the beach but is not able to go
anywhere near it. Whenever the plaintiff
was ashore whilst still serving on the
Melbourne he would drink himself senseless.  Prior to the collision he was a
very fit man
and very sports orientated.  He did not drink except for the
occasional beer.  After the collision he began drinking spirits and
would get
drunk at every opportunity.  On one occasion as a Petty Officer of HMAS Penguin
he was bar manager and he closed the bar
down and drank himself to sleep.
<P>

(13)	After the collision the plaintiff became withdrawn and distrustful of
people and this still remains the situation today.  He
also has become
argumentative and withdrawn.  He is unable to sleep because of the memories of
the night of the collision.  He feels
guilty that he was part of the crew of
the Melbourne and feels he caused the death of his friends.  
<P>

(14)	After the collision he lost interest in the Navy and all the other
activities he used to pursue including his work.  His concentration
deteriorated;  he feels that his life is worthless and he has no enthusiasm.
Sometimes he hears noises that remind him of the collision
and he becomes very
anxious.  Sometimes he is fearful of going to sleep because he fears nightmares
that he will experience of ships
colliding and of falling into a big black
hole.  He has experienced depression.  The plaintiff has had multiple
relationships and
3 marriages which were not sustained because after the
collision he became domineering and aggressive and irritable.  He also
attributed
his failure in 9 businesses to the fact that he is difficult to work
with.  
<P>

(15)	The above symptoms he experienced became normal to him.  He did not
perceive that there was anything wrong with himself.  He
was aware that he was
having problems at various times but he thought he could cope with these
normally.  He increased his alcohol
and cigarette consumption to help calm his
nerves.
<P>

(16)	Mrs M A Morgan who was the plaintiff's wife at the time of the collision
has stated that after the accident the plaintiff's
cigarette smoking increased
dramatically and this was due to stress.  The plaintiff ceased smoking on his
50th birthday, namely 2
July 1980.  
<P>

(17)	In about April 1995 the plaintiff was watching television when someone was
being interviewed who has a Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD) and that
person had a history of symptoms similar to those that the plaintiff has
experienced and still experiences.
 The plaintiff's current partner watched the
program and said to the plaintiff "That is your problem.  I think you should
look further
into it."  The plaintiff then approached the RSL who referred him
to Paul O'Keefe a Veteran's adviser.  Mr O'Keefe advised the plaintiff
to
obtain a referral to Dr Kemp and to see a solicitor.  
<P>

(18)	On about 2 May 1995 the plaintiff was referred by his general practitioner
Dr Anthony Higham to Dr John Kemp a psychiatrist.
At the conclusion of that
interview Dr Kemp informed the plaintiff that he was suffering from PTSD.  The
plaintiff discussed his
problems with the doctor including the problems that he
had previously with alcohol and smoking.  The plaintiff did not know until
Dr
Kemp explained to him that he was suffering from a psychiatric illness or
disability.  
<P>

(19)	On 29 November 1995 the statement of claim was filed.
<P>

(20)	On 8 December 1995 the notice of motion seeking an extension of the
limitation period was filed.
<P>

(21)	In December 1995 the plaintiff found that he was having some difficulty
breathing and was experiencing wheezing.  As a consequence
of these symptoms,
he was referred to Dr A R Adams a respiratory diseases specialist.  The
plaintiff consulted Dr Adams in April
1996 or sometime shortly thereafter and
it was then that he was first informed that he had emphysema which was caused
or greatly
contributed to by his smoking.
<P>

(22)	In early November 1995 the plaintiff consulted his general practitioner
concerning bowel problems that he was then experiencing.
 Shortly thereafter he
was seen by a gastro-enterologist and he thinks that it was some time in early
1996 that he underwent exploratory
surgery to determine the cause of his bowel
problems.  The plaintiff was informed that he had an irritable bowel syndrome.
It was
not until about July 1996 that the plaintiff first became aware or was
informed that his irritable bowel syndrome was contributed
to by his PTSD.
<P>

(23)	Around July 1997 the plaintiff was informed by either Dr Kemp or his
solicitor James Taylor that his PTSD caused his dramatic
increase in alcohol
and tobacco consumption as a means of self-medication and that the dramatic
increase in tobacco consumption was
a cause of his emphysema.  Prior to him
being informed he did not know that as a consequence of the collision and his
consequential
suffering of PTSD his increased tobacco intake had caused his
emphysema.
<P>

(24)	Since his discharge from the Navy the plaintiff has had 9 failed
businesses.  However over the last 20 years the plaintiff
has been employed on
and off as a vacuum cleaner salesman.  For a few years he was a very successful
salesman whereas in other years
he barely made a living.  Had it not been for
the collision, the plaintiff intended to be employed by the Navy for a period
of 30
years.
<P>

(25)	On 27 October 1995 the Department of Defence accepted the plaintiff's
claim for compensation in relation to PTSD arising from
the Voyager collision.
On 18 March 1996 the Department of Defence accepted the plaintiff's claim for
compensation for irritable bowel
syndrome arising from the Voyager
collision.
<P>

<b><u>The Law</u></b>
<P>

3  	The plaintiff relies on s 60G of the Act.  The approach to be
adopted in dealing with applications for the extension of limitation
periods,
is that which has been expounded in recent times in <b><u>Brisbane South
Regional Health Authority v Taylor</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186 CLR 541</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=139%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">139 ALR 1</a> and
in <b><u>BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Limited v Giudice (&amp; Ors)</u></b> (NSWCA,
unreported, 7 March 1997) and <b><u>The Commonwealth of Australia v
McLean</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2041%20NSWLR%20393" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 41 NSWLR 393.</a>  The onus rests with the applicant.  In
relation to ss 60G and 60I(1)(a) as to the satisfying of the relevant threshold
requirements,
it must be shown that it is just and reasonable to make an order.

<P>

4  	I turn now to ss 60G and 60I(1)(a) which are in subdivision (3)
of the Act.  The procedure provided by this group of provisions
is available
for causes of action that accrue after 1 September 1990;  but "also (by the
operation of Schedule 5) for causes of action
that accrued before that date" (s
60F).
<P>

5  	Schedule 5 provides by clause 4(1) that:
<P>

<b>"Section 60G also applies to a cause of action, founded on negligence,
nuisance or breach of duty, being a cause of action that accrued
or would have
accrued before 1 September 1990...";</b>
<P>

6  	and clause 4(4) empowers the court to make an order under s 60G
in respect of such a cause of action:
<P>

<b>"...if an application for such order is made within:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the period of three years referred to in s 60I;  or</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the period of three years commencing 1 September 1990."</b>
<P>

7  	The application to extend time was made on 8 August 1996 which is
outside the time stipulated in clause 4(4)(b).  The application
can only
succeed if that date is shown to be "within the period of three years referred
to in s 60I".
<P>

8  	Section 60G empowers the court to extend the limitation period,
if it is just and reasonable to do so, "for such period as it
determines".
<P>

9  	The relevant provisions of s 60I are as follows:
<P>

<b>"(1)	A court may not make an order under s 60G or 60H unless it is satisfied
that:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the plaintiff:</b>
<P>

<b>  (i)	did not know that personal injury had been suffered;  or</b>
<P>

<b> (ii)	was unaware of the nature or extent of personal injury suffered;
or</b>
<P>

<b>(iii)	was unaware of the connection between the personal injury and the
defendant's act or omission,</b>
<P>

<b>at the expiration of the relevant limitation period or at a time before that
expiration when proceedings might reasonably have been
instituted;  and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the application is made within three years after the plaintiff became
aware (or ought to have become aware) of all three matters
listed in paragraph
(a)(i)-(iii)."</b>
<P>

10  	Thus to gain access to the beneficial provisions of s 60G, the
plaintiff must show that:
<P>

(1)	As at 10 February 1970 (the expiration of the relevant limitation period)
he was unaware of one or more of the matters identified
in s 60I(1)(a)(i), (ii)
or (iii).
<P>

(2)	That he did not become aware of that or those or he ought to have become
aware in s 60I(1)(a) (or the last of those matters
to become known to him)
earlier than 6 December 1992.
<P>

11  	The practical effect is to require the plaintiff to identify
specifically what fact or facts he claims not to have known as
at 10 February
1970, which lack of knowledge meets the description in one or more of
paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of s 60I(1)(a);
 and to show (by evidence) the
date on which he acquired knowledge thereof (being a date later than 6 December
1992);  or to show
that that fact was or those facts were still unknown to him
on that date.  The defendant did not submit that the plaintiff ought
to have
become aware of the matters listed in paragraphs (i)-(iii) at an earlier date -
see s 60I(1)(b). 
<P>

12  	The plaintiff relies on s 60I(1)(a)(i) and (ii) in relation to
three injuries namely firstly, PTSD which caused his dramatic
increase in
alcohol and tobacco consumption, secondly, emphysema and thirdly irritable
bowel syndrome.  The plaintiff also relies
on s 60I(1)(a)(iii).
<P>

<b> (i)	<u>Whether the plaintiff has proved that he "did not know that personal
injury had been suffered</u>"</b>
<P>

13  	Prior to the expiration of the limitation period, the plaintiff
knew that he suffered from flashbacks and heard noises that
remind him of the
collision and he becomes anxious.  He is fearful of water.  He had increased
his alcohol and tobacco consumption.
 He had become withdrawn, distrustful,
domineering, aggressive and irritable.  He feared sleep because of the
likelihood of nightmares
of ships colliding.  He knew that he had been
depressed and that the onset of his depression did not occur recently but
rather was
of a longstanding nature.  Nevertheless, although he was aware of
these symptoms at various times he thought that they were normal
and that he
could cope with them. He did not perceive that there was anything wrong with
himself.  He did not recall that he suffered
from these problems as a
teenager.
<P>

14  	As was stated in the Full Federal Court in <b><u>Commonwealth of
Australia v Dinnison</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1995/1176.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] FCA 1176</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2056%20FCR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 56 FCR 389</a> (at p 402 per Gummow and Cooper
JJ) it is important to appreciate that the personal injury that the plaintiff
suffered was a psychiatric
illness.  I accept that it was not until 2 May 1995
that the plaintiff first became aware that he suffered from a diagnosable
psychiatric
illness namely PTSD.  He was previously aware that he suffered from
depression but thought that it was normal.  It is my view that
it was only when
the plaintiff became aware that he suffered a diagnosable psychiatric illness
that he knew that he suffered a personal
injury.  The plaintiff has passed
through the s 60I(1)(a)(i) gateway.
<P>

<b> (ii)	<u>Whether the plaintiff has proved that he was "unaware of the nature
and extent of the personal injury suffered</u>"</b>
<P>

15  	The test of knowledge posed by s 60I(1)(a)(ii) requires the
court to look at the actual awareness of the plaintiff.  Neither
the
reasonableness of that awareness nor constructive knowledge is an element of s
60I(1)(a) - (<b><u>Harris v Commercial Minerals Limited</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%2d96%29%20186%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995-96) 186
CLR 1</a> at pp 9 and 10).  <b><u>Harris</u></b> is a case of a disease of gradual
onset.
<P>

16  	The nature and extent of the injury which the plaintiff has
sustained is to be determined as an objective fact as at the date
of the
hearing of the application.  A plaintiff may be held to have been aware of the
nature or extent of his injury within the relevant
period if during that period
he was aware of the effect which the injury was then having upon him and of its
likely future course,
even though he may have been unaware of the precise
pathology or medical diagnosis.  In particular if the applicant was aware that
the injury would deteriorate, he or she may be aware of the extent of the
injury for the purpose of s 60I(1)(a)(ii) even though the
injury developed
particular consequences that the applicant did not precisely foresee.  As long
as the consequences are of a kind
that an applicant expects, the applicant will
be aware of the extent of the injury (<b><u>Harris</u></b> pp 13 and 14).
<P>

17  	As previously stated, prior to the expiration of the limitation
period, the plaintiff knew that he suffered from flashbacks
and heard noises
that remind him of the collision and he becomes anxious.  He became fearful of
water.  He had increased his alcohol
and tobacco consumption.  He had became
withdrawn, distrustful, domineering, aggressive and irritable.  He feared sleep
because of
the likelihood of nightmares of ships colliding.  He knew that he
had been depressed and this depression did not come on recently.
 Nevertheless,
although he was aware of these symptoms at various time he thought that they
were normal and he could cope with them.
<P>

18  	On about 2 May 1995 the plaintiff became aware that he suffered
from PTSD, a diagnosable psychiatric illness.  In April 1996
the plaintiff
became aware that he has emphysema which was caused or greatly contributed to
by his smoking.  In July 1996 the plaintiff
became aware that he suffered from
irritable bowel syndrome and that the syndrome was contributed to by his PTSD.
In July 1997 the
plaintiff was informed that as a consequence of the collision
he suffered PTSD.  To self medicate he increased his tobacco intake
and this
caused his emphysema.  The plaintiff was unaware of the nature or extent of his
injuries until July 1997.  This falls within
the period stipulated by s
60I(1)(b).  It is my view that the plaintiff has passed through the
60I(1)(a)(ii) gateway.  
<P>

<b>(iii)	<u>Whether the plaintiff was "unaware of the connection between
personal injury and the defendant's act or omission</u>"</b>
<P>

19  	Section 60I(1)(a)(iii) is concerned with ignorance of the
existence of acts and omissions rather than legal conclusions.
<P>

20  	The plaintiff submitted that it was not until he read the
statement of claim and specifically the particulars of negligence
that he was
aware of the factors that contributed to the collision and that those factors
represented acts of negligence by the defendant
its servants or agents.
<P>

21  	The acts or omissions referred to in s 60I(1)(a)(iii) are the
acts or omissions on which the plaintiff relied to found the
cause of action
referred to in s 60G.  Those acts or omissions, will be found in the
plaintiff's particulars of negligence. - <b><u>Drayton Coal Board Pty Limited v
Drain</u></b> NSWCA, Gleeson CJ, unreported 22 August 1995).
<P>

22  	In paragraph 5(a) of the statement of claim the plaintiff gives
particulars of negligence as against the officers of the Voyager.
 They are as
follows:
<P>

<b>(a)	Causing Voyager to make a turn beyond a course of 020 degrees when not
ordered to do so;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	Failing to correctly carry out orders transmitted from Melbourne to
Voyager;</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	Failing to correctly receive orders transmitted from Melbourne to
Voyager;</b>
<P>

<b>(d)	Causing or permitting Voyager to take up a course of other than that
indicated by signals from Melbourne;</b>
<P>

<b>(e)	Failing to correctly transmit as orders, signals received from
Melbourne;</b>
<P>

<b>(f)	Causing or permitting Voyager to proceed on a course across and close to
the bows of Melbourne;</b>
<P>

<b>(g)	Causing or permitting Voyager to proceed upon a course and at a speed
taking her across and close to the bows of Melbourne;</b>
<P>

<b>(h)	Failing to alter the course or speed of Voyager in time to avoid a
collision;</b>
<P>

<b>(i)	Failing to maintain a constant and efficient watch;</b>
<P>

<b>(j)	Failing to observe in sufficient time or at all that if the course and
speed of Voyager and Melbourne remained constant a collision
was likely to
occur;</b>
<P>

<b>(k)	Failing to warn Melbourne that Voyager was proceeding upon a course
across and close to the bows of Melbourne;</b>
<P>

<b>(l)	Failing to warn Melbourne that a collision was imminent;</b>
<P>

<b>(m)	Failing to give right of way to Melbourne;</b>
<P>

<b>(n)	Failing to ensure that Voyager and its equipment were in a seaworthy and
safe condition;</b>
<P>

<b>(o)	Failing to ensure that all persons on Voyager were properly trained and
prepared for the eventuality of a collision or other catastrophe;</b>
<P>

<b>(p)	Failing to maintain any or any adequate lookout.</b>
<P>

23  	Similarly, there are particulars of negligence given in relation
to the officers of the HMAS Melbourne and further particulars
of negligence of
other officers and servants of the Commonwealth of Australia.
<P>

24  	I accept that it was not until 1995 when the plaintiff read the
statement of claim that he became aware of the connection between
the personal
injury and the defendant's acts and omissions.  This falls within the time
period stipulated by s 60I(1)(b).  The plaintiff
has passed through the s
60I(1)(a)(iii) gateway.
<P>

25  	As the plaintiff has passed through all three s 60I(1)(a)
gateways, I turn to consider whether it is just and reasonable to
extend the
limitation period.
<P>

<b><u>Just and reasonable</u></b>
<P>

26  	Firstly, I turn to consider whether the plaintiff has a real
case to advance.  In relation to s 60G, the applicant bears an
evidentiary and
persuasive onus which, in the absence of concession, requires material to be
adduced which demonstrates that the
dilatory plaintiff has a real case to
advance.  The need for the court to decide that it is just and reasonable to
extend the limitation
period must focus attention on the question whether there
is indeed evidence to establish the plaintiff's cause of action.  It would
rarely be possible to say that it was just and reasonable to subject the
defendant to litigation otherwise statute barred if it did
not appear that
there was evidence available to the plaintiff to establish her cause of action.
(See <b><u>Szerdahelyi v Bailey</u></b> (NSWSC, unreported Badgery-Parker J, 1
May 1997);  <b><u>Ortado v Bailey</u></b> (NSWSC, unreported, Badgery-Parker J,
1 May 1997);  <b><u>Lewis v Bailey</u></b> (NSWSC, unreported, Badgery-Parker
J, 1 May 1997);  <b><u>Council of the City of Sydney v Zegarac</u></b>
(unreported, NSWCA, 26 February 1998) and <b><u>Dow Corning Australia Pty Ltd v
Paton</u></b>, <b><u>Meares v Paton</u></b> (NSWCA, unreported 24 April 1998)
and <b><u>Fitzgerald v Bankstown City Council</u></b> (NSWCA, unreported 6
November 1995)).
<P>

27 The plaintiff was employed by the defendant.  The defendant as an
employer had a duty of care to the plaintiff.  The foreseeability
of the
plaintiff's damage will be in issue at the trial.  It is the plaintiff's
contention that as a result of his experience of
being on board the Melbourne
when it was hit by the Voyager he suffered PTSD, excessive alcohol and tobacco
consumption, emphysema
and irritable bowel syndrome.  There is medical evidence
to support that the plaintiff suffers from these disorders which can be
attributed to the collision - see <b><u>McLean</u></b>.  There is evidence that
had he not been involved in the collision he would have continued with his
career in the Navy for at least
30 years.  The plaintiff has had 9 business
failures but has also worked on and off during the last 20 years as a vacuum
cleaner
salesman and for a few of those years he achieved high sales.  There is
medical evidence that the plaintiff is currently unfit for
work due to his
psychiatric injury.  In a medical report there is a reference that the
plaintiff's father was an alcoholic so the
cause of the plaintiff's excessive
alcohol consumption will be an issue at the trial.  There is evidence to
establish that the plaintiff
has a real cause of action to advance.
<P>

28  	I turn now to <b><u>Taylor's</u></b> case.  In
<b><u>Taylor</u></b> McHugh J at pages 8 and 9 referred to the effects of delay
in the now often quoted passage which states:
<P>

<b>"The effect of delay on the quality of justice is no doubt one of the most
important influences motivating a legislature to enact
limitation periods for
commencing actions.  But it is not the only one.  Courts and commentators have
perceived four broad rationales
for the enactment of limitation periods.
First, as time goes by, relevant evidence is likely to be lost.  Secondly, it
is oppressive,
even "cruel", to a defendant to allow an action to be brought
long after the circumstances which gave rise to it have passed.  Thirdly,
people should be able to arrange their affairs and utilise their resources on
the basis that claims can no longer be made against
them.  Insurers, public
institutions and businesses, particularly limited liability companies, have a
significant interest in knowing
that they have no liabilities beyond a definite
period."</b>
<P>

29  	and at page 11:
<P>

<b>"Legislatures enact limitation periods because they make a judgment, inter
alia, that the chance of an unfair trial occurring after
the limitation period
has expired is sufficiently great to require the termination of the plaintiff's
right of action at the end
of that period.  When a defendant is able to prove
that he or she will not now be able to fairly defend him or herself or that
there
is a significant chance that this is so, the case is no longer one of
presumptive prejudice.  The defendant has then proved what
the legislature
merely presumed would be the case.  Even on the hypothesis of presumptive
prejudice, the legislature perceives that
society is best served by barring the
plaintiff's action.  When actual prejudice of a significant kind is shown, it
is hard to conclude
that the legislature intended that the extension provision
should trump the limitation period.  In such a situation, actual injustice
to
one party must occur.  It seems more in accord with the legislative policy
underlying limitation periods that the plaintiff's
lost right should not be
revived than that the defendant should have a spent liability reimposed upon
it."</b>
<P>

30  	Dawson J, in <b><u>Taylor</u></b> said at page 2:
<P>

<b>"The onus of satisfying the court that the discretion should be exercised in
favour of an applicant lies on the applicant.  To discharge
that onus the
applicant must establish that the commencement of an action beyond the
limitation period would not result in significant
prejudice to the prospective
defendant. I agree with McHugh J that, once the legislature has selected a
limitation period, to allow
the commencement of an action outside that period
is  prima facie prejudicial to the defendant who would otherwise have the
benefit
of the limitation."</b>
<P>

31  	McHugh J at p 10 continued:
<P>

<b>"The discretion to extend should therefore be seen as requiring the
applicant to show that his or her case is a justifiable exception
to the rule
that the welfare of the State is best served by the limitation period in
question. Accordingly, when an applicant seeks
an extension of time to commence
an action after a limitation period has expired, he or she has the positive
burden of demonstrating
that the justice of the case requires that
extension."</b>
<P>

32  	In <b><u>Zegarac</u></b> the Court of Appeal considered the
effect of <b><u>Taylor</u></b> in relation to the extension of the limitation
period of a case which falls into subdivision 2 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b>
1969 - <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60c.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 60C</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">60E</a>.  
<P>

33  	Mason P analysed the views of the Judges of the High Court in
<b><u>Taylor's</u></b> case.  The President quoted the passage by McHugh J
which begins "Legislatures enact" and was of the view that Dawson J agreed with
McHugh J.  Mason P concluded that it could therefore be seen that Dawson J and
McHugh J appeared to indicate that it is mandatory
that the applicant negate
"significant prejudice" before the discretion could be exercised in his or her
favour.  Mason P then referred
to the following statement by Toohey and Gummow
JJ (in their joint judgment) at page 7:
<P>

<b>"The real question is whether the delay has made the chances of a fair trial
unlikely.  If it has not there is no reason why the discretion
should not be
exercised in favour of the respondent."</b>
<P>

34  	Mason P perceived that there may be a distinction between the
notion of "significant prejudice" and the notion that delay makes
"the chances
of a fair trial unlikely".  In determining whether it is just and reasonable to
extend the limitation period in this
application I will examine whether the
delay has made "the chances of a fair trial unlikely" or whether the defendants
would suffer
"significant prejudice".
<P>

35  	I accept that with the passing of 35 years, there is the real
possibility that some witnesses may not be available to give
evidence at the
trial.  It can also be expected that memories will have faded with the
effluxion of time.  Indisputably there is
presumptive prejudice. 
<P>

36  	Generally speaking, the lengthy delay may well confront the
defendant with a difficult task in investigating a claim for damages.
 There
are Navy records from the plaintiff's initial engagement in 1950 to April 1968
showing that at the time the plaintiff joined
the Navy and throughout his
period of service in the Navy he was in good physical and psychological health.
The events surrounding
the collision between the Melbourne and Voyager are well
known and there is documentary evidence available - see <b><u>McLean;</u></b>
<b><u>Lynch v The Commonwealth of Australia</u></b> and <b><u>Parici v The
Commonwealth of Australia</u></b> (Master Harrison, NSWSC unreported 16 October
1998 and 14 April 1999 respectively).  There are also decisions in relation to
extension
of time of the limitation period for Voyager/Melbourne claims by
Master Malpass.  In the case before me, there are more recent medical
records
of Drs Kemp, Adams, Higham, Philpott and Professor Burvill.  The plaintiff's
first wife is available to give evidence concerning
the plaintiff's consumption
of tobacco before and after the collision.  The plaintiff's brother is also
available to give evidence.
<P>

37  	After I have taken into account all of these matters,  I am not
satisfied that the "chances of the defendant obtaining a fair
trial is
unlikely" nor am I satisfied that the defendant will suffer "significant
prejudice".  The plaintiff has discharged his onus
and satisfied me that it is
just and reasonable that an order be made that the limitation period be
extended.  The appropriate order
for costs is that costs be costs in the
cause.
<P>

38  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff is granted an extension of time within which to commence
proceedings in this court for damages in respect of an
accident which occurred
on 10 February 1964 up to and including 6 December 1995.
<P>

(2)	Cost be costs in the cause.
<P>
