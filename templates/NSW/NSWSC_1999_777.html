<P>

JUDGMENT (on application to amend defence)
<P>

 
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	SGI applies for an amendment to its defence to rely on a payment, said to
have been made of an expense incurred by Mr McErlane,
as having been authorised
by Mr Drabsch rather than by Mr Lepparde, as was heretofore alleged in what has
been called in this case
the item A table.  There is background to this matter.
An earlier application was made to amend the cross claim against Mr Drabsch
in
the same fashion while Mr Drabsch was in the middle of his cross examination,
which extended over many days, and I refused that
application.  This
application covers the same factual subject matter but, as Mr Marshall of
counsel for SGI points out, is different,
in the sense that he did not then
seek to amend the defence, but only the cross claim.  He has not sought to
reopen my refusal of
the amendment of the cross claim.  The way that the matter
arises is that many of the same items are agitated by SGI, both as items
of
justification of the dismissal of Mr Drabsch by way of defence and as items of
the cross claim made against him, which it is said
that the company is entitled
to recover from Mr Drabsch as wrongly expended by him or authorised by him to
be expended.
<P>

2	Mr Marshall has, in a succinct and helpful written submission, emphasized to
me the principles now operating in these courts,
as to the circumstances in
which amendments of pleadings ought or ought not be granted.  Substantially,
those are the principles
confirmed by the High Court of Australia in <b>The
State of Queensland v JL Holdings Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20189%20CLR%20146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 189 CLR 146.</a>  Those
principles I, of course, adhere to.  
<P>

3	However, evidence has been put on which indicates that Mr Drabsch would be
prejudiced in defending an allegation cast in the way
now sought, if the
amendment were permitted.  It now appears that Mr McErlane says that this item
of expenditure was not, indeed,
ultimately borne by the company.  Either  he
paid it or, if it were in the first instance paid by the company, he reimbursed
it to
the company because it was a private expense.  He cannot now find his
financial records for 1991.  He believes they were destroyed
when he moved to
New Zealand.  What is more, the records of banks and credit card companies
through the payment, whether direct or
by way of reimbursement, may have been
made are lost.  This is illustrated by the fact that Barclays Bank indicates
that it destroys
credit card statements after six years, and that is of some
relevance, since the evidence indicates that there were other occasions
at
about the relevant time in 1991 that Mr McErlane himself made payment for such
expenses through a Barclays Bank credit card.
<P>

4	It is technically true that a case against Mr Drabsch is on the present
pleadings open on the basis that, where expenses of Mr
McErlane were authorised
by other people, Mr Drabsch should be regarded as being liable to the company
because it was he, not other
people, who should have authorised Mr McErlane's
expenses.  However, very little has been heard of that case during the course
of
the trial.  Mr Drabsch was not cross examined on it, and it seems to me a
case to be virtually impossible of success, both in its
nascence, and certainly
as the evidence now stands, some 11 or 12 weeks into the trial.  It is now
sought to face Mr Drabsch with
a different case, namely, that it was he who
made the relevant authorisation, and did so wrongfully.  This case may have
been stronger
and is certainly quite different in nature from a case that he
was responsible because, on some occasion, some other person authorised
an
expense of Mr McErlane instead of him, which, as I say, I regard as virtually
untenable on anything that I have seen or heard.
 Faced with the case, as now
sought to be raised by the amendment formulated in July of 1999, it seems to me
that the evidence that
has been led quite specifically shows that he will be
under prejudice through loss of records in establishing his defence to the
matter if it is allowed to be brought forward now.  By this I mean that he
would be subject to prejudice immediately after the allowance
of the amendment
that he was not subject to immediately before it.  In view of the fact that
those documents are now lost, that prejudice
cannot be cured by an order for
costs, nor has any other way of meeting the situation been suggested.  In these
circumstances, the
application for amendment of the defence is refused.
<P>

5	I should say, so that it is clear, that I am quite well aware that matters
relating to this subject matter may well be able to
be put to the remaining
witnesses, particularly Mr McErlane, as going to their credit; nonetheless, I
think it inappropriate that
the amendment be allowed.  The application is
refused.
