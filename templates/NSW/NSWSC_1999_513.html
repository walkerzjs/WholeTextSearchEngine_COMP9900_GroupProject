<i>Monday, 31 May 1999</i>
<P>

<b>1973/99	KIAMA DEVELOPMENT CO PTY LIMITED   -v-   ROSANNA WILCOX AND
ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER: </b>By summons filed on 12 April 1999 the
plaintiff, Kiama Development Co Pty Limited, seeks an order that the document
headed Statutory
Demand dated and served on the plaintiff by the defendants on
24 March 1999 be set aside. The defendants named in the summons are
Rosanna
Wilcox, Birgitta Spicer, John Spicer and Graham Wilcox.  
<P>

2   	The document to which the summons refers is headed
Creditors Statutory Demand for Payment of Debt.  It follows precisely the
form
set forth in Form 509 H (2) contained in Schedule 2 to the Regulations under
the <i>Corporations Law</i>.  It requires payment by the plaintiff of the sum
of $96,205.58.  That alleged debt is described in the schedule to the demand as
follows:-
<P>

Judgment entered by the District Court of New South Wales, Sydney (proceedings
number 1839 of 1999) in favour of the creditor on
15 March 1999 $96,205.58.
<P>

3   	Paragraph 6 of the demand states the address of the
creditor for service of copies of any application and affidavits is care
of
Heckenberg &amp; Associates, Solicitors, level 3, 185 Elizabeth Street, Sydney,
NSW 2000, DX 644 Sydney.
<P>

4   	The summons to set aside the demand and the affidavit in
support were received by Heckenberg &amp; Associates on 28th April
1999 under
cover of a letter dated 23 April 1999.  It would appear, however, that a copy
of the summons and affidavit in support
were on 21 April 1999 received by
another firm of solicitors, Martins.  That firm does not act for the defendants
in the present
proceedings and it is not referred to in the statutory
demand.
<P>

5   	There has been placed in evidence before me a certificate
of Judgment in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney in
proceedings
No. 1839 of 1999.  That certificate is dated 22 March 1999. Paragraph 1 of that
certificate is in the following terms:-
<P>

In this action the plaintiffs recovered Judgment against the defendants on 15
March 1999 in the sum of $96,205.58 and its costs
zero dollars and zero
cents.
<P>

6   	There has also been placed in evidence a certificate as to
determination of costs from Costs Assessor, M L Bradazon, issued
on 5 March
1999 which includes the following:
<P>

This application is determined by assessing as a fair and reasonable amount of
costs to be paid to the applicant the sum of $96,205.58.
 
<P>

7   	There is no evidence before the Court which discloses that
any application has been made to the District Court for a stay of
execution
upon the judgment recovered by the present defendants as a judgment creditor as
against the plaintiff as one of a number
of judgment debtors.
<P>

8   	I here note that Mr Knaggs, Solicitor for the present
plaintiff, sought an adjournment of the hearing to enable him to ascertain
whether an application for a stay of execution upon the judgment had been filed
in the District Court. Since the judgment was entered
two and a half months ago
and since there was no evidence of any application having been made to the
District Court before today,
I refused any such adjournment.
<P>

9   	Mr Knaggs, on behalf of the present plaintiff, submitted
that I should go behind that judgment.  Where there is a judgment
of the
District Court of New South Wales, where there is a no application to set aside
that judgment, and where there has been no
stay of execution upon that
judgment, I consider that, firstly, I do not have the power to go behind the
judgment; secondly, even
if I did have that power, I certainly would not in
those circumstances do so.
<P>

10   	So far as the substance of the present proceedings is
concerned --- that is, whether there is any ground upon which I should
set
aside the statutory demand in accordance with the provisions of Division 3 of
Part 5.4 of the <i>Corporations Law</i> --- I am not satisfied that there is a
genuine dispute between the plaintiff and the defendants about the existence or
the amount
of the debt to which the demand relates.  
<P>

11   	However, there are two further aspects of the proceedings
to which I should refer.  Firstly it has been submitted on behalf
of the
defendants that the present proceedings are not an application of the nature
contemplated by Division 3 of Part 5.4, in that
they do not comply with the
requirements of section 459 G of the <i>Corporations Law</i>.  Subsection (2)
of that section provides that an application for an order setting aside a
statutory demand may only be made within
twenty one days after the demand is
served.  In the circumstances of the instant case, that twenty one day period
expired on 15 April
1999.
<P>

12   	Subsection 3 of section 459 G provides:-
<P>

That such an application is made in accordance with that section only if,
within those 21 days:
<P>

(a)	an affidavit supporting the application is filed with the Court; and
<P>

(b)	a copy of the application, and a copy of the supporting affidavit, are
served on the person who served the demand on the company.
<P>

13   	Whilst the affidavit supporting the application (being the
affidavit of John Desmond French, sworn 6 April 1999), was filed
within the
twenty one day period, neither a copy of the summons nor a copy of that
affidavit were within that period served on the
person who served the demand on
the company.
<P>

14   	In the light of the address of the creditor for service of
copies of any application and affidavits set forth in paragraph
6 of the
demand, the failure of the present plaintiff to serve the copy of the summons
and a copy of the affidavit of Mr French upon
the present defendants care of
Heckenberg &amp; Associates at the address disclosed in paragraph 6 of the
demand within the twenty
one day period is fatal to the present proceedings.
In that regard, I would refer to the decision of the High Court of Australia
in
<i>David Grant &amp; Co. Pty Limited -v- Westpac Banking Corporation Limited
</i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 43</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20184%20CLR%20265" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994), 184 CLR, 265</a> at 278, being the judgment of Gummow J with whom the
other members of the Court agreed; and also to <i>Centurion Constructions Pty
Limited V Beca Developments Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2014%20ACLC%20312" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 14 ACLC 312</a>, a decision of
McLelland CJ in Eq. Since the proceedings were not instituted in the manner
required by section 459 G, the summons
must inevitably be dismissed.  
<P>

15   	The Court has no power to extend the twenty one day
period, as was decided by the High Court of Australia in David Grant &amp;
Co.
Limited v Westpac Banking Corporation. Although without opposition by the
defendants, the plaintiff filed in Court this day,
31 May 1999, a Notice of
Motion seeking orders that the time for service of the summons and affidavit be
extended until the date
upon which those documents were in fact served upon
Heckenberg &amp; Associates and that service of those documents be deemed to
have taken place at that time. The Court has no power to grant that relief.
<P>

16   	It has also been submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that
the form of the statutory demand is inconsistent with the requirements
prescribed by section 459 G.  Subsection (1) of that section provides that a
company may apply to the Court for an order setting
aside a statutory demand
served on the company.  Subsection 2 requires that such an application be made
within twenty one days after
the demand is so served.  The phrase "statutory
demand" is defined in section 9 of the <i>Corporations Law </i>as meaning,
relevantly, a document that is, or purports to be, a demand served under
section 459 E.
<P>

17   	The form which is prescribed by the Regulations, being
Form 509 H in Schedule 2 to the Regulations made under the <i>Corporations Law
</i>(which was, as I have already recorded, followed by the defendants in the
present proceedings) includes as paragraph 5 the following:-
<P>

section 459 G of the Corporations Law provides that a company served with a
demand may apply to a court having jurisdiction under
the Corporations Law for
an order setting the demand aside.  An application must be made within 21 days
after the demand is served
and, within the same period;
<P>

(a)	an affidavit supporting the application must be filed with the court;
and
<P>

(b)	a copy of the application and a copy of the affidavit must be served on the
person who served the demand.
<P>

18   	It is submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the form
of the demand in the instant case, and indeed the form prescribed
by the
Regulations to the <i>Corporations Law</i>, is inconsistent with the provisions
of section 459 G, since paragraph 5 of the form refers to a 'demand' and not to
a 'statutory
demand'.  It is submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that
paragraph 5 in the notice should refer to a company served with a 'statutory
demand' being entitled to apply to a Court.
<P>

19   	The reason, so it is submitted, why the form should refer
to a statutory demand is that the definition of statutory demand
in section 9
is a demand that has been served under section 459 E.  
<P>

20   	I do not consider that the form which is prescribed in
Schedule 2 to the Regulations, being Form 509 H, is in any way inconsistent
were the provisions of section 459 G, or is in any way inconsistent with the
provisions of section 459 E.  I do not consider that
the form prescribed in the
Regulations or the form which is used in the instant case can in any way be in
any way treated as being
<i>ultra vires</i>.  I am quite satisfied that the
demand which was served upon the plaintiff is a demand which has been served
under section 459 E.
 
<P>

21   	But even if (contrary to the conclusion which I have just
expressed) the reference in paragraph 5 to a company served with
a 'demand' is
an inappropriate reference, that fact of itself would not, in my view, have any
effect upon the demand which has been
served upon the plaintiff, or upon the
failure of the plaintiff to comply with that demand.
<P>

22   	Paragraph 5 of the demand sets forth certain rights to
which the debtor company is entitled.  Unless it can be suggested that
the
debtor company has somehow been misled by paragraph 5 concerning its rights, it
seems to me that even if the submissions of the
plaintiff in this regard were
correct, that fact would have no effect upon the consequences of the demand or
of the failure of the
plaintiff to comply with it.  
<P>

23   	I summarise therefore as follows my foregoing views.
<P>

24   	The present proceedings were not instituted in the manner
required by section 459 G, since the summons and the affidavit were
not served
upon the defendants within the twenty one day period required by subsection (2)
of that section.  I consider that the
form of demand following Form 409 H in
Schedule 2 to the Regulations made under the <i>Corporations Law, </i>is
appropriate in these circumstances of this case. There is no inconsistency
between the form presently used and the requirements
of section 459 E.  The
form of the demand is a demand under section 459 E and therefore, comes within
the definition contained in
section 9 of "statutory demand".
<P>

25   	Even if paragraph 5 of the demand was inappropriately
worded and should have included the phrase 'statutory demand' where
the word
'demand' appears in the first sentence thereof, I do not consider that the
effect of the use of the  word 'demand' would
have any consequences other than
those which flow from the failure of the plaintiff to comply with the demand,
either by paying the
amount of the debt within the specified period of twenty
one days, or by instituting proceedings of the nature contemplated under
section 459 G within that period.
<P>

26   	Further, there is no evidence whatsoever upon which the
Court could possibly conclude that there is any genuine dispute as
to either
the indebtedness of the plaintiff to the defendants, or the amount of that
indebtedness.  There is a Certificate of Judgment
of the District Court of New
South Wales in evidence in the present proceedings in the amount claimed by the
present defendants against
the plaintiff. There is no evidence that any
application has ever been made, either to set aside that judgment or to seek a
stay
of execution thereof.  
<P>

27   	Accordingly, I propose to order that the summons be
dismissed.
<P>

I make the following orders:
<P>

(i)	I order that the summons be dismissed.
<P>

(ii)	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the defendant, such costs to
be on the party and party basis up to and including
12 May 1999, and thereafter
to be on the indemnity basis.
<P>

The exhibits may be returned.
