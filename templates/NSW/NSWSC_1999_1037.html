<b>50076/1998 - ABB ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION PTY LIMITED   v   FREIGHT RAIL
CORPORATION</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	These proceedings were commenced by a Summons filed on 29
June 1998, which was amended by an Amended Summons filed on 18 December
1998 to
which the defendant filed a Defence on 22 January 1999.  By a Notice of Motion
filed in Court on 24 September 1999 the defendant
sought an order, pursuant to
Part 31 rule 2, that the hearing of the issue of liability be heard separately
from and in advance of
that of quantum, to which order the plaintiff consented.
The question is whether I should make the order.
<P>

2   	Part 31 rule 2, provides:-
<P>

<b>"2.	The Court may make orders for:-</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the decision of any question separately from any other question, whether
before, at or after any trial or further trial in the
proceedings; and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	...."</b>
<P>

3   	In relation to such an application, the authors of
Ritchie's "Supreme Court Procedure", at paragraph 31.2.5, state:-
<P>

<b>"It is a relatively frequent occurrence for questions of liability and
damages to be tried separately.  This will be appropriate in
various instances.
For example, separate determination may be ordered where there is a clear line
of demarcation between liability
and damages issues ... .   If the assessment
of damages is particularly complex separate determination may be appropriate
... and
this may be the case in personal injury matters where there is an
element of uncertainty about the plaintiff's prognosis, which is
best resolved
by delaying the damages assessment until medical conditions have stabilised ...
.   Even aside from these instances
the Court may order separate trial of
liability and damages whenever it considers that it is appropriate to do so
...."</b>
<P>

The authors then note that leave is required to appeal from any separate
determination of liability issues.
<P>

4   	Whilst such applications were reasonably frequent in the
Commercial Division and the Commercial List in the past, they have
become less
so because, I am sure, of the Court's reluctance to accede to them, a
reluctance stemming from the view that the making
of such an order usually
results in litigation becoming more and more time consuming, costly and
inefficient.  My experience has
been that the ordering of separate questions is
only appropriate and only has a beneficial effect, when there is a discrete
question,
which will be determinative of the litigation, and the parties agree
what judgment will follow from the answering of that question.
<P>

5   	At the conclusion of submissions I stated that I did not
propose to accede to the application, but I reserved my decision so
that I
could state, I hope, with more precision than an <i>ex tempore</i> judgment
delivered in a busy Friday list may have allowed, my reasons for refusing the
application.
<P>

<b>The Issues</b>
<P>

6   	By its Amended Summons the plaintiff states the "Nature of
Dispute" to be:-
<P>

<b>"In 1995 State Rail Authority of New South Wales (`SRA') called for tenders
in relation to the manufacture of coal vehicles.  The
plaintiff entered into a
contract with SRA for the tender process (`the Tender Process
Contract').</b>
<P>

<b>The plaintiff alleges that SRA, by its conduct, breached the terms of the
Tender Process Contract thus causing loss and damage to
the plaintiff.  The
benefit and burden of the Tender Process Contract were transferred from SRA to
the defendant with effect from
1 July 1996.  The plaintiff alleges that the
defendant is liable to compensate the plaintiff for the loss and damage caused
by the
breaches of the Tender Process Contract."</b>
<P>

7   	Under the heading "Issues Likely to Arise", it was stated
that they were whether SRA breached the terms of the Tender Process
Contract;
whether the defendant is liable to the plaintiff in respect of any such
breaches; and the measure of the plaintiff's loss.
<P>

8   	It was pleaded that:- 
<P>

(a)	SRA called for tenders for the design, manufacture, supply, testing,
delivery and placing into service for up to 800 coal vehicles
on or about 1
February 1995 and that, prior to the tender closing, the plaintiff lodged a
tender in accordance with the specifications;

<P>

(b)	on 12 April 1995 the plaintiff and SRA entered into a contract for the
tender; 
<P>

(c)	it was a term of that contract that SRA would comply with the New South
Wales Government Code of Tendering for the construction
industry; with the
requirements of the New South Wales Government Code of Practice for the
construction industry; and that SRA would
be fair to all tenderers and only
consider tenders complete in all respects and lodged by the tender closing
time, and would engage
in the highest standards of ethical behaviour and fair
dealing;
<P>

(d)	on or about 24 November 1995 SRA informed the plaintiff that its tender had
been unsuccessful and, shortly thereafter, awarded
a contract to another party;
and
<P>

(e)	SRA breached the Tender Process Contract by entertaining and ultimately
accepting a revised proposal from the other tenderer
that did not comply with
the requirements pleaded; by allowing significant revision of that tender after
it was submitted; by inviting
the other tenderer, in or about May 1995, to make
a further submission for the specification which contained a revised and more
favourable
door alignment arrangement; by accepting from the other tenderer, in
or about June 1995, a major revision to the original tender;
and by further
accepting from the other tenderer a more detailed design of transfer stores for
the coal vehicles the subject of the
specification in or about November
1995.
<P>

9   	It was pleaded that there were a number of implied terms
and that the various terms pleaded were breached, whereby the plaintiff
lost
the opportunity of obtaining the contract for the specification work, that if
successful the plaintiff would have made substantial
cost savings and profits
"further particulars of which will be provided", and that the plaintiff has
wasted the costs incurred in
tendering for the specification.
<P>

10   	The Defence, essentially, alleges that there was no
contract, but rather, as I infer, an invitation to enter into a contract,
and,
alternatively, that if there was a contract none of its terms were breached.
It was also pleaded that the plaintiff suffered
no loss or damage.
<P>

11   	The issues thus propounded raise an unexceptional case of
an allegation by the plaintiff that it entered into a contract with
the
defendant, which contract the defendant breached in consequence of which the
plaintiff suffered damage.
<P>

<b>The Basis On Which The Order Was Sought</b>
<P>

12   	It was submitted that the advantages of having liability
heard separately from and in advance of damages were, firstly, that
in the
event of a determination in favour of the defendant, there would be no need for
the parties and, more particularly the defendant,
to incur the expense of the
preparation of a hearing on damages.  Secondly, it was submitted that a finding
in favour of the plaintiff
would allow for any technical matters on damages,
such as engineering and/or accounting questions, to be referred to a referee;
and
that the question of damages could focus with greater precision on the
appropriate questions for any expert as to the measure of
any damages.  The
plaintiff, although consenting to the order, maintained that it would be
pursuing the claim for damages and, if
unsuccessful on the question of
liability, would, in all probability, be seeking leave to appeal to the Court
of Appeal.
<P>

13   	It was further submitted that on the face of the evidence
served by the plaintiff there did not appear to be any overlapping
of witnesses
on the issues of liability and damages, such that there may be a prospect of
inconsistent findings or difficulty in
cross-examining if those issues were
heard separately; and that in the event of an appeal, assuming that leave to
appeal was granted,
the appeal would be limited to the issue of liability "and
not complicated by any issues of quantum".
<P>

14   	The final submission, in paragraph 20, referred to an
affidavit of Ms Hayes, which was said to deal with the estimated length
and
costs of a hearing on liability and quantum.  No such affidavit was furnished
and, accordingly, the submission was not pressed.
<P>

<b>Reasons For Refusing The Application</b>
<P>

15   	The first reason why, in my opinion, the application
should be refused is that, as was conceded in argument, there is no guarantee
that certain witnesses will not give evidence on the issues of liability and
damages.  Whilst the plaintiff stated it had filed all
its evidence in chief,
it did not rule out the possibility that evidence in reply may be filed from a
witness going to both issues.
 In my view, it would require an exceptional case
for the Court to order a separate hearing of liability and damages when any
witness
is likely to give evidence on both issues.  The reasons are obvious.  A
case should be conducted on the basis that the witness is
cross-examined on all
issues at the same time and in the context of all issues, because his or her
evidence on one issue may impact
on the acceptability of his or her evidence on
the other.  If there is not adherence to this practice difficult questions
arise for
the Court as to the extent to which cross-examination on the matter
not being litigated should be allowed, and for the cross-examiner
as to how far
matters not in issue can and/or should be pursued, and how that evidence should
be treated in the overall assessment
of the witness.  In my opinion, the
cross-examiner should not be precluded, particularly where credit is in issue,
from cross-examining
on the issue of damages merely because the only matter
being litigated is liability.  That not only causes difficulties for the
cross-examiner,
but also for the Court.  The Court may be prevented from making
a fully informed assessment of the credibility of the witness if
the
cross-examination is truncated, or if certain contradictory material cannot be
led because the cross-examination goes only to
credit and not to an issue.
<P>

16   	A further difficulty, in these circumstances, is that if a
Judge hearing the issue of liability makes any finding as to the
credit of a
witness, who is subsequently to give evidence in the event of the question of
damages being litigated, that Judge will,
in all probability, be disqualified
from hearing the matter and, accordingly, the store of knowledge he or she has
obtained from
the initial hearing is lost, as is the impact of the evidence
upon him or her: <b>Australian National Industries Limited v Spedley Securities
Limited (In Liquidation)</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2026%20NSWLR%20411" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 26 NSWLR 411.</a> The finding may not
necessarily have to be an adverse one to have this result. This is but one
consequence, which leads to an inefficient
use of the Court's and the parties'
time and resources.
<P>

17   	The next reason why I do not consider it appropriate to
make the order is that I proceed on the assumption that the plaintiff,
in
bringing the litigation, believes it is entitled to damages.  In the present
case that has been confirmed.  Two matters flow from
that.  Firstly, if the
plaintiff does not succeed on the issue of liability there is a strong
likelihood that an application will
be made for leave to appeal and, if that
application and the appeal are successful, the issue of damages will have to be
addressed,
possibly, in this case, but probably in most, by another Judge.
Once the issue of damages is decided another application can be made
for leave
to appeal, thus prolonging the litigation even further.  I have left out of
this equation any application for special leave
to appeal to the High Court. I
see nothing efficient, in the administration of justice, in the sense of
bringing about finality to
litigation, or in the utilisation of the time and
resources available to the Court and the parties, to have, in the general run
of
case, four potential hearings.  In fact it seems to me an entirely
inefficient use of such time and resources.  It also means that
the time during
which the litigation is on foot is lengthened to a substantial extent.  This is
not in the interests of the Court
or the parties.  A real objective of the
Commercial List is to have cases resolved quickly, so that parties will know
what their
respective financial positions are.  The presently suggested
approach thwarts that aim, with the resulting financial detriment to
the
parties.
<P>

18   	Secondly, the costs of proving damages, on the assumption
that the defendant is liable, will have to be incurred in any event.
 A
plaintiff, bringing forward a case bona fide, must confront that, as must a
defendant facing such a case.  To suggest that the
costs will be saved if the
issue of liability is determined first is to make the pessimistic assumption
that the plaintiff will not
succeed on it at first instance or on appeal.
<P>

19   	My next reason is that until there has been an assessment
by the parties of the amount to which each says the plaintiff, if
successful on
the issue of liability, would be entitled, there can be no meaningful
consideration by the parties of what the financial
stake in issue is.  In those
circumstances, the parties are unable to give proper thought to an appropriate
commercial settlement,
consideration of which will be dependent not only on the
amount involved, but also on the risk inherent in the issue of liability.
 In
my opinion, it is highly desirable for parties involved in commercial
litigation to focus on the whole case in determining how
it can best be
resolved.
<P>

20   	Finally, I consider that in most cases, (and this does not
seem an exceptional one), a Judge at first instance should decide
as many
issues as possible, so that in the event of an appeal the Court of Appeal will
be in a position to dispose of the matter
finally, if it seems appropriate to
that Court to do so.
<P>

21   	All of these matters, taken in isolation or in the
aggregate, constitute compelling reasons why, at least in the normal run
of
case of which I think this is one, there should be no separation of issues.  I
have expressed similar views on a number of previous
occasions: e.g.
<b>McLernon Group (Insurances) v Kelly &amp; Ors</b> (1 October 1999,
unreported).
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

22   	As the plaintiff consented to the making of the order, the
fact that the defendant has failed should not mean, in my opinion,
that the
proper exercise of discretion demands that the defendant pays the plaintiff's
costs.  Rather there should be no order as
to costs.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

23   	I order that the Notice of Motion filed on 24 September
1999 be dismissed.  I make no order as to costs.
