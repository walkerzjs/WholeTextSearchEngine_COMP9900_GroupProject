<b>OF NEW SOUTH WALES</b>

<b>EQUITY DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>YOUNG, J</b>
<P>

<b>THURSDAY 3 JUNE 1999</b>
<P>

<b>1990/99 - HUGH CHARLES GORDON V ALLIED MERIDIAN PTY LTD &amp; ORS (NO
2)</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b> This morning I made orders in accordance with short
minutes, after discussion, to dispose of these proceedings in which I had given
judgment on 28 May 1999.
<P>

2	One of the unusual aspects of the case is that because of certain of my
findings of fact the loser, if cards fall out in a particular
way, may end up
the eventual winner.  For this reason Mr Webb, who appears for the main
defendants, has asked for leave to file a
cross-claim so that the findings in
the present proceedings can be used in the next round, without running the risk
of any problems
of issue estoppel.  This has been resisted by the plaintiff.
<P>

3	The Supreme Court Rules do have a bias towards having all the matters decided
at the one time and dealing with any legitimate
cross-claims at the same time
as the claim.
<P>

4	However, the cases on the current Rules and the corresponding old Rules and
the English Rules are that essentially whether a cross-claim
should be allowed
or the claimant left to pursue a separate action is one of general convenience:
<b> Gray v Webb</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281882%29%2021%20Ch%20D%20802" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1882) 21 Ch D 802.</a>
<P>

5	 I cannot see how it is convenient after the whole claim has been decided,
following a three day hearing and orders made, for
a cross-claim to be then
filed and determined, as opposed to a new action, forensic advantages put to
one side.  I can understand
how this could possibly be so where the cross-claim
was for indemnity, but even then there may be questions of fairness and
convenience.
 In the present case, there are no countervailing factors.
<P>

6	Accordingly, I am not of the view it would be convenient for the cross-claim
to be dealt with in these proceedings and I decline
to give the leave.
<P>

7	The costs of the application for leave to file a cross-claim are to be paid
by the defendants for whom Mr Webb appears.
<P>

                                  	o0o
<P>

   
<P>
