<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR : </b> The plaintiff was the purchaser and the first defendant
was the vendor in Contract for Sale of Land dated 11 March 1998;  sale of
vacant land at 146-148 Mulgoa Road Penrith, Lot 12 DP868453 for $415,000.00.  A
deposit of $20,750.00 was provided for and was paid
to the vendor's agent;
Zamoford Pty Ltd trading as Richardson &amp; Wrench, the second defendant still
holds the deposit, filed a
submitting appearance and took no active part in the
litigation.  The Contract provided that the completion date was the 42nd day
after the date of Contract, that is 22 April 1998; this date was not made of
the essence.
<P>

2	The purchaser claims that the Contract was validly rescinded by the purchaser
by a Notice of Rescission delivered to the vendor
and its solicitors on 5 May
1998;  that the purchaser is entitled to return of the deposit and if not so
entitled that the Court
should order the return of the deposit under the
discretionary powers in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55</a> (2A) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</i> 1919</a>.  The
vendor claims that the Contract was terminated by a Notice to Complete
delivered on 22 July 1998 requiring completion on 7
August 1998 (but later
extended by arrangement between the parties to 28 August 1998) followed by
termination by the vendor on 31
August 1998;  and Cross-claims for orders
establishing that its termination was effective, that it is entitled to the
deposit held
by the deposit holder and a further $20,750.00 (being the balance
of the deposit to 10%) under a special condition of the Contract,
damages and
interest.
<P>

3	The purchaser's position is that it was entitled to rescind because there was
a substantial misdescription of the property sold
in the Contract, and also
because it was induced to enter into the Agreement by misrepresentations made
by and on behalf of the vendor
which were material, although innocent.
Rescission for innocent misrepresentation and refusal of specific performance
on the ground
of substantial misdescription are equitable remedies;  they are
discretionary and it is not wholly within the power of a party to
bring about a
rescission of a Contract for Sale of Land on either basis.  Rescission on those
grounds is the act of the Court not
of the party, occurs at the time of the
Court's order and is accompanied by whatever other orders if any are
appropriate to bring
about an equitable adjustment of the rights of both
parties.  Because of the discretionary nature of the remedies it is not
possible
to be entirely dogmatic in asserting that a party to a Contract is
entitled to rescission on these grounds, although according to
the
circumstances it may be fairly clear what the outcome would be.
<P>

4	When it purchased the property the purchaser had a clear view of what it
intended to do with the property when it got title; 
it intended to proceed
straight away to build a multi-unit housing development of nine units in
accordance with a development consent
and building plans which had been
approved by the Penrith City Council, the development consent being DA
No.234/93 granted on 29
October 1993.  Mr Anthony Brischetto, a director who
conducted this aspect of its business, saw an advertisement published in the
<i>"Penrith Press"</i> by the vendor's selling agents, which showed an outline
plan of the approved development and included the statements:-
<P>

	<i>"DA and BA approved</i>
<P>

<i>	Contributions Paid</i>
<P>

<i>	Start work immediately"</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

5	He was also shown the development application and stamped building plans, and
a copy of a letter dated 3 November 1995 written
on behalf of the Environmental
Planning Manager at Penrith City Council to Mr T J Willis in these terms
(Exhibit B5):-
<P>

	<i>"Extension to Development Consent DA 2341/93 dated 29th October 1993</i>
<P>

<i>	Lots 1 &amp; 2 DP611167 Mulgoa Road Penrith</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	I refer to your request for an extension to the abovementioned development
consent.  You are advised that the consent is still valid.
 This is because
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s99.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 99</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act</a> was amended on 1st
July 1993 so that all development consents would be valid for a period of five
years from the date of approval
unless the consent authority resolves
otherwise.  As the subject development consent was still valid at the time of
this amendment,
it automatically became valid for a period of five years from
the date of approval.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	I can be contacted on the above number should have have any
enquiries."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

6	Correspondence written on behalf of the Council on 9 September 1996 (not so
far as evidence shows to any party to these proceedings)
shows continued belief
by Council's officers then that the Development Consent was current.
<P>

<i>7	</i>A certificate issued by Penrith City Council on 20 August 1997 under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
149</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act</i> 1979</a> formed part of
the Contract of Sale.  There is no clear statement in the printed form which
shows what part the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> certificate plays in the parties' contractual
relationship.  The Contract included a list of documents which were attached;
there
were two spaces referring to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> certificate, both of which were
marked;  one space included among the documents attached <i>"<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">S149</a> (2)

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">Subsection 149</a> (2) requires that a planning certificate specify prescribed
matters relating to the land, and these<i> </i>are collected in the certificate
(Exhibit A pages 21-26) under the heading<i> "<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/index.html#p1" class="autolink_findacts">PART 1</a> PRESCRIBED MATTERS."
</i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">Subsection 149</a> (5) provides:-
<P>

<i>	"A council may, in a planning certificate, include advice on such other
relevant matters affecting the land of which it may be aware."</i>
<P>

8	The matter which Council stated in exercise of this discretionary power
appears under an identifying heading at A26-A27 and included:-
<P>

	<i>"Development consent pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s92.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 92</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning
and Assessment Act, 1979</a>, has been granted over the subject property.  A brief
description of the proposed development, the development notice number and
the
date of consent are as follows:</i>
<P>

<i>	Multi Unit Housing Development - 9 Units;  234/93;  29.10.93"</i>
<P>

9	Printed condition 10.1.5 relates to <i>"Restrictions on rights of
purchaser"</i> and includes:-
<P>

	<i>"The purchaser cannot make a claim or requisition or rescind or terminate
in respect of  - </i>
<P>

<i>	....</i>
<P>

<i>	....10.1.5 a promise, representation or statement about this Contract, the
property or the title, not set out or referred to in this
Contract;</i>
<P>

<i>	...."</i>
<P>

10	Printed clause 6 provides:-
<P>

	<i>"Error or misdescription</i>
<P>

<i>	The purchaser can (but only before completion) claim compensation for an
error or misdescription in this Contract (as to the property,
the title or
anything else whether substantial or not)."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

11	Special condition 31 provides (A8):-
<P>

	<i>"The purchaser acknowledges that the purchaser entered into this Contract
relying on the purchasers own inspections, knowledge and
enquiries and that the
purchaser does not rely on representations made to them by or on behalf of the
vendor and the parties Contract
that there have been no warranties and no
Contract, conditions and undertakings made between the parties hereto other
than those
in writing contained in this Contract."</i>
<P>

12	By special condition 35 a Notice to Complete of 14 days was sufficient.
<P>

13	Special condition 39 provides (A10):-
<P>

	<i>"The Vendor warrants that:</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)  It own the plans comprised in Development Application No. 234/93 and
Building Application No. 970330 and indemnifies the Purchaser
against any
claims made by the architect in relation to the plans;</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)  It has paid all Council and Sydney Water contributions relating to
Development Application No. 234/93 and Building Application
No. 970330 and
indemnifies the Purchaser against any claims made by the Council or Sydney
Water in relation to the contributions."</i>
<P>

14	In truth and in fact the Development Consent 234/1993 dated 29 October 1993
could no longer be relied on on 11 March 1998 or
22 April 1998 to carry out
development work on the land and it would have been unlawful to start work
immediately, or to start work
at all on the development to which that consent
related.  Duration and lapse of consent DA234/93 were governed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s99.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 99</a> of<i>
</i>the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act </i>1979</a> in the form which
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s99.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 99</a> took on 1 July 1993 when amendments made by the <i>Local Government
(Consequential Provisions) Act </i>32 of 1993 commenced.  The short effect of
those provisions was that a development consent lapses five years after the
date from which
it operates (subsection (1) ) that the consent authority in
granting development consent might vary that period (subsection (2) )
but not
to under two years (subsection (3) (a) ) and development consent for the
erection of a building does not lapse if work is
physically commenced
(subsection (4) ).  By subsection (4B), where the period to lapse has been
reduced to less than five years the
applicant or any other person entitled to
act on the consent might apply before expiry for an extension of one year;
there is a discretion
to grant the extension if satisfied that the applicant
had shown good cause (subsection (4C) )and an extension of one year if granted
commences to run from the later of the date on which the consent would have
otherwise lapsed and the date of grant of the extension
(subsection (4E) ).
<P>

15	I set out the full terms of subsection (4E), to which I will return:-
<P>

	<i>"An extension of 1 year granted under this section commences to run from
the later of the following:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)  the date on which the consent would have elapsed but for the </i>
<P>

<i>	     extension;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b) the date on which the consent authority granted the extension </i>
<P>

<i>	    or, if the Court has allowed the extension in determining an </i>
<P>

<i>	    appeal, the date on which the Court determined the appeal."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>16	</i>Other provision was made by amendments effected by the<i>
Environmental Planning and Assessment Amendment Act </i>1997 No 81 of 1997
which commenced on 1 July 1998, but the operation of s 99 in its previous form
was continued in respect of existing
determinations by the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/epaaatr1998720/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental
Planning and Assessment (Savings and Transitional) Regulation </i>1998</a> clause
16.  From 1 July 1993 until 1 July 1998 there was no amendment to s 99, except
for correction of a drafting error by the <i>Statute Law (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act</i> (No 2) No 108 of 1993.
<P>

17	The vendor offered no significant evidence and did not explain itself, but
it would seem that Penrith City Council's officers
and also the vendor
overlooked or forgot or for some reason were unaware of condition 3 of
development consent DA 234/93 in these
words (Exhibit B2):-
<P>

	<i>"This consent shall lapse if the development to which it refers is not
commenced within two (2) years after the date of the consent;
 provided that
Council may, if good cause be shown in a written application requesting an
extension of time, grant an extension of
the consent for a further twelve
months pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s99.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 99(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment
Act, 1979</a>."</i>
<P>

18	By 29 October 1993 the relevant provision was no longer <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s99.html" class="autolink_findacts">subsection 99</a> (3)
but had become <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s99.html" class="autolink_findacts">subsection 99</a> (4C).
<P>

19	It appears from slight scraps of information in evidence that in or by
October 1995 Mr T J Willis requested an extension of the
development consent,
and that Council then did not deal with and decide the application for an
extension because it had lost sight
of condition 3;  and it seems likely that
Mr Willis had lost sight of condition 3.  Little is known of Mr Willis from the
evidence
but Exhibit 1, the only evidence tendered by the vendor, is a very
sparse statement by Mr Willis to Penrith City Council dated 28
July 1998 by
which he confirmed that he was the original applicant for an extension and that
he assigned his rights in the application
and the property to the vendor.  (Mr
Willis does not state any facts which establish why he applied for an extension
or how he was
qualified to do so, remembering that under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s99.html" class="autolink_findacts">subsection 99</a> (4B) the
persons authorised to apply for an extension are <i>"The applicant or any other
person entitled to act on the consent"</i>;  the applicant was Building
Environments Pty Limited and I am left to suppose that Mr Willis was in some
way acting on behalf of
the applicant, or of the vendor, or of some
intermediate owner.)  Presumably Mr Willis' application prompted the Council's
letter
of 3 November 1995 which I set out earlier.  Council took no further
action on the application until June 1998.
<P>

20	A letter of 17 June 1998 (Exhibit B62) from the vendor's solicitors to the
Council referred to the Council's letter to Mr Willis
of 3 November 1995 and
called on the Council to determine the extension application and notify its
decision.  The purchaser's solicitors
by letter contended that the Council
should not do so, but Council again took the application under consideration
(Exhibit B73) and
on 20 July 1998 resolved to extend the consent for a twelve
month period;  Council's letter dated 22 July 1998 notifying this decision
(Exhibit B77) said (correctly) <i>"The consent shall now lapse twelve months
from the date of this letter."</i>  (It is interesting that Mr Willis'
statement to the Council explaining his position was later in date than the
Council's decision.)
<P>

21	Mr Brischetto came to know the true position about the development consent
having lapsed as a result of inquiries which he made
of Penrith City Council.
The purchaser obtained a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> certificate for itself from the Penrith City
Council and that certificate dated 23 March 1998 (Exhibit A51) contained
exactly the
same statement about the development consent as the certificate
annexed to the Contract for Sale of Land.  The vendor gave Notice
to Complete
dated 23 April 1998 (B38) requiring settlement by 11 May.  In some way an
inquiry which Mr Brischetto made at the office
of Penrith City Council directed
the attention of its officers to the true position;  on 24 April 1998 Mr
Britten, the Council's
legal officer told him that Council had reviewed its
file and taken legal advice, and that the consent had lapsed.  Mr Brischetto
made some observations which show how surprising this was to him;  later that
day he contended in a telephone conversation with Mr
Britten that the Council
was bound to hold to the position in its letter of 3 November 1995, and Mr
Britten did not accept that this
was so.  On 27 April 1998 the purchaser by
letter asked the Council to state the grounds for its decision that the
development approval
was no longer valid.  Mr Britten replied on 29 April 1998
by letter stating the position in a considered way.
<P>

22	The Notice of Rescission was delivered a few days later on 5 May and stated
grounds, referring to the statement in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> certificate which formed part
of the Contract, Penrith City Council's advice that DA 234/93 had lapsed and
asserting that the Contract
contained a misrepresentation or alternatively a
misdescription in a material respect and that the purchaser had relied on the
misrepresentation
or misdescription.  It also asserted that it was a condition
of the Contract that development consent was current and that there
was a
breach of the condition giving rise to an entitlement to rescind.  After the
Notice of Rescission was delivered the parties
adopted contentious positions
expressed in their solicitors' correspondence.
<P>

23	On behalf of the vendor counsel submitted that the statement relating to the
development consent in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> certificate forming part of the Contract for
Sale was correct.  This remarkable contention was based on the historical truth
that
the development consent had indeed been granted;  it had been granted some
years earlier and there was no express statement in the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> certificate about
whether it was still in effect or had lapsed.  However if the statement did not
convey the meaning that the development
consent had effect it is not possible
to understand why it appeared in the certificate or why it appeared in a
document forming part
of the Contract for Sale of Land.  A statement in a
document forming part of a Contract made on 11 March 1998 about a development
consent which had lapsed on 28 October 1995 could have no possible purpose and
have no possible function except to mislead the reader.
 It is in the nature of
advice included in a planning certificate under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">subsection 149</a> (5) that the
advice is on relevant matters affecting the land of which the Council is aware.
No reasonable reader would suppose that
a statement of relevant matters
affecting the land would include a reference to a development consent which had
once had a life of
two years but had elapsed two and half years ago;  that
could not be relevant to a certificate and could not affect the land and
no
reasonable people would think it did.  When the statement in the certificate is
taken in the context of the whole of the Contract
of which it formed part,
bearing in mind the nature of the Contract and the transaction which it
effected, it was a clear and unmistakable
representation that the development
consent still had effect.  The warranties in special condition 39 are an
important part of the
context in which the reference to the development
application in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s149.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 149</a> certificate bears this meaning.
<P>

24	The character of the statement in the certificate as a misrepresentation is
clear enough if attention is confined to the terms
of the Contract for the Sale
of Land but becomes far clearer if attention is also directed to the context of
the dealings between
Mr Brischetto and the agent conducting the vendor's
business;  those dealings included the terms of the advertisement and the
documents
which the agent had shown to Mr Brischetto, including the approved
plans and the Council's letter assuring validity.  Resort to these
surrounding
circumstances is obviously appropriate for the purpose of understanding what
the Contract represented to the purchaser,
and is not restricted by the special
condition or other terms of the Contract for Sale itself.  There was no
condition such as was
referred to in the Notice of Rescission, and the
purchaser does not and cannot assert that there has been any warranty or
Contractual
condition such as is referred to in special condition 31.
<P>

25	Counsel for the vendor made submissions to the effect that a close and
legally informed consideration of the terms of Council's
letter of 3 November
1995 would have shown that the burden of the letter could not be correct.  The
reasons for this are that the
amendment to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s99.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 99</a> which took effect on 1 July
1993 happened earlier than the consent of 29 October 1993, so that the reason
given for the development
consent becoming valid for five years cannot be
correct.  Counsel also observed that the fact that there had been an
application
for an extension itself showed that there must have been a
condition shortening the period of five years, having regard to the state
which
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s99.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 99</a> had assumed by 29 October 1993.  I see that a very insightful person with
an extremely close understanding of the workings of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s99.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 99</a> might have, on
reflection, developed some doubts about the information furnished by the
letter, but the ordinary reasonable reader
would not, Mr Brischetto as a matter
of fact did not, the Council officers accepted the position, it would seem for
several years,
and it is improbable that the vendor saw through the letter,
because if it had it is unlikely that the property would have been marketed
in
the way it was.
<P>

26	The purchaser's counsel contended that the purchaser was entitled to rescind
on the <i>Flight v Booth</i> principle.  That principle relates to errors or
misdescriptions which are such that a decree for specific performance against
the
purchaser would be refused;  the circumstances where an error or
misdescription would lead to such refusal can vary very widely and
cannot be
gathered into clear categories, essentially because of the discretionary nature
of specific performance and because of
Equity's concern to enforce Contracts
for Sale of Land according to their substance, involving a need to address the
facts of each
case and judge the substance.
<P>

27	If there was a material misrepresentation which induced the purchaser to
enter into the Contract, it is not necessary that the
representation should
have had contractual force if it is to warrant rescission.  <i>Flight v
Booth</i> (1834) 1 Binghams New Cases 370 is referred to to identify cases, not
necessarily closely related to any holding in that case, where
a purchaser can
resist specific performance of an agreement for purchase of land where the
property to be conveyed on completion
is substantially different from what the
purchaser contracted to buy.  At Common Law a purchaser was not obliged to
complete if there
was any difference, whether substantial or not, so the
subject relates to a qualification of a qualification which Equity placed
on
the contractual obligation.  See discussion in Professor Butts' <i>The Standard
Contract for Sale in New South Wales </i>2nd edition paragraph [6.51].  In<i>
Batey v Gifford</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%20710" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 710</a> Handley JA considered and applied this
qualification;  see 716C and following.
<P>

28	Cases in which <i>Flight v Booth</i> has been invoked have recurringly been
cases where the vendor could not make title to land of the dimensions described
or to all
of the parcels described.  Problems of these kind are not often
encountered for land under the Torrens System.  However there is
no restriction
of the kind of problems to which <i>Flight v Booth</i> can relate to problems
of title.
<P>

29	There is no doubt that the misrepresentation or misdescription related to a
matter of substance;  the existence of development
consent led the purchaser to
be interested in the property, and was the prominent feature of the vendor's
marketing.  There is substantial
difference between land with development
potential without any available development consent and the same land with a
development
consent, building approval and plans ready to start work.  There is
no less a substantial difference if prospects exist of getting
back an earlier
advantage of a development consent by making another application or pursuing a
long-standing application for an extension;
 one situation is certain and the
other is contingent.  What Mr Britten told Mr Brischetto on 28 April was
completely correct;  it
was a statement about an objective fact, not about a
decision that the Council had made or would make.  There was no analogy with
the situation in which information about what Council would do was communicated
in <i>Glennon v Sullivan</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20NSW%20Conv%20R%2055%2d253" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) NSW Conv R 55-253</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/79.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 79</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=61%20ALJR%2063" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">61 ALJR 63.</a>
<P>

30	When the Notice of Rescission was given the vendor had issued a Notice to
Complete and was maintaining the position that time
would become of the essence
and the purchaser would be in default and liable to a decree for specific
performance in a few more days,
yet had brought about the Contract by an
important misrepresentation, quite untrue, manifestly so and one which it had
taken no step
to make good.  Although it was thus precipitating a crisis in a
situation in which it did not have any merits, its counsel contended
that it
was then entitled to specific performance and pointed to the fact that some
months later it obtained an extension of the
consent.
<P>

31	The vendor's counsel contended that the fact that the extension was in fact
granted proves that the application was one which
was bound to be determined by
way of approval.  This contention was manifestly groundless, and was not an
appropriate use  of the
opportunity furnished to counsel to make
submissions.
<P>

32	In these circumstances the purchaser had, in my opinion, a very strong
claim, indeed an unanswerable claim to rescission of the
agreement by decree in
Equity at the time when it delivered its Notice of Rescission.
<P>

33	If the purchaser had at that time brought proceedings claiming an order of
the Court rescinding the Contract for Sale of Land,
or if the vendor had
brought proceedings for specific performance and the proceedings had been heard
in the state of facts which
then existed there could be no doubt of the
outcome.  The only matter for debate arose out of the decision which Council
made on
20 July and notified on 22 July to grant an extension.  If the
hypothetical proceedings I have referred to were heard after that
happened the
fact that an extension had been granted would have to be considered, but it
would be no more than a discretionary consideration.
 The fact that an
extension was obtained in July made it no less true that the Contract with an
agreed completion date in April was
induced by misrepresentation and contained
a misdescription in March and was liable to be rescinded in May;  an extension
granted
in July did not mean that the property had development consent on the
contracted date for completion in April or in the interim,
or that if the
purchaser had it completed about 22 April would have been able to carry out the
purpose for which it purchased the
property.  Mr Brischetto's evidence
establishes that the purpose of acquiring the property was related to obtaining
a development
project on which to work at a particular time, and that the
opportunity passed and was no longer useful.  The grant of an extension
from 20
July 1998 to 19 July 1999 gave emphasis to the earlier want of compliance, but
the agreement was no less based on misrepresentation
and misdescription than it
had ever been.  The vendor's counsel suggested that in some way the grant of
the extension had retrospective
effect and meant that the development consent
was in effect throughout the interim or hiatus between 29 October 1993 and 19
July
1998.  In my opinion there is no basis for this and indeed the terms of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s99.html" class="autolink_findacts">subsection 99</a> (4E) clearly demonstrate that it is wrong, as the date from which
the extension commences to run is clearly prescribed.
<P>

34	Whether the extension when granted was effective would appear to depend,
potentially or actually, on whether the person who made
the application for
extension was qualified to do so.  The vendor, who was maintaining that there
had been an effective extension
and that that fact enabled it to answer
purchaser's case, and which was in a position to adduce evidence showing
whether or not the
applicant was so entitled, did not lead any evidence on the
subject.
<P>

35	In my opinion the purchaser's claim for rescission was so strong that, in
the absence of any showing by the vendor that it had
any discretionary
considerations or other matter of defence to put against the claim, the Notice
of Rescission should be treated
in Equity as having taken effect on 5 May 1998.
Even if this were not correct the strength of the purchaser's claim for a
discretionary
decision relieving it from forfeiture of its deposit and other
liabilities is overwhelmingly strong, as it was led by the vendor
into buying
the property on a completely false basis, although on the true basis the
property did not fit into the purchaser's business
requirements.  Although the
vendor was in a position to revive the long-pending application and direct
Council's attention to it,
it did not do so at the time when currency of the
development consent was important, did so only after it had taken up a position
of contention after the Notice of Rescission, and did not succeed in obtaining
an extension until three months later than the time
for completion to which it
had agreed.  The vendor showed extreme hardihood in resisting the purchaser's
claim for the return of
its deposit, and is fortunate that the purchaser, which
has been caused a great deal of trouble expense and uncertainty, has claimed
no
more than the return of its deposit.
<P>

36	Counsel sought to uphold the vendor's position by maintaining the untenable,
and the vendor endeavoured with inappropriate tenacity
to retain control over
the deposit to which the purchaser was plainly entitled.
<P>

37	ORDERS:
