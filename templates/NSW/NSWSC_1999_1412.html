<center><b>JUDGMENT</b><p>
<b></center><u></u></b><p>
<b><u><center></u>PRIESTLEY JA:</b> <p>
<u>Introduction</u>.<p>
	On 20 June 1996 a District Court jury found Mr Salvatore Mammone guilty of
having between 1 June 1991 and 18 December 1991 knowingly
taken part, at Appin,
in the cultivation of the prohibited plant cannabis in not less than the large
commercial quantity applicable
to prohibited plants. The trial judge, his
Honour Judge Kinchington QC, convicted Mr Mammone and on 19 August 1996
sentenced him
to a minimum term of imprisonment of three and a half years
commencing on 20 June 1996 and expiring on 19 December 1999, and an additional
term of fourteen months imprisonment.<p>
	Mr Mammone appealed against his conviction and sought leave to appeal against
his sentence.<p>
	The cannabis was cultivated on a property known as Lot 1, Appin Road (which I
will call the property).<p>
	Some time shortly after 7 pm on 17 December 1991 there was an explosion and a
fire on the property. According to evidence given
at the trial by Mr E.
Firlayis, he returned to Australia from overseas on 2 December 1991 and before
17 December visited the property
in order to see  members of his family then
living there. His three brothers were then at the property. One of these was
badly burnt
in the fire on 17 December 1991.<p>
	Immediately after the fire police officers went to the property and found that
more than 1,000 cannabis plants had been grown there
and that immediately
before the explosion and the considerable fire which followed there had
apparently been an attempt to burn much
of the cannabis which at that time
remained on the property. <p>
	Mr E. Firlayis also gave evidence that one of his brothers, Ali, served two
and a half years gaol for having grown the marijuana
on the property, Kemal
(the one who was burnt) was sentenced to 500 community hours, and the remaining
brother, Unal, was given a
bond.<p>
	The fact that the three Firlayis brothers were engaged in the cultivation of
cannabis at the property between the dates in respect
of which the appellant
was also charged was not disputed at the appellant's trial. Nor was it disputed
that the quantity cultivated
was not less than the large commercial quantity
applicable to prohibited plants.<p>
	<u>The principal issue at the trial</u>. As the trial unfolded, the
substantial matter the prosecution had to prove beyond reasonable doubt was
that the appellant had knowingly
taken part in the undisputed cultivation of
the cannabis. There was no direct evidence of this. The prosecution relied upon
a circumstantial
case. <p>
	The issue of the appellant's knowledge was further narrowed by the stance he
took at the trial. In an unsworn statement to the jury
he said that he had met
Ali Firlayis (whom he knew as Michael Finlay) early in 1991 and had come to an
arrangement with him that
he (Mr Firlayis) would cultivate the property at Lot
1 Appin Road as a market garden and supply the appellant's restaurant at
Campbelltown
with vegetables from it free of charge in return for the help the
appellant would give to Mr Firlayis in establishing what the appellant
described as "<i>a legitimate business farm</i>"<i>. </i> <p>
</center><u>What the appellant said about the principal issue</u>. In his
unsworn statement, the appellant acknowledged that he had done a number of
things in helping Mr Firlayis establish the farm
and had often visited the
property. He said that all of his actions and his visits were connected with
the arrangement he had made
with Mr Firlayis to help him in the establishment
of the legitimate vegetable farm, as they had agreed. He said he had not known
of the cannabis cultivation until the night of 17 December 1991; Mr Ali
Firlayis then came to his restaurant and asked him to go
to the hospital with
him; Mr Firlayis then said to him "<i>We were growing marijuana on the
property</i>"; the appellant said he had replied "<i>How can you do that to
me</i>?" and added the comment that he said this<p>
"<i>because the first thing that went through my mind was all the things that I
have done for them and everything was related to me because
everywhere that I
went everyone knew that I wanted these particular things for Appin, that
everyone knew that this was what I was
doing.</i>"<p>
<p>
<u>The appeal against conviction</u>.<p>
In the appeal against conviction, counsel for the appellant relied on two
grounds. The first was that the jury's verdict was unsafe
and unsatisfactory
and the second that certain evidence had been wrongly admitted and was
prejudicial to the appellant. I do not
think the evidence was wrongly admitted
and in dealing first with the unsafe and unsatisfactory ground I will mention
that evidence
on the basis that it was properly before the jury. I will explain
the reasons for my opinion about the evidence after I have dealt
with the
unsafe and unsatisfactory ground.<p>
	<u>The unsafe and unsatisfactory ground</u>. This ground succeeds in cases
where a Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that a reasonable jury, properly
instructed, ought not
to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the
guilt of the appellant: <i>Chamberlain v The Queen (No 2)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20153%20CLR%20521" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 153 CLR
521</a>, <i>Morris v The Queen</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20163%20CLR%2054" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 163 CLR 54.</a> Whether the court is so
satisfied depends upon an independent assessment by the court of the evidence
which was before the jury:
<i>Chamberlain</i> at 534, <i>Morris</i> at 463,
<i>Chidiac v The Queen</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20171%20CLR%20432" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 171 CLR 432</a> at 443, 4542 and 461. The court's
assessment must be of the nature, quality, reliability and credibility of the
evidence: <i>Morris</i> at 461 and 473, <i>Chidiac</i> at 443 and 461. In its
assessment of the evidence, the court is not to usurp the function of the jury
and disturb a verdict merely
because it disagrees with the jury's conclusion:
<i>Chamberlain</i> at 534, <i>Morris</i> at 462: and must also bear in mind the
advantage of the jury in hearing and seeing the witnesses: <i>Chidiac</i> at
462. In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be one which
a jury should have experienced: <i>M v The Queen</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20487" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 487</a> at 494.
In some cases the advantage which the jury had in seeing and hearing the
evidence will resolve a doubt experienced by an
appellate court, but except in
such cases it will usually be the appellate court's duty to conclude that the
doubt it has is one
which a reasonable jury ought also to have had: <i>M v The
Queen</i> at 494. The ultimate question is always whether the court thinks on
the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied
beyond
reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty: <i>M v The Queen</i> at 495.<p>
	At pp 18 to 22 of the transcript of 12 June 1996 of the trial judge's
summing-up, he listed the principal circumstances relied upon
by the Crown as
pointing to the appellant having taken part in the cultivation of the cannabis
at the property. These were:<p>
*	his principal role in arranging for the property to be leased to Michael
Finlay and his wife for a term of twelve months beginning
on 1 June 1991, at a
rent of $1,170 per month, with the requirements of a rental bond of $1,080 and
with a continuation clause providing
that at the end of the term the tenant
could stay in the residential premises at the same rent or one increased in
accordance with
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/" class="autolink_findacts">Residential Tenancies Act 1987</a> unless or until the
agreement was ended in accordance with that Act;<p>
*	the borrowing of a tractor in May or June 1991 for the purpose of ploughing
up the land;<p>
*	his hiring of equipment from various hirers in July and August 1991 for use
in preparation of the land on the property; his ordering
of and payment for
concrete which was used for the footings in which five greenhouses (for which
$63,000 was paid in cash) were secured.
(The cannabis was subsequently grown in
four of these five greenhouses.)<p>
*	that in August 1991 he was with one of the Firlayis brothers when some of the
hired equipment already mentioned was picked up;<p>
*	his regular visits to the property; <p>
*	the finding in the appellant's possession of three custom made metal boxes
identical to a fourth custom made metal box found on
the property;<p>
*	the appellant's admission (made formally in the course of the trial) that on
15 November 1991 in the company of another male he
had gone to the premises of
Mr Parsons to pick up a number of polyurethane boxes of the same kind as white
boxes found on the property
on 18 December 1991 or shortly afterwards, in some
of which traces of cannabis were found;<p>
*	that no punnets of the kind usual in commercial marketing of small cocktail
tomatoes (which the appellant had said he understood
were being grown) were
found on the property;<p>
*	the part played by the appellant in the obtaining of the tenancy of a
property at Wedderburn by Mr Firlayis in which cannabis was
found;<p>
*	the fact that, on the evidence, the Firlayis brothers had no funds;<p>
*	the use by the Firlayis brothers of a station sedan RZI-481 which the
appellant had purchased from his brother-in-law on 9 October
1991;<p>
*	the association between the appellant and at least one of the Firlayis
brothers in the latter part of 1991 when the Wedderburn
lease was negotiated;<p>
*	the going to the hospital to visit the injured Firlayis brother on the night
of the fire;<p>
*	the appellant's presence with one of the Firlayis brothers at one of the
hiring companies in September 1991;<p>
*	the use by the Firlayis brothers of the appellant's mobile phone number and
his restaurant phone number as reference points for
tradespeople or others
dealing with them in regard to the purchase or hire of items used on the
property;<p>
*	the lack of any documentation showing the existence of any legitimate
business relationship between the Firlayis brothers and the
appellant; <p>
*	the appellant's urgent need for large sums of money during 1991;<p>
*	the fact that when Detective Walsh, after the fire and the discovery of the
cannabis, asked the appellant about his association
with the Firlayis brothers,
he said that he only introduced him to the agents for the lessors, an
understatement of the true position
so great as to be without doubt a lie, as
the appellant recognised in his unsworn statement at the trial.<p>
	The foregoing circumstances seem to me to make a strong circumstantial case.
They might, just barely, support the contention made
for the appellant at the
trial and again in the appeal that although they show a very close association
with the Firlayis brothers
and their activities on the property, they do not
exclude the possible hypothesis that the appellant believed, as he later
claimed,
that all the activities were legitimate market gardening activities
and that he neither knew of nor had any part in the activity
of cultivating the
cannabis. For myself, I would think that, if it were necessary to decide on the
circumstances already set out,
taking them together with what flows from the
rejection by the jury of the appellant's unsworn statement, they were
sufficient to
enable the jury reasonably to come to the conclusions that no
hypothesis consistent with the appellant's explanation was reasonably
open and
that they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had
knowingly taken part in the cultivation. When however
some of the items already
mentioned are looked at in more detail and a matter not yet mentioned is taken
into account, it seems to
me that it would have been quite unreasonable for the
jury to have thought any hypothesis was available consistent with the
appellant's
innocence.<p>
	In the course of their investigations police officers stopped the appellant
while driving a red motor vehicle RVQ-846. On this occasion
the police took
possession of two of the four custom made metal boxes already referred to. They
also found in the console of the
motor vehicle a bundle of documents, which
became Exhibit ABF at the trial. Nothing is known about these documents apart
from what
can be seen from them themselves and the fact that they were found in
the appellant's possession. In his unsworn statement he made
a slight reference
to them which the jury were at liberty to (and obviously did) reject. The
reference in any event did not explain
them in any informative way. One of the
documents was a receipt from the estate agent to whom the rent of the Appin
property was
paid, for the payment of $1,170 rent for the period from 1
November 1991 to 1 December 1991. It was dated 7 November 1991. The documents
also included two Telecom phone bills. Each had been paid on 7 November 1991,
the receipt stamp on each of Postal Services Campbelltown
New South Wales being
virtually identical. One account was in the appellant's name and the other in
the name of Mr Michael Finlay.
Another document was an account from one of the
hiring companies for the hire of equipment used on the Appin property, the
account
being in the appellant's name and the statement date being 31 October
1991. Another document was a handwritten list of items under
the heading "Sam",
a name by which the appellant was usually known, a number of which items are
identifiable as equipment used on
the property for which the appellant paid.
There are five items titled "Glasshouses" each for substantial amounts. Other
sheets in
the bundle had other names at the top also showing items and amounts
referable to equipment used and money otherwise spent on the
property. In the
absence of any explanation from the appellant of the contents of these
documents they certainly left open the reasonable
inference that they were
records of the contributions made by a number of different parties (including
the appellant) to the cost
of what was being done on the Appin property. They
also support the inference that what was being done on the property was being
done at very considerable expense. On one of the sheets under the heading "Sam"
appears the item "Telecom" against an amount "389.29".
The amount of the
Telecom account in the name of Mr Michael Finlay already referred to as having
been paid on 7 November 1991 at
the same time as an account addressed to the
appellant, was $388.29.<p>
	The appellant was of course not obliged to explain the documents; but, looked
at simply as documents, in the light of the other
facts incontestably known
about what was happening on the Appin property, it seems to me it was fairly
open to the jury to draw inferences
from them of the kind I have, by no means
exhaustively, indicated.<p>
	The jury were not obliged to accept what the appellant said in his unsworn
statement; it is apparent from their verdict that they
did not. Once they came
to the conclusion, as they were reasonably entitled to do, that the appellant
was not telling the truth,
they were entitled to take that fact (not telling
the truth) as one of the circumstances to be considered in deciding whether the
hypothesis of the appellant's innocent connection with the property was one
reasonably open. It seems to me that this feature of
the case, in combination
both with the undisputed facts and also the possession by the appellant,
without plausible explanation,
of documents linking him with a cooperative
venture on the property much more consistent with the growing of cannabis than
humbler
and less remunerative vegetables, furnished a proper and persuasive
basis for the jury's having concluded that it was beyond reasonable
doubt that
the appellant had participated in the cultivation of the cannabis.<p>
<u>The evidence ground</u>. One of the matters listed by the trial judge
amongst the principal circumstances relied upon by the Crown was the part
played by
the appellant in the obtaining of the tenancy of the property at
Wedderburn by Mr Firlayis. It was not disputed that on 7 January
1992 police
officers went to the Wedderburn property and found that a substantial marijuana
packaging operation was in progress there.
The submission for the appellant was
that it was wrong for the trial judge "<i>to admit evidence of the activities
conducted by the Firlayis brothers</i>" at the property. <p>
	The main points pertaining to the relevance of this evidence were the
following facts proved at the trial: the purchase by the appellant
on 9 October
1991 of the station sedan RZI-481, subsequently used by the Firlayis brothers
on the Appin property; the picking up
by the appellant in the company of
another male of white polyurethane boxes, on 15 November 1991 from Mr Parsons
and the taking them
away in the station sedan RZI-481; the obtaining of a
tenancy of Lot 8, Wedderburn Road, Wedderburn, some time during November 1991
by Mr A. Firlayis in the name of Watt; the active involvement of the appellant
in the deception of the estate agent as to the tenant's
name at the time when
the tenancy was being obtained; the finding of traces of cannabis in the
station sedan RZI-481 on 17 December
1991; the finding of cannabis at the
Wedderburn property on 7 January 1992 and the finding at those premises at that
time of a polyurethane
box identified by Mr Parsons as being of the kind he had
sold to the appellant on 9 October 1991.<p>
	It seems to me that this material is all relevant to the issue whether the
association of the appellant with the Firlayis brothers
at the Appin property
was consistent with his not having knowingly taken part in the cultivation of
cannabis on that property. On
the evidence the jury were entitled to conclude
that marijuana was being grown on the Appin property in November, it was being
packaged
on the Wedderburn property in early January, the appellant in November
told lies to help the Firlayis brothers get the Wedderburn
tenancy and there
was a polyurethane box of the same kind as the appellant had picked up in
company with a male in a car he made
available to the Firlayis brothers and as
were later found at the Appin property, connected with cannabis and as found at
the Wedderburn
property. Parts of this evidence may not have been strong, but
all seem to me to have been relevant to the question of the degree
of
association between the appellant and the Firlayis brothers in regard to
marijuana growing and to the question whether it could
reasonably be supposed
that the appellant's knowledge and activities relating to the Appin property
did not include participation
in the growing of the cannabis. <p>
	In my opinion the admissibility objection fails.<p>
<u>Conclusion</u>.<p>
	I do not think either of the two grounds relied on by the appellant should
succeed.<p>
	Although in the Notice of Appeal leave was sought to appeal against sentence,
my understanding is that the proceedings were conducted
as an appeal against
conviction. The only order I propose therefore is that the appeal against
conviction be dismissed.<p>
