STUDDERT J
<P>

Friday 1 October 1999
<P>

10771/99	<b>GANGEMI HOLDINGS PTY LIMITED   v   MAXWELL JOHN SALTER &amp; 2
ORS</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1  	STUDDERT J:  The plaintiff, Gangemi Holdings Pty Limited, has
appealed by summons to this Court from a decision of the Local
Court at Cowra
and seeks in the summons the following orders:
<P>

<i>"1.	An order setting aside the findings, order, verdict and judgment of
Magistrate A. O'Donohue dated 8 March, 1999 in Cowra Local
Court proceedings
96/96 between the parties hereto.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	An order that verdict and judgment be entered in favour of the Plaintiff
in these proceedings, Gangemi Holdings Pty Ltd.</i>
<P>

<i>3.	Such further order(s) as the Court deems appropriate.</i>
<P>

<i>4.	Costs."</i>
<P>

2  	Under s 69 of the <i>Local Courts (Civil Claims) Act</i> all
judgments of a Local Court exercising jurisdiction under that Act are to be
<i>"final and conclusive"</i>.  However s 69(2) provides for a limited right of
appeal:
<P>

<i>"(2)	A party to proceedings under this Act who is dissatisfied with the
judgment or order of the court as being erroneous in point
of law, may appeal
to the Supreme Court therefrom."</i>
<P>

3  	Before considering the various grounds of appeal raised by the
plaintiff, it is desirable to record an outline as to the nature
of the
proceedings in the Local Court.
<P>

4  	Maxwell John Salter and Jennifer Susan Salter (the first and the
second defendants named in the summons in this Court) took
proceedings in the
Local Court against Gangemi Holdings Pty Limited (the plaintiff in this Court)
claiming damages for breach of
an alleged contract of employment.  Charles
Davison (the third defendant named in the summons) was joined as a third party
in the
Local Court, and the company claimed <i>"contribution towards or
indemnity for any judgment recovered against it"</i> in the action.
<P>

5  	The Local Court action succeeded and a judgment was entered
against the company for the amount claimed, namely $27,613.  The
third party
claim failed.  Hence the present summons.
<P>

6  	By way of background, the plaintiff company owned and operated a
rural property known as "Newry Downs" at Lyndhurst and it employed
the third
defendant as its manager.  The first and the second defendants alleged that the
third defendant, acting on the plaintiff's
behalf, engaged them to work at
Newry Downs at a combined weekly wage of $780 gross.  It was further alleged
that the defendants
were to be provided with a four wheel drive vehicle for
work and personal use, fuel provided, and that they were also to be provided
with accommodation.  It was alleged that the contract was to be for a term of
not less than two years.
<P>

7  	The plaintiff denied that the third defendant had authority to
employ the first and the second defendants on the terms alleged,
although it
was not disputed that those defendants did take up employment at Newry Downs on
1 February 1996, occupying premises the
lease of which was arranged by the
third defendant.  The third defendant instructed the agent to arrange a lease
for twelve months
from 1 February 1996 with an option for a further twelve
months.  In preparing the lease the agent omitted to include the option,
although the lessor had agreed to it.  However nothing turns on this
omission.
<P>

8  	After the third defendant was admitted to hospital in April 1996
for a mental illness, the plaintiff informed the first and
the second
defendants that there was available to them only two months casual work.  The
first and the second defendants thereupon
consulted their solicitors and looked
elsewhere for employment.  The damages sought in the action thereafter
commenced, and in due
course recovered, represented the difference between the
overall value of the alleged employment terms negotiated with the third
defendant, as calculated over a two year term, and the earnings of the first
and the second defendants in alternative employment
calculated over the same
period.
<P>

9  	The plaintiff resisted the claim of the first and the second
defendants, denying the authority of the third defendant to enter
into the
agreement on its behalf.  In addition, by its third party claim, it sought to
recover from the third defendant any damages
awarded against the plaintiff,
should they succeed in their claim against it.
<P>

<b>The grounds of appeal</b>
<P>

10  	The plaintiff relies upon a number of grounds of appeal which
purport to identify errors of law.  I propose to consider these
grounds in the
order in which they have been expressed and argued.
<P>

<b>Ground (a):	The learned magistrate erred in law in finding that there was a
valid and binding contract between the plaintiff and the
first and the second
defendants</b>
<P>

11  	In considering this ground it is desirable to identify the
relevant findings expressed in the reasons for judgment of the learned
magistrate.  Having considered those reasons, it is clear that the magistrate
did determine that the third defendant engaged the
services of the first and
the second defendants on the terms they alleged and as agent for the plaintiff.
At p 7 the magistrate said:
<P>

<i>"I reject any notion that the agreement is one between the third party [that
is, the third defendant] and the plaintiffs [the first
and the second
defendants] or that it is void for uncertainty.  I am satisfied that in its
terms the contract of employment is clear
and unequivocal.  It was for the
employment of both plaintiffs [the first and the second defendants].</i>
<P>

<i>I find as a fact that the third party was acting as an employee and agent of
the defendant company..."</i>
<P>

12  	Then later at p 8, the magistrate added:
<P>

<i>"Mr Davison was not employed as a farm hand or as a rouseabout but as a
manager with the obvious confidence of Dr Gangemi.  He was
required to run the
rural operations of the company.  That extended to employing people.  I am not
satisfied that his illness affected
his decision-making process to the extent
that at the time he contracted with the Salters on behalf of the company he was
acting
other than in his capacity as manager.  It follows that he did not act
in excess of the authority the company had delegated to him."</i>
<P>

13  	As observed at the outset, the nature of this appeal is a
limited one.  The plaintiff can only succeed by establishing error
of law in
the court below.  In considering this appeal the principles defining what
constitutes a question of law as expressed by
Jordan CJ in <i>Australian Gas
Light Company v The Valuer General</i> (1940) 40 SR 126 at 137-138 are in
point.
<P>

14  	From the passages of the judgment to which I have already
referred, it is clear that the magistrate made a finding that the
third
defendant engaged the services of the first and the second defendants on behalf
of the plaintiff and that in so doing he was
acting within his authority as the
plaintiff's manager.
<P>

15  	This was a finding of fact which cannot be disturbed unless
there was no evidence capable of supporting it.  The finding cannot
be
disturbed upon the basis that the finding was against the weight of the
evidence:  see <i>Poricanin v Australian Consolidated Industries</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%202%20NSWLR%20419" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 2
NSWLR 419</a>; <i>Azzopardi v Tasman UEB Industries Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%204%20NSWLR%20139" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 4 NSWLR 139</a>;
and <i>Haines v Leves</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20442" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 442.</a>
<P>

16  	<i>Azzopardi</i> involved an appeal from the then Workers
Compensation Commission at a time when an appeal lay to the Court of Appeal
only to correct
errors of law.  In emphasising the limited nature of the appeal
Glass JA, with whose judgment Samuels JA agreed, said at 155-156:
<P>

<i>"To say of a finding that it is perverse, that it is contrary to the
overwhelming weight of the evidence, that it is against the evidence
and the
weight of the evidence, that it ignores the probative force of the evidence
which is all one way or that no reasonable person
could have made it, is to say
the same thing in different ways.  Upon proof that the finding of a jury is
vitiated in this way, it
will be set aside because it is wrong in fact.  Since
the Act does not allow this Court to correct errors of fact, any argument that
the findings of a Workers' Compensation Commission judge is vitiated in the
same way discloses no error of law and will not constitute
a valid ground of
appeal."</i>
<P>

17  	Those remarks of Glass JA are apposite in an appeal such as the
present one from a decision of a Local Court.
<P>

18  	Whilst Mr Berry has taken the Court to evidence which was
capable of supporting a finding that the third defendant had no authority
to
engage the first and the second defendants on the terms on which he did, it
cannot be said that there was no evidence to support
the findings which the
magistrate here made.  The third defendant was, according to the plaintiff,
employed at "Newry Downs" as a
"Hands on" Manager (Exhibit 8) and there was to
be considered the evidence of the third defendant himself based upon his
statement
tendered as Exhibit 13.  In that document is to be found what I would
regard as the high water mark of the first and the second defendant's
case as
to the terms of the third defendant's authority.  I refer in particular to the
following paragraphs:
<P>

<i>"13.	During my time as farm manager at `Newry Downs' [and earlier he stated
he commenced his employment there in mid February 1995]
I organised employment,
after consultation with Dr Gangemi regarding jobs that were required to be done
on the property.</i>
<P>

<i>14.	In or about October 1995 at `Newry Downs' I recall a meeting I had with
Dr Gangemi who said to me words to the effect:-</i>
<P>

<i>	`Charles you should be able to organise employees for the jobs that need
doing.  You don't tell me how to practise medicine and I
don't tell you how to
run the farm'.</i>
<P>

<i>15.	I would consult with Dr Gangemi about the general direction he had in
mind for the property along with what I thought were best
management practises
and we would reach an agreement.</i>
<P>

<i>16.	I recall commencing and terminating the employment of the following
persons:-</i>
<P>

<i>	<b>Employee				Nature of employment</b></i>
<P>

<i>	John Wythes				Sheep husbandry</i>
<P>

<i>	John Brogan				Cattle pregnancy testing</i>
<P>

<i>	Andy Duggan (Mr Duggan		Shearing and crutching</i>
<P>

<i>would bring 8 or 9 men with him </i>
<P>

<i>to shear and crutch)</i>
<P>

<i>	Troy McFawn				Bulldozer operator</i>
<P>

<i>	Michael Fagan			Hay contractor</i>
<P>

<i>	(Mr Fagan brought 4 men)</i>
<P>

<i>	Kelvin McGoven			Nursery attendant</i>
<P>

<i>(including looking after</i>
<P>

<i>	Dr Gangemi's olive grove)</i>
<P>

<i>	Geoffrey Spackman			Farm Hand</i>
<P>

<i>17.	These people were hired and terminated without consultation with Dr
Gangemi in line with my broad management instructions.</i>
<P>

<i>18.	In or about late November 1995 I discussed projects with Dr Gangemi
which included:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	A complete re-fencing of all interior fences</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	A massive lim [sic] program as this had been neglected in previous
years</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	Rebuilding the farm machinery as it had become inadequate or broken
down</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	Rebuilding silos</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	Rebuilding or creating new cattle yards</i>
<P>

<i>(f)	Gravelling all lane ways and roads</i>
<P>

<i>(g)	Repairing floor boards in shearing sheds</i>
<P>

<i>(h)	Rebuilding two bull dozers on the property.</i>
<P>

<i>19.	I recall saying to Dr Gangemi words to the effect:</i>
<P>

<i>	`This is probably a five year program'</i>
<P>

<i>	Dr Gangemi said words to the effect:</i>
<P>

<i>	`I would like it done in two years'</i>
<P>

<i>20.	The two other employees on the property at the time, Les Bolton and Paul
Defina, did not have the skills to undertake the work
efficiently or at
all.</i>
<P>

<i>21.	After further consultation with Dr Gangemi it was agreed that these
projects should be undertaken.  I told Dr Gangemi that I would
require
assistance and that I had worked with Max Salter previously and he would be
perfect to work with me on the projects.</i>
<P>

<i>22.	I recall specifically talking to Dr Gangemi in November 1995 about Max
and Jenny Salter being used in regard to the employment
because of Max's
special skills.  I recall Dr Gangemi saying words to the effect:</i>
<P>

<i>	`If the work has to be done for the long term improvement of the property
then we should employ them'</i>
<P>

<i>23.	I had several conversations with Max about his perspective [sic]
employment, the exact contents of the conversations I do not
recall except that
I do know that I inquired of Max his then current employment arrangement and of
course whether or not he was interested
in moving to Lyndhurst.</i>
<P>

<i>24.	In the first week in January 1996 I arranged for Max and Jenni Salter to
come down to `Newry Downs' to meet Dr Gangemi.</i>
<P>

<i>25.	We met Dr Gangemi one morning at our residential home on `Newry Downs'
and I recall a lengthy discussion between Max Salter, Dr
Gangemi, Jenni Salter
and myself.</i>
<P>

<i>26.	Dr Gangemi inquired of Max directly about his skills and capabilities.
Whilst I heard parts of that conversation I was mainly
talking to Jenny
separately and cannot recall the exact conversation between Dr Gangemi and Max
Salter in detail.</i>
<P>

<i>27.	The meeting finished in the early afternoon and Dr Gangemi left.</i>
<P>

<i>28.	That afternoon, after the meeting, I met with Dr Gangemi in the olive
grove at `Newry Downs' and spoke to him about Max and Jenny
Salter.</i>
<P>

<i>29.	Dr Gangemi said words to the effect:</i>
<P>

<i>	`He (referring to Max Salter) seems like a decent type of person.  If he
has the skills we should get him started on the project'</i>
<P>

<i>30.	I then drafted that employment agreement and forwarded it to Max for his
approval and signature a true copy of which is attached
hereto and marked with
the letter `C'.</i>
<P>

<i>31.	Max and Jennifer Salter started with us in February 1996."</i>
<P>

19  	In his oral evidence the third defendant said he had discussions
with Dr Gangemi (a director of the plaintiff company) to put
the Salters on as
permanent employees in December 1995 and in January 1996.
<P>

20  	The third defendant was tested on his statement in cross
examination, and conceded in cross examination on para 16 thereof
that he was
not exclusively engaged in employing other permanent employees, but he did
remain adamant that he did have discussion
with Dr Gangemi about employing the
first and the second defendants on a permanent basis.
<P>

21  	I accept the submission advanced by Mr Trebeck on behalf of the
first and the second defendants, and supported by Mr Macrossan
on behalf of the
third defendant, that there was evidence capable of supporting the finding made
by the magistrate as to the third
defendant's authority.  It follows, since it
is not for this Court to review any finding of fact open to the magistrate,
that this
first ground of appeal fails.  No relevant error of law has been
established.
<P>

<b>Ground (b):	The learned magistrate erred in law in finding that there was a
valid and binding contract at all, but if there was such
a contract it was only
between the first and second defendants on the one part and the third defendant
on the other part</b>
<P>

22  	In arguing this ground Mr Berry invited consideration of the
writing signed by the first and the second defendants and by the
third
defendant (Annexure A to the affidavit of the first defendant, itself Exhibit
3).  I set the document out in full:
<P>

<i>"4.1.96</i>
<P>

<i>Private and Confidential</i>
<P>

<i>To:	Max and Jenny Salter</i>
<P>

<i>From:	Charles Davison</i>
<P>

<i>Re:	Terms and Conditions of Employment by Gangemi Holdings Pty Ltd and
Charles Davison</i>
<P>

<i>1.	Combined Weekly Gross Wage $780.00 @ $12.00 per hour Gross, paid
fortnightly.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	65 hours per week to reach $780.00</i>
<P>

<i>	Max = $12.00 per hour</i>
<P>

<i>	Jenny = $8.00 per hour</i>
<P>

<i>3.	Employer provides Max with 4WD vehicle for Work and Personal Use and
supplies fuel for Work use.</i>
<P>

<i>4.	Employer provides house at a maximum of $120 per week rent.</i>
<P>

<i>5.	Max and Jenny are responsible for Phone and electricity.  Employer pays
standing charges on phone and electricity.</i>
<P>

<i>6.	Employer pays industry accepted superannuation and Four weeks annual
leave but employer will not pay 17% loading on annual leave.</i>
<P>

<i>7.	Max is responsible to Charles and will be solely involved in farming,
earthmoving and fabrication and servicing of equipment. 
Jenny is responsible
to him and Charles and will be involved with Ostrich Breeding, Seed
Propagation, Earthworm Production and General
Home and House Duties.</i>
<P>

<i>8.	Commencement date 1.2.96.</i>
<P>

<i>The above agreement between Gangemi Holdings Pty Ltd and Charles Davison
(Employer's), Max and Jenny Salter, to be effective from
1st February
1996."</i>
<P>

The document was signed by the third defendant under his description as
"Operations Manager Gangemi Holdings Pty Ltd and Charles
Davison".
<P>

23  	Mr Berry submitted that the above document was void for
uncertainty and could not be enforced, even assuming it could otherwise
be
regarded as affording support for the action by the first and the second
defendants.  That is a separate ground (f), to be addressed
discretely later.
However, assuming it afforded evidence of an agreement entered into by the
first defendant and the second defendant,
Mr Berry submitted that the only
person against whom it could constitute an agreement was the third defendant.
Mr Berry invited attention
to the express inclusion of the third defendant in
the document as a contracting party, and he referred to evidence of alleged
statements
by the first defendant to a number of witnesses as indicating that
defendant's understanding that he was contracting with the third
defendant:
<P>

(i)	According to Mr David Fagan, a vehicle salesman, the first defendant spoke
to him some time after 16 March 1997 and said:  
<P>

<i>"My arrangement with Charles Davison has cost me a great deal of money
because I have moved here from Tamworth.  This is the second
time Charles has
done this to me."</i>
<P>

(ii)	According to Mark Robson, who was employed by the plaintiff at "Newry
Downs" from 26 March 1996, the first defendant said to
him:
<P>

<i>"I am having trouble with my employment agreement with Charles Davison.
Charles has done this sort of thing before to me, you know."</i>
<P>

(iii)	According to Paul Defina, the first defendant said to him, at a time
after the first defendant had started to work at "Newry
Downs":
<P>

<i>"I have a written agreement from Charles containing my job description and
work conditions.  I have been employed by Charles in the
past."</i>
<P>

	And later:
<P>

<i>"I was employed to drive a truck which Charles is to buy and we are going to
transport our own lime, gypsum and grains for this farm
and others.  I have
been offered wages, a house provided and a new utility, so I am doing
well."</i>
<P>

(iv)	According to an investigator, Lesley Foley, the first defendant spoke with
her in December 1996 and told her:
<P>

<i>"...that Charles Davison had offered him full time employment, accommodation
and a new four wheel drive vehicle for his sole use,
he also offered Mrs Salter
part time employment, all of this being drawn up into a contract.  Mr Salter
stated, that when he became
aware that the offers and contracts had been made
by Mr Davison without Dr Gangemi's authority, he felt sorry for the Doctor
.</i>
<P>

<i>However, as Manager of the properties, Charles Davison was representing
Gangemi Holdings and he and his wife had suffered enormous
financial loss by
accepting the contract.</i>
<P>

<i>Further into the conversation, Mr Salter informed me that he had known
Charles Davison for many years and was very aware that he was
unscrupulous, had
ripped off previous employers, was a liar and a con man, and could tell me
things of Charles past that `would make
my hair stand on end' and would be
beneficial in the case Charles was bringing against the Doctor in his Workers'
Compensation claim.
 He further stated, that he had worked with him previously
and had been `ripped off' by Charles.  When I asked why he had agreed
to work
with Charles again given his prior experiences and awareness of Charles's
reputation, Mr Salter informed me, that as the
contract was with Doctor Gangemi
and not Charles himself he did not feel there was any risk."</i>
<P>

24  	The extracts of evidence set out in (i) to (iv) above could not
be regarded as concluding the issue of the liability of the
plaintiff, even if
the learned magistrate accepted that the first defendant said what was
attributed to him.  I note that each of
the statements is claimed to have been
made by the first defendant after the alleged agreement upon which the first
defendant and
the second defendant based their action, but it is also to be
borne in mind that the first defendant did not accept in his evidence
that he
had made any of the statements attributed to him.  The relevant evidence of Mr
Robson, Mr Defina and Ms Foley was denied
(see the transcript of evidence of 21
December 1998 at pp 35, 36, 37 and 38).
<P>

25  	As to the form of the document signed by the three defendants,
it named the plaintiff as a contracting party and the fact that
the third
defendant is also named does not, ipso facto, exonerate the plaintiff from
liability to the first and the second defendants.
 It is well settled that a
named principal is bound by a contract entered into by an agent acting within
the scope of his authority.
 The magistrate was entitled to take into account
the parties named in the document, but what was critical to a determination of
the plaintiff's liability was the issue of the third defendant's authority as
agent.  The magistrate made a specific finding that
there was authority in the
third defendant to bind the plaintiff as considered in Ground (a), and that
finding attracted the plaintiff's
liability.  Since the first and the second
defendants did not sue the third defendant, whether the latter would also have
been liable
for damages by reason of his description in and his execution of
the document did not arise on the cause of action which the first
and the
second defendants brought.
<P>

26  	In my opinion Ground (b) fails.
<P>

<b>Ground (c):	The learned magistrate erred in law in finding that if there was
a valid and binding contract between the first and the
second defendants and
the third defendant that the third defendant had authority to bind the
plaintiff.</b>
<P>

27  	This ground really overlaps with Ground (a) previously
considered but Mr Berry in his written submissions has focussed upon
a passage
on the second page of the judgment of the magistrate where his Worship said:
<P>

<i>"I find on the evidence also that not only were they [the first and the
second defendants] invited to view the property upon which
they would work but
there is a suggestion that Dr Gangemi, a director of the company, on behalf of
the company, offered words of
tacit approval to their employment during or
after a luncheon held on the property `Newry Downs' on or about 9 December
1995."</i>
<P>

28  	Of course the magistrate went on to make the very positive
findings to which I referred earlier when considering Ground (a).
<P>

29  	Mr Berry, in developing his submission on this ground, referred
to part of the first defendant's affidavit and he also referred
to extracts
from Dr Gangemi's statement, Exhibit 8.  He submitted that the evidence did not
establish that the third defendant showed
the written agreement which he
prepared to Dr Gangemi, and he also referred to evidence which the third
defendant gave in the Industrial
Relations Court in December 1998.  The
transcript of that evidence was Exhibit 19 and it appears from it that in
proceedings in that
court the third defendant agreed that he had a discussion
at some stage with Dr Gangemi about wanting to employ the first defendant
as a
casual employee but later that he discussed with Dr Gangemi employing the first
defendant on a full time basis.  According to
the transcript, the third
defendant agreed with the proposition that Dr Gangemi made it clear that he did
not want more full time
staff but was happy to have the first defendant on a
casual basis.
<P>

30  	The evidence in the Industrial Relations Court was not
consistent with the evidence of the third defendant in the Local Court
or with
the content of the statement introduced into evidence as Exhibit 13.  When
cross examined about the evidence that he gave
in the Local Court, the third
defendant repeatedly answered questioning by stating that he did not remember.
The third defendant
told the magistrate that he could not recollect the
questions or the answers in those proceedings in the Industrial Court even
though
they were proceedings which he had taken against the plaintiff for
unfair dismissal.  In the course of his cross examination the
third defendant
said that he was <i>"under heavy medication"</i> when he gave evidence in the
Industrial Court.  Then after the third defendant had been cross examined by Mr
Berry about his questioning
in the Industrial Relations Court and the answers
he gave in those earlier proceedings, the magistrate asked the third defendant
the following question and the third defendant gave the following answer
(T43-44 of 23/12/98):
<P>

<i>"Q.	Is there any evidence you want to give Mr Davison in relation to the
points, some of which you may have taken notes of during
those cross
examinations, that you wanted to clarify now that you may not have had a
sufficient opportunity to clarify, limited to
the answers you were limited
to?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Can I just have a look at the--</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Yes sure</i>
<P>

<i>A.	--points I made?  Your Worship, I think really the only issue which - I
couldn't recollect the context of the - or the questions
and answers in that
unfair dismissal case and had clarified that it was back in that earlier
period, so I've read through that and
I recollect that those series - those
hearings did take place.  I'm not denying that, it's just that I can't
remember, and I know
when it happened in the latter part of the year I was only
just getting sort of back on my feet again and I don't - I certainly can't
remember it word for word and the questions that were asked.  But I do
acknowledge that it happened. So that's it."</i>
<P>

31  	The reference to <i>"getting sort of back on my feet again"</i>
was presumably intended to convey to the magistrate that the third defendant
was then in the course of recovering from the mental
illness which had led to
his admission to Bloomfield Hospital in April 1996 and to his subsequent
assessment by a specialist psychiatrist,
Dr McMurdo (see Annexure D to Exhibit
13).
<P>

32  	In my opinion the effect of the cross examination of the third
defendant by Mr Berry ought to have been to influence the magistrate
to
approach the assessment of the evidence of the third defendant with much
caution.  This is particularly so by reason of what he
had said in the
Industrial Relations Court.  Nevertheless the assessment of the third
defendant's evidence was for the magistrate
to make as the tribunal of fact and
this Court cannot disturb any finding of fact made by the magistrate on
evidence that was available
before him.
<P>

33  	In my opinion Ground (c) must fail.
<P>

<b>Ground (d):	The learned magistrate erred in law in finding that if there was
a valid and binding contract between the first and second
defendants and the
plaintiff, the third defendant was not acting outside the authority (if any) as
manager of the plaintiff.</b>
<P>

34  	It seems to me that this ground is no more than a re-statement
of Ground (c), but Mr Berry in developing his submissions on
it referred to the
fact that the third defendant was suffering from the Bipolar Affective Disorder
diagnosed by Dr McMurdo.  As to
this disorder, the magistrate of course had Dr
McMurdo's report before him (part of Exhibit 13).  In that report Dr McMurdo
explained
the disorder as being
<P>

<i>"a condition with variation of mood so that the individual can swing from
being quite euphoric and grandiose, through to being depressed
and feeling
hopeless and quite ineffectual and indecisive."</i>
<P>

35  	Dr McMurdo later in the report wrote of the third defendant:
<P>

<i>"He was almost certainly unfit for the job for much of this year [that is,
1996] and probably made decisions which were unrealistic
and inappropriate
because of his hypomanic mood."</i>
<P>

36  	Mr Berry referred to features of the evidence which it was
submitted reflected a tendency in the third defendant to act erratically
and
without consultation or authority:
<P>

(i)	In the proceedings in the Industrial Relations Court referred to earlier,
the third defendant was cross examined about discussions
he had had with Dr
Gangemi to purchase two grassliner seeders early in 1996.  One of these items
was to be for the plaintiff's use.
 The third defendant agreed in cross
examination that he obtained a quotation for their purchase and that Dr Gangemi
provided a cheque
for half the deposit but that he later cancelled the order as
to one of those items without prior notification to Dr Gangemi. That
second
machine was not on order for the plaintiff but the point was made that by the
cancellation the plaintiff was exposed to a
risk of some further costs
associated with the order.
<P>

(ii)	The third defendant obtained two quotations in early February 1996, each
relating to the purchase of an expensive International
truck (Exhibit 15).  The
third defendant acknowledged that he obtained those quotations without Dr
Gangemi's knowledge.
<P>

(iii)	The third defendant submitted a document dated 22 January 1996 to a Mr
Price.  This document was called a "proposal" for the
acquisition of a property
known as "Bonnie Doon" by a consortium that included the plaintiff and a then
deregistered company "Werrington
Agribusiness Management Pty Limited".  Whilst
the third defendant said that he had had discussions with Dr Gangemi about the
purchasing
of more land by the plaintiff, he did not have specific instructions
to commit the plaintiff to a venture to acquire "Bonnie Doon".
 The cost under
the "proposal", had it gone ahead, would have exceeded $1.2 million.
<P>

(iv)	The third defendant on 1 February 1996 invited Bathurst Sand, Soil and
Gravel to invoice the deregistered "Werrington Agribusiness
Management Pty
Limited" for the cost of a tri-axle pig trailer.
<P>

37  	Mr Berry submitted that all the evidence I have identified in
considering Ground (d) called for the conclusion that in engaging
the first and
the second defendants on the terms on which he did, the third defendant was
acting outside the scope of his authority.
 Submissions to that effect were
made to the magistrate, as is reflected in the written submissions which Mr
Berry placed before
the Local Court.  To my mind the evidence upon which Mr
Berry was able to draw in addressing the magistrate was formidable indeed,
but
here I am expressing an opinion as to fact.  Whilst such evidence highlighted
the need for a cautious approach to the evaluation
of the evidence of the third
defendant, it remained nevertheless within the province of the magistrate to
determine the issue of
authority.  It is not to the point whether this Court,
had it been the tribunal of fact, would or would not have come to the same
conclusion as the Local Court.  It is not appropriate that I express a view
about that.  The ambit of this appeal is a narrow one
and I am unable to
conclude as a matter of law that the magistrate was compelled to find that the
third defendant was acting outside
the scope of his authority in engaging the
Salters.
<P>

38  	Ground (d) therefore fails.
<P>

<b>Ground (e):	The learned magistrate erred in law in finding that the third
defendant was acting as the agent of the plaintiff</b>
<P>

39  	Mr Berry did not argue this ground discretely and it seems to me
that it must suffer the same fate as Grounds (a)-(d).
<P>

<b>Ground (f):	The learned magistrate erred in law in not finding that the
terms of any contract that may have existed between the first
and second
defendants and the plaintiff was void for vagueness</b>
<P>

40  	I set out the terms of the document when considering Ground
(b).
<P>

41  	Mr Berry, in submitting that the document was void for
uncertainty, made two points:
<P>

(i)	that paragraphs 1 and 2 are inconsistent;
<P>

(ii)	that the document made no provision for the duration of the employment.
<P>

42  	Mr Berry submitted that the document is to be strictly
construed.  I do not consider that to be the appropriate approach. 
This
document was prepared by the third defendant and was a layman's document for
consideration by laymen.  There is no suggestion
that it was subject to
scrutiny by lawyers before the dispute arose between the parties.
<P>

43  	In <i>Carter &amp; Harland - Contract Law in Australia</i> (3rd
ed.) the authors state the principle which I perceive to be relevant here in
these terms:
<P>

<i>"<b>[260]</b>  <b>Difficulty of interpretation distinguished from absence of
meaning</b>.  It has frequently been said that the courts will interpret the
language used broadly and fairly (especially when approaching a
document
drafted by laymen) (see Hillas &amp; Co Ltd v Arcos Ltd <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1932/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1932] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281932%29%20147%20LT%20503" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1932) 147 LT 503</a> at

reasonable meaning on that language unless this is `utterly impossible' (Brown

questioned whether the courts do in fact always avoid the temptation `to repose
on the easy pillow of
saying that the whole is void for uncertainty' (In re

one of upholding agreements wherever possible."</i>

<P>

<i>"The courts are always loath to hold a clause invalid for uncertainty if a
reasonable meaning can be given to it.  Their duty is to
put a fair meaning
upon it, unless this is utterly impossible, and not, as has been said `to

that the whole is void for uncertainty'.

 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20Ch%2053" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] Ch 53</a>, where his Lordship points out, citing from Lord Keith of Avonholm

670 that `the point is one of uncertainty of concept. If it is impossible, on
construction of the condition, to reach a conclusion
as to what was in the
draftsman's mind, the condition is meaningless and must be read as pro non
scripto'.  Megarry J, put the question
in another way, namely as `one of
linguistic or semantic uncertainty, and not of difficulty of ascertainment'
(see per Lord Wilberforce
in McPhail v Doulton <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1970/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1970] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%20AC%20424" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] AC 424</a>, at p. 457);
earlier he had referred to `uncertainty of concept as contracted with mere
difficulty of application' (p. 57)...</i>
<P>

<i>In relation to commercial contracts `the problem for a court of construction
must always be so to balance matters that, without violation
of essential
principle, the dealings of men may as far as possible be treated as effective,
and that the law may not incur the reproach
of being the destroyer of bargains'
(per Lord Tomlin in Hillas and Co Ltd v Arcos Ltd <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1932/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1932] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281932%29%20147%20LT%20503" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1932) 147 LT 503</a>, at p.
512). `Business men' said Lord Wright in the same case (p. 514) `often record
the most important agreements in wide and summary
fashion; modes of expression
sufficient and clear to them in the course of their business may appear to
those unfamiliar with the
business far from complete or precise. It is,
accordingly, the duty of the court to construe such documents fairly and
broadly, without
being too astute or subtle in finding defects; but, on the
contrary the court should seek to apply the old maxim of English law,
verba ita
sunt intelligenda ut res magis valeat quam pereat.'"</i>

said:
<P>

<i>But a contract of which there can be more than one possible meaning or which
when construed can produce in its application more than
one result is not
therefore void for uncertainty.  As long as it is capable of a meaning, it will
ultimately bear that meaning which
the courts, or in an appropriate case, an
arbitrator, decides is its proper construction: and the court or arbitrator
will decide
its application.  The question becomes one of construction, of
ascertaining the intention of the parties, and of applying it. Lord
Tomlin&#180;s words in this connexion in Hillas &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Arcos Ltd.
<a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1932/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1932] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281932%29%20147%20LT%20503" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1932) 147 LT 503</a>, at p 512 ought to be kept in mind. So long as the language
employed by the parties, to use Lord Wright&#180;s words in Scammell
(G.) &amp;
Nephew Ltd. v. Ouston  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281941%29%20AC%20251" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1941) AC 251</a> is not "so obscure and so incapable of any
definite or precise meaning that the Court is unable to attribute to the
parties any particular
contractual intention", the contract cannot be held to
be void or uncertain or meaningless. In the search for that intention, no
narrow or pedantic approach is warranted, particularly in the case of
commercial arrangements. Thus will uncertainty of meaning,
as distinct from
absence of meaning or of intention, be resolved.</i>
<P>

particular the judgment of Gibbs CJ at 578.
<P>

47  	Mindful of the above statements of principle, I consider the
writing in the present case.
<P>

48  	According to the second plaintiff the explanation given by the
third defendant for term 2 was to express a lesser rate of remuneration
for the
third defendant <i>"because Dr Gangemi doesn't like to see a woman paid at the
same rate as a male"</i>.  Whether that unattractive explanation for Term 2
explains it or not, it is to be observed that once the second defendant worked
any number of hours, this reduced the available number of hours attracting an
hourly rate of $12, so that once the second defendant
did any work at all,
assuming the application of the rates stated in paragraph 2, it would not have
been possible to reach $780 per
week for an aggregate of only sixty-five hours
of work.
<P>

49  	Whether the magistrate considered the significance of this
second condition, and the explanation for its introduction, when
addressing the
issue of the third defendant's authority to enter into the contract for the
plaintiff is not apparent from the judgment.
 However paragraphs 1 and 2 each
provide for a combined weekly wage of $780.  Paragraph 2 provides that that sum
is to be paid for
sixty-five hours work and sixty-five hours work at $12 per
hour totals $780.
<P>

50  	In my opinion it would be inconsistent with authority to strike
the agreement down as void for uncertainty because of what
is provided for in
paragraph 2.  The two paragraphs are capable of a reasonable meaning, namely
that the Salters were to be paid
a combined wage of $780 per week for an
aggregate of sixty-five hours work.
<P>

51  	Paragraph 5 provided for the manner of payment of phone and
electricity charges:
<P>

<i>" 5.	Max and Jenny are responsible for Phone and electricity.  Employer pays
standing charges on phone and electricity.</i>
<P>

52  	Mr Berry, in written submissions, argued that this paragraph was
internally inconsistent.  He did not address this submission
in oral argument
but in my opinion the submission is not sound.  The paragraph has this
reasonable meaning:  that the first and second
defendants were to pay
consumption expenses for phone calls made and electricity used, but the
plaintiff was to pay charges such
as telephone service and equipment charges,
including phone rental, and the service availability charge for electricity.
<P>

53  	Even if, contrary to the view I have reached, this paragraph was
void for uncertainty, it would not call for the entire agreement
to be struck
down and no claim was advanced by the first and the second defendants for
damages for the failure by the plaintiff to
comply with paragraph 5.
<P>

54  	Finally, Mr Barry has submitted that the document does not
provide for the duration of the contract of employment.  Plainly
this is
correct.  However, it does not follow that there exists no enforceable
contract.  A distinction must be drawn between a case
where a contract fails
for incompleteness because the parties have reached no agreement, and a case
where agreement has been reached
but not all the terms have been reduced to
writing.  An agreement may be enforced where the agreement is proved to be
partly oral
and partly written, or where it is appropriate to regard a term or
terms unexpressed in the document as implied into the arrangement.
 In
<i>Carter &amp; Harland - Contract Law in Australia</i> (3rd ed.) there appears
the following relevant statement of principle:
<P>

<i>"<b>[268]  Implication of terms</b>.  A seemingly incomplete agreement will
often be enforced because the courts will imply in the contract terms relating
to essential
matters which the parties themselves have not expressly dealt
with.  These terms may be implied under a rule of law relating to the
type of
transaction in question or may be implied from the particular facts."</i>
<P>

55  	The evidence was that the first and the second defendants were
in regular employment in Tamworth when they were approached
by the third
defendant.  The first defendant was asked by the third defendant to supply
details of the then existing terms of employment
of the first and the second
defendants and responded by advising the third defendant that their combined
wage was $780 per week and
that they were provided with a house and a vehicle.
The third defendant responded by advising he would consider <i>"whether we
could match your current package"</i>.  The third defendant later advised:
<P>

<i>"I have worked it out that we can pay you and Jen $780 per week.  We will
find a house and we will pay the rent and we will supply
a vehicle.  I'll make
up a draft contract and send it by fax to you for approval."</i>
<P>

56  	According to the first defendant, he then said:
<P>

<i>"I don't want to finish up here unless it's permanent work down
there."</i>
<P>

57  	The first defendant said that the third defendant responded:
<P>

<i>"Yes, this is permanent work.  We're in for the long term.  This property is
4000 acres.  It's been neglected.  There is a hell of
a lot of work to do.  Dr
Joe Gangemi has a five year programme but he has put pressure on me to get it
done in two years if possible.
 If I'm to have any chance of getting it done in
that time, I'll need you and Jen."</i>
<P>

58  	The evidence I have above reviewed was set out in the affidavit
of the first defendant tendered in the proceedings before the
magistrate.  That
evidence was not challenged and I note that the magistrate obviously formed a
favourable impression of the first
defendant, commenting that he <i>"gave his
evidence in a clear and honest fashion"</i>.  The magistrate referred in his
judgment to the circumstances in which the first and the second defendants were
living in Tamworth
before they went to "Newry Downs":
<P>

<i>"The plaintiffs, Mr and Mrs Salter, were in permanent employment in the
rural industry in Tamworth.  They apparently were in a relatively
comfortable
situation with a house and vehicle with fuel supplied.  I find on the facts
that they were contacted by Mr Charles Davison,
the manager of the defendant
company, and were offered the opportunity to work for Gangemi Holdings Pty
Limited..."</i>
<P>

59  	Consistently with the assertion that the first and the second
defendants' participation in a two year programme was being sought
by the third
defendant was the fact that the third defendant arranged the letting of the
house to accommodate the first and the second
defendants for a period of twelve
months with a twelve months option.  Arrangements for the letting were on the
evidence made in
late December or early January 1996 and the lease was
expressed to run from 1 February 1996 which was the date from which the
agreement
signed by the first and the second defendants and by the third
defendant was expressed to be effective.
<P>

60  	It seems to me that on the above unchallenged evidence it was
appropriate to imply into the contract a term as to its duration
and that Mr
Berry's submission to the contrary must be rejected.
<P>

61  	What was the term to be implied?  The magistrate did not spell
out his approach to this, but it is clear from the damages he
assessed that he
quantified damages on the basis that the contract was to be regarded as being
one for two years.  He accepted the
claim as detailed and calculated on that
basis in a document tendered on 21 December 1998 (T 2).
<P>

62  	The magistrate has not stated his reasons for what he did but no
ground of appeal complains of the failure to give reasons,
nor as to the
approach taken to the assessment of damages once the challenge to the contract
on the basis of its uncertainty failed.
 In this regard Mr Berry's approach on
this appeal has been entirely consistent with his approach at first instance,
as reflected
by his written submissions presented to the magistrate and made
available to this Court.
<P>

63  	Having regard to the way in which the hearing was conducted at
first instance and having regard to the way in which the appeal
has been
argued, this Court is not called upon to consider either the aptness of the
implication of a term of two years which the
magistrate obviously found or the
manner of quantification of damages.  It suffices on the issues raised on the
appeal to hold as
I do that the claim does not fail for uncertainty or
incompleteness because no term governing the length of the employment was
expressed
and that the facts of this case made it appropriate to imply into the
contract a term as to its duration.
<P>

64  	For the reasons I have stated, Ground (f) fails.
<P>

<b>Ground (g):	That the learned magistrate erred in law in finding that the
first and second defendants did not know or could not have
known that the third
defendant was acting erratically</b>
<P>

65  	It was submitted that the first defendant, by reason of his
prior dealings, should have been aware that the third defendant
was acting
erratically.  Mr Berry relied on the extracts from the evidence of Ms Foley and
Messrs Fagan, Robson and Defina which
I set out earlier in considering Ground
(b), and also upon the admissions the first defendant made in cross examination
that he had
known the third defendant for a long time.  As I observed earlier,
it was for the magistrate to assess the significance of this evidence
as well
as the relevant denials expressed by the first defendant in the course of cross
examination.  If the first and the second
defendants were reliant upon
ostensible authority to succeed against the plaintiff, then their awareness
that the third defendant
was acting erratically at the time the agreement was
entered into, if proved, would have been a relevant consideration.  However
the
plaintiff's liability is not based upon a finding of ostensible authority but
actual authority.  In any event, even assuming
an awareness of erratic
behaviour was relevant to actual authority, the magistrate made a finding (p 4
of the judgment) that there
was no evidence before him which he 
<P>

<i>"could safely rely on to say that the [first and second defendants] knew or
ought to have known that Mr Davison was acting outside
of any authority he had
or was acting erratically."</i>
<P>

66  	That finding represented an evaluation of the evidence and was a
finding of fact, not a finding of law, and is not open to
challenge on this
appeal.
<P>

67  	Accordingly Ground (g) fails.
<P>

<b>Ground (h):	The learned magistrate erred in law in not finding that, if
there existed a valid and binding contract between the first
and second
defendants and the plaintiff, the third defendant acted outside his authority
and is liable to the plaintiff for any damages
suffered by him.</b>
<P>

68  	This ground is directed to the case against the third defendant
and to the relief sought by the plaintiff against that defendant.
<P>

69  	Mr Berry has submitted that if the first and the second
defendants were entitled to succeed against the plaintiff, then the
plaintiff
was entitled to succeed against the third defendant on its third party claim in
the Local Court.  Hence in this Court,
should the plaintiff fail on appeal as
against the first and the second defendants, Mr Berry submits that the
plaintiff would then
be entitled to be indemnified by the third defendant, and
that any liability for the costs of the first and the second defendant
should
also be passed on to the third defendant by way of <i>Bullock</i> order.
<P>

70  	Mr Macrossan, who has appeared for the third defendant in this
Court, has argued to the contrary.
<P>

71  	The basis of the third party claim was not expressed in the
third party notice in the Local Court but the expression of the
ground of
appeal makes it clear that the claim that the liability should be passed on to
the third defendant is based solely upon
an assertion that the third defendant
acted outside his authority in engaging the services of the Salters.
<P>

72  	In arguing this ground Mr Berry has relied upon the evidence
relied upon and earlier considered in relation to Ground (c).
<P>

73  	The magistrate did not base the plaintiff's liability to the
first and the second defendants upon a finding of ostensible authority
but upon
a finding of actual authority.  The evidence which Mr Berry has referred to in
his written submissions to support this ground
was evidence to be weighed by
the magistrate in determining whether the third defendant did have actual
authority as he claimed.
 It seems to me, however, that Mr Macrossan is correct
in his submission that the finding reached by the learned magistrate that
the
third defendant had actual authority to engage the Salters was a finding of
fact that cannot be disturbed here, for the very
same reasons I expressed in
earlier considering Ground (a).
<P>

74  	Accordingly the finding of actual authority inevitably defeats
the plaintiff's claim against the third defendant, based as
it is upon a
submission that no such authority existed.  Hence Ground (h) must fail.
<P>

<b>Ground (i):	The learned magistrate erred in law in not finding that the
first and second defendants and the third defendant had conspired
to defraud
the plaintiff</b>
<P>

75  	A conspiracy between the three defendants to defraud the
plaintiff was not pleaded in the Local Court, although paragraph 12
of the
grounds of defence to the claim of the first and second defendants did raise
the issue of fraud.  However, it does seem that
the matter was raised in the
Local Court because the magistrate referred to it in a passage in the judgment
which I shall shortly
record.
<P>

76  	Mr Berry submitted that the very same evidence relied upon to
prove awareness of erratic behaviour identified in support of
Ground (g) avails
the plaintiff on this present ground.  However Mr Berry's submission did not
find favour with the magistrate. 
In considering Ground (g) I have already
adverted to what the magistrate said in a passage commencing on p 4 of his
judgment.  For
the purposes of this present ground, I continue by reciting what
the magistrate said at the very foot of p 4 and on p 5:
<P>

<i>"Given my assessment of them [the first and the second defendants] as
witnesses and their demeanour in the witness box, I cannot accept
that they
would forgo their employment, move from Tamworth and change course at their
stage of their lives to the extent that they
did on the whim of a man they
suspected of being mentally disturbed.  That does not accord with one's usual
experience of life. 
For them to have taken that course with that knowledge
would result in a conclusion that they did so with a view to conspiring to
defraud the company.  My view is that Ms Foley's evidence provides confirmation
of the fact that Mr Salter, given previous dealings
with the third party, felt
decidedly comfortable on this occasion, given that he had the security of a
written contract with his
new employer.  This is particularly so given the fact
he had obviously taken a risk in leaving the security of his previous
employment.
 I really cannot understand the vigour with which Mr Casey cross
examined Ms Foley.  It is my view that the witness' evidence enhances
his
clients' cases against the company in that it serves to confirm their level of
satisfaction that, notwithstanding any criticism
of the third party in any
previous dealings, this time they had their new employment package locked in
concrete.</i>
<P>

<i>Mr Salter gave his evidence in a clear and apparently honest fashion.  I am
satisfied that he at all times believed he was being employed
by the company
and there can be no suggestion on his evidence that he was involved in any
conspiracy to defraud Gangemi Holdings."</i>
<P>

77  	Plainly in the above passage the magistrate considered and
rejected the notion of a conspiracy to defraud the plaintiff.  The
magistrate's
consideration of that issue involved an assessment of fact and as such cannot
be reviewed in this Court.  In my opinion
it simply cannot be contended that
the evidence compelled as a matter of law a finding of the conspiracy claim in
Ground (i).
<P>

<b>Conclusions and formal orders</b>
<P>

78  	It follows, since the plaintiff has failed to establish any
error of law, that this summons must be dismissed.
<P>

79  	It was appropriate that each defendant should be represented in
this Court, and that the third defendant should have separate
representation.
In my opinion, costs should follow the event.
<P>

80  	The formal orders of the Court are accordingly as follows:
<P>

1.	The summons is dismissed;
<P>

2.	I order the plaintiff to pay the defendants' costs.
<P>
