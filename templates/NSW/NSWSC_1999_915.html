<b><u>2625/96 HUGH JENNER WILY in his capacity as Liquidator of AUR NL (IN
LIQUIDATION), AUR NL (IN LIQUIDATION) v RAL AUSTRALIA</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>Outline</b>
<P>

1   	Mr. Wily, the liquidator of AUR NL (In Liquidation) (AUR)
seeks to set aside two transactions, one on the basis it took place
within six
months prior to the date of commencement of the winding up conferring a benefit
on the defendant Rothschild Australia
Ltd (RAL) and is void against the
liquidator; the other on the basis that it was either a disposition of property
of AUR to RAL after
the commencement of the winding up or a transaction prior
to commencement of the winding up void against the liquidator.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

2   	An application for the winding up of AUR was filed on 3
July 1990, and the winding up commenced on that date.  An order for
winding up
was made on 1 March 1991 and Mr. Wily was appointed liquidator.
<P>

3   	AUR was a listed company engaged in the business of gold
mining, predominantly at a mine called the Mt. Martin mine.  Gold
mining
companies apparently obtain finance to carry out their mining operations by
arranging what are called "gold loans" through
certain finance providers.  The
intricacies of these arrangements were never properly explained, but the
essential feature is that
a certain sum of money is made available to the mine
operator; that there is calculated how many fine troy ounces of gold this
amount
would purchase at the then spot price; and that the loan is repayable by
payment of that amount of gold together with an additional
amount called gold
fees which would represent the interest component.
<P>

4   	On 13 November 1987 AUR obtained a gold loan facility from
RAL, secured partly by letter of credit issued by the Bank of New
Zealand.
This loan was eventually paid out by RAL calling on the letter of credit.  The
loan was referred to throughout as the "first
gold loan" but really has little
to do with the proceedings.  On 23 August 1988 AUR obtained a further gold loan
facility from RAL
(the second gold loan facility) for an amount of $4,600,000
(the second gold loan), the main subject of these proceedings.
<P>

5   	Clause 11A(a) of the second gold loan facility agreement
provided as follows: 
<P>

<b>11A	<u>GENERAL UNDERTAKINGS</u></b>
<P>

(a)	The Company shall as and when reasonably required by RAL enter into
arrangements satisfactory to RAL (which may include forward
sales contracts,
options or floor price schemes) for the management and protection of gold price
risk associated with the production
of gold form the Project during the term of
this Facility.  Such arrangements shall be entered into with RAL or other
substantial
financial institution considered by RAL in its reasonable opinion
to be of no less high reputation and experience in such arrangements
as RAL.
If such arrangements are entered into with RAL the Company shall lodge on
deposit with RAL sufficient cash or other security
as required by RAL (secured
if required by RAL by first charge) to secure such arrangements which deposit
or security shall be in
addition to the deposits or securities (if any)
otherwise referred to in this Facility.
<P>

The evidence of Mr. Lee, the managing director of RAL and of Mr. Russo, who was
the head of the bullion trade section of RAL at
the relevant times, establishes
that gold loans are usually protected by hedging facilities involving forward
sales of gold at a
specified price on a future date or forward sales at the
spot price plus a premium without specified date for sale.  The purpose
of
these hedging facilities is to protect the miner and the finance company
against sharp drops in the price of gold, so as to ensure
the gold loan will be
repaid.  As these facilities in the instant case were arranged with RAL it can
be presumed that RAL had in
place its own facilities further down the line, but
that does not matter here.  The effect of the hedging facility was that AUR
forward
sold to RAL a proportion of its expected production from the Mount
Martin mine although in fact the contracts could have been satisfied
by AUR
buying in gold from elsewhere.  The hedging arrangements were governed by the
terms of a bullion forward sales facility agreement
between RAL and ALR, dated
11 June 1987 and a spot deferred forward sale facility annexed thereto.
<P>

6   	To further protect its position RAL required AUR to enter
into a deed of charge with RAL dated 23 May 1988 the provisions of
which I will
refer to in detail later, but the intent of which was to secure the gold loans.
AUR entered into a further deed dated
12 October 1988 which was a fixed and
floating charge the intent of which was the same.  There can be no doubt that
both securities
provided security for the second gold facility or second gold
loan.
<P>

7   	By the end of May 1990 AUR owed to RAL on the smaller gold
loan facility 6,022.913 fine troy ounces of gold.  It also had forward
contracts outstanding under which it agreed to sell 27,200 fine troy ounces of
gold to RAL at a specified price and had 5,102.695
fine troy ounces of gold
outstanding under deferred contracts under which AUR had agreed to sell to RAL
under a forward sale facility.
 That quantity of gold had a spot price plus an
interest component.  The unchallenged evidence of Mr. Lee was that these
forward
sales contracts were entered into in compliance with clause 11A of the
second gold loan facility.  Nevertheless whatever the expectation
there was no
requirement that these forward sale contracts had to be satisfied or closed out
by delivery of gold from the Mt. Martin
mines.  Gold could have been purchased
from any outside source.
<P>

8   	By June 1990 the price of gold had plummeted from the 1988
price.  It thus became possible for gold to be purchased by or on
behalf of AUR
at a relatively low price, and for AUR to deliver that amount to RAL in
satisfaction or part satisfaction of the hedging
contracts bringing about a
considerable profit to AUR.  What happened was that RAL arranged for AUR to buy
4,033.138 fine troy ounces
of gold which was delivered to RAL in satisfaction
of the spot deferred positions bringing about a profit in AUR of $328,081.57.
In addition AUR purchased 27,200 fine troy ounces of gold for the purpose of
closing out the forward sales contract and in doing
so generated a profit of
$1,173,994.23.  There was thus available to AUR a total profit of $1,502,075.80
of which the sum of $752,075.64
was used to purchase 1,684.30 fine troy ounces
of gold which was delivered on 18 June 1990 to RAL and credited against the
smaller
gold loan facility, which after interest (gold fees) were taken into
account, left owing to RAL on the second gold loan 5,060.846
fine troy ounces.
The amount of $750,002.16 which was not used for this purchase was paid into
what was called a "blocked account"
with RAL in the name of a company AUR
Management Pty. Limited, which was part of the AUR group, and which on the
evidence of Mr.
Andrew Wily was a company that "performed the management,
treasury and revenue functions for companies in the AUR group including
AUR".
The result of all of this was that the smaller gold loan was partly discharged
and a balance of funds was available in cash
to AUR subject to any charge which
RAL might have had over it.  No point was taken about the blocked account being
in the name of
AUR Management, presumably because it held the funds for AUR in
any event.
<P>

9   	On 20 June 1990 RAL agreed to release $100,000 from the
blocked account for the purpose of paying an insurance broker an amount
due for
current insurance premiums.  A request for payment of a further $200,000 from
the blocked account was refused.
<P>

10   	A meeting of directors of AUR commenced on 2 July 1990 and
was adjourned to 9.30 a.m. the next day when the directors resolved
to apply
for the winding up of the company and for the appointment of a provisional
liquidator.  On  3 July 1990 Mr. P.B. Allen was
appointed provisional
liquidator.  On the same date RAL applied the funds remaining in the blocked
account, namely $650,002.16 to
the purchase of 1452.872 ounces of gold on
behalf of AUR and on that date applied this in reduction of the smaller gold
loan facility.
 On 5 July 1990, RAL sent to AUR notice of default in respect of
this facility and a week later appointed receivers and managers
to AUR pursuant
to the deed of charge, dated 23 May 1988.  
<P>

11   	The transactions which the liquidator challenges are
really not those identified in paragraphs 13(a) and(b) of the statement
of
claim but rather the following:
<P>

1.	The transfer of 1684.30 ounces of gold on 18 June 1990 in reduction of the
smaller gold loan.
<P>

2.	The transfer of 1452.872 ounces of gold on 3 July 1990 to RAL in further
reduction of the smaller gold loan.
<P>

The case was argued on this basis without objection.  It is claimed the first
transaction amounted to a preference void against
the liquidator pursuant to
s451 of the Companies (New South Wales) Code; and by late amendment, that the
second payment was made
either (i) after the commencement of the winding up and
was void against the liquidator under s368 of the Code; or (ii) before the
commencement of the winding up and was a preference void against the
liquidator; or (3) before or after the commencement of the winding
up and void
against the liquidator.  I have by separate judgment delivered today explained
how this late amendment came about.
<P>

12   	It is clear that at the time of each transaction AUR was
insolvent and unable to pay its debts as they fell due. 
<P>

13   	RAL in its defence says that it held security over the
funds applied to purchase the gold; that in any event there was no
preference
as it had a right of set off.
<P>

<b>Issues</b>
<P>

14   	The questions for determination are:  (i) whether the
claim of RAL to security is correct; (ii) whether in relation to the
funds in
the blocked account security could be held; and (iii) whether there was a right
of set off which would defeat the claim
of the liquidator.
<P>

<b>Provisions of the charge documents</b>
<P>

15   	The small gold loan facility dated 23 August 1988
provided, as a condition precedent to draw down, that security be given
by AUR
to RAL in a form satisfactory to RAL and its solicitors by, insofar as is
relevant here, 
<P>

a first registered fixed and floating charge over the interest of the company
in the project and all the project assets (including
plant and equipment)
including the company's right title and interest in the tribute agreement.
<P>

It may be that the fixed and floating charge of 12 October 1988 was given in
response to this provision.  It is stated to be collateral
with the charge of
23 May 1988.
<P>

16   	The deed of charge dated 23 May 1988 is expressed to be in
consideration of the mortgagor (an obvious mistake for mortgagee)
forbearing to
sue in respect of existing loans and in consideration of advances to be given,
and charges in favour of RAL "the mortgaged
premises".  Clause 36 defines "the
mortgaged premises", "venture", and "production".
<P>

17   	The particular parts of clause 36 relied upon by RAL as
bringing the profits generated from the close out of the forward sale
contracts
and the gold delivered against the smaller gold loan within the ambit of the
May charge are:
<P>

36.	<u>THAT</u> except to the extent that such interpretation shall be excluded
by or be repugnant to the context whenever the same is used herein:
<P>

(a)	The expression "the mortgaged premises" means all of the legal and
beneficial right, title and interest of the Mortgagor in
the Treatment Plant
and in the Venture and all property and assets of the Mortgagor relating to the
Venture from time to time including,
without limitation:-
<P>

(i)	the tenements (not relied on)
<P>

(ii)	all other property, rights and interests acquired or contracted to be
acquired from time to time for the purposes of the Venture;
<P>

	...
<P>

(v)	all of the Mortgagor's interest and estate in, to and under agreements,
arrangements or understandings relating to the Venture
to which the Mortgagor
is a party or is otherwise bound;
<P>

	...
<P>

(viii)	all the Mortgagor's right, title and interest, to and under all
agreements entered into by or on behalf of the Mortgagor
for the sale of
production and all benefit and advantage to be derived by the Mortgagor
thereunder and therefrom:
<P>

(ix)	all moneys due, owing or payable or to become due, owing or payable to the
Mortgagor in respect of the sale of Production;
<P>

	...
<P>

(xi)	all proceeds receivable by the Mortgagor from any sales of assets acquired
or constructed by or on behalf of the Mortgagor
for the purposes of the
Venture.
<P>

(b)	The expression "Venture" means the venture previously constituted by the
heads of Agreement dated 25th August, 1984 between
the Phillips Syndicate
(being James William Phillips, George Allison Phillips and Peter Farquhar
Bowman), the Mortgagor and the Debtor
and described therein as the Phillips
Joint Venture and now carried on by the Mortgagor in respect of the Tenements
and includes
all activities carried out on or with respect to the Tenements for
the purpose of developing the Tenements to obtain gold and other
minerals by
the mining, extraction and refining of gold and other minerals on and from the
Tenements including, without limitation,
the following activities:-
<P>

(i)	exploration for gold and other minerals;
<P>

(ii)	the mining, extraction, crushing, screening, refining, transportation,
handling, storage, loading for shipment and delivery
of gold and other minerals
on and from the Tenements (including the extraction of gold from tailings dumps
situated on the Tenement);
<P>

(iii)	the operation of the Treatment Plant, and all other plant, machinery,
equipment, buildings and structures and other facilities
required to mine and
produce gold and other minerals on and from the Tenements;
<P>

(iv)	the doing of all acts and things which may be necessary or advisable for
the efficient and economical conduct of the venture.
<P>

(c)	The expression "Tenements" means all of the right, title and interest of
the Mortgagor in or conferred by the agreement dated
24th May, 1985 between Mt.
Martin Gold Mines N.L. of the one part and the Mortgagor, the Debtor, James
William Phillips, George Allison
Phillips and Peter Farquhar Bowman of the
other party and known as the "Mt. Martin Tribute Agreement" in respect of the
Mt. Martin
Gold Mine as defined therein and any extension or renewal thereof
and any further agreement with the Mortgagor relating to the said
Mt. Martin
Gold mine.
<P>

(d)	The expression "Production" means gold and other minerals in whatever form
and ore containing same produced by the Mortgagor
or others from or in relation
to the Venture
<P>

	...
<P>

18   	So far as the October charge is concerned it charges in
favour of RAL "the project assets wherever situate both present and
future".
"Project", "Project Assets" so far as relevant and "Project Production" are
defined in Clause 26(1)(s),(t) and (u) as follows:
<P>

(s)	"Project" means the project known as the Mount Martin Project located
approximately 34km south of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia
including the
development, construction, mining, working and operation of the mine located on
the Tenements and the associated plant
and equipment and infrastructure.
<P>

(t)	"Project Assets" means all property and all interests in property of any
kind now or in the future owned, held or acquired by
the Mortgagor where the
dominant purpose for which such property is owned, held or acquired is its use
in or in relation to the Project
and includes (without limitation) the right
tile and interest of the Mortgagor in: 
<P>

(f)	all Project Production;
<P>

(g)	all contracts for sale of Project Production;
<P>

	...
<P>

(i)	all contracts for the sale of gold, silver or minerals described in
paragraph (f);
<P>

	...
<P>

(k)	all choses in action and rights and benefits conferred by or pursuant to
any document or agreement (including the Joint Venture
Agreement and other
Project Documents or pursuant to any document or agreement now or in the future
entered into for the purposes
of the Joint Venture or any agreements or
documents amending the same) now or in the future entered into for the purposes
of the
Project or the sale of Project Production;
<P>

(u)	"Project Production" means all gold, silver or other mineral products
produced from the Project;
<P>

...
<P>

19   	Both charges were fixed and floating charges, but as an
event of default had occurred prior to the impugned transactions the
floating
charges had crystallised.
<P>

<b>Charged Property</b>
<P>

20   	While the evidence is that the forward sales contracts
were entered into pursuant to the requirements of clause 11A of the
small gold
loan facility they are not property specifically referred to as being subject
to any charge, and even if they were that
would not carry the day on closing
out.  Thus it is necessary to consider the provisions of each charge relied
upon by RAL as giving
it security over the gold used to repay the gold loans.
Its is convenient to give consideration first to those provisions in each
charge relied upon as giving security, which I do not consider assist RAL and
which I can deal with quite quickly.
<P>

<b>May charge - first consideration</b>
<P>

21   	I have set out the provisions on which RAL relies.  I do
not consider the gold paid to RAL in respect of either transaction
falls within
sub-clauses v, viii, ix or xi of Clause 36(a).  That is because the gold is not
an interest in or under any agreement,
arrangement or undertaking relating to
the venture; it is not an interest to or under an agreement for the sale of
production as
production is defined; it is not money due in respect of sale of
production as defined; and it is not proceeds of sale of assets,
although it
might possibly have been acquired with such proceeds. 
<P>

<b>October charge - first consideration</b>
<P>

22   	RAL does not rely on Clause 26(1)(t)(f) although I have
reproduced it to make the decision clear.  The gold transferred cannot
come
within (g) or (i) for the reason that it has no connection with project
production.  It could not come within (k) as it is not
a benefit under any
document.  A profit made on closing out a contract is not a benefit conferred
by such agreement on any reasonable
and untortured construction.
<P>

<b>Remaining possibilities</b>
<P>

23   	There remain for consideration the general definition at
the commencement of Clause 36(a) of the May charge; Clause 36(a)(ii)
of that
charge and general words of Clause 26(1)(t) of the October charge and I now
deal with these.
<P>

24   	I think it correct to state that while the forward sales
contracts were entered into for the purpose of securing the future
of the Mt.
Martin mine it is quite unlikely that any attention was given to them when
drawing up the charge documents.  If the charges
result in security over the
profits on closing out or over gold purchased with those profits it is more
good luck than good drafting.
 Nobody would think on first reading of the
charges that they gave security over the assets said to be subject to the
charge.  The
profits had nothing whatever to do with the project apart from the
fact that the forward sales would not have been arranged were
it not for the
project.  Having said that I return to this matter which I have found
particularly difficult.
<P>

<b>36(a) general words</b>
<P>

25   	The question is whether the profits on closing out or the
gold purchased with those profits were property and assets relating
to the
venture.  That is, did they relate to an activity carried out on or with
respect to the tenements for the purpose of developing
the tenements to obtain
gold and other minerals by the mining, extraction and refining of gold on and
from the tenements.  I consider
they did not.  The activities referred to seem
to be limited to physical activities on the tenements.  Profits arising from
closing
out a futures contract with non-tenement gold do not fall reasonably
within this part of the definition.
<P>

<b>36(a)(ii) May Charge, 26(1)(t) October Charge</b>
<P>

26   	The question here is whether the profits or the gold are
property relating to the venture being property acquired or contracted
to be
acquired from time to time for the purposes of the venture.  While the venture
agreement referred to in the definition of venture
is not in evidence, the
evidence nevertheless is clear enough that the venture is the gold mining
venture carried on at the Mt. Martin
Mine.  The hedging contracts were acquired
for the purposes of the venture.  The hedging programme was agreed between Mr.
Russo of
RAL and Mr. Peterson on behalf of AUR.  The close out of the forward
contracts came about as a result of conversations between Mr.
Russo and Mr.
Peterson in the first half of 1990, when Mr. Peterson said to Mr. Russo words
to the effect 
<P>

I authorise the close out of the forward sales contracts and for approximately
$750,000 to be paid into a RAL blocked deposit account
with the balance of
funds being applied to purchase gold to reduce the gold loan.
<P>

If loan funds were obtained for the purposes of the venture, as they clearly
were, I think it clear their repayment was a purpose
of the venture.  It
follows the profits on closing out were property acquired for the purpose of
the venture.  Insofar as $752,073.64
was applied for the purchase of gold to
reduce the gold loan, that gold would for the same reason be property acquired
for the purpose
of the venture and accordingly covered by the security.
<P>

27   	So far as the moneys in the blocked account are concerned
there is nothing to suggest that the application of the balance
of $650,002.16
in that account was with the authority of AUR.  Thus unless RAL held security
over that blocked account or the funds
in the account it had no security over
the gold purchased with the proceeds in that account.  There is no evidence
this money was
acquired for the purposes of repayment of the gold loans.  Had
it been then one would have assumed it would have been used for that
purpose
immediately.  While there is no direct evidence of its intended disposition, I
consider it clear it was only to be used in
connection with the venture and
acquired for that purpose.  The only withdrawal from it was for that purpose.
The further withdrawal
of $200,000, which was sought was for that purpose.  The
parties clearly treated the blocked account as being under RAL control.
 Thus
if it was possible to have security over that account, I consider the funds in
the blocked account fell within clause 36(a)(ii).
 For much the same reasons I
consider the proceeds to be held "for the purposes of the project" under clause
26(1)(t) of the October
charge.  
<P>

28   	The moneys were deposited with RAL in an account in the
name of AUR or in the name of its management company.  In other words
RAL owed
to AUR the amount in the deposit account.  As with many other matters in this
case, there is no proper evidence of the terms
of the deposit.  The question
then is whether RAL could have security over the debt it owed its depositor.

question arose under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act 1920</a> as to whether a direction to
hold money deposited with a bank as security for advances amounted to a
mortgage or a debenture so as
it make it a loan security, under that Act.  Lee
J said at 46:  
<P>

The very fact that "the deposit" means no more than an indebtedness of the bank
to the plaintiff in the sum of $4,000 to be discharged
on 2 November 1981,
makes it impossible, in my view, for it to be held that the instrument is a
mortgage or charge, on the simple
footing that there can be no mortgage or
charge in favour of oneself of ones own indebtedness to another.
<P>

29   	In saying this he purported to follow the decisions in
<b><cite>Halesowen Presswork and Assemblies Limited v Westminster Bank
Limited</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%201%20QB%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 1 QB 1</a> and on appeal <b><cite>National Westminster
Bank Ltd v Halesgrove Presswork Assemblies Limited</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20AC%20785" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] AC 785</a>,
although it was liens that were under consideration there.  As I understand it
this position was regarded as correct in law until
the decision of the House of
Lords in <b><cite>Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No.
8)</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20AC%20214" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] AC 214.</a>  In that case, although not necessary for the
decision, the House of Lords disapproved the decision of Millett J in
<b><cite>In Re Chargecard Services Limited</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20Ch%20150" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] Ch 150</a>, in which
case, according to Lord Hoffman, the doctrine of conceptual impossibility was
first propounded.  At least so far as this
country is concerned, that is not
the position.  It was that decision which was discussed and affirmed in the
Court of Appeal in
<b><cite>Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No.
8)</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20Ch%20245" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] Ch 245</a>, after a careful review of authorities and academic
writing most of which I have considered.  The principal speech in the House of
Lords was given by Lord Hoffman, the other Law Lords agreeing with him.  This
decision leaves a trial judge in a difficult position.
 There is little to be
gained by expressing an individual view and great weight must be given to the
House of Lords decision, even
if it has had a less than enthusiastic reception
from at least one commentator, namely Professor Goode:  see  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=114%20Law%20Quarterly%20Review%20178" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">114 LQR 178.</a>
However, the fact that the decision in <b><cite>Broad</cite></b> has stood for
nearly twenty years, and that it was followed in <b><cite>Estate Planning
Associates (Australia) Pty. Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties</cite></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%202%20NSWLR%20495" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] 2 NSWLR 495</a> and accepted as correct in <b><cite>Esanda Finance
Corporation v Jackson</cite></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACLC%20138" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 ACLC 138</a>, a decision of the Full
Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia, provides a strong reason for
continuing to follow it and to
leave it to an appeal court to determine that
such action is wrong.  The position might have been different had the decision
of the
House of Lords been essential for its upholding the decision of the
English Court of Appeal, but it was not, and seems partly at
least to have been
brought about through a desire to make the law accord with the desires of
commerce rather than through totally
convincing reasoning.  In all these
circumstances I have decided that I should follow the decision in
<b><cite>Broad</cite></b>.  I should add that I relisted the matter and sought
further submissions as to whether different considerations applied to charged
deposits, which could be traced to have come from assets which were themselves
subject to charge.  I got no real help from this,
but some assistance is gained
from the speeches of Lord Dilhorne and Lord Cross of Chelsea in
<b><cite>National Westminster Bank v Halesowen Presswork</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%201%20AC%20785" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] 1 AC
785.</a>  Both Law Lords approved the following passage from the judgment of
Buckley LJ in the Court of Appeal  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%201%20QB%2033" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 1 QB 33</a> at 46:
<P>

When the cheque was cleared, as it was on June 14, 1968, it ceased to be a
negotiable instrument and also ceased to be in the possession
of the bank.  Any
lien of the bank on the cheque must thereupon have come to an end. ... The
money or credit which the bank obtained
as the result of clearing the cheque
became the property of the bank, not the property of the company.  No man can
have a lien on
his own property and consequently no lien can have arisen
affecting that money or that credit.
<P>

It would follow from this that if the <b><cite>Broad</cite></b> "principle"
exists it does so in such circumstances.  For the reasons given I consider I
should follow it.
<P>

<b>Set Off</b>
<P>

30   	It is necessary only to deal with the second transaction
in view of my conclusions as to security on the first.  And it should
be borne
in mind that it is only if I am correct in continuing to follow the decision of
<b><cite>Broad</cite></b> in the face of the decision of the House of Lords in
<b><cite>Bank of Credit and Commerce International (No. 8)</cite></b> that set
off need be considered in relation to the second transaction.
<P>

31   	The second transaction took place on 3 July 1990.  The
winding up commenced on that day.  There is no evidence which would
enable me
to determine which event took place first.  There is no reason why I should
find that one order was more probable than
the other.  However, if either event
would lead to the same result there is no reason to deny the plaintiff the
benefit of the result.
 In this case either event would lead to the same result
but that result does not bring a benefit to the plaintiff.
<P>

32   	If the transaction took place after the winding up
commenced then on the basis of the decision of the House of Lords in
<b><cite>Stein v Blake</cite></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1995/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] UKHL 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20AC%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] AC 243</a> and followed in that House in
<b><cite>Bank of Credit and Commerce International (No. 8)</cite></b> at 223 an
automatic set off takes place at the commencement of the winding up to produce
a balance due one way or the other.  This
is supported by the following passage
in <b><cite>Gye v McIntyre</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/60.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 60</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20171%20CLR%20609" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 171 CLR 609</a> at 622:
<P>

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 86</a> is a statutory directive ("shall be set off") which operates as at
the time the bankruptcy takes effect.  It produces a balance upon
the basis of
which the bankruptcy administration can proceed.  Only that balance can be
claimed in the bankruptcy or recovered by
the trustee.  If its operation is to
produce a nil balance, its effect will be that there is nothing at all which
can be claimed
in the bankruptcy or recovered in proceedings by the trustee.
The section is  self-executing in the sense that its operation is automatic
and
not dependent upon "the option of either party" (see, per Lord Selborne LC.,
<b><cite>In re Deveze; Ex parte Barnett</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281874%29%209%20LRCh%20App%20293" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1874) 9 Ch App 293</a>, at p
295).
<P>

In the circumstances of this case the views expressed in <b><cite>Re Capel
Marac Finance Australia Ltd v Capel</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1994/890.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] FCA 890</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2048%20FCR%20195" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 48 FCR 195</a> as to
self-execution at bankruptcy date need not be considered as RAL has in effect
taken advantage of the security the right of
set off gave.
<P>

33   	If the transaction took place prior to the commencement of
the winding up then as it took place on the same day as the winding
up
commenced, the position is that had it not taken place, set off would have been
available so that the payment did not have the
effect of giving RAL preference
over other creditors.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 122(1)(a)</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act 1966</a></u>.
The position of RAL and the other creditors was precisely the same.  This is
explained in the judgment of Hodgson J in <b><cite>Hamilton v Commercial Bank
of Australia</cite></b> (1992) 9 ACSR 90 at 106 to 108.
<P>

34   	It is nevertheless still necessary to consider <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">s86(2)</a> of
the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a></u> and thus to consider whether, at the time of
receiving credit from AUR, RAL had notice of any act or omission of the company
which
would give ground for an application to wind up the company under s364 of
the Code:  <b><cite>Law v Jones</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%202%20NSWLR%20573" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] 2 NSWLR 573.</a>  In the
circumstances of this case that would mean notice that the company was unable
to pay its debts.
<P>

35   	There is of course no suggestion that at the time of
entering into the second gold loan AUR was unable to pay its debts. 
The
question is whether at the time of receiving credit from AUR by payment or
deposit into the blocked account, RAL had knowledge
AUR was unable to pay its
debts.  There is no evidence that was the position on 18 June 1990.  No
questions were asked of the witnesses
for the defendant about this.  The notice
of default in respect of the larger gold loan and the calling on the letter of
credit securing
it took place at the end of June 1990.  Counsel for the
defendant argued that the mutual dealings were the gold loans and the hedging
contracts.  I do not accept that to be the position.  The credit under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">s86(2)</a>
in this case was the deposit into the blocked account.  But even on that basis
as I have said, there is no evidence that RAL had
knowledge AUR was unable to
pay its debts.  Had it been in possession of that knowledge it is more likely
than not it would have
required all proceeds from the hedging contracts to be
used towards repayment of the gold loan.  Insofar as cases such a
<b><cite>Naoroji v The Standard Chartered Bank of India</cite></b> [1868] LR 3
CD 444; and <b><cite>National Safety Council v Lloyds Bank NZ Ltd </cite></b>
(1992) 7 ACSR 286 state the object of the forerunners of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">s86</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy
Act</a> to have been to bring about a fair result where merchants have mutual
dealings, each giving credit to the other, relying on the solvency
of the
other, that statement of reliance is I consider now covered by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">s86(2)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a>.  It is to be remembered that RAL considered it had security
over the deposit.  No secured creditor is bound to give partial release
whether
or not the creditor considers the debtor solvent.
<P>

36   	It follows the claims of the plaintiff in respect of each
transaction fails and that the appropriate order is that the plaintiffs'
claim
be dismissed with costs.
