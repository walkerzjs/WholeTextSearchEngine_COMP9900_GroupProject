<b>JUDGMENT (See T2152 - admissibility of evidence - post-publication
reputation)</b>
<P>

 
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  Yesterday Mr Lyall was asked a series of
questions recorded at page 2120 relating to the impact of the publications
upon
the plaintiff's reputation amongst members of the legal profession.  The
questions and answers set out at lines 49 to 56 on
page 2120 were struck out by
me (see page 2122.50), by reason of the observations of Hunt J in <b><i>Hughes
v Fairfax Newspapers Limited </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20NSWLR%20504" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 NSWLR 504.</a>
<P>

2   	Mr Donohoe has indicated that it is his intention and wish
to ask Mr Lyall when he returns to the witness box a question to
the effect:
What is the plaintiff's reputation now?  Mr Donohoe's arguments have been
recorded but they involve, shortly stated,
an analysis of what Hunt J said in
<b><i>Hughes</i></b> that would lead to the conclusion that nothing his Honour
there said at pages 512 to 513 can be understood as excluding as a matter
of
principle, or as a matter of logic in terms of relevance under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence
Act</a>, </i>evidence of this kind.  The more so, it is said, when the submission
is made that conformably with what his Honour said, it was open
to a plaintiff
to call evidence of being shunned, that, it is argued, being consistent with
the reputation of the plaintiff being
damaged.  A phrase I use advisably.
<P>

3   	The matter was dealt with with remarkable brevity
yesterday.  
<P>

4   	I am of the view that the substance of the question sought
now to be asked is the same as that was put in the series yesterday.
 It is
desirable to repeat what Windeyer J said in<b> <i>Uren v John Fairfax and Sons
Pty Ltd</i> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281965%2d6%29%20117%20CLR%20118" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1965-6) 117 CLR, 118</a> at 150 as to what the rationale and
character of damages in a defamation action are.
<P>

5   	His Honour said in a passage well-known and where juries
are still involved, paraphrased for the purposes of summing-up the
following:

<P>

<i>"When it is said that in an action for defamation damages are given for an
injury to the plaintiff's reputation, what is meant?  A
man's reputation, his
good name, the estimation in which he is held in the opinion of others, is not
a possession of his as a chattel
is.  Damage to it cannot be measured as harm
to a tangible thing is measured.  Apart from special damages strictly so called
and
damages for a loss of clients or customers, money and reputation are not
commensurables.  It seems to me that, properly speaking,
a man defamed does not
get compensation for his damaged reputation.  He gets damages because he was
injured in his reputation, that
is simply because he was publicly defamed.  For
this reason, compensation by damages operates in two ways - as a vindication of
the
plaintiff to the public and as consolation to him for a wrong done.
Compensation is here a solatium rather than a monetary recompense
for harm
measurable in  money".</i>
<P>

6   	It can be seen from what his Honour said that the focus, as
Mr Nicholas put it, is the commission of the tort and the time
of the
commission of the tort, the commission of which at the time it happens then
injures a plaintiff in his reputation.  It is
because that has happened that
compensation operates in the way Windeyer J describes it. The temporal notion
is emphasised by McHugh
J in<b> <i>Carson v John Fairfax and Sons
Limited</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/31.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 31</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20178%20CLR%2044" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 178 CLR 44</a> at page 101.
<P>

7   	Hunt J in <b><i>Hughes</i></b> was at pains, as his Honour
said, to ensure that his Honour's judgment in that case did not become
authority to support the admissibility
of evidence which in my view is captured
by what his Honour there said.
<P>

8   	Whilst the decision I gave yesterday was a ruling on
evidence and it is open to me upon further submissions to reconsider or
consider afresh any ruling I have given, I am not persuaded that when one takes
into account the rationale of the function of damages
in defamation actions
enunciated by Windeyer J in the<b> <i>Uren</i> </b>case that there is a basis
in principle or relevance for admitting it as submitted by Mr Donohoe and I
disallow the question.
