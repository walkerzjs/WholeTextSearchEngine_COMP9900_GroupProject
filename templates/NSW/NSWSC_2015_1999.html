<p><b>JUDGMENT &#8211; EX TEMPORE</b></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='1' value="1">By
Originating Process filed on 6 August 2015, the Applicant, Ms Amanda Ledermann,
applies under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s601ah.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 601AH(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporations Act</i> 2001</a> (Cth) for an order
that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC") reinstate the
registration of MC Insulation
Pty Ltd (In liquidation) (&#8220;Company&#8221;).
By a further order made today, Mr Anthony Warner, who was formerly one of the
two
persons appointed as liquidator of the company prior to its deregistration,
has been joined, with his consent, as a Second Applicant
in the application. Mr
Warner has indicated that he consents to being appointed as liquidator, if the
Company is reinstated.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='2' value="2">The
application is supported by an affidavit of Ms Ledermann dated 3 August 2015. Ms
Ledermann indicates that she was a shareholder
in the Company prior to its
liquidation, and the Company conducted an insulation business from its
incorporation in December 2007
until it was placed in liquidation in December
2011. She refers to Mr Warner having been appointed, with Mr Kugel, as
liquidators
of the Company. She notes that the Company was deregistered by ASIC
on 1 May 2013 under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s509.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 509</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporations Act</a></i>, which provides for
deregistration of a company after a final meeting, when the company&#8217;s
affairs are fully wound up. Ms Ledermann
also refers to her husband's role with
the company, and the fact that he had been made bankrupt by reason of a personal
guarantee
to one of the creditors of the Company. Ms Ledermann notes that the
Company experienced severe financial difficulties when the then
Federal
Government disbanded the Home Insulation Scheme in February 2010, and she notes
that the current Federal Government has instituted
a Home Insulation Programme
Industry Payment Scheme to provide financial recompense to businesses which were
adversely affected as
a result of the Home Insulation Scheme. Ms Ledermann
annexes a printout from the Department of Industry and Science website relating
to the scheme, although that printout is not sufficiently detailed to provide a
clear understanding of the terms of such compensation,
or the basis on which it
will be calculated. By an application made on 20 June 2015, Mr Ledermann had
lodged an application for compensation
under that scheme, and Ms Ledermann
refers to advice received from the Department of Industry and Science that the
application will
be held open until 30 September to allow the Company to be
reinstated.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='3' value="3">Ms
Ledermann made the application in her capacity as a contributory of the Company.
She identified the basis on which she contended
she was aggrieved by the
deregistration, by reference to its effect upon her and her husband's financial
affairs. The adverse impact
of the deregistration upon Ms Ledermann might be put
more precisely, so far as the deregistration of the Company would prevent it
lodging a claim under the compensation scheme, for the benefit of its creditors
or contributories. Plainly, Ms Ledermann would only
benefit financially from
such a claim, if the amount of compensation paid was sufficient to discharge the
claims of creditors, leaving
a surplus for contributories. However, it might be
recognised that Ms Ledermann may also have an entirely proper interest in
discharging
the claims of creditors, albeit that she might not benefit
financially from that course.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='4' value="4">By
a further affidavit sworn 27 August 2015, Mr Warner indicates that he had been
appointed as liquidator of the Company, together
with Mr Kugel who has since
ceased to practice. He expresses the view, not surprisingly, that he considers
that it will be in the
interests of the Company's creditors, and the owners of
the Company as at the date of its deregistration, that the Company be
reinstated.
That proposition seems to me to be plainly correct, where
reinstatement of the Company would permit it to bring a claim for compensation,
which may have some prospect of success which might otherwise not be available
to it. Mr Warner confirms his willingness to be joined
in the application as an
applicant, as has now occurred, and he indicates that he has executed a further
consent to act as official
liquidator.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='5' value="5">There
is also evidence of service of the application on ASIC by letter dated 12 August
2015. Ms Ledermann's solicitor indicates that
he has since been advised by ASIC,
in a telephone conversation following an inquiry that he made, that ASIC will
not provide a written
response but will leave it to the Court to make a decision
on the application. In those circumstances, it seems to me that Ms Ledermann
has
done all that she can properly do to bring the matter to ASIC's attention and
allow it an opportunity to be heard.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='6' value="6"><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s601ah.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section
601AH(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporations Act</a></i> provides that the Court may make an
order that ASIC reinstate the registration of a company if an application for
reinstatement is
made by a person aggrieved by the reregistration, or a former
liquidator of the company, and the Court is satisfied that it is just
that the
company's registration be reinstated. The effect of an order for reinstatement
is that the company is taken to have continued
in existence as if it had not
been deregistered, and, where the company was in liquidation, a further
liquidator will need to be
appointed. I will return to that question below. The
first element of an application under the section is that the applicant is a
person aggrieved, and the second is that the Court is satisfied that it is just
that the company's registration be reinstated.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='7' value="7">It
seems to me that it is arguable that Ms Ledermann is, herself, a person
aggrieved by the deregistration, to the extent that it
would deprive the
Company, of which she is a contributory, of its ability to make a claim under
the compensation scheme. It is arguable
that Ms Ledermann is aggrieved by that
matter, even if she would not financially benefit from such a claim, if she
considers that
it would be a proper matter for the Company to seek compensation
for the benefit of its creditors, even if she would not financially
benefit from
that result. In any event, it is not necessary to reach a final determination
about that matter because Ms Ledermann
has prudently enlisted the former
liquidator as a further applicant, and it is plain that the former liquidator
has a standing to
bring the application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s601ah.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 601AH(2)</a> of the <i>Act</i>. I am
therefore satisfied that the application is properly brought, by a person who
has standing to bring it.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='8' value="8">The
next question is whether it is just that the Company be reinstated. Relevant
matters include the future activities of the Company
if an order is made, and
whether any person is likely to be prejudiced by the reinstatement:
<i>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and
Investments Commission </i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2000/316.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2000] NSWSC 316</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282000%29%20174%20ALR%20688" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2000) 174 ALR 688</a> at  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2000/316.html#para27" class="autolink_findcases">[27]</a>;
<i>Wedgwood Hallam Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission Re
Combined Building Consultants Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2011/439.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2011] FCA 439</a> at  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2011/439.html#para5" class="autolink_findcases">[5]</a>. In this case,
it seems to me that it is plainly just and equitable that the Company be
reinstated, so far as it will allow it an
opportunity to pursue a claim for
compensation as to which it would otherwise be unable to bring, where that claim
of compensation
may benefit its creditors and, potentially, its contributories.
To put it another way, it would be an unjust result if, by reason
of the
Company's deregistration, it were shut out of pursuing a claim for compensation
to which it would otherwise be properly entitled.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='9' value="9">The
remaining question, which causes little difficulty in this matter, is the effect
of reinstatement, so far as a liquidator of the
Company was formally in office.
The balance of authority supports the view that the reinstatement of a company
does not automatically
result in the reappointment of a liquidator who was in
office at the time of the company's deregistration, but the Court may appoint
a
liquidator with effect from the company's reinstatement: see, for example, <i>JP
Morgan Portfolio Services Ltd v Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2008/433.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2008] FCA 433</a>;
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282008%29%2065%20ACSR%20636" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2008) 65 ACSR 636</a> at  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2008/433.html#para6" class="autolink_findcases">[6]</a>- <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2008/433.html#para7" class="autolink_findcases">[7]</a> and the other cases cited in <i>Austin &amp;
Black's Annotations to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporations Act</a></i> [5A.601AH]. The case law has
recognised that, all things being equal, it will generally be preferable that
the liquidator who was
in office at the time of the deregistration be
reappointed. In this case, that is not practicable or desirable so far as Mr
Kugel
is concerned, where he has ceased to practice, but it is practicable and
desirable to appoint Mr Warner, one of the Company's former
liquidators, as
liquidator from the point of the Company's reinstatement. Mr Warner will, of
course, have the advantage of some knowledge
of the Company's affairs, and have
knowledge of its creditors, which is likely to be a matter relevant to any claim
for compensation.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='10' value="10">In
these circumstances, I am satisfied that the orders sought by the applicants
should be made. Accordingly, I make the following
orders:</li></ol><p>1.
   Order pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s601ah.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 601AH(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporations Act
2001</a> (Cth) that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission reinstate
the registration of the company MC Insulation Pty Limited
(in liquidation) (ACN
129 012 362).</p>
<p>2.    Order that Mr Anthony John Warner be appointed as
liquidator of the company with effect from the reinstatement.</p>
