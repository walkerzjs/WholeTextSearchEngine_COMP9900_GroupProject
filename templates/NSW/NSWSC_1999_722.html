<b>100288/97 - THE PUBLIC TRUSTEE V PERMANENT TRUSTEE COMPANY LIMITED;  ESTATE
OF MEH TIAP RINTOUL</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR :  </b>Meh<b> </b>Tiap Rintoul died on 24
August 1992 in the Gosford District Hospital.  She died suddenly, as a result
of an accident.   Her last address
was 366 Ocean Beach Road, Umina. 
<P>

2   	Mrs Rintoul had been married to Robert Humfrey Rintoul who
died on 24 December 1978.  According to Mr Rintoul's death certificate,
he was
born in Scotland and married Meh Tiap Rintoul in Malaysia in 1947 and was a
solicitor by occupation.  He had moved to Australia
in 1968.  
<P>

3   	Mr  Rintoul was a partner in a law firm in Kuala Lumpur,
Shearn Delamore &amp; Co.  The firm is still practising in that city.
<P>

4   	Mrs Rintoul died with assets in Malaysia and Singapore as
well as assets in NSW to the value of about $1.2 million. 
<P>

5   	On 25 August 1980, Mrs Rintoul made a will, probate of
which was granted in common form to the defendant on 28 October 1992.
<P>

6   	On 19 July 1994, the High Court of Malaysia granted probate
to Dato Khoo and Dato Kandan, two Malaysian attorneys, partners
in Shearn
Delamore &amp; Co, the probate being of a will of Mrs Rintoul dated 22 February
1989.
<P>

7   	It would seem clear that although Mrs Rintoul lived
permanently in Australia she did, from time to time, visit Malaysia and
she was
in Malaysia between 7 January and 24 February 1989.
<P>

8   	Upon the defendant becoming aware of the will of which the
Malaysian court granted probate, discussions ensued amongst the
beneficiaries
under the two wills.  Following the failure of those discussions the Public
Trustee commenced these present proceedings
on 10 January 1997.  The
proceedings are for revocation of the common form grant and for a grant of
administration cta of the will
of 22 February 1989.
<P>

9   	Although at one stage capacity was at issue, Mr Harris of
counsel, who appeared for the defendant, indicated that after due
research that
defence had been abandoned so that the issues before me are due execution and
knowledge of approval in respect of the
1989 will.
<P>

10   	Mr Blackburn-Hart, for the plaintiff, said that his
application was made under s 75 of the Wills <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Act
1898</a>, or alternatively, under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/s74.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74.</a> 
<P>

11   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 75</a> is a rather peculiar section.  It first came
into the law of NSW as s 46 of the Probate Act 1890.  Its genesis is the
Victorian Probate
Act 1872.  This Victorian Act was one of the first secular
Probate Acts and at least in part, sought to introduce more straightforward
procedures than those used in the ecclesiastical courts in England.
<P>

12   	On a literal reading of the section, the Public Trustee or
any other person referred to in the section, might obtain an order
that probate
be granted to the executor named in the will despite the opposition of that
executor.  That cannot be what the section
means because it was obviously
intended to be a procedural provision and in no way to affect one of the
primary rules in probate
that an executor cannot be forced to take a grant (see
Williams and Mortimer, <b>Executors Administrators and Probate </b>(Stevens,
London, 1970) p 34).  What the section does mean is that the Public Trustee or
other named persons may commence proceedings
in which the named executor is a
party to give that person one last chance of taking the grant, but the court
cannot make an order
that that person be granted probate without his or her
consent.  If there is no consent, then the order that must be made is for
administration with the will annexed to be granted to the applicant or some
other appropriate person who is a party to the proceedings.
<P>

13   	There is no problem with an application under s 75 in the
instant case as of the two Malaysian executors named in the will,
one has died
and the other is quite content for the Public Trustee to take a grant, he
himself saying that he took on the executorship
out of respect for the late Mr
Rintoul and has no particular desire to take Australian administration.
<P>

14   	As the case falls within s 75, it is unnecessary to
consider s 74.
<P>

15   	The will was prepared by Shearn Delamore &amp; Co.
Exactly how it came to be prepared is unclear but a number of the details
leading up to the execution appear from the evidence.
<P>

16   	It would seem that at the time the 1989 will was made, Mrs
Rintoul was having some difficulties with her daughter Margaret,
who is now
deceased.  She called in at Shearn Delamore &amp; Co and spoke to Dato Khoo,
one of the senior partners.  Dato Khoo (who
is now deceased) made an affidavit
in these proceedings stating that the testatrix told him about her problem with
Margaret and said
that she would like to make a new will.  Dato Khoo said "The
deceased then proceeded to discuss with me her thoughts and intentions
in words
the exact nature of which I do not recollect.  In turn I told her that I would
introduce her to other solicitors in our
office who worked in that area, namely
Mrs Petrus and Miss Goh Bee Chen of that section in our office."
<P>

17   	Dato Khoo said that Mrs Rintoul did speak clear coherent
English and he conversed with her in English, Malay and the Hokien
dialect of
Chinese, all of which she understood well.  Goh Bee Chen (Dr Goh) is now an
academic lawyer teaching at Bond University
in Queensland.  Dr Goh filed an
affidavit and also gave oral evidence.  She said that Shearn Delamore &amp; Co
was organised into
various departments and one department over which a senior
partner, Mrs Menon, presided dealt with conveyancing, banking, probate
and
administration.  The principal work done by the department appears to be
mortgage debentures, but some probate work was done.
 Dr Goh said that she had
only ever drafted one will, but that she had been called in on many occasions
to be the second witness
to a will.
<P>

18   	I recite this evidence at this stage because it does seem
to me that it is probably reconstruction on Dato Khoo's part that
he introduced
the testatrix to Dr Goh.  Dr Goh was principally working on banking documents
rather than probate.  It seems to me
more likely than not that Dato Khoo merely
mentioned Dr Goh because she was one of the witnesses of the will.  
<P>

19   	This is reinforced by a letter of 16 September 1997 which
Dato Khoo wrote to Dr Goh (PX09).  It would seem that Dr Goh had
been asked to
file an affidavit in these proceedings and she wrote to Dato Khoo to the effect
that she really couldn't remember anything
apart from the fact that her
signature clearly appeared on the will as a witness.  In PX09, Dato Khoo wrote
"I knew Meh Tiap well
and recall discussing the details of this will with her
before asking Shantini to do the Will as referred to for execution".  The
letter was written about four months before Dato Khoo swore his affidavit.
<P>

20   	Mrs Shantini Petrus swore an affidavit and also gave oral
evidence.  She is still practising in Malaysia as a lawyer.  She
said that she
could not remember anything about this will at all, but she obviously had
signed it as a witness.  She had dated the
will.  This was significant because
Dr Goh said the only will that she had ever drawn she, Dr Goh, had dated
herself, and as her
handwriting was not in the date section, she was fairly
clear that she had not drafted it.
<P>

21   	Mrs Petrus said that it was her standard practice to read
over the will line by line to the testator and then when she was
satisfied that
the testator understood it, call in a second solicitor from the firm to witness
the will.  Mrs Petrus was trained
in England and had been with the firm for a
few years, though at the time the will was drawn had relatively recently been
assigned
to Mrs Menon's department.  Mrs Petrus said that she could speak some
Bahasa, but not enough to converse with a client.  She said
her practice was,
whenever the client was not well versed in the English language, to call
somebody from the firm who could speak
the client's language to help her
explain each line of the will to the client.
<P>

22   	Mrs Menon gave evidence both by affidavit and orally.  She
said that it was her custom to train the lawyers in her department
in the
procedures for executing a will and that training included telling the
solicitors in her section to read the will out aloud
to the client, to ask
whether he or she understood it, and to ask whether it complied with his or her
wishes and instructions.  Where
a will was prepared for an illiterate testator,
it was always to be read to them fully in the language in which they were
conversant.
 An interpreter would be called in on occasions when the drafter
was not conversant in the language of the testator.
<P>

23   	Dr Goh, Mrs Petrus and Mrs Menon were all cross examined
before me and all appeared to be competent, intelligent lawyers of
the highest
integrity.
<P>

24   	Although none of the lawyers could remember who drafted
the will, it seems to me more likely than not that its was Mrs Petrus.
 Dr Goh
did not believe she had drafted it as she had not dated it, Mrs Petrus was more
involved in the probate side of the department
than Dr Goh, Mrs Petrus had
dated the will and Dato Khoo remembered referring the will to Mrs Petrus in his
letter to Dr Goh.  Mr
Harris puts that anyone could have drafted the will.  It
may have been another lawyer altogether.  That is certainly a possibility,
but
when one is looking at what is more likely than not, in my view it is more
likely than not that Mrs Petrus drafted the will.
<P>

25   	Mr Blackburn-Hart notes the evidence that the 1989 will
was found in the safe deposit box of the testatrix on her death. 
He says that
this is the very place one would expect the testatrix to put a document which
she considered to be her last will.  This
adds to the strength of the
presumption of due execution:  see <b>Hendy v Jenkins </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1901/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1901] NSWStRp 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281901%29%2018%20WN%20%28NSW%29%20140" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1901) 18 WN (NSW)
140</a>, 143 and 145.
<P>

26   	Mr Blackburn-Hart says that the case is clear.  The
testatrix went to the firm with which her husband had been associated,
she gave
details of the will she wanted to Dato Khoo, she was introduced to the people
who normally drafted wills in the firm, the
will was drafted for her, it was
read over and explained to her by Mrs Petrus in accordance with her usual
practice, and then witnessed
before two solicitors.  Finally, it was found in
the testatrix's safe deposit box on her death.
<P>

27   	Mr Harris says that the case is not that simple, and
indeed, when the evidence is properly examined, it will be seen that
this is a
case where the plaintiff has not shown that this is a will which was duly
executed by a testatrix who knew and approved
of what was in the will.
<P>

28   	To support his submission, Mr Harris relies on a number of
factors.  First he says that the testatrix was unable to speak
English to any
real extent.  Secondly, she could not read nor write English.  Thirdly, her
vision was very poor.  Fourthly, the will
shows mistakes which would almost
certainly have been corrected had it been read over to her.  Fifthly, there is
some suggestion
that the testatrix intended to deal with her real property in
Umina by giving it to her daughter which did not make its way into
the will.
Sixthly,  evidence as to Mrs Petrus' usual practice must take a secondary role
in the light of the other factors.
<P>

29   	It is certainly true that the testatrix could not read nor
write English.  However, on the balance of probabilities, she was
able to speak
English and to understand spoken English.  Although there is some evidence the
other way, the preponderance of the
evidence points in this direction.  In
particular, Dato Khoo said he had had no difficulty in understanding the
English that the
testatrix spoke, though some of his conversations with her
were in other languages, but more significantly, two Australian ladies
who
lived near the testatrix at Umina spent time conversing with her and had had no
difficulty understanding or being understood,
even though they did not speak a
word of any other language.  The evidence of these ladies, Mrs Pierce and Mrs
Harrison, was clear
and obviously truthful.  Dr Mala, the testatrix's doctor, a
lady of Indian origin whose first language is English, also had no difficulty
in understanding the testatrix who was her patient over many years.
<P>

30   	It is true that the testatrix had limited vision.  She had
had an eye operation on one eye about the relevant time and there
were problems
with the vision in the other eye.  As, however, the testatrix could not read
English in any event, I cannot see how
this is a relevant factor in the
case.
<P>

31   	The principal mistake to which Mr Harris alludes is that
the will suggests that the testatrix owned "my house known as No
24 Harriet
Street, West End, QLD Brisbane" whereas in fact that house was owned by the
testatrix's daughter Margaret (the testatrix
purported to give the house to
Margaret by the will).  
<P>

32   	There is some basis for the submission that the testatrix
might have thought she owned the property, but it is more probable
that there
was a breakdown in communications between the testatrix and the drafter of the
will.  This is a significant matter.
<P>

33   	There is another matter concerning the text of the will
which is unusual.  The residuary gifts in clause 5 of the will are
to "(i) the
Cancer Hospital in Sydney, Australia, (ii) the Presbyterian Church in Sydney,
Australia (iii) 	the Tuberculosis Hospital
in Sydney Australia".
<P>

34   	The 1980 will contained a gift to the NSW State Cancer
Council.  The thought crossed my mind that the word "Hospital" in the
first
residuary gift might have been a result of mishearing the word "Council" and
this might be significant.  However, I discarded
this thought as mere
speculation. 
<P>

35   	The fact that two of the three organisations given
residuary bequests are so vaguely and inexactly named excites suspicion
that
there was insufficient checking and that the testatrix did not understand what
was read over to her, if indeed anything was
so read.
<P>

36   	Of course, these errors can be explained on hypotheses
other than that the will was not read over to the testatrix as claimed
by Mrs
Petrus.  As Mr Blackburn-Hart said in his submissions, there is many a will
which was properly executed but in which the charities
are misdescribed.
However, the mere fact that the mistakes were made is a fact against there
being knowledge and approval.
<P>

37   	The 1980 will gave the Umina property to Margaret.  The
omission of any reference to it in the 1989 will is a little unusual
as it
would appear to be the testatrix's most significant asset. However, as she was
in some dispute with her daughter Margaret,
to whom this property had been left
in the 1980 will, the omission is not so singular as to cast doubt on the 1989
will. 
<P>

38   	These submissions then throw up a point on the onus of
proof which was debated at some length before me.  Mr Blackburn-Hart
says that
it is not uncommon for the witnesses to the will not to remember anything about
it and this is a fortiori the case when
the will is prepared by solicitors in a
legal office who have no connection with the testatrix other than a
professional one.  On
the other hand, Mr Harris says that the rule clearly is
that where there are suspicious circumstances, the person propounding the
will
must actually prove that the will is that of a testatrix who knew and approved
its contents when she executed it.
<P>

39   	I was referred to some leading cases in the area.  In
<b>Nock v Austin</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1918/73.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1918] HCA 73</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281918%29%2025%20CLR%20519" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1918) 25 CLR 519</a>, 528, Isaacs J set out various general
propositions that apply in this area of the law.  Omitting references to
authorities, the
relevant propositions were as follows:
<P>

"1.	In general, where there appears no circumstance exciting suspicion that the
provisions of the instrument may not have been fully
known to and approved by
the testator, the mere proof of his capacity and of the fact of due execution
of the instrument creates
an assumption that he knew of and assented to its
contents. 
<P>

2.	Where any such suspicious circumstances exist, the assumption does not
arise, and the proponents have the burden of removing
the suspicion by proving
affirmatively by clear and satisfactory proof that the testator knew and
approved of the contents of the
document.
<P>

3.	...	
<P>

4.	The circumstance that a party who takes a benefit wrote or prepared the will
is one which should generally arouse suspicion and
call for the vigilant and
anxious examination by the Court of the evidence as to the testator's
appreciation and approval of the
contents of the will.
<P>

5.	But the rule does not go further than requiring vigilance in seeing that the
case is fully proved.  It does not introduce a disqualification.
<P>

6.	Nor does the rule require as a matter of law any particular species of proof
to satisfy the onus."
<P>

40   	Mr Blackburn-Hart emphasises proposition 5 in <b>Nock v
Austin</b>.  The rule only calls for vigilance.
<P>

41   	Mr Blackburn-Hart relied on <b>Re Fenwick </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1972/75.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1972] VicRp 75</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20VR%20646" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] VR
646</a> where at 651-5, Menhennitt J sets out the basal propositions.  His first
and fifth propositions are:
<P>

"1.	The due execution of a will raises a presumption that the testator approved
of its contents.
<P>

5.	Where it is established that a will has been read by or to a testator, the
presumption that the testator knew and approved of
the contents of the will is
a very strong one and can be rebutted only by the clearest statement."
<P>

42   	Proposition 5 in <b>Re Fenwick </b>is supported by
<b>Gregson v Taylor </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1917%5d%20P%20256" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1917] P 256</a>, 261.  Menhennitt J made it clear that
"clearest statement" was not as high as "beyond reasonable doubt".
<P>

43   	There are a host of cases in this general area of the law.
There is no need to consider them all.  I will merely mention that
Mr
Blackburn-Hart did rely on the way Helsham J stated the law in <b>Astridge v
Pepper </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%201%20NSWR%20542" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] 1 NSWR 542.</a>
<P>

44   	In <b>Re Estate of Hodges </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20698" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 14 NSWLR 698</a>, 705,
Powell J set out various propositions applicable in this type of case,
propositions 9 and 10 of which are as follows:
<P>

"9.	Unless suspicion attaches to the document propounded, the testator's
execution of it is sufficient evidence of his knowledge
and approval;   
<P>

10.	Facts which may well cause suspicion to attach to a document include:  (a)
that the person who prepared, or procured the execution
of, the document
receives a benefit under it;  (b)   that the testator was enfeebled, illiterate
or blind when he executed the document;
 (c)  when the testator executes the
document as a marksman when he is not."
<P>

45   	There was argument that Powell J's proposition 10(b) meant
that whenever one had an illiterate testator one had circumstances
of suspicion
and therefore there was a heavier burden on the propounder.  
<P>

46   	With respect, I do not consider that that submission is
correct.
<P>

47   	The authorities referred to by Powell J in connection with
his proposition 10(b) are <b>Tyrrell v Painton </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1894%5d%20P%20151" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1894] P 151</a> and <b>Kenny v
Wilson </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1911/73.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1911] NSWStRp 73</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281911%29%2011%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20460" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1911) 11 SR (NSW) 460</a>, 469.
<P>

48   	In <b>Tyrrell's case</b>, Lindley LJ said at p 157 that
the rule that the court must examine wills made in suspicious circumstances "is
not, in my opinion,
confined to the single case in which a will is prepared by
or on the instructions of the person taking large benefits under it, but
extends to all cases in which circumstances exist which excite the suspicion of
the Court ...".
<P>

49   	In <b>Kenny's case</b>, as shown in the judgment of Rich
AJ at p 469, there were a multitude of factors leading to suspicion including
the age and moribund
condition of the deceased, death supervening within six
hours after execution as well as being executed by the deceased as a marksman
although he was not a marksman.
<P>

50   	Lindley LJ's statement in <b>Tyrrell's case </b>was
examined by Willmer J in <b>Re R </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1951%5d%20P%2010" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1951] P 10</a>, 17.  His Lordship there said
of <b>Tyrrell's case </b>"Lindley LJ however, went on to make it clear that the
circumstances to which he was referring must be circumstances attending the
preparation or execution of the will ... ."  Willmer J said that the real
principle is summed up in the judgment of Davey LJ in <b>Tyrrell's case </b>at
p 159 viz, "the principle is, that whenever a will is prepared under
circumstances which raise a well-grounded suspicion that it
does not express
the mind of the testator, the court ought not to pronounce in favour of it
unless the suspicion is removed."
<P>

51   	Willmer J then summarized the law by saying,  "The
conclusion which I draw from these authorities... is that, when it is a
question of knowledge and approval of the contents of a will the circumstances
which are held to excite the suspicions of the court
must be circumstances
attending, or at least relevant to, the preparation and execution of the will
itself."  He said that this view
was confirmed by <b>Davis v Mayhew </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1927%5d%20P%20264" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1927]
P 264</a>, where, in the words of Willmer J "...it was held that a suspicion
engendered by extraneous circumstances, arising subsequent to
the execution of
the will, was not a sufficient reason for rebutting the presumption of due
execution of a will regular upon its
face."
<P>

52   	<b>Re R </b>is also authority for the proposition that the
circumstance that the deceased was a person of weak mind does not in itself
amount
to a circumstance to arouse suspicion, see p 15 and also <b>Barry v
Butlin </b><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1838/1056.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1838] EngR 1056</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281838%29%202%20Moore%20PC%20480" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1838) 2 Moore PC 480</a>, 487;   <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1838/1056.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1838] EngR 1056</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=12%20ER%201089" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">12 ER 1089</a>, 1092.
<P>

53   	Mr Harris cites the New Zealand case of <b>Re Clayton
</b> <a href="http://www.nzlii.org/nz/cases/NZGazLawRp/1906/33.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1906) 8 GLR 516</a> for the proposition that the mere fact of illiteracy is
sufficient to arouse suspicion.  However, in that case, there was more than
mere illiteracy to indicate that further enquiry was needed.  <b>Clayton's case
</b>is based on a passage from Tristram and Coote's <b>Probate Practice</b>
which in turn comes from Rule 71 of the English Probate Rules of 1862 (see
Tristram and Coote, 19th ed (Butterworths, London, 1946)
p 946). <b> </b>There
is no corresponding rule in NSW.
<P>

54   	It thus seems to me that the mere fact that the testatrix
was illiterate is not a circumstance which by itself would arouse
suspicion.
<P>

55   	However, the combined effect of the illiteracy, the fact
that the attestation clause does not mention that the will was read
over, the
mistake as to the Brisbane house and the vague names given to the residuary
beneficiaries indicates that there could well
be insufficient checking between
the time of the instructions and the time of execution.  This in turn means
that the court should
examine the validity of this will more closely than
others where there was nothing at all to excite suspicion.
<P>

56   	Putting those thoughts aside for a moment and turning to a
different matter, the fact is that probate was granted of the 1989
will in
Malaysia and the Malaysian probate was resealed in Singapore. 
<P>

57   	There is some difficulty in determining where the
testatrix was domiciled.  There are insufficient facts to make the
determination
and it is unnecessary to do so in any event.  The testatrix had
lived in Australia for many many years and would appear to have made
Australia
her permanent home, but on the other hand she did go back to Malaysia from time
to time.  Malaysia may have been her domicile
of origin (Australian certainly
wasn't) and there is some indication in the evidence that she told her Brisbane
solicitors that she
would go back to Malaysia one day.  In appropriate
circumstances such a statement may bring about the situation where the domicile
of origin applies;  see <b>Chen Chow v Chen Chow </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1911/83.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1911] NSWStRp 83</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281911%29%2011%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1911) 11 SR (NSW) 529.</a>  I
note in passing that in the document recording resealing by the Singapore
court, it is recorded that that court was satisfied
that the testatrix was
domiciled in Malaysia.  It may be (I have not checked on this) that that was a
prerequisite to jurisdiction
to reseal.
<P>

58   	Section 32C of the Wills <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Act
1898</a> provides as follows:
<P>

"A will shall be treated as properly executed if its execution conformed to the
internal law in force;  (a)  in the territory in
which it was executed ...".
<P>

59   	The question that arises is whether in the circumstances
where the High Court of Malaysia has granted probate of a will which
was
executed in Malaysia it is open to anybody to question the formal validity of
the will in NSW.
<P>

60   	I would note that 50 years ago when Malaysia was part of
the British Empire, s 107 of the Wills <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Act 1898</a>
would have permitted the Malaysian grant merely to have been resealed.  The
court would have a discretion as to whether or not it
would order a reseal, but
generally speaking, this would occur;  see <b>Will of Lambe </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%202%20NSWLR%20273" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] 2 NSWLR
273.</a>  Outside Her Majesty's Dominions, production of the foreign probate seems
only to be sufficient proof of death and probably nothing
further;  see <b>Re
Spenceley </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1892%5d%20P%20255" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1892] P 255.</a>
<P>

61   	Section 32C is part of the amendments introduced into NSW
law following the Hague Convention of 1960 on the conflict of laws
relating to
the form of testamentary dispositions.  Section 32C provides that formal
validity by the law of the territory in which
it was executed is an alternative
to formal validity in the territory where the testatrix at the time of her
death habitually resided.
 The question is whether it is sufficient merely to
show that probate has been granted in Malaysia where the will was executed and
this precludes all other questions of formal validity.
<P>

62   	Section 32C only goes to formal validity.  The question is
whether matters of knowledge and approval are matters of formal
validity.  Mr
Harris submits that reference to section 32C cannot assist as the real question
here is essential validity not formal
validity. Although it was I myself who
raised this question, on reflection, Mr Harris' submission must be correct.
<P>

63   	Sykes and Pryles <b>Australian Private International Law
</b>3rd ed (LBC, Sydney, 1991) p 754, opine that questions of essential
validity, that is, the validity of the act of will-making other
than in its
formal aspects including mistake, duress, non est factum, are not covered by s
32C but are determinable by the law of
the last domicile of the deceased.
<P>

64   	As I do not know the testatrix's domicile, this causes a
problem.  However, I can approach the problem by assuming either
 (a)  that the
testatrix was domiciled in Malaysia at the relevant time;  or (b) that she was
domiciled in NSW.  If (a) is the case,
then the court of Malaysia has already
pronounced by its grant of common form probate that it is satisfied inter alia
as to essential
validity.  This would then need to be applied to movables in
NSW.  If (b) is the situation, then what was decided by the grant in
common
form in Malaysia and by the reseal in Singapore is of no value at all.
<P>

65   	This gives rise to the possibility that the 1989 will, the
subject of probate in Malaysia, would deal inter alia with immovables
in
Malaysia as well as movables in Australia and the 1980 will would govern the
fate of immovables and movables in Australia.  This
may lead to a large number
of complications because the NSW executors who hold share certificates for
Australian shares would probably,
if the testatrix died domiciled in Malaysia,
hold those shares on trust for the Malaysian executors who would then
administer the
estate under the 1989 will.
<P>

66   	Mr Blackburn-Hart said that the solution may very well be
that, if the plaintiff loses this case, the defendant would move
in Malaysia to
revoke the common form grant of the 1989 will in view of the findings in this
case.  I accept that that may, in a
practical way, solve the problem.
<P>

67   	Thus a consideration of these conflict of law questions
does not avoid the necessity of giving a decision on the evidence
in this case
as to whether, according to NSW law, the testatrix knew and approved of the
contents of the will.  The fact that probate
was granted in Malaysia of this
will in common form is not a matter which is a "quick fix" of the problem I
have.
<P>

68   	Returning then to the principal problem in this case, I
need to observe that even if there are some unusual factors about
the will, the
presumption of due execution may still apply though with less force:  <b>Re
Lucas </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1966/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] VicRp 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%20VR%20267" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] VR 267</a>, 270;  <b>Re Young </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%20NZLR%20454" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] NZLR 454</a>, 458 and <b>Re
Unsworth </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%208%20SASR%20312" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) 8 SASR 312</a>, 319.
<P>

69   	Thus, the matter is not merely one of choosing between the
proposition that everything is free of suspicion (in which case
the application
can simply be disposed of by applying the presumption of due execution) or the
proposition that this is a suspicious
case  where the court will look closely
at all of the material and insist that the propounder (on whom the burden of
proof rests)
establish the case strictly.
<P>

70   	For the reasons I have set out, even though there are some
odd features about the execution of the will, I still apply the
presumption of
due execution though with less force.
<P>

71   	In making my assessment of the evidence, I take into
account that the will was prepared by a disinterested person, by a lawyer,
it
was witnessed by a second lawyer, that each of those lawyers was skilled in the
preparation of wills and knew of the proper practice
for their execution.  I
also take into account that although they have no memory of the execution, the
probabilities on the evidence
are that the lawyers did their job properly.
<P>

72   	On the other side of the equation, I also bear in mind
that the testatrix was illiterate and the attestation clause does not
say that
the will was read over to her.  This fact, of itself, in view of Mrs Petrus'
evidence of her normal practice, does not cause
me undue worry.  The fact is,
however, reinforced by the problem that at least two of the charities who were
to be the residuary
beneficiaries have been described in inexact terms and a
mistake was made as to the Brisbane property.   Such errors can be explained
on
hypotheses other than that the will was not read over to the testatrix as
claimed by Mrs Petrus.
<P>

73   	I can see no reason why Mrs Petrus would not adopt the
firm's usual practice of reading the will to the testator especially
as she was
introduced to the testatrix by a senior partner and would probably have
considered her to be a special client.
<P>

74   	I consider that it is more likely than not that Dato Khoo
may have imperfectly conveyed to Mrs Petrus the contents of the
will and that
the latter may have read the will in such a way that Mrs Rintoul did not pick
up the major mistake in the document.
 The testatrix may also have thought that
the oddities in the description of the charities were merely matters of legal
phraseology.

<P>

75   	Although my mind has wavered  several times, I consider
that the presumption of due execution, the fact that the will was
made
professionally and that it was thereafter retained by the testatrix as a
special document outweigh other considerations and
that I should grant probate
of the 1989 will.
<P>

76   	Accordingly, I revoke the Common Form Grant of the 1980
will and order the grant Exhibit DX10 to be impounded.  I order that
the
plaintiff be granted administration cta of the 1989 will.  I refer the matter
to the Registrar to complete the grant.
<P>

77   	As the problems that have brought about this application
are really caused by the testatrix in appending her signature to
the 1989 will,
I order that the costs of both parties are to be paid out of the estate on the
indemnity basis.
<P>

78   	The exhibits other than the Common Form Probate and the
Malaysian Probate of the 1989 will may be returned:  there must be
liberty to
apply.
