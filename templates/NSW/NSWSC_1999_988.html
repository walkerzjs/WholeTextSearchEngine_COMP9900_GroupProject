<center><b>REGINA v. SUNG EUN PARK</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>(On application to discharge the jury - see p.608 of
transcript)</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  Application has been made to discharge the jury now
on the basis that the trial has been irretrievably damaged
by the fractured
process to date.  
<P>

2  	This application commenced prior to today and has proceeded
before me today, particularly in the context of the Crown attempting
to provide
some material, whether sufficient or not one is unable to say, concerning the
witness whose arrival from Korea is shortly
expected. 
<P>

3  	The trial has been grossly fractured to date.  Mr. Temby, QC. has
pointed out of the 15 sitting days that could have been available,
seven and a
half have occupied the attention of the jury more or less.  
<P>

4  	However, my observation of the jury does not indicate to me that
the effect upon them has in fact been such as to divert them
from their ability
to appreciate, as well as it might have been appreciated, the material and the
circumstantial evidence in the
case in the way in which that evidence has been
tendered.  
<P>

5  	The interruptions have been most unfortunate.  Those
interruptions, as I have observed previously, have, in the main, been related
to the difficulties created by the late calling of the witness from Korea.  
<P>

6  	In the material now made available to me, there appears an
indemnity in respect of offences and offences associated with the
death of the
victims involved in the present charges.  There also appears correspondence and
undertakings in respect of mutual assistance
agreements between Australia and
South Korea.  It seems highly likely that that material is an inadequate
provision of the material
that might be necessary for the defence to be able
properly to cross-examine the witness on her understanding of the position in
which she is placed.
<P>

7  	Further, I note that statutory immunities are referred to in that
material as well.  These matters bode ill for avoiding further
disruption.  For
the moment I need say no more about that, except that it is contended by Mr.
Temby, on behalf of the accused, that
the process so far has so fractured the
trial that a discharge is now required.  
<P>

8  	Whatever may have been the history of the fractured process, in
my view no discharge is presently warranted.  
<P>

9  	It may or may not be, however, that that which occurs for the
future in the context of that history may merit a discharge. 
In particular I
have regard to what I said in the judgment I delivered on the application
concerning the increasing frailty of the
trial.
<P>

10  	Notwithstanding that the trial has, thanks to a listing
misunderstanding, been adjourned until Tuesday, it does not seem to
me that the
jury is any the worse off now than I expected it would be then.  It may,
however, be worse off in the future, in which
case the consequence, should the
application be renewed, Mr. Temby, having reserved the opportunity, as it were,
to make a further
application, would not necessarily be the same.  
<P>

11  	I appreciate also that those individuals charged with the
prosecution of the matter before me are doing what they can.  That
is not the
point, however.  Mr. Temby, indeed, expressly has accepted that the individuals
are doing what they can.  
<P>

12  	The issue is whether the trial fairness is or will be so
affected and the defence inappropriately handicapped.   The issue
is one that
will, of course, be examined in the light of the principles in <b>Regina v.
Glennon</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20179%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 179 CLR 1</a> that to a certain extent all parties may have to
accept some degree of handicap and nonetheless a trial will be fair.  But the
importance
of this witness and the importance of maintaining the trial are
matters which at present do not mind me to grant the application.
<P>
