<P>

<b>Reasons for judgment</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, Zivadin Stevanovic, is a most unfortunate man.  He
was injured in three unrelated accidents between
1985 and 1989.  He has
commenced proceedings for damages in relation to each of them and the three
cases have been heard together.
 Liability is admitted in all of them. The only
matters I must determine are the measure of his damages and the extent of the
responsibility
of each of the three defendants for them.
<P>

	<b>Background</b>
<P>

2	The plaintiff was born in Yugoslavia on 2 November 1947.  In the early 1960's
he trained as a carpenter and joiner and, apart
from one and a half years
engaged in national service in the Yugoslav army, he worked at that trade until
1970.  In June of that
year, at the age of 22, he migrated to Australia.
<P>

3	Over the next fifteen years he had a variety of jobs in various parts of
Australia, mostly in his chosen trade and most of them
for periods only of
months.  On three occasions during that period he travelled to Yugoslavia to
visit his family and on another
occasion he holidayed briefly in the United
States.  On one of the visits to Yugoslavia he ended up staying three and a
half years
because he formed a relationship with a lady. However, that
relationship did not endure and he returned to Australia alone. 
<P>

4	In January 1983 he commenced a relationship with Ms Milena Bucalina.  That
relationship is still on foot, although it is part
of the plaintiff's case that
it has been adversely affected by his injuries. 
<P>

5	In March 1985 he began work as a carpenter with a firm known as `Mick's
Formwork', the proprietors of which were Milan Stjelja
and three others, the
defendants in the first action.  Prior to the accident which gave rise to that
action he had enjoyed good health.
<P>

	<b>First Accident (Stevanovic v Stjelja &amp; Ors: 16978/85)</b>
<P>

6	On 24 July 1985, as an employee of Mick's Formwork, the plaintiff was engaged
in stripping some plywood formwork from concrete
steps in the cellar of the RSL
club in George Street, Sydney.  To gain access to the top of the formwork he
climbed an aluminium
ladder.  In the course of his knocking some of the
formwork down, the bottom of the ladder slipped and he fell to the floor in a
sitting position.  He landed on his buttocks and his right hand and felt
"strong pain" in his lower back, right hand and right leg.

<P>

7	On the day of the accident the plaintiff saw Dr Graeme MacDougall, a general
practitioner, who noted tenderness and marked muscle
spasm in the lumbar area.
He prescribed medication and arranged for massage treatment. Upon review on 9
August 1985 he found that
the plaintiff had not improved, and arranged for him
to see an orthopaedic specialist, Dr David Sonnabend. 
<P>

8	On 29 August 1985 the plaintiff consulted Dr Mark Marinkovich, a general
practitioner who spoke his native tongue, and he remained
under his care for
some years thereafter.  To Dr Marinkovich he complained of low back pain,
radiating to his buttocks and sometimes
to the thoracic spine and neck,
together with pain in his right wrist and both knees.  He said that he could
not stand, walk or sit
for long periods and that various bodily movements were
restricted. 
<P>

9	Before he saw Dr Sonnabend the plaintiff was involved in the second
accident.
<P>

	<b>Second Accident (Stevanovic v New South Wales Ministerial Insurance
Corporation: 12456/95)</b>
<P>

10	In the early evening of 9 September 1985 the plaintiff was driving in the
Cabramatta area, proceeding slowly while looking for
a parking spot, when his
vehicle was struck from behind by another vehicle.  He described the impact as
"enormous", and said that
he felt pain in his lower back, his neck, his left
knee and both wrists.
<P>

11	Shortly after the accident the plaintiff saw Dr MacDougall and Dr Sonnabend,
and in December 1985 he again consulted Dr Marinkovich,
who referred him to Dr
John Bannister, orthopaedic surgeon.  It is significant that to none of these
doctors did he complain of back
pain as a result of the second accident.
However, he did complain of the other injuries, together with headaches, and it
is clear
that he suffered a significant whiplash type injury.  All doctors
noted a limited range of movement in his neck and shoulders, and
Dr Bannister
reported that x-rays disclosed degenerative changes in the cervical spine.  
<P>

12	In February 1986 the plaintiff came under the care of Dr Robert Smith, an
orthopaedic surgeon specialising in lower back pain,
upon referral by Dr
Marinkovich.  Dr Smith saw him a number of times between then and July 1989,
when the third accident occurred.
  Over that period he complained of lower
back pain, which was constant and moderate but which became worse, sometimes
severe, after
activity.  He complained also of pain and numbness in his legs
and significant restriction of movement.  A Fentanyl assessment in
December
1986 confirmed that there was an organic basis for these complaints, as did an
MRI in January 1987.  Again, the history
given by the plaintiff to Dr Smith
appears to have attributed his back condition entirely to the first accident,
and the doctor gave
evidence that this was consistent with his clinical
observations.
<P>

13	Dr Smith used various forms of treatment, to no avail.  In October 1986 the
plaintiff was admitted to hospital for three weeks
of traction.  In May 1987 he
was again admitted to hospital for a discogram and Discase injection.
<P>

14	In a report to Dr Marinkovich of January 1987, Dr Smith observed that the
plaintiff was "really making no progress..."  In a
medico-legal report of that
same month, Dr Marinkovich himself wrote:
<P>

	Despite long and intensive treatment, the patient's condition has not improved
at all, as a matter of fact it has worsened to some
extent.  During the course
of his treatment, the patient developed anxiety and depression some time in
August 1986.  He was therefore
prescribed with tranquillisers and
anti-depressants which gave good results.
<P>

15	In 1992 Dr Smith reported that the Discase injection was "not associated
with any lasting improvement".  He added that the situation
"remained unchanged
through '88 and '89".  Back classes, also, brought about no improvement.  
<P>

16	Treatment of the plaintiff's neck was maintained by Dr Bannister.  In
September 1987 he had him admitted to hospital for traction
for one week. In a
report of January 1986 to Dr Marinkovich, Dr Bannister concluded that the
plaintiff had "soft tissue injuries
to his neck which will take some time to
settle".  This conveys that, all things being equal, he could expect recovery
from that
condition in time.
<P>

17	This was how things stood at the time of the third accident in July 1989.
<P>

	<b>Third Accident (Stevanovic v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd: 20548/95)</b>
<P>

18	On 19 July 1989 the plaintiff was a passenger in a motor vehicle travelling
in the kerbside lane on Pittwater Road, Warriewood.
 A vehicle travelling in
the opposite direction lost control, crossed several lanes of traffic, and
collided head on with the vehicle
in which the plaintiff was travelling.
<P>

19	The plaintiff said that he felt "enormous pain" in his neck.  He also felt
pain in his left knee, which struck the dashboard,
and in his hands, apparently
because he seized what is colloquially known as a "holy mackerel" handle on the
dashboard immediately
before the impact.
<P>

20	Again, the plaintiff's evidence was that his back pain increased after this
accident, but this also is not borne out by the contemporaneous
medical
material.  It seems that he made no such complaint at Mona Vale hospital, where
he was taken on the day of the accident.
 He later saw Dr William Koch at
Frenchs Forest, but his own evidence was that he told that doctor only about
his neck and his left
knee.  He again saw Dr Marinkovich but made no complaint
about his back.  Nor did he in a motor accident personal injury claim form,
which was completed towards the end of 1989. 
<P>

21	There is no doubt, however, that this accident exacerbated the plaintiff's
neck condition.  In October 1989, he underwent upper
body thermography, which
suggested to Dr Bannister "a reasonable prognosis".  Nevertheless, the doctor
considered that he had "a
poor prognosis for early recovery", although he
expected further improvement "in the long term".  When he reviewed the
plaintiff
in January 1992, Dr Bannister reported that he "has severe symptoms
in his neck which will be slow to resolve".  In September 1992
the plaintiff
consulted another general practitioner, Dr Joseph Nicholas, who reported that
his neck symptoms might have resolved
over five to seven years after the second
accident but that the third accident would "add to this".
<P>

22	The plaintiff's back problems continued unabated.  In February 1991 Dr Smith
performed a spinal fusion, a procedure which he
had recommended earlier but
which the plaintiff had been reluctant to undergo.  He was in hospital for
three weeks and, upon his
discharge, suffered considerable pain and needed
crutches for about three months.  In July 1991 Dr Smith reported that his pain
was
improving and he was walking without support.  However, in a report of
September 1991, the doctor recorded that his walking had improved
but that he
was experiencing more pain than he had been before the operation.  He observed
that his lumbar movements were "moderately
limited with spasm but no skew".  He
added, "I am at a loss to know where to go from here..."  
<P>

	<b>Continuing Disabilities</b>
<P>

23	The plaintiff's evidence was that he continued to experience lower back
pain, radiating primarily to his right leg, with resultant
restriction of
movement.  For some time he had been exercising by swimming, but could only
manage about one lap.  However, he could
obtain some relief, albeit not
lasting, from a hot water spa at Lightning Ridge.  He first visited the spa in
1992, staying for five
weeks on that occasion, and he returned there once in
each of the following three years.  Unfortunately, he could not afford to
continue
these trips.
<P>

24	He said that the condition of his neck remained unchanged, with pain
radiating up the sides of his neck and into his shoulders
and right arm.  He
was still suffering associated headaches, although they were not constant but
would "come and go". 
<P>

25	The plaintiff's evidence is borne out by the medical reports.  In a report
of August 1996, Dr Marinkovich said of him, "Over
the last 8 years his
symptomatology and clinical picture remained more or less unchanged with
noticeable deterioration of his back
condition."  He observed that depression
was secondary to his injuries generally, and added that the advance of
"osteospondylitic
changes, speeded up by mechanical derangements" arising from
the accidents, could be faster than had been anticipated.  Dr Nicholas,
in a
report of August 1994, considered him prone "to more rapid degenerative
spondylitic changes in his lumbar and cervical spine".

<P>

26	In 1996 the plaintiff came under the care of Dr Grahame Mahoney, orthopaedic
specialist, who reviewed his condition generally.
 In a report of August 1997,
he wrote: 
<P>

	Mr Stevanovic complains of persisting symptoms referrable to cervical strain
in association with degenerate changes with nerve
root irritation affecting the
upper limbs, the headaches of which he complains being referred from the
neck....
<P>

	He has also developed symptoms referrable to a low lumbar disc lesion with
nerve root irritation affecting the lower limbs ...
<P>

	It is reasonable that he does have persisting symptoms and it is unlikely that
his present symptoms will improve to any great extent.
 
<P>

27	In oral evidence, Dr Mahoney expressed no surprise that the spinal fusion
had not improved the plaintiff's condition.  He said
that he did not favour the
procedure which, in his experience, had a very low success rate. 
<P>

28	Effectively, the plaintiff has not worked at all since the first accident. I
shall turn to the question of his employment capacity
in a moment. His evidence
of the effect of the accidents upon his lifestyle in other respects is much as
one would expect. He said
that he tried to keep himself busy during the day by
repairing items of furniture but for the most part he read or watched TV. He
was sometimes bored and generally unhappy.  His relationship with Ms Bucalina,
which had been good, deteriorated to a point which
he described as a
"disaster".  In 1986 they separated for some years, although there were periods
of reconciliation. One of those
periods led to the birth of their son in May
1987. Eventually, they resumed co-habitation and were together at the time of
the hearing.
 However, the relationship was not as it had been before the first
accident.
<P>

	<b>Non Economic Loss</b>
<P>

29	Counsel for the defendants in all three actions tendered their own medical
reports, some of which expressed the opinion that
the extent and significance
of the plaintiff's injuries were less than he would have me believe.  However,
in final addresses counsel
for the defendants placed very little reliance upon
these reports.  I found the plaintiff to be a frank witness, whose testimony
of
his suffering over the years was not exaggerated.  I do not understand counsel
for the defendants to have submitted to the contrary.
 Subject to one matter,
to which I shall refer, I also believe that he gave an accurate account of the
symptoms he experienced after
each of the three accidents.
<P>

30	It is clear, then, that the plaintiff has suffered injuries which have
caused him serious and enduring pain and disability. 
They have had, and will
continue to have, a grave effect upon his life, physically and emotionally.  He
was thirty-seven years old
at the time of the first accident and was fifty at
the time of the hearing. Accordingly, his injuries have bedevilled his mature
years and will deprive him of much of the enjoyment of later life. 
<P>

31	The real area of dispute is the extent to which the defendants in the three
actions are answerable for his condition.  It is
convenient to refer to the
defendants in the first action, the proprietors of Mick's Formwork, as the
first defendants; the defendant
in the second action, NSW Insurance Ministerial
Corporation, as the second defendant; and the defendant in the third action,
FAI
General Insurance, as the third defendant.  It was suggested from the bar
table that I should assess the award for non-economic loss
globally, and then
apportion it between the various defendants so as to recognise the extent of
their responsibility for it. There
is some merit in this approach, but it is
complicated by the fact that damages for the first and second accidents (in
1985) must
be assessed in accordance with common law principles, whereas
damages in respect of the third accident (in 1989) are governed by
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor
Accidents Act</i> 1988</a>.
<P>

32	I have referred earlier to the plaintiff's evidence to the effect that each
of the second and third accidents aggravated his
back condition.  Later medical
reports expressed that view, based upon the same history provided by the
plaintiff in recent years.
 No doubt, his evidence about this is honest but I
am satisfied that it is mistaken.  It is not surprising that, many years after
these events, his recollection of the symptoms attributable to each accident
might be faulty.  As I have said, there was no complaint
of increased back pain
in the history he provided to various doctors near to the time of each of those
two accidents.  In the light
of the whole of the evidence, my conclusion is
that his back condition is referable entirely to the first accident.
<P>

33	This is not to deny the significance of the two later accidents.  As counsel
for the plaintiff put it in address, "... the subsequent
events added
disabilities to an already disabled man."  The major effect of the second
accident was a serious neck condition which,
left undisturbed, would have taken
some years to resolve.  There are x-ray reports in evidence which suggest
degenerative changes
in the cervical spine prior to the third accident.
Nevertheless, on the evidence as a whole, I conclude that the result of that
accident
was to render his neck condition permanent. 
<P>

34	As observed, the assessment of damages for the third accident is governed by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s79</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Accidents Act</a></i>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 79(1)</a>, as it stood in 1989,
permits an award of damages for non-economic loss only if I am satisfied that
that accident significantly impaired
the plaintiff's ability to lead a normal
life.  This must be determined in the light of his condition at the time of the
hearing:
<i>Matthews v  Dean</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2011%20MVR%20455" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 11 MVR 455</a>,  <i>England v Van Donk</i>
(Court of Appeal, unreported, 5 December 1997).  I am so satisfied.
<P>

35	In arriving at my assessment I have had regard to the plaintiff's present
condition, whilst bearing in mind that I must determine
the extent of the
various defendants' responsibility for it and that the amount to be awarded
against the third defendant is governed
by the Act.  Undoubtedly, the
plaintiff's back problem is the most serious aspect of his condition and the
first defendants face
a considerably higher assessment than the others.
Against them I would award $100,000.  Against the second defendant I would
award
$40,000.  As to the third defendant, I consider that the plaintiff is
entitled to 16% of the maximum amount under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s79(3)</a> of the Act.  For present
purposes, that maximum is $250,000, 16% of which is $40,000.  After a deduction
of $20,500 in accordance
with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/s79.html" class="autolink_findacts">s79(5)</a>, the resultant figure is $19,500.
<P>

36	I consider that half the amount awarded against the first defendants is
referable to the past and should attract interest at
the usual rate of 2%.  The
awards against the second and third defendants do not attract interest: as to
the second defendant, by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/mvpia1942396/s35d.html" class="autolink_findacts">s35D(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/mvpia1942396/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Vehicles (Third Party
Insurance) Act</i> 1942</a>; and as against the third defendant, by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/s73.html" class="autolink_findacts">s73(3)</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Accidents Act</a></i>.
<P>

	<b>Loss of Earnings</b>
<P>

37	Early in these reasons I sketched the plaintiff's work history.  Counsel for
the first defendants described it as "peripatetic",
but I do not consider that
to be a fair assessment of it.  As his own counsel observed, for most of that
time he was living a bachelor's
life, free to leave a job and travel if he
wished to do so.  What is clear is that he never had any difficulty obtaining
work.  More
importantly, in 1983 he came under the maturing influence of his
relationship with Ms Bucalina.  I accept his evidence that, by 1985,
he had
aspirations to start his own business and no intention of retiring early.  I
consider that, but for his injuries, he would
have remained in constant
employment as a carpenter throughout a normal working life.  Accordingly, I do
not propose to discount
his award for past loss of wages for vicissitudes and
the award for future wage loss should be discounted on that basis by the usual
15%.
<P>

38	I referred earlier to the plaintiff's evidence that he was able to do some
household work involving his carpentry skills, such
as the repair of items of
furniture.  Of course, carpentry involves bending, lifting and prolonged
standing and it is clear that
his back condition precluded these activities,
and continues to do so.  In addition, his neck condition has made it difficult
for
him to look up or turn around.  He explained in evidence that his trade
sometimes requires movements of that kind, for example, when
driving nails into
a ceiling.
<P>

39	In 1986 he tried to resume work with Mick's Formwork and applied for jobs
with two other carpenters but, because of his condition,
he was unsuccessful.
Later in that year he undertook some work for Mr Yugoslav Djukanovic, fixing
skirting boards and architraves
and hanging doors.  Not surprisingly, he could
not manage these tasks because of his disabilities and he was unable to
continue.
 Carpentry is the only trade for which he is qualified.  The question
of his teaching that trade was raised, but I accept his evidence
(and that of
Mr Djukanovic) that teaching necessarily involves practical demonstration of
skills, which would be hampered by his
physical limitations.
<P>

40	I am satisfied that the plaintiff's injuries prevented him from re-entering
the workforce and that, given his age and continuing
disabilities, there is no
prospect of his doing so in the future.  A number of the defendants' medical
reports expressed the view
that he is capable of work involving light duties,
but there is simply no evidence of employment of that kind which might be
available
to him.  I find the views of doctors whose reports were tendered in
his case to be more realistic.  Dr Nicholas in a report of August
1994 said of
him, "In terms of prognosis, this man is permanently unfit to work as a
carpenter and would not be able to cope with
most occupations."  In a report of
August 1996, Dr Marinkovich declared him "permanently unfit for work."  In
August 1997 Dr Mahoney
said of the plaintiff, "I would consider him unfit for
work and would not suggest he resume the workforce."  He was also seen for
medico-legal purposes by Dr John Roarty, orthopaedic surgeon, who reported in
July 1996:
<P>

	...he would be unfit to do his previous work as a carpenter or unfit to do any
work requiring any heavy labour, particularly bending
and lifting, or any
agility on his cervical and lumbar spines or work requiring rotational strains.
He is therefore very restricted
in the labour market and would have great
difficulty in finding any other alternative work.
<P>

41	The question which must then be determined is which of the defendants must
bear responsibility for the plaintiff's inability
to work, past and future.  I
am satisfied that it is the first defendants.  It is true that his neck
condition creates added difficulties
in carrying out his accustomed tasks.
Nevertheless, in the light of the plaintiff's evidence and the medical
material, it is clear
that his back condition put paid to any prospect of
re-employment.  I have held that the first defendants are solely responsible
for that condition. I accept the submission of counsel for the second defendant
that, at the time of the second accident, the plaintiff
had no income earning
capacity: cf <i>Jobling v Associated Dairies Limited</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] UKHL 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20AC%20794" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] AC 794</a> per Lord
Keith of Kinkel at 815-6; <i>Wynn v NSW Insurance Ministerial Corporation</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/53.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 53</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2070%20ALJR%20147" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 70 ALJR 147</a> in the joint judgment at 154.  Obviously, the same is true
at the time of the third accident.
<P>

42	As to past loss of earnings, counsel for the plaintiff and for the first
defendants both provided schedules.  The first defendants'
schedule is based on
award rates.  The plaintiff's amended schedule, part of exhibit C, is based
upon the plaintiff's actual earnings
between May and July 1995, increased
proportionately to increases in the National Building and Trades Construction
Award and the
Building Tradesmen (State) Construction Award.  In my view, the
plaintiff's schedule more fairly represents his actual loss and it
is that
approach which should be adopted. 
<P>

43	The plaintiff is entitled to interest on the amount assessed for past loss
of earnings, after deducting Workers' Compensation
and Department of Social
Security payments he has received.  His counsel also provided a schedule of
interest rates, derived from
Schedule J to the <i>Supreme Court Rules</i>, over
the relevant period.  From that schedule it is accepted that the appropriate
rate is 7.3%.  There is a <i>Fox v Wood </i>claim upon which I was not
addressed, and which I assume not to be in dispute.
<P>

44	Future loss of earnings should also be assessed on the basis of the
plaintiff's schedule.  The amount should be discounted by
the usual 3% and by a
further 15% for vicissitudes.  On economic loss generally, the parties may wish
to bring the figures up to
date as some months have passed since the
hearing.
<P>

	<b>Gratuitous Services</b>
<P>

45	Against the first defendants only, the plaintiff claims for gratuitous
services rendered to him by Ms Bucalina and her mother
for six months after his
discharge from hospital following his spinal fusion.  The claim is for forty
hours per week at the rate
of average weekly earnings of $500.  Counsel for the
first defendants did not dispute the weekly rate of $500.  He acknowledged that
some services had been rendered in the first three months, although he queried
the extent of them.  He submitted that the evidence
did not establish any such
services after that period. 
<P>

46	On this matter the plaintiff gave some brief evidence, which was not tested
in cross-examination.  Neither Ms Bucalina nor her
mother was called.  That
evidence establishes that he was afforded a good deal of care during the first
three months, and I consider
the estimate of forty hours per week as
reasonable.  However, it is very imprecise about the level of care thereafter
and provides
no adequate basis upon which it could be assessed.  I would allow
an award for gratuitous services for three months at the rate of
$500 per week.
That award also should attract interest at 7.3%. 
<P>

	<b>Out of Pocket Expenses</b>
<P>

47	Accepting that the plaintiff's back condition is wholly the responsibility
of the defendants, the agreed figure for out of pocket
expenses in their case
is $23,568.  For the second defendant, the agreed figure is $3,951.  As to the
third defendant, I find that
the expenditure set out in a hand-written schedule
was justified.  On that basis, the agreed figure is $4,452.  Whether the third
defendant seeks any contribution from the second defendant in respect of that
amount is not a matter upon which their counsel addressed
me, but I will hear
submissions about it if need be.
<P>

	<b>Short Minutes</b>
<P>

48	I request the parties to bring in short minutes to give effect to my reasons
and, if necessary, I shall hear argument on costs.
 Counsel should not hesitate
to inform me if I have made any technical or procedural error or have failed to
deal with any matter
in dispute.
<P>
