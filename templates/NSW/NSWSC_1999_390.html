<b>ALLEN &amp; UNWIN PTY LIMITED</b>

<P>

<b>JUDGMENT  (Application for interlocutory injunction)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiff Paula Yates (who now in apparent compliance with
the Rules of Court in her Amended Statement of Claim,
filed in court today,
discloses her address to be out of the jurisdiction, namely in London), seeks
to restrain the defendant, Allen
&amp; Unwin Pty Limited, from publishing,
distributing or causing to be sold, or offering for sale, material said to
convey the three
imputations in the amended statement of claim.
<P>

2	Exhibit A on the plaintiff's application is a paperback book entitled
"<i>Michael Hutchence</i>" with a subtitle or blurb: "<i>A Tragic Rock</i>
<i>and Roll Story:  A Definitive Biography</i>".  Exhibit A bears upon its rear
cover what can be described as an Angus &amp; Robertson bar code sales sticker.
Exhibit 1 is an
identical physical object to Exhibit A together with a review
copy slip which on its face indicates publication to be on 16 April
1999.  It
is this book that is said to give rise to the defamatory imputations, reliance
being placed on part only of the second
paragraph of page 186 and part only of
the last paragraph commencing on page 197 and appearing at page 198.  Those
imputations are:
<P>

	<i>"5(a)	Contrary to the wishes of her lover Michael Hutchence, the plaintiff
had unbeknown to him deliberately sought to become pregnant
to him and thereby
trap him into a permanent relationship.</i>
<P>

	<i>(b)	Contrary to the wishes of her lover Michael Hutchence, the plaintiff
had intentionally become pregnant to him and thereby trapped
him into a
permanent relationship.</i>
<P>

	<i>(c)	The plaintiff had lied, in claiming after the death of Michael
Hutchence to have had fertility treatment, in order to cover up
her own
deceitfulness in having trapped him into a permanent relationship by
intentionally becoming pregnant to him contrary to his
wishes".</i>
<P>

3	I propose to decline the relief sought.
<P>

4	It is impossible presently to give full and detailed reasons, but essentially
applications for injunctive relief in respect of
a publication which is
asserted to carry defamatory imputations must, but rarely do, expose the
clearest of entitlement to that relief.
 In my opinion this is not one of those
cases that clearly does.  Nor is it one, when I consider all of the material,
and there is
a lot of it, which has been placed before me, which would bring
about the exercise of my discretion in the light of that material
and would
warrant the restraint imposed upon the defendant constituted by the orders
sought.
<P>

5	I will say at this stage that I am particularly impressed by the following
propositions.  This is not a case where, if the jury
finds the publications not
to carry the imputations, it would be an unreasonable finding.
<P>

6	It is a case where the defendant, in commercial circumstances, - the details
of which are not known to the plaintiff or indeed
to the court - I am
satisfied, has embarked upon distribution of the book outside of New South
Wales and in New Zealand on the evidence,
to an extent where in relation to
that publication or that distribution and any consequent sale the plaintiff's
remedy would lie
only in damages.
<P>

7	In any event, nothing in the material permits me to draw any inference
adverse to the defendant on the chronology of events, as
I understand it, to
the effect that it embarked upon the distribution of the book for retail sale
in New South Wales and elsewhere
in the knowledge of the plaintiff's complaint
in the United Kingdom or otherwise in haste to the extent, if at all, that it
could
lead to a finding disentitling the defendant, even on an application of
this kind, to consideration in the exercise of discretion
and the weighing of
the balance of convenience.
<P>

8	Another factor that does impress me (and I can do more at this stage of the
day than tabulate the factors):  whilst arguably there
is consistency between
the matter complained of here, and the case in the High Court in England, those
proceedings were starkly different
to the present.  The now exposed terms of
the resolution of that litigation (including the plaintiff paying the
defendant's costs)
cannot be relied upon in any way for the present purposes as
being material available to put the defendant on notice.  The resolution
referred to is available to raise serious questions as to the utility or
illusory nature of any undertaking that the plaintiff would
otherwise have to
give both as to damages or by way of security for costs in the event of there
being an application therefor.  In
this respect, I must remark, it comes as a
surprise that there was no suggestion that any such offer would be forthcoming
from the
plaintiff, resident in London, in urgently seeking to restrain
publication here.
<P>

9	Next, of course on an application of this kind one cannot embark upon a
detailed examination of the defences apparently available
or which might become
available to the defendant.  Equally one cannot merely dismiss any reference to
the publisher's stated intention
to defend, the more so when the publication
complained of is a book. Some parts of the text of the book, other than those
relied
upon by the plaintiff, may well point to available contextual
imputations as here suggested.  The defendant fairly cannot be expected,
in my
view, to state now what its position is or might well be in this regard.
<P>

10	Next in the tabulation of matters leading to the conclusion adverse to the
plaintiff, is the submission that the imputations
relied upon by the plaintiff
could not, as a matter of law, be found to relate to a matter of public
interest.  Judicial officers
are not quarantined from gaining some general
knowledge about a lot of areas of life, not least of which is the pop music
industry
and its participants and the high profile they can develop and enjoy.
Even leaving that to one side, the <i>New Idea</i> article, being part of
Exhibit 2, is sufficient to indicate to me that the plaintiff has not been shy
about exposing publicly matters
in relation to her sexual conduct, to put it
very succinctly.  The argument that any pleaded imputation could not relate to
a matter
of public interest, in my view, is unavailable.
<P>

11	Finally, in the enumeration of the matters, I am not persuaded that the
plaintiff's remedy, otherwise available, namely damages,
can be said to be a
non-available remedy in this situation.  Section 46A of the <i>Defamation
Act</i> certainly makes legislative changes that can effect the quantification
of damages.  This is still an area to be fully explored as
to its significance.
But I consider it fair to say that the mere enactment of that amending
legislation cannot have the effect (1)
of the extreme nature advanced by Mr
Wheelhouse that defamation damages are going to be so low, that they can never
provide an adequate
remedy, or, (2) so circumscribe the approach of the trial
judge as to link inexorably the computation of damages with awards for
non-economic loss in personal injury litigation.
<P>

12	I will only remark in relation to the first aspect that, if it be right,
that the plaintiff can now say by reason of s 46A: 
"<i>I will never get
enough, so give me an injunction"</i>, the ramifications for free speech would
be quite concerning.
<P>

13	The application is dismissed.  I will stand the Amended Statement of Claim
over to the Defamation List on 30 April.
<P>

14	The plaintiff is to pay the defendant's costs.
