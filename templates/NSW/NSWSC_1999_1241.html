COMMON LAW DIVISION

MASTER MALPASS
<P>

THURSDAY 16 DECEMBER 1999
<P>

<u>13047/1998</u>	<u>ALAN HOWARD BAKER &amp; ANOR v JAMES ALOYSIUS
KEARNEY</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The defendant is a barrister.  He provided legal services for the
plaintiffs.  The work was performed in chambers.  A significant
part of it
involved the reviewing of documentation and drafting work (including a draft
Statement of Claim and a draft Reply to a
Request for Further and Better
Particulars).  The work was performed during a period between 15 May 1995 and 8
January 1997.  He
rendered fees in the total sum of $61,510.  He gave them a "a
Memorandum of Fees due to James A Kearney (Bill of Costs)" dated 15
January
1997.
<P>

2  	None of the fees have been paid.  On 17 December 1997, the
defendant applied to this Court for an assessment of costs. The application
was
referred to a costs assessor (Mr Hattersley).  He received submissions from the
parties.  He had the opportunity to inspect documents
in the chambers of the
defendant (five A4 folders).  The assessment appears to have been a protracted
exercise.  A Certificate of
Determination was issued on 13 November 1998.  The
determination allowed the costs in full (in effect, he determined the
application
by confirming the Bill of Costs).
<P>

3  	The Costs Assessor sent the certificate under cover of a letter
of the same date.  It contained inter alia the following:-
<P>

"I have now considered all of the material and evidence put before me by
yourselves and Perkes &amp; Stone solicitors acting for
Mr James Kearney.
<P>

I have determined that the fees charged by Mr James Kearney the subject of this
application are fair and reasonable in all of the
circumstances of the complex
matters he dealt with for the respondents."
<P>

4  	There was a subsequent letter from the Costs Assessor.  It was
dated 27 November 1999.  The court was told that it was a response
to a request
for reasons.  The letter included the following:-
<P>

"In this application for assessment I issued a Certificate of Determination as
to Costs which confirmed the barrister's costs charged
to the respondents - see
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208A(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act 1987</a> as amended.  In these
circumstances I maintain I am under no obligation to provide reasons for making
that determination and I therefore
decline to do so."
<P>

5  	The plaintiffs have filed a Summons For Leave To Appeal.  The
object of the process is to seek leave of the court to appeal
against the
determination pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208M</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</u> 1987</a> (the
Act).  As the application has been brought out of time, the plaintiffs also
need an extension of time to bring the application
for leave.
<P>

6  	The court has a discretionary power to both extend time and to
grant leave.  The power is exercised having regard to the relevant
circumstances of the particular case before the court and so that justice is
best served between the parties.  The party seeking
relief bears the onus of
satisfying the court of entitlement thereto.
<P>

7  	The hearing took place on 8 December 1999.  The evidence was
parsimonious.  Ultimately, none of the plaintiffs' affidavit material
was
received in evidence.  The plaintiffs did tender documentation.  Exhibit A was
the application in the assessment proceedings
(a part of that document was the
defendant's Bill of Costs).  Exhibit B comprised three documents (including the
certificate).  Exhibit
C was the Statement of Claim which had been drafted by
the defendant.  Exhibit D was the draft Reply to a Request for Further and
Better Particulars.  The defendant relied on an affidavit sworn by Mr Moore
(the solicitor for the defendant).
<P>

8  	It is convenient to first look at the merits of the application
for leave.  Clearly, there would be no utility in granting an
extension of time
if the application for leave had no real prospects of success.
<P>

9  	Broadly speaking, the plaintiffs advanced two arguments in
support of the application for leave.  It was said that there had
been a
failure to give reasons.  This was advanced as an error of law.  It was said
that leave should be given because the quantum
of the bill on its face was
staggeringly excessive.  This was advanced as an error of fact.
<P>

10  	The submissions made to the Costs Assessor have not been placed
before the court.  However, the court has been informed that
there was only one
issue agitated in the assessment.  This was a limited issue as to whether or
not the costs charged were excessive.
<P>

11  	For completeness, I should mention that an attempt was made
during the hearing to agitate "the quality of the work" as a ground
for leave.
As it had not been agitated before the Costs Assessor, it seemed to me that in
the circumstances of this case, the plaintiffs
should not now be allowed to
rely on it.
<P>

12  	The Bill of Costs falls into three sections.  There is work that
was performed up to 17 July 1995 and which concluded with
the drafting of a
Statement of Claim.  A charge of $34,458 was made for this work.  There was
work done between 16 August 1995 and
18 December 1995.  During the course of
the performance of this work the draft Reply to Request for Further and Better
Particulars
was prepared.  The balance of the Memorandum of Fees or Bill of
Costs relates to work done between 11 March 1996 and 8 January 1997.
<P>

13  	It appears that the costing was done in accordance with an
hourly rate.  At no stage, has it been said that the hourly rate
was not
reasonable.  The dispute has related only to the number of hours in respect of
which the rate was charged.  It is not in
dispute that the defendant actually
performed work for the hours at which the charge was made.  The limited issue
between the parties
both before the Costs Assessor and this Court was whether
or not the time expended in performance of the work was excessive.
<P>

14  	The court has been told that the work was done in relation to a
commercial matter.  There was inter alia complexity.  There
was considerable
documentation.  There were five folders of documents.  The draft Statement of
Claim alleged many causes of action
and exceeded 50 pages and the draft reply
extended to 43 pages.
<P>

15  	The difficulty for the court is the lack of relevant evidence.
It does not have before it all of the material which would enable
an assessment
of the degree of the complexity and the quantum of the volume of documentation
that had to be handled by the defendant.
 Whilst the Costs Assessor had the
opportunity to inspect certain documentation, the court did not have that
advantage.
<P>

16  	The parties have referred to authorities which deal with the
question of the giving of reasons for a determination by a costs
assessor.  It
has been held that there is an obligation to give reasons.  The approach has
been taken that a failure to sufficiently
disclose the reasoning process may
amount to error of law justifying a disturbing of the determination.
<P>

17  	What needs to be done by a costs assessor, by way of disclosure
of reasoning process, can be expected to vary from case to
case.  There may be
cases in which a formal expression of the reasoning process will be of no
significance.  There will be cases
in which the reasoning process is
sufficiently revealed by documentation in the assessment (including
correspondence and/or the certificate
itself).
<P>

18  	In this case, there was only one issue.  This was identified by
the Costs Assessor in a letter dated 1 April 1998 ("The gravamen
of the
respondents' objections would seem to be their claim that the time spent by the
applicant in performing the tasks set out
in the bill are `excessive' ").
<P>

19  	It may be further added that the Costs Assessor did seek further
assistance from the plaintiffs as to their claim that the
bill was excessive
(see letter dated 1 April 1998).  There is nothing before the court to suggest
that this plea received any positive
response.  It seems that the Costs
Assessor may have been left with an objection which was framed in the most
general of terms.
<P>

20  	I digress to mention the provisions of s 208A (2) of the Act.
It was not the subject of argument during the hearing.  Accordingly,
I do no
more than make passing reference to those provisions.
<P>

21  	The provisions purport to require the Costs Assessor to either
determine the application by confirming the Bill of Costs or
disallow or reduce
disputed costs in respect of which he is satisfied are unfair or
unreasonable.
<P>

22  	It has been said that the provision was intended to impose a
limitation on what may be disallowed or reduced in cases where
the assessment
involves a Bill of Costs.  It may also be said to have relevance to the
question of the sufficiency of the disclosure
of the reasoning process.
<P>

23  	In this case, the determination had the effect of confirming the
Bill of Costs.  By implication it could be taken to follow
that the Costs
Assessor was not satisfied that the disputed costs in this case were unfair or
unreasonable.  Depending on the circumstances
of the case, and subject to what
may be required by the regulations, a statement of confirmation of a bill of
costs may be said to
satisfy the requirement to provide reasons.  In this case,
there is no need to look to any implication.  Despite what was said in
the
subsequent letter, the Costs Assessor had in fact gone further by expressly
disclosing that he had allowed all of the fees because
he had reasoned that
they were fair and reasonable.
<P>

24  	Be that as it may, in this particular case, it seems to me that
he did sufficiently express his reasoning process (even though
this may be said
to have been done in general terms and in an economical fashion).
<P>

25  	In correspondence, the Costs Assessor stated that he had
determined that all of the fees charged by the defendant were fair
and
reasonable "in all of the circumstances of the complex matters" dealt with.  In
the subsequent letter, he informed the plaintiffs
that he had confirmed the
Bill of Costs.
<P>

26  	It seems to me that the expression of reasoning process given by
the Costs Assessor clearly and effectively rejected the one
issue which had
been litigated in the assessment (which was in effect a general one of
unfairness or unreasonableness) and stated
the grounds upon which that
rejection was based.  I am not persuaded that anything further could have been
usefully said by way of
disclosure of reasoning process.
<P>

27  	This is not a case where the appellate process has been
frustrated by inadequate disclosure of reasoning.  I should add that
even if a
different view had been taken as to the sufficiency of the expression of
reasoning process, I am not satisfied that any
shortcomings would have been of
significance.
<P>

28  	At first blush, it may seem that a large number of hours have
been expended in the performance of the work and that the Bill
of Costs is a
large one.  But these matters had to be considered in the context of all of the
material made available to the Costs
Assessor.  The work was said to be done in
respect of a commercial matter (it involved a farmer, his company and a bank).
It had
complexity.  There was a substantial volume of documentation to
consider.  Exhibits C and D reveal that documents of considerable
volume were
drafted by the defendant.  The court can only act on the material placed before
it.  In the light of that material I
am not satisfied that there is an arguable
case that the determination was not open to the Costs Assessor on the material
made available
to him.  I am not satisfied that there is any arguable error or
other matter which would justify the granting of leave to appeal.
 I am not
satisfied that justice would be best served by allowing the application.
<P>

29  	In the circumstances of this case, I am not satisfied that the
plaintiffs have demonstrated an entitlement to leave.  In these
circumstances,
there would be no utility in granting an extension of time.
<P>

30  	Some mention was made of delay and lack of explanation for
delay.  No explanation has been offered.  However, the delay was
small.  In the
circumstances of this case, these matters may not have been of significance if
a case for leave had been advanced.
 Perhaps it might also have had to be borne
in mind that if relief was granted it may cause hardship to the defendant.  The
matter
has been on foot for a long time.
<P>

31  	The Summons is dismissed.  The plaintiffs are to pay the costs
of the Summons.  The Exhibits may be returned.
