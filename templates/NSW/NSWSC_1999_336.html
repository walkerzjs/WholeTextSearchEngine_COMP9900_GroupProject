<P>

<b>COMMON LAW DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>MASTER HARRISON</b>
<P>

<b>THURSDAY, 15 APRIL 1999</b>
<P>

<b>12338/98   -   JOHN WHALEN  v  PETER McCARTHY t/as</b>
<P>

<b>			McCARTHY KILLALEA</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Appeal against decision of costs assessor)</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  By summons filed 25 September 1998 the appellant seeks to
appeal against the decision of costs assessor, Frank Riley made on 14
September
1998.  The appellant relied on his affidavit dated 2 November 1998.  The
respondent did not rely on any affidavit evidence.
<P>

2	The background facts are as follows:
<P>

(1)	In May 1997, the appellant John Whalen retained Peter McCarthy of McCarthy
Killalea a firm of solicitors (the respondent) to
act for him in relation to a
dispute between shareholders and himself . These disputes ultimately led to
proceedings being instituted
in the  commercial division of this court.
<P>

(2)	The appellant signed a costs agreement which is undated.  The agreement
stipulated that the respondent would charge at the rate
of $200.00 per hour
(para 3).  The estimate of the solicitor's charges for completing the work was
estimated to be about $50,000
and estimate of the expenses that the respondent
would incur would total about $60,000.  The work was estimated to be completed
by
April 1998 (para 3).  However the type of work to be undertaken was not
particularised.  The respondent was to send a complete bill
for charges and
expenses at the end of each month while the work was in progress and/or when
the work was completed (para 5).  The
appellant was required to pay barristers'
fees, faxes, photocopying, mail, telephone and courier expenses (para 2).  This
document
is referred to in this judgment as the "costs agreement".
<P>

(3)	On  23 June, 1997 Darvat Pty Ltd (ACN 003 957 962), the plaintiff commenced
proceedings numbered 50142/97 against Modular Manufacturers
Pty Limited (ACN
002 826 217) as first defendant, Waterproofing Manufacturing Pty Limited (ACN
070 883 484) as second defendant,
John Stewart Whalen as third defendant (the
appellant in these proceedings) and Judith Anne Whalen as fourth defendant.
<P>

(4)	On 12 September, 1997 the plaintiff's motion seeking summary judgment
against the defendants was heard.  Hunter J dismissed
the motion.
<P>

(5)	On 2 December 1997, the respondent forwarded a notice of ceasing to act to
the appellant.
<P>

(6)	On 8 December 1997, the matter was heard before Giles CJ.  The appellant
appeared unrepresented and the judgment given was not
in his favour.
<P>

3	The appellant seeks orders that the whole of the determination or decision of
the costs assessor Frank Riley issued on 14 September
1998 in respect of the
application by the plaintiff for an assessment of costs in that proceedings No
90377/98 (the determination)
be set aside on the basis that the decision is
erroneous in law.  The appellant also seeks  that leave to appeal be granted on
the
grounds that the determination is unconscionable, unfair, unjust,
unreasonable.  If an order is made setting aside the whole of the
determination, the appellant seeks that the court substitute the fair and
reasonable costs of the defendant, or alternatively  return
the proceedings to
the costs assessor for further assessment.
<P>

4	The grounds of appeal in the summons were stated to be: 
<P>

(1)	The costs assessor erred in failing to apply the proper principles
governing the assessment of costs.
<P>

(2)	The costs assessor erred in failing to give reasons for the
determination.
<P>

(3)	The costs assessor erred in awarding $25,000 profit costs to the defendant
which represented 125 hours work at the rate of $200.00
per hour.
<P>

(4)	The costs assessor erred in law in failing to have regard to the oral
agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant that
payment would be made at
the end of the proceedings (s 208B).
<P>

(5)	The costs assessor erred in law in failing to have regard to the outcome of
the matter (s 208B(f)).
<P>

(6)	The costs assessor erred in law in failing to have regard to the skill
labour and responsibility displayed on the part of the
solicitor responsible
for the matter (s 208B(a)).
<P>

(7)	The costs assessor erred in law in failing to have regard to the quality of
the work done and whether the level of expertise
was appropriate to the nature
of the work done (s 208B (c)).
<P>

(8)	The costs assessor erred in law in failing to provide to the plaintiff for
examination and comment the whole of the material
provided to the costs
assessor upon which the assessment was based.
<P>

5	Section 208L of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lpa179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b> provides:
<P>

	<b>"208L Appeal against decision of costs assessor as to matter of law</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	A party to an application who is dissatisfied with a decision of a costs
assessor as to a matter of law arising in the proceedings
to determine the
application may, in accordance with the rules of the Supreme Court, appeal to
the Court against the decision.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	After deciding the question the subject of the appeal, the Supreme Court
may, unless it affirms the costs assessor's decision:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	make such determination in relation to the application as, in its
opinion, should have been made by the costs assessor, or</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	remit its decision on the question to the costs assessor and order the
costs assessor to re-determine the application.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	On a re-determination of an application, fresh evidence, or evidence in
addition to or in substitution for the evidence received
at the original
proceedings, may be given."</b>
<P>

6	A history of the costs assessment is as follows.  There was detailed
correspondence between the costs assessor and the parties,
some of which is
summarised below.  On 22 February 1997, the appellant lodged an application for
an assessment of costs with the
registry.  On 2 April 1998, the costs assessor
wrote to the parties informing them that he had a copy of the costs agreement
(referred
to earlier in this judgment).  He also had a document entitled
"Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements re Modular Manufacturers ats
Darvat"
dated 30 September 1997 (the memorandum) before him.  The Memorandum claimed
solicitor's costs of care, skill and consideration
$20,000, conferences with
appellant (25 hours x 200), telephone attendances (30 x 70), conferences with
Counsel 10 hours at $200
and court appearances on motions 5 hours x $250, and
court appearances $750.  It also claimed faxes, telephone, typing, photostats,
couriers, DX and postage in the sum of $3,600 and barristers' fees for Ms
Stenmark $2,300 and Mr Shields $850 and it was noted (wrongly)
that these had
been paid.  A further sum of $1,500 was due to Mr D Studdy of Counsel and $300
to Mr B Cheney.  The solicitor was
seeking a total amount of $36,500.  The
costs assessor also stated that he was in possession of respondent's time
costing sheets.
 These time sheets provide a date when the service was rendered
and whether the attendance was a telephone call, conference, letter
or in
relation to the preparation of court documents.  They did not give any
information as to the subject of the attendance.  The
costs assessor noted that
time sheets could not be reconciled with the memorandum or to the costs
agreement.  He identified that
there was no reference in the costs agreement to
a charge for care, skill and consideration or for typing and paralegal costs.
The
costs assessor further noted that there was no dispute merely to the rate
of charge specified in the costs agreement, that is costs
of $200 per hour.  He
requested that in future each party was to give the other copies of any
submissions or documents made or produced
to the costs assessor.
<P>

7	In his letter of 2 April 1998 to the parties the costs assessor requested
both parties to submit any comments which they desired
to make in respect of
the respondent's time sheets and other documents or any of the issues such as
the amount of payments that the
appellant had made to the respondent.
<P>

8	The appellant responded by letter of 22 April 1998 acknowledging that he had
most of the documents that were in the appellant's
file except any documents
prepared after he had left for China in November.  He also made a detailed
response to the time sheets
of McCarthy Killalea.  The appellant highlighted
that the time sheets did not show the subject matter of work undertaken and
referred
to the lack of the solicitor's communication.  He disputed that the
solicitor had performed detailed 
<P>

legal analysis but acknowledged that most of the work was done between June and
October.  Additionally the appellant complained
that barristers were changed
from time to time and expense incurred although he did not give reason as to
why this occurred.
<P>

9	The costs assessor wrote to the parties again on 4 May 1998 requesting their
response to three questions.  In his letter to the
parties dated 7 June 1998 he
stated:
<P>

	<b>"For the purposes of the assessment I am required by section 208A of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lpa179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a> to consider -</b>
<P>

<b>	whether it was reasonable to carry out the work to which the costs
relate;</b>
<P>

<b>	whether the work was carried out in a reasonable manner;  and</b>
<P>

<b>	the fairness and reasonableness of the costs in relation to that
work.</b>
<P>

<b>	Neither the memorandum of 30 September 1997 nor the time sheets contain
sufficient particulars of the work done to indicate the nature
or purpose of
the work and permit an assessment of the related costs in accordance with
section 208A.  The time sheets list many
attendances without any accompanying
information which might explain their purpose or function, beyond the fact, in
some instances,
that the attendance involved a conference with the client or
with counsel.</b>
<P>

10	Without this detailed information being provided, the costs assessor was
faced with a difficult task.  He could not request the
respondent to provide a
more detailed bill of costs but could ask for particulars (see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lpa179/s207.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 207</a> of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lpa179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b> and <b><u>Attorney General v L G Smith &amp;
Anor</u></b> (NSWCA unreported, 4 November 1998)).  The costs assessor
attempted to overcome this problem by requesting that the respondent produce
some further documents including a chronology, the provision of specific
particulars, records retained in relation to disbursements
and briefs to
counsel and any copies of transcripts held.  Some further documentation was
provided to the costs assessor which included
time sheets and chronology.  The
costs assessor in his letter dated 20 June 1998 to the parties pointed out the
purpose and substance
of attendances were generally unexplained and even their
relationship to the chronology enclosed with the respondent's letter was
not
clear.  The appellant and the respondent subsequently agreed that the
respondent had paid $17,000 to the appellant.
<P>

11	On 22 August 1998, the costs assessor wrote to the parties.  He said that he
had completed an assessment of the costs, the subject
of this application, on
the terms noted below.  It relevantly stated:
<P>

	<b>"1.	...</b>
<P>

<b>	2.	...</b>
<P>

<b>	3.	The Applicant has disputed the costs charged in the memorandum dated 30
September, 1997, not merely as to the rate charged, and
I have previously
indicated my view (paragraph 6 of my memorandum dated 2.4.98) that I am not
precluded by Section 208C(1) from assessing
the costs the subject of the
application.</b>
<P>

<b>	4.	...</b>
<P>

<b>	5.	...</b>
<P>

<b>	6.	My determination of the Respondent's costs (ie., profit costs as
distinct from disbursements) has been made on the basis of the
information
provided in the time sheets and the hourly rate of $200.00 disclosed in the
costs agreement.  I have made deductions
from some items considered to exceed
what was fair and reasonable in the circumstances to which they related.  I
have made no allowance
for a "care skill and consideration" loading
additionally to the hourly rate disclosed as there was no provision made for
such a
loading in the costs agreement.  In respect of disbursements I will not
allow claims for typing or para-legal charges as they were
not disclosed in the
costs agreement as intended extra charges to the hourly rate or as anticipated
disbursements."</b>
<P>

12	The parties subsequently agreed to the costs assessor assessing both the
memorandum (dated 30 September 1997) and the time sheets
which claimed for work
done until 11 December 1997.
<P>

13	On 13 September 1998, the costs assessor wrote to the parties.  He
stated:
<P>

	<b>"1.	I have been notified by the Applicant that he agrees to my assessing
the costs claimed by the Respondent up to and including December
1997.  I have
accordingly assessed the costs claimed by the Respondent to 11 December,
1997.</b>
<P>

<b>	2.	The four barristers whose fees are claimed by the Respondent in the
summary of disbursements included in his time sheets have
confirmed the fees
claimed are still owing to them.  Ms Stenmark has submitted an additional
memorandum of fees but I have allowed
only the fees claimed in the time
sheets.</b>
<P>

<b>	3.	The amount of profit costs allowed in my determination is $25,000.00.
The disbursements allowed by me are as follows:</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>Counsels' fees -</b>
<P>

<b>B.A. Shields		2,500.00</b>
<P>

<b>A. Stenmark		3,815.00</b>
<P>

<b>D. Studdy			2,735.00</b>
<P>

<b>R. Cheney			<u>   350.00</u>		9,400.00</b>
<P>

<b>Photocopying					   700.00</b>
<P>

<b>Facsimiles						   500.00</b>
<P>

<b>Couriers &amp; mail				         <u>    250.00</u></b>
<P>

<b>						         35,825.00</b>
<P>

<b>Less deduction for filing fee		         <u>    365.00</u></b>
<P>

<b>Amount determined as per </b>
<P>

<b>certificate attached			       $<u>35,460.00</u>"</b>
<P>

15	On 14 September 1998 the costs assessor issued a certificate of
determination of costs.  The application was determined by substituting
for the
disputed costs as a fair and reasonable amount of costs to be paid to the
practitioner the sum of $35,460.  The certificate
noted that credit had been
given by the practitioner to the client for the sum of $17,000 paid on account
and that the amount thus
payable by the client to the practitioner was
$18,460.
<P>

16	On 14 September 1998, the appellant wrote to the costs assessor and asked
him to publish reasons for his decision so that he
might be fully able to
understand the basis of the decision.
<P>

17	On 16 September 1998, the costs assessor wrote to the parties.  He
stated:
<P>

	<b>"In response to the Applicant's enquiry of 14 September 1998 I advise as
follows:-</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>1.	The amendment to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lpa179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a> which will require the giving
of reasons for an assessment has not yet been proclaimed to commence.  Under
the existing general law
costs assessors should give reasons if requested to do
so after the issue of their Certificate of determination, but the law does
not
require a full statement of reasons in the form of a judicial
determination.</b>
<P>

<b>	2.	I have in my memoranda throughout the assessment proceedings indicated
the basis on which I was dealing with the assessment and
if either party wishes
to have further information I ask that it be made the subject of a specific
request.</b>
<P>

<b>	3.	The applicant has asked if there is a difference "between the 30th
September date and the December date."  As I pointed out in
my memorandum of 14
September, 1998, having received notification of the Applicant's approval to my
assessing the Costs claimed by
the Respondent after 30 September, 1997, I
proceeded to assess the costs claimed to 11 December, 1997.  I made my
assessment after
perusing the documents produced to me by the Respondent
including the briefs to Counsel and other material constituting the
Respondent's
file.  The fees payable to the four barristers also included fees
for work done after 30 September 1997.</b>
<P>

<b>	Of the $25,000.00 determined for the Respondent's profit costs in total
about $5,000.00 was attributed to the period 30 September
to 11 December,
1997."</b>
<P>

18	The appellant did not pursue the costs assessor's offer in relation to
reasons.  
<P>

19	I turn to the second submission as to whether the costs assessor failed to
give reasons for his determination. The appellant's
counsel referred to
<b><u>Attorney General of New South Wales &amp; Anor v Kennedy Miller
Television Pty Ltd</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%2d1998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20729" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997-1998) 43 NSWLR 729.</a>  This case was decided on
the assumption that a costs assessor was exercising an administrative function
not a judicial one.  The
issue for determination in the appeal was "whether or
not a costs assessor may be required to give reasons for his decision made
by
him when assessing costs, when the person seeking those reasons is obviously
enough contemplating an appeal to the court, either,
in respect to the question
of law, or an application for leave to bring a general appeal."  At p 733
Priestley JA (with whom Handley
JA and Powell  JA agreed) referred to Sperling
J's conclusion "that a costs assessor is bound to give reasons for his
determination,
specifying the items which have been reduced, by what amount and
for what reason in each instance."  Priestley JA stated that the
process
described by Sperling J (referred to above) set out seemed a workable method.
Priestley JA came to the view that Sperling
J's suggestions were not
impractical and need not result in costs assessments taking significantly
longer to do, or costing significantly
more.  
<P>

	<b>"One thing that both the submissions at the hearing and those continued in
the statement have made plain to me is that there is scope
for policy
guidelines to become established governing the way in which reasons are
provided.  Sperling J's suggestions already go
some distance towards that.
Some matters mentioned in the statement indicate that something more detailed
may be required in the
interests of keeping costs and time wasting to a
minimum.  Whether or not that is so does not arise for decision in the present
appeal,
where the question is the general one in respect of which leave was
granted, is there an obligation upon costs assessors to give
reasons for their
determinations?  As I have already said, my opinion is that the answer is
clearly yes."</b>
<P>

20	The defendant referred me to <b><u>Kiama Constructions Pty Ltd v
Davey</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%20639" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR 639.</a>  At p 640 Mahoney P stated that the general
principles which determine what form a judge's judgment must take are, in this
court,
well settled.  They are:
<P>

	<b>"A judge of a superior court and a court where decisions are subject to
appeal or review ordinarily should give reasons for the orders
he makes.  There
are qualifications and exceptions to this.  Reasons, or detailed reasons, need
not be given in some interlocutory
or practice decisions.  Until comparatively
recently, the High Court of Australia did not ordinarily give reasons in leave
applications.
 Ordinarily this Court does not give reasons, or detailed
reasons, in granting or refusing applications for leave to appeal to it.
 Where
the court is to give reasons and what reasons are to be given will be affected
by the nature of the case and, amongst other
things, what has been made
apparent to the parties in the course of the argument of proceeding.  The
imposition of inflexible rules
would impede the effective, efficient, timeous
and just disposal of the work of the court concerned.</b>
<P>

<b>	Where reasons are to be given, it is necessary for the court to determine
what is a sufficient statement of the reasons why its orders
were made.  What
will be sufficient reasons will depend, of course, upon the reason why it is
necessary to detail them and the circumstances
of the particular case.  As
appears from the cases to which I have referred, the court must have regard to
the need of the parties
to know what will affect their rights of appeal or
review, the natural desire of parties to know why they have won or lost, and in
some cases why the particular orders that were made were made.  In some cases,
the issues may appear, or may have become, unarguable;
in such cases there is
no need to deal with it:  see <i>QBE Insurance Ltd v Switzerland Insurance
Workers Compensation (NSW) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20ALJR%20281" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) ALJR 281</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=131%20ALR%20433" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">131 ALR 433</a>, where the
apparently unarguable was held arguable.  There may occasionally be public
interest to be served in recording the conclusions
which the court has reached
and the reasons for them: thus, in disciplinary cases such matters are
ordinarily recorded to enable
the court to deal effectively with applications
for reinstatement, re-admission or the like."</b>
<P>

21	The defendant submitted that the costs assessor disclosed his thinking to
the parties as he went along and he recorded what was
done and why and these
letters should be taken as forming part of his reasons and that these reasons
were adequate in all the circumstances.
 It is my view that I am bound to
follow the decision in <b><u>Kennedy Miller</u></b> as it specifically deals
with the issue as to whether or not a costs assessor should provide reasons.
Indisputably Priestley JA held
that a costs assessor is bound to give reasons.
He also held that the costs assessor should specify what items have been
reduced,
by what amount and for what reason in each instance.  The costs
assessor has given reasons for determining issues at various stages
as he is
entitled to do.  He had indicated that he proposed to disallow the item
referring to care, skill and consideration and those
items relating to typing
and paralegal costs.  However in his letter dated 22 August 1998 at para (6)
the costs assessor stated that
he has made deductions for some items which he
considered to exceed what was fair and reasonable but he did not stipulate
which items,
or by what amount he made these deductions.  The reason he made
deductions on unspecified items was because those items exceeded
what was fair
and reasonable in the circumstances to which they related. 
<P>

22	Normally a costs assessor would give one set of reasons at the conclusion of
the assessment.  However as this costs assessor
adopted a course of giving
reasons as he proceeded with the assessment, when the appellant requested
reasons for his determination,
the costs assessor stated that if further
information was required, it be made subject of a specific request.  In that
same reply
the costs assessor answered the specific concerns raised by the
appellant.  The costs assessor made it clear during the assessment
process the
reasons why he disallowed the items which related to care, skill and
consideration, paralegal and typing costs.  He was
entitled to do.  However,
the costs assessor has not specifically referred to the items where he made
deductions and by what amount
in his reasons to date but has stated the reason
why he made these deductions namely they exceeded the amounts he considered
were
fair and reasonable.  If a request to provide reasons is made to the costs
assessor in relation to these items, he is obliged to
furnish same.  He is not
required to replicate his reasons.  It has to be borne in mind that the purpose
of providing reasons is
to explain why particular deductions have been made and
some of these are deductions known to the parties.  The costs assessor has
not
refused to provide reasons.  The appellant, rather than seek these reasons from
the costs assessor, elected to institute this
appeal.  It is my view that the
stance the costs assessor took in relation to his reasons does not amount to an
error in law.
<P>

23	The appellant also submitted that the costs assessor failed to apply the
proper principles governing the assessment of costs
but did not demonstrate
which proper principles were not applied.  The appellant also submitted that
the costs assessor failed to
give the appellant opportunities to make written
submissions in relation to the material which was supplied to the costs
assessor
but has not been supplied to the appellant.  It is my view that this
ground has not been made out.  The costs assessor must not determine
an
application for assessment unless he has given the parties a reasonable
obligation to make submissions in relation and has given
due consideration to
the submissions made <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lpa179/s208.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 208).</a>  The costs assessor wrote to the parties
initially informing them what documents he had before him and thereafter asked
for the parties
to send copies of their submissions and supporting
documentation to the other party.  He consulted each party and asked for
submissions
each step of the way.  
<P>

24	The appellant submitted that the certificate of determination (S 208J) is
defective in that it does not mention that the costs
assessor required the
appellant to pay $9,400 worth of counsels' fees prior to enforcement.  This was
not raised in the grounds of
appeal.  It is my view that the costs assessor has
stipulated this in his letter dated 13 September 1998, paragraph (4).  There is
no provision in this certificate for the costs assessor to stipulate how much a
solicitor owes a third party.  It is my view that
the failure of the
certificate to reveal that the respondent is to pay $9,400 worth of counsels'
fees is not an error of law.  If
enforcement action is to be taken in the court
the certificate of assessment must be re-filed - see <b>Supreme Court Rules</b>
Part 40 r 12.
<P>

25	The appellant's third submission is that by allowing $25,000 profit costs
the costs assessor allowed 125 hours work at the rate
of $200 per hour.  This
does not demonstrate any error of principle.  The appellant's fourth submission
is that the costs assessor
should have had regard to the oral agreement between
the solicitor and client that payment would be made at the end of the
proceedings.
 However, s 188(4) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lpa179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b> provides
that a costs agreement is void if it is not in writing or evidence in writing.
The appellant says that although the costs
agreement must be in writing that
does not mean that oral arrangements between the parties can not be taken into
account by the costs
assessor.  The oral agreement according to the appellant
was that he was required to pay the solicitor's costs at the conclusion
of the
proceedings.  This agreement stipulated that solicitor's costs were to be paid
monthly while the work was in progress and/or
when the work was completed.
<P>

26	The alleged oral agreement does not sit comfortably with a copy of the
respondent's letter which was before the costs assessor.
 In this letter dated
27 October 1997 by the respondent addressed to the appellant it stated that the
appellant's costs situation
is accelerating weekly and his method of "drip
payment" is not keeping pace with counsels' fees and that other than a small
administrative
charge of $1,100 no payment had been made to that firm in 5
months.  By that I infer that the respondent means the solicitors' fees
as
opposed to counsels' fees.  There was a dispute before the costs assessor as to
when payments for solicitor's fees were due. 
The costs assessor was entitled
to prefer the respondent's version that the agreement as to payment of
solicitor's fees was set out
in the written document.  The appellant has not
demonstrated that the costs assessor fell into error.
<P>

27	The appellant submitted that the costs assessor was entitled to have regard
to the matters set out in s 208B in relating to the
assessment of costs.
Section 208B provides:
<P>

	<b>"Additional matters to be considered by costs assessors in assessing bills
of costs</b>
<P>

<b>	In assessing what is a fair and reasonable amount of costs, a costs
assessor may have regard to any or all of the following matters:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	whether the barrister or solicitor complied with any relevant
regulation, barristers rule, solicitors rule or joint rule,</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	whether the barrister or solicitor disclosed the basis of the costs or
an estimate of the costs under Division 2 and any disclosures
made,</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	any relevant advertisement as to the barrister's or solicitor's costs or
skills,</b>
<P>

<b>(d)	any relevant costs agreement (subject to section 208C),</b>
<P>

<b>(e)	the skill, labour and responsibility displayed on the part of the
barrister or solicitor responsible for the matter,</b>
<P>

<b>(f)	the instructions and whether the work done was within the scope of the
instructions,</b>
<P>

<b>(g)	the complexity, novelty or difficulty of the matter,</b>
<P>

<b>(h)	the quality of the work done,</b>
<P>

<b>(i)	the place where and circumstances in which the legal services were
provided,</b>
<P>

<b>(j)	the time within which the work was required to be done."</b>
<P>

28	There is no evidence that the costs assessor erred in this regard.  It is
noted that the costs assessor deducted the whole of
the amount the respondent
claimed for care, skill and responsibility.  The appellant also submitted that
the costs assessor failed
to provide to the appellant for 
<P>

examination and comment the whole of the material provided to the costs
assessor upon which the assessment was based.  The appellant
did not
demonstrate any documentation that was before the costs assessor that was not
before the appellant.  This submission fails.
<P>

29	Alternatively the appellant sought leave to appeal on the basis that the
determination was unconscionable, unfair, unjust, unreasonable
and excessive.

<P>

30	Section 208M provides:
<P>

<b>"Appeal against decision of costs assessor by leave</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	A party to an application relating to a bill of costs may, in accordance
with the rules of the Supreme Court, seek leave of the
court to appeal to the
court against the determination of the application made by a costs
assessor.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	A party to an application relating to costs payable as a result of an
order made by a court or a tribunal may, in accordance with
the rules of the
court or tribunal, seek leave of the court or tribunal to appeal to the court
or tribunal against the determination
of the application made by a costs
assessor.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	The Supreme Court or court or tribunal may, in accordance with its
rules, grant leave to appeal and may hear and determine the
appeal.</b>
<P>

<b>(4)	An appeal is to be by way of a new hearing and fresh evidence, or
evidence in addition to or in substitution for the evidence
received at the
original proceedings, may be given.</b>
<P>

<b>(5)	After deciding the questions the subject of the appeal, the Supreme
Court or court or tribunal may, unless it affirms the costs
assessor's
decision, make such determination in relation to the application as, in its
opinion, should have been made by the costs
assessor."</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

31	In <b><u>Busuttil v Holder &amp; Anor</u></b> (Master Greenwood, unreported,
9 August 1996) Master Greenwood discussed the appropriate test for leave in
costs assessment matters.
 He stated:
<P>

	<b>"Thus whilst each application for leave to appeal is to be determined on
its merits and I heed the statement of the High Court in
<i>Adam P Brown Male
Fashions Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20148%20CLR%20170" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 148 CLR 170</a> at 177, 180) that it is "unnecessary
and unwise to lay down rigid and exhaustive criteria" for the grant of leave to
appeal, as the
circumstances of different cases are `infinitely various.'"  I
can see nothing in what is before me that leads me to a conclusion
that I ought
to look to the question of leave other than to apply criteria of an obvious
error on the face of the record and substantial
injustice done to the appellant
if the determination of the costs assessor is allowed to stand."</b>
<P>

32	As previously stated the memorandum claimed costs of $36,500 to 30 September
1997.  The amount appearing on the time costing
sheets from 30 September 1997
to 11 December 1997 were taken into account by the costs assessor.  They amount
to a further sum of
$8,924.  In all the respondent sought payment of $43,624
for his costs.  This component was reduced to $25,000, just a little over
half
of what was claimed.  Aside from issue of the adequacy of the costs assessor's
reasons which I have held amounted to an error
of law, I cannot see any other
obvious 
<P>

error on the record, and as the solicitor's costs have been reduced to nearly
half that were claimed I cannot see that a substantial
injustice has been done
to the appellant if the determination of the costs assessor is allowed to
stand.  I am not satisfied that
leave to appeal should be granted.
<P>

33	The appellant has not discharged his onus of proof.  I am not satisfied that
the costs assessor has erred in law nor that leave
to appeal should be granted.
The appeal is dismissed.  The summons is dismissed with costs.
<P>

34	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The appeal is dismissed.
<P>

(2)	The summons is dismissed.
<P>

(3)	The appellant is to pay the respondent's costs.
<P>
