<P>

<b>YOUNG, J</b>
<P>

<b>TUESDAY 13 JULY 1999</b>
<P>

<b>2864/99 - OWNERS CORPORATION STRATA PLAN 22669 V SYDNEY MIDDLETON &amp;
ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>The plaintiff is the Owners Corporation
of a building at 39 Bundarra Road, Bellevue Hill.  The defendants are the
registered proprietors
of lot 5 in the relevant strata plan.  The defendants
and the plaintiff have for some time been in dispute over the payment of levies
and other matters and there has been considerable litigation between them.
<P>

2   	The plaintiff has two judgments against the defendants
obtained from the Local Court at Kogarah, together with interest and
fees.
The material before me at the moment indicates that the plaintiff would be
entitled to issue writs of execution in respect
of the judgment in case 643/96
in the sum of $49,585.57 and in matter 259/97 $35,314.92.
<P>

3   	It came to the plaintiff's attention that the defendants
were selling their unit.  The information came to the plaintiff indirectly
and
the details as to the transaction only became known to the plaintiff's camp
little by little.  However, it is now clear that
the defendants entered into a
contract in the 1992 edition of the Law Society standard form to sell the unit
for $625,000.  No agent
was involved in the deal.  I am told from the Bar table
that a notice to complete has been issued for next Wednesday 21 July 1999.
<P>

4   	The first defendant, Sydney Middleton, who describes
himself as a pensioner, made an affidavit in which he annexed as annexure
B "a
copy of conditions 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16".
<P>

5   	Today when counsel for the plaintiff called for the
contract a contract was produced in which there was an additional handwritten
clause on the same piece of paper. The position of the crossing out of cl 14
shows that it is the same piece of paper, but the absence
of the computer
identification "P.\Suzanna\.\conditio" shows that someone, in order to make the
photostat which is annexure B to
Sydney Middleton's affidavit, has made sure
that the bottom of the page was masked out.  This suggests that special
condition 17
was in the contract from at least 8 July 1999.
<P>

6   	It is not clear, however, when it was written into the
contract, though most of it is in the same rather strange coloured ink
as used
for the insertion of the purchaser's name, though there are additions in a
lighter blue pen.
<P>

7   	The effect of special condition 17 is that "notwithstanding
clause 16", a meaningless reference, the balance of purchase money
is to be
paid as to $400,000 on completion and the balance is to be secured by an
unregistered second mortgage protected by caveat
to be repaid on the first
anniversary of the completion date.  The fact that it is to be a second
mortgage suggests that the purchaser
is getting finance and the financier will
have a first mortgage.  The fact that it is to be unregistered suggests that
the first
mortgage does not permit a second mortgage without consent, which is
not going to be sought.
<P>

8   	The plaintiff commenced these proceedings on 23 June 1999
seeking virtually Mareva orders.  The summons was amended on 30 June.
 The
summons, as amended, sought a further order restraining the defendants from
mortgaging, charging or otherwise encumbering the
unit.
<P>

9   	On 29 June the plaintiff applied to the clerk of the Local
Court at Kogarah to issue writs of execution.  That application
was refused on
the basis that an appeal by way of case stated was on foot in this Court and a
recognizance had been lodged and the
clerk treated that as a stay of execution.
It has been conceded before me that that was quite wrong.
<P>

10   	The effect, however, of what the clerk did was that no
writ could be registered on the title.
<P>

11   	Mr Rollinson of counsel for the defendants said that that
really did not matter very much because in the first instance the
writ would
have to have been executed as against the personalty of the debtor and not
against the realty.  That may be so, but it
is more likely than not on the
evidence before me that apart from furniture in the unit, at least, the first
defendant would not
have the personalty to satisfy that large amount of
money.
<P>

12   	On return of the summons before this Court the first
defendant gave various undertakings.  These were accepted by Bergin J
on 25
June.  The undertakings included an undertaking that Sydney Middleton would not
sell the unit or complete any sale or dispose
of his interest in the unit
without giving ten days' notice in writing and that he would pay out of the
proceeds of sale some $28,000,
plus interest, which is the subject of a
bankruptcy notice, and the further $54,216.58 plus interest.  There were no
such undertaking
by Michael John Middleton who is Sydney Middleton's son and
the second defendant.
<P>

13   	Today the application of the plaintiff for Mareva relief
or security was vigorously resisted by the defendants.
<P>

14   	Mr Rollinson said that under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/s78.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 78(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes
Management Act 1996</a> the purchaser would become jointly and severally liable for
any debt owing in respect of a proper levy, so that even if the unit
was sold
the plaintiff would have good security and, indeed, better security because
somebody else would also have a liability to
the plaintiff.  Mr Rollinson also
said that there were various other ways in which the plaintiff could get
execution of the judgments,
and that there was no equity at all to entitle the
plaintiff to any Mareva relief and particularly to the relief sought that there
be no further encumbrance.  He said that it was against the well-known rule of
the law that creditors are not able to prevent alleged
debtors from dealing
with their property as they deem fit.
<P>

15   	On the other hand, Mr Bradford for the plaintiff put that
this Court and others of like jurisdiction have intervened on proper
occasions
to make sure that people are not able to evade their judgment debts and that in
appropriate cases the court will intervene
by Mareva orders or otherwise.
<P>

16   	In the present case there are both judgment debts from the
Local Court at Kogarah and there are also claims which have not
come to
judgment.  The plaintiff did not know before today (though why it is not clear)
that there is in fact a registered mortgage
over lot 5 to Suncorp-Metway
Limited.  The only significance of that mortgage is that it is not an
inter-family transaction.  The
mortgage is stamped on the basis that it is
collateral for some other instrument, which has not yet been produced, and is
stamped
for a security up to $216,440.  Although I formally excluded the
evidence it would seem that the defendants are alleging that some
$330,000 is
owing under that security.
<P>

17   	Courts of Equity have been able to interfere at the suit
of creditors for a long period of time.  The original jurisdiction
was by
creditors' bill.  Pomeroy's<b> Equity Jurisprudence</b> 5th ed
(Bancroft-Whitney Co,<b> </b>1941, San Francisco) vol 4 pp 1065 and following
says that:
<P>

"The jurisdiction of Equity to entertain suits in aid of creditors undoubtedly
had its origin in the narrowness of the common-law
remedies by writs of
execution."
<P>

18   	The history of creditors' bills up until 1816 is given in
the decision of the Chancery Court in New York in<b> Wiggins v Armstrong</b>
(1816) 2 Johnson's Chancery 144, where the notes set out most of the references
to that time.
<P>

19   	Chancellor Kent said in his judgment, referring to various
English decisions, that a creditor at large, that is a creditor
who had not got
a judgment, was not given relief, but where the creditor had completed his
title at law Equity would intervene and
Equity would also intervene where the
creditor had done the best he could to perfect his title at law.  He said at pp
145-6:
<P>

"The reason of the rule seems to be that until the creditor has established his
title, he has no right to interfere, and it would
lead to an unnecessary and,
perhaps, a fruitless and oppressive interruption of the exercise of the
debtor's rights.  Unless he has
a certain claim upon the debtor he has no
concern with his frauds."
<P>

20   	The main cases referred to are first an unreported
decision of Lord Nottingham, which is cited in argument before Parker LC
in<b>
Balch v Wastall</b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1718/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1718] EngR 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281781%29%201%20P%20Wms%20445" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1781) 1 P Wms 445</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=24%20ER%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">24 ER 465</a>, where under the maxim
frustra fit per plura, quod fieri potest per pauciora, if one has a judgment,
and has lodged a fieri facias
in the sheriff's hands, to which a nulla bona was
returned, the creditor could bring a bill in Equity against the defendant to
discover
any of the goods or personal estate of the defendant and that was
Equity making sure that the creditor was not frustrated by the
technicality of
the Common Law.  However, Parker LC in<b> Balch's</b> case refused to deal with
a case where the defendant had in fact been outlawed.
<P>

21   	The same sort of case occurred before Lord Hardwicke in<b>
Bennet v Musgrove</b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1750/216.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1750] EngR 216</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281750%29%202%20Ves%20Sen%2051" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1750) 2 Ves Sen 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=28%20ER%2034" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">28 ER 34</a>, where the creditor
proceeded in Chancery after choosing to execute for his judgment debt against
the debtor's land by writ of elegit.
<P>

22   	These cases came to light recently in the seminal decision
of the Supreme Court of the United States in<b> Grupo Mexicano De Desarrollo SA
v Alliance Bond Fund Inc</b> 17 June 1999 as yet unreported.
<P>

23   	 The history of creditors' bills was dealt with in the
majority opinion at p 10 and the decision in<b> Wiggins v Armstrong</b> was
affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States.  The minority view given by
Ginsburg J linked the subsequent developments
by way of Mareva with the
principles of the jurisdiction that were exercised by the Chancellor in 1789
(the date of the separation
of America from England).  The majority said that
there was no right to Mareva relief in a Federal Court in 1789 because debtors'
bills only lay where there was a judgment debt.
<P>

24   	A creditors' bill then lay where there was a judgment debt
and where the creditor required the assistance of Equity in view
of the
inadequacies of execution at Common Law.  A creditor could obtain under a
creditors' bill, discovery as to what the defendant's
assets were, so that he
could get an idea as to what property could be the subject of execution.  A
creditor could get execution
over  equitable property which could not be the
subject of an execution at law.  Also a creditor could get relief where the
debtor
had been involved in fraudulent conveyances which might affect the
creditor's right to execute.  Some of those matters are now covered
directly by
the Supreme Court Rules, such as examination of judgment debtors, but the
balance of the jurisdiction is still there,
though in reserve.
<P>

25   	When Mareva orders were formulated in about 1975, they
were built on to the existing structure of a bill in Equity. One of
the first
cases in which a Mareva order was sought after judgment is<b> Faith Panton
Property Plan Ltd v Hodgetts </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20WLR%20927" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 WLR 927</a>, where at p 933 Waller LJ
said there was no need to apply the decision in <b>Mareva Compania Naviera SA v
International Bulk Carriers SA </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20All%20ER%20213" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 All ER 213</a> because the ordinary
jurisdiction of the court was sufficiently wide to protect the creditor.
<P>

26   	In<b> Balfour Williamson (Australia) Pty Ltd v Douter
Luigne</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%202%20NSWLR%20884" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 2 NSWLR 884</a>, Sheppard J had no doubt that this Court had
jurisdiction to make an order in the nature of Mareva after judgment had been
obtained.
 The Supreme Court of Western Australia took the same view in<b>
State Bank of Victoria v Parry</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20WAR%20240" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] WAR 240</a>, 254-5, and again in<b>
Yamabuta v Tay (No 2)</b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2016%20WAR%20262" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 16 WAR 262</a>; see also<b> Jet West Ltd v
Haddican</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20WLR%20487" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 WLR 487.</a>
<P>

27   	The High Court has recently considered the application of
Mareva orders both after judgment<b> Pelechowski v Registrar Court of
Appeal</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] HCA 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20162%20ALR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 162 ALR 336</a>, and generally<b> Cardile v LED Builders Pty
Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20162%20ALR%20294" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 162 ALR 294.</a>  In the<b> Pelechowski </b>case at p 348 para 52
the High Court was quite clear that the District Court could in very limited
circumstances make an asset preservation
order for a limited period, though it
said it had no jurisdiction generally to do so.  In the <b>LED Builders
case</b> at p 311 (paras 52-53) the High Court emphasised that this sort of
order really is ancillary and care must be taken to make sure
both that third
parties are not prejudiced and also that appropriate ancillary orders are made
to ensure that a plaintiff getting
this sort of order does not just rest on its
laurels, but moves for its primary relief.   The court also indicated that it
was good
practice to make sure that a Mareva order was limited so that third
party transactions, particularly with banks and commercial financiers
were not
unduly affected by the order, and that it was prudent usually to add a
paragraph dealing with such protection, other than
the protection of
transactions by the defendants or members of their family or relatives.
<P>

28   	The Court of Appeal in the leading case on Mareva relief
in this State<b> Patterson v BTR Engineering (Aust) Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2018%20NSWLR%20319" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 18 NSWLR 319</a>
made it clear that Mareva orders were flexible and that they were to be
available in a wide range of cases to prevent people from
abusing the processes
of the court.
<P>

29   	The High Court in<b> LED Builders</b> p 310 para 50
said:
<P>

"There is a temptation to use the term 'flexible' to cloak a lack of analytical
rigour and to escape the need to find a doctrinal
and principled basis for
orders that are made."
<P>

30   	However, in the instant case there is history over two
hundred years supporting the basic proposition of the plaintiff, that
it is an
entity with a judgment debt and other claims, and that prima facie on the
evidence the first defendant has been making some
endeavours to use the
processes of appeal, preventing service by locking himself inside his secure
unit, by the handwritten cl 17,
and otherwise, to see that the ordinary
processes do not reach him.  That is the very type of case where Equity does
intervene.
<P>

31   	However, Equity only intervenes up until the time that the
regular processes are able to be put in train.
<P>

32   	It is foreshadowed that the sale of unit 5 will take place
on Wednesday of next week, if that is when it does take place.
 It may be that,
on settlement, there will be sufficient moneys to pay the plaintiff's debts.
On the other hand, there is some danger
that that might not happen, and there
is also some danger that even between now and the 21st something else may
occur.
<P>

33   	It will be necessary, if the settlement moneys do not
produce what is needed, for the plaintiff to reactivate its application
in the
Kogarah Local Court, which in view of these reasons for judgment might well
next time be successful.  The plaintiff may then,
as Mr Rollinson suggests it
should, execute against the personalty, and failing that the realty of the
debtor, but the plaintiff
should not be put in a situation that all these time
consuming exercises have to take place whilst the defendants can do what they
like.
<P>

34   	Accordingly, in my view, the proper order is that the
court records that the plaintiff is entitled to a lien over the property
5/SP22669 to secure a sum of up to $166,700, and the court will review that
order and consider any other application that the creditor
has, such as for
discovery, next Tuesday 20 July 1999.  That order may be taken out forthwith
and may be registered.
<P>

35   	Subject to the defendants supplying to the plaintiff a
photocopy, Ex PX01 can be released to the defendants.  That copy of
exhibit is
to be made available within 24 hours.
<P>

36   	The proceedings are adjourned to my list at 9.50 am on 20
July 1999.
<P>
