<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiffs own the property 112-116 Campbell
Parade, Bondi Beach, folio identifier 2/5953, on which they wish
to erect a
five storey building.  The defendant owns the property adjoining the
plaintiffs' property to the south, namely 108 Campbell
Parade Bondi Beach,
folio identifier 3/5953, on which is erected a private hotel known as "The
Biltmore".  The plaintiffs say that
in order to erect their building they need
certain temporary easements over the defendant's property, and in these
proceedings they
seek an order under s.88K of the Conveyancing Act granting
these easements.  
<P>

2  	I will commence with a brief history of the dealings between the
parties.
<P>

3  	Prior to December 1998 there was erected on the plaintiffs'
property a four storey block of flats.  This building extended to
the southern
boundary of the plaintiffs' property, that is the boundary adjacent to the
defendant's property, for the first ten metres
from the street frontage, and
also for the last seven metres to the rear of the property, and to about one
metre from that boundary
for the next twelve metres after the first ten metres
from the street.  It seems that this building extended to the northern boundary
for the whole of the length of that boundary.
<P>

4  	The building on the defendant's land has its northern wall at a
distance of about 1.115 metres from the plaintiffs' southern
boundary.  On the
area between the defendant's building and the plaintiffs' southern boundary,
there is a paved passage which is,
amongst other things, a fire exit passage.
There is evidence that between about 1995 and about the end of November 1998
there were
substantial renovations effected to the defendant's building,
including the installation of a sprinkler system and a new fire escape
which
leads to this passage.
<P>

5  	In February 1998, the plaintiffs obtained a building approval for
their proposed new building, and they subsequently entered
into a building
contract with Austruc Constructions Ltd for a price of $3.3 million.  
<P>

6  	On 17 November 1998, Austruc wrote a letter to George Verebes,
the principal of the defendant, attaching a report concerning
the demolition
and construction phase of the plaintiffs' project, and showing the safety
scaffolding which would be required, including
scaffolding extending into the
defendant's property.  The letter went on to request permission to erect that
scaffolding for four
weeks for the demolition of the existing building, and for
thirty weeks during the construction of the new building.
<P>

7  	According to Mr Verebes, some time in November 1998 he conveyed
to the plaintiffs' architect, Alex Smith, that he would agree
to the
scaffolding for the four weeks, but was not sure about the scaffolding for the
building phase.
<P>

8  	On 2 December 1998, there was a letter written by Simon Wakerman,
an architect acting on behalf of the defendant, to Mr Smith,
confirming the
permission to erect the scaffolding on the basis of a payment of $500 per week
for four weeks and $1,000 per week
for any additional week, and other
conditions set out in that letter.
<P>

9  	On 3 December 1998, Mr Smith replied, in substance agreeing with
those conditions.  It appears that between about 4 December
1998 and 24
December 1998 this scaffolding was in place for the demolition.  It may be that
the demolition itself took a little longer,
because in a letter dated 10 March
1999 Mr Fenwick, Austruc's construction manager, asserted that the demolition
was completed on
15 January 1999.
<P>

10  	On 8 January 1999, Mr Verebes wrote a letter to Bill
Katakouzinos, the plaintiffs' son, complaining about the demolition of
the
security fire exit door to the passage and damage to the pathway along the
passage, and other matters resulting from demolition
work.  On 6 March 1999, Mr
Wakerman wrote to Mr Fenwick concerning excavation which had taken place on the
plaintiffs' property,
claiming that it had led to erosion from the defendant's
property and damage to the path and an associated drain.  The evidence makes
it
clear that Mr Verebes was not satisfied with the response made to these
complaints on behalf of the plaintiffs.  
<P>

11  	On 14 April 1999, Mr Smith wrote to Mr Wakerman enclosing
details of the proposed scaffolding for the construction phase. 
According to
these proposals, the scaffolding would have no contact with the ground, but
would, in effect, project from the first
floor upwards and would project to a
maximum of seven hundred millimetres into the defendant's property.
<P>

12  	On 25 May 1999, Mr Wakerman wrote to Mr Fenwick complaining
about cracks appearing in the facade of the Biltmore Hotel, and
claiming that
this was caused by the work on the plaintiffs' land.  
<P>

13  	It appears that in about early July 1999, there was a
conversation between Mr Verebes and Bill Katakouzinos, where Mr Katakouzinos
said words to the effect that the plaintiffs would soon be needing the air
space rights for the scaffolding for the construction
phase.  It appears that
Mr Verebes said words to the effect that he had not seen the April letter, to
which I referred, but, in any
event, he went on to say that he would not
consider the grant of air space rights until the plaintiffs had addressed the
problems
which had been raised by letters such as those to which I have
referred.
<P>

14  	On 28 July 1999, the plaintiffs' solicitors wrote to the
defendant requesting an agreement for the use of the scaffolding,
offering $500
per week for such agreement and referring to s 88K of the Conveyancing Act.
The letter advised that the builder wished
to commence construction in about
three weeks.  
<P>

15  	Mr Verebes replied by a letter of 12 August 1999, in which he
advised, amongst other things, that access to air space would
be granted only
after the existing  problems had been dealt with.  In their reply of 13 August
1999. the plaintiffs' solicitors asked
for a document setting out all the
defendant's concerns, and Mr Verebes responded with a letter of 16 August 1999
summarising his
complaints and seeking a written commitment that all the
matters raised would be repaired.
<P>

16  	The plaintiffs' solicitors responded to this by a letter of the
same day seeking confirmation as to their understanding of
the complaints, and
also requesting advice as to what compensation the defendant thought
appropriate for use of the air space.
<P>

17  	On 18 August 1999, Mr Verebes wrote to the plaintiffs'
solicitors indicating that he would supply a report concerning compensation
"if
and when appropriate" and seeking, amongst other things, $100,000 security in
relation to his complaints about damage to his
property.
<P>

18  	Over the next week or so, many letters were exchanged between
the plaintiffs' solicitors, on the one hand, and Mr Verebes and
the defendant's
solicitors, on the other hand, without any resolution.  Among other things, Mr
Verebes and his solicitors required
the actual payment of $2,000 before the
solicitors would give, and Mr Verebes would receive, any advice concerning
s.88K.
<P>

19  	In one letter dated 25 August Mr Verebes wrote:
<P>

<b><i>"I do not propose to take an extortionary attitude and will be satisfied
with a reasonable weekly payment payable 30 weeks in advance
together with
simultaneous execution of agreements."</i></b>
<P>

However, in general terms it was conveyed that this would be considered only
when the other problems had been dealt with to Mr Verebes'
satisfaction.
<P>

20  	Further letters were written by the plaintiffs' solicitors to Mr
Verebes on 28 August and 31 August 1999, the latter enclosing
a draft licence
agreement with amendments that had been suggested by Mr Verebes.
<P>

21  	It appears that on 31 August 1999. Mr Verebes telephoned Mr
Bushby, the plaintiffs' solicitor, and said words to the effect
that if the
plaintiffs wanted the use of the defendant's air space before the other
problems had been resolved, he would require
payment of $5,000 a day.
<P>

22  	These proceedings were commenced on 7 September 1999, and the
substantial hearing took place on 5 October 1999.  After that,
there were
written submissions, and oral submissions on 18 October.
<P>

23  	The evidence discloses a lease of a restaurant on the
defendant's property to Palzet Pty Ltd.  That company had been notified
of the
proceedings, and the principal of that company has indicated that it did not
wish to be involved.
<P>

24  	There is also evidence that the defendant has leased the
remainder of its property to Brampt Pty Ltd, by a lease commencing
4 October.
However, as I understand, it is common ground between the parties that I can
ignore that lease, and treat any question
of affectation and compensation as if
the defendant was the only party involved.
<P>

25  	The issues that need to be considered are essentially those
which arise from the terms of s.88K of the Conveyancing Act which
as
follows:
<P>

<b><i>The Court may make an order imposing an easement over land if the
easement is reasonably necessary for the effective use or development
of other
land that will have the benefit of the easement. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(2)   Such an order may be made only if the Court is satisfied that:
</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(a)   use of the land in accordance with the easement will not be
inconsistent with the public interest, and </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(b)   the owner of the land to be burdened by the easement and each other
person having an estate or interest in that land that is
evidenced by an
instrument registered in the General Register of Deeds or the Register kept
under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act 1900</a> can be adequately compensated for any loss or
other disadvantage that will arise from imposition of the easement, and
</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(c)   all reasonable attempts have been made by the applicant for the
order to obtain the easement or an easement having the same
effect but have
been unsuccessful. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(3)   The Court is to specify in the order the nature and terms of the
easement and such of the particulars referred to in section
88 (1) (a)--(d) as
are appropriate and is to identify its site by reference to a plan that is, or
is capable of being, registered
or recorded under Division 3 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p23" class="autolink_findacts">Part 23.</a> The
terms may limit the times at which the easement applies. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(4)   The Court is to provide in the order for payment by the applicant
to specified persons of such compensation as the Court considers
appropriate,
unless the Court determines that compensation is not payable because of the
special circumstances of the case. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(5)   The costs of the proceedings are payable by the applicant, subject
to any order of the Court to the contrary. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(6)   Such an easement may be: </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(a)   released by the owner of the land having the benefit of it, or
</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(b)   modified by a deed made between the owner of the land having the
benefit of it and the persons for the time being having the
burden of it or (in
the case of land under the provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act 1900</a>) by a
dealing in the form approved under that Act giving effect to the modification.
</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(7)   An easement imposed under this section, a release of such an
easement or any modification of such an easement by a deed or dealing
takes
effect: </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(a)   if the land burdened is under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act 1900</a>, when the
Registrar-General registers a dealing in the form approved under that Act
setting out particulars of the easement, or of
the release or modification, by
making such recordings in the Register kept under that Act as the
Registrar-General considers appropriate,
or </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(b)   in any other case, when a minute of the order imposing the easement
or the deed of release or modification is registered in
the General Register of
Deeds. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(8)   An easement imposed under this section has effect (for the purposes
of this Act and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act 1900</a>) as if it was contained in a deed.
</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(9)   Nothing in this section prevents such an easement from being
extinguished or modified under section 89 by the Court.</i></b>
<P>

26  	The first issue is whether the easement sought by the plaintiffs
is reasonably necessary for the effective use or development
of the plaintiffs'
land.
<P>

27  	The second issue is whether the proposed use is inconsistent
with the public interest.
<P>

28  	The third issue is whether the defendant can be adequately
compensated for any loss or other disadvantage that would arise
from the
imposition of the easement, and if so, what is that compensation.
<P>

29  	The fourth issue is whether all reasonable attempts have been
made by the plaintiffs to obtain the easement.
<P>

30  	Finally, there is the question as to whether the court in its
discretion should grant an easement, and if so, what conditions
should be
imposed.
<P>

31  	I will deal first with the question of reasonable necessity.

<P>

32  	It is not disputed that, if the building is to go ahead as
planned by the plaintiffs, there must be safety scaffolding of the
kind
proposed and thus, unless the defendant consents to that scaffolding, there
must be an easement as sought for the scaffolding.
 It is also not disputed
that, if the building is to go ahead as planned, there is need for access for
limited purposes connected
with completion of the brickwork of the wall on the
boundary, as set out in the summons.
<P>

33  	The real question is whether there are alternatives to going
ahead with the building as planned, which do not require these
easements and
which are such that the easements needed for the building as planned should not
be considered as reasonably necessary
for the effective use or development of
the plaintiffs' land.
<P>

34  	Some evidence on this question was given by Mr Smith. He gave
evidence that the cost of the work to date was about $1.154 million;
and that
it had taken about eighteen months for the development application to be
approved, and a further eight months for the building
application to be
approved.  He also gave evidence that without the easements it would be
necessary to re-design the building to
make the southern walls at least 0.9
metres back from the boundary, which would in turn reduce the number of
apartments in the building
from seventeen to thirteen; reduce three apartments
from two bedrooms to one bedroom; and reduce the penthouse from three bedrooms
to two bedrooms.  The re-design itself would cost $20,000, and it would take a
further four to six months to obtain development and
building approval.
According to Bill Katakouzinos, this would render the development financially
marginal.  
<P>

35  	The plaintiffs' contention was essentially that this evidence
established reasonable necessity.  The truth of this evidence
was not
challenged by the defendant, but it was submitted to be insufficient to show
reasonable necessity.
<P>

36  	On these and other matters, the parties provided extensive
written submissions, which I will leave with the papers, and I will
be brief in
outlining the submissions in these reasons.
<P>

37  	For the defendant, it was submitted that it was insufficient for
reasonable necessity that avoidance of the need for an easement
would reduce
the number of units in the  plaintiffs' building.  It was submitted that the
court would not lightly interfere with
the defendant's property rights.
Reference was made to the statement by Young, J. in<b> </b><u>Hanny v Lewis</u>
[1999] NSW Conv R 55-879, to the effect that s.88K does not exist to permit
people to build to their boundary or without adequate
access and then expect
others to make their land available for them.  It was also submitted that, to
make out a case of reasonable
necessity, a plaintiff should act reasonably by
taking into account the need for easements and seeking consent prior to
obtaining
development and building approval.
<P>

38  	As regards the appropriate test for reasonable necessity, I
adhere to what I said on that matter in<b> </b><u>117 York Street Pty Ltd v
Proprietors of SP 16123</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20504" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 504</a> at 508-9 as follows:
<P>

<b><i>It is clear that "reasonably necessary" in s.88K(1) does not mean
"absolutely necessary", and thus that the requirement may possibly
be satisfied
even when the plaintiff's land could be effectively used or developed without
the easement:  </i><cite>Tregoyd Gardens v. Jervis</cite><i> (Hamilton, J. 25
September 1997, unreported); </i><cite>Goodwin v. Yee Holdings Pty.
Ltd.</cite><i> (Windeyer, J. 6 November 1997 unreported); </i><cite>Re Seaforth
Land Sales Pty Ltd's Land (No.2)</cite><i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20Qd%20R%20317" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) Qd. R 317.</a></i></b>
<P>

<b><i>In my opinion:  (1) the proposed easement must be reasonably necessary
either for </i><cite>all</cite><i> reasonable uses or developments of the land,
or else for some one or more proposed uses or developments which are (at least)
</i><cite>reasonable</cite><i> as compared with the possible alternative uses
and developments; and (2) in order that an easement be reasonably necessary for
a
use or development, that use or development </i><cite>with</cite><i> the
easement must be (at least) substantially preferable to the use or development
</i><cite>without</cite><i> the easement.</i></b>
<P>

39  	I adhere also to the view which I expressed in the same case
that reasonable necessity must be considered at the time the proceedings
are
brought, so that even if there had been unreasonable conduct at some earlier
stage by the plaintiffs, this would not necessarily
mean there was not
reasonable necessity at the time of the proceedings, although prior
unreasonable conduct could go to the court's
discretion.  In any event, in this
case I would not find it unreasonable for the plaintiffs not to have sought and
obtained agreement
prior to obtaining development or building approval.
<P>

40  	A development of the general kind which the plaintiffs are
undertaking is, in my opinion, a reasonable development, and there
is no
suggestion of any alternative use or development which would not require an
easement, apart from the original building which
has now been demolished, or a
development of a similar type with the building set back 0.9 metres from the
boundary.
<P>

41  	In my opinion, the plaintiffs' proposal is substantially
preferable to the latter alternative, substantially for the reasons
put
forward.  The alternative would involve a significant loss in residential
accommodation, significant delay and significant cost
in re-design, and would
render the development financially marginal.  It would also create a gap of
little practical use.
<P>

42  	I do agree with the observations made by Young, J. in
<u>Hanny</u> that s.88K does not mean that people can build to their boundary
and then expect others to make land available.  However, that consideration
has
much more weight in cases like<b> </b><u>Hanny</u> itself, where what is sought
is not a temporary easement during construction but an easement imposing a
permanent burden on other
land.  In my opinion, reasonable necessity has to be
assessed having regard to the burden which the easement would impose.  In
general
terms, the greater the burden the stronger the case needed to justify a
finding of reasonable necessity.
<P>

43  	In this case, for reasons I will give, the easement sought would
have a significant impact on the defendant, but the impact
is temporary and,
again for reasons I will give, can be compensated.  On the whole, I think a
case of  reasonable necessity is made
out.
<P>

44  	I turn now to the question of public interest.  
<P>

45  	For the defendant a building surveyor, Mr Koloadin, gave
evidence that the scaffolding erected over the defendant's property
would
increase fire risk.  The flammability of shade cloth required to cover the
scaffolding, and the susceptibility of that shade
cloth to arson, would involve
a risk of fire and also smoke damage to the defendant's building.  According to
Mr Koloadin, it would
restrict access to the windows along that side of the
defendant's building by fire services.
<P>

46  	The defendant also relied on evidence that the damage to the
path had already been caused, and partial obstruction of the path
already
prejudiced the fire safety of the defendant's building.
<P>

47  	Mr Koloadin also gave evidence that the scaffolding would remove
natural light from the windows and would severely reduce the
availability of
fresh air.
<P>

48  	The defendant also relied on evidence to the effect that injury
caused on the defendant's property by the plaintiffs' activities
would not be
covered by the defendant's insurance.
<P>

49  	For the plaintiff, evidence was given by Mr Eadie, a person with
some expertise in fire safety protection.  His evidence was
to the affect that
the use of "Weathershade" shade cloth would make the risk involved with the
flammability of the shade cloth insignificant.
 Furthermore, according to Mr
Eadie, the scaffolding could in fact enhance access by fire services to windows
on the defendant's
property, because those windows could not safely be accessed
by use of a ladder from the pathway.
<P>

50  	The plaintiff also relied on evidence from Mr Fenwick that the
scaffolding would be erected progressively over twelve weeks,
going up one
level approximately each three weeks; would be fully erected only four to five
weeks; and would progressively come down
over a period of three to four
weeks.
<P>

51  	Mr Aitken for the defendant submitted that I should prefer Mr
Koloadin's evidence to that of Mr Eadie, and that having regard
to the
significant reduction in fire safety that the scaffolding would involve, and
the substantial reduction in light and air to
the defendant's building, I
should be satisfied that the use of the land in accordance with the easement
would be inconsistent with
the public interest.
<P>

52  	In my opinion, on the question of fire safety, the evidence of
Mr Eadie should be preferred.  He had carefully considered the
question of
flammability of the particular shade cloth proposed to be used, and I accept
his evidence that the fire risk from that
shade cloth would be insignificant.
I also accept his evidence that at least access to windows by fire services
would not be prejudiced.
<P>

53  	The plaintiffs have offered to accept a number of conditions to
ensure that fire safety would not be prejudiced, namely that
"Weathershade"
shade cloth be used; that the plaintiffs pay for weekly maintenance on the
defendant's smoke alarm and sprinkler system
during the term of the easement;
that the plaintiffs install at their expense a one way self-locking door in the
fence on the defendant's
western boundary to provide additional egress from the
defendant's building; and that the plaintiffs ensure that no scaffolding comes
into contact with the defendant's building or attachments to it.
<P>

54  	Interpreting that last condition as including shade cloth
attached to the scaffolding, I consider that, subject to the acceptance
of
those conditions, the use of the land in accordance with the easement, whether
that land is regarded as dominant or servient land,
would not be inconsistent
with the public interest in relation to matters of fire safety.
<P>

55  	In relation to the reduction of light and air, in my opinion the
rooms most affected would be those close to the scaffolding
and without a front
or rear window, but even in relation to those rooms the evidence does not show
there would be any danger to health.
 When I come to discuss compensation I
will find that some damage to the defendant's business would be involved but,
in my opinion,
that does not justify a finding of inconsistency with the public
interest.
<P>

56  	As I understand it, no submissions were made concerning
insurance.  In any event, I note that the plaintiffs are prepared to
undertake
to include the defendant in their insurance policy up to a limit of $10
million.
<P>

57  	I come now to the question of compensation.  
<P>

58  	The manager of the Biltmore, Mr Millar, gave evidence concerning
complaints and difficulties in renting rooms during December
1998, when the
scaffolding was in place for the demolition.  His evidence was to the effect
that he was offering discounts, which
appear to be between about ten to twenty
percent of the rentals for relevant rooms, and that still people were cutting
short their
intended stay.  There was other evidence to the effect that two or
three people per day were checking out, and that Mr Verebes gave
an instruction
that thirty percent discounts could be offered.
<P>

59  	Mr Verebes provided a calculation supporting a claim for about
$150,000 for the work's thirty week period.  In substance the
calculation was
on the basis that thirty of the hotel's rooms would be affected, the total
rental value of these being $1,495 per
day.  Mr Verebes estimated that, as a
result of the erection of scaffolding as proposed, fifteen percent of these
rooms would not
be used, giving a figure of $224.  In addition, there would be
early check-outs, giving a further figure of $150.  Of the remainder,
he
estimated that sixty percent of the total would require a discount of about
thirty percent, giving a further $269, these amounts
totaling $643 per day, or
about $4,500 per week.  In addition, he estimated there would be additional
loss on the premium rates which
could otherwise be charged over the four days
around New Year 2000, and on the increased rates which could otherwise be
charged during
the lead up to the Olympic Games after 30 June 2000.
<P>

60  	Mr Verebes also gave evidence that he would expect the return
from the hotel to increase by about ten percent a year, particularly
following
the renovation of the hotel; and he gave evidence that he would expect the
detriment to the hotel's business to continue
for some time after the
scaffolding was removed, in that it would take some little time for the
business to recover to its usual
level.
<P>

61  	There is in evidence before me daily summary sheets  showing
amounts paid, and the rooms and number of days in respect of which
those
amounts were paid, for the month of December in 1997 and 1998; and also a
schedule prepared by the plaintiffs on the basis
of similar summary sheets,
showing comparisons between November 1997 and November 1998, December 1997 and
December 1998, January
1998 and January 1999, and February 1998 and February
1999.  As I understand it, it is accepted that these comparison summaries are
accurate as regards the takings, though not accurate in relation to the room
occupancy, because it seems they did not take into account
the number of days
for which various payments were made.
<P>

62  	There is also in evidence some tables prepared by the defendant
purporting to show trends over various months. There was evidence
given by Mr
Verebes which I take to mean that the defendant did have a book from which the
vacancies of particular rooms on particular
days could be established; but that
book was not produced by the defendant, although in my opinion its production
was required by
a notice to produce served on the defendant.
<P>

63  	For the plaintiff, evidence was led by a valuer to the effect
that the easements were worth $500 per week; but that appeared
to be based
purely on the arrangement previously made between the parties.  It was
submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that I should
accept $500 per week as an
appropriate figure for compensation.  It was submitted that I should reject Mr
Verebes' evidence, because
of his evasiveness in the witness box and the
failure to produce records.
<P>

64  	The plaintiffs submitted that at best one could find the
possibility of a loss of around $150 per day, and that, treating the
matter as
a chance of such loss, as discussed in <u>Sellars v Adelaide Petroleum</u>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20179%20CLR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 179 CLR 353</a>, this also confirmed $500 per week as appropriate
compensation.
<P>

65  	For the defendant, it was submitted that the onus was on the
plaintiffs to establish what was appropriate compensation.  It
was submitted
that I should accept Mr Verebes' evidence, in that the case had been brought on
urgently at the insistence of the plaintiffs,
so the lack of production of
adequate accounting evidence and other materials was not to be criticised.  I
was referred to<b> </b><u>Wengarin Pty Ltd v Byron Shire Council</u><b>
</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/485.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWSC 485.</a>  It was submitted that it was appropriate to include in
the compensation some element of the plaintiffs' profit from having an
easement.
<P>

66  	In my opinion, the onus does lie on the plaintiffs to show that
the defendant can be adequately compensated.  In my opinion,
this means that
there is an onus on the plaintiffs to show, first, what loss or other
disadvantage the defendant will suffer, and
secondly, that this loss or
disadvantage can be adequately compensated.  However, in deciding whether this
onus has been discharged,
it is appropriate to take into account that the
relevant facts are essentially within the knowledge of the defendant.  
<P>

67  	In my opinion, Mr Verebes was evasive in the witness box, and
even taking into account the urgency of the hearing, the explanation
for not
producing the primary records which apparently existed of vacancies occurring
during the previous period of the scaffolding,
was  unsatisfactory.  Having
regard to this, and having regard to the self-interest involved in his
evidence, and also having regard
to the lack of any clearly stated basis for
the estimate made by Mr Verebes, other than his experience in the hotel
business, I find
myself unable to give very much weight to those estimates.  On
the other hand, it seems to me that the evidence of the plaintiffs'
valuer,
based as it was on what had happened in relation to the demolition phase, is of
no help.
<P>

68  	The table prepared by the plaintiffs shows that the rent
received in November 1998 was on average $322 less per day than in
1997; the
rent received in December 1998 was on average $406 less than the rent received
in December 1997; that received in January
1999 was on average $162 per day
less than in January 1998; and that received in February 1999 was on average
$434 a day less than
in February 1998.
<P>

69  	The evidence is that renovations were completed at about the end
of November 1998, and it is possible that those renovations
could account for
the decreased rents in November 1998.  It is possible that the $406 per day
reduction in December 1998 was substantially
contributed to by the existence of
the scaffolding.  The decline in January 1999 could be due to the fact that the
demolition was
not fully completely until some time in January, and also to the
lagging effect or delay in recovery referred to by Mr Verebes.
<P>

70  	The decline in February 1999 is less easy to understand.  It may
be again due to the business not recovering, although one
would have thought
that this effect would be less pronounced in February 1999 than in January
1999.  The declines recorded by those
figures may in fact be insufficient to
fully reflect whatever factors were impacting on the business at that time.
Although the figures
and graphs produced do not support Mr Verebes' estimate
that ten per increase in business per year would be reasonable, it would
in my
opinion be reasonable, especially having regard to the renovations, to expect
that, other things being equal, the takings would
increase from year to year,
and in particular increase as a result of the renovations.  Even if one takes
only five percent as an
expected improvement between December 1997 and December
1998, that would involve an expected increase of $137 per day for that period,
which would make the full decline in December 1998 an amount of something like
$543.
<P>

71  	I think that, having regard to the onus that lies on the
plaintiffs, it is reasonable to start from this figure of $543 a day,
and then
to discount it substantially, something like fifty percent, on the basis that
some of this decline was probably due to the
demolition itself, or the fact
that there was a building site next door, rather than just the existence of the
encroaching scaffolding,
and also because the February figures suggest the
possibility of other unexplained causes, and also because for, the construction
phase, the scaffolding would not be to the full height over the whole
period.
<P>

72  	There is the consideration that December is, on the evidence,
one of the best months for the defendant's business; but it seems
to me that
this, to some extent, cuts  both ways in that the stronger the demand, the less
likely it is that there will be vacancies
or a need for a discount, whereas in
the other months it could be said that a percentage loss would involve a lesser
loss.  It is
also appropriate to take into account that, but for other factors,
the passage of a further year might be expected to involve an
improvement in
the defendant's business, perhaps of the order of five percent.
<P>

73  	Taking all these matters into account, taking into account the
fact that the onus is on the plaintiffs, but also taking into
account that the
defendant has not provided material which it could have provided, in my opinion
the loss or other disadvantage that
would arise from the imposition of the
easement is essentially a loss or disadvantage to the business which can
reasonably be quantified
at $300 per day or $2,100 per week.  In my opinion,
that loss would continue from the time the easement is imposed to five weeks
after the scaffolding has been completely removed.  In my opinion, no
additional loss or damage would be caused by the other easement
contemplated by
the plaintiffs' application.
<P>

74  	The next question is whether all reasonable attempts have been
made to obtain the easement.  
<P>

75  	For the plaintiffs, it was submitted that early notice had been
given in November 1998.  The scaffolding had been re-designed
to lessen the
impact on the defendant and notice of this given in April 1999.  There was
extensive correspondence seeking agreement
between July and early September
1999.  Compensation had been offered consistent with the previous compensation.
The defendant had
been requested to put a figure claiming compensation and had
failed to do so.
<P>

76  	For the defendant, it was submitted that the plaintiffs had
acted in a high-handed and belligerent way, and that the defendant
had acted
reasonably in requiring the other problems caused by the plaintiffs' activities
to be dealt with before the defendant considered
the grant of the easement,
particularly in circumstances where the plaintiffs never responded properly to
the defendant's complaints.
<P>

77  	In my opinion, although some of the defendant's complaints
concerning trespass were justified, the substance of the impasse
that occurred
was that the defendant was requiring the plaintiffs to accede to all its
demands, without adjudication of their justification,
before the defendant
would address the question of the grant of an easement or licence.  I do not
think the plaintiffs' unwillingness
to accede to the defendant's demands
without adjudication of their merit was unreasonable, and in those
circumstances I am satisfied
that the plaintiffs have made all reasonable
attempts to obtain the easement.
<P>

78  	Finally, there is the question of whether the easement should be
granted and, if so, on what conditions.  It was submitted
for the defendant
that it should be refused because of the plaintiffs' conduct, and that if it
were granted it should be on the strictest
conditions concerning fire safety,
security, reinstatement of the existing damage, and on these conditions the
defendant would seek
to be heard further.
<P>

79  	The plaintiffs have submitted conditions to which they are
willing to be subjected if the court grants the easement, as set
out at the
conclusion of their written submissions.  In my opinion, those conditions are
reasonable.
<P>

80  	There should in addition be a condition concerning the
defendant's complaints about damage from the plaintiffs' activities.
 As I
understand it, some security has already been provided by the plaintiffs
against their liability for such damage.  In my opinion,
there should be a
condition of the easement that the plaintiffs undertake to pay to the defendant
the amount which appropriately
reflects any damage to the defendant's property
caused by the demolition and construction work on the plaintiffs' property,
such
amount to be determined in a manner agreed between the parties or, in
default, as directed by the court, and that the plaintiffs
pay such amount
within a very short period of that determination.
<P>

81  	In my opinion, the other condition should be substantially as
proposed by the plaintiffs, but in addition there should be compensation
at the
rate of $300 per day from the grant of the easement to five weeks after the
scaffolding is finally removed.
<P>

82  	On the question of costs, I will express a tentative view.  I
adhere to what I said in<b> </b><u>117 York Street</u> that the defendant in
such cases is not automatically entitled to indemnity costs.
<P>

83  	In this case, the defendant has conducted very vigorous
adversary litigation and has displayed some unreasonableness in its
conduct in
dealing with the records of the hotel.  My tentative view is that this is not
sufficient to disentitle the defendant to
the costs to which it is prima facie
entitled under s.88K.  The defendant has in fact had some success on the amount
of compensation,
and there is some merit in the defendant's submission that it
had problems in presenting its case at an urgent hearing granted for
the
benefit of the plaintiffs.  My tentative view is that the plaintiffs should be
ordered to pay the defendant's costs of the proceedings.
<P>

84  	I direct the plaintiffs to serve draft short minutes on the
defendant by 5pm today, and stand the matter over to 2 o'clock
on Thursday, 21
October with a view to making the orders then.
<P>
