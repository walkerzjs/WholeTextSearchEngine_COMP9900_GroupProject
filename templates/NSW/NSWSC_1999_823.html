<b>12 August 1999</b>
<P>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>

1   	The issue before me is one that has increasingly pressed
upon courts in recent times.  It is how the interests of justice should
be
balanced between the parties, when one party belatedly seeks an indulgence.  Is
there room in our overcrowded courts for consideration
of the interests of
other litigants and the public interest?  Are individual justice and court
efficiency necessarily in conflict?
 Here belatedly one party seeks the
indulgence of amending its defence, proffering an amount for the resultant
costs;  the other
party contends that this could not adequately compensate it
for the prejudice it would suffer were the indulgence granted.  The indulgence
sought by the Second Defendant is leave to amend its defence by pleading the
limitation period.  It seeks to do so over a month after
close of evidence and
at the end of oral addresses.  It proffers all costs that the Plaintiffs would
suffer by reason of such leave
being granted.
<P>

2   	It is important at the outset to identify whether prejudice
would thereby be suffered and, if so, its extent and whether adequately
compensable by cost indemnity.  The cases, including most recently the High
Court in <i>State of Queensland v JL Holdings</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20189%20CLR%20146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 189 CLR 146</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20141%20ALR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997)
141 ALR 353</a> provide some guidance. But they provide no mechanical algorithm
such as, that where the availability of costs are an adequate recompense
it
<i>automatically</i> follows that the indulgence should be granted, important
though that factor be.
<P>

3   	What of the interests of other litigants waiting for their
cases to come on -- the public interest in the efficiency of the
courts,
jeopardised by too ready a willingness to grant such indulgences, causing cases
to escalate in time and cost?  <i>JL Holdings</i> in the High Court did not
overrule the earlier decision in <i>Sali v SPC</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20116%20ALR%20625" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 116 ALR 625</a> at 629.
There the High Court said that the trial judge:  
<P>

"is entitled to consider claims by litigants in other cases awaiting hearing
... as well as the interests of the parties ...  What
might be perceived as an
injustice to a party when considered only in the context of an action between
parties may not be so when
considered in a context which includes the claims of
other litigants and the public interest in achieving the most efficient use
of
court resources."
<P>

4   	This is not to be understood as an automatic elevation of
court efficiency over individual justice to the parties.  Rather
it is a factor
to be taken into account with other relevant considerations as they bear upon
the interests of justice overall.  As
Sir Anthony Mason said, in a recent paper
on "the Future of Adversarial Justice" given on 7 August 1999 to the Australian
Institute
of Judicial Administration:
<P>

"There is no inconsistency between the two decisions.  The criticism of <i>JL
Holdings</i> seeks to elevate case management values to an absolute.  No system
with pretensions to doing justice could allow that to occur. 
The departure
contemplated in <i>JL Holdings</i> is predicated on the availability of costs
as an adequate recompense, though it is now accepted, and properly so, that
courts have
been too ready to conclude that procedural failures can be made
good by an order for costs.
<P>

It may be that <i>JL Holdings</i> has been misinterpreted by some judges as an
authority for excessive leniency.  If so, appellate courts should ensure that
the correct
approach is adopted as a counter to the tendency already mentioned.
There is no need for legislative intervention and it is by no
means clear what
the appropriate legislative intervention would be."
<P>

<b>APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES TO PRESENT APPLICATION</b>
<P>

5   	When comparing the facts of <i>JL Holdings</i> to those
presently before me there are some important differences.  In <i>JL
Holdings</i>, the primary judge refused leave to the defendants to amend their
defence on one ground (though allowing leave on other grounds)
after earlier
amendments and interlocutory hearings.  The reason given was to avoid vacation
of the date for hearing, estimated to
take four months.  Although the defence
was fairly arguable, the judge in a case managed jurisdiction considered that
maintaining
the date for hearing was a more pressing consideration --
mistakenly as the High Court held.  The party in breach of a timetable
stipulation in a case managed jurisdiction was thus entitled by the High Court
to pursue a fairly arguable point, having raised it
not at the last minute, as
here, but six months before the date of the trial;  any prejudice to the other
side could be cured by
an order for costs.  This was because the parties were
not small individuals for whom the stress of prolonged litigation could be
expected to loom large.  One was the State of Queensland and the other a large
developer.  The High Court considered that the principles
of case management
were not an end in themselves.  They were to be subordinated to permitting a
party properly to present its case
by granting it the necessary indulgence to
do so, where costs adequately compensated the other party for any prejudice.
If one were
to take into account the interests of litigants in other cases
awaiting hearing, their position was not in truth prejudiced to any
material
extent.  This was because there would have been ample time to fill the vacated
hearing dates in the ensuing six months.
<P>

6   	What has here essentially occurred is that an engineer
defendant was sued in tort for negligent design concurrently with an
architect
defendant.  Only the architect invoked the limitation period.  The engineer
defendant now seeks, at the close of oral submissions
following detailed
written submissions and well after the close of evidence, to plead the same
limitation defence thus prolonging
the trial and adding to costs.  The
Plaintiffs constitute an individual and his small incorporated business
bringing action with
the apparent concurrence and backing of an insurance
company.  The Plaintiffs will suffer prejudice if the indulgence is granted,
though the Second Defendant contends that the proffered costs will adequately
compensate.  
<P>

7   	I am satisfied that much of that prejudice may be met by an
order for costs but certainly not all.  The residual prejudice
is significant.
It can fairly be assumed to include the strain of further prolongation of
litigation.  If the leave to amend were
allowed, the Plaintiffs would need then
to have the opportunity to present full argument (and evidence) relating to the
Plaintiffs'
pre-trial attitude to settlement of these proceedings, affected as
the Plaintiffs assert by the absence of a limitation defence from
the engineer.
The Rules inhibit an elaboration of that assertion at this point.  But the
potential prejudice does not stop there.
 The Plaintiffs' counsel has conducted
the case throughout on the assumption that the defence for the engineers was to
be conducted
on merit, and that limitation periods were not invoked, whether
for commercial reasons or because the engineer was confident on the
issue of
liability, or both.  The Plaintiffs' counsel, while fairly acknowledging the
difficulty of dealing with these matters with
the vision of hindsight, asserts
that the way he conducted his clients' case including cross-examination was
materially influenced
by those considerations.  I have no reason to doubt that.
While the Defendant Engineer invites the Plaintiffs now to conduct such
further
cross-examination or submit such further evidence as would correct the
Plaintiffs' position to what it should have been had
the defence been pleaded
at the outset, the Plaintiffs decline to do so.  The Plaintiffs say that
correction is now impossible. 
It would itself be prejudicial and in ways that
an indemnity for the extra costs could not compensate.  I have no basis for
doubting
the Plaintiffs in that conclusion.
<P>

8   	All that is quite apart from the material consideration of
concern for court efficiency in further extending the time this
case has
already taken compared to what it should have taken with timely pleading.
There is also the consequential impact that has
on the interests of other
litigants with cases awaiting hearing.
<P>

9   	Courts have acknowledged that in the past judges have been
too ready to conclude that procedural failures can be made good
by an order for
costs; see <i>Ketterman v Hansel Properties Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%20AC%20189" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] AC 189</a> at 220: 
<P>

"But justice cannot always be measured in terms of money and in my view a judge
is entitled to weigh in the balance the strain the
litigation imposes on
litigants, particularly if they are personal litigants rather than business
corporations, the anxieties occasioned
by facing new issues, the raising of
false hopes, and the legitimate expectation that the trial will determine the
issues one way
or the other.  Furthermore to allow an amendment before a trial
begins is quite different from allowing it at the end of the trial
to give an
apparently unsuccessful defendant an opportunity to renew the fight on an
entirely different defence.
<P>

Another factor that a judge must weigh in the balance is the pressure on the
courts caused by the great increase in litigation and
the consequent necessity
that, in the interests of the whole community, legal business should be
conducted efficiently.  We can no
longer afford to show the same indulgence
towards the negligent conduct of litigation as was perhaps possible in a more
leisured
age.  There will be cases in which justice will be better served by
allowing the consequences of the negligence of the lawyers to
fall upon their
own heads rather than by allowing an amendment at a very late stage of the
proceedings."
<P>

10   	This observation was preceded by Lord Griffiths' critical
observations about invoking a defence of limitations so late in
the day.  This
was not to indicate that to do so was automatically precluded.  Rather it was
to place proper emphasis on how rarely
a court should exercise such a
discretion favourably.  Thus at 219 he said:
<P>

"... I have never in my experience at the Bar or on the Bench heard of an
application to amend to plead a limitation defence during
the course of the
final speeches.  Such an application would, in my view, inevitably have been
rejected as far too late. ... A defendant
does not invariably wish to rely on a
defence of limitation and may prefer to contest the issue on the merits.  If,
therefore, no
plea of limitation is raised in the defence the plaintiff is
entitled to assume that the defendant does not wish to rely upon a time
bar ...
If both parties on this assumption prepare their cases to contest the factual
and legal issues arising in the dispute and
they are litigated to the point of
judgment, the issues will by this time have been fully investigated <b>and a
plea of limitation no longer serves its purpose as a procedural bar</b>.
<P>

If a defendant decides not to plead a limitation defence and to fight the case
on the merits he should not be permitted to fall
back upon a plea of limitation
as a second line of defence at the end of the trial when it is apparent that he
is likely to lose
on the merits.  Equally, in my view, if a defence of
limitation is not pleaded because the defendant's lawyers have overlooked the
defence the defendant should ordinarily expect to bear the consequences of that
carelessness and look to his lawyers for compensation
if he is so minded."
[emphasis supplied]
<P>

11   	Lord Woolf in his interim United Kingdom report on "Access
to Justice" of June 1995 refers to that past practice of over-ready
indulgence
in the following paragraph, presaging the tougher attitude that is likely to be
exhibited by English courts following
the introduction of the Woolf Rules for
civil procedure.
<P>

"Where it does become apparent (often at a late stage and sometimes at trial
itself) that facts have not been adequately pleaded,
the courts are reluctant
to penalise parties substantively (for example, by preventing them from
pleading and arguing a particular
point) for what tend to be seen still as
technical faults.  The belief dies hard that procedural failures can be made
good, so far
as the other party is concerned, by an appropriate award of costs.
In fact, such awards are rarely adequate to compensate parties
for delay or
added inconvenience and, coming as they do after the event, have little effect
on behaviour."
<P>

12   	In Australia we have not yet explicitly invoked as an
overriding principle the Woolf requirement of proportionality quoted
below from
the Civil Procedure Rules of 1999:
<P>

<b>"THE OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE</b>
<P>

1.1	(1)	These Rules are a new procedural code with the overriding objective of
enabling the court to deal with cases justly.
<P>

(2)	Dealing with a case justly includes, so far as is practicable -- 
<P>

(a)	ensuring that the parties are on an equal footing;
<P>

(b)	saving expense;
<P>

(c)	dealing with the case in ways which are proportionate -- 
<P>

(i)	to the amount of money involved;
<P>

(ii)	to the importance of the case;
<P>

(iii)	to the complexity of the issues; and
<P>

(iv)	to the financial position of each party;
<P>

(d)	ensuring that it is dealt with expeditiously and fairly; and
<P>

(e)	allotting to it an appropriate share of the court's resources, while taking
into account the need to allot resources to other
cases."
<P>

13   	Nonetheless that objective finds some parallel in the
approach that courts should take when weighing matters bearing upon
their
discretion to grant indulgences.  Indeed it is already to be discerned in a
number of recent cases; for example <i>A H and R N Grundy v J B Lewis and
others</i> (Cooper J, Federal Court, 21 September 1998, unreported)  The
present case is between parties who are not major corporations or governments.
It has already taken, for proper reason, a considerable number of days.  Its
hearing should not be prolonged merely because one party
with experienced legal
advisers through inadvertence fails to plead a defence in timely fashion, more
especially a limitation defence.
 Such an approach is not punitive.  It is
based on the interests of justice firstly as between the two parties and then
the public
interest overall in ensuring that the courts with their limited
resources are efficient and fairly available for all litigants. 
The primacy of
justice between the parties does not preclude consideration of the public
interest where the former does not decisively
favour granting the
indulgence.
<P>

14   	This case has been transferred from a specialised
jurisdiction of the now merged Commercial Division. Legal practitioners
in it
know and understand that requirements are heightened for conduct of litigation
efficiently and expeditiously;  see for example
Cole J in <i>Technical Team
Products v Noble Dunn</i> (1990) 20 NSWLR 221 at 229; Rogers CJ Comm D refusing
a late limitations amendment in <i>Mehta v Commonwealth Bank of Australia</i>
(Rogers CJ Comm D SCNSW, 7 May and 27 June 1990, unreported); Sheppard J in
<i>Commissioner of Taxation v Brambles Holdings Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2028%20FCR%20451" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 28 FCR
451</a> at 455.  Practice Note 100 provides a regime for directions to ensure the
"just, quick and cheap disposal of proceedings".  Such
principles have not been
tempered by the High Court decision in <i>JL Holdings</i> in circumstances such
as these.
<P>

15   	It remains for me to consider a matter raised by counsel
for the Engineer as to the circumstances in which raising the defence
was
overlooked (T, 9July 99 at 33(30-36)).  
<P>

16   	The Defendant Engineer contends that guided by Pt 20 r1(2)
of <i>Supreme Court Rules</i> I should grant the indulgence sought, as a
necessary amendment justified because the evidence prompting it emerged for the
first
time during the cross-examination of Mr Bailey, the First Plaintiff, on
11 May 1999.  This evidence was as to the time at which Mr
Bailey first became
aware of the defects of the building from his seeing a report dated 9 May 1992;
see T, 41, 42 and 51 where counsel
for the Architect (the First Defendant)
cross-examines Mr Bailey on that question.
<P>

17   	But even accepting that this was when that evidence first
emerged, this is not an application made at the conclusion of Mr
Bailey's
evidence around 11 May 1999 but even more belatedly on 9 July 1999, two months
after.  Furthermore, the Engineer had at
the outset of the case on discovery,
the very report with its date of 9 May 1992 outside the limitation period which
was the subject
of the cross-examination.  That should have been enough to
alert the engineer with his experienced legal advisers to the
<i>possibility</i> of a limitation defence, especially as the architect had
pleaded it from the outset;  further cross-examination would simply have
tested
the tenability of that defence.  That report as the Engineer must have known
had been furnished to the solicitor for the Plaintiffs
in relation to
proceedings then on foot against the builder.  It should have been readily
appreciated that such a report would therefore
have been known about by the
solicitor who could be expected to pass on its contents to Mr Bailey, though
the precise time this occurred
is properly a matter of evidence.  The Plaintiff
would require actual knowledge of the report to be in a position to act upon it
and it was to this that the cross-examination was directed.  It is therefore
not a case where, through any lack of candour on Mr
Bailey's part, the Engineer
can find justification for failing to plead the limitation defence in timely
fashion and more especially
some months <i>after</i> 11 May 1999.  At 11 May
1999 the Plaintiffs' position may indeed have been different, in terms of the
forensic choices open, compared
to the much later date (9 July 1999), well
after evidence had closed, when leave to amend was only then first sought.
<P>

<b>Summing up</b>
<P>

18   	By way of general observation, in weighing up the overall
interests of justice in the present circumstances, it can fairly
be said that
even indemnity cost orders proffered to the Plaintiffs for any extra costs
arising from the late amendment if granted,
could not adequately compensate for
the prejudice that the Plaintiffs would suffer if the indulgence were granted.
To that factor
is to be added the lateness with which the matter has been
raised.  Then there are considerations of court efficiency and the interests
of
other litigants waiting for their cases to be heard.  Those interests would not
ordinarily outweigh the legitimate claims of justice
by a party seeking an
indulgence.  But where such claims are not decisively in favour of the party
seeking the indulgence, then such
public interest factors may certainly be
taken into account against the party seeking the indulgence and may be decisive
in the other
direction.  Nor is there necessarily any incompatibility between
the public interest and the interests of justice between the parties.
 That is
illustrated by the delay factor.  Where there is lengthy delay by the party
seeking the indulgence, that is a factor which
goes both to the claims of
justice between the parties and to the broader public interest.  It points
against granting the indulgence
sought, its relative impact depending on the
circumstances.
<P>

<b>ORDERS AND COSTS</b>
<P>

19   	I refuse the application by the Second Defendant to amend
and order that the Second Defendant pay the Plaintiffs costs on
the application
to amend.
