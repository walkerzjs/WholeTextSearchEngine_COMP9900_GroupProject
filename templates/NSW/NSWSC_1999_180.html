<u>Tuesday 9th March 1999</u>
<P>

<b><u>NO. 2890 OF 1998</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>STONE    V.    STONE</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:   I am dealing with an application brought in proceedings which
were commenced on 22nd June 1998 by Statement of Claim.
 In the Statement of
Claim, the plaintiff in substance sought to set aside a transaction whereby he
transferred a house property
to his daughter, the defendant, albeit reserving a
life estate to himself.  The Statement of Claim is based on undue influence,
unconscionability
and the like.  
<P>

2	At the time of the commencement of the proceedings, the plaintiff was aged
95, and he died about three months later on 18th September
1998.  The defendant
put on a Defence (essentially denying undue influence and unconscionability and
the like) on 31st July 1998.
 It now appears that, prior to the commencement of
the proceedings, the plaintiff had sworn an affidavit on 10th June 1998,
containing
the major factual allegations on which his claim is based.  It seems
clear that that affidavit was not brought to the attention of
the defendant
until 5th January this year, about three and a half months after the plaintiff
had died.
<P>

3	The application I am dealing with is an application brought by the defendant
for an order pursuant to s.135 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> that the Court refuse to
admit that affidavit as evidence in these proceedings.  Essentially, the basis
of the application is a claim
that it would be unfair to admit the affidavit,
in circumstances where the affidavit was available at the time when the
defendant
could have arranged for the cross-examination of the plaintiff, but
was withheld from the defendant until after the plaintiff had
died.
<P>

4	Miss Needham for the applicant submits that in those circumstances, it can be
seen, at this stage, that the evidence would be
unfairly prejudicial to the
defendant within the meaning of s.135 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>; and that when one
has regard to the medical state of the plaintiff suggested by the evidence at
the time he made the affidavit,
and the denial of cross-examination to the
defendant, its probative value would be substantially outweighed by the danger
that the
evidence would be fairly prejudicial to the defendant.
<P>

5	Miss Needham submitted that it was appropriate that that ruling be made at
this stage, because if it was not, the defendant would
suffer the prejudice of
having to answer the material in the affidavit and be subject to
cross-examination on her answer, whereas
because of the lack of opportunity to
cross-examine, the defendant should not have to answer that material at all.

<P>

6	Miss Needham referred me to a detailed chronology of events in these
proceedings, which include the plaintiff's making an application
for
interlocutory relief on 11th September 1998, supported by numerous affidavits,
but not including that of the plaintiff.  She
pointed out that particulars had
been sought by the defendant on 7th July last year, questions about the
plaintiff's capacity had
been raised in a letter from the defendant's solicitor
on 4th August, and that the plaintiff's solicitor had, on 8th September,
proposed
directions for the filing of affidavits.  Over this whole time, no
mention was made that the plaintiff had already sworn an affidavit,
and so the
opportunity that the defendant would have had to arrange for cross-examination
was lost when the plaintiff died on 18th
September.  
<P>

7	Miss Needham submitted that the probative value of this evidence was not in
any event great, having regard to the state of health
of the plaintiff, what
she submitted were internal inconsistencies in the affidavit, and the vagueness
of the evidence about signing
documents.
<P>

8	Miss Needham referred me to the case of <u>Lane v. Jurd (No.2)</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2040%20NSWLR%20708" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 40
NSWLR 708</a>, dealing with the situation where a witness had died prior to the
hearing.  She referred particularly to the statement of McLelland,
CJ in Eq.
that a rule of Court cannot make admissible was the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> says is not
admissible, and she submitted that under s.135 of the Act, this material should
be ruled as not admissible.
<P>

9	Mr. Dowdy for the plaintiff has provided a written outline of submissions
which I will leave with the papers.  He submitted that
in substance this was an
application for determination of a separate question under Pt.31 of the Supreme
Court Rules, and that a
case was not made out for the determination of such a
question.  Further, he submitted that it was not appropriate to apply s.135
except in the context of the actual hearing of a case.  He submitted that there
was an established practice of this Court to receive
an affidavit, although the
deponent had died after it was sworn; and he submitted that that probably was,
in effect, preserved by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.9</a> and 11 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>.
<P>

10	In any event, he submitted that a case was not made out for excluding the
evidence under s.135.  The case would be heard by a
judge who could then make a
decision under s.135, and, if the affidavit was admitted, give it appropriate
weight.  There was no unfair
prejudice to the defendant.  The defendant was a
party to the transactions with which the affidavit deals, and she was fully
aware
of the relevant circumstances.
<P>

11	I do not propose to decide this application on the ground that it could
never be appropriate to rule in advance as to whether
or not an affidavit
should be admitted.  It seems to me conceivable that if an affidavit of a
witness was withheld from the other
party where this was the only evidence of
important matters, where the party holding back that affidavit knew the witness
was dying
and intended to avoid having the witness's evidence tested by
cross-examination, and where, unless that affidavit was excluded, the
other
party would be put to great expense to refute it, it seems to me possible that
the Court might decide in advance that the party
not be permitted to rely on
that affidavit.  It may be that the basis of such a decision would not be s.135
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>, but rather an inherent jurisdiction of the Court to
prevent an abuse of process.
<P>

12	However, it seems to me that the facts in this case fall very far short of
those facts that I have postulated.  It is not alleged,
much less proved, that
there has been any deliberate withholding of the affidavit in order to deprive
the other party of an opportunity
to cross-examine.  The opportunity which
allegedly has been lost must be considered, in my view, a very doubtful one.
Even if the
affidavit had been made available by, say, some time in July, it
seems very questionable to me whether cross-examination on commission
would
have been ordered until the defendant had put on material showing precisely
what was in issue.  If cross-examination was to
be permitted of a person in a
medical condition which the evidence suggests the plaintiff was in, in my
opinion the Court would have
been very astute to ensure that the
cross-examination be limited to matters which had been shown in an appropriate
way to be really
important.  It seems to me unlikely that that could have
happened in time before the death of the plaintiff.
<P>

13	Next, there was other material in the case that will plainly require answer
by the defendant.  For example, there is an application
for a new Certificate
of Title signed by the deceased, asserting the loss of the Certificate of
Title, a very short time after a
facsimile communication to him from his
solicitor advising that the solicitor was holding that Certificate of Title.
The only material
before me at present to suggest that the matters asserted in
the affidavit are really disputed is a sworn Defence, which I have to
say is,
in vital respects, evasive.  It denies an allegation of nil consideration
without saying what the consideration was.  It
denies certain particulars,
including particulars alleging no independent legal advice, no explanation, and
improvidence, without
giving any indication what independent legal advice was
alleged, what explanation was alleged, or what about the transaction which,
on
its face, was for nil consideration, made it other than improvident.  The
Defence denies that the entry into a mortgage was unknown,
without giving any
indication of how it was known.  It alleges that there was benefit from the
mortgage to the plaintiff, without
saying what that benefit was.  Apart from
that Defence, there is no other material from the defendant to suggest exactly
what is
in issue in the plaintiff's affidavit.  
<P>

14	In those circumstances, it seems to me that a case certainly is not made out
for restraining the use of the affidavit as an abuse
of process.  So far as
s.135 is concerned, it seems to me that it is very doubtful whether it would be
appropriate to apply that
section so as to reject evidence in advance of the
hearing.  As submitted by Mr. Dowdy, it requires a balancing exercise which can
generally only be properly undertaken at the hearing.  However, even if it is
in some cases appropriate to do that, I am not satisfied
that it would be
appropriate to do it in this case.
<P>

15	For those reasons, I propose to dismiss the application.
<P>

16	The orders that I make are these.
<P>

17	I dismiss the defendant's Notice of Motion filed 22nd February 1999.
<P>

18	I order that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of this Notice of
Motion.
<P>

<center>(Application made for indemnity cost)</center>
<P>

19	I am not prepared to make any order for indemnity costs.
<P>

20	I stand the matter into the Registrar's list on 16th March 1999 for
directions.
