<b><u>70054/98 - REGINA v Brian John ROBSON</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  On 2 July 1999 the prisoner, Brian John
Robson, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter in October 1997 of Ronald Charles
Brotherton.
 He had been charged with murder and the Crown accepted his plea in
discharge of the indictment.
<P>

2  	During 1997 the prisoner, his wife and their children lived in a
house in Moruya.  The deceased was out of a job and addicted
to alcohol and
illegal drugs.  He prevailed upon the prisoner and his wife, Mrs Thirza Robson,
to let him live at their house.  During
the few months that he lived there, the
deceased used heroin, and that fact became known to the principal of the school
attended
by the children and to other local authorities.  The question was
officially raised whether the children were being properly looked
after.  At
this, the prisoner and Mrs Robson required the deceased to leave the house, and
he did so.
<P>

3  	The prisoner and Mrs Robson were not well off.  She was the owner
of a car which, though it was not of great value, was important
to the family.
The prisoner had worked on it from time to time.  Not long after he left the
household, the deceased returned to the
house without permission, stole the
keys to the car, took the car and drove it until it left the road and sustained
substantial damage.
 He appears to have been under the influence of alcohol at
the time.  On the following morning he went to the prisoner and Mrs Robson
and
told them what he had done.  The prisoner told him to leave.  Some time later,
the deceased visited them again and said that
he would pay for the damage.
They did not take him seriously because over the months that he had lived with
them he had never paid
board or repaid their generous hospitality in any way,
notwithstanding promises to do so.
<P>

4  	The prisoner told Mrs Robson that someone should teach the
deceased a lesson.
<P>

5  	The deceased, who had a history of committing criminal offences,
went to live with a couple called Martin Strahan and Leanne
Holmes.  Whilst he
lived there, he involved himself in theft and they in turn asked him to leave.
By the time of the events that
followed, the deceased was living in a house
owned or occupied by a man called Terry Shipley in a rural district about ten
kilometres
from the Robsons' house.
<P>

6  	One day, according to the evidence of Mrs Robson, which I find
reliable in this respect, she and the prisoner were at their
house with Mr
Strahan and Miss Holmes.  The prisoner and Mr Strahan left in a car and Mrs
Robson and Miss Holmes remained at the
house.
<P>

7  	It is common ground that the prisoner found the deceased at Mr
Shipley's house and savagely punched him a number of times. 
The deceased died.
It is not necessary for present purposes to come to any conclusion about what
part, if any, was played by Mr Strahan.
<P>

8  	The prisoner wrapped the body in tarpaulin, put it into the boot
of a car, took it to a remote place in the bush and dumped
it.  The tarpaulin
was still with the body when it was found several months later.
<P>

9  	Soon after he returned home, the prisoner told Mrs Robson that he
had punched the deceased and accidentally killed him.  As
a result of what the
prisoner or Mr Strahan told her, she believed that the prisoner and Mr Strahan
had been involved in the death
and that Miss Holmes' car had been used to take
the body and dump it in bushland.  The tarpaulin which she and Miss Holmes had
put
into the boot of Miss Holmes' car had been used for the purpose.
<P>

10  	After the prisoner told her what had happened to the deceased,
Mrs Robson must have been in some agony of mind and she kept
the matter to
herself.  Eventually, however, she found herself unable any longer to do so and
informed a social worker and was referred
to the police.  That is how her
statement came to be made.
<P>

11  	The prisoner was arrested and interviewed by the police.  I
shall refer later on to what he told them.
<P>

12  	The prisoner gave evidence, and the central part of his account
was that he had punched the deceased a number of times, not
intending to do him
grievous bodily harm.  His counsel submits that his act was unlawful and
dangerous.  The nature of the offence
to which the prisoner has pleaded guilty
requires an acceptance of that evidence and that submission.  I propose to
sentence the
prisoner accordingly, even though I do not accept his account as
complete and truthful in every respect.
<P>

13  	The prisoner said in evidence before me that during the four or
five hours before he went to Mr Shipley's house he had drunk
the contents of a
bottle of whisky.  I accept that this was so.
<P>

14  	The prisoner said that he went to the house intending only to
try to get money to repair his car and had no intention of assaulting
the
deceased.  I think that the prisoner may well have wanted to take whatever
chance he had of collecting money, but I think that
he had a good idea that he
would be the one to teach the deceased a lesson.  I think that he intended to
assault the deceased.
<P>

15  	The resentment of the prisoner about the way the deceased had
used him, his wife and family is understandable, but his reaction
was entirely
unjustified.
<P>

16  	Dealing with the circumstances of the assault itself, the
prisoner told the Court that an argument arose between the two men
when the
deceased rejected the assertion that the car had been written off.  According
to the prisoner, the deceased was under the
influence of alcohol and behaved
aggressively towards him, threatening him and throwing the first punch.  I
accept that the deceased
probably behaved in some such manner.
<P>

17  	The prisoner told the Court that Mr Strahan telephoned Leanne
Holmes and asked her to bring a tarpaulin from the prisoner's
house.  That was
one of a number of versions which might explain how he came by the
tarpaulin.
<P>

18  	It differs from the statement of facts tendered by consent at
the commencement of the evidence.  According to that statement,
the prisoner
telephoned Mrs Robson, who asked Miss Holmes to take a tarpaulin to the
property.  Miss Holmes did so.
<P>

19  	The prisoner's evidence accords with the statement of Mrs
Robson, who said that Miss Holmes asked for a tarpaulin, without
explaining
why.  Mrs Robson found one and helped Miss Holmes put it into the boot of her
car.
<P>

20  	The final version comes from what the prisoner told the police,
namely that he had obtained his own tarpaulin from Mr Shipley's
house, where he
had left it three weeks earlier.
<P>

21  	I am satisfied that the prisoner deliberately told the police a
false story, intending to protect Mr Strahan and Miss Holmes.
 I think that
either the prisoner or Mr Strahan telephoned Miss Holmes from Mr Shipley's
house to ask for the tarpaulin to be brought.
 I am unable to say which man
made the request.
<P>

22  	The prisoner said in evidence that he and Mr Strahan wrapped the
body in the tarpaulin, put it in the boot of Miss Holmes'
car and took it into
the bush.  That was all Mr Strahan's idea and it was Mr Strahan who threw the
body in the bush.  The prisoner
stayed in the car.  I cannot say whether this
was an accurate summary, but I am satisfied that the prisoner played a part in
disposing
of the body.
<P>

23  	According to the autopsy report prepared by Dr C Lawrence, the
deceased died from blunt force injuries to the head and chest.
 The injuries to
the face comprised a fracture of the hard palate, a linear fracture of the
right frontal bone and a separation of
the facial and skull bones.  Dr Lawrence
also noted linear rib fractures in ribs three, four, five and six on the right
and in ribs
five to eleven inclusive on the left.
<P>

24  	Commenting upon Dr Lawrence's opinion, Dr Michael A Zillman, in
his report dated 12 May 1999, stated that the portion of the
skull which was
fractured was the parietal, not the frontal, bone, but I think that nothing
turns on that.  Dr Zillman thought that
a roll-over motor vehicle accident
might have caused any or all of the bony injuries and that an accelerated fall
after death could
have caused the rib fractures.  There is no evidence of any
accelerated fall after death.  I doubt whether the deceased received
any of his
injuries in the motor vehicle accident, chiefly because he twice went to the
house of the prisoner and Mrs Robson, and
no mention was made of any difficulty
he was then apparently having.  So many fractured ribs would have given him
obvious pain and
lack of mobility.  I conclude that all the bony injuries were
inflicted by the prisoner at the time the men fought in Mr Shipley's
house.
<P>

25  	Those injuries were very severe and would ordinarily imply an
intention to do grievous bodily harm.  However, the prisoner
is not to be taken
to have had so great an intent.  Perhaps the explanation is that, as he told
the police, he just "lost it", and
struck harder than he realised under the
influence of the alcohol he had drunk.
<P>

26  	Mr Strahan and Miss Holmes are to be tried in this Court,
charged respectively with the murder of the deceased and with being
an
accessory after the fact of the murder.  The prisoner was asked whether he
would give evidence for the Crown at their trial, and
he said that he would.
It is not clear from the facts that have been put before the Court on this plea
of guilty precisely how the
Crown proposes to make out its case against Mr
Strahan and Miss Holmes, but whatever that case may be, I am led to the
conclusion
that the evidence of the prisoner would be of limited worth.
<P>

27  	In the account he gave the police the prisoner said that Mr
Strahan and Miss Holmes were in the vicinity of Mr Shipley's house
after the
death of the deceased and that he, not Miss Holmes, obtained the tarpaulin in
which the deceased's body was wrapped for
disposal.  He said that he did not
know whether Mr Strahan and Miss Holmes saw him carrying the body to the car
and that he did it
all himself.  He told them that he would be back soon, drove
the car to the bush and dumped the body off a bush track.  Mr Strahan
and Miss
Holmes were not present when he did so and as far as he knew they had no idea
that he had killed the deceased.
<P>

28  	I am satisfied that this was a false story intended to protect
Mr Strahan and Miss Holmes.
<P>

29  	In evidence before me, the prisoner said that Mr Strahan entered
the house after or, perhaps, just before he stopped hitting
the deceased.
Given his obvious desire to protect Mr Strahan I am left unsure whether he is
telling the truth about this matter.
<P>

30  	I received the impression that before he was cross-examined, the
prisoner had never considered whether he would give evidence
at the forthcoming
trial.  He has made no undertaking to do so.  I think that any evidence he
might give might well be regarded by
the jury as unreliable, especially in view
of the inconsistent accounts he has given.  I shall allow only a very modest
reduction
of his sentence on this account.
<P>

31  	The prisoner is now thirty-one years old.  He has a moderate
criminal history.  I will ignore the several offences for which
he was dealt
with in the Children's Court and the Local Court earlier than ten years ago.
Since 1990 he has committed a number of
driving offences, which I will
ignore.
<P>

32  	In 1995 he was dealt with for an assault on a woman in a caravan
park.  He and another man went to the caravan of a woman at
a caravan park at
Moruya.  The prisoner sprayed the occupant with a mixture of petrol and diesel
fuel which he kept in a plastic
spray bottle.  The mixture wet the woman's
singlet.  The other man took the bottle from the prisoner, pointed it again at
the woman,
produced a cigarette lighter and lit it, then sprayed the contents
of the bottle through the flame.  The woman's hair was singed
and an ear was
slightly burnt.
<P>

33  	The prisoner was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of
four months and his colleague to eight months.  It was submitted
on his behalf
before me that the part he played in the attack was really a joke and that his
criminality was not to be seen as incorporating
what his colleague did with the
lighter.  No findings of fact were tendered from the Local Court.
<P>

34  	In view of the sentence imposed, I cannot accept that
submission.  The sentencing magistrate must have accepted that the prisoner
was
substantially responsible for all that happened to the woman, otherwise there
would have been a far greater difference between
the two sentences.
<P>

35  	A pre-sentence report was made to this Court by an officer of
the Probation and Parole Service, Mr Bajda, and he gave evidence.
 It was
pointed out by Mr Bajda that the prisoner was adopted as an infant and that his
childhood development was disrupted at age
ten years when his father died.
After that he began to display disruptive and uncooperative behaviour.  He was
often teased by his
peers because he was an adopted child.  He had difficulty
at school and was often absent.  He left without qualifications when he
was
fifteen.  He completed a pre-apprenticeship course and subsequently found work
in the timber and manufacturing industry.  He
was live-in caretaker at Moruya
Jockey Club for two years.  At the date of the report he had been unemployed
for three years.  Oral
evidence was given also of the prisoner's childhood
difficulties and their effect upon him.
<P>

36  	However, whilst such matters will often weigh heavily in the
sentencing of a youth or a young man, they can be given less weight
in the
determination of the sentence of a thirty-one year old man who has had
opportunities to overcome the difficulties he faced
as a child and as a
teenager.
<P>

37  	The prisoner pleaded guilty to manslaughter as soon as or soon
after the Crown indicated that it was prepared to accept such
a plea.  He will
have credit for that.
<P>

38  	The prisoner has a minor record for drug offences.  More
importantly, since the events of October 1997 the prisoner has become
addicted
to heroin.  He has attempted to overcome that addiction and is attending a
methadone clinic.  There appear to be good prospects
that he will rid himself
of his addiction.  The clinic reported that on 4 August 1999 the prisoner
declined to provide a urine sample,
but I accept the explanation that he has
given.
<P>

39  	The prisoner and Mrs Robson have a large family.  He has three
children by a previous relationship.  They live with their mother
but have been
visiting him every second weekend.  Mrs Robson has three children by a previous
relationship and has custody of two
of them.  The prisoner and Mrs Robson have
two further children of their own, and they live with them.  The prisoner's
mother gave
evidence, and I accept that her support and the support of Mrs
Robson is strong.
<P>

40  	I am satisfied that the prisoner profoundly regrets what he has
done and, notwithstanding my reservations about the accuracy
of his evidence, I
think that his prospects of rehabilitation are good.
<P>

41  	I think that the need for the prisoner to rid himself of his
heroin addiction and to complete his rehabilitation and bear the
responsibilities that he will have towards his family once again upon his
release call for the imposition of an additional term which
is greater than
one-third of the minimum term of the sentence I intend to impose.
<P>

42  	Although they lacked frequent contact with the deceased because
of his movements and because he spent periods of time in prison,
his sister and
brother, Ms Mariea Whitby and Mr Malcolm Brotherton, loved him.  Victim impact
statements have been put before the
Court which say something of the effect the
death of the deceased has had upon them.  Of course, the effect of the death of
the deceased
on his family cannot be taken into account in fixing the sentence
to be imposed on the prisoner, but it is appropriate for the Court
to extend
its sympathy to the family, and it does so.
<P>

43  	The prisoner is sentenced to penal servitude for a period of
five years, comprising a minimum term of three years commencing
on 20 August
1999 and expiring on 19 August 2002 and an additional term of two years.  The
prisoner will be eligible for release
on parole on 19 August 2002.
