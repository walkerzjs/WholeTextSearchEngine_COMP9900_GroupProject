<b>FILE NO. - 20152/98 - White v Malco Engineering Pty Limited</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  In these proceedings the plaintiff, Bruce Charles
White, sued the first defendant Malco Engineering Pty Limited
("Malco") and the
second defendant Skilled Engineering Pty Limited ("Skilled") for damages for
personal injuries allegedly suffered
in an accident occurring on Saturday 4
November 1995 at the premises of Australian Newsprint Mills ("ANM") at Albury.
At the time
of the accident the plaintiff was employed by Skilled but was
working in the operations of Malco, to whom Skilled had hired his labour.
 The
plaintiff was working at the premises of ANM with two employees of Malco, named
Peter Dyson ("Mr Dyson") and Leslie Onody ("Mr
Onody").  When he was injured
the plaintiff was engaged in attempting to jump start an item of equipment,
which was variously referred
to in the evidence as an elevated work platform, a
boom lift or a cherry picker and which, for the sake of convenience, I will
refer
to as "the boom lift", by using the battery of a Manitou forklift ("the
forklift"), which had been positioned alongside the boom
lift.  During this
operation the forklift started moving forwards, trapped the plaintiff's right
foot thereby throwing him to the
ground and then ran over part of the
plaintiff's right leg, injuring the leg.
<P>

2  	The plaintiff's case against Malco, succinctly stated, was that
Malco owed the plaintiff duties analogous to those owed by an
employer to an
employee and had failed to take reasonable care to provide safe plant and
equipment and a safe system of work (in
particular, it was alleged that the
forklift was defective) and that by reason of these breaches of duty the
plaintiff had been injured,
or, alternatively, Malco was vicariously liable for
casual acts of negligence by its employee Mr Onody, by reason of which the
plaintiff
had been injured.  The plaintiff's case against Skilled, succinctly
stated, was that Skilled, as the actual employer of the plaintiff,
was subject
to the duties of an employer, which were non-delegable, that Skilled itself had
failed to discharge those duties and
Skilled was liable for failures by Malco
to take reasonable care to provide safe plant and equipment and a safe system
of work.
<P>

3  	No fewer than nine cross-claims were brought in the proceedings
and these cross-claims had the effect of considerably prolonging
the hearing.
Many of these cross-claims were based on the allegedly defective condition of
the forklift or on an alleged statutory
liability of a cross-defendant as being
the "owner" of the forklift.  In order to understand the cross-claims, it is
necessary first
to record a number of facts about the forklift, none of which
were in dispute at the hearing.
<P>

4  	Between 13 May 1993 and 31 January 1996 the forklift was
registered as a motor vehicle in the State of Victoria pursuant to
Victorian
legislation, the registered owner being "Caddy's Timber &amp; Hardware".  It
was common ground at the hearing that between
those dates the registered owner
of the forklift was in fact a company Syd-Fam Pty Limited ("Syd-Fam"), which
carried on business
at Yarrawonga in the State of Victoria under the name of
Caddy's Timber &amp; Building Supplies.  The forklift had been acquired
by
Syd-Fam through a company Lift Truck Services Pty Limited ("Lift Truck
Services"), which carried on in Albury the business of
selling and servicing
forklifts.  An associated company Liftqip Pty Limited ("Liftqip") carried on
the business of hiring out forklifts,
using the same premises as Lift Truck
Services.  Forklifts hired out by Liftqip were serviced and maintained by Lift
Truck Services.
 During the period that Syd-Fam owned the forklift, the
forklift was serviced on a number of occasions by Lift Truck Services.
<P>

5  	In August 1995 the forklift was brought back to the premises of
Lift Truck Services in Albury, where it remained until 31 October.
<P>

6  	In late October 1995 Malco required a forklift for use in
carrying out the work it was performing at the ANM Mill in Albury.
 Mr Moore, a
supply manager employed by Malco, telephoned Mr Hudson of "Wreckair", a company
carrying on business in Wodonga in Victoria
and arranged for the hire of a
forklift by Wreckair to Malco.  The company formerly trading as "Wreckair" is
now named Prevwreck
Pty Limited and it will be convenient to refer to it as
"Prevwreck".
<P>

7  	A purchase order dated 26 October 1995 was sent from Malco to
Prevwreck for the hire of a five tonne forklift "on site Australian
Newsprint
Mills... from midday Monday 30/10/95".
<P>

8  	Prevwreck did not have a forklift of the size ordered by Malco in
its depot and Prevwreck arranged for a forklift to be hired
from Liftqip.
<P>

9  	On 31 October 1995 an employee of Prevwreck, Jason Harders,
picked up the forklift from the premises of Lift Truck Services
at Laverton and
delivered the forklift to the premises of ANM. 
<P>

10  	The hire of the forklift by Malco continued to 9 November 1995.
On 9 November 1995 Prevwreck gave Malco a "returned from hire"
document.
Liftqip sent an invoice to Prevwreck for the rental for the hire of the
forklift and associated charges and Prevwreck sent
an invoice to Malco for the
rental for the hire of the forklift and associated charges.  Prevwreck charged
Malco a higher rate of
rental than Liftqip charged Prevwreck.
<P>

11  	As I have already indicated, no fewer than nine cross-claims
were brought in the proceedings. Some of these cross-claims were
brought
against more than one cross-defendant and contained more than one cause of
action.   I will now list the cross-claims, not
in accordance with their
nominal order, but in what I consider to be a more functional and
comprehensible order.
<P>

12  	1.	Cross-claim by Malco against Skilled (which was nominally the
third cross-claim).
<P>

13  	2.	Cross-claim by Skilled against Malco (part of the fifth
cross-claim).
<P>

14  	3.	Cross-claim by Malco against Prevwreck (the seventh
cross-claim).
<P>

15  	4.	Cross-claim by Malco against Liftqip (the sixth
cross-claim).
<P>

16  	5.	Cross-claim by Malco against Lift Truck Services (the first
cross-claim).
<P>

17  	6.	Cross-claim by Skilled against Lift Truck Services and
Liftqip (part of the fifth cross-claim).
<P>

18  	7.	Cross-claim by Malco against Syd-Fam (the second
cross-claim).
<P>

19  	8.	Cross claim by Skilled against Syd-Fam (part of the fifth
cross-claim).
<P>

20  	9.	Cross-claim by Prevwreck against Lift Truck Services and
Liftqip (the eighth cross-claim).
<P>

21  	10.	Cross-claim by Syd-Fam against Skilled (the fourth
cross-claim).
<P>

22  	11.	Cross-claim by Syd-Fam against each of Lift Truck Services,
Liftqip and Prevwreck (the ninth cross-claim)
<P>

23  	No cross-claim was brought by either Lift Truck Services or
Liftqip against anyone.
<P>

24  	It became apparent during the course of the hearing that it
would be impracticable for me to attempt to prepare a single judgment
in which
I dealt definitively with all of the many issues which have arisen in these
proceedings and it was accepted by the parties
that I would first deliver a
preliminary judgment in which I dealt with some only of the issues.  The
present judgment is such a
preliminary judgment.
<P>

<b>The Evidence</b>
<P>

25  	The evidence at the hearing was extensive.  I will now summarise
some of the more salient parts of the evidence of each witness.
 I have taken
into account all of the evidence, oral and documentary, whether or not it is
included in my summary.
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff</b>
<P>

<b>Evidence in Chief</b>
<P>

26  	The plaintiff was born on 21 August 1957.  He left school at the
age of seventeen.  He married in 1981, the marriage is still
subsisting and
there have been two children of the marriage, who at the time when the
plaintiff gave his evidence in chief in November
1998 were aged seventeen and
fifteen.
<P>

27  	The plaintiff had obtained a rigger's ticket and various tickets
as a crane driver.  I accept that he qualified for a forklift
ticket, although
inadvertently the actual documentary ticket was not sent to him.  At the time
of the accident the plaintiff had
been driving forklifts for approximately ten
years.
<P>

28  	Between 1988 and 1990 the plaintiff carried on his own business,
contracting to do any work he was qualified to perform.
<P>

29  	The plaintiff said that he had not been working full-time
between 1990 and the time of the accident.  He gave the following
further
evidence:-
<P>

"Q.	What were you doing?
<P>

A.	I was applying for work when I needed money, and mainly spending most of the
my time with my children and my wife.
<P>

<center>* * *</center>
<P>


<P>

Q.	What were you averaging as to the number of days a week you were working?
<P>

A.	Well, I would average about four days a week, but not consecutive.  I may
work three weeks straight seven days a week and then
I will take a month and a
half off and not even worry about applying for a job.
<P>

Q.	Did you intend to continue doing that forever?  Was that the programme you
were going to follow?
<P>

A.	No, up until my children became of age where they were getting on with their
own life.  I was then going to concentrate on going
back to the big dollars in
the major cities.
<P>

Q.	What, full-time work?
<P>

A.	No, as in similar thing, coming up to Sydney, work for three months then
quit the job and go home, just get enough money to last
for a few more months
then go back, but I would have been putting a lot more emphasis in earning a
lot more money to go towards my
retirement as in I hadn't really worried about
it beforehand".
<P>

30  	The plaintiff gave some evidence about the kind of life he had
been leading before the accident.  He had been a member of a
motor bike club
and had engaged in many active out-door activities.  He had spent a lot of time
with his children.  He and his wife
had had a close relationship and had gone
touring together.  
<P>

31  	The plaintiff had previously worked for Skilled on a few
occasions.  On the present occasion:-
<P>

"Malco rung me direct and wanted to put me through a hire company and they
didn't care which one, and I told them Man Power, Skilled
Engineering".
<P>

32  	The plaintiff began working at the ANM Mill on 30 or 31 October
1995.  He worked as part of a gang or crew with Mr Dyson and
Mr Onody, who, as
I have previously said, were employees of Malco.  Both Mr Dyson and Mr Onody,
but particularly Mr Dyson, gave him
instructions on what he had to do.  The
plaintiff was paid for his work by Skilled.
<P>

33  	On Saturday 4 November 1995 the plaintiff, Mr Dyson and Mr Onody
were engaged in bolting parts of an overhead steel gantry
together.  The
plaintiff was instructed by Mr Dyson to climb a ladder.  The plaintiff refused
to use the ladder because it was bent
and dangerous.  He was then instructed by
Mr Dyson to find some kind of substitute for the ladder.  The plaintiff found
the boom
lift, which had the keys in the ignition.  It was common practice on
the site to use whatever equipment was available.  The plaintiff
brought the
boom lift to a place where the three men were working.  Mr Dyson then used the
boom lift to fix bolts in the gantry.
<P>

34  	When the plaintiff, Mr Dyson and Mr Onody were getting ready to
stop work for the day, it was discovered that the boom lift
could not be
restarted. It was necessary to restart the boom lift, because the boom could
not be left sticking up in the air.  The
battery of the boom lift had gone
flat.  The three men had "a bit of a conference to.. get another machine to try
and start the boom
lift".  The plaintiff got the forklift, which he had used
previously at the Mill and brought it over to the boom lift.
<P>

35  	The plaintiff had been present, when the forklift had been
delivered to the Mill.  The person delivering the forklift (Jason
Harders) told
the plaintiff "that it was very hard to find neutral in the forklift... , so to
be careful".  However, the plaintiff
said in his evidence:-
<P>

"I hadn't found any difficulty with finding neutral, mainly because when I
turned the machine off I always made sure it wasn't moving
and pulled the kill
switch, so it had to be in neutral".
<P>

36  	The plaintiff had driven the forklift for two to three hours a
day each day since 30 or 31 October, except for the last two
days before the
accident.  He considered that the forklift was inadequate, out of date and "a
terrible forklift".  The handbrake
was unsatisfactory.  "There was no way it
was going to hold the forklift if it was on a hill or anything.  Also the
markings on all
the levers were being used for so many years... virtually
impossible to see".
<P>

37  	An abortive attempt was made to tow the boom lift, using the
forklift and a sling.  It was then decided to try and jump start
the boom lift
using the forklift.  The plaintiff continued:-
<P>

"I moved it parallel to the forklift,(the plaintiff obviously meant the boom
lift) getting the wheels reasonably close together.
 I put the tongs down to
the ground, pulled the hand brake on, made sure it was out of gear because I
was jump starting a vehicle,
turned the machine off with the kill pull.  I
hopped out, down to hook the batteries up.  Les passed me some welding leads
which
are high - then we used some clamps to connect the batteries up and Les
started the forklift up".
<P>

38  	Mr Onody started the forklift, because he was asked to do so by
the plaintiff.  One of the clamps the plaintiff was using on
the forklift
battery was unsatisfactory.  Mr Onody went to his tool box, which was some
distance away from the forklift, to get another
clamp.  The plaintiff
continued:-
<P>

"Within about 20 to 30 seconds, I noticed the forklift actually started moving;
because I had my hands on the forklift before it
started moving, where the
batteries were".
<P>

<center>* * *</center>
<P>


<P>

"It caught my right foot, which threw me down on the ground.  I tried to pull
my boot out of my foot which didn't work.  It crawled
up my leg at a slow pace.
I screamed out.  Les run over and jumped in the forklift.  He was trying to
stop the forklift and was unable
to.  He was pulling levers.  He turned or
someone turned the wheel, which then pinned me up against the wheel of the boom
lift because
when I threw myself down I spun myself around, so it would only
run over my leg but when the wheel got turned it actually crawled
further up
onto my hip, pinned my chest and my back on the wheel of the other and at that
point I thought I was going to die and
then all of a sudden the wheels turned
back the other way and it run over my left hand because I was actually pushing
myself away,
trying to get away from the wheel at the time.  Then the forklift
kept going and jammed up against the conveyer that we had just
put in earlier,
resting at that spot there".
<P>

39  	The plaintiff did not lose consciousness in the accident.  After
the accident he was taken immediately to the Albury Base Hospital
and his right
leg was placed in traction.  Surgery was performed to fix fractures he had
sustained in his right leg.  His right leg
was grossly swollen for some
time.
<P>

40  	The plaintiff was discharged from hospital on about 27 November
1995.  When he returned home, he was mobile only on crutches.
 For a month or
so he was looked after by his wife and children, who washed him, cooked for him
and put his trousers on.  The plaintiff
gradually became more capable of
looking after himself.  He was troubled by clicking in his right knee.  He had
difficulty in walking
over rough ground or up and down stairs.  The plaintiff
continued:-
<P>

"I have improved immensely as in I can climb up steps and I can walk across
rough ground, it is just the pain that I suffer if I
do a great deal of it,
after".
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

"In the hip area mainly, and the lower back if I do, if I seem to do any
long-distance walking".
<P>

41  	The plaintiff dislikes taking medication but does take pills
which assist him to sleep.
<P>

42  	The plaintiff considered that the condition of his back and leg
was fairly stable, although whether he has to walk with a limp
varies
dramatically, depending on what activity he has engaged in and whether the
plaintiff has been travelling.
<P>

43  	After the accident the plaintiff took part in a rehabilitation
programme lasting about three months.  He subsequently obtained
a position as a
sales person in a local Harley Davidson shop run by CJ's Big Twin Pty Limited.
Between January and April 1997 he
attended three days a week "training".  After
Easter 1997 (from 17 April 1997) and until April 1998 he worked five days a
week as
a sales person, earning $284 a week net.  He had coped quite well with
training three days a week.  However, working five days a
week he was in a lot
of pain with his hip, lower back and knee.  In April 1998 the plaintiff started
working for three days a week
only.
<P>

44  	An incident occurred at the plaintiff's place of work, when a
customer of the business assaulted the plaintiff.    After the
assault the
plaintiff decided not to go back to work at the Harley Davidson shop.  The
plaintiff has not worked since.  The plaintiff
said:-
<P>

"Up to date I have looked in the paper, but I've actually contacted no one for
other work because it's hard to get somebody to employ
you three days a week.
There has been nothing advertised".
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

"I would work nowadays if I could work for myself, really.  I don't want to
work for another employer, be put in the hands of somebody
else any more".
<P>

45  	The plaintiff said that he would not be able to do a rigger's
work or manual work "because I couldn't do heavy lifting".  He
would like to be
self-employed "when my wife and I could run a small business, where I only have
to do three days per week".
<P>

46  	Before the accident the plaintiff did all of the handyman work
around the house, the lawns and some of the gardening.  After
the accident a
back room of the plaintiff's house had been rebuilt but the plaintiff son had
done ninety per cent of the work because
the plaintiff experienced pain after
climbing, lifting and bending.  Since the accident the plaintiff has done only
about ten per
cent of the handyman work around the house.  The plaintiff said
that his son did the general maintenance around the house.  He said:-
<P>

"He would spend two hours a day.  He mainly does it on Mondays and Tuesdays
because he goes to TAFE three days a week, so it would
be a good 16 hours a
week he would spend.
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

"Everything from cleaning the shed out, maintenance on the lawn mowers, because
I have got two lawn mowers, general tidying up,
going through my market stuff
that I have got left and a lot of different things".
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

"He also does the lawns".
<P>

47  	Since the accident the plaintiff has had the house painted and
the patio and driveway of the house concreted, jobs he would
have done himself
if he had not been injured.
<P>

48  	The plaintiff told the rehabilitation expert Mrs Ravagnani what
is now being done for him by members of his family.  Since
the accident the
plaintiff has been unable to go bushwalking or engage in other out door
activities and he resigned from the motor
bike club because he was unable to
participate fully.  
<P>

<b>Cross-examination</b>
<P>

49  	The plaintiff was cross-examined at length by counsel for Malco.

<P>

50  	The plaintiff said that the forklift had two gear levers, a main
gear lever and a forward-reverse lever, which the plaintiff
said had neutral
and also low ("I'm 90 per cent sure").
<P>

51  	The plaintiff said that in parking the forklift alongside the
boom lift:-
<P>

"I put the lever between my legs, which is the gear shift, in neutral.  I
lowered the tongs on the ground, pulled the handbrake
lever on and the other
lever which is on the left-hand side (the forward-reverse lever) into
neutral".
<P>

52  	The plaintiff had driven the forklift about fifty feet to the
boom lift and had then reversed the forklift, until it was alongside
the back
of the boom lift.  The abortive attempt to tow the boom lift by using the
forklift had then been made by means of a sling
from the forklift to the boom
lift.  The plaintiff then relocated the forklift alongside the boom lift.  The
plaintiff was ninety
per cent sure, although he could not remember precisely,
that in this manoeuvre he had first moved forward in first gear and had
then
reversed the forklift.  
<P>

53  	The plaintiff accepted that the forklift would have been in
gear, when it was moving forward and trapped his foot and then
his leg.  The
forklift was moving very slowly and that was consistent with the forklift being
in a low forward gear.  For the forklift
to move forward (if it was in proper
working condition), the main gear lever would have had to have been in gear and
the forward-reverse
lever in the forward position.  If the handbrake had been
applied and had been operating properly, the handbrake should have stopped
the
forklift from moving, even if the main gear lever had been in gear and the
forward-reverse lever had been in forward.
<P>

54  	When the plaintiff had driven the forklift at the Mill before he
had been injured, he had not had any problem with the forklift
moving, when it
should not have.
<P>

55  	The plaintiff said that he had pulled the handbrake "all the way
back.. when I used to pull it, I used to pull it as far back
as it could
possibly go".
<P>

56  	The plaintiff was shown photographs of the forklift, in which he
identified the main gear lever, the forward-reverse lever
and the handbrake.

<P>

57  	The leads which had been used in trying to jump start the boom
lift were welding leads, approximately twenty feet long.
<P>

58  	The plaintiff gave evidence that no one from Skilled had shown
him any manual for forklift driving and no one from Skilled
had told him that
the forklift should not be started unless someone remained at the controls and
that no one from Skilled had told
him that one should not stand near the wheels
of a forklift while its engine was running.  He also said that no one from
Skilled
had told him to report to Skilled, if he had any safety problem with
any of the equipment he was provided with.
<P>

59  	The plaintiff was asked about the making of the decision to
attempt to jump start the boom lift.  He said it was "a group decision"...
I
don't know whose idea it was to use the forklift".
<P>

60  	The plaintiff asked Mr Onody to start the engine of the
forklift, because the plaintiff was engaged in applying the leads to
the
battery of the forklift and it was necessary to have the motor of the forklift
running, in order to jump start the boom lift.
<P>

61  	The plaintiff could not recall how Mr Onody started the
forklift.  At one point Mr Onody was standing on the running board
or foot
plate near the cabin of the forklift.  From that position, Mr Onody would have
had to have leant into the cabin of the forklift
in order to start the
forklift.  After the engine of the forklift had started, Mr Onody left to get a
better clamp from his tool
box, because the clamp the plaintiff had was
unsatisfactory and it was not possible for the plaintiff simply to hold the end
of the
lead with his hand on to the terminal of the battery of the forklift.
<P>

62  	After Mr Onody left to get the clamp, the plaintiff did not turn
off the engine of the forklift, because he was holding the
welding lead and the
clamp.  He agreed that he could have let go of what he was holding and turned
the engine off and that that would
have been a safer course to adopt, than
remaining where he was with the engine of the forklift running and no one at
the controls
of the forklift.
<P>

63  	The plaintiff estimated that twenty to thirty seconds elapsed
after the engine of the forklift was started before the forklift
started to
move but he could not be precise about the length of time which elapsed.  He
denied that it could have been as short as
ten seconds.
<P>

64  	With regard to his evidence that he had been told by the person
who had delivered the forklift to the Mill that it was hard
to get the forklift
into neutral, the plaintiff agreed that that could have meant that either the
main gear lever or the forward-reverse
lever was hard to get into neutral.
<P>

65  	The plaintiff gave further evidence about his practice in
stopping the forklift.  He said:-
<P>

"I always, the way I shut the machine down I had never any trouble with the
forward and reverse.  The trouble I found with the forklift
is the floor shift,
because it had so much slop you felt if it was in gear it was in neutral and if
it was in neutral it felt like
it was in gear.  So I depress the clutch, pull
it back one click, take my foot off the clutch, then I would put the other
lever into
neutral and that was the way I parked the machine with the tongs on
the ground, and I had the forklift sitting over night, went back,
hopped in it,
started up and never had a problem with it".
<P>

66  	The plaintiff said:-
<P>

"The four speed gear lever had a lot of slack and no markings on, where it was
supposed to be sitting".
<P>

67  	It was necessary to use the clutch in order to use the main gear
lever but it was not necessary to use the clutch in order
to use the
forward-reverse lever.
<P>

68  	The forklift was started simply by turning the ignition key.
<P>

69  	The plaintiff had had no experience of the forklift taking some
time to start moving, after the engine had been started and
the forklift was in
gear.  If, when the forklift was started, the forward-reverse lever was in
neutral, then, even if the main gear
lever was in gear, the forklift should not
move.
<P>

70  	When it was put to the plaintiff that he might have left the
forklift in gear, without knowing it, he replied:-
<P>

"No, because I released the hydraulic switch, the hydraulic forward-reverse
switch last and my foot was already off the clutch.
 I made that a practice to
make sure it was in neutral.  So if it was in gear, as soon as I took my foot
off the clutch it should
have moved forward".
<P>

71  	At the time of the accident the plaintiff had no idea whether Mr
Onody had any knowledge of how forklifts operated.  The plaintiff
simply told
Mr Onody to turn the forklift on.  The plaintiff did not tell Mr Onody to get
into the driver's seat of the forklift
or to stay near the forklift after he
had started it.  
<P>

72  	The plaintiff was cross-examined about complaints he said he had
made about the forklift to Mr Dyson.  The plaintiff said he
had complained to
Mr Dyson about the age of the forklift and that the handbrake did not work and
that he had repeated to Mr Dyson
what the person delivering the forklift to the
Mill had said about the gears.
<P>

73  	The plaintiff agreed that, even if the engine of the forklift
was on and the forklift was in gear, activating the kill switch
would
immediately bring the forklift to a halt.
<P>

74  	At the time he gave evidence in November 1998 the plaintiff was
still employed by the motor cycle shop, although he had not
actually worked in
the shop since about September 1998, when he had been assaulted.  The employer
at the motor cycle shop had been
"very negotiable" on how much time the
plaintiff spent walking around and how much time he spent sitting down.  The
job at the motor
cycle shop had been "created" for the plaintiff.  The main
thing he did was to answer the telephone.  The plaintiff was not a very
good
reader and "a lot of people take my manner as being rude and abrupt, which
doesn't make very good telephone skills".
<P>

75  	The plaintiff was asked about his work habits before the
accident.  He agreed that he and his wife had developed a philosophy
of not
being "slaves to work", that they were going to leave room in their lives for
more creative and fulfilling activities than
work.  He had tried to work six
months out of the year and have six months off.  However, he claimed that, if
the accident had not
happened, this pattern would have continued only "until
the kids were old enough".
<P>

76  	The plaintiff was cross-examined by counsel for Skilled.  
<P>

77  	He gave further evidence about the telephone call he had
received from Malco.  He said:-
<P>

"They said that they wanted me to continue on with the job because I was
familiar, and that they wanted me to continue on with the
job because I was
familiar working with the crew, and that I'd have to go through a body hire
company and they didn't really care
which one it was".
<P>

78  	The plaintiff agreed that plant and equipment at the site had
been provided by Malco and that Malco employees controlled what
the plaintiff
did and when he did it.
<P>

79  	The plaintiff could not remember the truck driver who had
delivered the forklift to the ANM Mill.  The plaintiff had walked
over to the
truck driver to take delivery of the forklift.  The truck driver had not given
any demonstration of the forklift.  
<P>

80  	The plaintiff had not known anything about the qualifications,
or rather lack of qualifications, of Mr Dyson and Mr Onody in
relation to
forklifts.  
<P>

81  	The plaintiff would be able to work at a bench, if he could
stand or sit, on his own terms, and also walk around from time
to time.  
<P>

82  	The plaintiff said that because of the assault he was receiving
weekly payments of workers' compensation.  
<P>

83  	The plaintiff was cross-examined by counsel for Syd-Fam. 
<P>

84  	The plaintiff said that his recollection was that he had used
the forklift on two days, other than the day on which the accident
happened.
<P>

85  	The plaintiff could not recall who from Malco had telephoned
him.  He had been told in the telephone conversation that he would
be doing
labouring and rigging work, general helping out and operating a forklift and
other machinery.
<P>

86  	The plaintiff had previously in 1995 worked with Malco at the
ANM Mill, "going through Skilled".  On that occasion it had been
Skilled, and
not Malco, who had contacted him.
<P>

87  	The plaintiff had gone to Skilled's office in Wodonga "seven
years ago", filled out an application form and produced the trade
tickets he
then held.  All his subsequent contacts with Skilled had been by telephone.  A
few days before the plaintiff attended
at the Mill in October 1995 he had had a
telephone conversation with an officer or employee of Skilled, in which he had
said that
he had a certificate to operate forklifts.  The plaintiff did not
discover that the document which had been sent to him after he
took the test
for his forklift ticket was not a forklift ticket, until some time after the
accident had happened.
<P>

88  	The plaintiff knew that Mr Dyson was a fitter and that Mr Onody
was a boilermaker-welder.  He had not seen either of them operate
any of the
equipment at the Mill, except that Mr Dyson had operated the boom lift.  Mr
Dyson was the nominated leading hand of Malco.
 Each morning the plaintiff
reported to Mr Dyson.  The duties the plaintiff performed on the site were
allocated to him by Mr Dyson.
 The plaintiff was not given any directions about
how to operate any of the machinery.  Apart from Mr Onody some times asking the
plaintiff to bring something over to him, Mr Dyson "had the last say in every
other matter".
<P>

89  	The plaintiff gave evidence about the task which he, Mr Dyson
and Mr Onody were performing on 4 November.  They were erecting
several steel
columns and overhead beams (that is an overhead gantry frame), which had been
prefabricated by Malco.  On the afternoon
of 4 November 1995 the task was to
affix bolts to the frame.  The bolts were to be affixed about twelve to
thirteen feet above floor
level.  The ladder which Mr Dyson had asked the
plaintiff to use and which the plaintiff had refused to use, was a ladder
belonging
to Malco, which had been obtained from a container in which Malco's
tools and equipment were kept.
<P>

90  	After the plaintiff had refused to use the ladder, Mr Dyson had
asked the plaintiff to find something else with which to continue
the job.  The
plaintiff went looking and found the boom lift.  After the plaintiff had
brought the boom lift across Mr Dyson operated
the boom lift for about five
hours, fixing the bolts.  
<P>

91  	The plaintiff gave further evidence about how the accident had
happened.  The plaintiff was standing on the left-hand side
of the forklift (if
one faces in the same direction as the forklift was facing) in between the
forklift and the boom lift.  The plaintiff
was standing with the boom lift
behind him.  The battery of the forklift, near where the plaintiff was, was
positioned between the
front and back wheels of the forklift.  It was possible
actually to see the battery.  Mr Onody was on the plaintiff's left, on the
same
side of the forklift as the plaintiff.  When the plaintiff asked Mr Onody to
start the forklift "I was a 100 per cent sure that
it (the forklift) wasn't
going to move".  The lead on the plaintiff's right was sparking, so that it was
not making a good connection.
 The plaintiff could not recall whether he asked
Mr Onody to get another clamp or whether Mr Onody volunteered to get a clamp.
The
welding leads which were used had been provided by Malco.  The plaintiff
agreed that "the only activity you can remember performing
between when you
asked Mr Onody to turn on the ignition and when the wheel ran over your foot
was seeking to put one of the leads
on to the right hand battery terminal and
watching it spark and "the next thing you knew, it (the forklift) was running
over your
foot".  If the plaintiff had not had the difficulty putting the clamp
on the right hand battery terminal, he would more than likely
have turned on
the forklift himself.
<P>

92  	The plaintiff was cross-examined by counsel for Prevwreck.
<P>

93  	The plaintiff said that if the forklift was started with the
main gear lever in neutral, it was necessary to depress the clutch
in order to
operate the main gear lever so as to put it in gear and thus enable the
forklift to move forward.
<P>

94  	The plaintiff said that he did not detect any forward movement
of the forklift, before the rear wheel of the forklift was on
his right foot.

<P>

95  	The plaintiff did not detect any change in the sound of the
motor of the forklift, after Mr Onody started it.  He said "where
we were
working is a very loud area.  There's a big machine running".  
<P>

96  	The plaintiff could not recall whether Mr Onody was sitting down
or standing up, before he left the forklift to get a clamp.
<P>

97  	The plaintiff did not ask Mr Onody to check that the forklift
was in neutral before he started it, because "I knew that it
was in
neutral".
<P>

98  	It was not possible to check whether the main gear lever was in
neutral, simply by looking at the position of the gear lever.
 It was necessary
to depress the clutch.
<P>

99  	The plaintiff was cross-examined by counsel for Lift Truck
Services and Liftqip.
<P>

100  	The plaintiff said that the two vehicles, the boom lift and the
forklift, were positioned very close together for the attempted
jump starting.
It was not possible to walk between the wheels of the two vehicles.  The
plaintiff did not see the leads, until they
were handed to him.  However, as
the leads were so long, it would not have been necessary to have the boom lift
and the forklift
so close together.  
<P>

101  	After positioning the forklift for the attempted jump starting,
the plaintiff climbed down from the forklift to in between
the two vehicles.
He agreed that he was in a dangerous position, if either of the vehicles moved.
He did not go there as a result
of any instruction from Mr Dyson but he had to
go there in order to do the job.  The plaintiff first applied the leads to the
battery
of the boom lift.  He then sought to apply the leads to the battery of
the forklift.  One lead would not stay put on the terminal
to the plaintiff's
right and the plaintiff had to hold the clamp in position with his hand.
<P>

102  	The plaintiff conceded that he did not really have any idea of
where Mr Onody was.  Although the plaintiff had previously
said in his evidence
that Mr Onody was on the same side of the forklift as the plaintiff, he said:
"I honestly can't remember him
actually being in the same area as me.  He could
have actually walked around and hopped in the other side (of the forklift)".
The
plaintiff did not take any notice of how Mr Onody started the forklift.
<P>

103  	The plaintiff had marked the position of the battery of the
forklift on a photograph of the forklift, as being in a position,
not on the
foot plate, but some distance above the foot plate, where it would have been
necessary to lift a side panel of the forklift
in order to get at the battery.
However, the plaintiff thought that the battery had been in an open position on
the forklift and
he could not recall lifting a panel.  If the battery of the
forklift had been in the position indicated by the plaintiff, then the
plaintiff would have been standing close to the front wheel of the forklift.

<P>

104  	The plaintiff accepted that if Mr Onody had been able to see
what the plaintiff was doing, Mr Onody would have had to have
been in one of a
certain limited number of positions on or near the forklift. If Mr Onody had
been standing outside the forklift
on the same side of the forklift as the
plaintiff and between the front and rear wheels of the forklift, he would have
been very
close to the plaintiff.
<P>

105  	The plaintiff repeated that, although he had had his right hand
on the lead he was holding against the terminal of the battery
of the forklift,
he did not feel anything move, until his right foot was trapped by the forklift
wheel.
<P>

106  	The plaintiff confirmed that he had lowered the tines of the
forklift on to the floor, so that when the forklift moved it
had to drag (or
push) a section of the tines across the floor of the Mill.  Accordingly, if the
forklift had moved, as the plaintiff
said it had, it had to move against the
brake which the plaintiff had applied and against the friction of the tines on
the floor.
<P>

107  	The plaintiff had done the tests for his forklift ticket
somewhere between four and twelve months before the accident.  Skilled
had not
asked the plaintiff to produce a forklift driver's ticket.
<P>

<b>Re-examination</b>
<P>

108  	In re-examination the plaintiff said that the noise of a nearby
machine would have drowned out the noise of the forklift's
engine and the noise
of anything dragging on the floor.
<P>

109  	The plaintiff marked the position of the ignition switch on a
photograph of part of the cabin of the forklift, as being on
the right hand
side of the dashboard underneath the steering wheel.  If a person was standing
on the foot plate of the forklift on
the left-hand side of the cabin, it would
be necessary to lean two and a half to three feet across the cabin, in order to
turn the
key in the ignition.
<P>

110  	The plaintiff confirmed that "if you hit... the kill switch...
the engine shuts down, everything shuts down".  The plaintiff
said that the
procedure he had always followed in stopping the forklift was to put the main
gear lever in neutral, take his foot
off the clutch, put the forward-reverse
lever in neutral, pull the kill switch, apply the handbrake and then lower the
tines to the
ground.
<P>

<b>Evidence in Reply</b>
<P>

111  	In evidence in reply the plaintiff said that the effects of the
assault on him had finished (he was giving evidence in June
1999) and the
disabilities he now had were attributable to the original accident in November
1995 and not in any way to the assault.
<P>

112  	The plaintiff said that he was looking for work of the same
nature as the work he had done at the motor cycle shop.  He was
capable of
doing such work but he would not be able to go back to the motor cycle shop
itself.
<P>

<b>Further cross-examination </b>
<P>

113  	The plaintiff was recalled for further cross-examination by
counsel for Prevwreck, after Mr Harders had given evidence in
Prevwreck's
case.
<P>

114  	The plaintiff agreed that he had spoken to the person who had
delivered the forklift to the Mill.  He said that no other person
had been with
him when he spoke to the deliverer.  He denied that the deliverer had
demonstrated the safe operation of the forklift
to the plaintiff or to Mr
Dyson.  All the deliverer had said about the forklift was what the plaintiff
had previously said in his
evidence.  After the forklift had been delivered,
the plaintiff drove the forklift away.  The forklift was similar to other
forklifts
the plaintiff had driven previously.
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff's Wife</b>
<P>

<b>Evidence in Chief</b>
<P>

115  	The plaintiff's wife gave evidence that before the accident the
plaintiff had done all the maintenance work and handyman work
around the house.
The plaintiff had ridden his motor cycle and had engaged in other outdoor
activities, in which she had also participated.
 The plaintiff and she had had
a lifestyle in which the plaintiff worked, effectively, part-time.  She
said:-
<P>

"When the kids left home, we were hoping to chase the work and do a bit of work
and earn a bit of money and try and get a nest egg".
<P>

116  	The plaintiff's wife asserted that while the plaintiff was in
hospital she visited him and tended to him.  In response to
a leading question
from the plaintiff's senior counsel ("so what are we talking about, six or
eight hours a day, that sort of thing?"
 She replied "yes".  
<P>

117  	Mrs White confirmed that after the plaintiff was discharged
from hospital, he needed help with putting some of his clothes
on, his meals
and the making of coffee for him.  In response to a question whether the
plaintiff was able to shower himself, she
replied "yes".
<P>

118  	Mrs White said that the plaintiff was upset and depressed.  Mrs
White said that ever since the accident happened the plaintiff
had been taking
Panadol just about every day, costing $15-$20 per week.
<P>

119  	The plaintiff was on crutches for a couple of months after he
returned home from hospital.  
<P>

120  	The plaintiff had not resumed doing handyman tasks.  The
plaintiff's son did a lot of the maintenance on the house and the
family car.

<P>

121  	When the plaintiff was working five days a week in the motor
cycle shop "he was very moody, very cranky and in a lot of pain
from the
travelling".  
<P>

122  	The plaintiff's wife said that the plaintiff was now very
restless at night and she complained about his snoring.  Their married
life had
not been as happy since the accident, as it had been before.  
<P>

123  	The plaintiff's wife considered that the plaintiff's condition
had been about the same since the accident happened.
<P>

<b>Cross-examination</b>
<P>

124  	In cross-examination the plaintiff's wife said that their son
took after his father in having a liking for practical manual
work.
<P>

125  	Since 1988 the plaintiff and his wife had been living at
Culcairn, a very small town about three quarters of an hour to an
hour's drive
north of Albury.
<P>

126  	For a period of a couple of months the plaintiff had stayed a
couple of nights a week at a motor cycle clubhouse, looking
after himself.
<P>

<b>Experts' Reports</b>
<P>

127  	There was admitted into evidence as part of the plaintiff's
case a report of a preliminary investigation into the accident
prepared by an
accident investigation team from ANM.  It was common ground that many parts of
the report, as a report prepared for
ANM, were irrelevant for the purpose of
the present proceedings.  
<P>

128  	Mr Onody was interviewed in the investigation and the report
includes an assertion "Les stepped up on to the foot plate of
the forklift and
switched on the ignition key, which started the forklift".
<P>

129  	The photographs of the forklift which were admitted into
evidence at the hearing were taken by a member of the accident investigation
team at about 6.45 pm on 4 November 1995, that is about four and three quarter
hours after the accident happened.  These photographs
show "the drive
transmission was engaged in first gear with forward selected".  This is some
evidence of the state of the gears when
the accident happened, although there
is some possibility that the gear levers had been moved in the attempts by Mr
Onody and Mr
Dyson to stop the forklift after it had started moving or in some
other way after the accident occurred and before the photographs
were taken.
<P>

130  	The report includes an assertion "investigations on Monday 6
November with Peter Pitcher (a Work Cover inspector) revealed
that the forklift
in question can in fact be started while the drive train is engaged".
<P>

131  	There was also admitted into evidence as part of the
plaintiff's case a report by a consulting engineer, Mr Buckland.
<P>

132  	In his report Mr Buckland canvassed possibilities that "Mr
Onody may have accidentally bumped the gear shift lever to the
engaged
position, as he leant into the cab to start the engine....  It may also be
possible that the plaintiff had only thought he
had engaged neutral before he
stepped down from the forklift but had not actually done so...  In either case,
however, the forklift...
should have commenced to move immediately, when the
engine was started with the gearing engaged...  A further possibility could
then
exist that the gear selector lever had vibrated into the engaged position
after the engine was started and had run for several seconds".
<P>

133  	In the report Mr Buckland said:
<P>

"It is against recommended safe work practice to leave a forklift truck parked
unattended whilst the engine is running.
<P>

The writer is of the view that Mr Onody, or any other person starting the
engine of the forklift truck, should have been requested
to sit in the
operator's seat and to remain there for as long as the engine was running.
<P>

A person so positioned could have then been able to prevent the forklift truck
moving, or could have at least warned the plaintiff
and/or stopped the truck if
it did move".
<P>

<b>Mr Dyson</b>
<P>

<b>Evidence in Chief</b>
<P>

134  	Mr Dyson gave evidence in Malco's case.  He said that he was a
fitter employed by Malco.  He had been the supervisor on the
job in Albury at
the ANM Mill.  He had come from Adelaide, where Malco is based. 
<P>

135  	There had been two stages in the work at the Mill.  Stage one
had taken four days and the plaintiff had participated in stage
one.  At the
time of the accident stage two had been proceeding for about three weeks.  The
plaintiff was "fetched back to help on
the second stage".  The employees of
Malco engaged on the second stage were himself and Mr Onody.  
<P>

136  	Malco had taken equipment to the Mill for stage two.  It was Mr
Dyson who had decided what equipment should be taken.  He
did not, however,
play any part in the ordering of the forklift.  
<P>

137  	Mr Dyson said that the forklift had arrived at the Mill on the
first day of stage two (which, if true, would have been three
weeks before the
accident happened).  Mr Dyson first saw the forklift "in the yard and I'd
signed to say it was there but I didn't
actually see the thing drive in".
<P>

138  	After the forklift was delivered it was operated, as and when
required, by the plaintiff.  Mr Dyson denied that the plaintiff
had complained
to him about the forklift, except for saying that it was an old, manual one.

<P>

139  	Mr Dyson said that on 4 November "we needed a second ladder and
I asked Bruce to go and see if he could find one".  If there
was a piece of
equipment on the site, "you borrowed it".  The plaintiff returned with the boom
lift, driving it towards the overhead
gantry.  Mr Dyson himself operated the
boom lift putting bolts in the overhead gantry.
<P>

140  	Mr Dyson's recollection was that the boom lift had stalled,
while he was in the basket.  He was nevertheless able to lower
the basket to
the floor.  The three of them, Mr Dyson, Mr Onody and the plaintiff "got our
heads together" and tried to start the
boom lift.  The idea of using the
forklift to jump start the boom lift was "a general thing" between the three of
them.
<P>

141  	Mr Dyson continued:-
<P>

"Bruce (brought) the forklift in... alongside the body of the cherry picker.
Someone got the leads out and Bruce connected them,
asked Les to start the
forklift and that is when everything went belly up...  Bruce (was) standing...
between the cherry picker and
the forklift.  He was "between the wheels, right
in the middle".  
<P>

142  	Mr Dyson could not say precisely where Mr Onody was.  Mr Dyson
himself was near the back of the forklift.  
<P>

143  	After being told by the plaintiff to turn the forklift on, "Les
reached in and turned it on... I think he went around to the
far side of the
fork from where Bruce was and turned it on" but Mr Dyson's recollection of that
was "not very good".  
<P>

144  	After Mr Onody reached into the forklift, the engine "started
ticking over".  When asked whether the forklift moved, Mr Dyson
said "I don't
think so, not straight away".   "... the next thing I recall is Bruce screaming
out in pain because the thing had moved
forward and pinned him".  Mr Dyson's
best estimate of the time lapse between the engine starting and hearing the
plaintiff scream
was "ten to twenty seconds".  
<P>

145  	Mr Onody jumped on to the forklift and "turned the ignition
off" but "nothing happened".  Mr Dyson did not actually see Mr
Onody's hand
activating the ignition switch.  Mr Dyson did not see whether Mr Onody touched
any of the other controls of the forklift.
 The forklift reached the forklift
barrier on the floor of the Mill and came back down on to the floor.  Mr Dyson
got on to the forklift
and pushed or pulled the kill switch.  He thought the
kill switch was behind the seat.  He did not do anything to any of the other
controls of the forklift.
<P>

146  	Mr Dyson did not have any certificate for driving a forklift or
any practical experience in driving a forklift.
<P>

<b>Cross-examination</b>
<P>

147  	Mr Dyson confirmed that he was the person who was in charge of
the job and who gave orders, even though "we did discuss things".
<P>

148  	Mr Dyson could not recall providing a ladder to the plaintiff,
which the plaintiff had refused to use.  He said that a longer
ladder was
required to do the last section of the overhead gantry.  Mr Dyson did not know
how high the gantry was.  "I would have
glanced through the drawings".  A
matter that "might have slipped by" him was "the height of the gantry.   Maybe
it was a fact that
I didn't notice the measurement or I hadn't sort of sat down
and studied the drawing that hard".
<P>

149  	Mr Dyson was cross-examined about the delivery docket for the
forklift.  The delivery docket included a clause "received on
hire in good
order and condition the abovementioned goods, subject to the conditions
overleaf commencing at the time indicated above.
 I have been instructed in the
safe operation of the goods so delivered".  The document admitted into evidence
was a copy of the
front of the delivery docket and there was no evidence of any
conditions overleaf.
<P>

150  	Mr Dyson signed the delivery docket on behalf of Malco.  He had
not in fact checked the condition of the forklift and he had
not been
instructed in the safe operation of the forklift.  He signed the docket,
because "I didn't read the small print".
<P>

151  	Mr Dyson could not recall the plaintiff complaining to him
about the forklift.  It was possible that he had told the plaintiff
that
Wreckair had said that the forklift delivered was the only forklift available.
Mr Dyson did not recall the plaintiff telling
him that the truck driver had
told the plaintiff that it was hard to get the gear lever of the forklift into
neutral.
<P>

152  	Mr Dyson said that the basket of the boom lift could be lowered
"through the hydraulics, without actually having the power
on".  The trio had
wanted to restart the boom lift, so as to return it to where they had obtained
it.  
<P>

153  	Mr Dyson denied "bellowing orders out" but accepted that, as he
was the leading hand, his opinion, if there was a difference
of opinion, would
prevail.
<P>

154  	Mr Dyson denied that it was a pretty noisy environment.  "It
was quiet.  There were no other machines working that day".
<P>

155  	Mr Dyson was shown a photograph of part of the cabin of the
forklift, showing the kill switch, not behind the seat but about
level with the
seat.  
<P>

156  	Mr Dyson did not recall that the plaintiff had difficulty in
clamping one of the leads to the battery of the forklift.  He
did not know why
Mr Onody had gone away from the forklift, after starting the forklift.  
<P>

157  	Mr Dyson was not aware that a diesel engine, such as the
forklift had, could not be stopped immediately, by turning off the
ignition.
<P>

158  	Mr Dyson estimated that when the boom lift and the forklift
were alongside each other for the attempted jump starting of the
boom lift, the
distance between the near side wheels of the forklift and the offside wheels of
the boom lift would have been about
a metre.
<P>

159  	In cross-examination by counsel for Skilled Mr Dyson said that
he knew that Mr Onody had no qualification or experience in
driving forklifts.
Mr Dyson knew that when the plaintiff asked Mr Onody to turn on the forklift,
the plaintiff was not himself in
a position to control the forklift.  
<P>

160  	Mr Dyson was cross-examined by counsel for Syd-Fam.  
<P>

161  	Mr Dyson said that at some time on 4 November a stage had been
reached in the work, when the next step was to fix bolts in
the gantry frame
which had been erected and which was about ten to fifteen feet above floor
level.  Mr Dyson accepted that this was
riggers work and that the only person
qualified to do the work was the plaintiff, yet Mr Dyson himself had got into
the basket of
the boom lift and had put the bolts in the holes.
<P>

162  	In regard to Mr Dyson's estimate of the time lapse between Mr
Onody turning on the forklift and the plaintiff calling out,
Mr Dyson agreed
that it could have been less than ten seconds and as little as five seconds.
<P>

163  	Mr Dyson was cross-examined by counsel for Lift Truck Services
and Liftqip.
<P>

164  	Mr Dyson said that he had not been looking at the forklift
before he heard the plaintiff cry out.  Mr Dyson was then about
two metres from
the rear wheels of the forklift.  After hearing the plaintiff cry out, Mr Dyson
ran around to the right hand side
of the forklift (that is the offside).  The
forklift was then moving very slowly forward.  Mr Dyson did not know whether
the tines
of the forklift were on the ground.
<P>

<b>Further cross-examination</b>
<P>

165  	Mr Dyson was recalled after Mr Harders had given evidence.  He
was cross-examined by counsel for Prevwreck about what had
happened when Mr
Harders delivered the forklift to the Mill.  Mr Dyson had little recollection
of what had happened.  However, he
denied that the deliverer of the forklift
had shown Mr Dyson how to operate the forklift "he wouldn't show me, because I
wouldn't
be operating it".  Mr Dyson denied that the deliverer had shown him
the gears or the handbrake. "It's pointless telling me that sort
of thing".  Mr
Dyson could not remember whether the deliverer had asked Mr Dyson whether he
had a forklift ticket.  If Mr Dyson had
been asked, he would have said "no".
Mr Dyson did not remember the person who delivered the forklift giving "a
little lecture...
in which he gave helpful hints about how to operate this
vehicle".
<P>

<b>Mr Onody</b>
<P>

<b>Evidence in Chief</b>
<P>

166  	Mr Onody gave evidence that he was a boilermaker/welder
employed by Malco.  He did not have any certificate as a forklift
driver.  
<P>

167  	Mr Onody said that when the forklift was brought alongside the
boom lift, the two vehicles were a few feet, if not more, apart.
 The plaintiff
and Mr Onody were in the space between the vehicles.  
<P>

168  	Mr Onody got the welding leads from Malco's equipment
container.  Both Mr Onody and the plaintiff worked on connecting the
leads to
the boom lift's battery.  Both of them, and then only the plaintiff, worked at
connecting the leads to the forklift's battery.
 
<P>

169  	The plaintiff said to Mr Onody "turn the ignition on, start the
forklift, it won't move".  Mr Onody stepped up on to the foot
plate on the left
hand side of the forklift, leaned into the forklift and turned the ignition
key, thereby starting the forklift.
 
<P>

170  	Mr Onody was asked "did your arm touch any other control when
you did that?" and he replied, "no, it did not".  After turning
the ignition
key Mr Onody pulled his arm back.  He was asked, "did you touch any other
control when you brought your arm back?" and
he replied, "no.  I did not".
<P>

171  	Mr Onody then stepped off the foot plate.  The plaintiff was
standing to the right of him.  Mr Onody "headed towards my tools
and tool box
by the conveyors".
<P>

172  	Mr Onody heard the plaintiff call out.  "I turned around... the
forklift (was) running off the top of Bruce... I ran over
to the fork to turn
it off... I turned the ignition off... nothing at all (happened)".  Mr Onody
did not do anything to any of the
other controls of the forklift.  Mr Onody saw
"Peter running around the right hand side of the fork and he pulled the switch
there
after he found it and then it stopped and we went over to Bruce".
<P>

173  	Mr Onody said his best estimate of the time which elapsed
between Mr Onody turning on the engine and his hearing the plaintiff
yell out
was "half a minute, a minute".  In the meantime Mr Onody had walked about ten
metres away from the forklift.  
<P>

<b>Cross-examination</b>
<P>

174  	In cross-examination Mr Onody said that when he started the
forklift the forklift did not jump or move at all.  
<P>

175  	Mr Onody said that he had been on the left hand side of the
forklift, both when he turned it on and when he attempted to turn
it off.  He
thought that he had been standing on the foot plate on both occasions.
<P>

176  	Mr Onody said "Bruce had some grizzles about the forklift.. I
think the gears were a complaint".  Mr Onody could not remember
whether the
plaintiff had made any other complaints about the forklift.  
<P>

177  	Mr Onody said that, apart from the noise of the forklift, there
was no noise at all in the Mill.  "You could hear quite easily
the sound of the
forklift".
<P>

<b>Mr Anderson</b>
<P>

178  	Three reports by Mr Anderson, an expert engineer, were admitted
into evidence in Malco's case and Mr Anderson gave oral evidence.
<P>

179  	Parts of Mr Anderson's principal report of April 1998 were in
the following terms (in the report Mr Anderson refers to the
forklift as
"vehicle 1").
<P>

"21	There is insufficient data to determine with any certainty what caused
Vehicle 1 to commence moving forward some time after
the engine was started.
<P>

22	Potential mechanical faults which might have contributed to Vehicle 1 moving
forward, listed in order of their probability of
occurring are:-
<P>

2.2.1 Incorrectly adjusted and/or maintained hand brake mechanism;
<P>

2.2.2 Poorly maintained `Forward - Neutral - Reverse' mechanism producing;-
<P>

2.2.2.1 An imprecise selector operation which gave the driver the impression
that `Neutral' had been selected when `Forward' was
actually selected;
<P>

2.2.2.2 A time delay, depending on the `Forward - Reverse' gearbox design,
between the engine starting and the transmission `taking
up' the drive.  This
is consistent with the `Forward' being engaged, either by the driver or by
another person on Vehicle 1;
<P>

2.2.2.3 A looseness in the selector mechanism which makes it easy for `Forward'
to be engaged inadvertently by a person other than
the driver on Vehicle 1;
or
<P>

2.2.2.4 A looseness in the selector mechanism which, depending on the `Forward
- Reverse' gearbox design, allowed the selector level
to vibrate and to engage
`Forward'....
<P>

4.1	Vehicle 1 was a diesel powered fork lift truck.  Thus the engine is started
using a key similar to the ignition key used on
passenger cars but is stopped
using a stop button - sometimes referred to as a `kill switch';
<P>

4.2	Vehicle 1 was equipped with a 4 speed manual transmission which was
operated by a floor mounted gear lever and a separate `Forward
-
Neutral-Reverse' mechanism operated by a second, floor mounted, lever.  In
addition a parking brake was provided which was operated
by a third, floor
mounted, lever.
<P>

4.3	The engine start key noted in Para 4.1 was located on an instrument panel
to the right hand side of the steering wheel...
<P>

4.4	The three levers noted in paras 4.1 and 4.2 were located to the left of the
driver...
<P>

4.5	Photograph number 5 shows the handbrake lever in an almost vertical
orientation which would be ergonomically awkward to operate.
 The photograph
caption states `Handbrake is not fully engaged'.  This suggests that the
handbrake was incorrectly adjusted.
<P>

4.9	Of particular significance is that the design of Vehicle 1 appears to be
such that there is no interlock in the starter circuit
to prevent the engine
being started with the drive system engaged.  Note that this is quite normal in
automobiles with manual transmission
but those with automatic transmissions
are, almost without exception, fitted with such an interlock...
<P>

5.5	More design data on the transmission of Vehicle 1 is required to allow an
analysis of all possible malfunctions.  However it
is assumed that, for the
vehicle to move forward, <u>both</u> the gear lever must be moved to engage one
gear (1st being normal for slow speed manoeuvring) and the Forward -
Neutral-Reverse lever
must be moved to `Forward'.  It would be expected that
the driver would, on leaving the vehicle, move only one of these levers to
`Neutral' and this would probably be the more convenient lever - in this case
the `Forward - Neutral - Reverse lever.
<P>

5.6	If the `Forward - Neutral - Reverse lever was uncertain in its operation
due to a stiff action, the driver might think that
he has selected `Neutral'
when `Forward' is still engaged.
<P>

5.7	If the `Forward - Neutral - Reverse' lever was uncertain in its operation
due to looseness in the mechanism:-
<P>

the driver might think that he has selected `Neutral' when `Forward' is still
engaged,
<P>

it might be possible for the lever to vibrate towards and engage in `Forward'
under the influence of engine vibration - depending
on the design of the
`Forward - Reverse' mechanism; or
<P>

it might be easy to for a person on the vehicle - other than the driver - to
inadvertently knock the lever into `Forward'.
<P>

5.8	The handbrake did not prevent Vehicle 1 from moving.  This could have been
due to one or more of the following:-
<P>

the handbrake design being incapable of holding Vehicle 1 against the tractive
effort provided by the engine with 1st gear selected;
<P>

the handbrake being incorrectly adjusted such that it was awkward for the
driver to apply adequate force to the end of the lever
- a distinct possibility
as shown in Photograph number 5 and/or
<P>

the handbrake being inadequately maintained - eg worn or oil soaked brake
linings.
<P>

5.9	The delay between the engine being started and Vehicle 1 starting to move
could have been caused by:-
<P>

The `Forward - Neutral - Reverse' lever vibrating to `Forward'.  This would
depend on:-
<P>

a suitable design of the `Forward - Reverse' mechanism; and
<P>

the amount of looseness in the selecting linkage; and be consistent with 
<P>

the driver having left Vehicle 1 in `Neutral'; or
<P>

A time lag in transmission `taking up' which would:-
<P>

depend on the design of the `Forward - Reverse' mechanism; and
<P>

be consistent with the driver leaving Vehicle 1 in `Forward', both
possibilities
<P>

Inferring a fault with the maintenance of Vehicle 1.
<P>

5.10 	Note that the author has not been able to inspect Vehicle 1 or a similar
vehicle.  Nor has the author been able to study the
workshop manual of Vehicle
1."
<P>

180  	Some of the assumptions made by Mr Anderson in his report were
not established by the evidence given at the hearing.  In parts
of his report
Mr Anderson proceeded on the assumption that the last driver of the forklift
(that is the plaintiff) had moved only
one of the gears to neutral and that
this would probably have been the forward-reverse lever.  
<P>

181  	Mr Anderson was subsequently supplied with some of the service
records of the forklift, a service manual and a parts catalogue
for the
forklift.  After considering this additional material he said that he would not
alter any of the conclusions in his earlier
report.
<P>

182  	Mr Anderson's final report contained his comments on a report
by Mr McCaffery, an expert retained by Lift Truck Services and
Liftqip.  The
report by Mr McCaffery was not subsequently tendered and Mr McCaffery did not
give oral evidence.  In part of paragraph
9 of this third report Mr Anderson
said:-
<P>

"If the park brake had been well maintained and applied correctly, the engine
would have been subjected to a significant load and:-
<P>

either stalled shortly after being started; or
<P>

increased its output under the control of its governor and produced more noise;
which
<P>

could have given the workers an audible warning.
<P>

If the park brake had been out of adjustment, it could have offered little or
no resistance to vehicle movement at all".
<P>

183  	In oral evidence in chief Mr Anderson said that, with regard to
the main gears, it was necessary to use the clutch to move
from neutral into
gear but it was not necessary to use the clutch to move from gear into
neutral.
<P>

<b>Cross-examination</b>
<P>

184  	In cross-examination Mr Anderson said that the forklift had
what he called a hybrid transmission.  He continued:-
<P>

"It comprises a four-speed with neutral mechanical gear box, but that has no
reverse gear built into it.  In series with that, is
a forward-reverse section
of the gear box which enables the operator to decide whether he's going forward
or backwards.  That is
operated hydraulically.  So for the transmission to
produce drive, the clutch has to be engaged, one of the gears in the gear box
has to be engaged, the forward-reverse lever needs to be engaged in one or the
other and the engine must be running to develop hydraulic
pressure to engage
the forward-reverse.... And the handbrake has to be released".
<P>

185  	Mr Anderson was cross-examined by counsel for Syd-Fam.
<P>

186  	In regard to paragraph 4.9 of his first report, Mr Anderson
said that he was not aware of any such device having been fitted
to a vehicle
with a manual transmission.  Such a device could have been fitted to the
forklift.  However, for it to be a satisfactory
installation, the manufacturer
of the power shift part of the transmission would have had to have incorporated
the device into the
design and supply of the forklift.  
<P>

187  	Mr Anderson was asked:-
<P>

"Are you familiar as to whether or not in a forklift of this age and type, the
manual transmission had a propensity to move forward
after the engine had been
turned on, by reason of a delay in the build up of the hydraulic pressure ...?
And he replied:-
<P>

I have no direct experience ... that that is what I would expect".
<P>

188  	A little later in his evidence Mr Anderson said that, if the
transmission was new, he would expect the delay to be of the
order of a second;
if the transmission was worn, "it could take some seconds for the pressure to
build up and for the transmission
to engage... possibly five (seconds), at the
very outside ten... I have seen references to thirty seconds.  I wouldn't find
that
credible".  The delay would be "between the engine starting and full
pressure being developed (in the forward-reverse section of
the transmission)
to allow the engine to move off... this phenomenon of delay in the build up of
a hydraulic pressure is well known".
<P>

<b>Cross-examination by counsel for Lift Truck Services and Liftqip</b>
<P>

189  	In cross-examination Mr Anderson said that whether the forklift
was being started cold or hot might make a measurable, but
not a big,
difference in the length of the delay.  Mr Anderson said "once the engine had
been started... this delay may not be evident
subsequently.  In other words, it
is a once off event during the start up phase".
<P>

190  	If there was a delay of as long as thirty seconds, "you would
expect it to be there, both previously and subsequently... it
would be very
noticeable".
<P>

191  	If the handbrake was incorrectly adjusted or maintained, then,
if the forklift had been tested by a competent person after
the accident, Mr
Anderson would have expected the condition of the handbrake to have been
apparent.
<P>

192  	If the forklift had a looseness in the selector mechanism and
was giving a false impression that neutral had been engaged,
when in fact
forward or reverse was engaged, then Mr Anderson would have expected such a
fault to be discovered by a competent person,
if that person was looking for
such a fault.
<P>

193  	Because the forward-reverse gear mechanism is hydraulic, it can
be operated without using the clutch, even though that is
not good operating
practice.  
<P>

194  	Mr Anderson was shown a photograph of another forklift (which
became exhibit "M"), in which the battery was located externally,
mounted on a
little cross member projecting from the side of the forklift and protruding
outwards beyond the battery.  This cross
member was closer to the front wheels
of the forklift than the rear wheels. The position of the battery in the
forklift in exhibit
"M" was not the same as the position which the plaintiff
had said was the position of the battery on the forklift on 4 November 1995.
<P>

<b>Re-examination </b>
<P>

195  	Having considered a statement by Mr Drage of Lift Truck
Services and Liftqip, Mr Anderson said:
<P>

"I guess my 2.2.1 (in his report of April 1998) about incorrectly adjusted
handbrake would have to be modified, if we accept that
the handbrake when fully
applied was functioning satisfactorily ... I would have to modify 2.2.1 to
focus on the ergonomic aspects
of the handbrake, rather than (that) the
handbrake was adjusted in such a manner it was not functioning at all."
<P>

<b>Mr Moore</b>
<P>

<b>Evidence in Chief</b>
<P>

196  	Mr Moore, a supply manager employed by Malco, gave evidence
about the hiring of the forklift. Mr Moore identified the purchase
order dated
26 October 1995 from Malco to "Wreckair Hire" for the hire of a 5 tonne
forklift. Mr Moore wrote the handwritten entries
on the purchase order.
<P>

197  	Mr Moore gave evidence that before midday on 26 October he had
spoken on the telephone to Mr Hudson of Wreckair (Prevwreck)
in Wodonga and
arranged for the hire of the forklift. 
<P>

198  	Mr Moore gave evidence of what he said was the practice of
Malco in preparing purchase orders. There were four copies of the
purchase
order.  Mr Moore would write particulars of the order on the top white copy and
what he wrote would be reproduced on the
lower carbon copies. The white copy
had Malco's conditions of contract printed on the reverse side of it.  The
white copy of the
purchase order went straight to a mail bag for dispatch to
the party from whom the goods were being ordered. 
<P>

199  	The document is called a "Purchase Order" and its provisions,
including the conditions on the reverse of the white copy of
the order, are apt
to apply to a sale of goods but not a hiring of goods. The party to whom the
order is directed is described in
the order as the "seller".
<P>

200  	Condition 8 of the conditions on the reverse of the white copy
of the purchase order, on which Malco sought particularly to
rely in the
present case, is in the following terms:
<P>

"In the event any article sold and delivered hereunder shall be defective in
any respect whatsoever, seller will immediately indemnify
and save harmless
purchaser from all loss or payment of all sums of money by reason of all
accidents injuries or damages to persons
or property that may happen or occur
in connection with the use or sale of such article and are contributed to by
the said defective
condition."
<P>

201  	Mr Moore also identified an invoice from Prevwreck for the hire
of the forklift from 31 October 1995 to 9 November 1995 and
a "return from
hire" document prepared by Prevwreck dated 9 November 1995. 
<P>

202  	Mr Moore said that on many previous occasions Malco had hired
equipment from Prevwreck, using a purchase order in the same
form. 
<P>

203  	Mr Moore also identified three purchase orders from Malco to
Skilled for the hire of labour to be used at the ANM Mill. These
purchase
orders were on the same form of order as the order for the supply of the
forklift.  These orders were not shown to relate
to the plaintiff's labour. The
same form of purchase order was used for the hire of the plaintiff's labour. An
invoice from Skilled
to Malco dated 4 November for the reimbursement of wages
already paid by Skilled to its employee, the plaintiff, was produced.
<P>

<b>Cross-examination.</b>
<P>

204  	In cross-examination Mr Moore said that he had written the word
"hire" on the front of the purchase order for the forklift.
 Mr Moore had
written "confirmation Steve Hudson (of Prevwreck)" on the purchase order, on 26
October 1995 at the time of the telephone
conversation.
<P>

205  	In cross-examination Mr Moore said that he was absolutely
certain that what he had said in chief was the usual system of raising
and
dispatching purchase orders had been used in ordering the forklift from
Prevwreck on 26 October 1995. He said "that is what I
did with every single
purchase order that I wrote". He denied that there was any other system than
the system he had described in
his evidence.
<P>

206  	It was then put to Mr Moore that there was in fact another
system in operation, whereby the front of the purchase order only
would be
faxed by Malco to the supplier.  At first Mr Moore denied that there was any
other system, then he admitted that there was
such another system but said that
he would not have used it, then he said he could not recollect using it and
finally he retracted
his evidence that he had not sent a fax to Prevwreck on 26
October.  He conceded that his recollection of events was "slightly"
mistaken.
<P>

207  	Mr Moore was shown a document by cross-examining counsel, which
was a facsimile copy of the front of the purchase order. The
following evidence
was then given:-
<P>

"Q.	As you sit here today, you do not recall putting out for mailing the
original purchase order that you had raised that day in
relation to
Wreckair?
<P>

A.	Not exactly, no.
<P>

Q..	No.  And you agree, don't you, having refreshed your memory about this by
looking at the document, that what you faxed to Mr
Hudson was only one page of
the purchase order document?
<P>

A.	Yes".
<P>

<b>Re-examination</b>
<P>

208  	In re-examination Mr Moore said that there was a practice that,
if a fax was sent to a supplier, "you immediately posted the
hard copy".
<P>

<b>Mr Hudson</b>
<P>

<b>Evidence in Chief</b>
<P>

209  	Mr Steven Hudson gave evidence in Prevwreck's case. In November
1995 he was the depot manager for Prevwreck in Wodonga. 
<P>

210  	In late October 1995 he received a telephone call from Mr Moore
of Malco about the hiring of a forklift. Mr Hudson made a
note on a telephone
order form, noting, inter alia, the weight of the truck needed, the dimensions
of the tines, "ANM" and "Peter
Dyson".
<P>

211  	Mr Hudson said "we didn't have that size in our depot at the
time, so ... we arranged an on-hire from Lift Truck Services".
<P>

212  	Mr Hudson did not see any written confirmation of the oral
order from Malco but any such written confirmation would not necessarily
have
come to him. 
<P>

<b>Cross-examination</b>
<P>

213  	In cross-examination Mr Hudson said that he made a telephone
call to Lift Truck Services on 26 or 27 October 1995 to arrange
the on-hire. He
mentioned the size of the forklift, the tine requirements, the date the
forklift was needed by and the length of
the hire. 
<P>

214  	Prior to October 1995 Prevwreck had on occasions obtained
equipment such as forklifts from Lift Truck Services for on-hiring.
<P>

215  	Mr Hudson did not tell Mr Moore of Malco that a forklift would
be obtained from a source other than Prevwreck to be hired
to Malco.
<P>

216  	Mr Hudson could not recall whether he informed Lift Truck
Services or Liftqip of the client Prevwreck was going to on-hire
the forklift
to. Normally, when Prevwreck was on-hiring, Prevwreck would not inform the
party supplying the forklift of the ultimate
client.
<P>

<b>Mr Harders</b>
<P>

<b>Examination in Chief</b>
<P>

217  	Mr Jason Harders gave evidence that in 1995 he was working for
Prevwreck in Wodonga as a driver/yardman. Mr Harders did not
state his age but
he had left school only in 1988. In 1994 he had obtained a licence to drive
forklifts.
<P>

218  	In October 1995 he was instructed to pick up the forklift from
Lift Truck Services and deliver it to the ANM Mill. At the
premises of Lift
Truck Services he drove the forklift onto his truck. At the ANM Mill he drove
the forklift off the truck.
<P>

219  	It was then sought by counsel for Prevwreck to adduce evidence
from Mr Harders of what had allegedly transpired between Mr
Harders on the one
hand and Mr Dyson, Mr Onody and the plaintiff on the other hand. None of the
plaintiff, Mr Dyson and Mr Onody
had been asked questions about these matters
in cross-examination by counsel for Prevwreck. I allowed evidence to be given
by Mr
Harders on the voir dire for the purpose of assisting me in determining
whether the proposed evidence should be admitted. I subsequently
ruled that the
evidence given on the voir dire should stand as evidence in the trial. A
consequence of the course I adopted was that
the plaintiff and Mr Dyson had to
be recalled, so as to be given an opportunity of responding to what Mr Harders
had alleged had
happened.
<P>

220  	Mr Harders said that after driving the forklift off the
delivery truck at the Mill, he drove it a few metres and parked it.
He spoke to
Mr Dyson. "There was about three other blokes as well and I just showed them
the safe operating and safe handling instructions
of the vehicle". He said that
he said to Mr Dyson "before starting the forklift, the forklift should be in
neutral with the handbrake
applied". He showed the others the safety controls
of the vehicle and how to operate them, ie the main gears, the forward-reverse
gear and the handbrake. He claimed that he pointed out the use of the main
gears and the forward-reverse gear. He said "I asked all
present if they had a
forklift ticket, which all of them nodded "yes" and I asked them at the end of
my instructions if they fully
understood what I had just said and they all said
"yes", nodded "yes". I asked them for a forklift ticket first and they all
replied
"yes"."
<P>

221  	One of the three drove the forklift in Mr Harders' presence
"the gentleman hopped in the forklift and did everything like
I explained".
<P>

<b>Cross-examination</b>
<P>

222  	In cross-examination Mr Harders was asked about picking up the
forklift from the premises of Lift Truck Services. He said
"as I walked in the
gate there was a bloke in overalls, who I thought was a mechanic, just closing
the machine with the oil and water,
as if to finish running it up, to make sure
it was right to go". The man in overalls said "it is ready to go". Mr Harders
did not
know who the man in overalls was. Mr Harders could not recall whether
the man in overalls gave him any instructions on how to drive
the forklift.
<P>

223  	The cross-examination of Mr Harders was resumed after the
plaintiff and Mr Dyson had been recalled for further cross-examination
regarding Mr Harders' evidence in chief. 
<P>

224  	Mr Harders asserted that Mr Dyson was "already there", when he
delivered the forklift at the Mill. As he spoke to Mr Dyson
"the other men
walked over".
<P>

225  	The version of what had happened at the Mill when the forklift
was delivered, which Mr Harders had given in evidence in chief
was challenged
in cross-examination. It was put to him that if, as he asserted, all of the
group had said that they had forklift
tickets, it was unlikely that he would
have gone on to say what he alleged he had said about how to operate the
forklift. Mr Harders
replied "I felt silly saying it to them because they had a
bit of a laugh. The point is, I had to ask them if they had licences.
And I
have been at Wreckair for six years and no one else has ever been run over by a
forklift that I delivered".
<P>

226  	Mr Harders was asked "do you resent being here?" (ie being in
the court room giving evidence) and he replied "that is obvious".
He resented
"being here", because "when I'm not at work, I'm not getting paid". He then
asserted "there was nothing wrong with the
forklift". He agreed that all of the
men he said he had spoken to were substantially older than he was. He
reiterated that he had
told all of the men where the handbrake was and that
there was a button on the top of the handbrake and how to apply the handbrake.

<P>

<b>Mr Drage</b>
<P>

227  	At a stage in the hearing when, according to what I was told by
counsel, the only lay evidence remaining to be given on behalf
of any parties
other than Lift Truck Services and Liftqip, was the completion of Mr Harders'
evidence (his examination in chief having
been substantially completed) and
further evidence by the plaintiff and Mr Dyson (and possibly Mr Onody) in
response to Mr Harders'
evidence, I said to counsel for Lift Truck Services and
Liftqip that if he wished to call lay evidence he should proceed to call
it.
Counsel for Lift Truck Services and Liftqip then called Mr Drage.
<P>

<b>Evidence in Chief</b>
<P>

228  	Mr Drage gave evidence that he was the managing director of
both Lift Truck Services and Liftqip. Lift Truck Services carried
on the
business of selling and servicing forklifts, including Manitou forklifts.
Liftqip carried on the business of renting out forklifts.
Lift Truck Services
carried out the maintenance and repair of forklifts being rented out by
Liftqip. Mr Drage had worked with forklifts
since 1970.
<P>

229  	The forklift in this case had been purchased second-hand from a
Manitou dealer and sold to Syd-Fam in about 1988 or 1989.
<P>

230  	In the early 1990's Syd-Fam had complained that the forklift
had a damaged transmission. According to Mr Drage, there was
no subsequent
trouble with the transmission of the forklift.
<P>

231  	In August 1995 the forklift was taken back by Liftqip. The
forklift was getting water in the oil in the engine and the forklift
was
surplus to Syd-Fam's requirements.
<P>

232  	Mr Drage had a conversation with Mr Caddy of Syd-Fam. Mr Caddy
said that he did not want to spend any more money on the forklift.
Mr Drage
suggested, and Mr Caddy agreed, that Mr Drage should take the forklift back,
put the forklift into operational condition
at his expense, sell the forklift,
recoup his expenditure and account to Syd-Fam for the balance of the proceeds
of sale.
<P>

233  	Pursuant to this arrangement Lift Truck Services carried out
repairs to the engine of the forklift. The repairs were finished
on the day
Prevwreck picked up the forklift, that is 31 October 1995.
<P>

234  	On that day at approximately 1 pm Mr Drage himself drove the
forklift. Mr Drage drove the forklift around the premises of
Lift Truck
Services "checked the brakes and steering and normal hydraulic function".
<P>

235  	Prevwreck loaded the forklift to be taken away. Mr Drage did
not know where the forklift was ultimately going. On numerous
previous
occasions Mr Drage had provided forklifts for Prevwreck.
<P>

236  	The next thing that happened regarding the forklift, so far as
Mr Drage was concerned, was that on 4 November 1995 he received
a telephone
call from an employee of ANM. 
<P>

237  	On Monday 6 November 1995 Mr Drage was asked by a Workcover
inspector to go to the ANM Mill. Mr Drage and Mr Collins, a mechanic
employed
by Lift Truck Services who had been the last person to work on the forklift on
31 October 1995, went to the ANM Mill. 
<P>

238  	At the Mill Mr Drage saw the forklift. He met the Workcover
inspector, Mr Pitcher, and some ANM employees. Mr Drage was asked
by the
inspector to start the forklift. However, the battery of the forklift was flat.
The inspector said, "I want to see it going".
The forklift was jump started,
using jumper leads and Mr Collins' vehicle. At the request of the inspector, Mr
Drage put the forklift's
forward-reverse gear in forward, reverse and neutral.
He thought the lever was "a little firm". He did not notice anything different
about the forklift from when he had driven it on 31 October.
<P>

239  	Mr Drage then did a handbrake test on the forklift. When the
forklift was in a higher gear, the engine almost stalled and
the forklift did
not move, that is the handbrake held the forklift. When the forklift was in a
low gear and the engine was "under
some revs", that is not merely idling, the
forklift moved marginally, "the revs actually picked up, so the noise became
louder".
The Workcover inspector made some notes and asked Mr Drage to leave
the forklift at the Mill.
<P>

240  	Later Mr Drage was notified that the forklift could be picked
up and Mr Collins picked up the forklift from the Mill. 
<P>

241  	Mr Drage identified the position of the battery on the
forklift, as being near portion of the foot plate on the side of the
forklift.
However, he said that "the battery sits behind the front wheel and deeper into
the machine beside the step plate". He had
never seen a battery on a Manitou
forklift in the position which the plaintiff had indicated, behind a panel on
the side of the forklift.
<P>

242  	Mr Drage was asked to compare the forklift in this case and the
forklift shown in the photograph which had become exhibit
M. He said that the
position of the battery on the two forklifts was similar but the foot plate of
the forklift in exhibit M was
smaller.
<P>

243  	When Mr Drage got the forklift back after the accident, he
inspected the forklift. He tested the brakes and gears of the forklift
and did
not find anything wrong. He did not have any information as to how it was
alleged the accident had happened.
<P>

244  	Mr Drage was asked a number of questions, in which he was asked
to make assumptions. Mr Drage said inter alia that the forklift
would not move,
unless both gear boxes were engaged. If the forward-reverse gear lever was
bumped, "not a great deal" of force would
be required to move it into gear from
neutral. If the forward-reverse gear lever was in neutral, then to move it into
forward, the
gear lever would need to be moved towards the front of the
forklift. It would be possible to bump the main gear lever out of neutral
into
gear.
<P>

245  	In January 1996 Mr Drage had taken the forklift to
Melbourne.
<P>

<b>Cross-examination</b>
<P>

246  	Mr Drage was cross-examined by counsel for Prevwreck.
<P>

247  	Mr Drage said that there had been a defect in the transmission
of the forklift when the forklift had first been purchased
(ie in about 1989).
Mr Drage had arranged for the forklift to be delivered direct to Syd-Fam's
premises. The pipe providing hydraulic
pressure to the forward-reverse gear had
split and this defect was remedied. No work was then done on the gears
themselves. 
<P>

248  	If a gear was "sloppy", that would indicate a worn mechanism
between the gear shift lever itself and the gear it was required
to shift,
"occurring through long use".
<P>

249  	Mr Drage was cross-examined by counsel for Syd-Fam.
<P>

250  	Mr Drage was cross-examined about the hire agreement document
for the hire of the forklift from Liftqip to Prevwreck. This
was a very simple
document. Mr Drage was directed to the part of the document where the printed
words "condition report" appear and
the word "fair" has been written. Mr Drage
said that the word "fair" had been written by Mr Collins. Mr Collins had
inspected the
forklift before it went out on hire.
<P>

251  	Mr Drage said that the cause of water in the oil in the engine
of the forklift in August 1995 was that the piston liner seals
were leaking.
The forklift remained at Lift Truck Services' premises from August 1995 to 31
October 1995, when the forklift went
out on hire to Prevwreck. During this
period work was carried out on the forklift by Mr Collins and by other
mechanics.
<P>

252  	The arrangement Liftqip entered into with Prevwreck for the
hire by Prevwreck of the forklift was entered into, without the
knowledge of Mr
Caddy of Syd-Fam.
<P>

253  	Mr Drage was cross-examined by counsel for Malco.
<P>

254  	Mr Drage accepted that he had told someone from Prevwreck that
Liftqip had a forklift, that it was being repaired and that
it was not
immediately available. It would have been normal for Prevwreck to have told Mr
Drage what date Prevwreck wanted the forklift
from. The forklift was still
being repaired on the day it was picked up by Prevwreck. Mr Drage knew that the
forklift was required
by Prevwreck for the purpose of on-hiring it.
<P>

255  	Mr Drage was cross-examined about Lift Truck Services' work
sheets for work done on the forklift. The work sheets set out
a large number of
printed items of work under the heading "Points to be Serviced", alongside each
of which there is a box. On most
of the work sheets none of the boxes had any
tick or cross in it. However, Mr Drage said "that check list has nothing to do
with
repair and maintenance ... just to carry out regular maintenance (ie
servicing)".
<P>

256  	The final work sheet dated 31 October 1995 had, after the
printed words "repairs carried out", the handwritten words "finish
off truck
top up oils and test".  There was no written record of what tests had been
carried out by Lift Truck Services.
<P>

257  	Mr Drage himself used the handbrake, when he drove the forklift
on 31 October 1995. "It didn't appear obvious to me that it
was anything other
than correct operation". "Once you pull the handbrake on, you would know
whether it was working or not or out
of adjustment". If an employee of Lift
Truck Services had noticed anything wrong about the handbrake, he would have
made a note against
"repairs required".
<P>

258  	Mr Drage drove the forklift on 31 October and in that sense he
himself checked the clutch operation of the forklift.
<P>

259  	Mr Drage did not carry out any specific tests of the handbrake
or the clutch, apart from driving the forklift around the premises
of Lift
Truck Services.
<P>

260  	Mr Drage was asked a series of questions about how the forklift
might perform under certain conditions.
<P>

261  	If the forklift was started, with the handbrake on and the
forward-reverse lever in forward and the gear lever in first gear,
then "I
doubt whether the engine would fire".
<P>

262  	If the forward-reverse lever was in neutral, the gear lever was
in first gear and the forklift was started, then vibration
from the engine
could not cause the forward-reverse lever to go out of neutral into forward.
<P>

263  	If the forward-reverse lever was in forward, the gear lever was
in neutral and the forklift was started, then "extremely bad
vibration" could
cause the gear lever to go out of neutral into forward.
<P>

264  	If the selector forkware plates in either gear box were worn
out, this could have an effect on the operation of the relevant
gear lever.
<P>

265  	If the main gear lever was hard to get into neutral, that could
be because of a lack of oil, a bent main input shaft or burs
on the shaft.
<P>

266  	If the main gear lever was hard to get into neutral "you
generally bend it, trying to get it into neutral ... you would know
you weren't
in neutral". In such circumstances, there could be some problem in the box area
below the lever. The operator "should
be able to feel a definite detent, a
definite sensation, when he dropped it out of gear, through the handle".
<P>

267  	If the forward-reverse lever was hard to get into neutral, that
would usually be due to an external problem, that is to the
presence of some
foreign body stuck in some part of the mechanism.
<P>

268  	Mr Drage disputed that a poorly maintained forward-reverse
mechanism could produce an "imprecise selector operation".
<P>

269  	Mr Drage asserted that, notwithstanding what was said in the
vehicle manual, the forward-reverse lever was not operated by
hydraulic
power.
<P>

270  	Mr Drage said that some seconds would elapse in the driver
starting the forklift and then putting the forward-reverse lever
into forward
and the main gear lever into a gear, so that when the driver then applied the
accelerator to move forward, he would
not notice any delay in the forklift
moving forward.
<P>

271  	If the forward-reverse lever was in forward and the main gear
lever in gear and the engine was started, (the handbrake not
being applied),
then the forklift would move forward "almost instantaneously".
<P>

272  	Mr Drage initially disagreed, but then accepted, that the
forklift could be started, with the forward-reverse lever in forward
and the
main gear lever in gear. "If it was in gear, both gears, and you hit the key, I
believe it would move, it would almost instantaneously
start (moving forward)".
Mr Drage repeated that if, in those circumstances, the handbrake was on, "I
don't believe it would fire
at all".
<P>

273  	If the forward-reverse lever was in forward and the main lever
was in gear, then it could be said that "the drive train is
engaged".  Mr Drage
was then shown the ANM report of the investigation into the accident and his
attention was directed to the part
of the report asserting that the forklift
could be started "while the drive train is engaged".  Mr Drage said that he had
already
agreed with that, as he in fact had.  He did not believe that he had
performed that test on 6 November 1995, that is started the
forklift in
gear.
<P>

274  	Mr Drage said that when on 6 November 1995 at the Mill he was
asked to apply the handbrake, he pulled the handbrake to a position,
where,
according to other evidence given by him, the handbrake was "about half way"
applied.
<P>

275  	Mr Drage was cross-examined by counsel for the plaintiff.
<P>

276  	When Mr Drage saw the forklift on 6 November 1995, it had been
moved from the position it was in when the photographs had
been taken at about
6.45 pm on 4 November.
<P>

277  	Mr Drage was cross-examined about his assertion that,
notwithstanding what was said in the vehicle manual, the forward-reverse
gear
was a manual, and not a hydraulically operated, mechanism. He said, "I remember
distinctly it used to grind, if you didn't put
your foot on the clutch". Mr
Drage doubted whether the forklift could have been modified from its original
state.
<P>

278  	Mr Drage said that, if the forklift had started on the key
being turned (as Mr Onody had said) and the handbrake was on, then
the forklift
could not have been in gear.
<P>

279  	Mr Drage could not see how it could have happened that the
forklift, after a delay of some seconds, then moved forward. "I
can't see how
it could do it". For the forklift to move forward, the forward-reverse lever
would have had to have been forward and
the main gear lever in gear.
<P>

280  	The forklift was picked up by Prevwreck a day late, that is on
31 October and not 30 October.
<P>

281  	After Mr Drage had driven the forklift on 31 October, he said
to Mr Collins words to the effect "do a final check" or similar
words. Mr Drage
would have driven the forklift on 31 October, only after he had seen Mr Collins
driving it. Mr Drage wanted to drive
the forklift "to see how it performed",
even though Mr Collins had worked on the forklift and driven it, because inter
alia Mr Drage
wanted to sell the forklift.
<P>

282  	The Liftqip hire agreement would have been filled out and would
have been signed by Mr Harders before the forklift left Lift
Truck Services'
premises. Mr Drage himself first saw the hire agreement after the forklift had
been sent out on hire to Prevwreck.
<P>

283  	Mr Drage said that the condition report `doesn't have any
bearing on the mechanical condition of the unit". The condition
report related
only to the external appearance of the unit. There is no written acknowledgment
by the hirer of the condition the
unit was in, when it went out on hire. As Mr
Drage did not himself complete the condition report on the hire agreement, he
did not
know why the word "fair" had been selected. He agreed that the word
"fair" was non-specific.
<P>

284  	The forklift had been sitting around for some time in Syd-Fam's
yard before it was returned to Liftqip. It had then been in
Lift Truck
Services' yard for about three months. Lift Truck Services dismantled the
forklift and confirmed that there was a fault.
After the arrangement between Mr
Drage and Mr Caddy had been entered into, Lift Truck Services went ahead and
repaired the forklift.
<P>

285  	Mr Drage said that Mr Caddy had agreed that the forklift could
be hired out (but not, it would seem, to the particular hiring).
<P>

286  	This particular forklift was the only five tonne forklift
Liftqip had at the time it was contacted. Mr Drage accepted that
he agreed with
Prevwreck that Liftqip would make available a five tonne forklift at midday on
30 October, whereas in fact the forklift
had been made available at some time
after 1.30 pm on 31 October.
<P>

287  	The position of the battery on the forklift was underneath the
floor plate of the driver's cabin and above the foot plate.
<P>

288  	The forklift had in fact been made up from a diesel tractor.
<P>

289  	Mr Drage was asked questions about the forklift, as shown in
the photographs taken on 4 November 1995, and the forklift shown
in exhibit M,
which he said were "identical".  Mr Drage later accepted that there were a
number of differences between the two forklifts,
in the dimensions of the foot
plate, a strut, a railing (which did not appear in the forklift shown in
exhibit M) and the appearance
and position of the exhaust chimney or pipe.
<P>

290  	Mr Drage was cross-examined by counsel for Skilled.
<P>

291  	Mr Drage said that he had seen other forklifts with their
batteries in the same position as the battery on the forklift in
exhibit M. A
page of the operation manual for International Diesel Trucks was later
tendered, showing the battery as being located
in front of the radiator.
<P>

<b>Re-examination</b>
<P>

292  	In re-examination Mr Drage said that he was not aware of any
tests for the handbrake and the gears, apart from simply pulling
the handbrake
on and moving the gear levers.
<P>

293  	If the battery in the forklift had been in front of the
radiator, it would not have been in the position which the plaintiff
had
indicated as being the position of the battery.
<P>

294  	Mr Drage was recalled, after Mr Morgan and Mr Caddy had given
evidence. In his further evidence Mr Drage said that between
August and
November 1995 he knew of no fault in the transmission or gear box of the
forklift. Mr Drage had not seen a switch of the
type which Mr Morgan said in
his evidence he had installed, otherwise than in the mining industry.
<P>

295  	In further cross-examination Mr Drage said that Mr Caddy had
told him in 1995 that Syd-Fam was not using the forklift and
that Mr Caddy was
not prepared to spend any money on it.  Mr Drage denied that Mr Caddy had
discussed any transmission problem with
him in 1995.
<P>

296  	Mr Drage said that he possibly could have said to Mr Caddy in
January 1996 that the forklift had been a problem, not only
for Mr Caddy,
because it had nearly killed somebody.
<P>

297  	Although, before I had asked counsel for Lift Truck Services
and Liftqip to adduce such oral lay evidence as he wished to
adduce, on the
basis that the only other oral lay evidence outstanding was evidence from Mr
Harders, whose examination in chief was
almost complete, and evidence from the
plaintiff and Mr Dyson (and possibly Mr Onody) which would be limited to
responding to Mr
Harders' evidence, I permitted counsel for Syd-Fam, after a
long adjournment of the hearing, to call two witnesses, Mr Morgan and
Mr
Caddy.
<P>

<b>Mr Morgan</b>
<P>

<b>Evidence in Chief</b>
<P>

298  	Mr Morgan gave evidence that he held a trade certificate as a
heavy vehicle mechanic.  He had served his apprenticeship with
a company
carrying on business in Singleton under the name of Bowers Drain Service.
<P>

299  	On 11 December 1996 he unloaded a Manitou forklift at his place
of employment.  I allowed Mr Morgan to continue giving evidence,
on the basis
that, if it was not subsequently established that this forklift was the same
forklift, his evidence would be disregarded.
 It was later established, and
conceded by counsel for Lift Truck Services and Liftqip, that this forklift was
the forklift which
had injured the plaintiff.
<P>

300  	Mr Morgan was asked to check the forklift and he proceeded to
check it.  "I found that the handbrake didn't work real well,
you could start
the vehicle in gear and a lot of safety panels weren't in place".  On an
incline of 1 in 20, with the handbrake on
and the forklift's gears in neutral,
the forklift rolled.  "We found... that you could start it up and within a
matter of seconds
it would move".
<P>

301  	The forklift could be started in gear, with the forward-reverse
lever in forward and the main gear lever in second.  
<P>

302  	"There was nowhere on the machine that told you what position
the gearstick was in on any of the levers".
<P>

303  	The following evidence was given:-
<P>

"Q.	On the day of delivery when you made your observations about starting the
forklift in gear, what was the length of time between
when you turned the
ignition key and the vehicle moving forward?
<P>

A.	In cold starting in relation to the vehicle, ten, five to ten seconds.  If
the vehicle was hot or operating, ten, five seconds
max.
<P>

Q.	Did you make any observations about the movement or travel in the
directional lever?
<P>

A.	Yes, the linkages were very worn and you could find a neutral position if
you really looked for it".
<P>

304  	There was no true neutral position on the directional lever
(that is the forward-reverse lever).
<P>

305  	The battery of the forklift was sitting on a step or foot
plate, close to the near side entrance to the driver's cabin.  A
cover for the
battery was fitted by Mr Morgan.  
<P>

306  	Although some modifications to the forklift were made by
Bowers, the positions of the two gear levers and the handbrake were
not
changed.  
<P>

307  	In late December 1996 Mr Morgan carried out work on the
forklift, including "fitting a switch to the clutch, so you couldn't
start the
vehicle, without having your foot on the clutch".  I allowed this evidence to
be given, not on the basis that it was evidence
of a design fault in the
forklift, but on the basis that it was evidence of a reasonably practicable
step which could be taken to
obviate the risk involved in the propensity of the
forklift to start in gear and, after a delay, to move forward.  Mr Morgan
added:-
<P>

"The switch was fitted underneath the clutch pedal so when your foot was on the
clutch it made a full circuit to the starter motor
to start the machine.  If
your foot was not on the clutch, the circuit was broken and there was no power
to the starter motor from
the key".
<P>

308  	The work of installing the switch was done at little cost by an
auto-electrician.
<P>

<b>Cross-examination</b>
<P>

309  	Mr Morgan was cross-examined by counsel for Skilled.  
<P>

310  	Mr Morgan said that he discovered that the forward-reverse
lever did not have a true neutral position; but that there was
"a false neutral
position", because of wear in the linkages.  It was possible to obtain what
appeared to be a neutral, when "what
in fact you were doing was operating the
lever in such a manner that ultimately it disengaged a gear".
<P>

311  	Mr Morgan was cross-examined by counsel for Malco.
<P>

312  	Mr Morgan said that the defect in the handbrake was mainly that
it was out of adjustment.
<P>

313  	As to the device he fitted to the forklift, Mr Morgan said:-
<P>

"It's only to prevent someone from starting the vehicle and not being on the
vehicle.  The forklift can't be started without having
your foot on the clutch
and pressing the clutch".
<P>

314  	Mr Morgan was cross-examined by counsel for Lift Truck Services
and Liftqip.
<P>

315  	Mr Morgan agreed that most of his work had been with machines
in the mining industry.  
<P>

316  	In testing the handbrake, he did not apply the footbrake and
the handbrake at the same time, although that should have been
done.
<P>

317  	Mr Morgan was cross-examined by counsel for the plaintiff.
<P>

318  	With regard to the forward-reverse gear, the following evidence
was given:-
<P>

"Q.	What you are saying, as I understand it, is that on the forward-reverse
lever in the Manitou there is no detent for neutral?
<P>

A.	Yes.
<P>

Q.	In other words, the manufacturer has not provided for any neutral
position?
<P>

A.	That's right, yes.
<P>

Q.	The reason you could find a neutral was because the linkages were so, there
was so much play in the linkages that between moving
the lever from one
position, one designed position to the next designed position, you could
actually get into a position where you
were in neither the first one, nor the
second one?
<P>

A.	Yes
<P>

Q.	And that was solely by reason of the poor condition of the box?
<P>

A.	Yes
<P>

Q.	Once you put the linkages into the condition they were meant to be in, you
move from one position on the box into another without
any neutral?
<P>

A.	Yes".
<P>

319  	The following evidence was also given:-
<P>

"Q.	But with the Manitou you could start it whilst it is in gear and despite
the fact that it was in gear it would not move forward?
<P>

A.	No.
<P>

Q.	It would not move forward until the hydraulic pressure had risen to a
certain state?
<P>

A.	Yes
<P>

Q.	The time taken to do that depended upon whether it was hot or cold?
<P>

A.	Yes
<P>

Q.	If it was cold, I think you say a ten seconds plus?
<P>

A.	Yes
<P>

Q.	If it was hot, it would perhaps move in five seconds or so?
<P>

A.	Yes, five seconds maximum.
<P>

Q.	Was there this definite gap between the turning the key, starting the motor,
the vehicle stationary and then without any warning
it would begin to move
forward?
<P>

A.	Yes".
<P>

320  	Mr Morgan said "you would have to give it a fair bump to move
it" out of the false neutral position.  
<P>

321  	Mr Morgan said that the handbrake was virtually not working at
all.
<P>

<b>Mr Caddy</b>
<P>

<b>Evidence in Chief</b>
<P>

322  	Mr Robert Caddy gave evidence that up until February 1996 he
had been the managing director of Syd-Fam.  Syd-Fam carried on
the business of
a truss plant and a timberyard at Yarrawonga on the Murray River, about one
hours drive west of Albury.
<P>

323  	In about 1993 (Mr Caddy originally said 1995) he came to an
arrangement with Mr Drage, whose company Lift Truck Services had
been servicing
Syd-Fam's existing forklift, to trade in the existing forklift and acquire for
Syd-Fam a Manitou forklift.  A Manitou
forklift, which was the forklift which
injured the plaintiff, was delivered to Yarrawonga.  It was registered as a
motor vehicle
under Victorian legislation in the name of "Caddy's Timber and
Hardware", that is Syd-Fam.
<P>

324  	In mid 1995 the forklift was "inoperational".  "The machine
engine was in running order but to engage it in gear would not
result in any
forward or reverse movement of the vehicle".  The forklift was taken by Lift
Truck Services to its premises at Albury.
 Mr Drage gave Mr Caddy an estimate
of the cost of repairing the forklift.  Mr Caddy considered that it was not
worth spending that
amount of money on the forklift.  
<P>

325  	An arrangement was made between Mr Caddy and Mr Drage for Mr
Drage's company to repair the forklift, sell it, deduct the cost
of repairs and
pay Mr Caddy the balance.  
<P>

326  	Mr Drage said nothing to Mr Caddy about hiring out the
forklift, Mr Caddy did not consent to the forklift being hired out
and Syd-Fam
did not receive any money from the hiring out of the forklift.
<P>

327  	Mr Caddy did not remember the forklift having a problem with
water in the oil, at the time it was last taken from Yarrawonga.
<P>

328  	In January 1996 Mr Drage telephoned Mr Caddy.  Mr Drage said
"not only was the forklift a problem for you, it has been a problem
for someone
else.  A chap has been nearly killed by the forklift.  He has been run over".
In the conversation Mr Drage said that
he had found a buyer for the
forklift.
<P>

329  	Syd-Fam surrendered the plates to the forklift.  On 31 January
1996 Syd-Fam deposited in its bank account $13,000, which it
had received from
Lift Truck Services from the sale of the forklift.  
<P>

<b>Cross-examination </b>
<P>

330  	Mr Caddy was cross-examined by counsel for Lift Truck Services
and Liftqip.  
<P>

331  	Mr Caddy said that the forklift, while it was with Syd-Fam, was
"a constant frustration, with numerous problems".
<P>

332  	Mr Caddy had first been asked to recall what had happened
concerning the forklift, in late 1997.  Mr Caddy had made a statement,
which
bore a date in May 1998.  Mr Caddy had in fact received a draft of the
statement some time earlier.  He had sought advice from
Syd-Fam's usual
solicitors, before making a signed statement.  The signed statement had not
been forwarded to the solicitors acting
for Syd-Fam in the current proceedings,
until March 1999.  In preparing the statement Mr Caddy had not had recourse to
any documents
and had relied simply on his memory.  Mr Caddy had ceased his
association with Syd-Fam in February 1996 and had not sought to look
for any
records of Syd-Fam.
<P>

333  	Mr Caddy conceded that he did not have any mechanical knowledge
and was not sure what was wrong with the forklift, when it
left Syd-Fam's
premises for the last time.  However, he knew that the forklift was
inoperative.
<P>

334  	Mr Caddy denied that on the last occasion the forklift was
taken from Syd-Fam's premises, it was taken for repairs to the
engine because
of water coming into the oil in the engine.
<P>

335  	Mr Caddy said that he would not have consented to Mr Drage
hiring out the forklift, because "I still perceived it was my machine
and I
also believed if we had entered into an agreement of that type it would delay
(a) sale".  Mr Caddy conceded that he had had
no
<P>

336      experience in selling forklifts and conceded, as is obvious, that Mr
Drage was experienced in selling forklifts.
<P>

<b>Mr Collins</b>
<P>

<b>Evidence in Chief</b>
<P>

337  	Mr Collins gave evidence that he was a fitter/welder employed
by Lift Truck Services for the last fourteen years.  In the
course of his
employment he had worked on forklifts.  
<P>

338  	On 18 July 1995 Mr Collins checked the handbrake, footbrake and
clutch of the forklift and adjusted the clutch.  
<P>

339  	Mr Collins gave evidence about the work sheets which were used
by Lift Truck Services.  The form of work sheet used had spaces
for particulars
of the job being done and parts headed "points to be serviced" with twenty-six
listed items, each with a box alongside
it, "repairs carried out", "repairs
required", "spare parts required" and "oils used".  
<P>

340  	Mr Collins distinguished between doing a service on a forklift
and doing repairs to a forklift.  If a service was being done,
entries were
made in the boxes under the heading "points to be serviced".
<P>

341  	Mr Collins recalled "refitting the cylinder head and the sump
and the steering axle" of the forklift between August and October
1995.  He
said that the forklift was never "pulled apart".  In the period leading up to
the forklift going to the ANM Mill, Mr Collins
did not do any work on the gear
box, transmission, clutch or brakes. 
<P>

342  	Before the forklift went out to the Mill Mr Collins on 31
October road tested it to make sure that there was no water leaking
into the
sump.  After the road test he checked that the oil in the sump was at the same
level.  
<P>

343  	In testing the forklift Mr Collins found nothing wrong with the
gears or the brakes.  After he had completed testing the forklift,
he saw Mr
Drage come out and test the forklift.
<P>

344  	Mr Collins said he knew nothing about the hiring of the
forklift.  On 31 October he thought that the forklift was going back
to
Caddy's.  
<P>

345  	Mr Collins and Mr Drage went out to the Mill, after the
accident had happened.  Mr Collins did not himself test the forklift
at the
Mill.  However, Mr Drage tested the forklift.  (He) "tried the handbrake and
the footbrake, tried to take off with the engine
in gear and with the handbrake
and everything on".  
<P>

346  	Mr Collins subsequently went out to the Mill and picked up the
forklift.  The forklift was winched on to Lift Truck Services'
truck.  Mr
Collins had to start the forklift to get it to the truck and then steer the
forklift, as it was being winched on to the
truck.  Mr Collins did not notice
anything wrong with the gears, the clutch or the brakes.  When the forklift
arrived at the premises
of Lift Truck Services, Mr Collins unloaded it.  In
unloading the forklift he had to drive the forklift.  He tested the
handbrake.
<P>

347  	Counsel for Lift Truck Services and Liftqip took Mr Collins
through the last work sheets in October 1995.  On the work sheet
dated 24
October 1995 (work sheet No. 5070) there were no repairs to any of the
transmission, the gear boxes or the clutch.  Subsequent
work sheets indicated
that the engine was being assembled.
<P>

348  	Mr Collins had never seen a switch fitted to a Manitou
forklift, such that the clutch would have to be depressed before the
forklift
could be started.
<P>

<b>Cross-examination</b>
<P>

349  	Mr Collins was cross-examined by counsel for Syd-Fam. 
<P>

350  	The first time Mr Collins know that he might be required to
give evidence was in November 1998, when the first part of the
hearing was
taking place.
<P>

351  	Mr Collins denied that at any time between November 1995 and
November 1998 he had talked to Mr Drage about the accident. 
On average, he
would have seen Mr Drage every two or three days.
<P>

352  	Between November 1995 and November 1998 Mr Collins put the
matter of the forklift completely out of his mind, although "I
didn't forget
all about it".
<P>

353  	Mr Collins said that he understood that the reason why he was
asked to go to the Mill on 6 November 1995 was to assist with
jump starting the
forklift.  He did not have any discussion with Mr Drage before going out to the
Mill.
<P>

354  	Mr Collins had never tried to start the forklift while it was
in one of the forward gears.  
<P>

355  	Mr Collins doubted whether there was any such thing as "chief
mechanic" at Lift Truck Services but of the mechanics at Lift
Truck Services he
had been there the longest.
<P>

356  	The problems being rectified in October 1995 were water getting
into the engine oil, the steering being "a bit hard" and the
replacing of the
seals in the steering cylinder.  When Mr Collins first saw the forklift, the
engine was "pulled apart", "in pieces".
<P>

357  	Mr Collins did not see anyone from Prevwreck (that is, Mr
Harders) arrive at Lift Truck Services' premises to collect the
forklift.  
<P>

358  	Work sheet 5070 dated 24 October 1995 recorded work done by Mr
Collins.  Under the heading "repairs carried out" he wrote
"pick up gaskets and
cylinder head and pistons.  Clean bottom O-ring groove, fit cylinder lines".
Work sheet 5071 dated 25 October
1995 was completed by Mr Collins.  Mr Collins
wrote on the work sheet "start to assemble machine".  The 27 and 28 October
1995 were
a week-end.  On work sheet 5072 dated 30 October 1995 Mr Collins
wrote "assemble engine and refit steering axle".  Mr Collins was
still in the
course of assembling the engine, when he completed work that day (30 October
1995).
<P>

359  	On work sheet 5073 dated 31 October 1995 Mr Collins wrote
"finish off truck top up oils and test" and he ticked the box "job
complete".
The job was not completed until 1.30 in the afternoon.  Mr Collins did his
testing of the forklift "probably between 12
and 1.30".
<P>

360  	Mr Collins said that he did not wear overalls and he did not
think that Mr Drage wore overalls.
<P>

361  	Mr Collins did not have any conversation with anyone not
employed by Lift Truck Services, when the forklift was taken away
on hire on 31
October.
<P>

362  	Mr Collins denied that he had written the word "fair" in the
condition report on the Hire Agreement from Liftqip to Prevwreck.
 Mr Collins
said that in his understanding workshop "fair" meant "everything works but it's
not a new machine";  office "fair" usually
meant the outside appearance of the
unit.
<P>

363  	Mr Collins did not recall Mr Drage asking him on 31 October to
test the forklift.  After Mr Collins had tested the forklift
Mr Drage said that
he would test the forklift.  Mr Collins told Mr Drage that he, Mr Collins, had
already tested the forklift.
<P>

364  	Mr Collins was cross-examined by counsel for Malco.
<P>

365  	Mr Collins said that he had not filled out the Liftqip Hire
Agreement.  
<P>

366  	He denied that in October 1995 he had been in a great hurry to
get the job on the forklift finished.
<P>

367  	Mr Collins was cross-examined about various Lift Truck
Services' work sheets.  The work sheets dated as of August 1995 were
directed
in part to resolving the problem of water in the engine oil.  On work sheet
4652 dated 8 August 1995 the repairs carried
out were noted as "TTS,
investigate water in the engine oil, remove head inspect &amp; RTB with the
head for crack test flatness
check injector tube seal check".  On work sheet
4678 dated 24 and 25 August 1995 "repairs carried out" were noted as "unload
from
truck. Steam clean.  Remove weights radiator steer axle sump piston and
liners and inspect.  Clean work area".
<P>

368  	Mr Collins did not recall ever telephoning Mr Drage from
Yarrawonga to discuss the amount which would be charged by Lift Truck
Services
for repairs to the forklift.
<P>

369  	Mr Caddy did not tell Mr Collins and no one on behalf of Mr
Caddy told Mr Collins that there were clutch and gear problems
with the
forklift in 1995.
<P>

370  	On 6 November 1995 at the Mill Mr Collins had not talked to
anyone about the forklift.  
<P>

371  	Mr Collins said that he had never done any repairs to the gears
of the forklift.
<P>

372  	Mr Collins said that when he tested the forklift on 31 October
he drove the forklift about ten kilometres on public roads.
 He did not take
any oil or water with him.  He drove the forklift up a hill to make sure the
forklift got hot.  When the forklift
got hot, it was possible to tell whether
there was an oil or water leak.
<P>

373  	Mr Collins was cross-examined by counsel for the plaintiff.
<P>

374  	Mr Collins denied that he knew on 6 November 1995 that it had
been at least suggested that the forklift might have contributed
to the
accident.
<P>

375  	Mr Collins said that on 6 November at the Mill Mr Drage had
tested the forklift.  Mr Drage was "driving it around... I was
probably about
eighty metres away inside the factory".  Mr Collins said that he was shown by
persons the path the forklift had allegedly
followed on 4 November, for fifty
to sixty metres from outside the building into the building.  When it was put
to Mr Collins that
there was some inconsistency in the evidence he had given
about whether he had seen Mr Drage do any tests on the forklift at the
Mill, he
said, "I was there for a while and then I was taken away.  I seen Mr Drage do
these tests and then I didn't see any more,
I was taken into the factory".  Mr
Collins did not ask Mr Drage why Mr Drage was doing the tests.  
<P>

376  	When he was at the Mill on 6 November Mr Collins knew that
someone had been injured within a few days of his assembling the
forklift and
he accepted that he would have had some interest in finding out how the
accident had happened but he had done nothing
to find out how the accident had
happened.
<P>

377  	Mr Collins said that there was nothing wrong with the brakes or
gears (either the forward-reverse or the main gear) of the
forklift, when it
left Mr Collins on 31 October.
<P>

378  	Mr Collins said that, so far as he could recall, there was a
neutral position on the forward-reverse lever.
<P>

379  	Mr Collins said that the gear positions for the main gear lever
were clearly marked on the top of the housing and that there
was no sloppiness
or difficulty in getting the gear lever into each of the gears.
<P>

380  	He said that he was walking away, but only a few metres away,
when on 6 November he saw Mr Drage performing the tests on the
forklift,
including checking the handbrake. "What I seen (of the tests) was probably
about five minutes".  Mr Collins did not subsequently
ask Mr Drage what his
tests of the forklift had disclosed.
<P>

381  	As far as Mr Collins was concerned, the work he was performing
on the forklift in late October 1995 was a routine job not
involving any
urgency.  No one told him the forklift had to be ready by 30 October.
<P>

<b>Credibility of some of the witnesses</b>
<P>

382  	After this survey of some of the evidence given by the
witnesses, it is appropriate that I make some observations about what
I
consider to be the credibility of some of the witnesses.
<P>

383  	I am prepared, for the most part, to accept the plaintiff's
evidence, although the plaintiff was by no means a fully reliable
witness.   I
will give a few examples of evidence given by the plaintiff which I consider to
be unreliable.  I am satisfied that
the plaintiff marked the position of the
battery on the forklift incorrectly, in a position some distance above the foot
plate, where
it would be necessary to lift a panel to reach the battery.
Although I am satisfied that there was a delay between Mr Onody switching
the
ignition of the forklift on and the forklift commencing to move forward, I am
satisfied, in the light of other evidence including
Mr Morgan's, that the delay
was not as long as the plaintiff estimated.  The plaintiff said that at the
time of the accident there
was a noisy machine operating in the vicinity, the
noise of which would have drowned the sound of the forklift's engine.  This
evidence
by the plaintiff is contradicted by the evidence of both Mr Dyson and
Mr Onody, whose evidence is supported by the circumstance that
it was a
Saturday afternoon and by the evidence generally, which would suggest that
there was no other person or activity in the
vicinity.
<P>

384  	There are also some puzzling features of the plaintiff's
evidence.  For example, if the plaintiff was actually holding the
end of a lead
to a terminal of the battery of the forklift, it is surprising that he should
not have noticed that the forklift was
moving, before the forklift ran over his
foot.
<P>

385  	The plaintiff's case against the defendants was put by his
counsel on the basis that the plaintiff was mistaken in his belief
that he had
put both the main gear and the forward-reverse gear into neutral, when he
parked the forklift.
<P>

386  	I consider that Mr Dyson was an honest but not always reliable
witness.  Unsurprisingly, he did not recall some things which
I am satisfied
happened.  In some cases his recollection was faulty.  For example, he thought
that stage two of the job at the Mill
had been in progress for two or three
weeks before the plaintiff was injured.  When there is a conflict between the
plaintiff's evidence
and Mr Dyson's evidence, for example, about whether the
plaintiff complained to Mr Dyson about the forklift, I would generally,
although
not always, prefer the plaintiff's evidence.  I generally accept the
evidence of Mr Onody.
<P>

387  	A witness whose credibility was strongly attacked was Mr
Harders.  It was submitted by a number of counsel that I should not
accept Mr
Harders' evidence of what he said had happened when he delivered the forklift
to the ANM Mill.  However, some of the same
counsel suggested that I should
accept his account of what he said had happened, when he picked up the forklift
at the premises of
Lift Truck Services.  
<P>

388  	I do not accept Mr Harders' evidence about what he said
happened when he delivered the forklift to the ANM Mill, where his
evidence is
in conflict with other evidence.  His account is contradicted in important
respects by the evidence of all of the plaintiff,
Mr Dyson and Mr Onody.  It is
unlikely that Mr Dyson was already "there", waiting for the delivery of the
forklift, when Mr Harders
arrived at the Mill.  It is unlikely that Mr Harders
would have asked "all present" (whether they were three or four individuals),
if they each had a forklift ticket or that everyone present said or nodded
"yes". If Mr Dyson and Mr Onody had been asked whether
they had a forklift
ticket, I consider that each of them would have replied, truthfully, in the
negative.  If "all present" (all
of whom would have been considerably older
than Mr Harders) had indicated that they had a forklift ticket, then it is
unlikely that
Mr Harders would have given them the kind of stilted lecture
about how to operate a forklift which Mr Harders alleged that he gave.
 It is
unlikely, in any event, that Mr Harders would have given such a lecture.
<P>

389  	It is true that I can, if I see fit, reject part of the
evidence of a witness and accept some other part of the evidence of
the same
witness.  However, I should not do this capriciously and, having rejected Mr
Harders' evidence about what happened when
he delivered the forklift at the
Mill, I do not consider that I should accept his evidence about what happened
when he picked up
the forklift at the premises of Lift Truck Services, where it
is contradicted by the evidence of Mr Drage or Mr Collins.  Mr Harders'
demeanour generally was unimpressive.  He obviously resented having to attend
court to give evidence and resented the fact that complaints
had been made
about a forklift he had delivered.
<P>

390  	A witness whose credibility is important to at least one of the
cross-claims is Mr Moore, the supply manager employed by Malco.
 After being
extremely positive and categorical in his evidence in chief concerning what he
said was the invariable practice followed
in the placing of orders by Malco, Mr
Moore had to retract much of his evidence in cross-examination.  I formed an
unfavourable view
of Mr Moore's credibility generally.
<P>

391  	The two witnesses who were called late in the hearing by
Syd-Fam, Mr Morgan and Mr Caddy, became important witnesses.  
<P>

392  	I found Mr Morgan an impressive witness.  It is true that his
first contact with the forklift was not until December 1996,
just over a year
after the accident, and this lapse of time must be taken into account in
assessing his evidence.  However, it would
be remarkable, if it were merely a
coincidence that defects, similar to those which the plaintiff claimed to have
observed in the
forklift in November 1995, were also observed by Mr Morgan in
December 1996.
<P>

393  	Mr Morgan's evidence, that there was no true neutral position
for the forward-reverse lever but only a "false" neutral, came
as a surprise,
as being inconsistent with some other evidence in the case.  However, I am
disposed to accept Mr Morgan's evidence
on this point.
<P>

394  	Mr Caddy had first been asked to recall what had happened in
late 1997, had had no recourse to contemporaneous documents and
had had simply
to rely on his memory in preparing the statement he made and in giving his
evidence.
<P>

395  	Mr Caddy was not a fully reliable witness.  For example, he did
not remember, and was inclined to deny, that the forklift
had had a problem
with water getting into the oil at the time the forklift was taken from
Yarrawonga for the last time in August
1995.  However, contemporaneous Lift
Truck Services' work sheets indicate that this was a problem with the forklift
in August 1995.
<P>

396  	I have, however, decided that I should generally accept Mr
Caddy's evidence.  It is true that he did not have any special
mechanical
knowledge.  However, no special mechanical knowledge is really required to know
that a forklift is "inoperational" or
that, even though a forklift is put in
gear, there is no forward or reverse movement of the forklift.
<P>

397  	A strong attack was mounted, particularly by counsel for the
plaintiff and counsel for Malco, on the credibility of Mr Drage.
 
<P>

398  	I would not find, as I was urged to do, that Mr Drage was
consciously dishonest in any of his evidence.  However, I am satisfied
that in
a number of respects his evidence was inaccurate and this inaccuracy has an
effect on the reliability of his evidence generally.
 For example, Mr Drage
said that the forklift shown in exhibit "M" was "similar" to, "identical" with,
the forklift which injured
the plaintiff but then had to concede that the two
forklifts were different in a number of respects.  Mr Drage said that the word
"fair" had been written in the condition report in the hire agreement from
Liftqip to Prevwreck by Mr Collins, with whose handwriting
he would have been
familiar.  Later, Mr Drage resiled to some extent from this evidence and Mr
Collins, when he gave evidence, denied
that he had written the word "fair".
<P>

399  	Mr Drage denied that the forward-reverse gear was operated by
hydraulic power.  He said that he remembered distinctly that
the
forward-reverse gear used to grind, if the operator did not put his foot on the
clutch.  Yet elsewhere in his evidence he said
that a problem which the
forklift had had some years before the accident was due to a pipe providing
hydraulic pressure to the forward-reverse
gear having split.  That the
forward-reverse gear was operated by hydraulic power was, in my opinion,
established conclusively by
other evidence in the case.
<P>

400  	Mr Drage said that Mr Caddy had not given his consent to the
particular hiring of the forklift to Prevwreck but asserted that
Mr Caddy had
given a general consent to the forklift being hired.  I accept Mr Caddy's
evidence that no such consent was given by
him.  
<P>

401  	Mr Drage could not see how it could have happened, that the
forklift, having been started, should, after a delay of some seconds,
have
moved forward.  I am satisfied that this is what in fact happened with the
forklift.
<P>

402  	Mr Drage conceded that it was possible that he had had a
conversation with Mr Caddy in January 1996 along the lines alleged
by Mr Caddy,
that is that he had told Mr Caddy that the forklift had been a problem, not
only for Mr Caddy's company, but for someone
else as well and that the forklift
had nearly killed a man by running over him.
<P>

403  	A serious attack was also mounted on the credibility of Mr
Collins.  
<P>

404  	There are a number of matters which cast doubt on the
reliability of Mr Collins' evidence.  Mr Collins first knew that he
might be
required to give evidence in November 1998 during the first part of the
hearing, that is three years after the accident.
 Mr Collins, who was working
on the forklift on 30 and 31 October 1995, denied that there was any urgency in
doing this work.  I
find this difficult to accept, as I am satisfied that
Liftqip had agreed to hire out the forklift as from midday on 30 October.
<P>

405  	I accept that Mr Collins gave the forklift a test on 31
October.  However, according to his own evidence, the main purpose
of this test
was to determine whether the forklift had any oil or water leak.
<P>

406  	Mr Collins accompanied Mr Drage to the ANM Mill on 6 November.
Mr Collins knew that someone had been injured in an accident
involving the
forklift, within a few days of his having assembled the forklift.  I do not
accept that, in those circumstances, he
would have done nothing to find out how
the accident had happened.  
<P>

407  	Mr Collins' evidence about where he said he was, when he
claimed to have seen Mr Drage testing the forklift at the Mill varied
considerably from time to time in his evidence.  Mr Collins asserted that he
saw Mr Drage test the forklift on 6 November, by trying
to turn the engine on
with the gears engaged and the handbrake on.  Mr Drage, on the other hand, said
that he had not performed any
such test on 6 November.  Mr Collins asserted
that after Mr Drage had performed tests on the forklift on 6 November, he had
not asked
Mr Drage why he had done the tests or what the tests had disclosed.
I do not accept this evidence.
<P>

408  	Mr Collins asserted that the gear positions were clearly marked
on the top of the housing.  I am satisfied that this evidence
is incorrect.
<P>

<b>Other difficulties in Fact Finding</b>
<P>

409  	Apart from shortcomings in the credibility of some of the
witnesses, there are other difficulties in determining what was
the state of
the forklift at the time the accident happened and how the accident happened.

<P>

410  	It is unfortunate that there was no proper independent
inspection of the forklift soon after the accident happened or at least
none of
which evidence was given at the hearing of these proceedings.  The report of
the accident investigation team of ANM was primarily
concerned with whether
there had been any deficiencies in the procedures of ANM itself.  The only real
expert engineering evidence
given at the hearing was that given in his reports
and orally by Mr Anderson.  Mr Anderson concluded that there was not sufficient
data to determine what caused the forklift to commence moving forward some time
after the engine started.  Mr Anderson lamented that
he had not himself seen
the forklift.  Mr Pitcher, the Workcover inspector who went to the ANM Mill on
6 November 1995 to investigate
the accident, was not called as a witness by any
party.  The reports by experts retained by Lift Truck Services and Liftqip and
by
Syd-Fam, which other evidence clearly disclosed existed, were not tendered
by any party at the hearing.
<P>

411  	Because of the complexity of the matter and because many
aspects remain obscure, I do not consider that I should give myself
a <b>Jones
v Dunkel</b> direction in respect of any person not called as a witness.
<P>

<b>Findings</b>
<P>

412  	It is necessary for me to make some explicit findings about the
nature of the forklift and its condition at the time of the
accident and about
the way in which the accident happened.
<P>

413  	The nature of the forklift is described in some of the evidence
which I have already summarised.  
<P>

414  	The forklift was a diesel powered forklift.  It had four speed
manual transmission gears and a separate forward-reverse gear.
 For the
forklift to move forward, the main gears would have to be in gear and the
forward-reverse gear would have to be in forward.
  
<P>

415  	The forward-reverse gear was hydraulically operated.  When Mr
Morgan examined the forklift, there was no true neutral but
because of worn
linkages the gear lever could be moved into a position where the
forward-reverse gear was disengaged.  The forward-reverse
gear was operated by
a floor mounted lever on the left hand side of the driver.
<P>

416  	The main gears were "sloppy", making it difficult for the
operator to tell whether he had put the main gears into neutral.
 There were no
visible markings on the gear lever indicating the positions the gear lever
should be moved to in order to engage the
various gears.  The gear lever for
the main gears was relatively low to the floor and the plaintiff drove the
forklift with the gear
lever between his legs.  
<P>

417  	The handbrake was not functioning properly and was
ergonomically awkward, that is it was physically difficult for the operator
to
move the handbrake into a position where it was fully applied.  The handbrake
was operated by a floor mounted lever, close to
the forward-reverse gear lever.
If the handbrake had been properly maintained and had been applied properly,
then it should have
held the forklift, even though the engine was running, the
main gears were in gear and the forward-reverse gear was in forward.
<P>

418  	The battery was situated in an open position on a foot plate on
the side of the forklift.  The battery was not in the position
which the
plaintiff marked on a photograph of the forklift as being the position of the
battery.  But nor was the battery in the
same position as the battery of the
forklift shown in exhibit "M" (as Mr Drage alleged).  
<P>

419  	The ignition switch was on the right hand side of the dashboard
underneath the steering wheel.  As the forklift had a diesel
engine, the engine
could not be stopped immediately by switching off the ignition.  The forklift
engine could be stopped immediately
by applying a kill switch, situated on the
right hand side of the cabin about level with the driver.
<P>

420  	The forklift could be started "with the drive train engaged",
that is with the main gears in gear and the forward-reverse
gear in forward.
The forklift was not fitted with any device which would prevent the engine
being started in gear but such a device
is not normally found in a forklift
with a manual transmission.  
<P>

421  	If the forklift was started in gear, it could happen that the
forklift would not move forward immediately but would then,
after a delay of
several seconds, start moving forward.
<P>

422  	When the forklift was taken from Syd-Fam's premises to Lift
Truck Services' premises in August 1995, it was "inoperational"
and the gears
were causing problems.  The forklift was taken to Lift Truck Services' premises
pursuant to an arrangement made between
Mr Caddy and Mr Drage that Mr Drage's
company would repair the forklift and sell the forklift, accounting to Mr
Caddy's company for
the net proceeds of sale.  Mr Caddy did not consent to the
forklift being hired out.  
<P>

423  	Between August and October 1995 various repairs were done to
the forklift.  The extant contemporaneous documents do not clearly
disclose all
of the work done.  According to Mr Collins' evidence, no work was done on the
gear box, the transmission, the clutch
or the brakes but I am not satisfied
that this is correct.
<P>

424  	I consider that I should hold that the various tests performed
by Mr Collins and Mr Drage were of a limited nature only. 
The main purpose of
the tests performed by Mr Collins on 31 October, according to his own evidence,
was to make sure that no water
was leaking into the sump.  The testing of the
forklift by Mr Drage on 31 October was limited to driving the forklift around
the
premises of Lift Truck Services.  Mr Drage knew that his "senior mechanic"
Mr Collins had already driven the forklift  that day and
Liftqip was already a
day late in supplying the forklift.  These factors would suggest that any
driving of the forklift by Mr Drage
on 31 October was fairly cursory.  Mr
Harders, when he picked up and delivered the forklift on 31 October, drove it
only short distances
in loading it on to a truck and then unloading it from the
truck.  Mr Collins did not himself test the forklift on 6 November.  On
6
November Mr Drage performed certain operations on the forklift under the
direction of a Workcover inspector.  However, he did not
perform the test of
starting the forklift with the drive train engaged and the handbrake
applied.
<P>

425  	I am satisfied that I should accept the plaintiff's evidence
that he complained to Mr Dyson about the forklift, as he alleged
in his
evidence.  The plaintiff's evidence is partly corroborated by Mr Onody's
evidence that the plaintiff had some "grizzles" about
the forklift and in
particular had complained about the gears.  Mr Dyson denied that the plaintiff
had complained about the forklift
but qualified this denial to some extent by
saying that the plaintiff had said that it was an old, manual forklift and by
agreeing
that it was possible that he had told the plaintiff that Prevwreck had
said that the forklift was the only forklift available.
<P>

426  	Before making findings about what happened at and about the
time of the accident, I should note that the plaintiff was a qualified,
experienced forklift driver, whereas neither Mr Dyson nor Mr Onody had any
qualification or any experience in driving forklifts.
 The plaintiff was the
only one of the three who had driven this particular forklift, after it had
been delivered to the Mill.  
<P>

427  	On 4 November 1995 Mr Dyson asked the plaintiff to use a
ladder, which was part of Malco's equipment.  The plaintiff declined
on the
ground that the ladder was dangerous.  Mr Dyson thereupon asked the plaintiff
to get some kind of substitute for the ladder.
 The plaintiff obtained the boom
lift, which did not belong to Malco but which was on the site.  Mr Dyson
acquiesced in the use of
the boom lift and himself used the boom lift to fix
bolts in the overhead gantry Malco was erecting.
<P>

428  	After the boom lift had been used and had been switched off,
difficulty was experienced in restarting the boom lift.  It was
necessary to
restart the boom lift, either to lower the boom (according to the plaintiff's
evidence) or to return the boom lift to
where it had been taken from (according
to Mr Dyson's evidence).  A decision was made by the group to endeavour to
restart the boom
lift by jump starting it, using the forklift.  Although the
decision was one in which all three members of the group participated,
effectively the decision was made by the person in charge of the group, Mr
Dyson.  
<P>

429  	The plaintiff drove the forklift and parked it close to, and
parallel with, the boom lift, so that the nearside of the forklift
was adjacent
to the offside of the boom lift.  It is unclear how far the two vehicles were
apart.  The plaintiff said that they were
very close together and that it was
not possible to walk between the two vehicles.  Mr Dyson said that the two
vehicles were about
a metre apart and Mr Onody said that they were at least a
few feet apart.  I consider that it is likely, having regard to evidence
about
the movements of the plaintiff and Mr Onody in the space between the two
vehicles, that the two vehicles were further apart
than the plaintiff said.

<P>

430  	The plaintiff gave evidence in a number of parts of his
evidence about the procedure he followed on this occasion and the
procedure he
followed on all occasions in stopping and parking the forklift.  I accept that
on this occasion the plaintiff lowered
the tines of the forklift, applied the
handbrake and turned the engine off by using the kill switch.  The plaintiff
also said that
he made sure that the forklift was out of gear.  He said that
the procedure he always followed was to put the main gear lever into
the
neutral position using the clutch, then take his foot off the clutch and then
move the forward-reverse lever to the neutral position.
 He said that he did
these things, before applying the handbrake and turning the engine off.  
<P>

431  	I am satisfied that the plaintiff in fact left the forklift in
gear, that is the main gear lever in gear and the forward-reverse
gear lever in
forward.  Indeed, it was the plaintiff's case, as put by his counsel, that the
plaintiff was mistaken in thinking that
he had put the forklift out of gear
into neutral.  
<P>

432  	The forklift could not move forward, unless the main gear was
in gear and the forward-reverse gear was in forward.  For reasons
which I give
below, I am satisfied that the gear levers were not moved into gear by Mr Onody
and I am also satisfied that the gear
levers were not moved into gear by
vibration of the engine of the forklift after it had been started by Mr Onody.
I reject evidence
by Mr Drage that the forklift could not be started with the
two gears in gear and the handbrake applied.  
<P>

433  	After parking the forklift, the plaintiff got out of the
forklift.  He stood in between the two vehicles, facing the forklift
with his
back to the boom lift.  The plaintiff was standing in between the front and the
rear wheels of the forklift.
<P>

434  	Mr Onody got a pair of leads from Malco's equipment container.
The leads were welding leads about twenty feet long.  The leads
were
successfully applied by the plaintiff and Mr Onody to the battery of the boom
lift.  The plaintiff then endeavoured to apply
the leads to the battery of the
forklift.  
<P>

435  	The plaintiff asked Mr Onody to start the forklift.  I am
satisfied that the plaintiff also said to Mr Onody "it (the forklift)
won't
move".  Mr Onody said that the plaintiff said this and the plaintiff accepted
that he might have said this to Mr Onody.  The
confidence the plaintiff
undoubtedly had that the forklift would not move tends to suggest that it quite
likely that the plaintiff
would have told Mr Onody that the forklift would not
move.
<P>

436  	Apart from telling Mr Onody to start the forklift and that the
forklift would not move, the plaintiff did not say anything
to Mr Onody.  In
particular, the plaintiff did not tell Mr Onody to get into the driver's seat
of the forklift to start the forklift
or to stay in or near the forklift.  
<P>

437  	After being told by the plaintiff to start the forklift, Mr
Onody got on to the foot plate of the forklift and, without otherwise
entering
into the cabin of the forklift, reached across the cabin with his arm and
started the forklift by turning the ignition key.
 I am satisfied that Mr Onody
got on to the foot plate on the left hand side (that is the nearside) of the
forklift.  Mr Onody said
that he got on to the left hand side foot plate.  The
plaintiff initially said the same in his evidence, although later in his
evidence
he said that Mr Onody could have got on to the other side of the
forklift.  If Mr Onody was standing on the foot plate on the left
hand side of
the forklift, he had to reach across a distance of about two and a half to
three feet to turn the ignition key, situated
as it was towards the right hand
side of the dashboard.  
<P>

438  	At the time Mr Onody started the forklift, Mr Dyson was
standing somewhere near the rear of the forklift.
<P>

439  	I am satisfied that, neither in reaching across the cabin to
turn the ignition key nor in withdrawing his arm, did Mr Onody
touch any of the
two gear levers or the handbrake.  Mr Onody denied that he touched any of these
controls of the forklift.  I consider
it is unlikely that he touched any of
them inadvertently.  The ignition of the forklift is on the dashboard.  The
main gear lever
is quite low to the floor of the cabin of the forklift.  The
handbrake and the forward-reverse gear lever are towards the rear of
the cabin
on the left hand side of the driver.  
<P>

440  	After Mr Onody turned on the ignition of the forklift, the
plaintiff found that the clamp he was using to try to secure one
of the leads
to a terminal of the battery of the forklift was ineffective.  The plaintiff
could not recall whether he asked Mr Onody
to get another clamp or whether Mr
Onody volunteered to get another clamp.  I consider it likely that the
plaintiff asked Mr Onody
to get another clamp.  Of the two of them, the
plaintiff was the one who would have been more conscious of the inadequacy of
the
clamp he was attempting to use and the plaintiff was the one who was really
in control of the operation.  
<P>

441  	Mr Onody went away from the forklift to get another clamp.  The
plaintiff continued to hold the lead and the clamp to the
terminal. After some
delay the forklift moved slowly forward, trapping the plaintiff's right leg.
The forklift had moved less than
a metre, when it trapped the plaintiff's right
leg.  
<P>

442  	As previously noted, in order for the forklift to move forward
the forward-reverse gear must have been in forward and the
main gear lever must
have been in gear, probably a low gear.  If the handbrake had been functioning
properly and had been properly
applied, it should have stopped the forklift
moving, even though the engine was running and both gear levers were in
gear.
<P>

443  	I am satisfied that there was a delay between Mr Onody starting
the engine and the forklift moving forward.  All of the plaintiff,
Mr Dyson and
Mr Onody said that there was such a delay.  However, they differed in their
estimates of the length of the delay.  The
plaintiff said twenty to thirty
seconds and denied that the delay could have been as short as ten seconds.  Mr
Dyson said between
ten and twenty seconds.  Mr Onody said half a minute to a
minute.
<P>

444  	I consider it unlikely that the delay was as long as some of
these estimates.  Estimates of time are notoriously inaccurate.
 However, as I
have said, there was a perceptible delay lasting at least some seconds, during
which the plaintiff observed that the
clamp he was using was inadequate, the
plaintiff asked Mr Onody to get another clamp and Mr Onody walked some distance
away from
the forklift to get another clamp.
<P>

445  	After the plaintiff's foot was trapped and he called out, Mr
Onody tried to stop the forklift by running to the forklift,
jumping on to the
left hand side foot plate and turning the ignition key.  However, the forklift
did not stop.  The forklift had
a diesel engine, which could not be stopped
immediately by turning off the ignition.  Mr Dyson then jumped on to the foot
plate on
the right hand side of the forklift and, after some delay, pushed the
kill switch, thereby stopping the forklift.  
<P>

<b>Claims in the Proceedings</b>
<P>

446  	I now turn to the various claims made in the proceedings.   As
I have already said, I do not propose in the present judgment
to attempt to
decide all of the issues which arose in all of the claims.
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff's claim against Malco</b>
<P>

447  	As I stated near the beginning of this judgment, the plaintiff
made two sorts of claims against Malco, namely:-
<P>

448  	(i)	That Malco owed the plaintiff duties analogous to those
owed by an employer to an employee, including duties to take reasonable
care to
provide safe plant and equipment and a safe system of work (in particular, it
was alleged that the forklift was defective),
that Malco had breached those
duties and that, by reason of those breaches, the plaintiff had been
injured.
<P>

449  	(ii)	Malco was vicariously liable for casual acts of negligence
by its employee Mr Onody, by reason of which the plaintiff
had been injured.
<P>

450  	I will deal with these two sorts of claims in turn.
<P>

451  	(i)	Counsel for the plaintiff, while accepting, and indeed
submitting, that the plaintiff's employer was Skilled, and not
Malco, submitted
that Malco occupied a position substantially similar to that of an employer and
owed duties to the plaintiff commensurate
with those of an employer.
<P>

452  	Counsel for Malco submitted that, as Skilled and not Malco was
the plaintiff's employer, Malco did not owe any duty to the
plaintiff or at
least did not owe any duty to the plaintiff in the particular circumstances of
this case, it being contended that
at the time he was injured the plaintiff was
engaged in an enterprise ("frolic") of his own.
<P>

453  	I consider that counsel for the plaintiff's submissions should
be accepted.  Malco did occupy a position substantially similar
to that of an
employer.  It was Malco who communicated with the plaintiff and asked him to
work on the Malco project at the Mill.
Malco asked that the plaintiff's labour
be hired to it through "a body hire company".  It was immaterial to Malco which
body hire
company was used.  It is substantially true to say that Skilled, the
body hire company selected, was like a conduit for the rendering
of the
plaintiff's labour for the benefit of Malco.  The plaintiff had also worked in
an earlier stage of the work being done by
Malco at the Mill.
<P>

454  	At the Mill the plaintiff worked as a member of a crew or gang,
the other members of which were two Malco employees, Mr Dyson
and Mr Onody, in
carrying out the operations of Malco.  Mr Dyson was in charge of the group and
it was he would give instructions
to the plaintiff.  Each morning the plaintiff
reported to Mr Dyson.  Although decisions were often group decisions, if there
was
any difference of opinion, it would be Mr Dyson's opinion which would
prevail. 
<P>

455  	The plant which was used by the group (unless it was borrowed
at the site) was supplied by Malco.  The forklift itself had
been hired by
Malco. The welding leads which were being used to jump start the boom lift were
supplied by Malco.
<P>

456  	After the plaintiff's wages were paid to him by Skilled,
Skilled was reimbursed for those wages by Malco.
<P>

457  	When all of these matters are taken into account, it is clear
that Malco occupied a position substantially similar to that
of an employer.
<P>

458  	It is also quite clear that in attempting to jump start the
boom lift, which had been used by Mr Dyson to fix bolts in the
overhead gantry,
so that either the boom of the boom lift could be lowered or the boom lift
could be returned to the place from which
it had been taken, the plaintiff was
engaged in the operations of Malco, and not on some frolic of his own.
<P>

459  	I am satisfied that Malco breached the duties which, as a
person akin to the plaintiff's employer, it owed to the plaintiff,.
 The
forklift was defective and unsafe and before the accident happened the
plaintiff had complained to Malco's employee, Mr Dyson,
about the forklift and
had asked Mr Dyson to have the forklift replaced.  There was a risk of injury
from using the forklift which
was reasonably foreseeable. Reasonably
practicable alternative steps available to Malco which would have obviated the
risk were to
get rid of the forklift and replace it with some other piece of
equipment or to equip the forklift with a switch of the kind which
Mr Morgan
subsequently had installed in the forklift.  The plaintiff was injured by
reason of the unsafe condition of the forklift
and in all the circumstances
Malco failed to take reasonable care for the safety of the plaintiff.
<P>

460  	(ii)	It was submitted that Mr Onody was negligent in two
respects:-
<P>

(a)	In inadvertently bumping the gear levers and the handbrake of the fork
lift, so as to put the gear levers into gear and to release
the handbrake,
either when he extended his arm into the cabin of the forklift to turn the
ignition on or when he withdrew his arm
after having turned the ignition on.
<P>

(b)	In starting the forklift engine and then leaving the forklift while its
engine was running and the plaintiff was standing near
the forklift.
<P>

461  	I have already found that Mr Onody did not bump any of the
controls of the forklift, so that the first particular of alleged
negligence by
Mr Onody has not been established.
<P>

462  	As regards the second particular of alleged negligence by Mr
Onody, it is true that Mr Onody started the forklift and then
left the
forklift, while its engine was running and the plaintiff was standing near the
forklift. However, I do not consider that
Mr Onody should be found to have
acted negligently in acting as he did. The plaintiff had knowledge and
experience of forklifts,
as Mr Onody knew. Mr Onody himself did not have any
knowledge or experience of forklifts. Mr Onody was told by the plaintiff to
turn
on the engine of the forklift and he complied. He was assured by the
plaintiff that the forklift would not move. He was then told
by the plaintiff
to go and get a clamp and he complied with the plaintiff's request.  In acting
as he was told to act by the plaintiff,
I do not consider that Mr Onody was
negligent.
<P>

463  	Alternatively, even if Mr Onody should be regarded as having
been negligent, I do not consider that his negligence was a cause
of the
accident. Even if Mr Onody had remained on or near the forklift, I do not
consider that he could reasonably have been expected
to have reacted promptly
enough in an appropriate way to have prevented the forklift travelling the
distance of less than a metre
which it travelled before trapping the
plaintiff's foot and leg. The plaintiff himself did not notice that the
forklift was moving
before the forklift trapped his foot and did not make any
utterance, before his foot was trapped, which would have served as a warning
to
Mr Onody. When Mr Onody, having heard the plaintiff cry out, did attempt to
stop the forklift, he took the quite reasonable step
of reversing what he had
done to start the engine, that is, turn the ignition key. However, as the
forklift had a diesel powered
engine, the taking of this step did not arrest
the forward movement of the forklift and the forklift was stopped, only when,
after
frantic activity by Mr Onody and Mr Dyson, Mr Dyson found and applied the
kill switch.
<P>

464  	My finding that Mr Onody was not negligent has consequences for
some of the cross-claims.
<P>

465  	There should be a verdict for the plaintiff against Malco, as a
result of the plaintiff succeeding on claim (i).
<P>

<b>The plaintiff's claim against Skilled</b>
<P>

466  	Skilled admitted that it was the plaintiff's employer and
conceded that it owed the duties of an employer to the plaintiff.
<P>

467  	Skilled hired the plaintiff's labour to Malco but Skilled could
not thereby divest itself of its obligations to the plaintiff
as his employer.
The duties of an employer are "non-delegable", in the sense that performance of
the duties cannot be delegated by
the employer to a contractor, on the footing
that delegation to a competent contractor is a sufficient performance of the
duties.
The employer is liable for any negligence on the part of the contractor
in not taking reasonable care to provide a safe system of
work or safe
equipment for the employer's employee. <i>Kondis v State Transport
Authority</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20154%20CLR%20672" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 154 CLR 672.</a>
<P>

468  	In the present case, Skilled itself did nothing by way of
performing its obligations as the plaintiff's employer and it is
liable for
Malco's negligence in not providing a safe system of work or safe equipment.
<P>

469  	Accordingly, there should be a verdict for the plaintiff
against Skilled.
<P>

<b>Contributory negligence</b>
<P>

470  	It was submitted by a number of the defendants and
cross-defendants that the plaintiff had been guilty of contributory
negligence.
<P>

471  	Although it was asserted that the plaintiff had been
contributorily negligent in a number of respects, the two principal respects
asserted were that the plaintiff had been negligent:-
<P>

(i)	in leaving the forklift in gear, in both the main gears and the
forward-reverse gear, when he parked the forklift.
<P>

(ii)	in assuming a dangerous position near the forklift and remaining in that
position after he had told Mr Onody to start the forklift
and after Mr Onody
had left the vicinity of the forklift to look for a clamp.
<P>

As regards (i):-
<P>

472  	Counsel for the plaintiff accepted that the plaintiff had
intended, when he parked the forklift, to put the forklift out of
gear in both
gears and that the plaintiff had failed to do so. However, it was submitted
that the plaintiff's failure was solely
attributable to the defective condition
of the forklift, including that the main gears were "sloppy" and the positions
of the gears
were not marked and that the forward-reverse gear had no true
neutral.
<P>

473  	I do not accept the submission that the plaintiff's failure was
solely attributable to the defective condition of the forklift.
The plaintiff
said in his evidence that his invariable procedure in stopping the forklift was
to take the following steps in the
following order, to put the main gear lever
in neutral, then release the clutch, then put the forward-reverse lever in
neutral, and
then switch the engine off and apply the handbrake.  The adoption
of this method enabled the plaintiff to be "certain" that he had
put the
forklift out of gear.
<P>

474  	If the plaintiff had followed this procedure and he had not in
fact succeeded, as a first step, in putting the main gear into
neutral, then I
consider it likely that he would have realised his mistake from the behaviour
of the forklift, when he released the
clutch.  I consider it probable that the
plaintiff in parking the forklift did not in fact follow the procedure he said
he always
adopted.  He ought to have followed such a procedure, particularly
having regard to his knowledge that the forklift was defective,
including that
its handbrake was defective.
<P>

475  	As to the forward-reverse lever, I have accepted Mr Morgan's
evidence that the forward-reverse gear did not have a true neutral
position.
However, the lever could be put into a position where the forward-reverse gear
was in fact disengaged and the plaintiff
himself said in his evidence that when
he was driving the forklift on the days preceding the day of the accident he
had had no difficulty
in using the forward-reverse lever and "finding neutral".
I consider that there was some negligence by the plaintiff in not achieving
the
result that the forward-reverse lever was put in a position where the
forward-reverse gear was disengaged.
<P>

476  	I find that there was some negligence on the plaintiff's part
in parking the forklift with both of its gears engaged and that
this negligence
by the plaintiff contributed to the happening of the accident.
<P>

As regards (ii)
<P>

477  	I do not consider that I should find that the plaintiff was
contributorily negligent in this respect, independently of (i).
If either the
main gear or the forward-reverse gear had been put into neutral, the forklift
could not have moved forward and there
would have been no risk involved in the
plaintiff taking up, and remaining in, a position near the forklift.
<P>

478  	Having found that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent, I
have to determine to what extent I consider it just and equitable
to reduce the
plaintiff's damages, having regard to the plaintiff's share in the
responsibility for the damage. I have to assess
the plaintiff's share of the
responsibility against the totality of the tortious conduct of the two
defendants. In my opinion, the
overwhelming proportion of the responsibility
should be attributed to the defendants for their failure to take reasonable
care to
provide a safe system of work and safe equipment.
<P>

479  	I assess the defendants' share of responsibility at ninety
percent and the plaintiff's share of responsibility at ten percent.
<P>

<b>Damages</b>
<P>

480  	A question which was debated at the hearing was whether, if the
plaintiff obtained a verdict, the damages to be awarded to
the plaintiff should
be assessed at common law or subject to Pt 6 of the <i>Motor Accidents Act</i>
or subject to division 3 of Pt 5 of the <i>Workers' Compensation Act </i>or
partly on one such basis and partly on another.  It was recognised that what
basis or bases of assessing damages should be adopted
would depend on what
findings I made on certain factual issues.  It was agreed that after I had
delivered a preliminary judgment
the parties should have the opportunity of
making further submissions as to what basis or bases of assessment of damages
should be
adopted, in the light of the findings of fact I made in the
preliminary judgment.
<P>

481  	Apart from this general question of how damages should be
assessed, it became apparent during the hearing and it has become
even more
apparent to me during the period that this judgment has been reserved, that it
would be impracticable for me in this preliminary
judgment to attempt to
resolve all questions of damages. I propose in this preliminary judgment to
decide only certain issues relating
to damages.
<P>

482  	I have already in this judgment summarised parts of the
evidence of the plaintiff and his wife which are relevant to the damages
which
should be awarded to the plaintiff.
<P>

483  	There were admitted into evidence in the plaintiff's case
medical reports by Dr Isbister, who was the treating orthopaedic
surgeon, Dr
Combe an orthopaedic surgeon, Dr White a neurologist and Dr Kenny a
psychiatrist. The last three of these doctors had
seen the plaintiff for
medico-legal purposes.
<P>

484  	There were also admitted into evidence in the plaintiff's case
a number of reports by Ravagnani &amp; Associates, injury management
and
medico-legal specialists.
<P>

485  	The only medical report tendered by any party other than the
plaintiff was a report by Mr Adrian Van der Rijt, an orthopaedic
surgeon, of 19
May 1997. Mr Van der Rijt's report would not appear to me to be significantly
different from the plaintiff's medical
evidence. To the extent of any
inconsistency, I prefer the plaintiff's medical evidence.
<P>

486  	The only oral medical evidence at the hearing was brief
evidence given by Dr Isbister, mainly regarding opinions expressed
by Ravagnani
&amp; Associates on the plaintiff's needs for care and assistance.
<P>

487  	The plaintiff's principal injuries and the treatment he
received are conveniently set out in Dr Isbister's reports, especially
his
first report of 17 February 1997. This report contains the following
passages:
<P>

"He (the plaintiff) suffered injury on 4/11/95 when he was run over by a
fork-lift truck which caused a comminuted fracture in the
subtrochanteric area
of his right femur, fractures of the superior and inferior left pubic rami of
the pelvis. As a result of this
injury he also suffered from haematuria."
<P>

In a later report of 7 September 1998 Dr Isbister said that the plaintiff had
also suffered "a fracture through the left medial
malleolus of the ankle and
the neck of his 5th metatarsal bone".
<P>

"Treatment regarding his right femur initially was by skeletal traction. A pin
was introduced in his right tibia under local anaesthetic
on 4/11/95. On
7/11/95 open reduction and internal fixation of the right upper femur was
carried out using a dynamic hip screw and
plate with defragmentary screws.
<P>

Post-operatively he was also monitored by the urologists for his haematuria and
an IVP examination was also carried out. His thigh
was grossly swollen and the
wound drains were left in for several days. He was gradually sat out of bed and
mobilised.
<P>

He had also complained of a right swollen knee which had also suffered injury
in the accident.
<P>

By the third month following injury he was partial-weight-bearing 50% on one
crutch. His right knee was still tending to cause him
some problems with
clicking and he had crepitus (creaking) behind the patello-femoral joint.
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

The plate and screws were removed from his right hip at the Albury Wodonga
Private Hospital on 16/12/96. He made satisfactory recovery
from this procedure
...
<P>

Bruce White suffered a comminuted fracture of his upper right femur, fractures
of his pelvis and bruising of his urinary tract.
He also suffered bruising of
his right knee. These injuries are all consistent with his having been run over
by a fork lift truck
on 4/11/95."
<P>

488  	In a report of 7 September 1998 Dr Isbister expressed the
following opinions:-
<P>

"In my opinion his condition has stabilised and he is left with residual
disabilities as a result of the injuries to his hip and
pelvis.
<P>

These injuries will prevent him from returning to normal Rigger's job. He is
not able to work at a height nor is he able to lift
heavy weights. In the
future he will only be able to perform sedentary type of occupations.
<P>

In my opinion Bruce White has 20% permanent loss of efficient use of his right
lower limb at or above the elbow (sic) as a result
of the injury which occurred
at work on 4 November 1995.
<P>

He also has 10% permanent impairment of his pelvis as a result of injuries
suffered on 4 November 1995."
<P>

489  	I accept the findings and the opinions expressed by Dr Isbister
in his reports. 
<P>

490  	In his report of 28 April 1997 Dr Combe expressed the following
opinions:-
<P>

"He describes continuing episodic lumbar back pain which I believe is
musculo-ligamentous in origin.
<P>

He has right hip and thigh pain and right knee pain, with tendency to giving
way in the right knee.
<P>

I regard his right hip and knee condition as stable in the medium term. He may
be at long term risk from the development of post
traumatic osteoarthritis in
the right hip and right knee.
<P>

Because of his right hip and right knee, he is permanently unfit to return to
work as a scaffolder and rigger. He is permanently
unfit for work involving
kneeling or squatting, steps or ladder work, or heavier lifting."
<P>

491  	In a later report of 1 December 1997 Dr Combe said that there
appeared to have been no alteration in Mr White's right leg
symptoms or signs
but his back pain had become more troublesome.
<P>

492  	I accept the findings and opinions expressed by Dr Combe in his
reports.
<P>

493  	Dr White found no significant evidence of neurological
abnormality. Dr White expressed the opinion that the plaintiff was
"fit to
continue with relatively sedentary type work activities full time and should
remain so in the future".
<P>

494  	In his report of 1 December 1997 Dr Kenny said, inter alia:-
<P>

"So I say that because of his physical symptoms, he is very restricted in terms
of the employment that he can undertake and very
restricted in his wide range
of recreational activities.
<P>

He has virtually given up riding his Harley Davidson and has given up most of
his extremely physical activities.
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

Now as well as his physical injuries and the disruption to his life that they
cause, it is clear that he has a significant post-traumatic
stress disorder,
caused by this frightening and traumatic experience, and the manifestations of
that include, dreams about the accident,
phobic anxiety about the sort of
environment in which the accident occurred, irritability and easy startling and
a lowering of mood
and emotional lability.
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

So I say he has a significant lowering of mood, a significant level of
frustration, a significant degree of irritability and a significant
level of
post-traumatic stress disorder, in response to the accident, the injuries and
the litigation process."
<P>

495  	I am prepared generally to accept Dr Kenny's findings and
opinions, although I consider that the degree of post traumatic
stress disorder
is somewhat overstated in Dr Kenny's report. The plaintiff in his evidence at
the hearing did not give any evidence
(or very little evidence) of the
"manifestations" of the post traumatic stress disorder noted by Dr Kenny. I
appreciate that the
recording of these "manifestations" by Dr Kenny in his
report can be regarded as some evidence of their truth. However, I would have
given greater weight to evidence given by the plaintiff himself before me.
<P>

496  	Three reports by Ravagnani &amp; Associates were admitted into
evidence. In these reports Ravagnani &amp; Associates inter
alia estimated the
plaintiff's needs for care and assistance and identified factors affecting the
feasibility of his future employment.
Ravagnani &amp; Associates considered
that the plaintiff would have "a moderate to high degree of difficulty in
obtaining employment".
Difficulties the plaintiff would have in obtaining
employment would include the plaintiff's age, his lack of formal education,
that
his work experience had been in manual occupations for which he was no
longer fitted, that he resided in a small country town some
distance from
Albury, that the plaintiff was subject to the physical restrictions noted in
the medical reports and that the plaintiff
experienced on-going pain in his
back and leg.
<P>

<b>Economic Loss</b>
<P>

497  	The plaintiff's claim for economic loss was partly based on a
report by Coopers &amp; Lybrand accountants of 27 March 1998.
In this report
Coopers &amp; Lybrand set out to determine the total economic loss sustained by
the plaintiff as a result of the accident,
consisting of past economic loss,
future economic loss, loss of superannuation and the Fox v Wood component.
<P>

498  	In the report Coopers &amp; Lybrand took 30 June 1997, a now
quite arbitrary date, as marking the dividing line between past
economic loss
and future economic loss. Past economic loss should, of course, be assessed in
relation to the period up to the present
and future economic loss
thereafter.
<P>

499  	Coopers &amp; Lybrand were supplied with copies of the
plaintiff's income tax returns and other taxation records for the years
1991 to
1996. The plaintiff's taxable income as disclosed by these records varied
considerably from year to year, from a high of
$34,379 to a low of $6,585.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand noted that before the accident the plaintiff "was not
fully employed at all times"
and formed the opinion "that Mr White's past
incomes (that is taxable incomes) are not properly reflective of his full
economic capacity
as a boilermaker/rigger". Coopers &amp; Lybrand therefore
discarded the plaintiff's taxation records for the purpose of their
calculations
of economic loss.
<P>

500  	Coopers &amp; Lybrand then expressed the opinion that the wages
the plaintiff had received from Skilled should be used as
the basis for
calculating the plaintiff's economic loss. However, Coopers &amp; Lybrand noted
that they had not received sufficient
information to enable them to determine
what was the weekly wage received by the plaintiff from Skilled.
<P>

501  	In the absence of sufficient information about the weekly wage
received by the plaintiff from Skilled, Coopers &amp; Lybrand
said that they
would use the wages records of an employee of Skilled comparable to the
plaintiff. The comparable employee chosen
was the plaintiff's brother, who was
also a qualified rigger and who had also worked for Skilled. However, the wages
records of the
plaintiff's brother which were used were not the wages records
for a number of years or even for a whole year but the plaintiff's
brother's
pay slips over a period of thirteen weeks only, in which he was employed by
Skilled in Queensland. These pay slips showed
a gross weekly wage of $1,177,
which after the deduction of income tax (which varied slightly from year to
year) produced a net weekly
wage of $787 or $785, say $786. This rate of wage
was then used by Coopers &amp; Lybrand in calculating both the past economic
loss
and the future economic loss suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the
accident.  Coopers &amp; Lybrand said that "we cannot determine
any appropriate
discount due to Mr White's history of (only) periodic employment".
<P>

502  	Coopers &amp; Lybrand's actual calculations of past economic
loss and future economic loss are of little assistance. Even
apart from the
question of whether a gross weekly wage of $1,177 (that is a net weekly wage of
$786) should be adopted and whether
it should be adopted as a wage the
plaintiff would have earned consistently week after week, Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, as I have already
noted, adopted the now quite arbitrary date of 30
June 1997 as marking the dividing point between past economic loss and future
economic
loss and also proceeded on the basis that the plaintiff would continue
to be employed on a full-time basis by CJ's Big Twin Pty Ltd
(the motor cycle
shop).
<P>

503  	In written and oral submissions counsel for the plaintiff
adopted the figure of $786 per week (that is the plaintiff's brother's
net
weekly wage over a period of thirteen weeks) as a basis for calculating damages
for past economic loss. Counsel for the plaintiff
referred to other figures,
including the net weekly incomes of other employees of Skilled over limited
periods and the average weekly
earnings from time to time of a construction
worker. Counsel for the plaintiff also referred to the plaintiff's net weekly
earnings
in the tax year 1994, as derived from his income tax records. However,
the plaintiff's taxable income for this year, which produced
a figure for net
weekly income of $497, was the plaintiff's highest taxable income between 1991
and 1996 and was much higher than
the plaintiff's taxable income for the
preceding year of $16,041 and his taxable income for the following year of
merely $6,585.
<P>

504  	Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the plaintiff's
damages for past economic loss should be calculated according to
the following
steps:-
<P>

(i)	a figure of $786 per week should be taken as a starting point.
<P>

(ii)	this figure should be reduced by twenty percent, to allow for the fact
that the plaintiff, if he had not been injured, would
probably not have worked
full time, thus producing a figure of $628.
<P>

(iii)	the figure of $628 should be multiplied by the number of weeks from the
date of the accident to the date of the hearing (or
judgment).
<P>

(iv)	The amount of the plaintiff's actual earnings while employed by CJ's Big
Twin should be deducted.
<P>

505  	Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that damages for future
economic loss should be calculated on the basis of a net weekly
loss of $500.
This figure would take into account that, if the plaintiff had not been
injured, he would not have worked full-time
and would also take into account
such residual earning capacity as the plaintiff has.  A discount of 15 per cent
should be made for
contingencies.  
<P>

506  	The only submissions made by any of the defendants or
cross-defendants about the quantum of the plaintiff's economic loss
were made
by counsel for Malco.  Counsel for Malco adopted a figure of $500 per week as
the amount the plaintiff would have earned
if he had not been injured and
submitted that in the calculation of both past economic loss as from 17 April
1997 (when the plaintiff
was taken to have commenced working for CJ's Big Twin)
and future economic loss, the plaintiff should be taken to have had a residual
earning capacity of $350 per week, thus producing a net loss of $150 per
week.
<P>

507  	I consider that I can properly have regard to the figure of
$786 per week, while recognising that it needs to be adjusted.
 The plaintiff's
brother is, like the plaintiff, a qualified rigger and was working for the same
employer Skilled.  When the plaintiff
was working full time before the accident
he was probably capable of earning at the rate of $786 net per week.
<P>

508  	As regards future economic loss, counsel for the plaintiff
submitted that I should accept the evidence given by the plaintiff,
corroborated by evidence given by his wife, that when his children were old
enough to leave home the plaintiff would change his lifestyle
and work more of
the time, so as to build up a nest egg for his retirement.  
<P>

509  	I consider that I should give only a little weight to this
evidence.  The plaintiff had for many years before the accident
been pursuing a
lifestyle, congenial to both himself and his wife, under which he worked only
part of the time and spent the rest
of the time in activities which he found
more fulfilling than work.  I consider it highly improbable that the plaintiff,
if he had
not been injured, would have altered this lifestyle to any
significant extent.
<P>

510  	On the other hand, I do not think that I should take literally
some evidence by the plaintiff that before the accident he
worked for only six
months of the year and took six months off.
<P>

511  	Doing the best that I can, I consider that I should adopt the
figure of $500 per week, which was the figure suggested by counsel
for Malco,
as the plaintiff's likely net weekly earnings, had he not been injured.  
<P>

512  	The plaintiff's residual earning capacity after the accident is
limited, for the reasons given by the doctors in their reports
and for the
reasons given by Ravagnani &amp; Associates.  
<P>

513  	I do not consider that the plaintiff's earnings while employed
by C.J's Big Twin (the motor cycle shop) should be taken as
an accurate index
of his residual earning capacity (except during the period he was actually
employed and paid by that company).
 That job was a special job "created" for
the plaintiff, which he obtained through his motor cycle affiliations and in
which special
concessions were made to him.
<P>

514  	On the other hand, the plaintiff has some residual earning
capacity, which I assess at $150 per week.  Accordingly, I consider
that he
should be regarded as having a net weekly economic loss of $350 per week for
the assessment of both past and future economic
loss. 
<P>

515  	I find that damages for past economic loss should be assessed
on the following basis:-
<P>

(i)	Between 4 November 1995 and 17 April 1997, on the basis of total incapacity
at the rate of $500 per week.
<P>

(ii)	Between 17April 1997 and the present 
<P>

(a)	While employed and paid by CJ's Big Twin on the basis of $500 per week,
less the actual wages received from CJ's Big Twin.
<P>

(b)	While not so employed, on the basis of $500 per week, less the value of his
residual earning capacity of $150 per week.
<P>

516  	Damages for future economic loss should be assessed at the rate
of $350 per week from now to when the plaintiff attains his
sixty-fifth
birthday, less a discount for contingencies of 15 per cent.
<P>

517  	The plaintiff will also be entitled to damages for loss of
superannuation and under <b>Fox v Wood</b> and, depending on the basis of
assessment of damages, for some interest on past economic loss.
<P>

<b>Damages under Griffiths v Kerkemeyer</b>
<P>

518  	The plaintiff made claims for the cost of past and future care
and assistance pursuant to the doctrine of <b>Griffiths v Kerkemeyer</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%2d77%29%20139%20CLR%20161" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976-77) 139 CLR 161.</a>
<P>

519  	Having reviewed the evidence including the evidence of the
plaintiff and his wife, the reports of Ravagnani &amp; Associates
and the
evidence of Dr Isbister, I am prepared to allow damages at common law as
claimed in the written submissions of counsel for
the plaintiff, except that I
consider that domestic assistance of only seven hours per week would be
reasonable for both past and
future domestic assistance. I accordingly allow
damages at common law under the doctrine of <b>Griffiths v Kerkemeyer</b> as
follows:-
<P>

Care rendered by the plaintiff's wife for a total
<P>

of 6 weeks after 2 periods of hospitalisation	2,100.00
<P>

Cost of painting the plaintiff's house 	1,085.00
<P>

Cost of concreting the driveway and patio
<P>

of the plaintiff's house					3,000.00
<P>

Past domestic assistance 7 hrs per week at
<P>

$25 per week for the number of weeks from
<P>

the date of the accident to the present, less the
<P>

period of 6 weeks during which the plaintiff was
<P>

hospitalised 					
<P>

Future domestic assistance 7 hrs per week from
<P>

now for the rest of the plaintiff's life expectancy
<P>

520  	If damages are to be assessed in accordance with the
<i>Motor</i><b> </b><i>Accidents Act</i> or the <i>Workers' Compensation
Act</i>, any damages to be awarded under the doctrine of <b>Griffiths v
Kerkemeyer</b> will have to be assessed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the relevant Act.
<P>

<b>Out-of-pocket expenses</b>
<P>

521  	Past out-of-pocket expenses paid by Skilled	28,403.00
<P>

522  	Future out-of-pocket expenses. I allow damages for future
out-of-pocket expenses as claimed in counsel for the plaintiff's
written
submissions. These claims are supported by some evidence by Ravagnani &amp;
Associates.
<P>

Physiotherapist	3,000.00
<P>

Counselling	5,920.00
<P>

Occupational rehabilitation	20,000.00
<P>

Future medication at the rate of $13.85
<P>

per week for the rest of the plaintiff's
<P>

life expectancy
<P>

<b>General Damages (damages for non-economic loss)</b>
<P>

523  	So far as the assessment of damages in accordance with the
<i>Motor Accidents Act</i> or the <i>Workers' Compensation Act</i> is
concerned, it was submitted by counsel for the plaintiff that the severity of
the plaintiff's non-economic loss was between forty-five
percent and fifty
percent of the severity of a most extreme case. It was submitted by counsel for
Malco that the appropriate figure
was thirty percent. I consider that the
plaintiff's case should be assessed at forty-five percent of the severity of a
most extreme
case.
<P>

524  	If a figure of $350,000 or thereabouts is regarded as an
appropriate amount to be awarded as general damages in a most extreme
case,
then the amount of general damages at common law would be forty-five percent of
$350,000.
<P>

525  	If damages are assessed at common law, the damages the
plaintiff should be awarded, in accordance with the counsel for the
plaintiff's
written submissions, would include the following items:
<P>

Past economic loss
<P>

Interest on past economic loss
<P>

Future economic loss
<P>

Loss of superannuation
<P>

Fox v Wood
<P>

Damages under Griffiths v Kerkemeyer<b> </b>past and future
<P>

Out of pocket expenses past and future
<P>

526  	The amount of the workers' compensation defence will have to be
deducted from the amount of damages which would otherwise
be awarded and a
deduction of ten percent will have to be made by reason of the plaintiff's
contributory negligence. 
<P>

<b>Cross-claims</b>
<P>

527  	As I indicated earlier in this judgment, a very large number of
cross-claims containing a very large number of causes of action
were brought in
the proceedings.  Some of these causes of action were baldly asserted rather
than supported by any reasoned argument.
  On some of the claims I did not have
the benefit of submissions from both of the parties.
<P>

528  	In the circumstances, I do not propose to endeavour to
determine all of the claims in all of the cross-claims in this preliminary
judgment. I will, however, determine some claims in the cross-claims, the
determination of which is particularly important for the
resolution of the case
generally.
<P>

<b>Cross-claims for contribution and/or indemnity between the two defendants
(the third cross-claim and part of the fifth cross-claim).</b>
<P>

529  	Each of Malco and Skilled brought a cross-claim against the
other, claiming contribution or indemnity pursuant to s 5 of the
<i>Law</i><b>
</b><i>Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act</i> 1946.
<P>

530  	Having regard to the conclusions I have reached on the
plaintiff's claims against them, each of Malco and Skilled is a tortfeasor
liable in respect of the damage suffered by the plaintiff; hence, each is
entitled to bring a claim against the other for contribution
for indemnity.
<P>

531  	Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lrpa404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lrpa404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act</a></i> the amount of the contribution recoverable is to be such as may be
found by the court to be just and equitable, having regard to
the extent of
that party's responsibility for the damage.
<P>

532  	I consider that, as between Malco and Skilled, Malco should
bear by far the greater share of the responsibility for the damage.
The
plaintiff was selected as a worker by Malco and was working in Malco's
operations, with Malco's employees, under the direction
of an employee of
Malco, according to a system of work devised by Malco and using equipment
provided by Malco. It had been immaterial
to Malco whether Skilled, or some
other body hire company, was interposed between the plaintiff and Malco. Malco
knew that Skilled
would play no part, and I infer that Malco would not have
countenanced Skilled playing any part, in devising the system of work to
which
the plaintiff would be subjected or in providing the equipment with which the
plaintiff was to work.
<P>

533  	On the other hand, I do not consider that Skilled should be
completely indemnified by Malco. Skilled assumed the position
of an employer
and then did nothing for the safety of its employee.
<P>

534  	Having regard to the extent of each defendant's responsibility
for the damage, I find it to be just and equitable that Malco
should be eighty
percent responsible and Skilled should be twenty percent responsible for the
plaintiff's damage.
<P>

<b>Cross-claims based on an alleged statutory agency</b>
<P>

535  	A number of cross-claims were based on allegations that the
cross-defendant was the "owner" of the forklift, that the cross-defendant,
if
it had been sued by the plaintiff, would have been liable to the plaintiff by
virtue of s 53 of the <i>Motor Accidents Act</i> and that accordingly the
cross-defendant was a person from whom contribution or indemnity could be
sought. Most of these cross-claims
were brought against Syd-Fam but some of
them were brought against Lift Truck Services or Liftqip.
<P>

536  	It was common ground that the forklift was a motor vehicle,
that the forklift was registered as a motor vehicle in the State
of Victoria
and that the forklift was not registered as a motor vehicle in this State
(leaving aside, for the moment, the question
of whether the forklift was
"registered" or "unregistered" within the terms of New South Wales
legislation).
<P>

537  	It was also common ground that, because the accident had
happened in New South Wales, it was necessary to apply New South
Wales
legislation. Section 53 of the <i>Motor Accidents Act</i> provides in part:-
<P>

"(1)	For the purpose of:
<P>

(a)	any proceedings against the owner of a motor vehicle, whether severally or
jointly with the driver of the vehicle, for the recovery
of damages for
liability in respect of the death of or injury to a person caused by the fault
of the driver of the vehicle in the
use or operation of the vehicle, and
<P>

<center>*  *  *</center>
<P>


<P>

any person (other than the owner) who was, at the time of the occurrence out of
which the proceedings arose, the driver of the vehicle
(whether with or without
the authority of the owner) shall be taken to be the agent of the owner acting
within the scope of the agent's
authority in relation to the vehicle."
<P>

538  	It is apparent that, for s 53 to apply, a number of conditions
must be satisfied; the person against whom the proceedings
are brought must be
the owner and the proceedings must be for the recovery of damages for liability
in respect of injury to a person
(i) caused (ii) by the fault (iii) of the
driver of the vehicle (iv) in the use or operation of the vehicle.
<P>

539  	In the present case, the only person (apart from the plaintiff
himself) who could have been the driver of the forklift was
Mr Onody.  On the
findings I have already made, even if Mr Onody was the driver of the forklift,
there was no fault on the part of
Mr Onody or, alternatively, if there was any
fault on the part of Mr Onody, the plaintiff's injury was not caused by such a
fault.
Accordingly, all of the cross-claims based on an alleged statutory
agency fail and it is unnecessary to determine whether any of
the other
conditions for the application of s 53 were satisfied. However, there was much
debate at the hearing about some of these
conditions and it is desirable that I
express some views on at least some of these conditions.
<P>

540  	The question of who was the "owner" of the forklift was the
subject of some submissions at the hearing. In s 3(1) of the <i>Motor</i><b>
</b><i>Accidents Act</i> "owner" in relation to a motor vehicle is defined as
meaning a person who is the owner of the vehicle by virtue of sub-sections (3)
to (5). Subsection (3) of s 3 draws a distinction between a motor vehicle which
is "registered" and a motor vehicle which is "unregistered".
There was argument
about whether a motor vehicle, which is registered in Victoria but which is not
registered in New South Wales,
is "registered" or "unregistered" for the
purposes of sub-section (3).
<P>

541  	"Registration" is defined in s 3 of the <i>Motor Accidents
Act</i> as meaning (so far as is relevant) "registration of a motor vehicle
under the Motor <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ta77/" class="autolink_findacts">Traffic Act</a>". "Registered" is defined in s 2 of the <i>Motor
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ta77/" class="autolink_findacts">Traffic Act</a></i> as meaning registered under and in accordance with regulations
made under that Act.
<P>

542  	The forklift was not registered under or in accordance with the
regulations under the <i>Motor <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ta77/" class="autolink_findacts">Traffic Act</a></i>. However, an argument was sought
to be based on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ta77/s33a.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 33A</a> of the regulations which exempts from
registration "visiting motor vehicles" (defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ta77/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 2</a> as vehicles
brought for temporary use within the State), which are registered in another
State and display the relevant registration
label of that other State and which
have either been in New South Wales continuously for less than three months or
driven in New
South Wales by an exempt person under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ta77/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 31(1A).</a>
<P>

543  	It is unclear on the evidence whether all of the conditions for
exemption under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ta77/s33a.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 33A</a> were satisfied in the present case. In any
event, it appears to me that a motor vehicle which is not registered in New
South Wales,
even though it is exempt from registration under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ta77/s33a.html" class="autolink_findacts">regulation 33A</a>,
is nevertheless "unregistered" in New South Wales. See <b>Zussino v Zussino</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281969%29%2071%20SR%20%28NSW%29%2024" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1969) 71 SR (NSW) 24.</a>
<P>

544  	If the forklift was "unregistered" in New South Wales, then
under s 3(3)(b) of the <i>Motor Accidents Act</i> the owner is the person who
is entitled to immediate possession of the forklift. The question of who was
entitled to immediate possession
of the forklift was not fully examined at the
hearing. At the hearing the parties could not know what findings of fact I
would ultimately
make, which might be relevant to the question of who was
entitled to immediate possession of the forklift. A possibly relevant finding
of fact I have made is that Syd-Fam did not consent to the forklift being hired
out by Liftqip. A question which may arise is whether
sub-section (4) of s 3,
apart from its obvious application in the case of a motor vehicle which is
registered, also has some application
in the case of a motor vehicle which is
unregistered. I do not propose to attempt to make a finding on this issue in
this judgment.
<P>

545  	If, contrary to the view I have expressed, the forklift was
"registered", then the only person in whose name the forklift
could be said to
be registered would be Syd-Fam. Accordingly, Syd-Fam would be the owner, unless
it had ceased to have possession
of the forklift.  The only way in which
Syd-Fam could have parted with the possession of the forklift would have been
for it to have
parted with possession to Lift Truck Services for the purpose of
sale or repair, not involving the use of the forklift for the benefit
of Lift
Truck Services. Accordingly, by virtue of sub-section (4) of s 3, Syd-Fam would
be taken not to have ceased to have possession
of the forklift and Syd-Fam
would have remained the owner of the forklift.
<P>

546  	The question of whether there had been a "use or operation" of
the forklift was canvassed to some extent at the hearing. 
I was referred to
the decision of the High Court in <b>GIO of New South Wales v King</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1960/60.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1960] HCA 60</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281960%29%20104%20CLR%2093" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1960)
104 CLR 93</a> and particularly the judgment of Menzies J at p 99-100.
<P>

547  	In <b>GIO of New South Wales v King </b>the High Court was
concerned with s 15 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/mvpia1942396/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Vehicles (Third Party Insurance) Act</i>
1942</a> which used the expression "caused by or arising out of the use of an
insured motor vehicle".
<P>

548  	At p 99 Menzies J said:
<P>

"I am not in doubt that to start the engine of a motor vehicle preparatory to
driving off is part of the use of a motor vehicle
 itself, nor do I doubt that
to drive a motor vehicle to test whether repairs have been effective is to use
the motor vehicle. I
have however, found some difficulty in determining what is
the central question here, ie, whether the starting of an engine of a
motor
vehicle in the course of repairing it or to test the efficacy of repairs made
can properly be said to amount to a use of the
motor vehicle itself.
<P>

It is, I think, inadvisable to attempt what might well be impossible, namely,
the drawing of a hard and fast line between things
which do and things which do
not amount to the use of a motor vehicle for the purpose of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/mvpia1942396/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Vehicles
(Third Party Insurance) Act</a>, but I do find it possible to enumerate some things
that clearly do constitute the use of a motor vehicle and some things that do
not."
<P>

549  	Menzies J then proceeded to give a number of examples.
<P>

550  	There is no doubt that in <b>GIO of New South Wales v King</b>
Menzies J expounded a conception of what would amount to the "use" of a motor
vehicle, which is fairly restrictive. However, the
expression used in s 53 of
the <i>Motor Accidents Act</i> is "use or operation" and I would infer that
this expression is intended to be wider than the word "use" standing by itself.
See
also s 3(6) of the <i>Motor Accidents</i><b> </b><i>Act</i>. Later
decisions have tended to widen the conception of what amounts to the use or
operation of a motor vehicle. I was referred inter
alia to <b>Shortland County
Council v GIO<i> </i></b>(1973) 2 NSWLR 251 and <b>Commercial &amp; General
Insurance Co Ltd v GIO of New South Wales</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20129%20CLR%20374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 129 CLR 374</a><b>; State

Another authority is <b>NSW Insurance Ministerial Corporation v Handford</b>

<P>

551  	Having regard to the different statutory language and the trend
of authority, I consider that in a case such as the present
there probably was
a "use or operation" of the forklift, where the engine of the forklift had been
deliberately started, even if
not for the purpose of driving the forklift.
Earlier the forklift had been driven to where the boom lift was and, if the
accident
had not happened, then (I infer), after the boom lift had been started
or moved, the forklift would have been driven away. However,
it is unnecessary
for me to express a final opinion.
<P>

552  	I have held that all the cross-claims based on allegations that
the cross-defendant was the owner of the forklift fail. If
I had held that any
of those cross-claims succeeded and there was no other basis on which the
cross-defendant was liable, I would
have held that the cross-defendant was
entitled to a full indemnity against the defendants or at least one of the
defendants.
<P>

553  	I am satisfied that the only basis on which a cross-claim
against Syd-Fam could have succeeded would have been if Syd-Fam
was liable by
reason of the statutory agency under s 53 of the <i>Motor</i><b>
</b><i>Accidents Act</i>. As I have held that all cross-claims based on an
alleged statutory agency fail, it follows that all the cross-claims against
Syd-Fam
fail and it is unnecessary for me to consider the cross-claims brought
by Syd-Fam itself.
<P>

<b>Cross-claim by Malco against Prevwreck (the seventh cross-claim).</b>
<P>

554  	In counsel for Malco's final submissions Malco's cross-claim
against Prevwreck was put in four ways, which can be summarised
as:-
<P>

(i)	a claim for damages for breaches of terms which were said to be implied in
the contract for the hire of the forklift from Prevwreck
to Malco by virtue of
s 71 of the <i>Trade Practices Act</i> (Cth).
<P>

(ii)	a claim for an indemnity from Prevwreck under clause 8 of the conditions
on the reverse of the white copy of Malco's form of
purchase order, which, it
was submitted, formed part of the contract for the hire of the forklift.
<P>

(iii)	a claim under s 53(a) of the <i>Trade Practices Act</i>.
<P>

(iv)	a claim under s 52 of the <i>Trade Practices Act</i>.
<P>

555  	It is convenient to deal first with claim (ii).
<P>

<b>Claim (ii)</b>
<P>

556  	Earlier in this judgment I quoted the terms of clause 8 of the
conditions on the reverse of the white copy of Malco's form
of purchase order.
Malco would not be entitled to an indemnity under clause 8, unless the
conditions on the reverse of the white
copy of the purchase order were
incorporated into the contract for the hire of the forklift from Prevwreck to
Malco and clause 8
on its proper interpretation applied to the present
facts.
<P>

557  	I do not consider that the conditions on the reverse of the
white copy of the purchase order were incorporated into the contract
for the
hire of the forklift.  In my opinion, the making of the contract between
Prevwreck and Malco was concluded, when Mr Moore
spoke on the telephone with Mr
Hudson of Prevwreck, and any later sending of a purchase order by Malco would
have been ineffectual
to add to the terms of a contract the making of which had
already been concluded. If the contract for the hire of the forklift was
not
made during the telephone conversation between Mr Moore and Mr Hudson, then at
the latest it was made when the front only of
the purchase order was faxed by
Malco to Prevwreck.
<P>

558  	It was submitted on behalf of Malco that the conditions on the
reverse of the white copy of the form of purchase order were
incorporated into
the contract for the hire of the forklift by reason of a previous course of
dealing between the parties in which
in many previous transactions Malco had
invariably sent to Prevwreck the same form of purchase order including the
reverse of the
purchase order. However, the only (or principal) evidence of
such a previous course of dealing was given by Mr Moore and I have already
indicated that I have formed an unfavourable view of Mr Moore's credibility.
Having stated in positive and categorical terms what
he said had been the
invariable practice, Mr Moore then had to retract important parts of his
evidence. I am not satisfied that such
a previous course of dealing as was
alleged by Malco has been proved. 
<P>

559  	Furthermore, I do not consider that the conditions on the
reverse of the white copy of the Malco form of purchase order, and
particularly
clause 8, would apply to the present facts. According to the printed terms on
the purchase order the purchase order
is an order for the purchase of goods,
not for the hire of goods. The person to whom the order is directed is
described as the "seller".
Clause 8 itself is introduced by the words "in the
event any article sold and delivered hereunder ..."
<P>

560  	It would seem that the Malco printed purchase order for the
purchase of goods was used, indiscriminately, by Malco as a convenient
piece of
paper on which to write many sorts of orders, however inappropriate the printed
terms were to what was being ordered.  The
same form was used for ordering the
supply of labour from Skilled. An employee of Malco would write on the form
what it was that
Malco was really ordering. In the present case Mr Moore wrote
the word "hire" on the form, together with particulars of the hiring.
<P>

561  	I reject Malco's claim for an indemnity under clause 8 of the
conditions on the reverse of the white copy of Malco's form
of purchase order
for the purchase of goods.
<P>

<b>Claim (i)</b>
<P>

562  	Section 71(1) of the <i>Trade Practices Act</i> provides in
part as follows:
<P>

"where a corporation supplies ... goods to a consumer in the course of a
business there is an implied condition that the goods supplied
under the
contract for the supply of the goods are of merchantable quality" (subject to
certain qualifications, which are not applicable
in the present case).
<P>

563  	Section 72(2) provides in part as follows:-
<P>

"where a corporation supplies ... goods to a consumer in the course of a
business and the consumer expressly or by implication makes
known to the
corporation any particular purpose for which the goods are being acquired,
there is an implied condition that the goods
supplied under the contract for
the supply of the goods are reasonably fit for that purpose ... except where
the circumstances show
that the consumer does not rely or it is unreasonable
for him ... to rely on the skill or judgment of the corporation".
<P>

564  	It is clear that Prevwreck was a corporation and that in hiring
the forklift to Malco it was "supplying" goods in the course
of a business and
that it was made known to Prevwreck that the forklift was required for use as a
forklift at the ANM Mill in the
upgrade of plant at the Mill.
<P>

565  	However, the question arises whether Malco was "a consumer".
"Consumer" is defined in s 4B of the <i>Trade Practices Act</i><b>.</b> Section
4B(1)(a) provides as follows:-
<P>

"4B	(1)  For the purposes of this Act, unless the contrary intention
appears:
<P>

(a)	a person shall be taken to have acquired particular goods as a consumer if,
and only if:
<P>

(i)	the price of the goods did not exceed the prescribed amount; or
<P>

(ii)	where that price exceeded the prescribed amount - the goods were of a kind
ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household
use or consumption or
the goods consisted of a commercial road vehicle;
<P>

and the person did not acquire the goods, or hold himself or herself out as
acquiring the goods, for the purpose of re-supply or
for the purpose of using
them up or transforming them, in trade or commerce, in the course of a process
of production or manufacture
or of repairing or treating other goods or
fixtures on land;  "
<P>

566  	Sub-paragraph (ii) of para (a) of s 4B(1) is clearly
inapplicable. However, it was submitted by counsel for Malco that sub-para
(i)
applied, in that the price of the forklift did not exceed the prescribed
amount. 
<P>

567  	Under sub-section (2) of s 4B the prescribed amount is $40,000.
Under s 4B(2)(d) where goods are acquired otherwise than by
way of purchase,
the price of the goods shall be taken to have been the price at which at the
time of acquisition the person acquiring
the goods could have purchased the
goods from the supplier or, in certain circumstances, the lowest price at which
the person acquiring
the goods could have purchased the goods from another
supplier or the value of the goods.
<P>

568  	There would not appear to have been any evidence of the price
or value of the forklift at the hearing. Certainly, in the final
submissions of
the parties I was not referred to any. However, sub-section (3) of s 4B
provides that where in any proceeding it is
alleged that any person was a
consumer it is to be presumed, unless the contrary is established, that the
person was a consumer.
Accordingly, in the absence of any evidence to the
contrary, it is to be presumed that Malco was a consumer.  Consequently the
terms
set out in s 71 are to be implied in the contract for the hire of the
forklift from Prevwreck to Malco.
<P>

569  	Even apart from the <i>Trade Practices Act</i>, at common law a
term is implied in a contract for the hire of a chattel, in the absence of some
provision in the contract to the
contrary, that the chattel is reasonably fit
for the purpose for which it is being hired, that is, a purpose made known by
the person
taking the chattel on hire or apparent from the nature of the
chattel.

<P>

"Before us and, apparently, in the Supreme Court there was considerable
discussion whether the common law rules relating to the
implication in a
contract for the sale of goods of a general condition that the goods shall be
reasonably fit for a specified purpose
apply with equal force to a hire
purchase agreement relating to goods. On principle there is, we think, no
reason whatever for thinking
that they do not and we agree generally with the

implication of such a general condition at common law was that it should
appear,
in effect, that the buyer had bought on the seller's judgment that the

649-650, Taylor J at 656-7 and Windeyer J at 659.
<P>

572  	In the present case it was made known to Prevwreck that the
forklift was required for use in a plant upgrade at the ANM Mill.
I am
satisfied that Malco relied on Prevwreck's judgment that the forklift it
supplied would be fit for the purpose for which Malco
required it, including
that its gears and handbrake were functioning properly and that it would not
have any dangerous propensity.
Malco did not know that Prevwreck would acquire
a forklift from another source and not supply a forklift from its own stock.
There
was no provision in the contract of hire between Prevwreck and Malco
excluding such an implied term.
<P>

573  	Whether a term of reasonable fitness for the purpose for which
the forklift was required was implied in the contract of hire
under s 71(2) of
the <i>Trade Practices Act</i> or at common law, then I am satisfied that it
was breached. Inter alia the forklift would not be reasonably fit if it
contained some
defect which would be a source of potential danger to someone
using the forklift. See <b>Derbyshire Building Co Pty Ltd</b> at p 649 per
Kitto J. An implied term as to the fitness of a chattel supplied under a
contract for the sale or hire of the chattel
is not limited to fitness insofar
as the supplier knew or ought to have known. See <b>Derbyshire Building Co Pty
Ltd</b> at p 649 per Kitto J.
<P>

574  	I am further satisfied that by reason of the breach of the
implied term of reasonable fitness for the purpose Malco suffered
damage
consisting of the damages it has to pay the plaintiff. Such damage would not,
in my opinion, be too remote. The loss consisting
of the liability in damages
to a person working for the hirer because of the unfitness of the chattel would
have been within the
contemplation of a reasonable person in the position of
Prevwreck. See<b><i> </i>Unity Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd v Rocco Pezzano Pty
Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 38</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20154%20ALR%20361" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 154 ALR 361.</a>
<P>

575  	I accordingly find that Malco is entitled to succeed against
Prevwreck on the basis of claim (i) in its cross-claim.
<P>

576  	I have based this conclusion on my findings that Malco breached
an implied term of reasonable fitness implied in the contract
for the hire of
the forklift under either s71(2) of the <i>Trade Practices Act</i> or under the
common law.  No submissions were addressed to me on whether the forklift was
not of merchantable quality under the definition
of "merchantable quality" in
s66(2) of the <i>Trade Practices Act</i> and I make no finding on this
matter.
<P>

577  	Having decided that Malco is entitled to succeed on claim (i),
it is not really necessary for me to determine claims (iii)
and (iv). However,
I propose to express some views.
<P>

578  	Both of these claims were based on a representation allegedly
made by Prevwreck that the forklift was of a reasonable standard
and quality.
It was not suggested that any express representation to this effect had been
made by Prevwreck. It was alleged that
"this representation arose by
implication from conduct and was passive; <b>Given v Pryor</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1919/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 39 FLR
437</a> at 441".  This same sentence was repeated a number of times in Malco's
lengthy written submissions in support of claims made under
the <i>Trade
Practices</i><b> </b><i>Act</i>.  The sentence would appear to have been taken,
with only minor changes, from the first sentence of para [1.53.30] of the 1999
edition
of Miller's <i>Annotated Trade Practices Act</i><b>.</b>
<P>

579  	<b>Given v Pryor</b> is a very early decision on the <i>Trade
Practices Act</i> by Franki J (his Honour's decision was upheld on appeal to
the Full Court of the Federal Court but the decision of the Full Court
was not
referred to in Malco's submissions). In <b>Given v Pryor</b> the defendants had
been prosecuted for making a misleading "statement" (or being knowingly
concerned in the making of a misleading
statement) by means of a television
advertisement concerning the use to which certain land was capable of being put
or might lawfully
be put. Unsurprisingly, Franki J held that pictures contained
in the television advertisement showing parts of the land and several
houses
were, together with the words spoken in the advertisement, part of any
"statement" made in the advertisement.
<P>

580  	It can be seen immediately that <b>Given v Pryor</b> is very
different on its facts from the present case.  Furthermore, the pictures
contained in the television advertisement were found
by Franki J to form part
of an express, and not an implied, statement or representation. At p 441, which
is the page cited by counsel
for Malco, Franki J referred to<b><i>
</i>Halsbury's Laws of England</b> (3rd ed) vol 26 paras 1529 to 1530 as
follows:-
<P>

"In pars. 1529 and 1530 it is said in relation to <u>express</u> (my emphasis)
representations: `The usual permanent symbols by which a representation is
conveyed are words and figures written or
printed or produced by any other
equivalent means; but plans and drawings, maps, pictures and photographs and
the like, may serve
the same purpose and quite as effectually. Speech is the
most ordinary method for the communication of a statement not in writing,
but
gestures and demeanour may supplement spoken language, or even stand in its
place.' "
<P>

581  	It is true that at p 441 Franki J also said that a
representation can be implied from conduct, which is hardly a novel
proposition.
<P>

582  	No case other than <i>Given v Pryor</i> was cited for or
against the claims made under s 53(a) and s 52 of the <i>Trade Practices
Act</i>. There was no reference by any counsel to authorities on when silence
can be regarded as amounting to a representation.
<P>

583  	Insofar as there was any indication by counsel for Malco of
what was the conduct from which the alleged representation was
implied, counsel
referred to evidence about the instant transaction and evidence by Mr Moore
about alleged previous transactions
between Malco and Prevwreck.  I have
already stated my finding that Mr Moore's evidence lacked credibility.
<P>

584  	I do not consider that in this preliminary judgment I should
determine claims (iii) and (iv).
<P>

585  	However, Malco's claim against Prevwreck succeeds on claim
(i).
<P>

<b>Cross-claims by Malco against Lift Truck Services and Liftqip</b>
<P>

586  	As I have found that Malco is entitled to be indemnified by
Prevwreck because of breaches by Prevwreck of a term implied in
the contract
for the hire of the forklift from Prevwreck to Malco under s 71(2) of the
<i>Trade Practices Act</i> and at common law, it is not strictly necessary to
determine the cross-claims brought by Malco against Lift Truck Services and
Liftqip.
<P>

587  	In counsel for Malco's final submissions Malco's cross-claim
against Lift Truck Services was put in two ways, namely:-
<P>

(i)	A claim which depended upon Lift Truck Services being the owner of the
forklift and being liable to the plaintiff by reason
of a statutory agency
under s 53 of the <i>Motor</i><b> </b><i>Accidents Act</i>. For reasons I have
already given, I reject this claim.
<P>

(ii)	A claim that Lift Truck Services breached a duty of care it owed to the
plaintiff or to Malco. This claim was not the subject
of any detailed
submissions and I would not propose to deal with it, at least in this
preliminary judgment.
<P>

588  	In counsel for Malco's final submissions Malco's cross-claim
against Liftqip was put in the following ways:-
<P>

(i)	A claim which depended on Liftqip being the owner of the forklift and being
liable to the plaintiff by reason of a statutory
agency under s 53 of the
<i>Motor Accidents Act</i>. I reject this claim.
<P>

(ii)	A claim that Liftqip breached a duty of care it owed to the plaintiff or
to Malco. As in the case of Lift Truck Services, I
would not propose to deal
with this claim, at least in this preliminary judgment.
<P>

(iii)	A claim that Liftqip had breached implied terms of a contract alleged to
have existed between Liftqip and Malco. It was submitted
that I should find
that there was a contract between Liftqip and Malco for the hire of the
forklift, Prevwreck acting as the agent
of each of Liftqip and Malco in the
formation of the contract.  This claim is, of course, inconsistent with the
claims made in the
cross-claim by Malco against Prevwreck that there was a
contract for the hire of the forklift between Prevwreck and Malco.  On the
evidence, I am satisfied that there was no such contract between Liftqip and
Malco but rather two separate contracts for the hiring
of the forklift, one
contract between Liftqip and Prevwreck and another contract between Prevwreck
and Malco. This claim fails.
<P>

(iv)	Claims under s 53(a) and s 52 of the <i>Trade Practices Act</i>. As in the
case of the cross-claim brought by Malco against Prevwreck, it was alleged that
the cross-defendant, in this case Liftqip,
made a representation that the
forklift was of a reasonable standard and quality. Once again it was submitted
that "this representation
arose by implication from conduct and was passive
<b>Given v Pryor</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1919/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 39 FLR 437</a>, 441". I am satisfied that no such
representation was made by or on behalf of Liftqip on which Malco can rely and
this claim fails.
<P>

<b>Cross-claim by Prevwreck against Lift Truck Services and Liftqip</b>
<P>

589  	As put in counsel for Prevwreck's final submissions,
Prevwreck's cross-claim was put in three ways:-
<P>

(i)	A claim for contribution or indemnity between tortfeasors.
<P>

(ii)	Claims in contract.
<P>

(iii)	Claims under s 53(a) and s 52 of the <i>Trade Practices Act</i>.
<P>

590  	The submissions made by counsel for Prevwreck were brief and
would appear to have been copied from corresponding submissions
made against
Prevwreck by counsel for Malco.
<P>

591  	As to (ii), there was a contract for the hire of the forklift
from Liftqip to Prevwreck. Terms in accordance with s 71 of
the<b><i>
</i></b><i>Trade Practices</i><b> </b><i>Act</i> would not be implied in the
contract for hire between Liftqip and Prevwreck, because on the evidence
Prevwreck was not "a consumer".
Prevwreck did not fall within the definition of
"consumer" in s 4B(1)(a) of the <i>Trade Practices Act,</i> because Prevwreck
did acquire the forklift for the purpose of resupply. However, a condition of
reasonable fitness would be implied
in the contract at common law. This
condition was breached and the liability incurred by Prevwreck to Malco would
be a loss recoverable
by Prevwreck, from Liftqip, Liftqip being aware that
Prevwreck was going to on-hire the forklift.  In my opinion, Prevwreck is
entitled
to succeed in its cross-claim against Liftqip on this basis.  The
other bases of the cross-claim were not the subject of any detailed
submissions, or really any submissions at all, and I would not propose to deal
with them, at least in this preliminary judgment.
<P>

<b>Cross-claims by Skilled</b>
<P>

592  	I would not propose in this preliminary judgment to deal with
the cross-claims by Skilled (apart from the cross-claim against
Malco, and the
part of the fifth cross-claim which asserted a statutory agency under s53 of
the <i>Motor Accidents Act,</i> which I have already dealt with).
