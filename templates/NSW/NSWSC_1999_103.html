<P>

<b>  cross claim)</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  By amended notice of motion filed in court on 10 December
1998 the plaintiff seeks firstly an order pursuant to Division 3 of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b> that the time within which the plaintiff may commence
proceedings against Saxon Pty Limited ACN 002 638 342 be extended up to and
including 24 December 1998 and secondly that Saxon Pty Limited be joined as a
defendant in these proceedings.  The first defendant
filed a notice of motion
in court seeking that the first defendant have leave to file a cross claim
against the second defendant
and Saxon Pty Limited claiming contribution.  The
orders sought were not opposed.
<P>

2	For the purpose of these applications I find the following facts.
<P>

 (1)	On 27 May 1994 the plaintiff in the course of his employment with the
first defendant was injured when a welder named as Abdul

<P>

Bassal commenced welding whilst the plaintiff was filling a water pump with
petrol resulting in an explosion.  It was believed that
the welder was an
employee of the second defendant.
<P>

(2)	A statement of claim was issued on 19 August 1996 naming Atlantic Civil Pty
Limited (Atlantic Civil) as the second defendant.
 The first defendant Belmadar
Constructions Pty Limited is the employer of the plaintiff.  
<P>

(3)	On 23 September 1996 Mr Albert Bassal a former director of Saxon telephoned
the plaintiff's solicitor.  At that time the plaintiff's
solicitor was aware
that Saxon Pty Limited had been deregistered on 13 June 1996.  Mr Bassal said
words to the following effect "My
brother Abdul Bassal was not employed by
Saxon Welding but by his own private company which was, like Saxon Pty Limited,
a subcontractor
of Atlantic Civil.  Saxon Pty Limited did not have any public
liability insurance as that company and Atlantic Civil were both, as
it were,
joint subcontractors with Belmadar Constructions Pty Limited".
<P>

(4)	On 24 September 1996 Mr Abdul Bassal (the welder) telephoned the
plaintiff's solicitor and said that when he was working at
the site at Prospect
Reservoir on the Water Board job in May 1994 he did not have a private company.
He said that he was employed
either by Atlantic Civil Pty Limited or by Saxon
Welding, that those two companies were in it together and he thought he was
paid
sometimes by Atlantic Civil and sometimes by Saxon Welding.
<P>

(5)	The plaintiff's solicitor was left in doubt as to whether the employer of
the welder was Atlantic Civil Pty Limited or Saxon
Pty Limited.  After the
plaintiff ascertained that the insurance policy of Atlantic Civil Pty Limited
did not cover Saxon Pty Limited
and he had known that Saxon Pty Limited was in
liquidation, he applied to the court to have Saxon Pty Limited restored to the
register.
 The plaintiff's solicitor subsequently ascertained that Saxon Pty
Limited had been restored to the register by the Australian Securities
and
Investments Commission on 17 December 1997.
<P>

(6)	On 18 November 1998 a copy of this motion was served on Saxon Pty Limited
by forwarding copies to the company's registered office
at Suite 302, 3rd Floor
161 Bigge Street Liverpool.  The amended motion was also served on 11 December
1998 in the same manner.
<P>

(7)	On 3 February 1999 the plaintiff's solicitor again wrote to Saxon Pty
Limited asking them to acknowledge receipt of the documents.
 On 8 February
1999 Greg Peel a chartered accountant at that address wrote to the plaintiff's
solicitor and said that he no longer
acted on behalf of the company and had not
done so for the past 5 years.  The plaintiff's solicitor telephoned Mr Peel's
office and
was advised that all the documents in his two letters had been 
<P>

received and forwarded to the director of Saxon Pty Limited, Mr Albert Bassal
of Lot 1A Campbelltown Road Denham Court New South
Wales.  There was no
appearance by Mr Bassal when this matter was heard.
<P>

3	I turn now to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a>.  Section 60C and E fall within subdivision
2 of the Act which is defined as the secondary limitation period.  Subdivision
2 applies
only to causes of action that accrue on or after 1 September 1990 ( -
see s 60B).  
<P>

4	Section 60C provides:
<P>

	<b>"Ordinary action (including surviving action)</b>
<P>

<b>60C(1)	This section applies to a cause of action, founded on negligence,
nuisance or breach of duty, for damages for personal injury,
but does not apply
to a cause of action arising under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ctra1897288/" class="autolink_findacts">Compensation to Relatives Act
1897</a>.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	If an application is made to a court by a person claiming to have a
cause of action to which this section applies, the court,
after hearing such of
the persons likely to be affected by the application as it sees fit, may, if it
decides that it is just and
reasonable to do so, order that the limitation
period for the cause of action be extended for such period, not exceeding 5
years,
as it determines."</b>
<P>

5	Section 60E provides:
<P>

<b>	"Matters to be considered by the court</b>
<P>

<b>60E(1)	In exercising the powers conferred on it by section 60C or 60D, a
court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case,
and (without
affecting the generality of the foregoing), the court is, to the extent that
they are relevant to the circumstances
of the case, to have regard to the
following:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the length of and reasons for the delay;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the extent to which, having regard to the delay, there is or may be
prejudice to the defendant by reason that evidence that would
have been
available if the proceedings had been commenced within the limitation period is
no longer available;</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	the time at which the injury became known to the plaintiff;</b>
<P>

<b>(d)	the time at which the nature and extent of the injury became known to
the plaintiff;</b>
<P>

<b>(e)	the time at which the plaintiff became aware of a connection between the
injury and the defendant's act or omission;  </b>
<P>

<b>(f)	any conduct of the defendant which induced the plaintiff to delay
bringing the action;</b>
<P>

<b>(g)	the steps (if any) taken by the plaintiff to obtain medical, legal or
other expert advice and the nature of any such advice the
plaintiff may have
received;</b>
<P>

<b>(h)	the extent of the plaintiff's injury or loss."</b>
<P>

6	In relation to ss 60C and 60E of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b> Mason P in
<b><u>The Council of City of Sydney v Zegarac</u></b> (Court of Appeal, 3
September 1997, unreported) referred to propositions which were
uncontroversial.  They are: 
<P>

(1)	Section 60C confers a judicial discretion.  
<P>

(2)	The discretion is a discretion to grant, not a discretion to refuse, an
extension of the primary limitation period.  The court
must be satisfied that
it is "just and reasonable" to make the order for extension.  
<P>

(3)	In exercising the discretion, the court is required "to have regard to all
the circumstances of the case" (s 60E(1)).  It is
also required to have regard
to the 8 factors listed in s 60E(1) "to the extent that they are relevant to
the circumstances of the
case".  
<P>

(4)	Among those circumstances to which a court must have regard are the
rationales for the existence of limitation periods which
were identified in
those passages from the Attorney General's second reading speech that are set
out in the order judgments, and
which McHugh J discusses in <b><u>Brisbane
South</u></b>.  
<P>

(5)	Since s 60C creates a judicial discretion appellate review is restricted by
well known principles.  Mason P then says that beyond
this there are more
debatable areas of application of <b><u>Brisbane South</u></b>.
<P>

7	Justice Powell in <b><u>Zegarac</u></b> stated that these three things may be
said about s 60C and s 60E.  He agreed with proposition 3 expounded by Mason P.
Powell JA's
other two propositions were firstly that an order extending the
limitation period may only be made when it appears, in the light
of all the
circumstances of the case, including those set out in s 60E(1) of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b> 1969, that it is just and reasonable so to do and
secondly although a prospective defendant may be subject to an evidentiary onus
to raise any consideration telling against the exercise of the discretion to
extend the limitation period, the ultimate onus of satisfying
the court that,
in all the circumstances of the case, it is just and reasonable that an order
may be made lies on the applicant.
<P>

8	I turn to consider the matters listed in s 60E(1).  In relation to s
60E(1)(a) the length of the delay between the expiration
of the limitation
period and the application to extend application is about 18 months.  The
solicitor became aware that Mr Bassal
may have been employed by an entity other
than the first defendant in September 1996 which was prior to the expiration of
the limitation
period.  He did not file an application to join Saxon Pty
Limited until December 1998.  The plaintiff's solicitor did not act
expeditiously.
<P>

9	
<P>

In relation to s 60E(1)(b) the proposed third defendant has not sought to be
heard as to whether it would suffer prejudice.  It
has not been established
that any evidence that would have been available if the proceedings had been
commenced within the limitation
period is no longer available.
<P>

10	In relation of s 60E(1)(c) and (d) the plaintiff knew the time at which the
injury became known to the plaintiff and the time
at which the nature and
extent of the injury became known to the plaintiff at the time of the accident
or shortly afterwards.
<P>

11	In relation to s 60E(1)(e) and (f), although the plaintiff knew the name of
the welder, Mr Abdul Bassal.  The plaintiff's solicitor
did not know whether he
was employed by Atlantic Civil or Saxon Pty Limited at the time of the
accident.  Mr Albert Bassal (Mr Abdul
Bassal's brother) pointed to a third
possibility, namely Mr Abdul Bassal's private company.  The director of Saxon
Pty Limited is
Albert Bassal.  It was the director of Saxon Pty Limited who
provided the information which is in conflict with his brother's statement
as
to the correct employer.  It may serve Mr Albert Bassal's interests to deny
that his company was his brother's employer.
<P>

12	In relation to s 60E(g) and (h), the plaintiff has obtained gross burns to
the arms, legs and genitalia involving 40% of his
body surface.  In January
1995 the plaintiff returned to work on light duties and reduced hours.  It
appears that he continues to
work on this basis.  The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/index.html#p33" class="autolink_findacts">Part 33</a> particulars claim
that he will incur substantial future medcial expenses.  The plaintiff's
injuries are serious and the claim for
damages, if successful, is a substantial
one.
<P>

13	I have taken into account the eight factors listed in S 60E(1) as discussed
earlier in this judgment.  I accept that presumptive
prejudice has occurred in
the delay in joining the proposed third defendant.  I am not satisfied that
there has been actual prejudice.
 However, I am not satisfied that these
matters establish that the proposed third defendant's chances of a fair trial
are unlikely
or that it will suffer significant prejudice.
<P>

14	It is my view that the plaintiff has discharged his onus and I am satisfied
that it is just and reasonable that an order should
be made that he be granted
an extension of the limitation period.
<P>

15	It is also appropriate that the first defendant be entitled to file a cross
claim seeking indemnity from the second and proposed
third defendants and I
make such an order.  The order for costs in relation to these motions are that
costs be costs in the cause.
<P>

16	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff is granted an extension of time within which to commence
proceedings against Saxon Pty Limited ACN 002 638 342
up to and including 8
March 1999.
<P>

(2)	Leave is given to the plaintiff to join Saxon Pty Limited as a third
defendant in these proceedings.  An amended statement of
claim is to be filed
and served by 8 March 1999.
<P>

(3)	The first defendant is given leave to file a cross claim, such cross claim
is to be filed and served by 22 March 1999.
<P>

(4)	Costs of the motions be costs in the cause.
