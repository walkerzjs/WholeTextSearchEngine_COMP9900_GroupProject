<b>FRIDAY, 12 MARCH 1999</b>
<P>

<b>12152/91   -   ALAN JAMES FOSTER  v  </b>
<P>

<b>PROSPECT COUNTY COUNCIL</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Personal injury - electric shock)</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  The plaintiff who was employed by the defendant as a linesman
seeks damages for personal injuries he suffered in an accident which
occurred
at work on 2 July 1990.  Liability is in issue.  At the hearing the plaintiff,
his wife Winifred Ann Foster, Dr Craft, Dr
Pauline Langekluddecke and Mr Warner
gave evidence and were cross examined.  The defendant has cross claimed against
CIC Insurance
Limited (cross defendant) seeking indemnity.  The cross defendant
has filed a second cross claim against the defendant seeking contribution.
 
<P>

2	The plaintiff was born on 7 March 1960 and was aged 30 years at the time of
the accident.  He is now 39 years old.  The plaintiff's
solicitor is taking
steps to have the Protective Commissioner appointed to manage the plaintiff's
affairs.  The verdict moneys are
to be paid into court pending the appointment
of the Protective Commissioner.
<P>

3	I shall refer firstly to liability;  secondly to whether the Motor Accident
Act or the Workers Compensation Act applies;  thirdly
to the plaintiff's
history prior to the accident;  fourthly to the plaintiff's condition and work
history after the accident;  fifthly
to non-economic loss;  sixthly to past and
future economic loss including superannuation;  seventhly to care both past and
future
and respite care;  eighthly to future medical expenses and lastly to
fund management, <b>Fox v Wood</b> and out-of-pocket expenses and costs.  
<P>

<b><u>Liability and contributory negligence</u></b>
<P>

4	I turn to the issue of liability.  The plaintiff was employed by the
defendant as a linesman.  On 2 July 1990 an emergency officer
employed by the
defendant discovered that the traffic lights at the corner of Briens and Kliens
Roads Northmead (the accident site)
were not working.  He discovered that the A
phase fuse on the eastern low voltage feeder from substation No 6 in Kliens
Road had
failed.   The emergency officer fixed the fuse and left it hanging
down in the open position.  That officer left the work site at
2.25 pm before
the district line crew arrived.  A dispatch officer called a district line crew
to the site to replace the broken
cross arm on the power pole.   The work group
leader was Mr Norman Lidbury and the crew comprised lineworkers Mr Peter Warner
and
the plaintiff and electricity workers Mr Peter Jacques and Mr Robert Scott.
When the crew arrived on the site the traffic lights
were out.  The work group
leader was not informed that the B and C fuses were live, hence the other
workers were also unaware that
these phase fuses were live.
<P>

5	
<P>

In his statement dated 26 July 1990, Mr Warner stated that upon his arrival at
the accident scene at approximately 2.50pm he noticed
that the cross arm of the
low voltage pole at the corner of Kliens and Briens Roads, south eastern side,
was broken.  Mr Warner and
Peter Jacques a linesman's assistant set up the pole
platform on the elevated work platform vehicle (EPV - commonly known as a
cherrypicker).
 Mr Warner climbed up the ladder onto the pole chair with a set
of test lamps and checked the phases to see if they were live.  The
type of
tester used by the defendant's employees was a lamp tester, which normally
consists of two 240 volt low-wattage incandescent
lamps connected in series
between the two test terminals.  The use of two lamps allows either 240 volts
or 415 volts to be tested.
 A glowing light bulb would have indicated that
there is voltage between the terminals tested.  After getting no indication
ie.,
the lamps did not light up, Mr Warner passed the test lamps down to Norm
Lidbury a leading hand linesman who went to test the lamps
at another location
across the road.  Mr Lidbury in his statement dated 26 July 1990 stated that he
went over to a shop and tested
the test lamps to prove they worked and got a
glow.  
<P>

6	Mr Lidbury came back to the site and told Mr Warner that the lines were okay.
He requested that Mr Warner and the plaintiff go
ahead and change the cross
arm.  The test lamps were not proof tested before being used on the overhead
wires to test for voltage.
 The cross arm was taken up with an EPV (see
photographs Ex A).  The bucket of the EPV was insulated with fibreglass as was
the arm
on the EPV.  The 
<P>

plaintiff was in the bucket on the EPV which was positioned almost level with
the conductors.  There was no evidence that the plaintiff
wore protective
clothing and gloves nor that there were insulating covers on the conductors.
<P>

7	At about 2.45 pm, Mr Warner proceeded to drill a hole through the pole
approximately 50 mm below the old cross arm whilst standing
between the A and B
phases at about chest height.  After drilling the hole Mr Warner mounted a new
cross arm with the assistance
of the plaintiff who was working in the bucket.
Mr Warner started to transfer the neutral and A phases over to the new cross
arm
whilst the plaintiff transferred the C phase conductor to the new cross arm
and proceeded to cut a section of the old cross arm close
to B phase.  Mr
Warner was having some difficulty attempting to transfer B phase.  The
plaintiff attempted to assist Mr Warner. 
The plaintiff leant over the C phase
to reach the B phase and made contact between the B and C phase conductors.
There is no evidence
as to the distance between the plaintiff's body which was
in the bucket and the low voltage wires at the time of the accident.  
<P>

8	Mr Warner then realised that the plaintiff was in difficulty and knocked him
clear.  The plaintiff fell back into the bucket.
 Mr Warner called to Bob Scott
the plant operator to get the plaintiff down and Mr Warner proceeded to climb
down the ladder.  The
plaintiff was unconscious.  The plaintiff's workmates
gave him mouth to mouth resuscitation and heart massage for at least 4 minutes.
An ambulance arrived, the plaintiff was given oxygen and transported to
hospital.
<P>

9	
<P>

After the accident, the condition of the lamps used by Mr Warner was checked
twice in the normal manner and found not to be working.
 After a close
inspection of the lamp used by Mr Warner was made and checked by Mr Lidbury, it
was discovered that the globe on the
series side of the switch had a filament
broken and as the 2 globes are in series, the lamp would not work (Ex B p
4).
<P>

10	Not long after the accident the defendant requested that an additional test
be performed on the lamps to test for a current.
 Different equipment with a
buzzer and a light were used to test the current (t 193).  
<P>

11	The plaintiff submitted that the defendant failed to provide a safe system
of work;  failed to provide some safe plant and appliances;
 failed to switch
off the current in all power lines within reasonable proximity of the area
where the plaintiff was working so as
to prevent him accidentally touching a
live power line;  failed to warn the plaintiff of the location of all power
lines which contained
electric current at the time when he was performing his
work and of the necessity to avoid them and failed to supervise the plaintiff
and instruct him adequately at all times as to the dangers which he faced and
the possibility of injury and the emergency officer
did not communicate or
caused to be communicated to the work crew that the fuses were live.  In
addition the plaintiff submitted
that the defendant failed to comply with
Regulations 16, 21, 22, 23, 30 and 34 (ii)(c) of the <b>Overhead Line (Workers)
Regulations</b> 1964 and clauses 4.4 and 4.5 of the <b>Electrical Safety
Rules</b>.  
<P>

12	The defendant submitted that firstly the work involved danger;  secondly the
normal procedures were carried out by the defendant's
employees;  thirdly that
if there was a fault in the test lamp, the testing method adopted was not
foolproof and fourthly the risk
of injury was not foreseeable.
<P>

13	I turn to the issue of negligence. The defendant investigated the accident
and determined that the replacement of the cross arm
could have been carried
out by one of two methods, firstly by isolating supply and danger tagging the
isolation points in accordance
with Rule 4.5 of the defendant's <b>Electrical
Safety Rules</b> and secondly by using the live line method in accordance with
Regulation 22 of the <b>Overhead Line (Workers) Regulations</b>. Clause 4.5 of
the defendant's <b>Electrical Safety Rules</b> provide that when low and medium
voltage mains and apparatus are to be made not alive to enable work to be
carried out such mains
and apparatus shall be isolated from all possible
sources of supply and proved not alive.  
<P>

14	The defendant determined the accident was caused by non-compliance with
Regulation 22 of the <b>Overhead Line (Workers) Regulations</b> and by
non-compliance with Clause 4.4 of the defendant's <b>Electrical Safety
Rules</b>.  The report also pointed out that an assumption was made by the crew
that the mains were not alive and no attempt was made to check
isolations and
secure these isolations by placing district danger tags.
<P>

15	The plaintiff tendered a report of Associate Professor T R Blackburn of the
School of Engineering at the University of New South
Wales.  The defendant did
not rely on such a report and Associate Professor Blackburn was not cross
examined.  According to Associate
Professor Blackburn, the test lamp was faulty
in that one of the lamps had a broken filament.  This would have prevented any
glow
in the lamps whether there was voltage present or not, because the two
lamps were connected in series and the broken filament meant
a break in the
continuity of the test circuit.  The report concludes that phases B and C were
obviously live and therefore the plaintiff
must have sustained a voltage of 415
volts across his arm, between the armpit and the hand.  Despite the relatively
limited spacing
of the contact points on one arm, the effect of the current
flow would have covered the whole body because of the electrical conductivity
of the blood system.  Mr Warner's uncontested evidence supports this view as he
stated that the touching of two phases at one time
created a circuit (t 190).
Associate Professor Blackburn says that the electric current would have
affected the plaintiff's heart
action and cause ventricular fibrillation with
consequent loss of blood circulation.  
<P>

16	According to the report of Associate Professor Blackburn the primary cause
of the accident was the failure of the test instrument
to detect that the
conductors were live.  He says that the tester was not fault proof.  It is his
opinion that had the test unit
been tested both immediately before and
immediately after its use on the pole, it would have reduced considerably the
possibility
of the tester being seen as satisfactory in its condition with a
broken filament.  However he is not certain that if testing was
done before and
after its use on the pole, the test results would have differed.  He identified
other deficiencies namely that there
was a lack of communication in that the
emergency services officer did not inform the crew either directly or
indirectly that the
lines of phases B and C were not isolated at the substation
whereas A was.
<P>

17	Associate Professor Blackburn stated that had the plaintiff been wearing
insulating gloves or long sleeves of a clothing material
which had some
insulating properties the accident may not have occurred but he acknowledged
that as the test indicated that the conductors
were not live, the plaintiff and
Mr Warner did not have any reason to resort to such measures.
<P>

18	Nor did he think that the EPV (cherry picker) played a role in the accident.
According to Associate Professor Blackburn it was
immaterial whether the bucket
was earthed or not because the current flow path did not involve any earth
connection.  The plaintiff's
arm made contact with two separate phases and thus
the current flow which caused the shock was able to flow from one phase
conductor
to another via the plaintiff's body without requiring any earth
connection.  I accept Associate Professor Blackburn's opinion as
outlined
above.
<P>

19	In relation to the lack of communication, if the emergency officer had
communicated with the district line crew, the accident
would not have occurred.
However, there were procedures in place that the crew was supposed to follow.
They were to test for whether
the phases were live.  If the phases were live,
then an employee's body (excluding his or her arms) were not to come within 0.6
metres
of a conductor of live low voltage wire unless the conductors were
permanently or temporarily covered with insulating material. 
Where the
employee was working aloft, if the conductor was not permanently or temporarily
insulated, then the employee had to wear
at least one insulating glove.  In
these circumstances the emergency or dispatch officer, in failing to notify the
crew that the
B and C phases were live, would not have foreseen that his 
<P>

or her conduct involved a risk of injury to the emergency crew of which the
plaintiff was a member.  The lack of communication between
the emergency
officer and the crew does not, in my view give rise to a finding of
negligence.
<P>

20	It must be remembered that working with electricity is inherently dangerous.
However, does the failure by the defendant to test
the lamps both before and
after being used on the conductor constitute negligence?  There is no doubt
that the defendant considered
that testing the lamps before and after being
used on a conductor was important.  It has put into place a specific safety
rule on
this topic.  Clause 4.4 of the defendant's <b>Electrical Safety
Rules</b> provides that low and medium voltage mains and apparatus shall be
proved not alive by means of approved test lamps, voltmeters, or
other approved
equipment.  This test equipment shall be proven to be in good working order
immediately before and after use by testing
a known "live" circuit.  The
testing of the test lamps to be done both before and after testing has taken
place on a live circuit.
 This rule does not distinguish between high and low
voltage overhead lines.  The work group leader did not ensure that the test
lamps were pre-tested and he should have done so.  The defendant did not comply
with this safety rule as it did not cause a test
to be carried out on the lamps
prior to using it to test the current.  The defendant's investigation cited
non-compliance with this
rule as a cause of the accident.
<P>

21	I have also accepted Associate Professor Blackburn's view when he stated
that had the test been conducted immediately before
and after use on the pole,
it would have reduced considerably the possibility of the tester as being seen
as satisfactory in its
condition with the broken filament.  It is my view that
had the lamps been tested to see if they were working prior to them being
used
to test whether the conductor was live, it is more probable than not that it
would have become apparent that the tester was
not working properly.  
<P>

22	It is reasonably foreseeable that if a low voltage lamp was not tested
before and after use on the conductor it could not be
ascertained whether the
lamps were working properly.  This created a real risk of injury to the
plaintiff.  The magnitude of the
risk cannot be said to be far fetched or
fanciful.  As a response to the risk the defendant could have used different
equipment,
namely testing equipment that consists of both a lamp and a buzzer.
If a filament in the globe was broken, a buzzer would alert employees
that
there was a live current.  Alternatively, the plaintiff's employer could have
required the plaintiff to wear an insulating glove
and/or protective clothing.
These are a relatively inexpensive and practical steps that could have been
taken in response to the
risk.  The buzzer and lamp tester was used by the
defendant some time after the accident occurred.  The defendant breached the
duty
of care owed to the plaintiff.  This breach of duty of care caused him to
be electrocuted and suffer serious injuries.
<P>

23	It was not submitted that contributory negligence should be attributed to
the plaintiff.  In any event, the plaintiff had been
told by his supervisor
that the circuit was not live and he carried out his tasks in accordance with
that direction.  Hence, no contributory
negligence should be apportioned to the
plaintiff.  
<P>

24	
<P>

I turn to consider whether there were breaches of the statutory duties referred
to earlier in this judgment.  In s 37(1) of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_act/ea1945139/" class="autolink_findacts">Electricity Act</a></b> 1945
(formerly known as the Electricity Development Act) (the <b>Act</b>) enables
the Governor to make regulations in relation to the safety of persons employed
by electricity supply authorities in connection
with the generation,
transmission, distribution or supply of electricity or of persons engaged in
the installation of electric wires,
cables, appliances, meters, fittings,
insulators or apparatus in, on, under or over any place or premises whatsoever.
The regulations
in pursuance of the <b>Act</b> in force at the time of the
accident were the <b>Overhead Line (Workers) Regulations</b>.  These
regulations were repealed on 28 August 1992.  The <b>Overhead Line (Workers)
Regulations</b> are intended to cover persons employed by the electricity
supply authorities such as the plaintiff and electricity supply authorities
such as the defendant.  The plaintiff was working on low voltage lines as
defined in Regulation 6 of the <b>Overhead Line (Workers) Regulations</b>.  The
purpose of the regulations are to ensure the safety of these employees when
working with electricity.
<P>

25	Regulation 16 of the <b> Overhead Line (Workers) Regulations</b> 1964 states
that an employee shall wear suitable protective clothing while working within
0.6 metres of a conductor of a low voltage
line.  This regulation creates an
obligation upon the employee not the employer.  Hence it does not appear that
the defendant breached
this regulation.
<P>

26	Regulation 21 states that an employee shall not pass between the conductors
of a live low voltage overhead line at any point
where the conductors are
spaced less than 1.2 metres apart unless the conductors immediately next to his
body are permanently insulated
or temporarily covered with suitable insulating
material provided by the employer, a distance of 0.6 metres in each direction
from
the point nearest to the employee's body on each conductor.  This
regulation creates an obligation on the employee not on the employer
not to
pass between the conductors of live low voltage less than 1.2 metres apart
unless they are insulated, albeit there is an obligation
on behalf of the
employer to provide suitable insulating material.  The defendant has not
breached this regulation.
<P>

27	Regulation 22 states that an employer shall not permit or require an
employee to, and an employee shall not, work aloft on, or
within 0.6 metres of,
any conductor of a live low voltage overhead line unless any part of a
conductor (except the conductor on which
he is working) within 0.6 metres of
any part of the employee's body other than his arms is permanently insulated or
temporarily covered
with suitable insulating material provided by the employer;
or the employee wears at least one insulating glove and occupies such
a
position that no part of his body, other than his forearms, is at or above the
level of any conductor of the live line which is
within 0.6 metres of any part
of his body other than his arms and which is not permanently insulated or
temporarily covered with
suitable insulating material provided by the employer.
For the purpose of this regulation, if the work to be carried out is work
of an
operational nature the bare live parts of low voltage fuses or links need not
be temporarily covered with insulating material
if the employee wears at least
one insulating glove.  This regulation creates an absolute statutory duty on
the employer.  The plaintiff's
body was not permanently insulated or
temporarily covered with suitable insulating material nor was he wearing at
least one insulating
glove.  The plaintiff was working within 0.6 metres when
he leant his arms and body over to reach the B phase.  The defendant in
its own
investigation cited that the accident and the plaintiff's injuries were caused
by non-compliance with this regulation.  The
duty was an absolute one.  The
employer through its employees breached this regulation.
<P>

28	Regulation 23 provides that where a low voltage overhead line has been
isolated from all sources of supply to permit the carrying
out of work the
employer shall not authorise the work to be commenced unless such line has been
tested and proved that it is not
alive.  The A phase of the overhead line had
been isolated from all services of supply.  However, the B and C phases were
not.  The
duty on the employer is an absolute one.  The line was not proved
"not alive".  The defendant has breached this statutory duty.
<P>

29	Regulation 30 provides that test equipment be checked to prove operation
both before and after use on an unknown circuit.  This
regulation appears in
Part V of the Regulations which is headed "High Voltage Overhead Lines" and
appears to relate to high voltage
overhead lines.  The plaintiff was working on
low voltage lines so this regulation does not apply to this situation.
<P>

30	Regulation 34 provides that the employer is required to provide low voltage
test lamps and these items are to be kept in good
repair and the employer shall
cause a check on the condition of the equipment at intervals not exceeding six
months.  The equipment
is checked every six 
<P>

months but not electrically tested.  However the employer had an absolute duty
to keep the voltage test lamp in good repair.  This
lamp was not working
properly.  It was not in good repair.  The defendant breached this statutory
duty.
<P>

31	In addition to the finding that the defendant was negligent, I am satisfied
that on the balance of probabilities the defendant
breached Regulations  22, 23
and 34 of the <b>Overhead Line (Workers) Regulations</b> 1964 and that the
plaintiff's injuries resulted from such breaches.  
<P>

<b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Accidents Act</a> or Workers Compensation Act</u>?</b>
<P>

32	At this stage it is convenient to determine whether the accident was a motor
accident within the meaning of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Accidents Act 1988</a></b>.  I have

Appeal (Powell JA with whom Mason P and Stein JA agreed) recently discussed
this topic in <b><u>Central West County Council v NSW Insurance Ministerial
Corporation &amp; Ors</u></b>;  <b><u>Warpeg Pty Limited v Central West County
Council</u></b> (unreported, 27 November 1998 at pp 33-39).  As in NRMA
Insurance, the relevant indemnity provision is set out in Schedule 1 of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Accidents Act 1988</a> (NSW) and reads:
<P>

	
<P>

<b>"The insurer insures the owner of the motor vehicle and any other person who

against liability in respect of the death of or injury to a person caused by

of the vehicle in the use or operation of the
vehicle in any part of the Commonwealth (whether or not on a public

<P>

33	In <b><u>Central West County Council</u></b>, Powell JA stated that he
accepted that the test posited by the words `arising out of' is wider than that
posited by the words `caused
by' and the former, although it involves some
causal or consequential relationship between the use of the vehicle and the
injuries,
does not require the direct or proximate relationship which would be
necessary to conclude that the injuries were caused by the use
of the motor
vehicle.  However, the authorities demonstrate that not all acts upon, or in
relation to a motor vehicle involve the
use of that motor vehicle.  In the case
before me it must be demonstrated that, at the relevant time, the elevated work
platform
vehicle was in use and that use caused the plaintiff's injury. His
Honour in <b><u>Central West County Council</u></b> analysed the reasoning of
Dixon CJ, Windeyer J and Menzies J in <b><u>Government Insurance Office of New
South Wales v King</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1960/60.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1960] HCA 60</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281960%29%20104%20CLR%2093" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1960) 104 CLR 93</a> and Meagher JA's interpretation of
Dixon CJ's reasoning in <b><u>Handford</u></b>.  His Honour referred to the
decisions of the High Court in <b><u>GIO of New South Wales v R J Green &amp;
Lloyd Pty Limited</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 6</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281965%29%20114%20CLR%20437" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1965) 114 CLR 437</a> and <b><u>Commercial &amp; General

JJ in the course of their judgment said:
<P>

	<b>"The wide scope of a policy in similar terms was emphasised by Barwick CJ
in <i>Green &amp; Lloyd</i>, when, in referring to the statute in question in
that case, he said:</b>
<P>

<b>	`...The <i>Act</i> is not limited to the use of a vehicle in or upon public
thoroughfares or to its use in movements:  and that in choosing the expression
`the use of the motor vehicle' as the basis for the requirement of a policy of
insurance and for the delimitation of the area of
indemnity to be obtained, the
<i>Act</i> indicates an intention to cover a very wide field, a field more
extensive than what might be called the traffic use of the motor
vehicle.'</b>
<P>

<b>	That passage was cited with approval by the Court in <i>Commercial &amp;
General Insurance</i>.</b>
<P>

<b>	Notwithstanding the breadth of the phrase which is suggested by these
principles, while conception of use of a vehicle is not without
limits related
to the character of the vehicle:  see <i>Harvey Trinder (NSW) Pty Limited v
Government Insurance Office (NSW)</i> ((1966) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=114%20CLR%20449" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">114 CLR 449)</a> and <i>Government

CJ said:</b>
<P>

<b>	`But there is in my opinion a distinction between using a car and putting
it in order for some subsequent use.  This broad distinction
may sometimes be
difficult to apply because so many things are incidental to or arise out of the
present use of a motor vehicle which
is isolated from the circumstance might
look as if the use of the vehicle had been abandoned or suspected for the
purpose of repairing
or adjusting it.  But it must always be kept in mind that
all the incidents attending the actual use of the vehicle form part of
its
use.'"</b>
<P>

34	In <b><u>NRMA Insurance</u></b> Clarke JA (with whom Priestley and Powell
JJA agreed) stated that the test by which it is determined whether indemnity is
afforded
under the terms of the policy involved three separate considerations
namely, firstly whether it has been established that the owner
or driver of the
vehicle is at fault - that is, to adopt the definition in s 3, whether the
evidence establishes that the owner or
driver was negligent or had committed
another tort?;  secondly if the first question is answered "Yes", whether the
fault of the
owner or driver caused the death of or injury to the person who
has claimed?;  and thirdly if the answer to the two preceding questions
is
"Yes", whether the fault of the owner or driver was "in the use or operation of
the vehicle".  Clarke JA stated obviously it is
not any fault of the owner or
driver which will enliven indemnity under the policy.  It is only the use or
operation of the vehicle
which will give rise to a right to indemnity.
<P>

35	and at page 9 Clarke JA continued:
<P>

	<b>"There remains the final question, whether the plaintiff's injuries were
caused by the owner's fault in the use of the vehicle?  That
is a question of
fact which cannot be resolved by the application of a simple test.  In some
cases it will be relatively clear whether
the fault was in the use of the
vehicle.  For instance, where the fault lies in the driving of a vehicle.
Again where an owner's
employee negligently secures a load on a truck so that
part of it falls off during a journey and injures another person it is clear
enough that the owner's fault would be `in the use or operation of the
vehicle'.  They are both cases where the negligence occurs
in the actual use of
the vehicle.  Where, however, the owner is negligent in some aspect of an
operation incidental to the actual
use, such as the loading, the position is
not so clear.  It is settled that `the incidents attending the actual </b>
<P>

<b>use of the vehicle form part of its use' (<i>Government Insurance Office of
New South Wales v King</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1960/60.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1960] HCA 60</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281960%2d61%29%20104%20CLR%2093" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1960-61) 104 CLR 93</a> at 96, per Dixon CJ) but it by
no means follows that negligence in the unloading of a vehicle is necessarily
`in the use of' that
vehicle.</b>
<P>

<b>	Thus, for instance, proof that an employer instituted an unsafe system of
unloading may or may not constitute negligence in the use
or operation of a
vehicle.  It will depend on the relationship between the negligent act or
omission and the vehicle.  If the negligence
lies in the unsafe placing of the
load on the tray of the trailer of an articulated vehicle it will, in general,
be correct to describe
the fault as in the use or operation of that vehicle.
Where the negligence relates to some part of the unloading procedure distant
from the vehicle then, as it seems to me, it would not be accurate to describe
the negligence in the same way.  These are again two
extreme situations and
there will almost certainly be other in which the position will not be so
clear."</b>
<P>

36	In <b><u>Zammitt</u></b>, Badgery-Parker J applied the test as stated by
Clarke JA in <b><u>NRMA Insurance</u></b>.
<P>

37	The defendant submitted that unless the electricity supply was isolated or
insulation procedures were adopted, working aloft
from the vehicle and in close
proximity to phases "B" and "C" created a position of danger - that danger
arising from the vehicle
placing the plaintiff in the position of danger.
According to the defendant, the zone could only ever be free of danger if,
before
the vehicle's elevation apparatus was activated and located, the source
of power was isolated or the conductors and associated equipment
insulated.
The defendant also submitted that this case involves the use of the vehicle (in
particular its vertical operations) 
<P>

in a zone in which the danger (or its source) had not been eliminated or
counteracted by insulation.  The defendant also submitted
that the vehicle was
in use as it was being employed for the purpose of both providing access and
enabling work to be undertaken
from it.
<P>

38	The part of the submission referring to the lack of insulation fails as the
evidence shows that the basket and the arm on the
EPV were insulated.  Even so,
according to the evidence it did not matter whether the bucket was earthed or
not because the current
flow did not involve any earth connection.  The EPV arm
and bucket was used by the defendant to permit its employees to gain access
to
the overhead wires.  That the evidence shows that the accident was caused by
the plaintiff leaning over causing his arm to touch
two phases at one time
which created a current flow this caused the electric shock to flow from one
phase wire to another via the
plaintiff's body without requiring any connection
with the cherrypicker.  It was the fault of the employer in using a tester lamp
which was not working properly.  This meant that the defendant's employees and
the plaintiff were told that the lines were not live
and adequate precautions
were not taken.  The live circuit came into contact with the plaintiff's arm.
The current then flowed through
the plaintiff's body causing serious injury.

<P>

39	It is my view that the injury was not caused by the fault of the
owner/driver of the motor vehicle in the use or operation of
a motor vehicle.
There was no fault in the fact that such vehicle was used in the way it was
used or operated.  The use and operation
of the vehicle were incidental to what
occurred.  The plaintiff might well have been working from a ladder or from a
pole chair.
 Getting the plaintiff to where the fault caused his injury is not
a fault in the use or operation of the elevated work platform
vehicle.  The
plaintiff's injury was not caused by a motor accident within the meaning of the
Act and that he is not an injured person
within the definition of that Act.  I
will assess damages pursuant to the <b>Workers Compensation Act</b> not the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Accidents Act</a></b>.  CIC is the defendant's motor vehicle (third party)
insurer.  As the indemnity is not enlivened under the policy CIC Insurance is
not liable to indemnify the defendant and both cross claims should be
dismissed.
<P>

<b><u>Damages</u></b>
<P>

40	I turn to give a history of the plaintiff and make some comments about the
plaintiff's evidence.  This history has been largely
provided by documents and
his wife's evidence as he has little recollection of past events.  It is my
view that the plaintiff's wife
was giving truthful evidence and she did not
seek to exaggerate the plaintiff's condition.  It is convenient at this stage
to comment
upon the manner in which the plaintiff gave his evidence.  When
giving evidence the plaintiff seemed to understand the difference
between
having an actual memory of events or having been told something later.  After
being asked some questions he immediately became
agitated and replied that he
could not remember.  However, in the next sentence of his answer he could
actually provide the answers.
 Sometimes when answering questions he would give
up and did not try to recall the information.  While giving evidence and being
cross examined he demonstrated a range of emotions.  At times he was visibly
upset, sometimes angry, sometimes he rambled on from
one topic to another.  
<P>

41	
<P>

A short summary of the plaintiff's work history prior to the accident is as
follows.  After completing his school certificate in
1975, the plaintiff worked
for Eric South Industries between March and August 1977.  Between 16 February
1978 and 20 March 1978 he
was employed by Famuma Pty Limited, a bathroom
fitting factory.  Between 26 January 1979 and 27 January 1987 the plaintiff was
employed
by the Government Supply Department.  After his first year of work as
a cleaner he became the cleaner in charge.  He was responsible
for the
organisation and supervision of 10 cleaning staff.  The references which were
tendered into evidence show that the plaintiff
was a courteous and obliging
employee and that he carried out the administrative tasks associated with this
position in an efficient
and reliable manner.  The plaintiff did extra duties
if required and he was able to vary his duties to meet unexpected
requirements.
<P>

42	The plaintiff gave evidence that he did not like primary school or high
school.  He is able to remember that he worked for Famuma
and he thinks that
they made shower screens for bathrooms.  He knows that he was employed as a
cleaner in charge at Shalvey High
School but at first he said that he could not
remember anything  however then he said that he has difficulty in remembering
but he
can remember ordering stores for the deputy principal.  
<P>

43	Prior to the accident the plaintiff used to breed part Arab horses and
marine and tropical fish.  He had dogs and cats at the
property at Whalan.  He
enjoyed boating, fishing and stamp collecting.  He had an interest in 
<P>

military history.  He was a handyman and installed an alarm in the house and he
also used to fixed stereo systems in people's cars.
 He had an interest in
music and a large record collection, his general health was good and he was
physically fit.
<P>

44	In 1987 the plaintiff obtained employment with the Westpac Banking
Corporation as a bank messenger.  References refer to him
as being a courteous,
competent and reliable worker who performed his duties in a most conscientious
manner.  The plaintiff left
that employment in April 1988 to commence
employment as a tradesman's assistant with the defendant.  In relation to the
plaintiff's
employment as a linesman he can remember going into a big building
but he has lost his memory and cannot recall anything about working
as a
linesman nor can he recall the accident.  
<P>

45	On 20 April 1989 the plaintiff completed his probation period. He was
employed on a full time basis by the defendant as a linesman.
 At the time of
the accident the plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for about 2
years.  For the year ended 30 June 1987
the plaintiff earned $20,287 and for
the year ended 30 June 1988 he earned $17,557.61.  
<P>

46	The plaintiff's wife gave evidence that she met the plaintiff in the early
1980's when she was married and the plaintiff was
in a relationship with Ms
Kathleen Teal.  Mrs Winifred Ann Foster (the plaintiff's wife) and her then
husband resided in Queensland.
 The plaintiff and Ms Teal resided in New South
Wales.  Mrs Foster met Ms Teal when they lived in the same block of units in
Gladesville
and became good friends.  Mrs Foster would visit the plaintiff and
Ms Teal on an annual basis.  The 
<P>

venue being either in Queensland or in New South Wales.  On these visits the
two couples would go to restaurants and on picnics.
 The plaintiff was very
pleasant and placid and did not get angry on these social occasions.
<P>

47	I turn to the plaintiff's medical condition and work history after the
accident.  He suffered a cardiac arrest requiring 20-30
minutes CPR.  On
admission he suffered from post electrocution cardiac arrhythmias, hypoxic
brain damage, mild rhabdomyolysis (dissolution
of cardiac musculature) with
some transient renal impairment and small areas of skin burns.  He remained in
intensive care for 6
days while his condition stabilised.  His normal heart
action was restored and no further treatment of the plaintiff's heart was
required.  The Westmead hospital discharge summary records that he suffered
significant hypoxic brain damage.  On 1 August 1980 when
he was discharged from
hospital he was able to walk around and talk to his family and follow complex 3
step commands.  He was transferred
to Parramatta hospital for rehabilitation.

<P>

48	The plaintiff now remembers being in Westmead hospital but does not remember
for how long.  He can remember going to a building
in Parramatta where he
thinks he had rehabilitation and where he was taught to talk and walk again.
At rehabilitation he had difficulty
with orientation as to time and
inappropriate behaviour.  It was noted that he had poor problem solving ability
and impaired memory.
 He had difficulty handling money and according to Dr
Sandanam the staff specialist of rehabilitation medicine at Westmead hospital
in January 1991, the plaintiff was unable to work for at least 6 months.
<P>

49	After the plaintiff's accident Ms Teal telephoned Mrs Foster and asked her
to come down to Sydney and help.  For a period of
about 6 to 8 weeks both Mrs
Foster and Ms Teal went to the hospital every day.  On the day of his discharge
Mrs Foster returned to
Queensland.  In September 1990 Ms Teal and the plaintiff
went to stay with the plaintiff's now wife and her then husband in Queensland
for 2 weeks.  The plaintiff slept most of the time and was confused.  In
December 1990, Mrs Foster's marriage with her then husband
broke up.  She
returned to Sydney and stayed with Ms Teal.  Mrs Foster at this time found the
plaintiff erratic, he never slept and
he was aggressive.  He would push her and
became frustrated with anger.  He would wash the walls with bleach every night
as he thought
they had germs.  He would wander around at night and would not go
back to bed when asked.  He would get into a blind rage and smash
things such
as the light fittings in the ceiling or rip the sliding door off its hinges and
hit the ironing board so that it collapsed.
 Mrs Foster said it was difficult
to put a finger on what triggered the rage.  The word "Prospect" made him lose
control.
<P>

50	Shortly after the accident the plaintiff was unable to remember anything.
He did not know his parents and he did not see much
of his parents at this
time.  He was unable to remember his childhood and did not remember moving
house to Whalan which had occurred
6 weeks prior to the accident.  After some
time Ms Teal moved out of the home saying that she could not "hack it any more"
and that
Mrs Foster was a stronger person who could take care of the
plaintiff.
<P>

51	
<P>

In January 1991 (six months after the accident) the plaintiff and Mrs Foster
moved in with the plaintiff's parents at Mount Druitt.
 Mrs Foster returned to
work at Quakers Hill nursing home on a full time basis.  During the day while
Mrs Foster was at work the
plaintiff's mother and father looked after the
plaintiff.  In March or April 1991 the plaintiff was unable to cope with living
with
his parents and so he and his wife moved to a house in Kingswood which was
next door to his sister Kay.  Kay although working full
time helped to look
after the plaintiff.  Mr and Mrs Foster remained living at this address until 5
December 1992.  Mrs Foster continued
to work full time between the hours of
6.00 am and 3.00 pm while the plaintiff was at rehabilitation.  After a few
weeks Mrs Foster's
daughter Sharon moved in to look after the plaintiff during
the day while Mrs Foster was at work.  During this time the plaintiff's
behaviour did not change much except that he was running away from home more.
Mrs Foster would ask the plaintiff how his day at rehabilitation
went and if he
did not want to talk about it he would run away.  At this time the plaintiff
would also take off if the queue was
too long in the supermarket or if he saw a
"Prospect" truck.  Mrs Foster would have to drive the streets searching for
him. 
<P>

52	While Mr and Mrs Foster resided at Kingswood he was able to go to the corner
store, drive or walk to Penrith.  The plaintiff
could drive short distances but
not usually on his own.  On one occasion while his wife was driving a motor
vehicle the plaintiff
grabbed the steering wheel.  On 16 June 1991, the
plaintiff was video taped mowing the lawn around the house.  He made a
concentrated
effort and completed the task. 
<P>

53	
<P>

During this time the plaintiff did not sleep very much and in bed he had quick
jerking movements and thrashed about although he
did not always wake up when
this occurred.  Mrs Foster attempted to sleep with the plaintiff but she could
not sleep in the same
room.  The plaintiff would come into her room continually
as he was frightened and wanted her to hold him.  
<P>

54	Between 1990 and 1991 the plaintiff received rehabilitation from Prospect
Council and he was re-issued with his driving licence.
 On 8 June 1991,
videotape tendered by the defendant showed the plaintiff driving a car down the
street.  On 16 September 1991 the
plaintiff returned to employment in the
stores at Seven Hills depot in an attempt to return to the workforce.  He
undertook light
duties 2 hours per day for the first 2 weeks and after one
month increased this to 3 hours per day for 2 days per week.  The plaintiff's
wife says that he felt under pressure doing these light duties and that in fact
he had no work other than sweeping the floors.
<P>

55	In November 1991 the hours he worked were increased to 9 hours per week.  In
November 1991 he was increased to 12 hours per week.
  On 13 November 1991 the
plaintiff advised the defendant that he could not continue to work on that
basis. The plaintiff has a recollection
of working at Seven Hills.  He gave
evidence that when he went back to work for Prospect at Seven Hills at the
store he put wires
together and sometimes no-one else was there so he swept the
floors.  He said that whilst at the depot at Seven Hills he felt disgraced
and
a complete moron and that he tries to blank it out.  In order to get to work at
Seven Hills the plaintiff's wife drove him to
Kingswood station where he was
able to catch a train.  
<P>

He was picked up at the other end by an employee of Prospect Council and driven
to the depot.  The plaintiff recollects that he
quite often got on the wrong
train and instead of going to Parramatta a few times he ended up at Redfern (t
p 81).  The plaintiff
has not worked since this attempt at light duties.
<P>

56	Mr Warner a fellow employee (referred to earlier in this judgment) had
worked with the plaintiff for 2 years prior to the accident.
 He saw the
plaintiff at the Seven Hills depot once or twice and spoke to him.  The
plaintiff did not seem to recognise him.  Mr
Warner observed that the plaintiff
was not doing any work but wandering around aimlessly and did not seem to know
what he was doing
there.
<P>

57	The plaintiff remembers that he used to become violent which he now regrets.
He recalled the incident, and to use his words,
when he "smashed the crap out
of the lights".  While the plaintiff was working at Seven Hills he grabbed the
sliding door and pushed
it into the lights.  He said that he was very angry
after coming home from the Seven Hills depot but he is not like that now.  He
says that he feels like a criminal and at first he could not understand what
had happened and it was as if he had done something
wrong.  He now understands
what has happened but he sometimes does not understand how he feels and it is
like a nightmare.
<P>

58	It was between April 1992 and September 1992 that the plaintiff undertook
behavioural treatment with the defendant.  On 19 October
1992, Dr Sandanam
reported that he had seen the plaintiff 5 times over 
<P>

the previous 15 months and that the plaintiff's memory and concentration had
remained poor.  His cognitive deficits were of a permanent
nature and it was
unlikely that he would ever be fit to return to his previous employment.  
<P>

59	On 22 October 1992 videotape evidence showed the plaintiff walking along the
side of a park and crossing a four lane road.  He
made a purchase at a shop and
returned home via the park carrying a plastic bag.  On 31 October 1992 video
tape showed the plaintiff
driving a car down the road.  The plaintiff drove to
a petrol station, filled a can with petrol from a petrol pump and put the can
back in the car.  He reversed the car made a right hand turn onto a busy road,
stopped at two sets of traffic lights and parked the
car.  He asked a male for
directions and then was shown carrying 4 cardboard boxes back to the car.  He
put the boxes into the car
and drove home.
<P>

60	On 5 December 1992 the plaintiff and Mrs Foster married.  Mrs Foster did not
want to get married but the plaintiff said that
he felt safer and thought that
if they were married she would not ditch him.  On 6 December 1992 the plaintiff
and his wife moved
to Queensland as the plaintiff's wife had bought a
delicatessen business in Surfers Paradise.  She employed her brother, another
employee and Mr Sorrensen (who owned the business prior to her buying it).  Mrs
Foster chose to do this because she had become asthmatic
and because of Alan's
not wanting to be in the western suburbs and his running away (t 18).  Both the
plaintiff and Mrs Foster understood
when they left Sydney that the defendant
had given up trying to get the plaintiff back into the workforce.  The
plaintiff would go
to work with her at the shop.  He was able to put newspapers
on the shelf and do the banking at Westpac 2 or 3 times per week provided
that
his wife did the paperwork.  He could pack the shelves, bring in the newspapers
and go to Woolworths to buy items for the shop
if required.  He could mop and
sweep the floor.  Sometimes Mrs Foster left him alone in the shop when she
needed to go to the toilet.
 Mrs Foster did not think he was capable of giving
change nor could he make sandwiches.  He liked being there and chatting with
the
regular customers.  On 15 June 1993 the plaintiff was shown on video tape
wandering in the shop.  His wife was also present.  
<P>

61	The plaintiff drove when they first moved to Queensland but has not driven
for some time.  He does not like driving without someone
with him because he
does not feel confident on the road and he may have a spasm.
<P>

62	On 24 March 1993, the plaintiff was offered employment as a car park
attendant at the defendant's head office in Parramatta (Ex
H).  The
commencement date was 17 April 1993.  His duties were outlined as overseeing
the car park, directing visitors to head office
to vacant car spaces as
available and to ensure that car parking by staff was as designated.  The hours
were negotiable.  The plaintiff's
wife replied that she did not know how he was
capable of supervising a car park when he could not supervise his daily life
and his
injuries prevented him from living out a normal life and holding a job.
She stated that his medication alone made him constantly
tired and it was not
that the plaintiff did not want to work.  The plaintiff's employment was
subsequently terminated.
<P>

63	In September 1993 Mrs Foster had a breakdown.  The reasons she gave for this
was that although the business was good she had
to work fewer hours because she
was not getting any sleep.  This was due in part to the plaintiff not sleeping.
She sold the business.
 She then worked from 5.00 am to 9 or 10.00 am in an
onion factory.  While she was away from home, the plaintiff stayed in bed.
Subsequently
she obtained employment as a casual assistant in nursing at Small
Haven Benowa where she still works on a permanent casual basis
for 20 hours per
fortnight.  
<P>

64	In late 1993 the plaintiff visited Dr David Luis once a month for 6 months.
Dr Luis reported that the plaintiff suffered from
severe chronic brain injury
deficit namely intellectual impairment, attention and concentration deficits,
problems in acquiring new
memory, frontal lobe damage:  perseveration, planning
disabilities, poor judgment and disinhibition all of which are permanent.
Accordingly
to Dr Luis no treatment known to medical science can alter the
reality that he will suffer from severe brain damage for the rest
of his life.
It was the opinion of Dr Luis that the plaintiff could not return to any type
of employment with his employer.
<P>

65	The plaintiff's wife said that in late 1993 the plaintiff's restless leg
syndrome improved.  However there was no improvement
of his mental and
behavioural state.  On 15 April 1994 the plaintiff was shown on videotape
wandering along a street of shops by
himself.  He was pausing to look into shop
windows.  At midday he had coffee in a caf&eacute; with a female.  He had a
conversation
for about 20 minutes.  He paid the bill but it was not possible to
ascertain whether he had been given the right money with which
to pay the bill
or if he was able to work this out.  He walked with the female to a train
station car park and got into the passenger
side of the car. 
<P>

66

Videotapes taken on 21 and 22 October 1997 show the plaintiff getting out of a
car with an older man.  They crossed the road at
the lights, walked along the
footpath and browsed in shop windows.  They entered a CD shop and the plaintiff
pointed to particulars
CDs.  The next day the plaintiff is shown getting out of
the passenger side of a motor vehicle and holding dogs on leads.  An older
man
and woman got out and took the dogs.  They all walked along a track adjacent to
a beach.  The plaintiff carried a plastic bag
and held a small dog when they
got back to the car.  Later the plaintiff was observed with the older woman in
a supermarket.  The
plaintiff carried the shopping basket and picked up items
from the shelves.  He did not take an active role but appeared to merely
follow
instructions.  He was patient.  They met up with the older man and the
plaintiff put the shopping in the boot of the car.
<b> </b>
<P>

67	The plaintiff still has a tendency to flee from situations he feels he
cannot cope with.  I have referred to incidents where
this occurred earlier in
this judgment.  Mrs Foster gave evidence that in August 1998 after they had a
conference with counsel in
relation to this case, the plaintiff once outside
Wentworth Chambers took off.  The plaintiff's wife went back to the hotel near
Central.  He was not there.  She walked back to counsel's chambers.  He turned
up later and told her that he had opened his wallet
and shown a passerby the
card of the hotel and they directed him to it.  The plaintiff's wife says that
she accepts the plaintiff's
running away as part of his behaviour.  If he is
unable to deal with something he runs away but he has never stayed away for
days.
 The plaintiff has made one suicide attempt by taking an overdose of
tablets and talks of suicide.  His wife believes that he would
not take his
life as his religious beliefs tell him that it is wrong.
<P>

68	The defendant alleged that the plaintiff is capable of driving a motor
vehicle.  In relation to driving, the plaintiff's wife
agreed that he was
driving a car in the early stages (t 58).  She took the car to work.  The
plaintiff could walk from Kingswood
to Penrith and if she did not have the car
he could drive there.  She agreed that the plaintiff had driven in Queensland
probably
on about half a dozen occasions.  He drove while they were at
Broadbeach and a couple of occasions when they lived at their current
address
at Biggara Waters (t 61).  While she has not placed any restrictions on him
driving, she prefers him not to drive.  Dr Craft's
opinion is that the
plaintiff should not drive (this is referred to later in the judgment).  Mrs
Langekluddecke a clinical psychologist
was shown film of the plaintiff driving.
She said that while she did not know that he drove, it did not surprise her
that he could
as borderline people can drive a motor vehicle.
<P>

69	It is my view that the plaintiff has been capable of driving short distances
along familiar roads.  The videotapes show this
and it is consistent with the
plaintiff's wife and the plaintiff's evidence.  It appears that in recent times
the plaintiff has become
socially withdrawn and lost confidence with driving
alone or even with his wife accompanying him.
<P>

70	The plaintiff's wife currently has a permanent shift in the nursing home
where she does 20 hours per fortnight and works from
5.00 am to 9.00 am.  She
does 8 hours the first week and 12 hours the second week.  She either drops the
plaintiff off at her daughter's
place or otherwise he stays at home and watches
videos or sleeps.  She also started a scouting group at Madgeera.  She has
taken
the plaintiff along to some of these activities such as camping and
picnics on a few occasions.  He just watches and does not become
involved.
<P>

71	In relation to the plaintiff's current situation, physically he is much the
same although weight continues to be a problem. 
He has a scar on his upper
right arm and small scars on his fingers.  He says that now he has a lot of
nerve problems and he is unable
to sleep;  he has continual headaches with pain
behind his eyes.  He experiences shooting pain from his head down to the centre
of
his foot all of the time and he has had to accept his pain, and the shooting
pain from his head to his foot as nothing can be done
about it.  He is unable
to sleep at night and is tired all day.  During the night he has spasms and
goes flying out of bed.  He is
exhausted and goes cold and collapses.  He says
that he wants to "croak it" as the pain is too much.  He has marks on his right
hand
and right shoulder and scars from the electrocution.  He says that he
suffers from depression and likes to hide himself away because
he fears tasks,
he cannot do things very well, forgets things and has to be helped.  He goes
into his room and puts a record on when
he has had enough as it is his way of
coping.  He sees no future at all.  He feels that his life has finished and the
only place
that he feels comfortable is at Head Way, as there are others with
problems.  
<P>

72	The plaintiff has had difficulty in performing bladder and bowel functions.
It appears that this can be managed by the awareness
on the part of his carer
to provide suitable prompting to the plaintiff to regularly empty his bladder.
There is no evidence that
the plaintiff is currently using catheters.
<P>

73	He says that he loves his wife very much but feels like he bludges on her
and uses her.  Again he referred to being a second
rate person and that he puts
too much burden on his wife.  He says that without her he feels that he would
be in a mental institution.
 The plaintiff stated the only time that he said he
felt happy was when he had conversations with the minister at Kingswood.  He
said that the minister was very nice and told him to accept things for what
they are.  Unfortunately the minister moved on to another
parish.  
<P>

74	The plaintiff's wife says that in the last year or so the plaintiff's mental
state has deteriorated.  The plaintiff spends a
lot of time at home and lately
has become withdrawn, more agitated and more aggressive.  He no longer cares
what he says to people
and can speak in an abusive manner and use foul
language.  When engaged in a conversation he monopolises it and a lot of what
he
says does not make sense and he can become dogmatic.  However there has been
no physical change.  The current situation is that the
plaintiff can wash
himself, eat by himself, can go for walks, mow the lawn and assist with
domestic chores such as vacuuming and
mopping and the like.  He can go to the
local shop for one or two food items or more if he is provided with a note.  He
can carry
the shopping but he does not do the washing.  He can go to the
chemist and  collect his medication in a "Webster" pack.  He does
not take
alcohol or illicit drugs.  The Webster pack became necessary because the
plaintiff when depressed used to search for the
medication and take extra.  The
plaintiff's wife has to watch him take the medication and then hide the
pack.
<P>

75	Dr Delaney an ophthalmic surgeon says that the plaintiff has a marked
convergence weakness in his eyes which is attributable
to the electrocution.
Aside from exercises no other treatment was required and there was no
assessable loss of vision.  As previously
stated there are no continuing
problems with the plaintiff's heart.
<P>

76	I turn to the issue of the plaintiff's brain damage.  There is no dispute
that the plaintiff is suffering some level of permanent
brain damage caused by
the accident.  There is a dispute as to whether the plaintiff has been
exaggerating the level of his brain
damage so I have referred to evidence on
this topic in detail.  I have already referred to the evidence of Dr Sandanam
and Dr Luis
 There was a dispute between Doctors Langeluddecke and Roberts as
to the use of the Rey 15 Item test.  Dr Langeluddecke says that
it has been
criticised in recent literature and this test should not be used.  Dr Roberts
said that this was one of a number of tests
she relied upon to reach her
conclusions.  
<P>

77	In October 1990 Dr Lorentz stated that the plaintiff suffered from
significant hypoxic brain damage, causing profound deficits
of recent and
remote memory and general cognitive functioning.  At that stage there could
have been some improvement but it was certain
that the plaintiff would be left
with significant permanent cognitive deficits and it was too early to tell
whether he would be able
to return to employment.  In 1992 Dr Sandanam stated
that the plaintiff's memory and concentration remained poor.  He noted that
the
plaintiff had no physical disability although he noted that the plaintiff had
insomnia and a disturbed sleep pattern due to chronic
leg pain.  Dr Sandanam
thought that it was unlikely that the plaintiff would ever be fit to return to
his previous employment.  Dr
John Polgar stated that the plaintiff suffered
cardiac arrest following his electrocution which resulted in hypoxic brain
damage.
 Dr Metcalfe agrees with Dr Polgar and says that the plaintiff had not
improved and both agree that the plaintiff is unemployable.
 
<P>

78	
<P>

On 23 June 1993, the plaintiff's general practitioner Dr Hart agreed that the
plaintiff suffered from severe hypoxic brain damage
from the time of his
electrocution.  He stated that the plaintiff would not be able to return to any
form of employment because he
had an inability to concentrate for long periods,
poor retention of complex commands, aggressive border line psychotic behaviour
and he was in need of constant supervision.  Jennifer Batchelor clinical
psychologist in her report said that the plaintiff was severely
disabled, had
limited insight and his memory and adaptive abilities had been severely
comprised.  
<P>

79	Dr Langeluddecke a clinical psychologist in September 1991 conducted some
psychometric testing.  Her opinion was that the plaintiff
suffered significant
impairment in attentional, intellectual, memory, learning, and executive
functions consistent with a severe
acquired organic brain syndrome due to
anoxia.  She says that in terms of the plaintiff's intellectual capacity, his
functioning
has been reduced from at least an average level pre-morbidly, to no
higher than a low borderline level and both his verbal and visuospatial
intellectual abilities have been severely affected.  Dr Langeluddecke is also
of the opinion that the plaintiff's reading, spelling
and verbal reasoning and
abstraction skills are severely diminished.  She says that the plaintiff has
very little capacity to plan,
analyse or synthesise visuospatial information
and his immediate attention span and capacity for sustained attention are
exceptionally
limited, which in turn compromises his ability to utilise his
limited residual intellectual skills.  She says that the plaintiff's
short-term
memory and new learning capacities are severely impaired in all modalities and
that his insight, behavioural control,
monitoring and cognitive flexibility are
severely diminished.  
<P>

80	Dr Langeluddecke's says that the plaintiff's severe cognitive deficits are
totally consistent in nature and severity with hypoxic
brain damage which
cannot be explained in terms of his anxiety and depressive symptoms, which
probably reflect not only organic brain
damage but also a reaction to his
diminished cognitive functioning and marked lifestyle change.  His problems
with insight, impulse
control and heightened aggression are in her view also
consistent with hypoxic brain damage.
<P>

81	In terms of the plaintiff's past and future earning capacity it is Dr
Langeluddecke's view that the plaintiff's motivational,
cognitive and
personality problems render him totally unemployable in any capacity.  In terms
of domestic assistance she is of the
opinion that the plaintiff will require
considerable assistance with daily living including prompting to attend to his
hygiene and
assistance with domestic duties, travel and management of his
financial affairs.  She comments that his quality of life is greatly
diminished
as he has lost his independence and his ability to undertake paid employment.
I have referred to her view of the plaintiff
being able to drive a motor
vehicle elsewhere in this judgment.
<P>

82	When Dr Langeluddecke gave the plaintiff further psychometric testing 8
years after the accident, she commented that the deficits
demonstrated on the
latter testing were well in excess of those reported at previous testing.  Her
explanation is that the plaintiff
is at risk of an acquired organic brain
syndrome and associated cognitive impairment and personality change.  In view
of the history
of brain trauma she identified two possible explanations for the
deterioration.  The first is that there has been a deterioration
in the
plaintiff's psychiatric state.  The other explanation is that the plaintiff is
exaggerating or feigning cognitive and behavioural
problems consistent with
having sustained a very severe brain injury.  She says that it is noteworthy
that available information
regarding the plaintiff's current lifestyle suggests
that his cognitive and emotional functioning in his normal environment is
exceptionally
poor.  He no longer drives a motor vehicle, lacks initiative and
appears highly dependent on his wife.  He also attends an organisation
for
persons with brain related disabilities three to four days per week.  In short
she says that there is a consistency between the
severe cognitive deficits
noted on formal testing and the plaintiff's functioning in his normal
environment.
<P>

83	After Dr Langeluddecke was supplied with an up to date report from the
treating psychiatrist Dr Craft, she said that his report
supported the view
that the deterioration in the plaintiff's cognitive functioning noted in the
recent psychometric testing is attributable
to a deterioration in the
plaintiff's emotional state.
<P>

84	Dr Craft has provided 3 reports dated 15 April 1994, 20 March 1998 and 18
September 1998.  He was cross examined at length. 
Since early 1994 to date, Dr
Craft has seen the plaintiff on a weekly basis, usually with the plaintiff's
wife.  The plaintiff's
wife provides details of the plaintiff's behaviour and
problems as the plaintiff cannot do this.  The doctor also treats the
plaintiff's
wife at these consultations.  The plaintiff's medication is varied
from week to week depending on circumstances.  Part of the plaintiff's
wife's
problems arise from having to deal with the plaintiff's behaviour.  These
consultations are one hour in duration and currently
cost $150 and he intends
to charge the plaintiff this fee regardless of whether Mrs Foster is there or
not (t 166).
<P>

85	
<P>

In 1993 Dr Craft formed the view that the plaintiff's competence and behaviour
deteriorated alarmingly under treatment.  In his
report dated 15 April 1994 Dr
Craft stated that the plaintiff's wife was fearful of leaving the plaintiff on
his own at home and
that the plaintiff had become agitated and suicidal.  The
plaintiff was suicidal and elated by turn, argumentative, violent and
irresponsible
and had reversed sleep patterns so that he roamed the room and
streets by night.  He recorded that the plaintiff was admitted to
the Gold
Coast hospital in October 1993.  Prior to this admission to hospital the
plaintiff had had an exacerbation of his epileptic
fits but after his
medication was rearranged these fits diminished.  
<P>

86	In about October 1993 Dr Craft noted that the plaintiff was more cheerful
and was not threatening imminent suicide.  It is Dr
Craft's opinion that the
plaintiff received a multiplicity of injuries from the electrocution at work
and has suffered severe residual
brain and peripheral nerve damage which has
reduced his mental functioning from that of a Westpac clerk employee and
qualified linesman
to that of an emotional, potentially violent childlike
person.  In some aspects he behaves like a turbulent child and in other aspects
he behaves like an erudite 12 year old (t 115).
<P>

87	Dr Craft commented that the plaintiff has a great deal of insight into his
condition and described the plaintiff as an emotional
chameleon.  The
plaintiff's mood is unpredictable from hour to hour, day to day.  These moods
are destructive to the plaintiff's
self esteem, his friends and relatives.  His
level of psychological functioning varies greatly from day to day.  In his last
report
Dr Craft refers to the plaintiff's weight gain, his psychotic episodes
which in part may be attributable to the medication 
<P>

and his extreme mood liability in that he is capable of moving from suicide to
elation in the course of one day.  It should be noted
that the plaintiff has
recently lost weight although his weight does vary over time and can become
problematic.
<P>

88	Dr Craft in his report dated 20 March 1998 says that the plaintiff
psychiatrically presents himself at his surgery with a wide
range of moods,
which are entirely unpredictable.  He says that at times the plaintiff is half
asleep, at other times he is confused
and there are times when he is ebullient,
overcheerful, full of quips and jokes and says he is full of energy and at
other times
is depressed, retarded, somnolent and threatens suicide.  Also in
energy the plaintiff ranges from manic outbursts to suicidal inanition
and
fortunately at these times he is too inert to be a danger to himself.  However,
the plaintiff has erratic temper tantrums.  Small
things upset him greatly.

<P>

89	Dr Craft has observed the plaintiff's tantrums.  Firstly, the plaintiff
throws his arms around a great deal, bangs and throws
things and this frightens
people.  Then the plaintiff due to his avoidant personality moves forward at
some speeds, like an enraged
bull elephant throwing everybody on either side
with no interest as to those persons' welfare (t 116).  On one recent occasion
in
August 1998, the plaintiff ranted and raved, waved his arms and threatened
Dr Craft.  Then the plaintiff bolted out Dr Craft's door
and attempted to get
out of the waiting room.  The plaintiff subsequently wrote a letter of apology
to Dr Craft which was tendered
in evidence.  He says that the plaintiff's
anxiety levels vary from panic to ease, in outlook from homicidal paranoia to
moderate
suspicion.  
<P>

90	In May 1998 the plaintiff was referred to the Gold Coast Sleep Disorder
Centre.  During a sleep test conducted at the hospital
the plaintiff's restless
leg syndrome precipitated him off the couch twice during the night.  The
plaintiff says this happens whilst
he is sleeping at home.  According to the
recent sleep assessment his adequate sleep is less than 46% per night.  The
plaintiff continues
to suffer extreme pain in his leg and these psychomotor
episodes of shooting pain are now so severe that they disrupt the sleep of
both
the plaintiff and his wife.  The result is that the plaintiff is chronically
fatigued, irritated and occasionally aggressive,
deteriorating over the years
that he has been examining the plaintiff to times when he is concerned both at
the potentiality of aggression
to others and to himself.  Dr Craft referred to
the plaintiff being at high risk at night because of the likelihood of the
plaintiff
precipitating himself out of bed, waking up, shouting, committing
noise, wandering around the house and falling down the stairs in
a confused
state (t 149).  Dr Craft did not think that the plaintiff should drive a car
due to his epilepsy and his psychiatric state.
<P>

91	The two main current concerns Dr Craft referred to in evidence were the
plaintiff's epilepsy or epileptiform episodes and his
sleep jactitations.  Dr
Craft was also concerned with respiratory tract infections which in part are
attributable to the high doses
of medication he is required to take.
Previously the plaintiff had grand mal seizures.  The last recorded grand mal
seizure was in
September 1997 and it appears that the number of seizures are
decreasing although the plaintiff's epileptiform episodes have increased
in the
last year or two.  The greater the medication used to control his epilepsy
means he is sedated  and he does less to clear
his respiratory system so he
suffers coughs and colds (t 122).
<P>

92	It is Dr Craft's opinion that intellectually the plaintiff continues to
deteriorate and is now functioning at a low intellectual
level comparable to a
child and necessitating continuous care.  However he has never imposed
restrictions concerning the plaintiff
being left home unsupervised, going out
into the community and to the shopping centre, crossing roads and returning
home.  However,
the plaintiff may constitute a danger to the public if he has
an epileptic fit or "runs amok" like the incident which occurred in
Dr Craft's
surgery.  
<P>

93	In relation to the plaintiff's earning capacity, although Dr Craft would
encourage him to get back to working, he does not think
that the plaintiff
would be able to maintain interest or be reliable in cleaning work.  When asked
if the plaintiff could now work
3 hours per week he replied that he could work
if as in Sir Thomas More's "Utopia" there was a job in existence where he could
do
as little or as much as he wanted.  He does not think the plaintiff would be
able to do the work he did in 1991.  However, if the
plaintiff was supervised
and looked after each hour of the day he could do something (t 164).  
<P>

94	In relation to care, Dr Craft says that without the care of the plaintiff's
devoted wife he would require at least a hostel or
possibly a nursing home.  In
evidence Dr Craft stated that care would involve a regime of 24 hour care.  Dr
Craft estimated the plaintiff's
life expectancy to be at least 20-30 years and
in evidence he reduced this to 20-25 years (t 125).  Dr Craft estimates that
the plaintiff's
wife will be able to care for him for a further 10 years (t
127.5).  
<P>

95	
<P>

Dr Yeo in his report dated 20 April 1993, says that the plaintiff suffered
severe diffused brain damage following hypoxia which
resulted from the
electrocution.  He says that the plaintiff has a severe permanent disability
and is unable to resume suitable part
time or full time employment.  He says
that he doubts that a paid live-in housekeeper would be able to provide the
supervision and
personal care which Mrs Foster provides.  After a period of 15
years (from 1993) he says that institutional care would be necessary
and he
says that even during the 15 year period the plaintiff will require a handyman
for 4 hours per week and a companion attendant
for 8 hours per week.  He says
that the life expectancy of the plaintiff could be shortened due to his labile
emotional state and
the susceptibility to anxiety and depression.  He says that
the plaintiff should live in his own home and maintain a familiar
environment.
<P>

96	Mark Weatherley, psychologist, in his report dated 27 April 1993, concluded
that the plaintiff's intellectual capacity was reduced
from above average to
low borderline and due to this brain damage he is incapable of holding any job
in open employment market. 

<P>

97	Dr Middleton commented that her findings were consistent with Dr
Langeluddecke's finding of August 1994 and with the plaintiff's
current
presentation.  Dr Middleton considered that the plaintiff's acquired organic
brain impairment was consistent with the effects
of electrocution and
associated with cardiac arrest.  She says that the plaintiff continues to
present with a combination of emotional,
psychiatric, memory and cognitive
impairments and is unable to return to any paid employment on the open labour
market.  
<P>

98	Dr Middleton says that the plaintiff will permanently need to have a
structured living situation with the organisation of all
his domestic and every
day living activities and the provision of a considerable amount of support and
assistance in the performance
and delivery of such activities.  The daily
activities that require supervision include monitoring, prompting and
encouraging suitable
daily living routines and participating in some form of
regular vocational program out of his home base.  She thought that the
vocational
program, that is organised through Headway was suitable.  
<P>

99	In 1994 Dr Wayne Reid a clinical neuro psychologist reported that there was
no significant improvement in the plaintiff's intellectual
and cognitive
functioning since he was first assessed in 1991 and that in some areas of
functioning the plaintiff's abilities have
declined.  Dr Reid was of the view
that motivational factors were affecting his performance and he considered that
his prognosis
for returning to the open job market was poor and that the
plaintiff would have difficulties in living a fully independent lifestyle
without some support for the rest of his life.
<P>

100	Dr Wendy Roberts and Associate Professor Jones disagree with the views
expressed above.  Dr Roberts' report dated 1 June 1997
says that while some
level of dysfunction was not unexpected given the severity of the injuries
which the plaintiff sustained, the
results of the psychometric test scores that
she administered were not reliable and that independent information on his
functioning
needs to be used to try and determine the actual level of
impairment.  She says that it is highly likely the plaintiff has a history
of
personality problems pre-dating his accident and there were significant gaps in
his work history.  In terms of the plaintiff's
past and future earning capacity
she remains to be convinced that the plaintiff cannot engage in remunerative
employment nor is she
convinced that the plaintiff required general supervision
for day to day activities.  She does not believe that he has nightmares
or
flashbacks about the accident.  Nor is she convinced that the plaintiff lacks
confidence of insight and behaviour control.  
<P>

101	Associate Professor Richard Jones examined the plaintiff on 16 April 1997.
He wrote reports relating to that examination and
in a report dated 31 March
1998 it was his view that the plaintiff was feigning brain impairment.  He said
that the apparent neurological
impairment was not in any known distribution
which might suggest peripheral neuropathy spinal cord or brain damage.  There
was also
apparent neurological impairment and the plaintiff's apparent loss of
memory is not organically based.  He believes that the plaintiff
has the
potential to be independent in all activities of daily living.  He believes
that if the plaintiff was motivated he could
return to work.  However he gives
a rider that it is inadvisable for the plaintiff for psychological reasons to
work with electricity.
 Associate Professor Jones is of the view that the
plaintiff does not require a full time carer or any person to be at call 24
hours
a day 7 days per week because he is independent in personal care and had
the potential to be independent in all activities of every
day living.
Further, it is his view that were the plaintiff to believe in himself that
there had been recovery from his perceived
impairment he could return to
work.
<P>

102	It is not disputed that the plaintiff suffered some level of neurological
impairment as a result of the electrocution.  All
the doctors (except Dr
Roberts and Associate Professor Jones) are of the view that the plaintiff is
not capable of returning to work
with the defendant, although Associate
Professor Jones stated that working with electricity was contraindicated.
Associate Professor
Jones and Dr Roberts say that the plaintiff can return to
work.  They do not say what sort of work and whether it could be full time
of
part time.  When Dr Craft was asked about whether he thought that the plaintiff
was malingering, he answered that the plaintiff
would sometimes accentuate his
symptoms in the hope of profit or gain, but that would vary very much from day
to day and hour to
hour (t 165).  His behaviour in this regard is rather like
that of a little boy.  
<P>

103	I accept that the plaintiff may have been accentuating his disabilities
when he saw Dr Roberts and Associate Professor Jones
and even when giving
evidence in court but this is due to his psychiatric condition.  This behaviour
could account for the discrepancies
reported by Dr Robert and Associate
Professor Jones.  In relation to the plaintiff's level of brain impairment, the
plaintiff's past
and future earning capacity, level of care and medication
required, I prefer the evidence of Dr Craft as he has seen the plaintiff
on a
weekly basis for the last four years and has formed his view after numerous
consultations.  His evidence was tested by lengthy
cross examination and I
found his evidence to be truthful.  His evidence largely accords with that of
Doctors Hart, Langeluddecke,
Middleton and Yeo.
<P>

<b><u>Non-economic loss</u></b>
<P>

104	I have taken into account that prior to the accident the plaintiff had a
job he enjoyed.  He was in good health.  He had hobbies
such as breeding Arab
horses, marine and tropical fish, boating, fishing, stamp collecting, music and
military history.  He had some
ability as handyman.  He was independent and
enjoyed going to restaurants, picnics and the like.  After the accident, he
spent one
month in hospital and the years of 1991, 1992 and 1993 undergoing
rehabilitation.  Without repeating them, his current disabilities
and lifestyle
are set out in Dr Craft's reports referred to earlier in this judgment and I
take them into account.  I also take into
account the pain that the plaintiff
suffered.  He continues to suffer shooting pain from his head down his leg, he
cannot sleep properly
and has to take large doses of medication.  I also take
into account that he has insight into his condition and feels useless.  He
has
scars on his right hand and shoulder from the electrocution.  I assess
non-economic loss at 75% of a most extreme case. ie.,
75% x $190,495.63 =
$142,871.72.  There is no interest payable on this component of damages - see s
151M(3)
<P>

<b><u>Past and future earning capacity</u></b>
<P>

105	Prior to the accident the plaintiff had been in continual employment for
many years and it is my view that if the accident had
not occurred he would
have continued with his employment with the defendant as an electrical linesman
until retirement age.  He had
several jobs after he left school before he found
a job he enjoyed.  The plaintiff claims past economic loss on the basis that he
would have continued in employment with the defendant as a linesman.  From the
evidence I am satisfied that the plaintiff would have
continued with this
employment or a similar job until retirement.  
<P>

106	The cross defendant submitted that nowadays there is no guarantee that the
plaintiff would have remained in employment until
65 years of age and he may
have been forced to retire at 55 years.  There was no specific evidence given
on the plaintiff's intended
retirement age.  While on one hand he would have
worked until 65 years under, the anti-discrimination legislation it is also
possible
that the plaintiff may have worked either full time or part time after
the age of 65 years.  It is my view that a possible early
retirement is
adequately reflected in the deduction made for vicissitudes. 
<P>

107	The defendant submitted that the plaintiff is capable of some part time
light duties such as that which he undertook in 1991
with the defendant or as a
car park attendant which was work offered to him.  Many of the doctors are of
the view that the plaintiff
is unemployable.  With the plaintiff's fluctuation
of moods from hour to hour, his difficulties with memory, attentional,
intellectual,
learning and executive functions it would be most unlikely that
the plaintiff would be able to hold down a job in any field.  Dr
Craft stated
that the plaintiff would be able to hold a job if he could do as little or as
much as he wanted but that the plaintiff
would not be able to do the work he
did in 1991 (t 164).  
<P>

108	The plaintiff and his wife gave evidence that the plaintiff did not do much
at the Seven Hills depot but sweep the floor and
put wires together.  Mr Warner
also observed that the plaintiff did not appear to be doing any work but
wandering aimlessly.  The
plaintiff caught the wrong transport to work and
became angry and aggressive while undertaking this employment.  The defendant
did
not provide any evidence such as his supervisor to demonstrate that the
plaintiff was capable of continuing this employment.  It
is my view that the
plaintiff would not have been capable of continuing in this employment and it
was realistic that he notified
his employer that he could not continue with
these light duties when he did so.
<P>

109	In relation to the offer of the car park attendant's job, I accept that the
plaintiff can drive by himself over short distances
on familiar roads.  He
would be capable of parking cars in car spaces.  His wife agrees that while the
plaintiff could drive he has
not done so for years.  She does not think the
plaintiff is capable of shuffling cars around a car park or moving a car from
one
car space to another (t 41).  Dr Craft thinks that he should not hold a
licence due to his temper tantrums and epilepsy as he could
pose a danger to
others.  It is my view that the plaintiff's moods fluctuate from hour to hour,
his behaviour includes rages and
fleeing and he has epileptiform attacks.  He
has the potential to have a grand mal seizure while working.  The plaintiff is
not capable
of overseeing a car park, directing cars to vacant car spaces and
ensuring that staff were parking in their designated car spots.
 It is my view
that the plaintiff has been virtually unemployable since the accident.  No
doctor has suggested that his condition
will significantly improve, other than
his epilepsy and right leg problems.  Nevertheless, Dr Craft stated that with a
system that
could supervise and look after him each hour of the day, he could
do something even though he was not able to undertake simple tasks
such as
cleaning and putting things on shelves (t 164.5).  
<P>

110	In relation to mitigation of damages (s 151L) it is my view that the
plaintiff has undergone appropriate medical treatment,
has co-operated in
procedures under the employer's workplace rehabilitation program and other
rehabilitation programs.  Later he
tried to assist his wife with basic tasks in
the shop while he was being supervised.  
<P>

111	In relation to the appropriate deduction for vicissitudes of life, I take
into account that the plaintiff is on high doses of
medication which adversely
affect the ability of his body to deal with respiratory infections and his
possible suicide attempts,
but it is my view that as I have already found that
he has a diminished life expectancy, it is not appropriate to deduct a sum
higher
than the usual 15% for vicissitudes - 15% is an appropriate deduction.
I should add that the plaintiff has not claimed an amount
of damages for
diminished life expectancy.  
<P>

112	I accept Dr Craft's estimate of the plaintiff's life expectancy as being
between 20-25 years.  His original view had been 25-30
years.  I accept that
the plaintiff will live a further estimated 24 years ie., until he is 63
years.
<P>

113	It is possible but unlikely that the plaintiff may at some time in the
future obtain some remunerative employment.  It would
be only for a few hours a
week at best and he would need to be constantly supervised.  For example if the
plaintiff mowed a lawn
and another employee did the gardening and supervised
him.  In accordance with <b><u>Malec v J C Hutton Pty Limited</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20638" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990)
169 CLR 638</a> an award for damages should reflect this possibility.  Doing the
best I can I make an allowance of $25 per week.  The plaintiff would
have
earned $559 per week and making an allowance that the plaintiff could earn $25
per week gives the sum of $534 for 26 years on
5% tables (multiplier 768.7)
less 15% for vicissitudes = $348,912.93.
<P>

114	As it is expected that the plaintiff will not live beyond 63 years, there
must be a deduction made against this figure for the
probable living expenses
or maintenance necessary to enable the earning of future wages for 2 years
(until he reaches his expected
retirement age of 65 years) plus tax.  It is my
view that the plaintiff's wife would have continued to work either part time or
full
time had the accident not occurred and she would have been responsible
jointly for the costs of running the household.  I have been
referred to a copy
of <b>1993-4 Bureau of Statistics Household Expenditure Survey</b> (Ex 9).
After looking at the items for couples only under the heading "Broad
Expenditure Group", a reasonable sum per week to reflect
probable living
expenses and tax is $240 per week for 2 years equates to $24,960 and thus the
amount for future economic loss is
$323,952.93.
<P>

115	The plaintiff's past loss of earning capacity based on a comparable
employee's wage records amounts to $248,753.46 from the
date of the accident to
trial.  The defendant agrees with the calculation of this amount.  However, I
accept that since 31 January
1993 the plaintiff may have been able to do some
limited supervised work as referred to earlier.  An amount equalling $25 per
week
should be deducted from this sum.  This deduction comes to $7,625 being
$25 per week for 305 weeks until the date of trial.  $248,753.46
less $7,625
equals $241,128.46.  The plaintiff has received $46,465.10 in weekly
compensation payments and $27,452.38 has been paid
for the plaintiff's hospital
and medical expenses.  This sum totals $73,917.48 and should be deducted from
past economic loss, ie.,
 $241,128.46 plus past economic loss from 7 December
1998 to 12 March 1999 equals 14 weeks at $534 per week equals $7,476.
Therefore,
past economic loss equals $241,128.46 + $7,476 = $248,604.46 -
$73,917.48 = $174,686.98.
<P>

<b><u>Loss of superannuation</u></b>
<P>

116	At the date of the accident the plaintiff was a non-contributing member of
the State Authorities Superannuation Scheme which
entitled him on retirement at
65 years to a basic benefit.  
<P>

117	An actuarial report of Peter Carroll dated 9 December 1998 calculates that
the loss of the nett benefit to be worth $54,972.
 As I have made a finding
that the plaintiff would have worked to 65 years in his current or similar
employment.  He would have been
entitled to superannuation upon retirement but
for the accident.  I allow the sum of $54,972 representing the present value of
the
loss of superannuation benefits.  
<P>

<b><u>Past and future care and assistance </u></b>
<P>

118	To determine the applicable amount to be awarded for home care services (s
151K) it has to be identified which services that
the plaintiff would
reasonably need, result from the defendant's wrong.  Or expressed another way
the plaintiff is to be compensated
for the loss of the plaintiff's capacity to
look after himself, which was caused by the accident - see <b><u>Van Gervan v
Fenton</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/54.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 54</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20327" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 327</a> - (s 151K(3)).  According to s 151K(3) no
compensation is to be awarded if these services would have been provided to the
plaintiff
had he not been injured.  In relation to the value of those services,
the parties have agreed on the maximum hourly and weekly rates
that can be
awarded.
<P>

119	It was submitted that the plaintiff has needed in the past and will need in
the future, a full time carer or 24 hour nursing
care.  The defendant submitted
that the plaintiff was not entitled to homecare services and respite care.
Alternatively the defendant
submitted that the plaintiff required 3 hours care
per week for the rest of his life.  
<P>

120	The difficult issue to determine is the nature of care and for what
duration it is required.  The care currently being provided
by the plaintiff's
wife is throughout the day and night except when she is at work on a shift from
5.00 am until 9.00 am.  She does
2 shifts one week and 3 shifts the following
week.  While she is away the plaintiff sleeps, watches videos or sometimes goes
to Mrs
Foster's daughter's house.  He attends Headway on an average of 7 hours
per week although at this time Mrs Foster is not working.
 Mrs Foster is not
constantly providing care for the whole of the time she spends with the
plaintiff and much of the care she provides
does not require constant activity.
She loves her husband and is prepared to continue to look after him for as long
as her health
allows her to do so.
<P>

121	The plaintiff is independent in personal care and hygiene.  He can dress,
wash, eat, walk, mow lawns.  He can and does assist
in domestic chores such as
vacuuming, mopping, hanging out clothes and going to the local shops to buy a
few items and collecting
his medication from the chemist.  He does not have
problems with alcohol and drug abuse.  The plaintiff can read books, in
particular
military history and the bible.  He can take himself to the local
shopping centre.  He can drive short distances in the local area
but of recent
times has been reluctant to do so.  
<P>

122	His wife cooks the majority of the meals and does the washing and I am
satisfied that these services would have been performed
by her had the accident
not occurred.  These tasks are not compensable pursuant to s 151K.  I note that
Dial an Angel in its report
dated 22 January 1998 estimates that preparing
meals takes about 10.5 hours per week.  I am not satisfied that she would have
been
solely responsible for the household shopping had the accident not
occurred.
<P>

123	
<P>

The plaintiff can become violent and although this occurs less than it used to,
it is impossible to predict when the violent outburst
will occur.  He still
becomes aggressive as shown by the recent incident referred to by Dr Craft.
The plaintiff is at high risk to
himself and others at night because of the
likelihood that he will precipitate himself out of bed, to wake up, shout,
commit noise,
wander around the house and fall down stairs.  To some extent the
risk of falling down stairs can be overcome if the plaintiff resides
in a
ground level dwelling.  He suffers epileptic fits which under current
medication are less frequent than they were although he
still has epileptiform
episodes.  He runs away from time to time and can become aggressive in shopping
centres when the queue is
too long.  However, in recent times he has become
socially withdrawn.  Both Doctors Langeluddecke and Middleton say that the
plaintiff
needs to be prompted to attend to hygiene and needs assistance with
domestic duties.
<P>

124	Mrs Foster is currently 55 years of age.  Like Dr Craft, Dr Yeo recommends
a paid live in housekeeper and after 15 years (from
1993) ie.,  10 years from
now institutional care will be necessary.  I accept this view.  Dr Yeo also
recommends a handyman for 4
hours per week (discussed later in this judgment)
and a companion/attendant for 8 hours per week.  I do not find that the
plaintiff
needs a companion/attendant.  The plaintiff can be left alone for
some periods otherwise he is looked after by his wife and she will
have the
benefit of respite periods.  Dr Craft says that after 10 years the plaintiff
will require at least a hostel or possibly
a nursing home or a regime of 24
hour care.  Dr Craft estimates that Mrs Foster will be physically well enough
to continue performing
these duties for another 10 years (t 127).  Even though
the plaintiff is independent in his personal hygiene, can stay at home
unsupervised
for several hours and can go to the local shops, he has required
in the past and will require in the future, full time assistance
for in excess
of 40 hours per week.  It is essential that someone checks that he is taking
his medication morning, noon and night
and hides the unused tablets, prompts
him to empty his bladder at these times and supervises his meals.  Even if he
resides in a
ground floor unit as Dr Craft suggests, it would also be necessary
for a carer to check on him from time to time throughout the night
due to his
jactitations, epileptic fits or epileptiform episodes.  He needs assistance to
travel to doctors and Headway.  
<P>

125	It is my view that the plaintiff's wife may work an average of 10 hours per
week and go to scouts one night per week.  She prepares
meals and does washing
which I estimate to take 15 hours per week.  These duties are non-compensable.
The plaintiff's wife can leave
the plaintiff alone for periods such as when she
works and at other times for an hour or more.  However, the plaintiff's
behaviour
is unpredictable.  Sometimes his psychological functioning is down to
less than 10% while at other times it is 70%.  (10% being a
dangerous psychotic
functioning state in which few holds are barred and many are unsafe). Much of
the time when she is supervising
the plaintiff all that she is doing is low
level supervision or simply attending to her own affairs albeit ensuring that
she is nearby
and "on call" in case she is needed.  Even so she is and has been
required to provide in excess of 40 hours care for the plaintiff
per week since
April 1991.  Section 151K provides the method of calculation where the services
provided are not less than 40 hours
per week.  Using the figures provided by
the parties I calculate past care at $233,336.30.
<P>

126	
<P>

For the next 10 years, that the plaintiff's wife will provide 138 hours per
week care which equates to 20 hours per day for 48 weeks
of the year.  At the
award rate the amount for care to be provided by Mrs Foster for the next 10
years (at $613 per week x 10 years
(multiplier 412.9)) equates to $253,107.70.
If market rates apply the amount for care for the next 10 years is $2,500 per
week (see
the following pages of the judgment for determination of appropriate
market rate).  This equates to $2,500 x 412.9 = $1,032,250.
 I will hear
further argument as to which rate is applicable bearing in mind s 151K(1).
<P>

127	After 10 years, the plaintiff could receive the appropriate level of care
in a hostel or community house for the following 14
years.  It would be
inappropriate to separate the plaintiff from his wife after she has cared for
him for the previous 18 years and
he is dependant upon her for emotional
support.  I have not been given details of the cost or availability of hostel
type accommodation
where both husband and wife could reside.  He has some
independence with daily living and this should be retained yet he needs full
time supervision.  
<P>

128	For Headway to supply 24 hour support, the service manager states that it
would involve 84 hours of support at $25 per hour
with 7 sleep overs per week
at $65 per night as well as 2 hours per week case management to co-ordinate at
$100 per hour.  The plaintiff's
living situation assessments and medical
appointments and any other ongoing needs to ensure him a better quality of
life.  This equates
$2,755 per week.
<P>

129	The Dial an Angel report stipulates the fee for a live-in
housekeeper/companion carer providing companionship, encouragement,
supervision
and general vigilance available at call 24 hours per day, 5 days per week is
$900 per week plus keep at $180 per day.
 This equates to $1,800 for 5 days
care.  This sum excludes leave entitlements.  If this amount is increased to
allow for 7 days
care it amounts to approximately $2,520.  Dial an Angel
recommends that in addition to the live in care, liver out care should be
provided on the basis of 2 to 4 hours per week, each visit consisting of 4 to 6
hours.  It is my view the need for the further live
out carer has not been
established.  In order to calculate the future care of the plaintiff for 14
years the rate I allow is the
sum of $2,500 per week for future care which will
become necessary after 10 years.  The multiplier for 24 years is 737.8 less
multiplier
for 10 years is 412.9 leaving 324.9.  $2,500 x 324.9 = $812,250.
<P>

<b><u>Headway</u></b>
<P>

130	Dr Luis recommended that the plaintiff attend Headway.  This is an
organisation that helps with rehabilitation, provides nursing
car and
activities for those suffering from head injuries.  The plaintiff has attended
activities at Headway in the past and enjoyed
them.  He would like to continue
to attend outings and activities with Headway.  Dr Craft and Dr Middleton
recommend that the plaintiff
continues to attend Headway and I am satisfied
that they should continue for his lifetime.  
<P>

131	The plaintiff's wife currently drives the plaintiff to and from Headway
which is approximately 3 kilometres from their home
on Mondays where he attends
woodwork from 3.00 pm until 3.30 pm.  This program is supervised by a qualified
instructor and the cost
is $3.00 per weekly session.  On Wednesday the
plaintiff goes ten pin bowling with Headway from 11.00 am until 1.00 pm.  He
walks
to the bowling alley as it is only about 250 metres from where he lives.
After bowling the Headway bus picks him up and takes him
to the Headway centre
where he does social and leisure activities at no cost and he returns home by
the Headway bus at approximately
4.30 pm.  The costs of bowling in 1998 was
$5.00 ($3.00 bowling plus $2.00 transport).  Every second Thursday the
plaintiff's wife
drives him to and from the Headway centre where he does
leather work from 1.30 pm until 3.30 pm.  The cost for this is $3.00 per
fortnightly session(t p 22).  The costs per week of these attendances are
approximately $9.50 per week for 24 years on 5% tables
- multiplier 737.8 =
$7,009.10.
<P>

132	Headway also hold an annual camp for one week which provides clients with
an opportunity to take a break from their living and
therapy situations, as
well as respite for their carers.  The costs of this is $100 for the week but
this does not include food and
expenses.  The plaintiff did not attend this
year due to his worsening condition.  I allow for the future attendance at this
camp
at Headway the sum of $1.92 per week x 737.8 = $1,416.58.  Total costs of
Headway is $8,425.68.
<P>

133	It is noted that the plaintiff has incurred $2,218.75 fees at Headway for
past attendance.  If these fees are not included in
the agreed out-of-pocket
expenses, and allowance should be made for them and I shall deal with it when
fund management is determined.
<P>

<b><u>Respite care</u></b>
<P>

134	As the plaintiff's wife will be providing constant care for 10 years she is
entitled to respite care.  She has requested one
week's respite every three
months.  This is a modest request and it is my view that it is necessary for
her to have a break on this
basis.  For Headway to supply 24 hour per day
support would involve 84 hours of support including 7 sleepovers per week as
well as
2 hours per week case management to co-ordinate the plaintiff's daily
living situation;  assessments, medical appointments and other
needs.  The
current fees are $100 per hour for case management, $25 per hour for a support
worker and $65 per night for a sleepover.
 Dial an Angel has also provided
details on the cost of respite care.  On this issue, I prefer Headway to
provide the services as
the plaintiff has some familiarity with this
organisation and is more likely to get the same carers each 3 months.  It is
difficult
to foresee how the plaintiff will react to his wife's absence for a
week each 3 months.  I have assessed the costs of care for the
plaintiff during
this time by Headway or a like organisation for 10 years based on the report of
Carroll and Ransom dated 10 December
1998 which calculates this amount to be
$87,204.
<P>

<b><u>Handyman and companion attendant</u></b>
<P>

135	Dr Yeo referred to the plaintiff's need for a handyman for 4 hours per
week.  The Dial an Angel report refers to the handyman/gardener
services as
including the replacement of tap washers, light globes, hosing paths, outside
window cleaning, minor carpentry repairs,
touch-up painting, lawn mowing,
garden maintenance, car washing, pet care and pool maintenance.  The video
evidence shows the plaintiff
is capable of lawn mowing.  In my view the
plaintiff is also capable of outside ground level window cleaning, garden
maintenance
and car washing.  However, he may not be capable of replacing
washers and light globes, touch-up painting and window cleaning at
above ground
level.  He would have been able to carry out these tasks but for the accident.
An allowance should be made for this
- 2 hours each 6 months at $22 per hour
ie., $88 per year for 24 years (multiplier 737.8 = $64,926.40.  No evidence has
been given
in relation to past handyman services.  Dr Yeo also says that the
plaintiff requires a companion attendant for 8 hours per week.
 This need for a
companion attendant has not been established.  The plaintiff will be cared for
by his wife for the next 10 years
and she will be afforded respite care.
Thereafter the plaintiff will receive care from a commercial organisation and
the plaintiff's
wife will continue to reside with him.
<P>

<b><u>Future Medication and medical treatment</u></b>
<P>

136	I turn to the plaintiff's current medication.  Currently the plaintiff
takes Rivotril 2 mgs x 8 per day;  Tegretol 200 mgs x
4 per day;  Lithium 250
mgs x 3 per day;  Adalat Oros 60 mgs am and Zoloft 200 mgs am.  The first two
of these are to guard against
his grand mal and psychomotor sequelae.  The
Lithium and Zoloft are to control severe mood disorder, Adalat is taken to
control high
blood pressure, the result in part of stress. It is my view that
the plaintiff will require this or similar medication for the rest
of his life.
It is agreed that the present weekly cost of the plaintiff's medication is
$47.43 per week.  The plaintiff will continue
to take a high level of
medication for the rest of his life.  I allow the amount of $47.43 for 24 years
(multiplier 737.8) = $34,993.85
for future medication.  It is not clear whether
this agreed figure includes the $3 per week cost of the Webster pack.  In my
view
it is necessary that the plaintiff continues to be supplied with this
medication pack and if no allowance has been made for it I
will make such an
allowance when the matter comes before me to deal with fund management.
<P>

137	Dr Craft spoke of the difficulties of ascertaining the right level of
medication and those which occur when the plaintiff is
taking such a high
dosage and the fact that the medication is adjusted on a weekly basis. It is my
view that the plaintiff will need
to be referred to other specialists for the
rest of his life on the same basis that is currently occurring.  It is my view
that it
is necessary for the plaintiff to continue to see Dr Craft on a weekly
basis for the rest of his life at $150 per visit.  
<P>

138	In terms of referral to medical experts Dr Craft refers the plaintiff to Dr
Maxwell, a neurologist one or twice per year in
regard to specific medication
problems.  As the plaintiff is on high dosages of medication which breach the
guidelines Dr Craft finds
it helpful to obtain a second opinion.  The plaintiff
is having increasing quantities of drugs in order to deal with the increasing
numbers of symptoms and these continued visits to other specialists will be
necessary.  Dr Craft also refers the plaintiff to Dr
Corbett in relation to the
plaintiff's epileptiform episodes which have increased in the last year or so.
Dr Craft has referred the
plaintiff to Dr Thompson a respiratory physician.

<P>

139	In addition, it is also necessary for the plaintiff to continue to be seen
by other specialists (including a neurologist) four
times per year at $150 per
visit.  The total costs for future medical treatment equates to $162 per week
for 24 years (multiplier
737.8) = $119,523.60.
<P>

<b><u>Fund Management</u></b>
<P>

140	The plaintiff requested that once damages have been assessed, the matter be
stood over to allow the amount of fund management
to be ascertained.  
<P>

<b><u>Fox v Wood</u></b>
<P>

141	It is agreed that, from the gross workers' compensation payments received
by the plaintiff, a total amount of $6,236 was deducted
as taxation.
<P>

<b><u>Out-of-pocket expenses</u></b>
<P>

142	The plaintiff's past out-of-pocket expenses have been agreed at
$37,741.28.
<P>

143	I propose to enter judgment in favour of the plaintiff as against the
defendant.  The cross claims are dismissed.  The matter
is to be stood over to
a date to be fixed for determination of fund management expenses, the
appropriate rate for care during the
next 10 years, clarification if the amount
for the Webster pack has been included in the agreed weekly costs of
medication, interest,
costs and to allow the parties to check my calculations
before judgment is entered.  If the parties can agree on any of these
outstanding
matters, consent orders can be handed up.
