<b>1117/98	BRIAN RAYMOND SILVIA &amp; ORS v COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION</b>
<P>

 
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

 
<P>

HIS HONOUR: 
<P>

1	This is an application under Pt 31 r 2 of the Supreme Court Rules for an
order that two questions be determined separately from
and prior to the other
issues in the proceedings.  Those questions are set out in the notice of
motion:
<P>

"(i)	Whether the receipt by the defendant of the amount of $600,000 on or about
24 October 1994 was the result of a transaction
or transactions to which the
second and/or third plaintiffs and the defendant were parties (even if someone
else was a party) and
whether that transaction or transactions resulted in the
defendant receiving the amount of $600,000 from the second and/or third
plaintiffs within the meaning of section 588FA of the Corporations Law.
<P>

(ii)	Whether the receipt by the defendant of the amount of $50,000 on or about
21 December 1994 was the result of a transaction
or transactions to which the
second plaintiff and the defendant were parties (even if someone else was a
party) and whether that
transaction or transactions resulted in the defendant
receiving the amount of $600,000 from the second plaintiff within the meaning
of section 588FA of the Corporations Law."
<P>

The proceedings are, in short, for the recovery of moneys paid by a company as
preferences under s 588FA of the Corporations Law.
 The other issues which
arise are a substantive defence that the payments were received by the
defendant in good faith and the defendant
had no reasonable grounds for
suspecting that either of the relevant companies was or would become insolvent.
There is also a cross
claim against directors which will be material if the
transactions referred to in the questions asked to be determined separately
are
set aside as preferences.
<P>

2	The motion is brought by the defendant in the proceedings and supported by
all the cross defendants, but opposed on behalf of
the plaintiff.  The
defendant and cross defendants contend that the questions sought to be
determined separately raise pure issues
of law to be determined upon the
documents.  The plaintiff does not concede that this is so.  The plaintiff says
that a number of
other contentions will be put on his behalf.  One is that the
payment of $50,000 referred to in the questions stands in quite different
circumstances from the payment of $600,000, in that the $50,000 payment came
directly out of the relevant company's bank accounts.
 Even as to the payment
of $600,000, he seeks to, and is entitled to, put the contention that, if not
only the principal document
which has been referred to is examined, but other
documents and other circumstances are taken into account, then that payment
also
can be correctly characterised as being received from the company, albeit
paid by some other person.
<P>

3	I have been referred, on the defendant and the cross defendants' behalf to
authority, in particular to what was said in <b>CBS Productions Pty Ltd v
O'Neill</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%201%20NSWLR%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 1 NSWLR 601</a> at 606 per Kirby P (as his Honour then was), and
to the decision of Needham J in <b>PKIU of Australia v Clark</b> (1976) 2
Ritchie's Supreme Court Procedure [13,006].  I do not, for a moment, dissent in
any way from the views expressed by those
learned judges.  However, it is most
important, if this procedure is to be used successfully, as indeed the learned
President pointed
out in the passage to which I was referred, that the occasion
for its use must be a clear occasion.  For instance, even things that
are said
to be purely questions of law in some circumstances need to be viewed for
proper decision in the context of surrounding
facts.  In my view, it is only in
quite clear cases that the separate determination of issues ought to be
ordered.  Great mischief
can be done in the conduct of the litigation if issues
are disarticulated from each other in circumstances which are inappropriate,
and it is, of course, often difficult to see, at a time long before the trial
and the full exposure of the issues in the case, what
the interrelation of
issues may be.
<P>

4	It seems to me on the material before me that there is room for, indeed,
perhaps, the likelihood of, the overlapping of issues
in this case, or the
reflection of one issue upon another, which makes it undesirable, in my
opinion, for the proposed questions
for separate determination to be determined
separately.  Certainly it is my view on the material before me that a clear
case for
the exercise of the discretion in favour of separate determination has
not been established.  In those circumstances I propose to
dismiss the notice
of motion.  The order of the Court therefore is that the defendant's notice of
motion filed on 22 March 1999 be
dismissed with costs.
