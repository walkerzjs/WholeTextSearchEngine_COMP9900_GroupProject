PROSECUTIONS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>	On 15 July 1998 Mr. Gregory Wayne Kable, ["the applicant],
filed three Notices of Motion, one in each of the three sets of proceedings,
the file numbers of which are noted above. Each Notice of Motion is in
identical terms and seeks the following relief:
<P>

	"1.	That leave be granted for the plaintiff to re-open the proceedings.
<P>

	2.	That the defendant should pay to the plaintiff the costs of the action:
and
<P>

	3.	Such further order/s as the Court thinks fit."
<P>

2	The Director of Public Prosecutions is respondent to each Notice of
Motion.
<P>

3	The background against which the Notices of Motion fall to be determined is
most conveniently explained in the form of a chronology.
I adopt for that
purpose the chronology forming part of the written submissions put in by
learned counsel for the respondent.
<P>

4	The following general chronology is common to all three of the present
Notices of Motion:
<P>

<b>6 December 1994 </b> - <i>Community Protection Act </i>assented to
<P>

<b>January 1995 </b>- Various interim orders made
<P>

<b>23 February 1995</b> - Levine J orders Mr. Kable to remain in custody until
22 August 1995
<P>

<b>9 May 1995 </b>- Court of Appeal  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2036%20NSWLR%20374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 36 NSWLR 374</a> dismisses appeal from
decision of Levine J
<P>

<b>12 September 1996 </b>- High Court <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20189%20CLR%2051" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 189 CLR 51</a> allows appeal from
decision of Court of Appeal.
<P>

5	The following chronology is particular to the proceedings numbered
11667/95:
<P>

<b>11 May 1995 </b>- Summons filed by Mr. Kable seeking revocation of orders
made 23 February 1995
<P>

<b>6 June 1995 </b>- Amended summons filed by Mr. Kable
<P>

<b>22, 23, 29, 30 June, 4, 7 July 1995</b> - Hearing before Sully J (Mr. Kable
represented by senior counsel)
<P>

<b>19 July 1995</b> - Sully J dismisses amended summons
<P>

<b>15 July 1998</b> - Mr. Kable files notice of motion seeking costs
<P>

6	The following chronology is particular to the matters 12469 of 1995 and 12775
of 1995:
<P>

<b>11 June 1995 </b> - Summons (12469/95) filed by Mr. Kable seeking revocation
of orders made 23 February 1995
<P>

<b>31 July 1995</b> - Summons (12775/95) filed by DPP seeking orders pursuant
to s5 of the Act
<P>

<b>14, 15, 16, 18 August 1995</b> - Hearing before Grove J (Mr. Kable
represented  by senior counsel in 12775/95)
<P>

<b>21 August 1995 </b>- Grove J refuses Mr. Kable's application for a
revocation, and also refuses the DPP's application for a second preventative
detention
order.
<P>

<b>15 July 1998</b> - Mr. Kable files notices of motion seeking costs in each
of 12469/95 and 12775/95
<P>

7	<b><i>Proceedings 12469/95</i></b> - When the three Notices of Motion were
called on for hearing, the applicant's solicitor intimated that the applicant
did not press
this particular Notice of Motion. I made a formal order
dismissing the Notice of Motion; and reserved any resulting question of
costs.
<P>

8	Had this particular Notice of Motion been pressed, it would have been dealt
with at the same time as the other two Notices of
Motion. That the Notice of
Motion was not pressed does not appear either to have added to, or to have
reduced, the costs entailed
in the contested hearing of the remaining two
Notices of Motion. Any costs particular in a strict sense to the abandoned
Notice of
Motion would be, as best I can judge from the available material,
<i>de minimis.</i>
<P>

9	In those circumstances, I think that the just course is to make no order as
to the costs of this particular Notice of Motion.
<P>

10	<b><i>Proceedings 11667/95 and Proceedings 12775/95</i></b> - Both these
Notices of Motion were heard together. The two Notices of Motion raise
identical issues for present decision. It is
convenient, therefore, to deal
with them simultaneously.
<P>

11	The first matter to be considered is the effect, for present purposes, of
the decision of the High Court of Australia striking
down the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1994270/" class="autolink_findacts">Community
Protection Act 1994</a></b>.
<P>

12	The essential point to be made in that regard is, in my opinion, that the
decision of the High Court did not have the effect
of creating retrospectively,
and for the benefit of the applicant, an entitlement to costs such as the
applicant now claims.
<P>

13	The relevant principles are not in doubt. They are discussed in terms
relevant to the present matters in the decision of the
Court of Criminal
Appeal: <b>Reg. v Unger</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%202%20NSWLR%20990" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 2 NSWLR 990:</a> see in particular per <b>Street
CJ</b> at 995B-G.
<P>

14	It follows, in my opinion, that the present applications must succeed, if
they are to succeed at all, upon some basis or bases
other than that decision
of the High Court of Australia. The applicant points, in that regard, to the
inherent power of this Court
to re-open, in a proper case, any of its
judgments; and to the cognate powers conferred by SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1994270/index.html#p40" class="autolink_findacts">Part 40</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1994270/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 9</a>; <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1994270/index.html#p20" class="autolink_findacts">part 20</a>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1994270/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 10</a>; <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1994270/index.html#p42" class="autolink_findacts">Part 42</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1994270/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 12</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1994270/index.html#p52" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1994270/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 1(c)</a> and (5).
<P>

15	As to SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1994270/index.html#p20" class="autolink_findacts">Part 20</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1994270/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 10</a>, it is sufficient to say that this particular Rule
addresses the correction of what is described by the Rule itself as "
...........
a clerical mistake, or an error arising from an accidental slip or
omission, in a minute of a judgment or order ........". The facts
of the
present matters do not fall within this Rule.
<P>

16	As to the other particular Rules of Court which I have earlier mentioned,
and as to any relevant inherent power of the Court,
it is not necessary, in my
opinion, to embark, in connection with the present applications, upon a
lengthy examination of the particular
Rules themselves; or to embark,
otherwise, upon an intricate discussion of legal principle. For, even if it be
assumed in favour
of the present applicant that the powers which he now prays
in aid do have the potential scope for which he now contends, it remains
the
fact that each and every one of such powers, whether inherent or not, is a
discretionary power.
<P>

17	Any discretionary power which falls to be considered in connection with the
present applications, must be exercised fairly in
the context of the facts and
circumstances particular to those applications. The relevant facts and
circumstances, as disclosed by
the evidence, seem to me to be these:
<P>

1.	The applicant did not seek from me in July 1995, and he did not seek from
Grove J in August 1995, an order for costs such as
he now seeks, or any other
costs order.
<P>

2.	On each of those earlier occasions, the applicant was represented by
experienced Senior Counsel.
<P>

3.	Subject to one exception to which I shall come presently, there is no
evidence before this Court, whether from the plaintiff,
from his Senior Counsel
, or from his solicitor, explaining why no application for costs was made on
either of those earlier occasions.
<P>

4.	The exception to what has just been said lies in the proposition, put orally
by the solicitor for the applicant during the course
of his oral submissions at
the recent hearing, that he had "overlooked" the potential availability of an
order for costs.
<P>

5.	I accept that what the applicant's solicitor thus said represents his honest
present recollection of what happened in 1995; although
I am bound to say that,
given the nature of the litigation in 1995 and the vigour with which it was
conducted, I find the suggestion
of such an oversight rather surprising.
<P>

6.	I think, however, that any advantage that might flow to the present
applications from an acceptance that there was, in fact,
such an oversight in
1995, - and on two distinct occasions at that, - is cancelled out by the
countervailing discretionary considerations
that go to what I might describe
compendiously as the public interest.
<P>

7.	Those considerations of public interest do not call for extended present
discussion. It is now something like 2-1/2 years since
the proceedings before
me, and subsequently before Grove J, were finalised in this Court. It would
take, in my opinion, a very clear
and a very compelling case to justify any
exercise in the applicant's favour of any discretionary power, now properly
available to
this Court, to re-open after such a lapse of time an issue as to
the applicant's entitlement, as now asserted, to costs. It suffices
to say that
I am wholly unpersuaded that such a case has been made out on the evidence
adduced by the applicant in support of the
present applications.
<P>

18	For the whole of the foregoing reasons, I have come to the conclusion that
the applicant has not established his entitlement
to the relief that he seeks
in his Notices of Motion. Both Notices of Motion are, accordingly, dismissed
with costs.
