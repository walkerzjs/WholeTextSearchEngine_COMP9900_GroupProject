<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:	The plaintiff is a Country Rugby League football club usually
called The Moree Boomerangs.  The plaintiff claims declarations
and an
injunction which would establish that a resolution of the General Committee of
the New England Group 19 Rugby League disqualifying
the plaintiff has no
effect.  The resolutions, or purported resolutions (and the plaintiff disputes
that they in fact were resolutions
of the General Committee) were to the
following effect:
<P>

	<i>"Having heard or read all the evidence and submissions the committee finds
that the Moree Boomerangs Club is guilty of any misconduct
or conduct
detrimental to the control, welfare or interest of the group or of Rugby League
football."</i>
<P>

<i>	"The following penalty is imposed:  disqualification.  Period of
disqualification:  one year."</i>
<P>

<i>	"Having voted in writing to find the Boomerangs Club guilty of misconduct
or conduct detrimental to the control, welfare or interest
of the group or of
Rugby League football and that a period of disqualification of one year be
imposed on the Club it is resolved
that the inquiry be now closed."</i>
<P>

2	In the Amended Summons of 16 April 1999 the plaintiff claims a declaration
that the resolutions are void and have no effect, a
declaration that in
purporting to conduct the inquiry and pass the resolutions the defendants
failed to afford procedural fairness
and natural justice to the plaintiff, a
declaration that the resolution calling the inquiry was null and void and of no
effect, and
an injunction restraining the defendant from proceeding with or
taking any steps to give effect to the resolution.  There is also
a claim for
an order establishing the identity of the members of the General Committee.
<P>

3	New England Group 19 is a Constituent Body of Country Rugby League of New
South Wales Inc.  (CRL).   CRL is incorporated and its
affairs are conducted in
accordance with a written constitution, by-laws and regulations; these are in
evidence.  CRL controls and
regulates the game of Rugby League football
throughout New South Wales, but relates to amateur sport and not professional
football.
 Although players receive some payments and small rewards and there
are financial arrangements among clubs, Country Rugby League
is not played
professionally and does not involve the livelihood interests of its
participants.  The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> of CRL is, I would think, a contractually
binding document on which members of CRL could base claims for damages or
equitable relief
for breaches of contract, as between members, and as between
each member and CRL.  
<P>

4	It is well accepted that the constitutions of incorporated clubs, even
amateur sporting and social clubs, are contractually binding,
and remedies are
sometimes claimed and granted on that basis.  Equitable remedies for breaches
of the constitutions of amateur sporting
and social clubs are rare, but from
time to time they are granted. Courts do not readily grant remedies against
unincorporated voluntary
associations carried on for amateur sporting or social
purposes, unless the interests of members in property or in gaining their
livelihood are affected.  This is not such a case.  
<P>

5	The plaintiff's claim is not based on the constitution of CRL, but on the
constitution of New England Group 19 of CRL.  The eight
defendants named in the
Summons are or acted as members of the General Committee of Group 19, and the
plaintiff claims orders to
identify all members of the General Committee.  It
is not possible to sue Group 19 because Group 19 is not incorporated; it is
possible
to sue all the members, or representative defendants appointed to
represent all members. The plaintiff's Summons shows that the plaintiff
wishes
to sue the members of the General Committee.  
<P>

6	The eight defendants named in the schedule to the Summons are Joe Barbato,
Bill Williams, Paul Ehsman, Paul McRae, Carol Khan,
Brian Davidson, Jack Alt
and Rod Stahlhut.  To be effective the orders which the plaintiff seeks would
have to be made in terms which
bound all members of the General Committee.
<P>

7	The plaintiff's solicitor gave me an Outline of Issues and the case was
structured by it.  Those Issues were:-
<P>

	<i>1.  Whether an inquiry can be properly called under rule 47 if all the
matters the subject of the inquiry have been the subject of
previous
proceedings, charges or disciplinary action.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.  In particular whether the so-called inquiry (the "inquiry") could
properly be called having regard to the charges brought against
the plaintiff
on 21.11.98 and the charge dealt with on 28.8.98.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.  Whether, even if the power under rule 47 could normally be used, in the
circumstances of the Court proceedings and the expressed
views of the Group and
the majority of the clubs to the effect that unless the plaintiff was removed
from the Group the Group would
not continue, the invoking of r. 47 would be in
bad faith or for a collateral purpose, namely to circumvent both judgements and
or
effectively exclude the plaintiff.</i>
<P>

<i>	4.  Whether the inquiry was properly called pursuant to r.31 or at
all.</i>
<P>

<i>	5.  Whether the First Defendant owed the Plaintiff a duty to apply the
principles of natural justice and or procedural fairness.</i>
<P>

<i>	6.  Whether the failure to answer properly or in some cases at all the
questions or certain of the questions raised in annexures
"E" and "F" to the
affidavit of John Ridley Sutton dated 26.3.99 constituted a breach of the rules
of natural justice and or procedural
fairness.</i>
<P>

<i>	7.  Whether the conduct of the inquiry on 29.3.99 breached the rules of
natural justice or procedural fairness.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.  In particular, whether:</i>
<P>

<i>	a.  the persons sitting on the inquiry tribunal were acting as prosecutors,
witnesses and or judges in the same cause;</i>
<P>

<i>	b.  there could be said to be apprehended bias;</i>
<P>

<i>	c.  there could be said to be actual bias;</i>
<P>

<i>	d.  there could be said to be a lack of good faith;</i>
<P>

<i>	e.  there could be said to be collateral, ulterior or extraneous
motives.</i>
<P>

<i>	9.  Whether the procedures adopted to complete the inquiry after
29.3.99:</i>
<P>

<i>	a.  were valid decisions within power of the constitution; or</i>
<P>

<i>	b.  constituted in any way a breach of the rules of natural justice and or
procedural fairness.</i>
<P>

<i>	10.  Whether the Resolutions said to have been passed 12 April 1999 were
valid resolutions under rule 17 or otherwise.</i>
<P>

<i>	11.  Whether the purported disqualification was in substance or effect an
expulsion and therefore without power.</i>
<P>

<i>	12.  Whether the penalty was so severe having regard to previous penalties,
notably the fine imposed on 28.8.98, and other penalties
on other clubs, as to
indicate bad faith or improper use of power."</i>
<P>

8	The requirements of procedural fairness when applied to this case revolve
around two principles.  One is "<i>no-</i> <i>one is to be the judge in his own
case</i>".  As everyone who could possibly be concerned in Group 19 affairs was
involved to some degree, the practical application of this
principle requires
that those who participated in the decision of the General Committee should not
have been biased but should have
been prepared to decide the charge on the
merits.  The second principle is "<i>hear each side" </i>and its practical
application is that as well as considering the matters of complaint in Exhibit
B the General Committee was required
to consider, and truly consider whatever
the plaintiff asked them to consider in answer.  It has to be added, in view of
the facts
in this case, that what they had to give the plaintiff was a
reasonable opportunity to answer the complaints; apart from cross-examining
Mr
Higgins for two hours, the plaintiff did not put anything before the General
Committee.  The hearing has to be a genuine one;
the Committee would not hear
each side if in fact the decision was predetermined and the hearing was only
the appearance of a hearing,
so that the information apparently considered
could not really have any influence.
<P>

9	There is an extensive review of judicial statements about what is required
for natural justice in the Opinion of the Privy Council
in <b>The University of
Ceylon v Fernando</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1960%5d%201%20WLR%20223" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1960] 1 WLR 223.</a>  That Opinion shows that there have
been many different formulations.  Authorities were also collected by Needham J
in <b>McNabb v Auburn Soccer Sports Club Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%201%20NSWLR%2055" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 1 NSWLR 55.</a>
<P>

10	The general approach of the Court to judicial control of decisions in
voluntary associations is expressed in the judgment of
Rich, Dixon, Evatt and
Mc Tiernan JJ in the High Court of Australia in <b>Cameron v Hogan</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1934/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1934] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281934%29%2051%20CLR%20358" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1934)
51 CLR 358</a> at 378 thus:
<P>

	<i>"The policy of the law is against interference in the affairs of voluntary
associations which do not confer upon members civil rights
susceptible of
private enjoyment."</i>
<P>

In the same case Starke J said at 384:
<P>

<i>	"As a general rule, the Courts do not interfere in the contentions or
quarrels of political parties, or, indeed, in the internal
affairs of any
voluntary association, society or club."</i>
<P>

		
<P>

11	The following passage in that judgment at page 370 was central to the
disposition of the case:
<P>

	<i>"Judicial statements of authority are to be found to the effect that,
except to enforce or establish some right of a proprietary nature,
a member who
complains that he has been unjustifiably excluded from a voluntary association,
or that some breach of its rules has
been committed, cannot maintain any action
directly founded upon that complaint.  For example, in <b>Forbes v Eden
</b>(1867) L.R. 1 Sc. &amp; Div. H.L., at p.581 Lord Cranworth said:</i>
<P>

<i>	Save for the due disposal and administration of property, there is no
authority in the Courts either of England or Scotland to take
cognizance of the
rules of a voluntary society entered into merely for the regulation of its own
affairs.</i>
<P>

<i>	Compare per Jessel M.R., <b>Rigby v Connol</b> (1880) 14 Ch. D., at p.487
per Barry J., <b>O'Keefe v Cardinal Cullen</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281873%29%20IR%207" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1873) I.R. 7</a> C.L., at p.343
Gavan Duffy J. considered that such statements should be understood as relating
only to the jurisdiction of Courts
of equity.  There are, however, reasons
which justify the statement that, at common law as well as in equity, no
actionable breach
of contract was committed by an unauthorized resolution
expelling a member of a voluntary association, or by the failure on the part
of
its officers to observe the rules regulating its affairs, unless the members
enjoyed under them some civil right of a proprietary
nature.  As a
generalization it expressed the result produced by the application of a number
of independent legal principles:  it
is not in itself the enunciation or
explanation of a rule or rules of the common law.  One reason which must
contribute in a great
degree to produce the result is the general character of
the voluntary associations which are likely to be formed without property
and
without giving to their members any civil right of a proprietary nature.  They
are for the most part bodies of persons who have
combined to further some
common end or interest, which is social, sporting, political, scientific,
religious, artistic or humanitarian
in character, or otherwise stands apart
from private gain and a material advantage.  Such associations are established
upon a consensual
basis, but, unless there were some clear positive indication
that the members contemplated the creation of legal relations inter
se, the
rules adopted for their governance would not be treated as amounting to an
enforceable contract.  (Compare per Jessel M.R.,
<b>Rigby v Connol</b> (1880)
14. D., at p. 487, and per Scrutton L.J., <b>Rose and Frank Co. v. J.R.
Crompton and Bros. Ltd.</b> (1923) 2 K.B., at p. 288."</i>
<P>

12	Their Honours required an approach to the constitution of a voluntary
association on the basis that the constitution was unlikely
to deal with rights
in property, and would not be treated as amounting to an enforceable contract
unless there was some clear positive
indication of an intention to create legal
relations.  As I show later, there is such an indication for the Group 19
constitution.
<P>

13	Their Honours' view about the general character of voluntary associations
and the likely intended effect of their constitutions
is, I would think,
capable of reconsideration after the passage of almost 65 years, as it is based
on the experience of the times
of the judges who then spoke.  However that
reconsideration cannot be given by any Court bound by the law as established in
<b>Cameron v Hogan</b>, and by the authoritative statements made in that case
that the policy of the law is against interference in the affairs of voluntary
associations.
<P>

14	Their Honours referred to several considerations of which a different
appraisal could now be made.  One was the difficulties
of enforcement of
contractual rights against a voluntary association of which the plaintiff is
one member, or against a body the
members of which cannot be clearly
established, having regard to the procedural law and to practical difficulties
which it created
for actions against large numbers of co-contractors;
procedural reforms have made this less pressing now, and representative
proceedings
are more readily available.  Their Honours also referred to
difficulties of enforcing a judgment for damages, and this is less pressing
if
the judgment is declaratory or an injunction restrains conduct in breach by
named officers.  Their Honours returned at page 373
to the difficulties of
relief where the basis on which it is granted is the enforcement of a contract,
and those difficulties were
significant for their conclusion.  
<P>

15	The Courts are now more ready than they were in 1934 to grant equitable
remedies for contractual breaches, even in the absence
of some proprietary
interest, and much more ready to protect opportunities to pursue an occupation
(which was the subject of dispute
in <b>Cameron v Hogan</b>) whether or not the
impediment is contractually based.  The High Court has not had occasion to
reconsider <b>Cameron v Hogan, </b>and the law established in 1934 remains
binding.  
<P>

16	Unless litigation relates to protection of the important subjects of the
protection of livelihood interests and property rights,
the policy against
intervention stated in 1934 is just as pressing a consideration now as it was
then.  If a voluntary association
relates only to sporting or social purposes I
see nothing of substance to be achieved by the State and its judiciary making
themselves
responsible for resolution of internal disputes about who shall be
members or who shall be officers.  It is not practical to hope
that persons can
be compelled to remain in voluntary association together or that their
association will flourish under legal compulsion;
if people were compelled to
continue in an association on a basis which they no longer wished for, they
readily could and readily
would desist from associating together.  Liberty of
association is a deeply held value and includes liberty to chose with whom one
will associate, and it cannot effectually be controlled.  A policy in which the
Courts intervene where economic interests are affected,
but do not otherwise
involve themselves in sporting or social clubs, appears to me to set the
appropriate outer boundary for Law's
Empire.  Persons who wish to have
arrangements which are justiciable can readily do so by incorporating their
club, as many have
done.  (Even for them, the grant of equitable remedies is
discretionary).
<P>

17	In <b>McKinnon v Grogan</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%201%20NSWLR%20295" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] 1 NSWLR 295</a> Wootton J in this Division
concluded that members of the New South Wales District Rugby League Football
Club, an unincorporated voluntary
association, had standing to seek remedies
relating to the proper method of conducting the club's affairs.  Wootton J
expressed dissatisfaction
with the decision in <b>Cameron v Hogan</b>.  Wootton
J's judgment is based on his conclusion that the rules of the club were
intended to be legally binding - at 299:
<P>

	<i>"In my opinion, people who join the League and subscribe to its
constitution and by-laws should be taken to intend to be bound by
them and
should be entitled to envoke the courts in appropriate circumstances to have
their dispute settled.  What limitations, if
any, should be placed on this
right is, no doubt, something to be worked out case by case."</i>
<P>

His Honour based this on a view of the importance of the affairs and regulation
of Rugby League as perceived by members of the League,
and by him, and did not
look for "...<i>some clear positive indication that the members contemplated
the creation of legal relations inter se" </i>in any other source.  
<P>

18	<b>McKinnon v Grogan </b>was not a decision upon the present constitution of
CRL.  In 1975 the League and its clubs were all voluntary associations.  The
way
in which Rugby League affairs, including the Country Rugby League, are
conducted has since been entirely recast, and the choice between
incorporating
CRL and forming its constituent bodies as voluntary associations must be
understood to be significant. 
<P>

19	The present constitution of CRL shows that its members are, for the most
part, individuals.  (See Clause 6a).  By Clause 4 "<i>The League shall be
composed of the following constituent bodies..."</i> and a number of
constituent bodies are named.  These constituent bodies are represented by
delegates at the Annual Conference.  It
seems that individuals are members but
they participate through constituent bodies.  By Clause 5 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>
of CRL:  "<i>Each constituent Body shall be bound by and operate under this
constitution and all by-laws and regulations made thereunder and shall
also be
bound by and operate under its own constitution and the by-laws and regulations
made thereunder except to the extent that
such last mentioned constitution is
repugnant to this constitution...."</i> Provisos enable a Group to vary its
constitution.
<P>

20	Group 19 adopted its Group <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> in a standard form for Group
Constitutions, with a few amendments.  Clause 2 of the Group <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>
provides:  
<P>

	<i>"This constitution shall be deemed to have been adopted by the Group and
shall take effect in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 5</a> of the constitution of the League."
</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>In my opinion this shows a clear positive intention that the Group
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> shall be contractually binding, of the kind contemplated in
<b>Cameron v Hogan.</b>
<P>

21	The Balance Sheet of Group 19 as of July 31, 1998 is included in Exhibit C.
That shows assets valued at $19,510.33 consisting
of a current account,
accounts receivable, an investment account, petty cash and some plant and
equipment.  There are liabilities
of $872.00.  That is, property interests are
involved in membership of Group 19.  They are not of significant value, in
relation
to any particular club, and their enjoyment is only indirectly
involved in the disqualification.
<P>

22	In my opinion there is power to enforce the provisions of the Group 19
constitution by equitable remedies.  The power is discretionary.
<P>

23	In the Group <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> references to members appear to refer to
individuals who are members of the CRL, but they participate in Group affairs
largely through
delegates of clubs who attend the Annual Meeting and the
General Committee. Group 19 conducts a First Division competition with teams
from clubs at Armidale, Guyra, Glen Innes, Inverell, Warialda and Moree, and a
Second Division with teams from Armidale known as
Armidale YCW and Narwon and
teams from Uralla, Walcha and Tingha.  The affairs of Group 19 other than at
Annual General Meetings
are managed by a General Committee and an Executive
Committee.  The General Committee has wide powers of management and a power of
adjudication in Clause 47 and 48 in these terms:
<P>

	<i>"47.  The General Committee may call upon any Club or Constituent League
within the Group to make proper inquiry or itself may inquire
or cause to be
inquired into any matter which in its opinion in any manner affects the
control, welfare and/or interest of the Group
or of any Constituent League or
of any club or of Rugby League Football.  Failing compliance with any such
direction the General
Committee may take such disciplinary action as it thinks
fit against the Club or Constituent League so failing and/or against any
player, coach, employee, official or other like person found upon inquiry by
the General Committee to have been guilty of misconduct
or conduct detrimental
to the welfare, control and/or interest of the Group or of any Constituent
League or of any Club or of Rugby
League Football." </i>
<P>

<i>	"48.  Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing the General
Committee may disqualify, fine or otherwise deal with any
Club or Constituent
League found guilty of any misconduct or conduct detrimental to the control,
welfare or interest of the Group
or of any Constituent League or of any Club or
of Rugby League Football or of any breach of this constitution or any by-law
made
thereunder or of any breach of the constitution of the League or any
by-law or regulation made thereunder or of non-compliance with
any direction
issued under the authority of this constitution or any by-law made
thereunder."</i>
<P>

24	Membership of the General Committee is regulated by Clause 6 and consists of
six officers, one representative of the Referees'
Association, two delegates
from each first grade club and one delegate from other clubs; members may be
co-opted.  Clubs may appoint
delegates and alternates and may appoint others
from time to time.  The members or purported members of the General Committee
at
the meeting of 29 March 1999 are set-out in Exhibit 1. 
<P>

25	The Group also has an Executive or Executive Committee of Group 19 consists
of three officers - Clause 31:
<P>

	<i>"The President, Secretary and Treasurer shall constitute and act as the
Executive and may, subject to the directions of the General
Committee, but
otherwise without any exception or qualification whatsoever, exercise all or
any of the powers by the constitution
and/or any by-law made thereunder
conferred upon the General Committee PROVIDED THAT in the case of any
contentious question or matter
in which any Rugby League Football organisation
with which any member of the Executive is directly associated or involved the
place
of such member upon the Executive shall for all purposes connected with
such question or matter be taken by the Senior Vice President
or if he is
similarly associated with the organisation so involved by a Vice President
selected by the other members of the Executive
for such purpose."</i>
<P>

26	Narration of the controversy which led to the litigation can begin with a
First Division game played between the Moree Boomerangs
and Glen Innes at Mead
Park, Glen Innes on Sunday 23 August 1998.  The game ended in the 31st minute
when the Moree Boomerang players
walked off.  There were complaints and
protests from various sources.  A meeting of the General Committee on Saturday
28 August 1998
passed these resolutions:
<P>

	<i>"Brian Davidson, Greg Jones moved that the Moree Boomerangs be fined $500
for behaviour detrimental to the game of Rugby League and
the damage to the
Glen Innes dressing rooms be compensated.  Carried.  Tom French and Doug
McGrady wished their vote against the
motion be recorded.  </i>
<P>

<i>	.......Moved Carol Khan/Bill Williams that the Moree Boomerangs be placed
on notice that should any further incidents occur before
the end of the season
they will be stood down immediately and their affiliation for 1999 could be in
jeopardy.   Carried.  Tom French
and Doug McGrady wished their vote against be
recorded."</i>
<P>

27	At the Annual General Meeting on Sunday 8 November 1998 a resolution was
carried to the effect:
<P>

	<i>"That all affiliations for 1999 be accepted with the exception of the Moree
Boomerangs Club."</i>
<P>

At a meeting of the General Committee on 7 December 1998 a decision was made to
the effect that the plaintiff was excluded from
affiliation within the
Group.
<P>

28	In proceedings 4666 of 1998 the plaintiff obtained decisions of this Court
(Hamilton J) on 15 December 1998 to the effect that
the General Committee and
the Annual General Meeting did not have power to pass those resolutions.  
<P>

29	On 23 January 1999 a meeting of the Boundary and Competition Committee of
the CRL - not a committee of Group 19 - considered
the alteration to the
boundaries of Group 19 and which clubs should compete in the competition to be
conducted by Group 19 in 1999.
 
<P>

30	On 3 February 1999 the Boundary and Competition Committee decided to alter
the boundaries of the Group 19 competitions in a way
which excluded the Moree
Boomerangs and determined that a number of clubs would participate in the Group
19 competitions for 1999
without including the Moree Boomerangs.  On 17 March
1999 this Court (Windeyer J) determined that the Boundary and Competition
Committee
did not have power to do that.
<P>

<i>31	</i>On 18 March 1999 the Executive Committee of Group 19 consisting of
the President Bill Williams, the Treasurer Brian Davidson and the
Secretary
Carol Khan decided to convene a meeting of the General Committee for Monday 29
March 1999 at the Glen Innes Services Club
to commence at 7.45 pm.  Their
resolution referred to Rule 13(a) which empowers the Executive Committee to
call a meeting of the
General Committee at any time.  The Secretary Carol Khan
sent Colin Wells, Acting President of the plaintiff, a letter of charge
on 19
March 1999 (which was corrected in minor ways by an amended letter of 22 March
1999) which said to the effect that the General
Committee would meet:  
<P>

<i>	"...to inquire into allegations of misconduct by your club through its
players and/or supporters during the season 1998 being matters
which effect the
control and welfare of the Group and of Rugby League Football and which may be
found to be detrimental to the control,
welfare or interest of the Group or
Club within the Group."</i>
<P>

32	The letter went on to give particulars referring to the incidents referred
to in the minutes of 28 August 1998 and the conduct
of the plaintiff's players
at matches on 5 September and 8 September 1998 and also the conduct of the
club's officials and supporters
on all three occasions.  
<P>

33	On 22 March 1999 the plaintiff's solicitors wrote to the defendant's
solicitors protesting against the letter of charge.  It
was said that the
letter was extraordinary and an attempt to circumvent the effect of both
judgments and that it purported to reopen
matters all of which have been the
subject of previous charges.  These observations were not correct as there had
not earlier been
any charges dealing with the events of 5 and 8 September and
the charges had not been previously determined, while the decisions
which the
judgments of this Court showed to be invalid were not determinations of
charges.  The plaintiff's solicitors said of the
letter of charge:
<P>

	<i>"It is a document with BAD FAITH writ large upon it."</i>
<P>

and went on to ask for particulars of who had called the meeting and what Rule
it was called under.  In another letter on the following
day they sought
particulars of the subject of the Inquiry.
<P>

34	The defendant's solicitors gave particulars on 25 March 1999 by reference to
a file of about 20 pages of lists of complaints,
letters of complaints, reports
from referees and other matters.  This file is Exhibit B.  
<P>

35	On 29 March 1999 the plaintiff, represented by Mr John Sutton, solicitor,
applied to this Court (Young J) for an interlocutory
injunction restraining the
holding of the meeting, which was refused.  The General Committee meeting was
held at the Glen Innes Services
Club commencing at 8.00 pm.  No representative
of the plaintiff was present at that time.  Four representatives of the
plaintiff
arrived at 8.20 pm.  The honorary solicitor of the Group, Mr Watt,
presented business relating to the Inquiry and read letters of
allegations.
There was some discussion about whether the plaintiff's representatives wished
to hear all the material read out.  Mr
Sutton, who travelled from Sydney that
day after appearing before Young J, arrived at 8.50 pm. 
<P>

36	Mr Sutton obtained a short adjournment.  Then he is recorded in the Minutes
as having made some observations about procedure.
 According to the Minutes he
requested that letters of allegation written by two persons who were not
present should not be read;
he inquired whether two referees were present and
was told they were not; he was told that Mr Higgins (the referee at the game on
23 August) was available and said that he wished to ask him questions. He
questioned Mr Higgins from 9.24 pm until he finished at
11.20 pm after
interjections by various members of the meeting expressing concern at the
nature of the questions and the length of
the meeting.  After questioning Mr
Higgins he said that the Moree Boomerangs had a large number of witnesses and
as recorded in the
Minutes he advised the meeting that he would submit written
statements from these witnesses and forward them to Mr Watt.  The Minute
says
"<i>Mr Watt agreed to discuss format with Mr Sutton after the meeting's
completion</i>".
<P>

37	Late in the meeting a motion was moved by delegates of Warialda "<i>that
every A Grade Club that nominated in Group 19 be allowed to play in 1999".
</i>After discussion this motion was defeated.  In the course of the discussion
a delegate from Guyra said that his club was not prepared
to play if the
boundary was not changed and a delegate from Inverell made a similar
observation.
<P>

38	Mr Sutton submitted to me that the debate on this motion and the fact that
it was defeated demonstrated that the proceedings
were unfair and that the
outcome of the charges was pre-determined.  There is no substance in this; what
is demonstrated by the fact
that that motion was not carried was that the
meeting was not prepared to decide in accordance with the motion. 
<P>

39	The meeting concluded when the President of Group 19 said that he regretted
that the matter was not decided at that meeting and
a further meeting would be
called for Tuesday, 6 April 1999 commencing at 7.30 pm at the Glen Innes
Services Club.  The meeting closed
at 11.30 pm.
<P>

40	On 5 April 1999 the Group Secretary Carol Khan sent a message to all members
of the General Committee which said that in view
of the length of the meeting
on 29 March the Executive Committee had decided to postpone the resumption of
the meeting to 13 April
and in the mean time to submit a resolution in writing
pursuant to Clause 17.  The message said:
<P>

	<i> "Members have already heard the evidence presented to the last meeting and
further evidence in writing will be presented to you on
behalf of the Moree
Boomerangs.  You must consider this further evidence along with any written
submissions made on behalf of the
Moree Boomerangs </i><cite>BEFORE
</cite><i>you vote on the resolution." </i>
<P>

41	A vote was called for by 3.00 pm on 12 April 1999.  The proposed written
resolutions were:
<P>

	<i>1.  In view of the length of the meeting of the General Committee on 29
March, 1999 and the distance travelled on that date and to
be travelled in
future to complete the inquiry it is resolved that the inquiry be completed by
resolutions pursuant to Clause 17
of the Group's Rules.</i>
<P>

<i>		YES      		NO     	(Please tick or cross)</i>
<P>

<i>	2.  Having heard or read all the evidence and submissions the committee
find that the Moree Boomerangs Club is </i>
<P>

<i>	GUILTY              NOT GUILTY        (Please tick or cross).</i>
<P>

<i>	of misconduct or conduct detrimental to the control, welfare or interest of
the Group or of Rugby League Football.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.  In the event that the Moree Boomerangs Club is found guilty in
accordance with resolutions above, the following penalty is imposed:</i>
<P>

<i>	FINE				(Please tick or cross).</i>
<P>

<i>	AMOUNT OF FINE    $                            (Please insert
amount)</i>
<P>

<i>	DISQUALIFICATION		(Please tick or cross).</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	PERIOD OF DISQUALIFICATION</i>
<P>

<i>	1 YEAR        2 YEARS      3 YEARS   (Please tick or cross).</i>
<P>

<i>	OTHER PENALTY		         (Please insert).</i>
<P>

42	On 1 April Mr Watt had sent Mr Sutton a copy of this document with a message
which said:
<P>

	<i>"We still do not have your statements and submissions.  Please provide same
by Tuesday 6th April 1999 so that they can be circulated."</i>
<P>

Mr Watt sent Mr Sutton a further message on 8 April asking for the statements
by the following day.
<P>

	<i>".....as it is proposed that the rest of the Inquiry will be dealt with by
way of your written submissions."</i>
<P>

Mr Watt also asked for a submission dealing with any matters relating to
penalty in the event of the General Committee arriving
at a finding of
misconduct.  On 9 April 1999 Mr Watt sent Mr Sutton's firm a letter by
facsimile message further calling for evidence
and submissions.
<P>

43	On 12 April 1999 Mr Sutton's firm responded by letter sent by facsimile
message, the first response since 1 April. The letter
protested against the
procedure which had been followed.  The letter asserted that Mr Sutton had been
advised that the plaintiff
would have the opportunity to question any witness
who had submitted evidence, that Mr Sutton had said that he would be
questioning
adverse witnesses and would call a number of witnesses, and it was
attributed to Mr Watt that he said that he expected that the plaintiff
would
need to call witnesses to give live evidence.  Mr Sutton said:
<P>

	<i>"It now appears that the goal posts are being moved once again confirming
the view we expressed to his Honour Mr Justice Young that
the result of this
Inquiry is already determined and that the whole procedure would be a traversty
of the constitution and the rules
of fairness.</i>
<P>

<i>	We rely upon the procedure that was set by your own clients and which was
made known to us at the inquiry.  At this stage we do not
wish to submit
written statements.  We require that we be given the opportunity promised us
that we could question all adverse witnesses.
 We wish to do that before we, in
effect, mount our own case.  If you do not afford us this opportunity as
promised you do so at
your own peril."</i>
<P>

44	The Executive Committee received responses from club delegates and other
General Committee members and concluded from the responses
that the General
Committee had found the plaintiff guilty.  On 13 April 1999 the Executive
Committee issued a press release and informed
club secretaries that the meeting
set down for 13 April had been cancelled.  The General Committee members were
then asked to vote
on a further written resolution which was in these terms:
<P>

	<i>"Having voted in writing to find the Boomerangs Club guilty of misconduct
or conduct detrimental to the control, welfare or interest
of the Group or of
Rugby League football and that a period of disqualification of one year be
imposed on the club it is resolved
that the inquiry be now closed."</i>
<P>

The Executive Committee later concluded from the responses 
<P>

	that that resolution had been carried.  
<P>

45	The decision to disqualify the plaintiff is ineffective if it fails on
grounds which fall into two different classes.  One is
non-compliance with
steps which are necessary under the Group <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> for an effective
decision to disqualify.  The other is non-compliance with the requirement that
procedures must be followed in good
faith and must be fair: that is, the
requirement of natural justice.  In my opinion it is a necessary implication in
Clauses 47 and
48 that a club will not be disqualified as a disciplinary
measure in any other way than in accordance with the procedure in Clauses
47
and 48, and also that any exercise of the power to impose disqualification will
be carried out fairly and in good faith.  These
are conditions of the
effectiveness of any disqualification.
<P>

46	The principal contention put to me by Mr Sutton was that  when the whole
course of the events from August 1998 until April 1999
is considered, it should
be found that the outcome of the Inquiry was pre-determined, that there was no
real possibility of consideration
in good faith by the General Committee of the
business under Clause 47 and Clause 48 and that the plaintiff was going to be
disqualified
come what may.  In my view the facts should not be found in that
way.  One basis put forward for that conclusion was that the complaint
itself
was lacking in substance, and that there was not a reasonable basis for the
view that the information put before the General
Committee justified the
conclusion that there was misconduct, or conduct detrimental as in Clause 47.
The facts are to the contrary;
it was well within the range of reasonable
conclusions on the complaints in Exhibit B that the charge should be upheld.
That being
so, conduct which continued to further the complaints in the letter
of charge through various unsuccessful procedural courses over
earlier months
does not ground the conclusion argued for.  The conclusion which it tends to
ground is that there was a genuine belief
that there really was something to be
considered and decided.  Apart from the disciplinary resolution of 28 August
1998 none of the
later resolutions had been effectual at all.  None of the
judicial decisions had established or dealt with whether there was or was
not
any substance in the matter of the charge. 
<P>

47	It was contended on behalf of the plaintiff that inclusion in the
particulars of events of 23 August 1998 which had been the
subject of a
disciplinary decision and penalty on 28 August 1998 showed that the proceedings
were unfair.  The ground referred to
in Clause 48 on which disqualification may
be imposed is misconduct or conduct detrimental to the control, welfare or
interest of
the Group or of Rugby League football, and the particulars referred
to the cumulative effect of a series of events at three games,
the first being
that of 23 August 1998.  The range of matters which could be found to be
misconduct or conduct detrimental to the
control, welfare or interest of the
Group or of Rugby League football is very wide and is left by the Group
constitution to the judgment
of the General Committee.  If the General
Committee acts in good faith and fairly it can come to its own decision about
the impact
on the whole matter under consideration of the fact that part of the
facts under consideration have already been the subject of disciplinary
action;
and on any other questions involved, including the responsibility to be
attributed to the club for the behaviour of players,
officers or supporters.
The decision of 28 August 1998 included an indication of further action if
there were any further incidents
that season.  Under the general law a previous
conviction is excluded for policy reasons, although it is relevant.  In my
judgment
bringing the events of 23 August 1998 under consideration again in the
way indicated in the complaint is not an indication of lack
of good faith or of
unfair procedure.  
<P>

48	Mr Sutton also contended that procedural unfairness was shown by the fact
that earlier decisions of Group 19 bodies and the Boundary
and Competition
Committee on similar or the same facts had been found to be ineffective by
Court decisions.  As the Court decided,
the earlier decisions based on those
facts were ineffective, there is no reason for treating the earlier decisions
as conclusive
of the matters in the charge.
<P>

49	It was contended that by undertaking the inquiry the Group had shown a
determination to circumvent the judgments of the Court.
 It must be said that
this contention was entirely groundless, and there is no event which could be
thought of as circumventing a
Court decision.  
<P>

50	It was contended that the proceedings were unfair in that the particulars
were inadequate as they did not give enough indication
of what was being
inquired into.  I do not accept this complaint; in the name of particulars the
plaintiff was furnished with all
the information which was proposed to be put
before the General Committee, and, so far as the evidence shows, all the
information
which was put before the General Committee, apart from
cross-examination by the defendant's solicitor of the referee Mr Higgins.
 The
plaintiff was given more than particulars:  it was given everything that was
put before the General Committee.
<P>

51	Regard has to be kept steadily on the nature of the General Committee .
Group 19 has a huge territory from Glen Innes to Walcha
to Moree, and
assembling a General Committee from nine different cities and towns involves a
large number of people in lengthy journeys.
 It is difficult for meetings to be
extended beyond a few hours.
<P>

52	A standard of procedural fairness must be understood to be inapplicable if
as a matter of practicality it would prevent a decision
from emerging.  All
parties are committed to be bound by decisions of the General Committee, and
procedural short-comings which are
inherent in the way the General Committee is
constituted cannot be a ground for invalidating its decision.
<P>

53	Officers of the Group and delegates of clubs will in the nature of things
have some involvement in the affairs on which the General
Committee has to
reach a conclusion.  The General Committee and the officers were not
disqualified from considering the charge and
from exercising its powers under
the Rules, and from conducting Group business by the fact that they had
continued participation
in and conduct of Group affairs.  Unless someone
carried them on they could not be carried on, and unless the Executive
Committee
thought there was something worthy of consideration, business would
never receive consideration.  There is no equation between a
wish to have a
disciplinary measure considered on the one hand and bad faith or bias on the
other hand.  
<P>

54	On the need for actual bias see <b>Australian Workers' Union v Bowen (No 2)

<P>

55	Delegates attend the General Committee as delegates of clubs: they can be
expected to express the feelings of their clubs and
to act on them.  Delegates
of football clubs cannot be turned into discreet Elder Statesmen.  On the
Warialda motion on 29 March
the Guyra and the Inverell delegates frankly did
express the feelings of their clubs.  Stating their clubs' attitudes was what
they
were there to do, and a standard of behaviour imposed by the Court would
be unrealistic if it did not recognise that club delegates
will speak openly in
that way.  What they do is not tested for lack of involvement: it is tested for
lack of bias.  If the fact that
Guyra was not prepared to play unless the
boundary was changed was a relevant thing to say in debate on the motion, it
would have
been wrong to keep quiet about it.  It said nothing about the
charges against the Moree Boomerangs and in my opinion it shows involvement
but
does not show bias.
<P>

56	The Executive  initiated the complaint and the three members of the
Executive participated in the deliberations to the General
Committee.  However
they did not in my opinion take the part of the prosecutor, or of a witness;
they did not originate any of the
information on the nature of the complaint,
and in view of the nature of the information furnished to them by complainants
they could
hardly have done otherwise than to bring the matter before the
General Committee for its consideration, if they were functioning
as an
Executive in a proper way.  These are not disqualifying circumstances.  
<P>

57	A person who took the role of prosecutor, or a person who was shown actually
to be biased against the plaintiff could not, consistently
with a fair outcome,
participate in its decisions; but there is no basis for a finding of actual
bias against any of the delegates
or officers, and the position of prosecutor
was taken by the honorary solicitor Mr Watt.  Standards which required that,
for example,
Executive Committee Members who took part in the decision to call
a meeting of the General Committee or to put the charge before
it were
disqualified from participation, or which disqualified a delegate who had
opposed what was in effect a closure motion and
expressed the view of the club
that he represented that they would not participate unless there was a certain
outcome, impose a standard
of purity which as a matter of practicality cannot
be expected of a body of this kind.  
<P>

58	For a Court, or a public authority or tribunal with a salaried staff,
stricter standards would be expected.  A voluntary association,
largely
composed of representatives of football clubs with a quite direct interest in
the quality of participation of other clubs,
cannot be required to conform to
the standards imposed in public administration. Clubs have no real
opportunities for ready substitution
for persons who disqualify themselves,
having regard for the considerations of time and distance and the voluntary
nature of the
Group.
<P>

59	The cross-examination of Mr Higgins, who was referee on 23 August 1998,
demonstrates the limits of practicality.  The cross-examination
related very
largely to the events of the game of 23 August, took almost two hours and
terminated at 11.20 pm.  That was a lot of
attention for a game which lasted 31
minutes.  In the world of practicalities the Court cannot expect that a
committee of 28 persons
from widely separated country districts would continue
to reassemble itself from time to time for long enough to enable this kind
of
examination of each complainant the plaintiff chooses to cross-examine to take
place.  The events of 29 March demonstrate the
impracticability of allowing
cross-examination of all persons furnishing information which the General
Committee was to consider.
 
<P>

60	As a general proposition, domestic tribunals are not required to allow
cross-examination, and I was not referred to any particular
circumstances of
this case which make that general approach inapplicable; this is not for
example a case which could turn on a detailed
consideration of the credibility
of a small number of participants in an event. After particulars had been given
in the full form
in Exhibit B, the requirements of fair procedure included
giving the plaintiff an opportunity to put before the General Committee
any
factual information which it wished the Committee to consider; they did not
extend to allowing cross-examination or a confrontation
with all informants, or
indeed with any informants.  The conversations between Mr Watt and Mr Sutton
after the meeting of 29 March
and on 1 April, the exact details of which were
disputed, whatever else was said, kept before Mr Sutton and the plaintiff the
opportunity
to bring forward written statements and submissions for
consideration.  Indeed, the opportunity to do that should in reality have
suggested itself to Mr Sutton and the plaintiff before 29 March, and their
preparation would have been a better use of time than
pursuing unsuccessfully
an interlocutory injunction.  The need for written statements was obvious.  
<P>

61	A change in the procedure which has been earlier indicated has been frowned
on when it occurs in the proceedings of a public
body; see <b>Attorney-General
of Hong Kong v Ng Yuen Shui</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1983/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] UKPC 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%202%20AC%20629" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 2 AC 629</a> and <b>Wu v Minister for
Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (No. 2) </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1994/1162.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] FCA 1162</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2051%20FCR%20232" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 51 FCR 232.</a>  Those cases
relate to public authorities and to decisions of great personal importance.
However where a substantial reason exists
there is no basis for the Court to
forbid a change in procedure.  
<P>

62	Mr Sutton contended that lack of procedural fairness was shown by the
alteration in the procedure which appeared to be adopted
on 29 march when he
was allowed to cross-examine Mr Higgins.  It is plain enough that the Executive
Committee decided after 29 March
1999 to put forward a change in the procedure
which the General Committee had adopted until then.  The change was in my view
reasonable
to adopt, as the events of 29 March demonstrated the impracticality
of continuing to proceed in any other way.  The plaintiff and
Mr Sutton did not
respond in any way to the opportunity offered to submit written statements and
submissions, and Mr Sutton's letter
of 12 April shows, not that the plaintiff
was suffering from any practical difficulty in doing so, but that the plaintiff
altogether
refused to do so; and it shows that the plaintiff made a requirement
for a procedure in which Mr Sutton cross-examined all other
persons furnishing
information before the plaintiff made any response.  This demand was not made
until the time by which submissions
were called for had passed, it was too
late, but if it had been made in due time, there could not have been any
reasonable expectation
that it would be granted.  
<P>

63	The procedure to be adopted is within the control of the General Committee,
and the plaintiff had no entitlement that any particular
procedural course
would be adopted.  If the plaintiff had been assured that some particular
procedural course would be adopted, the
plaintiff had no entitlement to be
exempt from any further decision modifying the procedure, or adopting a
different procedure. 
I have to consider whether the procedure, including the
procedure after the modification and the manner of modification, gave the
plaintiff a reasonable opportunity to bring forward for consideration material
which it wished to have considered.  After the experience
of 29 March, a
decision to abandon cross-examination was, on the grounds of sheer
practicality, well within the range of fair procedural
decisions which might be
adopted.  
<P>

64	The change in procedure might be unfair if it deprived the plaintiff in some
way of an opportunity of bringing forward what it
wished to have considered.
However there was no basis for thinking that it did so.  The plaintiff's
difficulties arise out of not
putting the information and submissions in
writing in any form, although invited to do so, and notwithstanding the obvious
impracticality
of a lengthy hearing before the General Committee at which all
adverse informants were to be cross-examined that was not in the world
of the
practical.  The General Committee included 28 persons and delegates from 11
clubs in 9 different cities and towns, and there
would be no real chance of
assembling the same 28 persons at each of a series of meetings.  The claim
which Mr Sutton eventually
brought forward on behalf of the plaintiff that all
adverse information should be the subject of cross-examination before the
plaintiff
made any statement was, it must be said, preposterous.  In any event
the claim was not advanced until about the time when a decision
was reached.
<P>

65	Mr Sutton contended that the alteration in the procedure deprived the
plaintiff of the opportunity to bring factual matter forward,
and had the
result that no evidence was led from the plaintiff at all.  However in
explaining this he adopted the position taken
in his letter of 12 April, that
there should be cross-examination of all prosecution witnesses before the
plaintiff determined what
evidence the plaintiff would lead in response.  This
demonstrates the vacuity of the contention that the change in procedure
deprived
the plaintiff of the opportunity to produce evidence; the plaintiff's
opportunity was defeated by its deliberate decision not to
bring material
forward at a time when it was appropriate to do so and when it was invited to
do so.  In effect it was contended that
the plaintiff was entitled to test
everything before the plaintiff said anything; and a claim like that could not
be justified.
<P>

66	In its broad outlines the controversy was not a new one and it had been
under consideration within the Group for some months
before March 1999.  In the
circumstances adopting a procedure which called for the plaintiff's position to
be stated, and moved to
consider the outcome in a relatively short time, was
not unjust.
<P>

67	Mr Sutton contended that practical difficulties relating to assembling a
General Committee to consider the charge could and should
have been dealt with
by appointing some disinterested outsider, and he instanced Sir Laurence
Street, to conduct the Inquiry.  In
the context of a voluntary association
conducting amateur sport I think it is enough to state the suggestion to
demonstrate that
the arrangement would not be suitable.  In any event there is
no reason why the General Committee should have entirely disqualified
itself
from consideration of the business.  The General Committee is the tribunal
which all members agreed would decide charges of
misconduct or other charges
within Clause 47.  
<P>

68	Mr Sutton contended to the effect that it was beyond the powers of the
Executive Committee to institute an Inquiry, and in support
of this he pointed
to Clause 31 and contended that its proviso disqualified any member of the
Executive from dealing with a contentious
question.  The short answer to this
is that the Executive did not resolve that the General Committee should
undertake the Inquiry.
 There is no Minute and the evidence seems to show that
there was no occasion when the General Committee formally resolved, following
the terms of Clause 47, to inquire into the matter of the complaint; but the
evidence including the Minute clearly shows that the
General Committee embarked
itself on doing so, and it must be understood that it decided to do so.  The
General Committee itself
inquired into the charge; their decision to do so is
not affected by the powers of the Executive Committee.
<P>

69	Mr Sutton contended that some persons who participated in the General
Committee as delegates were not or may not have been entitled
to attend as
delegates.  There was no evidence that any club delegates were not in fact
regularly appointed by their clubs.  The
plaintiff bore the onus of showing
that any of them were not actually delegates.
<P>

70	Mr Sutton also contended to the effect that when certain Committee members
whom he contended should be disqualified for earlier
participation or for the
expressed attitude of their clubs were excluded, the two-thirds majority
required by Clause 17 for a written
resolution had not been reached.  In my
view however no participant was disqualified in this way.  A related contention
was to the
effect that certain of the persons who voted as delegates on the
written resolutions were not identical with the delegates who were
present on
29 March and then took part in the Inquiry.  For the satisfaction of the
requirements of Clause 17 for a two-thirds majority
it is in my opinion enough
that the persons voting on the written resolution should at the time they voted
be delegates of a club,
and the plaintiff did not adduce evidence that the
persons who voted were not delegates at the time they voted.  To test the
procedural
fairness of the resolution it is not in my opinion required that the
two-thirds of the total membership of the committee, that is
nineteen persons,
both participated in the meeting of 29 March and voted in support of the
written resolution.  The requirement to
comply with Clause 17 and the
requirement that there should be procedural fairness are different requirements
and should not be confused;
there is in my opinion procedural fairness if
persons who were in attendance on 29 March formed a simple majority of the
persons
who actually voted for the written resolution; and it has not been
shown that they did not.
<P>

71	The effectual decision was made by the first written resolutions.  The
second written resolution expresses confirmation, but
it was not the occasion
of disposition of the complaint, and it is not to the point to test it for
procedural fairness.  No demonstration
of lack of procedural fairness of the
second written resolution was made, in my opinion.  
<P>

72	In calculating a two-thirds majority in relation to the first written
resolutions it seems clear that a two-thirds majority,
or nineteen persons did
not vote for a disqualification of one year; the conclusion that there was a
two-thirds majority for disqualification
of one year is reached by counting all
who voted for a longer disqualification, two years or three years, as
supporting a disqualification
of one year.  This was generous to the plaintiff
and was not an injustice.  The second written resolution had the effect, among
other
things, of confirming that it was the decision of the General Committee
to disqualify for one year.  
<P>

73	The disqualification imposed is clearly one of the penalties authorised by
the terms of Clause 48.  It was contended that evidence
which shows that in the
course of the past ten years no similar disqualification has been imposed is an
indication of bias or prejudgment.
 In my view that evidence has no such
implication
<P>

74	The context in which a disciplinary complaint is to be decided by a body
which is inherently unwieldy and inherently likely to
include persons with some
degree of knowledge or involvement includes Clause 49, which gives a general
right of appeal from a decision
of the General Committee to the Appeals Board
of CRL.  That is to say, there is ready access and a general appeal to an
Appeals Board
which is not part of the structure of the Group and does not have
involvement in Group affairs.  
<P>

75	The right of appeal to a tribunal which is not local and which would not be
affected by practical difficulties arising out of
the constitution of the
General Committee is the means available under the Group <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> to remedy
grievances arising from the unwieldy practicalities of the General Committee
and the closeness of its membership to any
controversy which it is likely to
decide .  On the evidence there is no reason to think that a hearing before the
Appeals Board would
not be conducted on a satisfactory basis.  The existence of
that right of appeal, and the plaintiff's apparently deliberate election
not to
exercise it are significant considerations adverse to intervention by the
Court.
<P>

76	Mr Sutton contended that it should be concluded that the decision to
disqualify was a nullity, and for that reason the plaintiff
was not obliged to
exercise its right of appeal and its not doing so should not be treated as an
adverse discretionary consideration.
 On my findings the decision was not a
nullity.  It is not clear that if the plaintiff succeeded it would be
established that the
disqualification was a nullity; it may be that it was
voidable but not void; but this does not need to be further explored.  If it
were correct that the disqualification were a nullity, the appeal remedy would
still be available, and the plaintiffs' not having
taken it would still be a
significant discretionary consideration.
<P>

77	In relation to the right of appeal Mr Sutton said to the effect that the
letter of charge of 19 March was drafted, as evidence
shows, by Mr Riordan, the
honorary solicitor of CRL, and that Mr Riordan has a part in the Appeals Board.
The Appeals Board is dealt
with by Clause 31 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> of CRL; the
honorary solicitor is not necessarily a member, although it seems quite
possible that Mr Riordan might be a member of
the Appeals Board.  An Appeal
Review Board, which considers questions of fresh evidence and includes the
honorary solicitor, participates
in some appeals.  On the evidence before me it
is not established that Mr Riordan would necessarily be a member of the Appeals
Board,
or that if he were he would necessarily be disqualified.  If there are
grounds on which Mr Riordan should be disqualified, the plaintiff
would have
been able to put them before the Appeals Board.  
<P>

78	Mr Sutton contended that there was a more general basis for concern about
the suitability of the Appeals Board and the part taken
by CRL in earlier
litigation and other aspects of the controversy.  However he showed no grounds
of substance why it would not be
reasonable to expect of the plaintiff that it
would exercise its right of appeal.  
<P>

79	Even if the plaintiff had shown that the disciplinary decision was invalid,
I would not make any of the declarations or the injunctions
sought, because of
the weight of the discretionary considerations adverse to intervention by the
Court.  The property interests which
would be protected are of nominal value
and very indirectly affected by the disqualification.  The strength of the view
of some clubs
that they do not wish to participate in a competition with the
plaintiff is clear.  As participation is voluntary, a disqualification
has been
imposed, a significant number of clubs do not want to play against the
plaintiff and the referees have refused to take part,
it is very unlikely that
any judicial order or injunction will bring about the result that the
competition will go on with the plaintiff
in it.  It is far more likely that
the competition will lapse, or will continue in the absence of a significant
number of clubs who
would otherwise participate.  The situation on the facts
has reached the limit of what a judicial order can achieve against a voluntary
association; it is not possible to compel people to continue to associate in
Group 19, and the risk is that the plaintiffs will be
left almost on their own,
with only one or two other first grade clubs.  The facts are an exemplification
of the wisdom of the policy
to which the High Court referred in <b>Cameron v
Hogan</b> of restraint in judicial interventions in the affairs of voluntary
associations.  The only likely outcome would be to break up Group
19.
<P>

80	For these reasons the proceedings will be dismissed with costs.  I will make
a representative order establishing that the eight
persons named as defendants
represent all members of the General Committee.
<P>

81	
<P>

Orders:
<P>

1.  Order that the defendants named in the Schedule to the Amended Summons be
appointed with effect from the time of commencement
of the proceedings to
represent all persons who were members of the General Committee of the New
England Group 19 Rugby League from
29 March 1999 until 13 April 1999 inclusive
of both dates.
<P>

	2.  The proceedings are dismissed with costs.
