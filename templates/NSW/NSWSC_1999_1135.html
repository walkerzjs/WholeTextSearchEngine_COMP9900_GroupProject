<P>

<i>(Plaintiff)</i>
<P>

<b>v</b>
<P>

<b>AMALGAMATED TELEVISION SERVICES PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>ACN 000 145 246</b>
<P>

<i>(Defendant)</i></center>
<P>

<b>Judgment (On admissibility of evidence - T2120.50 - reputation
evidence)</b>
<P>

1   	The following series of questions and answers were given by
Mr Lyall in examination-in-chief:
<P>

<i>"Q.	What impact did that have upon Mr Marsden's reputation, amongst members
of the legal profession?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It is very hard to say generally but I think it had an impacts </i>(sic)
<i>amongst the members of the profession.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	What was that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	They thought less of him".</i>
<P>

2   	The plaintiff, it being expressly disavowed that the
evidence was tendered on the basis of <b><i>Readers Digest Services Pty Limited
v Lamb </i></b>([1981-2] <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=150%20CLR%20500" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">150 CLR 500</a> at 507 per Brennan J), the question arises
as to its admissibility in accordance with established principles in relation
to reputation
evidence.
<P>

3   	For the defendant it was argued that the tendered testimony
falls within none of the categories of admissible evidence in relation
to the
plaintiff post-publication as dealt with by Hunt J in <b><i>Hughes v Mirror
Newspapers </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20NSWLR%20504" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 NSWLR 504</a> at 512-3.  
<P>

4   	It is clear from what Hunt J said at 513E-F that the
admissibility of evidence of the kind with which I am concerned is not
justifiable in relation to the plaintiff's reputation "<i>after</i>"
publication, if it goes only to the status of that reputation post-publication
as opposed to the particular circumstances of evidence
of third party
utterances about the plaintiff.
<P>

5   	By reason of the observations of Hunt J just referred to
and their applicability to the questions and answers set out above,
I am of the
view that the evidence is inadmissible and the evidence tendered will be struck
out.
