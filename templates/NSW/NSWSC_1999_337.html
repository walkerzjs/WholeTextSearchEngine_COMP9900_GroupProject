<P>

Defendant
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>14 April 1999</b>
<P>

1	This is an application by the Defendant as applicant for costs now to be
ordered which were reserved by Hodgson CJ in Eq, following
the unsuccessful
application by the Plaintiff for interim relief.
<P>

2	The circumstances are that the Plaintiff has subsequently commenced
proceedings in the Industrial Relations Commission on the
basis that wider
powers can be brought to bear by that commission than would be available were
the matter to proceed to a final hearing
in the Equity Division of this Court.
The Plaintiff is unable to say at this point whether or not all the issues
before the Equity
Division would have been brought before the Industrial
Commission though it does appear that other issues may also be dealt with
by
the Industrial Commission.
<P>

3	Essentially what the Plaintiff says is that the purpose of reserving costs
being ordinarily to enable the court that deals with
the matter on a final
basis to have regard to the matters then fully ventilated in deciding cost
orders, that it follows that the
proper order which I should now make is either
to leave the existing orders undisturbed or, to give leave for the matter to
come
back to this court after the disposal of the Industrial Commission
hearing.
<P>

4	The Defendant, as applicant before me, contends that the inescapable fact is
that the Plaintiff failed in his application for
interim relief and has
effectively abandoned the Equity proceedings for proceedings in the Industrial
Commission (though concededly
the only order made by consent to-day is a stay
of the Equity proceedings pending final determination of the IRC proceedings).
Given
that the IRC proceedings cannot be said necessarily to deal with the self
same matters in the self same way as this Court would deal
with the proceedings
if pursued on a final basis, it cannot be appropriate for this Court now to
continue to reserve costs from the
unsuccessful interim application. Rather the
normal rule of costs following the event should no longer be displaced nor
suspended,
especially where the "event" is the <i>failure</i> of an application
for interim relief, where the hurdles of proof are lower than on a final
hearing.
<P>

5	One way of testing the matter would be to ask what would likely have been
done had the Plaintiff announced prior to delivery of
judgment in the interim
proceedings that it would be commencing final proceedings in the IRC, such
that, at the least, any final
proceedings in the Equity Division would be
adjourned, though in reality effectively abandoned. In my view, the likely
outcome would
be that orders for costs would not have been reserved but would
have been made immediately, simply because one could not assume that
the IRC
proceedings would simply be a ventilation of the very same issues as would have
been before the Equity Division on an application
for final relief. While there
might have been a substantial overlap, that is by no means the same thing nor
can it be assumed. If
it were otherwise, why commence proceedings in the IRC
instead of proceeding in this Court?
<P>

6	Accordingly, I consider that the appropriate order now to be made is that the
Plaintiff should pay the Defendant's costs on the
interim application before
Hodgson CJ in Eq. and thus that order substituted.
<P>

7	It also follows that the costs of to-day's application being substantially in
relation to the earlier matter of costs is to be
paid by the Plaintiff.
