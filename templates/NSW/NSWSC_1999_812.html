SAUNDERS</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

<center><b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1   	HER HONOUR:  These proceedings were commenced by statement
of claim filed on 28 June 1990.  The nominated plaintiff, Leonard
Malcolm
Huntington, claimed damages for personal injuries allegedly sustained on or
about 5 May 1988 in a motor vehicle collision.
<P>

2   	The plaintiff was represented by solicitors.  It is not
clear what took place during the next four years or five years or so.
 However,
the present application is brought by the defendant who seeks an order that the
statement of claim be struck out for want
of prosecution.  The defendant relies
upon SCR Pt 33 r 6(2) which provides that:
<P>

"Where a plaintiff makes default in complying with any order or direction as to
the conduct of the proceedings, or does not prosecute
the proceedings with due
despatch, the court may, on application by any party or on its own motion, stay
or dismiss the proceedings."
<P>

3   	The defendant relies upon both limbs of the sub-rule, that
is failure to comply with an order or direction as to the conduct
of the
proceedings, and failure to prosecute the proceedings with due despatch.
<P>

4   	The defendant relies on two affidavits sworn by Craig
Douglas Blackmore, the first sworn on 29 July 1999 and the second on
4 August
1999.  In the first of those affidavits Mr Blackmore sets out a history of the
proceedings, commencing on 8 June 1995 when
the proceedings were listed for
directions before a Registrar.  The affidavit discloses a sorry history of
representation of the
plaintiff.  There are instances of the plaintiff's
representatives failing to appear, failing to notify the defendant's solicitors
of orders that had been made in the absence of the defendant and failing to
comply with orders and directions as to the conduct of
the proceedings.
<P>

5   	Although the plaintiff continued to be represented by the
same firm of solicitors, it appears that there were regular changes
of the
solicitor handling the matter.  During the course of the correspondence between
the solicitors, the defendant's solicitors
were advised, I think in about the
middle of 1998, that the plaintiff had died on 21 December 1997.   Subsequent
to that date, but
before being advised of the plaintiff's death, the
defendant's solicitors had arranged for medical examinations of the plaintiff
in Sydney.  I should add that the plaintiff was resident in Queensland at the
time.
<P>

6   	Thereafter a side issue arose as to the substitution of the
plaintiff's wife for the plaintiff.  The plaintiff's solicitors
sought the
consent of the defendant's solicitors for substitution of the plaintiff's wife
in her role as executrix of the estate.
 It subsequently became apparent that
although she was named as executor of the estate in the plaintiff's will,
probate had not been
sought, and although it was at some stage intended to seek
probate, eventually it was decided that no such application would be made.
That issue appears to have taken up some of the time of the solicitors during
1999 at least.
<P>

7   	In the second affidavit sworn by Mr Blackmore he deposes
that a report prepared by Mr R Stewart-Smith, who I was told during
the course
of the hearing is a traffic expert of some kind, had been served.  The report
was dated 2 June 1999 and was served on
23 July 1999.  Directions as to the
service of any such report had been made on 1 October 1998 and required service
by 30 October
1998.  The report was, therefore, many months outside the time
permitted by the directions.
<P>

8   	Mr Blackmore further deposed that he, as solicitor for the
defendant, had, after receipt of that report, attempted to locate
the defendant
but had been unsuccessful in doing so.  
<P>

9   	Also in evidence was a copy of the police report of
investigation into the collision which itself shows that it is likely that
there will be a very serious issue as to liability.  As far as I can see, the
competing contentions are that the plaintiff failed
to stop at a "Give Way"
sign, but he alleges that the defendant was driving without his headlights
illuminated.
<P>

10   	The inability of the defendant's insurer to locate the
defendant is, prima facie, a matter which would possibly cause considerable
prejudice to the defendant, should the matter proceed.  On the other hand, I
was told that the defendant's solicitors are in possession
of a statement made
by the defendant.  Another matter of relevance is that it is not clear to me
what issues arise as a result of
Mr Stewart-Smith's report, since that report
is not in evidence before me.
<P>

11   	On behalf of the plaintiff reliance was placed upon an
affidavit of Miss Margaret McCue and one of Mr Chidiac, each of whom
has been
the solicitor for the plaintiff at some stage.  These affidavits do not explain
in any way the inordinate delay that has
taken place in these proceedings.  One
is left to infer what may be the true explanation, but in the absence of clear
evidence, I
forebear to comment on the reasons for what is plainly a most
unsatisfactory state of affairs.
<P>

12   	There is undoubtedly presumptive prejudice to the
defendant in the circumstances disclosed.  The defendant has established
that
the plaintiff has defaulted on many occasions in compliance with orders and
directions of the court and has established that
the proceedings have not been
prosecuted with due despatch.  That does not automatically result in an order
to stay or dismiss the
proceedings.
<P>

13   	While I can perceive that prejudice might exist, and
indeed has been demonstrated, in relation to the inability to locate
the
defendant, that prejudice is, to some extent, ameliorated by the possession in
the defendant's insurers of his statement.
<P>

14   	Counsel for the plaintiff also relied upon a certificate
of partial compliance which purports to show that directions given
by the court
have been complied with.  What it demonstrates is that some documents, of which
service was required, have been served,
although invariably months later than
the date required by the directions, and that the final direction has not been
complied with
at all.
<P>

15   	In the end, it seems to me that I have to balance the
prejudice to the parties.  It was agreed between the parties that should
the
notice of motion be dismissed the defendant will consent to the substitution of
the plaintiff's widow as plaintiff, and the proceedings
can continue. It was
put to me that there is not a great deal that remains to be done in order to
prepare the matter for hearing.
<P>

16   	Were I to stay or dismiss these proceedings, the proposed
substitute plaintiff would be deprived of any right at all by reason
of the
passage of time, other than perhaps any right she may have against an
alternative defendant.
<P>

17   	An order under Pt 33 r 6(2) is discretionary, and as I say
may be made after a balancing of the demonstrated or presumed prejudice
to the
respective parties.  Despite my profound misgivings about the manner in which
the proceedings have been conducted on behalf
of the plaintiff to date, it
seems to me that in the end justice lies with refusing to make the order and
the giving of strict directions
for the future conduct of the matter.  I would
add that counsel for the plaintiff, very properly, conceded that the plaintiff
would
have to pay the defendant's costs of this application, and I propose to
make such an order.
<P>

18   	The orders I make are that the notice of motion is
dismissed.  The plaintiff is to pay the defendant's costs.  If there is
any
default in compliance with subsequent directions, even minor default, I give
the defendant leave to approach me directly for
the purpose of whatever
application the defendant might wish to make.
<P>

19   	By consent I order pursuant to Pt 8 r 1(b) of the SCR that
the applicant, Janice Huntington, be substituted as the plaintiff
in these
proceedings.  I will note that the order as to costs encompasses all orders
that are before me today.  I will dismiss the
plaintiff's notice of motion
dated 9 October 1998.
<P>

20   	The defendant has liberty, on two days notice to the
plaintiff, to list this matter before me at any time.
