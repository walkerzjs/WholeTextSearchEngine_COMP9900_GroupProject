<u>20239/99   -   Mactek Pty Limited  v  Tadiran Ltd &amp; Anor </u>
<P>

<u>JUDGMENT</u>
<P>

1	These proceedings were commenced by Statement of Claim filed on 28 July 1998.
There are two defendants.  Both are corporations
incorporated in the State of
Israel.  The process pleads an agreement for the supply of batteries.  It
alleges causes of action founded
both in contract and tort.
<P>

2	In August 1998, the plaintiff purported to effect service of process in
Israel.  It is conceded that copies of the Statement of
Claim were served on 25
August 1998.  No appearance has been filed on behalf of the defendants.
<P>

3	The second defendant had earlier commenced proceedings in Israel (Tel Aviv
Magistrates Court) against the plaintiff.  Those proceedings
were commenced by
Statement of Claim filed on 31 December 1997 and a claim was made for moneys
due for goods supplied pursuant to
an agency agreement (this being the same
agreement as is alleged in the Statement of Claim). This process was served on
20 January
1998.  On 22 March 1998, the plaintiff filed a Notice of Motion
seeking leave to defend those proceedings.  The hearing of the Notice
of Motion
has been listed for 4 May 1999.
<P>

4	Two Notices of Motion have been filed.  One was filed by the plaintiff on 22
January 1999.  It seeks, inter alia, leave to proceed
against the defendants.
The other was filed in Court on 23 February 1999 by the defendants.  It seeks,
inter alia, an order that
the Statement of Claim be set aside.  Both Notices of
Motion were listed for hearing on 19 March 1999.
<P>

5	The plaintiff relies on an affidavit sworn by Mr MacMahon (a director) and
affidavits sworn by Mr Killalea (its solicitor).  The
defendants rely on two
affidavits sworn by Mr Brand (their solicitor).  A part of this material was
the subject of objection and
rejected.
<P>

6	After the commencement of the hearing, by consent, it was decided to proceed
with the hearing of the defendants'  Notice of Motion
only.  As it was not in
dispute, service of the Statement of Claim was confirmed and the plaintiff's
Notice of Motion was stood over
generally (to abide the determination of the
defendants' application).
<P>

7	The defendants put their case in a number of ways.  There is a claim for
relief under the <i>Supreme Court Rules</i> for the setting aside of the
process on the basis that this Court is an inappropriate forum for the trial of
the proceedings.  There
is a claim for a stay on the basis that there has been
a submission to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts located in Tel Aviv
-
Yaffo.  There is a claim for a stay on the basis that the plaintiff should not
be permitted to litigate the same claim in different
jurisdictions.
<P>

8	The plaintiff's claim for relief under the <i>Rules </i>was not made within
the prescribed time.  Accordingly, this relief can only be granted if an
extension under Part 2 is first obtained.
<P>

9	The Court has a discretion to grant an extension of time.  It is exercised
having regard to the relevant circumstances of the
case and so that justice is
best served between the parties.  In this case, three principal matters were
agitated.  Firstly, the
merits of the claim for relief.  Secondly, the delay
and the explanation offered for delay.  Thirdly, there was the matter of
prejudice.
<P>

10	I shall first turn to the question of the merits of the claim for relief.

<P>

11	The proceedings brought in Israel are for the recovery of the price of goods
allegedly sold and delivered by the second defendant
to the plaintiff.  The
proceedings brought in this Court are for both breach of contract and tortious
inducement of breach of contract.
 
<P>

12	It is common ground that the agency agreement contained the following
exclusive jurisdiction clause:-
<P>

	"<u>Governing Law</u>:  This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by
the internal laws of the State of Israel and the courts located in Tel-Aviv
-
Yaffo shall have exclusive jurisdiction".
<P>

13	The case for the defendants places emphasis on this clause.  Reliance is
also placed on other circumstances (including an alleged
submission to the
Tel-Aviv Magistrates Court).
<P>

14	Counsel for the defendants has referred the Court to a number of authorities
(including <u>Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Co Inc v Fay</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/32.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 32</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20165%20CLR%20197" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 165 CLR
197</a>; <u>Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd &amp; Anor</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20171%20CLR%20538" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 171 CLR 538</a>
and <u>Akai Pty Ltd v The People's Insurance Co Ltd</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=141%20ALR%20374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">141 ALR 374).</a>
<P>

15	There was no issue as to the relevant principles.  The power of the Court to
grant relief is discretionary.  The Court will have
regard to the relevant
circumstances of the particular case before it.  The power is to be exercised
so that justice is best served
between the parties.  A defendant may be
entitled to a stay if, inter alia, he persuades the Local Court that it is a
clearly inappropriate
forum for the determination of the dispute.  The Court
will give effect to the contractual arrangements made between the parties
unless the circumstances of the case lead to a different conclusion.  There is
authority for the proposition that the discretion
should be exercised by the
granting of a stay unless strong cause for not doing so is shown by the
plaintiff.  There has to be an
available foreign tribunal to whose jurisdiction
the defendant is amenable.
<P>

16	The Court is confronted with a number of problems.  There is paucity and
lack of quality in the evidentiary material placed before
it.  	There are
questions touching upon the jurisdiction of a Master to grant some of the
relief that has been sought.  The power
to grant a stay in the circumstances of
this case involves an exercise of the inherent jurisdiction of the Court.  I
have voiced
my concerns on this question.  Neither side raises any question of
jurisdiction.  For present purposes, I shall proceed on the basis
of an
assumption of jurisdiction.  
<P>

17	The plaintiff has made application to the Tel Aviv Magistrates Court for
leave to defend the debt recovery action brought in
that Court.  Thereafter,
attempts were made to resolve the dispute.  The attempts proved to be
fruitless. The defendants have now
consented to the filing of Defences and
Cross-Claims in those proceedings.
<P>

18	Because of the state of the evidence, the legal effect of what has been done
in Israel is unclear.  Whilst it may be that there
has been a submission to
jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court to deal with the debt recovery claim, I
am not satisfied that there
has been any submission to jurisdiction in relation
to the causes of action propounded in these proceedings.  Further, the evidence
falls short of demonstrating that the applicable law ("the internal laws of the
State of Israel") provides similar remedies and that
the foreign Court has the
jurisdiction to entertain any such remedies.
<P>

19	Whilst the scope of the submission clause is intended to be wide, the
precise ambit of that width is far from clear.  Minds may
differ on that matter
and it was not fully argued.
<P>

20	Whilst it may be said that the submission clause embraces a claim for
damages founded upon repudiation of the agreement, I am
not satisfied that it
catches the claim in tort which is propounded in these proceedings.
<P>

21	The Court has been told that the plaintiff's claim is in the order of
$105,000 and that the defendants' claim is in the order
of about $65,000.
These are not claims of an order justifying the transportation of a number of
witnesses to a foreign country situated
quite some distance away.
<P>

22	The evidence is sparse.  It does appear that the goods were delivered to
Australia from Israel.  The Agency business was conducted
in this State.  There
are allegations of breach (both in contract and tort) relevant to this State.
It may be inferred that the proving
of questions of breach and quantum will
involve the calling of a number of witnesses and that many of them will be
residents of New
South Wales.
<P>

23	I am not satisfied that the defendants have demonstrated entitlement to any
of the relief sought.  I am not satisfied that this
Court is an inappropriate
forum in the relevant sense for the trial of the causes of action propounded in
these proceedings.  I am
not satisfied that the defendants are entitled to a
stay (be it on the basis of the submission clause or otherwise).  The
proceedings
in Israel are not the same as those brought in this Court.  The
stay application was not brought until some months after the effecting
of
service.
<P>

24	If it be necessary to so find, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has
discharged the requisite onus.
<P>

25	In the light of these findings, it is unnecessary to dwell on the question
of extension of time.  The claim for extension of
time is doomed to failure
because of the view taken as to the lack of merit in the application itself.
For completeness, it may be
added that, whilst any prejudice may be slight, the
delay is considerable (some months) and such explanation as is offered for the
delay falls short of being satisfactory.
<P>

26	I dismiss the Notice of Motion filed on 23 February 1999.  The defendants
are to pay the costs of the Notice of Motion.
