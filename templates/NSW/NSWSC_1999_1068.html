<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (On defendant's Notice of Motion seeking lists of plaintiff's
witnesses)</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR: The defendant moves by Notice of Motion filed
on 25 October 1999 for an order that the plaintiff provide to the
defendant by
4 pm on 29 October a list of the witnesses that he intends to call, in the
order in which he intends to call them, in
respect of the issues of
justification and qualified privilege raised.
<P>

2   	The basis upon which the order is sought is said to be
"<i>fairness"</i> made up of essentially two components:  first, the
elimination of surprise, and second, trial management.  Directions have been
given
hitherto in relation to the provision by the defendant to the plaintiff
of lists identifying its witnesses on the issues of justification
and qualified
privilege.  A direction has been given to the plaintiff to identify his
witnesses on the issue of damages. In respect
of each of those issues,
vis-a-vis the parties, each party respectively bears the onus.  There is
nothing remarkable within the conduct
of this case that the parties be called
upon to identify their witnesses on issues on which each bears the onus of
proof, that is
not only fair, but conforms with sensible trial management.
<P>

3   	Additionally, with respect to the defence of justification,
the defendant has provided proofs to the plaintiff.  It is not
necessary for me
to be informed with precision this morning as to the extent of the provision of
such proofs.  The effect of the
provision of such proofs <i>inter alia </i>has
been dealt with by the ruling I delivered at 10.30 this morning (DLJT 48:
NSWSC 1061).
<P>

4   	As to the defence of qualified privilege in respect of
which, of course, the defendant bears the onus, I repeat what I said
in the
course of submissions.  My acquaintance with the nature and extent of the
defendant's case on that defence is minimal by itself
and minimal compared to
the inevitable acquaintance I have gained of the defence case on justification.
On any real view of the matter,
the conduct of this case since 2 February 1999
has been concerned with the issue of justification.  I accept that in the
course of
arguing the leave to amend application, Mr Wheelhouse did refer to
aspects of the defence case on privilege.  My focus however has
been inevitably
on the structure of the defence case on justification.
<P>

5   	It is said, and I have no reason not to accept, that the
defendant has particularised at great length its case on privilege.
 It is said
that the defendant has answered up to a thousand or so interrogatories
consequent upon orders I made earlier this year
on that issue.  The provision
of the particulars and the answering of interrogatories conforms with rules of
practice and orders
made in connection with the defence of qualified privilege.
There is nothing remarkable about that I gather though the defendant
has a view
that the burden placed upon it has been unusual.
<P>

6   	I do not propose to make order 1 in the Notice of Motion as
sought today.  The orders hitherto made in relation to the delivery
of witness
lists conform with each party's onus of proof on the relevant issues and
obviously point to utility in terms of management
of the trial.
<P>

7   	I have been informed by Mr Marsden that in excess of 130
people have been interviewed by him, or by people on his behalf, in
respect of
the defence of justification.  That which the defendant seeks is a list of the
plaintiff's witnesses to be called in rebuttal.
 That is to be distinguished
from the onus of proof situation where it can fairly be anticipated that a
party who has to prove a
case on damages or a party who has to prove a case on
privilege or justification knows what its case is going to be.  A case in
rebuttal,
in the end, very much depends upon the case presented by the opposing
party.
<P>

8   	I am not persuaded of any unfairness to the defendant based
upon a proposition:  "<i>Well, we have had to disclose our witnesses on our
defences, it is only fair that the plaintiff disclose his witnesses in relation
to both of those defences in relation to his case in rebuttal</i>".
<P>

9   	As at 26 October 1999 I am not persuaded that there is any
unfairness merely by reason of the regime presently in place.  It
has not, as
it cannot be, been submitted that the conduct of the defence case on
justification or qualified privilege is compromised
by the defence being
ignorant of the plaintiff's witnesses that <i>may</i> be called in rebuttal; in
respect of each defence the defendant bears the onus.  As a trial management
proposition the management
of the trial, or that component of it constituted by
the defendant presenting its case on justification and privilege, cannot be
compromised or prejudiced by the absence of a list of witnesses in rebuttal
from the plaintiff.
<P>

10   	Reliance was placed by the defendant on what is said to
have been a concession made by Mr Reynolds SC for the plaintiff as
recorded on
page 28 of the transcript of 3 February 1999 and the use by Mr Reynolds of the
expression "<i>it cuts both ways</i>".  That was in the context of an
application then made in relation to the identity of witnesses that they be
dealt with in blocks.
 The situation as it existed on what was, in effect, the
second or third day of the week set aside for pretrial directions before
the
commencement of the trial in February 1999 really cannot be said to apply
now.
<P>

11   	One context, as I understand it, was in anticipation of a
perceived requirement under the Jury Act for witnesses to be identified
before
the jury was empanelled.  That however was not the exclusive context.  That at
some time the defendant, both as a matter of
fairness and in the interests of
efficient trial management, may well have to  be informed of the list of
anticipated witnesses for
the plaintiff must be acknowledged as, indeed, as I
understand it, Mr Marsden does acknowledge.  When that time will be, I do not
now propose either to indicate or to rule.  All I am now ruling is that I have
not been persuaded that there is any basis for making
the order sought in
paragraph 1 of the Notice of Motion and I decline to do so.
