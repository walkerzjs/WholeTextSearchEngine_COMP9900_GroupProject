<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>

1   	It is well settled that if an applicant for an injunction
fails to disclose to the Court all relevant facts which the duty
of candour to
the Court requires to be disclosed, and in a way which is not misleading, the
Court has a discretion to discharge the
injunction.  The Court may in some
cases exercise its discretion by maintaining the injunction, though penalising
the applicant by
an appropriate order as to costs or by calling upon the
Plaintiffs' undertaking as to damages.  See for example, <i>Holden v
Waterlow</i> (1866) 15 WAR 139 and <i>Thomas A Edison v Bullock</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1912/72.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1912] HCA 72</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281912%29%2015%20CLR%20679" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1912) 15
CLR 679</a> at 682 and the discussion in Spry "The Principles of Equitable
Remedies" LBC 1997 at 494-500.  While that duty of candour applies
with
especial stringency to ex parte applications (see for example <i>Frigo v
Culhaci</i> (Court of Appeal, 17 July 1998, unreported), its scope extends to
any application, contested or not, where evidence is presented
to the court in
support of an application.  Those duties apply to the parties.  
<P>

2   	But their legal advisers -- not at fault here -- have also
by virtue of their duties to the court, a personal duty to the court,
overriding their duty to the client, to disclose the law and not mislead as to
the facts;  see D A Ipp "Lawyers Duties to the Court"
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20114%20Law%20Quarterly%20Review%2063" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 114 LQR 63</a> at 67.
A legal adviser depends on the instructions given.  Nonetheless the legal
adviser should remain alert to the importance of
ensuring he or she <i>can</i>
fulfil the personal duty of candour he or she owes to the Court.  If in doubt
about the veracity of the instructions or their potential
to mislead the Court,
the legal advisers should press the client until properly satisfied that such
potential is removed and in the
meantime must decline to put submissions to the
Court while in doubt about their potential to mislead.  The point may be
reached,
where the lawyer ceases to act.  Whether and how far legal
professional privilege would then preclude disclosure to the Court, perhaps
in
very general terms, of the reason for ceasing to act, is a question for the
future.  Absence of that minimal disclosure leaves
the Court at risk of being
misled by the recalcitrant party and its new and potentially uninformed legal
advisers.  I adopt in that
regard what has been said by G E Dal Pont in
"Lawyers' Professional Responsibility" (LBC, 1996) at 354-5:
<P>

"<b>(d)	Verification of client's narrative</b>
<P>

Lawyers must bring a proper degree of caution, even mild scepticism, to their
client's narrative of events.  In other words, they
must take reasonable steps
to verify the client's contentions, especially where the client is making
serious allegations against
another person.  For example, in <i>Y v M</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%203%20NZLR%20581" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 3 NZLR 581</a> at 590,  Temm J found that of one of the causes of a
misleading affidavit in a custody and access dispute (which included
allegations
of child sexual abuse) was `the unquestioning acceptance by the
partner in the firm as to what the mother had to say'.
<P>

<b>(c)	Evidentiary foundation to support statements and allegations</b>
<P>

Related to the duty to ascertain the verity of the client's statements, lawyers
must not be a party to the presentation to the court
of any evidence, or the
making of any statement or allegation, for which there is, in their opinion,
insufficient evidentiary foundation.
 For instance, the Australian Bar
Association's <i>Code of Conduct</i> (1993) ABA, Code of Conduct (1993), r5.8,
provides that `[i]n opening any proceedings, a barrister shall not open any
alleged facts
as a fact where he or she does not believe that the alleged fact
will be supported by evidence to be presented'."
<P>

3   	The underlying principles are expressed in the maxim that
he who seeks equity must do equity.  There is an immediate and necessary
relation between the equity which must be done and the equity sued for;
Scrutton LJ in <i>Moody v Cox</i> [1917] 2 CH at 87-8.
<P>

4   	The situation presently before me is the converse of the
conventional case of a party seeking an injunction;  I am dealing
with the duty
of candour of the defendant who seeks to resist an injunction or as here, have
the court impose conditions on its grant.
 The question is whether the same
principles apply with analogous results, where it is shown that the Defendant
has misled the Court,
wittingly or not.  
<P>

5   	I am satisfied in that converse case, the Court's
discretion is likewise enlivened.  It may be exercised to vary the conditions
sought by the Defendant and/or to impose appropriate cost orders upon the
Defendant.  What enlivens the discretion, is that the Defendant
has misled the
Court in the way the Defendant has presented its case against the Plaintiff's
relief and in particular as to the conditions
which should attach to it.  (I
say this, noting there is no suggestion that the Defendant's legal advisers
were aware that their
instructions were such as would mislead the Court.)  This
is as a mark of the Court's concern at the Defendant's failure in that
duty,
deliberate or not, careless or not, innocent or not, and to compensate the
other party to the extent extra costs are thereby
incurred.  Naturally, if the
Court is made aware of the basis for that failure and in particular whether it
was inadvertent, that
is a factor which may potentially affect the
appropriateness and terms of a cost order.  But so far as the other party is
concerned,
if a further hearing is necessitated by that non-disclosure,
inadvertent or not, that innocent party should ordinarily be compensated
for
any extra cost, whatever the outcome of that further hearing..
<P>

<b>THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES</b>
<P>

6   	The Plaintiffs successfully obtained relief, though on
conditions, against eviction by the Defendant from two leased properties
in
Darling Harbour, in a judgment and orders of Young J on 27 July 1999.  Material
to the conditions attaching to that relief was
the question of what would have
been a fair market rent at the time for the two leased premises.  This was in
order to arrive at
a basis for establishing the rent that should, in all the
circumstances, be paid by the Plaintiffs thereafter.  This would be until
a
final determination is made in relation to the issues between the parties,
anticipated in some six months.  
<P>

7   	On 6 August 1999 the solicitors for the Plaintiffs drew the
Defendant's solicitor's attention to evidence which must have misled
Young J in
determining the fair rental for one of the two premises;  that indeed has been
properly conceded by counsel for the Defendant
to-day.  That evidence related
to a valuer's estimate of fair market rent for supposedly comparable premises,
based on instructions
from the Defendant as to those market rentals.  The
letter of 6 August 1999 at para 16 and following sets out several instances
where
rent concessions of various kinds had not been disclosed to the valuer by
the Defendant and which concededly, if taken into account,
would have led to
those supposedly comparable rents being reduced.  That is not to say that in an
ultimate trial of that issue the
fair market rent would necessarily differ from
that found by Young J, though it might.  What is undeniable is that further
evidence
at a fresh hearing will now have to be considered in order to
determine afresh that very matter as affecting the Plaintiffs' conditions
for
relief.  So extra costs will be incurred, quite unnecessarily and taking up
scarce court time.
<P>

8   	The Defendant was invited to give any further explanation
for how the misleading evidence came to be given insofar as it may
bear upon
whether the valuer was erroneously instructed through the Defendant's innocent
mistake, careless mistake or deliberately.
 The Defendant declined to take up
that opportunity.  Rather it sought that the matter await the determination of
what has been described
as a "final" interlocutory hearing by Hodgson CJ in Eq
on 10 September 1999.  That further hearing would not have been necessary,
but
for the Defendant's failure.  At that hearing, the matter of the interim
arrangements would be dealt with and in particular the
appropriate rent
determined as would be paid until a final hearing in six months.  I declined to
defer consideration of the Defendant's
application pending the outcome of the
hearing of 10 September 1999. I did not consider that the outcome before
Hodgson CJ in Eq,
even if identical with that reached by Young J in terms of an
interim rental arrangement, should affect the application of the principles
to
which I have earlier referred.  The simple and inescapable fact is that a
further hearing has been necessitated solely because
the Defendant, for
whatever reason, misled the Court.  Moreover it has declined to put before the
Court any further explanation than
that, leaving the inference inescapable that
such further explanation would not have assisted the Defendant's case;
<i>Jones v Dunkel</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1959/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1959] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281958%2d9%29%20101%20CLR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1958-9) 101 CLR 298.</a>  
<P>

9   	The Defendant/lessor has consented to interim rental
arrangements which accord with those originally sought by the Plaintiff
before
Young J rather than the higher level he determined, based on the misleading
evidence then before him.  That is hardly a concession,
since this lasts only
until the hearing date some three weeks hence on 10 September 1999, when a new
interim regime can be laid down.
 It follows that the Defendant will not be
significantly disadvantaged, given the shortness of the interval till then. 
<P>

10   	This would therefore constitute no real penalty for the
Defendant in misleading the Court and, by its actions, necessitating
a further
hearing.  That the evidence in relation to one of the two tenancies is not
claimed to be misleading hardly matters in such
a context.  The Plaintiffs must
now face a further hearing of the very matter which should have been resolved
before Young J, as
well as the earlier hearing before me.  The Court has
therefore by cost orders to signify the importance it places on the proper
performance of the duty to the Court of complete candour.  This principle is
conveniently stated in the Canadian case of  <i>Pulse Microsystems Limited
&amp; Ors v Safesoft Systems Inc &amp; Another</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2036%20IPR%20331" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 36 IPR 331</a> at 342:
<P>

"An award of solicitor-and-client costs in this court and in the Court of
Queen's Bench, however, will serve to compensate the defendants
for the costs
they have incurred in defending their rights in the interlocutory proceedings.
At the same time, it will serve as a
penalty to the plaintiffs for their
failure to make full and frank disclosure to the court on their application for
Anton Piller
relief, and as a reminder to other plaintiffs of the complete
candour which must accompany such an application.  As well, the defendants
will
have judgment against the plaintiffs for the value of their hard drive, namely,
$600."
<P>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>

11   	In referring to the failure of the Defendant's duty, I
wish to make emphatically clear that no assertion was made that the
fault lay
with either counsel or instructing solicitors for the Defendant;  indeed the
Plaintiffs' counsel was at pains to say otherwise.
 However, that does not
alter the position so far as the appropriate order that should be made in the
circumstances.  This is because
the duty of candour is firstly a duty of the
party involved, though reinforced by the legal adviser's corresponding duty to
the Court.

<P>

<b>ORDER</b>
<P>

12   	That the Defendant pay on an indemnity basis the
Plaintiffs' costs of and incidental to to-day (18 August 1999) and the
Plaintiffs'
costs of 27 July 1999.
