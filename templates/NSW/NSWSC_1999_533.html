<b>4081/1995 - KENNA &amp; BROWN PTY LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) &amp; DANIEL IVAN
CVITANOVIC v LANCE ERIC KENNA, PATRICIA ELLEN KENNA &amp;
ERNEST BROWN</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1	The plaintiffs in this matter are Kenna &amp; Brown Pty Ltd (In Liquidation)
(the Company) and the liquidator of the Company,
Daniel Ivan Cvitanovic (the
Liquidator) who was appointed on 29 June 1995.  The Company was incorporated in
1980 and, as trustee
for the Kenna &amp; Brown Trust pursuant to deeds dated 30
April 1980 and 10 June 1983 (the Trust Deeds), conducted the business
of
building and construction and property development in the Wollongong and
surrounding areas. 
<P>

2	The first defendant Lance Eric Kenna (Mr Kenna),who is now a bankrupt, was a
director of the Company between 30 April 1980 and
29 June 1995.
<P>

3	The second defendant Patricia Ellen Kenna, (Mrs Kenna) was employed by the
Company between 1982 and 29 June 1995.
<P>

4	The third defendant, Ernest Brown, (Mr Brown) was a director of the Company
between 30 April 1980 and 29 June 1995.
<P>

5	Mr Kenna and Mr Brown first met in 1964 and commenced a business partnership
that year in which they sub-contracted carpentry
services to builders and home
owners (the partnership).
<P>

6	In 1976 the partnership moved into property development which included the
purchase of residential blocks of land for the construction
and sale of houses
and blocks of units.
<P>

7	From approximately 1973  Mr Graeme Brangwin of KPMG Peat Marwick was retained
as the accountant for the partnership and then later
for the Company.
<P>

8	The Company's registered office was at 26 Ocean Street Thirroul (the Thirroul
property).  These premises were for some years both
the home of Mr and Mrs
Kenna and the office from which the Company operated. Mr Brown did not have any
interest in the Thirroul property
nor did he have or occupy any office space
within the Thirroul property.
<P>

9	Mr Kenna was the sole registered proprietor of the Thirroul property from 1
January 1989 to 18 June 1993.  Mr and Mrs Kenna have
been registered
proprietors of the Thirroul property since 18 June1993.  Another property owned
by Mr and Mrs Kenna is Lot 7, 40
Sullivans Road Douglas Park (the Douglas Park
property).  Mr Kenna was the sole registered proprietor of this property from 1
January
1989 to 18 June 1993 when Mrs Kenna was also registered as
proprietor.
<P>

10	In 1980 when the partnership was incorporated Mr Brangwin explained the
role, responsibility and obligations of directors to
Messrs Kenna and Brown.
The division of duties in the Company was that generally Mr Brown <i>was out on
the jobs building things</i> and Mr Kenna <i>was back in the office running the
business side of things.</i>
<P>

11	Mr Brown did the carpentry and rectification work and supervised the
building works and tradesmen on site.  Mr Kenna visited
the building sites
daily at which time the two men would discuss the progress of the work.  
<P>

12	Mr Brown left the management of the office to Mr &amp; Mrs Kenna. He
attended the Thirroul property office weekly to collect
his wages.  He would
also attend the office from time to time to check building plans and
specifications, to pick up materials required
at the site and to sign any
documents which Mr Kenna had prepared for him for signature.  
<P>

13	By 1994 the Company had expanded its activities and was undertaking more
work than it had the previous year.  During the latter
half of 1994 and into
1995 the Company expanded its activities even further.  It commenced three new
large projects and employed
two additional site supervisors.  
<P>

14	In March 1995 Mr Kenna approached the Company's banker  to renegotiate the
Company's facilities in particular to apply for an
extension of the Company's
overdraft. The bank declined the application and on 2 June 1995 an
administrator was appointed to the
Company.  Mr Kenna issued the following
letter on Company letterhead that day.
<P>

	<i>This letter causes me great disappointment.  I must inform you that as of
today, 2 June 1995, Kenna and Brown Pty Ltd is closing down
and stopping all
work on current projects.  </i>
<P>

	<i>We have experienced financial hardship during the last six months, due we
feel to the volume of work we have, causing a cash flow
crisis, which we feel
we cannot overcome.</i>
<P>

	<i>An administrator has now been appointed and will be in touch with you on
Monday 5 June.  </i>
<P>

15	The liquidator was appointed on 29 June 1995.
<P>

16	The plaintiffs subsequently commenced these proceedings.  Mr J Thomson of
counsel appeared for the plaintiffs.  Mr C Newlinds
appeared for Mrs Kenna and
Mr D Robinson and Mr J Conomy appeared for Mr Brown.  Ms Nash (solicitor)
appeared on the first day of
the hearing for the official trustee in bankruptcy
of the estate of Mr Kenna. On 7 April 1999 Tamberlin J granted leave pursuant
to <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s58.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 58(3)</a> </i>of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act 1966</a> </i>to continue these
proceedings against Mr Kenna.
<P>

17	The matter was heard on 6,7,8 &amp; 9 April 1999 when it was stood over to
allow Mr Thomson to file further written submissions
and to consider whether an
application to re-open should be made in the light of the third defendant's
submissions in relation to
<i>s1318 of the Corporations Law</i>. The plaintiffs
filed further written submissions on 21 April 1999 and on 27 April 1999 advised
there would be no application to
re-open. The third defendant's written
submissions in response to the plaintiffs' submissions were filed on 5 May
1999.
<P>

	<b>Claim against the First Defendant Mr Kenna</b>
<P>

18	The plaintiffs claim that Mr Kenna;
<P>

	18.1.	misapplied the assets of the Company in the amounts of $131,390.18 for
payment for work done and materials supplied to the
Douglas Park Property
between 1 January 1994 and 29 June 1995 and $40,500 for work done and materials
supplied to the Thirroul property.
(<i>paragraphs 13 &amp; 14);</i>
<P>

	18.2.	breached his duty to the Company to ensure that proper records of the
Company's financial dealings were maintained by:-
<P>

	(a)	directing Mrs Kenna not to record cash received from customers of the
Company in the Company's financial records;
<P>

	(b)	directing and/or acting with Mrs Kenna in the falsification of cheque
butts to record payments to the Water Board knowing that
the cheque had been
made out to cash;
<P>

	(c)	failing to bring to the Company's external accountants' attention;
<P>

	(i)	 the fact that they had not been given records of cash received by the
Company nor any records that showed the cash had been
given to Mr Kenna; and
<P>

	(ii)	 the fact that cheque butts recording payments to the Water Board were
false entries and that the cheques were in fact made
out to cash.
(<i>paragraphs 13A and</i> 5)
<P>

	18.3	breached his duty to the Company by taking cash received by the Company
and failing to account to the Company for that cash.
<i>(paragraphs 16 and
5)</i>
<P>

19	It is alleged that by reason of the matters set out in paragraph 18 above Mr
Kenna received the benefit of the cash and the misapplied
funds without which
he would not have been able to acquire, repay loans on and improve the Douglas
Park property.
<P>

20	It is claimed that in the circumstances he is liable to account to the
Company. It is further claimed that the Company is entitled
to;
<P>

<i>&#183;	</i>  trace the misapplied funds into the Douglas Park property; 
<P>

<i>&#183;	</i> an order declaring that Mr &amp; Mrs Kenna hold the Douglas Park
property upon a constructive trust; and/or
<P>

<i>&#183;	</i> an order charging the Douglas Park property with the obligations
of Mr &amp; Mrs Kenna to account.
<P>

(<i>paragraphs 13B and 13C)</i>
<P>

21	It is also alleged that Mr Kenna failed to exercise the degree of care and
diligence that a reasonable person in like position
in a corporation would
exercise.  A further circumstance relied upon in this regard is his purported
approval at a meeting recorded
as having taken place on 16 December 1994 that
the financial statements of the Company as at 30 June 1994;
<P>

<i>	</i>(a)	gave a true and fair view of the Company's position;
<P>

<i>	</i>and
<P>

<i>	</i>(b)	that the Company kept such accounting records as correctly recorded
and explained transactions and financial positions of the
Company;
<P>

<i>	</i>when he knew this was not the position. <i>(paragraph 17)</i>
<P>

22	It is also alleged Mr Kenna failed to take all reasonable steps to comply
with or secure compliance with or was the cause of
the default in the Company
complying with <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/index.html#p3.6" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3.6</a> of the Corporations Law</i> <i>(paragraph
18).</i>
<P>

23	It is alleged that the Company was insolvent at all times between 1 April
1995 and 2 June 1995 . It is claimed that the Company
contravened
<i>s289(1) &amp; (2) of the Corporations Law</i> during that period and is
thereby deemed to be insolvent pursuant to <i>s588E (4) of the Corporations
Law.</i>
<P>

24	It is alleged alternatively that during that period the Company incurred
debts exceeding $1,280,923 of which $1,280,923 was not
paid as at the date of
liquidation. As at the date of liquidation, 29 June 1995, it is alleged that
that Company had debts of $2,747,391
of which $1,466,468 was owed by the
Company to creditors as at 1 April 1995 and has never been paid to those
creditors. <i>(paragraphs 22 to 25)</i>
<P>

25	It is alleged that Mr Kenna was aware at the times when the Company incurred
these debts that there were grounds for suspecting
that the Company was then
insolvent at the time each such debt was incurred <i>(paragraph 26).
</i>Alternatively it is alleged that a reasonable person in a like position
would have been so aware. <i>(paragraph 27)</i>
<P>

26	The plaintiffs claim that Mr Kenna contravened<i> s588G of the Corporations
Law</i> and an order pursuant to <i>s 588M</i> that he pay $1,286.923.40 to the
Company. <i>(paragraph 30)</i>
<P>

	<b>Claim against the second defendant, Mrs Kenna</b>
<P>

27	It is alleged that Mrs Kenna was employed by the Company between 1982 and 29
June 1995 as the internal accountant with duties
which included the preparation
and/or supervision of the preparation of the Company's books and records. It is
further alleged that
the nature of Mrs Kenna's duties were such that she was an
executive officer within the meaning of the Corporations Law. <i>(paragraphs 3
&amp; 4)</i>
<P>

28	It is claimed that by reason of her position as internal accountant and the
nature of her duties Mrs Kenna owed a fiduciary duty
to the Company to;
<P>

	(a)	ensure that proper records of all the Company's financial dealings were
maintained;
<P>

	(b)	ensure that no cheque was drawn on the Company's bank account except for a
purpose of the Company;
<P>

	(c)	inform the Company if any of its monies had been or might in the future be
misapplied;
<P>

	(d)	disclose to the Company any misconduct of any director of the Company;
<P>

	(e)	disclose to the Company's external accountant all records and information
necessary to enable the formation of a true view
of the affairs of the Company.
<i>(paragraph 4)</i>
<P>

29	It is alleged that Mrs Kenna breached her fiduciary duty to the Company in
that;
<P>

&#183;	  she did not take steps to ensure that proper records of all of the
Company's financial dealings were maintained;
<P>

&#183;	  she made false entries in the Company's records; and 
<P>

&#183;	  she failed to inform the Company or the external accountants of these
matters and the misapplication of the Company's monies
to the benefit of
herself and Mr Kenna in relation to the payments made for the Douglas Park
property and the payments to Mr Kenna
of the cash received by the Company.
<i>(paragraphs 5 to 9 and 11 to 13A)</i>.
<P>

30	Additionally the plaintiffs claim that Mrs Kenna has breached her duty to
the Company by gaining an advantage for herself by
the use of the funds for the
improvement of the Douglas Park and Thirroul properties and through the benefit
of the cash payments.
The plaintiffs claim Mrs Kenna is liable to account to
the Company for those amounts.<i>(pars 13 &amp;14)</i>
<P>

	<b>Claim against the third defendant, Mr Brown</b>
<P>

31	It is alleged that Mr Brown failed to institute checks and controls or seek
advice as to such checks and controls that would
have protected the Company
against the misconduct of Mr &amp; Mrs Kenna. It is also alleged that such
conduct was a failure to exercise
the degree of care and diligence that a
reasonable person in a like position in a corporation would exercise in the
Company's circumstances.
<i>(paragraph 17)</i>
<P>

32	There is a similar claim made against Mr Brown as is made against Mr Kenna
in respect of the insolvency of the Company with a
claim  made for orders that
Mr Brown has contravened <i>s588G of the Corporations Law</i> and<i>
s588M(2)</i> and that he pay $1,286,923 to the Company.
<P>

	<b>The Company as Trustee</b>
<P>

33	The Trust Deeds required any determination or resolution of the Company as
Trustee to be recorded in a written minute and signed
by the directors of the
Company. In the event that income was insufficient to meet the Trust's
obligations the Company as Trustee
was authorised to borrow funds and mortgage
or charge the whole or part of the future income of the trust.
<P>

34	Additionally the Trust Deeds imposed an obligation on the Company as Trustee
to keep accurate accounts of its trusteeship with
a discretion to have those
accounts audited annually.
<P>

35	There was no express authority in the Trust Deeds authorising the directors
or employees of the Company as Trustee to take cash
or benefit from other
monies of the Trust. There was no minute recording the provision of such cash
or other benefits to the directors
or employees. No specific point has been
raised by the defendants in respect of the Company acting as Trustee and Mr
Thomson submits
that it does not assist the defendants in this case.
<P>

36	Mr Thomson has referred me to <i>Octavo Investments Pty Ltd v Knight <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1979/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1979] HCA 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%20144%20CLR%20360" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979)
144 CLR 360</a> at 367 </i>in support of the principle that the trustee is
personally liable for its acts and omissions as trustee. Additionally he
submits that
the fact that the trust funds were being managed by the Company
may be relevant to the nature of the duties owed by the defendants
to the
Company with which I will deal in due course. Otherwise there is no need to
deal further with this topic and the reference
to the Company throughout this
judgment should be taken to include a reference to the Company as Trustee.
<P>

	<b>Presumption of Insolvency</b>
<P>

37	The plaintiffs rely on<i> s588E(4) of the Corporations Law</i> to establish
the insolvency of the company by its alleged breach of <i>s289 of the
Corporations Law</i> because of:
<P>

	1.	the failure of the company to:
<P>

	(a)	 keep accounting records that correctly recorded and explained its
transactions (including any transaction as trustee) and
financial position
during the relevant period;  and/or
<P>

	(b)	keep such account records in the manner prescribed by s 289(1)(b) of the
Corporations Law;  and/or
<P>

	2	the failure of the company to obtain such accounting records for the period
required by s 289(2).
<P>

38	Accounting records include the documents of prime entry as defined and "such
working papers and other documents as are necessary
to explain the methods and
calculations by which accounts are made up" <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 9).</a></i>
<P>

39	<i>Section 289</i> imposed on the company an obligation to:
<P>

	(a)	to keep such accounting records as correctly record and explain its
transactions and financial position;  and
<P>

	(b)	so keep its accounting records that:
<P>

	(i)	true and fair accounts of a company could be prepared from time to time;
and
<P>

	(ii)	the company's accounts could be conveniently and properly audited or
reviewed in accordance with the Corporations Law.
<P>

40	In respect of the breach of <i>s289</i> the plaintiffs rely on the evidence
of Mrs Kenna in the public examination pursuant to <i>s596A of the
Corporations</i> <i>Law</i> which occurred on 5 and 6 October 1995. 
<P>

41	The transcript of that evidence was tendered pursuant to <i>s597(14)</i>
which provides relevantly that any transcript of an examination may be used in
evidence in any legal proceedings against that person.
<P>

42	Objection was initially taken by Mr Newlinds to the tender of this
transcript in the absence of specific parts of the transcript
being identified.
Those specific parts were subsequently identified.  No objection was taken as
to the authentication of the transcript
and it was admitted as exhibit C.  It
was not tendered against Mr Brown however Mr Brown's transcript was tendered by
the plaintiffs
in their case against him.
<P>

43	The case against Mrs Kenna includes a claim that as a result of her conduct
the Company suffered loss and damage.  Mrs Kenna's
evidence in exhibit C can be
relied upon by the plaintiff in respect of the insolvency question.
<P>

44	Mrs Kenna's evidence included the following:
<P>

44.1  The Douglas Park property was purchased in approximately 1989 and during
1994 and 1995 a five bedroom home with guest quarters
was constructed at the
property.  The construction of this home at Douglas Park was carried out in
part by subcontractors of the
company.  During 1994 certain payments were made
by the company for the construction costs of the home at the Douglas Park
property.
<P>

44.2  Mrs Kenna kept what she described as a <i>little journal</i> in respect
of the payments relating to the Douglas Park property which she said told her
<i>what was paid, who to, by whom, how much, what dates</i>.  Mrs Kenna also
claimed there was a file containing every invoice that was paid in respect of
the Douglas Park property.
<P>

44.3  Payments made by the Company recorded in the <i>little journal </i>to
which Mrs Kenna referred were not recorded in the records of the company which
were provided to the accountant Mr Brangwin.
<P>

44.4  Some cheques of the Company were written to cash but those cheque butts
were recorded as payments to the Water Board.  The
accountant was not informed
that these cheque butts contained false entries nor was he informed that the
cheques were in fact paid
to cash.
<P>

44.5  Mrs Kenna claimed that she kept two separate cash receipt books.  In a<i>
little red cash receipt book</i> she recorded cash that was received by the
Company but was paid directly to Mr Kenna.  This book was not given to the
accountants.
 When the Company's accounts were prepared by the accountant they
did not record any of the cash that had been received nor was the
accountant
informed of the receipt of such cash.  It is also apparent that no cash was
banked through the company's account from
July 1992.
<P>

44.6  On some occasions when the Company paid invoices and/or wages for work
done on the Douglas Park property the payments were
recorded in the Company's
records as a payment in relation to a different property altogether. For
instance rather than recording
the payment in respect of the Douglas Park
property it was recorded as Francisco Crescent Rosemeadow. 
<P>

44.7  Although Mrs Kenna claimed she kept:
<P>

	(i)	a file relating to the Douglas Park property of invoices paid;
<P>

	(ii)	a little journal recording payments by the Company in respect of the
Douglas Park property;
<P>

	(iii)	a little red book recording receipts of cash which that were paid to the
Company and given to Mr Kenna
<P>

they had all "disappeared".  Mrs Kenna claimed there was a break in at the
Thirroul property in May/June 1995 when although other
things were not stolen
these records disappeared.
<P>

45	Additionally or alternatively the plaintiffs also rely on the liquidator's
evidence to prove this aspect of the case. Mr Euan
Poulton claimed that he paid
$6,000 cash to the company on 13 May 1995 and that there was no record of the
receipt of this amount
either on the deposit slips or in the bank statements of
the Company.  Nor was there any record in the debtor's card for the particular
job to which the payment related (182 Foothills Road Corrimal).  The liquidator
could not find any manual cash book for the relevant
period
<P>

46	He said that the records of the Company referred to<i> cash payments to
trade creditors </i>of the Company when in fact they were payments to suppliers
of goods and/or services towards the construction of the home at the Douglas
Park property. 
<P>

47	The liquidator also produced a series of documents in exhibit B which
demonstrate that the records of the Company were inaccurate
and did not reflect
the transactions that occurred in respect of the supply of goods and services
to the Thirroul property in particular
the supply of such services by Coastal
Stairs and Tile Distributors.  It is apparent from this documentation that
although the supply
was to the Thirroul property the Company's records, in
particular the purchase journal, allocated such supply to other jobs or
clients.
<P>

48	The liquidator also produced cheque butts of the Company's Commonwealth Bank
account no 2607 0010 6580 for the period 11 November
1994 to 18 May 1995.
Additionally copies of all the cheques matching the cheque butts in the exhibit
were obtained from the bank
demonstrating that the cheques were paid to cash
inconsistently with the details on the cheque butt being paid to "Water
Board".
<P>

49	Mr Frank Thomas Arnold swore an affidavit in which he gave evidence of a
series of cash payments and cheque payments to the Company
in 1994 and 1995 in
respect of work done by the Company on his home.  Mr Arnold referred to various
cash receipts provided to him
by Mrs Kenna at the time of the cash payments to
the Company. The receipts issued to Mr Arnold for cash payments had a sequence
from
89 to 93 whereas the receipt number for a cheque payment that Mr Arnold
made was 160411.
<P>

50	The liquidator gave evidence that he had never been provided with the cash
receipts book of the Company and he was unable to
locate any cash payments made
to the Company from 1 July 1994 to 2 June 1995.  In the circumstances the
liquidator was unable to
ascertain whether the receipts issued from the cash
receipts book of the Company in the sequence referred to by Mr Arnold were ever
properly recorded in the books and records of the Company.  
<P>

51	Additionally the liquidator gave evidence that he could not locate files
relating to the Douglas Park property and a property
at Kanahooka.  He could
not locate the cash payments journal after 31 December 1994 nor the asset
register since 30 June 1994.  He
was also unable to locate a cash receipts book
from 1 January 1994 and a building contract for 182 Foothill Road Corrimal.
Most of
these documents were the ones referred to by Mrs Kenna as having
<i>disappeared.</i>
<P>

52	The liquidator was cross examined by Mr Conomy about the types of documents
he did locate and it was suggested that those documents
of prime entry were
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Corporations Law and that the
Company had not breached <i>s289.</i>
<P>

53	<i>Section 289</i> is predicated on the accounting records that are
available being accurate.  The significant and insurmountable obstacle to the
suggestion
made by Mr Conomy in this regard is the falsity of the entries in
these documents of prime entry.
<P>

54	Mr Conomy's cross examination also suggested that if the moneys were taken
from the company and utilised on the Douglas Park
property without authority of
the Company one would not expect to find them in the Company's records.
<P>

55	One problem with that argument being accepted is that when the cash was
received it was an authorised receipt by the Company
and should have been
recorded in the company's records.
<P>

56	Mr Conomy further suggested that if the books and records that had
disappeared were made available to the liquidator then he
would be satisfied
that the Company's records complied with s289 of the Corporations Law.
<P>

57	All of these arguments are flawed by the falsity of the documents of prime
entry and are thereby doomed to failure.
<P>

58	The false entries on the cheque butts, the failure to record the cash
received by the Company, the false entries in the allocation
to jobs other than
the Douglas Park property, the keeping of a separate little journal which was
not provided to the accountant and
the failure to inform the accountant of the
cash that was received and paid to Mr Kenna are all factors which lead me to
the irresistible
conclusion that the records of this Company were such that:
<P>

	(i)	true and fair accounts of the Company could not be prepared from time to
time;  and
<P>

	(ii)	accounts could not be conveniently and properly audited or reviewed.
<P>

59	I am satisfied that the Company was in breach of <i>s 289</i> of the
Corporations Law and in the circumstances it must be presumed that the Company
was insolvent at least from 1 April 1995 <i>(s 588E(4) of the Corporations
Law).</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Insolvency</b>
<P>

60	<i>Section 95A(2) of the Corporations Law</i> provides that a person who is
not solvent is insolvent and <i>s 95A(a)</i> provides that a person is solvent
if, and only if, the person is able to pay all the person's debts as and when
they become due and
payable. 
<P>

61	Insolvency is a question of fact to be determined in all the circumstances
<i>(Sandell v Porter <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%20115%20CLR%20666" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 115 CLR 666)</a></i> and is to be decided as a matter

<P>

62	When the Court is deciding whether or not a company was unable to pay its
debts as and when they fell due it is not embarking
upon "a mere accounting
exercise".  It is assessing whether moneys can be "readily mustered in order to
pay creditors".  It takes
prevailing business practices into account including
the practice that "commercial debtors funded on borrowed capital endeavour to
minimise their payment of interest to their own financiers by delaying payment
to creditors for as long as realistically possible".

<P>

63	The test in s 95A of the Corporations Law has been referred to as a cash
flow test rather than a balance sheet test of insolvency<i> (Melbase Corp Pty

<P>

64	Mr Thomson submits that there is clear and cogent evidence of insolvency as
at 1 January 1995.  This submission is based in part
on analysis of the
accounts for the year ended 30 June 1994 and the half yearly accounts for the
period ended 31 December 1994.
<P>

65	The income statement in the December accounts recorded the comparison
between the position as at 30 June 1994 $647,173 profit
with $25,936 loss as at
31 December 1994.
<P>

66	The Company's work in progress as at 30 June 1994 was assessed at
$1,002,653 and at 31 December 1994 at $849,638.  It is submitted
that these
figures demonstrate that even though the Company had completed some of its
works with consequent cash receivables it was
still trading at a gross loss.
<P>

67	The receivables were down from $98,421 for the twelve month period to June
1994 to $27,740 for the 6 month period to December
1994.
<P>

68	It was further submitted that a comparison of current assets against current
liabilities in the balance sheet in December 1994
demonstrates that the Company
did not have the capacity to meet its then current liabilities in the short
term.  However the following
note appeared in the financial statements of
December 1994:
<P>

	<i>Going Concern</i>
<P>

	<i>The trust has a deficiency of trust funds of $311,064.  The continuance of
the trust as a going concern is dependent upon the ability
of the trust to
continue to raise sufficient finance for its working capital needs.  Certain
beneficiaries of the fund have advanced
moneys to the trust and have undertaken
to advance such further sums as may be necessary until such time as profitable
operations
are resumed and the accumulated losses of the trust have been
eliminated.  Accordingly, the accounts of the trust have been prepared
on the
basis of a going concern</i>
<P>

69	Gummow J considered a similar note in<i> Re New World Alliance Pty Ltd
(Receiver and Manager appointed);  Sycotex Pty Ltd v Baseler <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1994/1117.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] FCA 1117</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2051%20FCR%20425" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 51 FCR
425</a></i>.<i>  </i>In that case the note stated that the financial accounts had
been prepared on an ongoing basis but the validity of that approach was
dependent upon continuing financial support of the holding companies and local
financiers.  The note specifically referred to the
fact that the auditors had
not obtained evidence that continuing support would be available from those
sources.
<P>

70	I am faced with a situation that is a little different.  The accountants who
prepared the note in this case said that <i>certain beneficiaries</i> <i>had
undertaken to advance such further sums that may be necessary until profitable
operations were resumed.</i>
<P>

71	After an analysis of the evidence in <i>New World Alliance</i> Gummow J
reached the conclusion that those managing New World could not rely on the
group as a source of finance <i>(at 432 d - e)</i> and no reliance could be
placed upon an accommodation being available <i>(at 436).</i>
<P>

72	Mr Thomson submits that in this case the only inference that is available on
the evidence is that there were no such undertakings
as referred to in the
going concern note.  He submits that if there had been a capacity to call upon
such an undertaking the time
to do so had well and truly arrived in late 1994
when it is clear that the Company was <i>stretched</i> and certainly required
additional funding. 
<P>

73	There was no evidence that any such support was furnished or any undertaking
called up even when the Company's banker refused
to extend its facilities. Mr
Brown gave evidence that he did not give such an undertaking and he was not
aware of anybody else giving
such an undertaking. In evidence at the public
examination Mrs Kenna said she did not give such an undertaking. In those
circumstances
it is submitted that no undertakings sufficient to carry the
Company through and render it solvent were available. It seems to me
that such
a conclusion is justified on the evidence and it is the conclusion that I have
reached.
<P>

74	Mr Thomson also relied on what could be described as a wealth of evidence in
the documentary exhibits prepared by the liquidator
and supplemented by the
oral evidence from him. 
<P>

75	Further factors upon which Mr Thomson relied include:
<P>

&#183;	 the fact that further funding was needed and was not obtained.
<P>

&#183;	 a pattern of payments to creditors being delayed and cheques being held
back; and
<P>

&#183;	 Mr Brown's evidence that;
<P>

&#183;	 the Company had been increasing its level of activity with three new
significant projects in the second half of 1994 and
the subsequent employment
of two additional supervisors;
<P>

&#183;	 such steps had been taken without any increase in the funding or
working capital of the Company;
<P>

&#183;	 the Company was <i>stretched </i>in late 1994; and
<P>

&#183;	 although it was clear additional funding would be needed it was not
obtained.
<P>

76	In all of these circumstances it is submitted that the Company was as at 1
April 1995 unable to pay its debts as and when they
became due and payable.
<P>

77	Mr Conomy submitted that the plaintiff had not proved that any particular
debt was incurred between 1 April 1995 and 2 June 1995
when the administrator
was appointed.
<P>

78	In support of this submission Mr Conomy focused on the proofs of debt that
had been lodged with the liquidator and his evidence
that he <i>had accepted
the claims on face value and put all the proofs of debt and claims under
consideration.</i>
<P>

79	The liquidator agreed that he had approached the insolvency issue by a
"short cut" method of seeking to establish insolvency
pursuant to the
presumption available in circumstances proved under s 588E(4) of the
Corporations Law.  He also conceded that he
could not specifically recall
sighting any demand from a creditor for payment in the Company's records.
Additionally Mr Conomy submitted
that I would have regard to the fact that no
creditor was called to give evidence and there was no evidence of a pattern of
dishonoured
cheques.
<P>

80	However Mr Conomy's client, Mr Brown, the third defendant, was asked a
number of questions about the items listed in a document
referred to as
Schedule N in exhibit B3 entitled "Creditors Invoices due for payment". At
pages 188 - 189 of exhibit B3 there appears
a list of what is described as
outstanding invoices as at 2 June 1995 prepared by Affective Services Pty Ltd
in June 1995.  It seems
to me from the cross examination of Mr Brown that he
accepted that, with some exceptions to which I shall refer, the goods and
services
claimed to have been provided by Affective Services Pty Ltd to the
Company had been provided.
<P>

81	The exceptions were The Grove, Austinmer (apparently also known as Hill
Street Austinmer), 4 Rosemount Street Wollongong and
Thirroul Kindergarten.
<P>

82	The alleged debts owed to Affective Services about which Mr Brown was cross
examined are listed in Schedule N in the months in
which it is alleged they
fell due for payment . The liquidator gave evidence that Schedule N had been
prepared after the financial
records of the Company had been perused by himself
and his staff. He said that the terms and conditions of invoices issued by most
of those creditors required payment within 30 days or less.
<P>

83	I do not agree with Mr Conomy's submission.  I am satisfied that the debts
alleged to be owed to Affective Services have been
proved by the plaintiff.
Additionally  it is open on the evidence to conclude that Mr Brown accepted
that at least the following
debts were owed to that company:
<P>

	(i)	For March 1995 <i>$8104.50</i> which takes into account the exclusion of 4
Rosemount Street, Hill Street and Thirroul Kindergarten.
<P>

	(ii)	For April 1995 <i>$71,593</i>, taking into account the exclusion of 4
Rosemount Street and Hill Street.
<P>

	(iii)	For May 1995 <i>$43,205</i> taking into account the exclusion of the The
Grove; and
<P>

	(iv)	For June 1995 <i>$249,700.65</i> excluding 4 Rosemount Street; 
<P>

84	The liquidator also gave evidence that prior to the day upon which he gave
evidence no person other than Mr Kenna had suggested
that the details relating
to the creditors listed in schedule N were other than substantially correct.
The reference to Mr Kenna
taking issue with the list of the creditors in
schedule N and the dates upon which the debts were alleged to have been
incurred was
dealt with in cross examination. However no evidence was called
which seriously contested the evidence of the liquidator.
<P>

85	Mr Conomy submitted that I should feel some disquiet in making any finding
in relation to insolvency based on Schedule N and
the documentary materials
exhibited in support of it. He submitted this disquiet would exist because
<i>what things were done as to individual accounts are not before the court and
it would be a matter for conjecture as to whether there
is an oral contract
which predates an invoice which would override a term that appears on an
invoice.</i> He said he would try to <i>marshal some schedule in that
respect.</i>
<P>

86	No such schedule was marshalled or if it was it certainly was not tendered.
Schedule N refers to the conditions of the individual
invoices and from that
and the supporting documentary materials I am entitled to reach a conclusion
that the terms of trading as
referred to by the liquidator are as he stated. It
seems to me that it would be quite unrealistic for me to entertain the disquiet
based on the matters outlined in Mr Conomy's submission. I am dealing with
matters of commercial reality on the evidence before me
and I see no good
reason to entertain this particular disquiet.
<P>

87	On the evidence before me I am satisfied that the identity of the creditors,
the debts and the dates upon which the debts are
alleged to have arisen as
listed of Schedule N and described in the legend <i>Payment terms
(</i>excluding those with the legends <i>%</i> and <i>@</i>) did in fact arise
as described in the schedule. 
<P>

88	The liquidator also gave evidence that his analysis of the Company's records
demonstrated that  cheques were being held back
and not presented to the Bank
as one would expect in the ordinary course of business.  The inference is
available that the holding
back of cheques in the circumstances of this
Company's affairs is an indication that there were not sufficient funds in the
account
and/or the overdraft at the Bank to meet the debts as they fell due.
<P>

89	Hodgson CJ in Eq said that the question as to whether a company was able to
pay its debts as and when they fell due ;
<P>

	<i>..is to be decided as a matter of commercial reality, in the light of the
circumstances... the company's financial condition in its
entirety, including
its activities, assets, liabilities, cash, money which it could procure by sale
or on the security of its assets,
and its ability to obtain financial
assistance by way of loan or subscription for share capital.</i>

<P>

	<i>(b)	a reasonable person in a like position in a company in the company's

<P>

93	Section 588G(1)(c) raises the question whether at the time the debts were
incurred there were reasonable grounds for suspecting
that the company was or
would become insolvent.  The answer to this question involves an objective
assessment in the context of an
assumption of the directors' compliance with
their statutory obligations.
<P>

94	This includes the obligation to be sufficiently familiar with the company's
affairs so as to be in a position to make a proper
judgment about its financial
position.  The assessment of reasonable grounds for such suspicion uses as a
touchstone the director
seeking properly to perform his or her duties in such
circumstances.  In this regard it is a director of reasonable competence,
exercising
the care and diligence that a reasonable person might be expected to
take in the same circumstances (<i>Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Friedrich

<P>

95	Mr Thomson submits that the "<i>circumstances"</i> to be taken into account
in answering this question include:
<P>

&#183;		The Company's parlous state of  financial affairs as disclosed by the
June 30 1994 financial statements.
<P>

&#183;		The commencement of three large projects in 1994 and early 1995 which
were unfunded and in circumstances where no cash flow
projection had been made
and no budget prepared;
<P>

&#183;		The employment of two additional site supervisors in the same
circumstances;
<P>

&#183;	 	The failure to obtain extra funding from the Company's banker from
late 1994 when the Company was <i>stretched;</i>
<P>

&#183;	 	The failure to obtain funding from the Company's banker in March 1995
and between March 1995 and June 1995;
<P>

&#183;	 	The continuation of trading in circumstances where no additional
funding had been obtained;
<P>

&#183;	<i> </i>	the outstanding debts due to the Company's suppliers and
contractors as at 1 April 1995 and later as identified in the liquidator's
evidence including schedule N;
<P>

&#183;		The construction of the Douglas Park property in 1994 and 1995 in the
circumstances of the Company's subcontractors being
used to assist in that
construction.
<P>

96	Although the defendants placed emphasis upon the lack of any evidence of
formal demand for payment on the Company and the absence
of any pattern of
dishonoured cheques I am of the view that such does not detract from the cogent
evidence to which I have had regard
in reaching my conclusion. I am satisfied
pursuant to <i>s588G(1)(c) </i>on all the evidence that by April 1995 there
were reasonable grounds for suspecting that the Company was insolvent or would
become
insolvent as it incurred the debts referred to in schedule N for the
period April 1 1995 to June 1995.
<P>

97	The further amended statement of claim alleges that both Mr Kenna and Mr
Brown were aware at the time when the Company incurred
the debts that there
were grounds for suspecting the Company was then insolvent at the time each
such debt was so incurred. <i>(s588(2)(a))</i>  The particulars of the matters
which the plaintiffs claim are relevant to the awareness it claims existed in
the minds of both Mr
Kenna and Mr Brown are as follows:
<P>

<i>97.1.	The financial statements of the Company as at 30 June 1994 which were
prepared in about December 1994 and given to the defendants
at the time
disclosed:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	That trade creditors of the Company had increased from $454, 585 to
$805,845.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	The overdraft account of the Company had increased from $52,304 to
$153,564.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	Loans owed by the Company had increased from $142,403 to
$223,165;</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	Nett assets of the Company exceeded liabilities of the Company by only
$30,000.</i>
<P>

<i>97.2	The Company's debts were continually ageing.</i>
<P>

<i>97.3	The Company incurred large amounts of debts with other creditors in
excess of previous levels of indebtedness to creditors.</i>
<P>

<i>97.4	From prior to 1 April 1995 to 2 June 1995 the Company was experiencing
a cash flow problem.</i>
<P>

<i>97.5	In March 1995 the Company was unsuccessful in obtaining re-finance from
its banker.</i>
<P>

<i>97.6	Creditors of the Company were not paid within agreed trading
terms.</i>
<P>

<i>97.7	By letter dated 2 June 1995 the first defendant wrote to creditors of
the Company and informed them that the Company had experienced
financial
hardship during the previous six months causing a cash flow problem which it
could not overcome;  and</i>
<P>

<i>97.8	In excess of $1,466,468 was owed to creditors prior to 1 April 1995 and
has never been repaid.</i>
<P>

98	Alternatively the plaintiffs' claim that a reasonable person in a like
position to Mr Kenna and Mr Brown's position in the Company
in the Company's
circumstances would have been aware at the time when the Company incurred the
debt that there were grounds for suspecting
that the Company was then
insolvent<i>.  (s 588G(2)(b))</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><u>Mr Kenna</u>
<P>

99	In the circumstances of his bankruptcy there was no appearance by or for Mr
Kenna to put any matters to the Court in his defence
however I have considered
the evidence and the claims against him for the purposes of this aspect of the
plaintiffs' claims.
<P>

100	There were in evidence before me two Minutes purporting to be Minutes of a
meeting of directors on 16 December 1994 and the
1994 annual general meeting on
30 December 1994 signed respectively by Mr Kenna as director and chairman. Both
minutes record Mr
Brown as having been present. Mr Brown denied he was present
at those meetings. The Company's financial statements for the year ending
30
June 1994 were purportedly adopted at the general meeting and at the directors
meeting it was noted in the Statement by Directors
that;
<P>

<i>	(c) 	as at the date of this resolution, there are reasonable grounds to
believe that the company will be able to pay its debts as
and when they fall
due; and</i>
<P>

<i>	(e)...the company has;</i>
<P>

<i>	(i) kept such accounting records as correctly record and explain the
transactions and financial position of the company;</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii) kept its accounting records in such a manner as would enable true and
fair financial statements of the company to be prepared
from time to time;
and</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii) kept its accounting records in such a manner as would enable the
financial statements of the company to be conveniently and
properly audited in
accordance with the Corporations Law.</i>
<P>

101	Mr Kenna was the signatory of the cheques paid to the various contractors
for the construction of the Douglas Park property.
These payments were not
accurately described in the Company's records and Mr Kenna must have been aware
that the Company's records
were not as described in the above minute.
<P>

102	In assessing the evidence I have been careful not to use the evidence of
Mrs Kenna in the public examination against Mr Kenna.
The evidence of Mr Brown,
Mrs Rowlands and Mr Arnold demonstrates that cash was received by the company
certainly in 1994 and/or
1995.It is clear that such cash was given to Mr Kenna.
The liquidator's evidence demonstrates that such cash was not banked and was
not entered in the records of the Company. 
<P>

103	It is also clear from the evidence of Mr Brown, to which I shall refer in
detail below, that the Company was <i>stretched </i>in the latter part of 1994.
It is also clear that further funding was needed and that it had not been
obtained. Additional large projects
were taken on by the Company in 1994 and
1995 without additional funding, a budget and or flow projection. I am
satisfied that Mr
Kenna was not only aware of these matters but also of the
list of creditors who remained unpaid as referred to in Schedule N of the
liquidator's evidence.
<P>

104	Mr Kenna was the director with the hands on financial management of the
Company.  I am satisfied that he was aware that the
diversion of the Company's
funds to him and to the Douglas Park property would add that extra burden on
the Company such as to amount
to an awareness that there were grounds for
suspecting the Company was insolvent as at 1 April 1995.
<P>

105	In these circumstances I am satisfied pursuant to both <i>s588G(2)(a)</i>
and s<i>588G(2)(b)</i> that Mr Kenna has contravened <i>s588G of the
Corporations Law.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><u>Mr Brown</u>
<P>

106	Mr Conomy submits that I would not be satisfied that Mr Brown was aware at
the relevant time that there were such grounds for
so
suspecting<i>(s588G(2)(a))</i>. In support of this submission he referred to
the following matters:
<P>

&#183;		The financial statements of the Company as at 30 June 1994 appear to
have been created in December 1994 and Mr Brown was
not present at the 1994
meeting with the accountant which would have usually included an explanation of
the accounts; 
<P>

&#183;		Although Mr Brown accepted that he had received a copy of the accounts
he said that he did not receive any explanation of
them;
<P>

&#183;		In observing the extension of the Company's activities it was
reasonable to assume the Company's trade creditors would increase;
and  
<P>

&#183;		Mr Brown was not aware of the specific amount of the overdraft at any
particular time including the time that he signed
the application for the
extension of the overdraft in March 1995.
<P>

107	Mr Conomy submitted that there was really little support for the
plaintiffs' case in any reliance upon the fact that Mr Brown
had a copy of the
30 June 1994 financial statements to demonstrate a relevant awareness under
<i>s588G(2)(a). </i> Certainly the plaintiffs do rely on such a circumstance
and that reliance is very understandable.  But Mr Conomy points to paragraph
38
of Mr Brown's affidavit which he says should cause any support to be <i>largely
discounted</i>.  Paragraph 38 states;
<P>

	<i>I have never been formally trained nor have I otherwise acquired the
ability to read and interpret accounting records or financial
statements. At
all times I relied upon the first and/or the second defendant and/or Mr
Brangwin to inform me of the financial position
of the plaintiff </i>
<P>

	Mr Conomy submits that this evidence was not challenged.
<P>

108	Mr Brown was cross examined about these financial statements and more
particularly about the Company's financial position. His
oral evidence included
the following;
<P>

&#183;	 	He did not ever make any request of Mr or Mrs Kenna or Mr Brangwin to
keep him informed of the Company's financial position;
<P>

&#183;	 	He received a copy of the 30 June 1994 accounts in about December
1994;
<P>

&#183;	  	It had been his practice to go to Mr Brangwin's office at Parramatta
every 12 months for the approval of the accounts
at which time the accountant
would explain them;
<P>

&#183;	 	He did not attend the accountant at the time the 30 June 1994 accounts
were prepared because he was <i>too busy</i> and had<i> quite a few jobs to
look after at that time;</i>
<P>

&#183;	 	He did not receive an explanation in respect of these particular
financial statements;
<P>

&#183;	 	He was aware that the Company was <i>stretched </i>in late 1994.
<P>

109	The following cross examination is important on this aspect of the case
against Mr Brown;
<P>

	<i>Q.	 It was apparent to you.. .that this extra level of activity would
generate an increased level of expenditure, at least for the
duration of these
projects?</i>
<P>

	<i>A. 	Yes</i>
<P>

	<i>Q.	When did you and he (Mr Kenna) first discuss the need to approach the
bank or otherwise obtain additional funding to enable the
company to cope with
this increased level of building activity it was undertaking?</i>
<P>

	<i>A 	It must have been around about April of 1995</i>
<P>

	<i>Q.	 22 March.. Was that the first occasion that you learned that any steps
were being taken in that regard?</i>
<P>

	<i>A.	Yes .</i>
<P>

	<i>Q. 	<b>Even though it was pretty evident I suggest that the company would
need further funding?</b></i>
<P>

<b><i>	A.	Yes it was evident.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Q. 	Because there was no expectation that the company's cash flows would
dramatically increase sufficiently to cover the additional
expenditure, was
there?</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	A.	No				(tr.83-84)(emphasis added)</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b><i>Q.	Were there any steps taken to enable the company to fund
that increased level of activity between 93 and 94 to your knowledge?</i>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b><i>A. 	Not that I know of, not that I know of.		(tr 87)</i>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>And later in relation to the application to the Bank for further
funding;
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b><i>Q	And you were aware that it was not available?</i>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b><i>A.	It wasn't</i>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b><i>Q.	It wasn't obtained?</i>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b><i>A.	It wasn't obtained. It was to be - as far as I knew it was
to be resubmitted.</i>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b><i>Q.	 Anyway it wasn't obtained before the company ceased
trading?</i>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b><i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b><i>Q.	And it was likely I suggest if you turned your mind to it,
that in such circumstances the amount of unsecured creditors would increase,
given that the company was continuing with its trading activities in the
interim.</i>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b><i>A.	Yes.					(tr.98)</i>
<P>

110	Mr Brown was not asked whether in fact he did turn his mind to the
circumstance referred to in this last question. However I
understand that
having regard to Mr Brown's admitted awareness that;
<P>

<b><i>&#183;	</i></b> 	the Company was stretched in late 1994 when extra
projects were taken on;
<P>

<b><i>&#183;	</i></b> 	there was a  need for further funding;
<P>

<b><i>&#183;	</i></b> 	there was no expectation that the Company's cash flows
would increase to cover the additional expenditure; and
<P>

<b><i>&#183;	</i></b> 	there was no extra funding obtained;
<P>

the plaintiffs submit  that I would be satisfied that Mr Brown did have the
requisite awareness referred to in <i>s588(2)(a).</i>
<P>

111	The evidence also discloses that Mr Brown left the management of the
Company to Mr and Mrs Kenna. Although he did discuss finances
with Mr Kenna
when he came to the site it is apparent the discussion was not detailed. There
was no delay in payment of his wages
which were paid weekly. He was not aware
of any demand for payment or complaint by creditors at the site or lack of
supply of goods
and services because of non payment.
<P>

112	He only became aware that the three new large projects had been taken on
after they were taken on. The cross examination also
elicited that;
<P>

<b>&#183;	<i>	</i></b>he did not know that since 1992 the Company had not
banked any cash (although by the time he gave his evidence he said it would not
surprise him);
<P>

<b>&#183;	</b><i> </i>	he was not aware before the day that he gave his
evidence that the trust had a deficiency of funds of $311.000 as at 31 December
1994; and
<P>

<b>&#183;	</b><i> 	</i> he was surprised that the level of unsecured
creditors<b> </b>was as high as $1.3m.
<P>

113	Mr Brown was persuasive in his cross examination about his lack of
cognisance of the depth of the Company's problems. I formed
this view even
though he admitted he knew the Company was stretched. This of course does not
mean that his approach was reasonable,
indeed it seems to me that his approach
was not reasonable. Although he was relying on others he did not consult
properly with those
others to ascertain the true state of the Company's
financial affairs. But that is not a matter which concerns me in the
consideration
of this aspect of Mr Brown's defence. I have concluded that he
was not aware that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that the
company
was or would become insolvent.
<P>

114	In all the circumstances I am not satisfied that Mr Brown had the requisite
awareness referred to in s<i>588G(2)(a).</i> However the matters to which Mr
Thomson has referred and the evidence generally leads me to the conclusion that
a reasonable person
in a like position in the Company to that of Mr Brown in
the Company's circumstances would be so aware <i>(s588G(2)(b))</i>.
<P>

115	I am therefore satisfied Mr Brown has contravened  <i>s588G of the
Corporations Law.</i>
<P>

	<u>Mr Brown's defences</u>
<P>

116	The defences pleaded on Mr Brown's behalf in respect of that contravention
is as follows:
<P>

	<i>4  The third defendant says that at the time the debts referred to in the
further amended statement of claim were incurred, he had
reasonable grounds to
expect, and he did expect, that the Company was solvent at the time and would
remain solvent even if it incurred
those debts.</i>  <i> (the s588H(2) defence)
</i>
<P>

	<i>5  The third defendant says that at all material times he had reasonable
grounds to believe, and did so believe, that a competent
and reliable person
was responsible for providing to him adequate information about whether the
company was solvent and that person
was fulfilling that responsibility and he
expected, on the basis of the information provided to him, that the plaintiff
was solvent
at the time it incurred the debts and would remain solvent even if
it incurred the debts.</i>
<P>

	<i>Particulars	</i>
<P>

<center>	<i>The first and/or second defendants had responsibility for informing
the third defendant of the position of the plaintiffs.  The third
defendant was
provided with information from time to time by the first and/or second
defendants.  On the basis of this information
the third defendant expected that
the plaintiff was solvent.  (the s588H(3) defence)</i></center>
<P>

117	On the first day of the hearing, 6 April 1999, leave was granted,
unopposed, to the third defendant to amend his defence to
include the following
paragraph:
<P>

	<i>In answer to the whole of the claim and in so far as these proceedings
against him are for negligence, default, breach of trust or
breach of duty the
third defendant claims an order of the Court relieving him of his liability on
the ground that he has acted honestly
and ought fairly to be excused under s
1318 of the Corporations Law.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><u>The s588H(2) defence</u>
<P>

118	Mr Conomy places emphasis upon Mr Brown's background as a qualified
carpenter and the fact that from 1964 when he and Mr Kenna
first went into
business together it has always been Mr Kenna <i>alone </i>(that is without Mr
Brown's involvement) who attended to the financial affairs of the partnership.
He paid all the creditors and kept
the books and records of the business - both
for the partnership and later the Company. In later years he was assisted by
Mrs Kenna
and Mr Brangwin. This had been the agreed division of their duties in
the partnership and later the Company.
<P>

119	Mr Conomy relied on par 38 of Mr Brown's affidavit extracted above to
demonstrate Mr Brown's lack of expertise in financial
matters.(<i>Standard
Chartered v Antico (supra at 332)) </i> Mr Brown's affidavit also stated in
paragraph 16;
<P>

	<i>To the best of my knowledge and belief (Mr Kenna) provided the .. financial
information to Mr Brangwin and Mr Brangwin reviewed that
information quarterly
from 1973 until..June 1995.</i>
<P>

120	In 1984 Mr Brown was involved in a conversation in which it was agreed with
Mr Brangwin that the financial information necessary
to prepare monthly
accounts for the Company would be sent to him at the end of each month by Mrs
Kenna so that he could prepare them
and <i>keep an eye on them</i> for the
Company.  Mr Brown said he had the <i>belief </i>that this system was in place
from 1984 <i>throughout the period,</i> presumably until June 1995.
<P>

121	In 1987 Mr Brangwin raised some concerns about some of the Company's
properties causing a <i>financial drain </i>on the Company and advised Messrs
Kenna and Brown to sell the properties to get rid of the burden on the Company.
He told them that
they needed to act immediately and that he would <i>keep an
eye on the accounts </i>after the properties were sold and let them know<i> if
there is any further problem.</i>
<P>

122	Mr Brangwin did not raise any further concerns at any of the meetings Mr
Brown attended with him nor did he indicate <i>that the Company was
experiencing or could anticipate any other financial difficulties. </i>Mr Brown
said <i>I never received anything from him saying that we were insolvent,</i>
and he assumed<i> we would have been solvent.</i>
<P>

123	However Mr Brown said that he <i>made express inquiry </i>of<i> </i>Mrs
Kenna as to the Company's solvency on or about 22 March 1995. She rang him and
asked him to go into the office to sign a document
for the bank. She informed
him she was <i>attempting to refinance the Company's loan arrangements because
of the number of large projects </i>the Company had at that time. He said that
when he attended the office and Mrs Kenna gave him the document he said <i>What
is this all about?</i> to which Mrs Kenna responded <i>Its a statement to say
the Company is solvent</i> in response to which he said <i>Is it</i>? And Mrs
Kenna said  <i>yes.</i>
<P>

124	Mr Brown gave evidence before the Registrar in the public examination in
October 1995.  The following evidence is relevant to
the conversation of 22
March 1995;
<P>

<i>	Q	And were you aware in March or April of this year that Mr Kenna was
attempting to refinance the loan arrangements of the company.</i>
<P>

<i>	A	No I wasn't aware of that.		(Tr 40 exhibit C)</i>
<P>

<i>	Q	Have you got a document there that says "Declaration of Solvency"
addressed to the Commonwealth Bank dated 22 March 1995.</i>
<P>

<i>	A	Yeah I see that, yeah.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q	Can you remember signing that document.</i>
<P>

<i>	A	I can, I can remember signing but I didn't read it.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q	And what were the circumstances in which you signed it.</i>
<P>

<i>	A	I think I was called into the office one afternoon, I had to call there
to sign a document for the bank.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q	Okay and did you ask what the document was.</i>
<P>

<i>	A	Yes, I said "what's it for?"</i>
<P>

<i>	Q	And what did he say.</i>
<P>

<i>	A	It was Trish that got me to sign it.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q	What did she say.</i>
<P>

<i>	A	She said it was just a statement for the bank.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q	And you didn't bother to read that document.</i>
<P>

<i>	A	I'm afraid I didn't read that part.  I didn't read the</i> <i>declaration
of solvency</i>.		<i>(Tr 42 -43 exhibit C)</i>
<P>

125	Mr Brown was not taken to this portion of his evidence before the
Registrar. It is somewhat inconsistent with the conversation
that he gave in
evidence before me particularly in relation to the statement about the solvency
of the Company.  
<P>

126	Mr Brown relies upon his evidence before me to support his claim that he
had an expectation that the Company was solvent and
would remain solvent even
if it incurred further debts.   He also relies on this evidence to support his
claim that he had reasonable
grounds for such an expectation.
<P>

127	I accept that Mr Brown left the management of the Company to Mr and Mrs
Kenna.  I also accept that he relied upon Mr Brangwin
for explanation of the
accounts each year when he attended his office in Parramatta.  Additionally I
accept in the light of Mr Brangwin's
previous concern having been expressed in
1987 about the financial drain on the Company and his stated intention to bring
any further
problems to notice that Mr Brown was entitled to expect that Mr
Brangwin would bring such to his notice. 
<P>

128	Although he gave evidence that he had a practice of seeing Mr Brangwin each
year for the approval and explanation of the accounts
Mr Brown did not attend a
meeting at which the 30 June 1994 accounts were approved. His evidence in the
public examination suggests
he had not seen Mr Brangwin since about December
1993. His explanation was that he was too busy. There is no evidence that he
had
any discussion at all in 1994 with Mr Brangwin or Mr Kenna about the
financial position of the company prior to the very short conversation
he had
with Mrs Kenna in March 1995. 
<P>

129	This is curious in the circumstances particularly as Mr Brown said he was
aware that the Company needed extra funds and that
it was <i>stretched</i> in
late 1994. There was also the peculiar situation that as a director of the
company he was not informed that the company was taking
on three new large
projects until after they were commenced. The employment of the two additional
site supervisors without extra
funding being obtained, with no expectation that
the company's cash flows would increase sufficiently to cover the additional
expenditure
makes the lack of communication about the Company's financial
position even more puzzling. 
<P>

130	Notwithstanding Mr Brown's expectation that Mr Brangwin would let him know
about any further problems these circumstances developed
some 7 years after
that conversation with Mr Brangwin in 1987. There is no doubt Mr Brown was
aware of these circumstances and they
should have alerted Mr Brown to the need
not only for some sensible communication about the Company's financial position
but also
for appropriate action to address the situation.
<P>

131	In all these circumstances, even if I were to accept that Mr Brown expected
the Company was solvent and would remain solvent
because no one told him
otherwise I am of the view that he did not have reasonable grounds for that
expectation. This defence must
fail.
<P>

<i>	</i><u>The s588H(3) defence</u>
<P>

132	As I have said above in relation to the s588H(2) defence Mr Brown obviously
relied upon Mr and Mrs Kenna to manage the Company
and upon Mr Brangwin to
bring certain matters to his attention in relation to the financial affairs of
the Company.  However there
was one matter of which Mr Brown was aware about
which he had some concern which prompted him to make some enquiry of Mr Kenna.
It
involved the receipt of cash by the Company.
<P>

133	He gave evidence that when the business changed from being a partnership to
a Company he asked Mr Kenna what was going to happen
in relation to the cash
received by the Company. His evidence was that it was not unusual for payments
to be made to the Company
in cash. Mr Kenna told him that it was going to be
dealt with in exactly the same way that it had been in the partnership.  He
understood
that it would be banked.
<P>

134	He did not enquire about the receipt of cash again until about 1990. His
evidence was as follows:
<P>

<i>	A.	Well I asked another time, later on, and I was given virtually the same
answer as  what I was given the first time.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q	What was his response.</i>
<P>

<i>	A	It was virtually the same statement;  that cash was - I had no knowledge
of cash being paid at that time, it was just a question
on another part and the
answer was cash was no different, once again, that cash was no different to a
cheque.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q	What was the context which led you to raise that issue with Mr Kenna at
that time.</i>
<P>

<i>	A	There was a bit of matrimonial dispute between Lance and his wife at the
time, and she told my wife that she took something like
$20,000 out of the draw
at Lance's.  So I was sort of making a comment to try and let him know that I
knew that there was cash there
at that time.  But that was - but I had no other
reason I couldn't say if it was his own or who it belonged to.   					(tr 79-
80)</i>
<P>

<i>	Q	...Anyway the reason for asking the question was to let him know
inferentially, anyway, that you had an interest in what happened
with the
company's cash is that why you did it.</i>
<P>

<i>	A	Yes that's right.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q	But you didn't take it any further.</i>
<P>

<i>	A	No.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q	You didn't do any follow up checks of any kind.</i>
<P>

<i>	A	No.					(tr 81)</i>
<P>

135	As I have said earlier Mr Brown was not told about three new large projects
being taken on by the Company in 1994/95 until after
they were taken on. It is
clear Mr Brown was not being kept informed of the financial situation of the
Company. These projects were
obviously relevant to the Company's financial
situation and it can hardly be said that the responsible person was providing
him with
adequate information about that matter.  
<P>

136	There is no evidence to suggest that once he became aware of the projects
having been taken on he ever spoke to Mr or Mrs Kenna
or Mr Brangwin about them
and their possible impact on the Company's financial position. He was willing
to raise what he seemed to
regard as the delicate question about the cash four
years earlier but he remained silent about what appears to be the less delicate
matter of not being kept informed.
<P>

137	The conversation in March 1995 with Mrs Kenna could reasonably be described
as of a  most cursory nature with no apparent explanation
being sought as to
why he was not told about these projects until after they were taken on.
<P>

138	I am of the view that in all the circumstances Mr Brown did not have
reasonable grounds to believe that he was being adequately
kept informed by the
responsible person about whether the Company was solvent.<i> </i>This defence
must fail.
<P>

<i>	</i><u>The application of s1318</u>
<P>

139	Mr Robinson submitted that his submissions on this aspect of the case were
a little controversial in that their adoption would
require me to take a
somewhat different approach from that taken in <i>Commonwealth Bank of
Australia v Friedrich  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%209%20ACLC%20946" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 9 ACLC 946; (Friedrich)</a>  Standard Chartered Bank v

<P>

140	He distinguishes the present case from the approach taken in those previous
cases by a comparison of the wording of 588G with
its predecessors ss592 and
556.  He submits that s588G with which I am dealing is relevantly different
from those previous sections.
<P>

141	Mr Robinson submits that s556(1) was directed to an offence by the Company.
It provided:
<P>

	<i>556(1)	If - </i>
<P>

	<i>(a)	a company incurs a debt, or whether within or outside the State;
</i>
<P>

	<i>(b)	immediately before the time when the debt is incurred -</i>
<P>

	<i>(i)	there are reasonable grounds to expect that the company will not be
able to pay all its debts as and when they become due;  or</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	there are reasonable grounds to expect that, if the company incurs the
debt, it will not be able to pay all its debts as and
when they become due;
and</i>
<P>

	<i>(c)	the company is, at the time when the debt is incurred, or becomes at a
later time, a company to which this section applies,</i>
<P>

<i>Penalty any person who was a director of the company, or took part in the
management of the company, at the time when the debt was
incurred is guilty of
an offence and the company and that person or, if there are 2 or more such
persons, those persons are jointly
and severally liable for the payment of the
debt.</i>
<P>

<i>	Penalty $5,000 or imprisonment for one year, or both.</i>
<P>

142	A defence was provided for in s556(2) whereby a defendant could prove that
the debt was incurred without express or implied
authority or consent or by
proving that he did not have a reasonable cause to expect the company was
unable to pay its debts. Section
556(3) provided that proceedings could be
brought under subs 1 <i>for the recovery of a debt.</i>
<P>

143	Section 592 was in very similar language to s556 and refers to the<i>
company incurring a debt</i> <i>(s592(1)(a)).</i>
<P>

144	Mr Robinson contrasts these sections with <i>s588G</i> wherein the
contravention is <i>by failing to prevent the company from incurring a
debt</i>. (s<i>588G(2))</i> He submits that this imposition of a duty to
prevent the Company from incurring a debt is something quite different to that
which
is found in the predecessors to the section.
<P>

145	He submitted that <i>s588G(2)</i> imposes an absolute duty on the director
which distinguishes the situation with which I am dealing from that with which
the court
was dealing in <i>Friedrichs, Standard Chartered and Southern
Star</i>.  
<P>

146	Mr Thomson has referred me most helpfully to Mr L Powers article <i>Can the
Court excuse Insolvent Trading?  Journal of Banking and Finance Law and
Practice Vol 7 June 1996 p 160.</i>  Mr Powers suggests that although a court
could not relieve a director who was pursued under <i>s556 of the Companies
Code</i> it can do so when a director is pursued under <i>s588G of the
Corporations Law.(at 160)</i>
<P>

147	After referring to <i>Friedrichs, Standard Chartered and Southern Star</i>
Mr Powers said:
<P>

	<i>.. a new regime applies to debts incurred after 23 June 1993.  Section 558G
of the Corporations Law, which is headed "Directors Duty
to prevent insolvent
trading by a company" makes it an offence for a director to "fail to prevent" a
company from incurring a debt
in the prescribed circumstances.  Had Tadgell J
been dealing with a claim under the Corporations Law, it seems clear he would
have
been able to find what he thought was missing from 556 of the Companies
Code, mainly, liability arising from the doing of acts or,
at least, liability
for failing to do something specifically required by the law.</i>
<P>

148	This was no doubt a reference to <i>Tadgell J's</i> following statement in
<i>Commonwealth Bank v Friedrich (at 1007</i> );
<P>

	<i>...it remains necessary to discern the imposition by s556(1) of a liability
to the plaintiff for a default or breach of duty by the
defendant. I have
difficulty in seeing that s556 imposes by its terms a liability for an act or
omission in contravention of the
Code or for the breach of any duty imposed by
the Code or otherwise.</i>
<P>

	<i>..The liability under s556(1) does not arise on account of..the performance
of some act forbidden, or the omission of some act required,
by s556(1) or
indeed any other provision of the Code. The only prerequisite to the
defendant's liability under s556(1) over which
he has any necessary control is
simply that he was a director or took part in the management of the company.
This cannot by itself
involved him in any default or breach of duty.</i>
<P>

149	In <i>Standard Chartered v Antico</i> <i>Hodgson J</i> (as he then was)
followed <i>Tadgell J</i> saying at 370;
<P>

<i>	..I am not satisfied that Tadgell J was wrong in his view that s556 simply
imposes a liability for debt on directors and participants
in management in
certain circumstances spelt out in s556(1), which do not involve default or
breach of duty.</i>
<P>

150	<i>Hodgson J</i> expressed some concern that the predecessor to <i>s1318 of
the Corporations Law ( s535 of the Code)</i> might operate capriciously because
<i>s556</i> imposed liability on persons who may not be officers of the
company. He went on to say that the broad powers given to the Court in
<i>s535</i> did not sit well with the defence in <i>s556(2)</i> because this
latter section gave <i>some appearance of being a full elaboration of the
circumstances in which the legislature considered that persons falling within
s556(1)
ought to escape liability. (at 371)</i>
<P>

151	Of <i>Hodgson J's</i> concern about the possibility of the capricious
operation of the section Mr Powers said;
<P>

	<i>The point made by Hodgson J concerning the failure of s1318 to cover the
position of persons who were merely involved in management,
and who were not
otherwise officers, also appears to fall away under the new regime.  The new
law imposes liability for insolvent
trading only on directors.  It no longer
applies to persons merely involved in the management of the company.  So if
s1318 applies,
it covers all those who might incur liabilities under
s588G.</i>
<P>

152	As to Hodgson J's opinion that the stated <i>general appearance of
s556(2)</i> did not sit well with<i> s535(s1318)</i> Mr Powers placed reliance
on the notation of the precept by  the High Court in <i>David Grant &amp; Co
Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 43</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2013%20ACLC%201572" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 13 ACLC 1572</a></i>  that it is
inappropriate to read down a provision which grants powers to a court by
imposing limitations not found in the express
words of the section.
<P>

153	<i>Section 1317JA of the Corporations Law </i> provides;
<P>

<i>	1317JA(1):  <b>"Eligible Proceedings" </b>means proceedings for a
contravention of the civil penalty provision (including proceedings under
s588M, 588W or s1317HD of the Corporations
Law of this jurisdiction) but does
not include proceedings for an offence (except so far as the proceedings relate
to the question
whether the court should make an order under s588K or 1317HB of
the law).</i>
<P>

	<i>1317JA(2):  Where, in eligible proceedings against a person, it appears to
the court that the person has, or may have, contravened
a civil penalty
provision but that:</i>
<P>

	<i>(a)	the person has acted honestly;  and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	having regard to all the circumstances of the case (including where
applicable, those connected with the person's appointment
as an officer of a
corporation, of a registered scheme's responsible entity or of a Part 5.47
body), the person ought fairly to be
excused for the contravention</i>;  
<P>

	<i>The Court may relieve the person either wholly or partly from a liability
to which the person would otherwise be subject, or that
might otherwise be
imposed on the person, because of the contravention.</i>
<P>

	<i>1317JA(3):  In determining under subs (2) whether a person ought fairly to
be excused for a contravention of s 588G, the matters to
which regard is to be
had include, but are not limited to:</i>
<P>

	<i>(a)	any action the person took with a view to appointing an administrator
of the company or Part 557 body;  and</i>
<P>

	<i>(b)	when that action was taken;  and</i>
<P>

	<i>(c)	the results of that action.</i>
<P>

	<i>....</i>
<P>

<i>	1317JA(7)	Nothing in this section limits, or is limited by, s1318.</i>
<P>

154	<i>s1318(1)</i> provides:
<P>

	<i>If, in any civil proceedings against a person to whom this section applies
for negligence, default, breach of trust or breach of duty
in a capacity as
such a person, it appears to the Court before which the proceedings are taken
that the person is or may be liable
in respect of the negligence, default of
breach but that the person has acted honestly and that, having regard to all
the circumstances
of the case, including those connected with the person's
appointment, the person ought fairly to be excused for the negligence, default
or breach, the Court may relieve the person either wholly or partly from
liability on such terms as the Court thinks fit.  </i>
<P>

155	Mr Powers concludes;
<P>

	<i>Whatever the limits of s1318..the power of the court to grant relief in
respect of liability for insolvent trading now seems to be
beyond doubt as a
result of the introduction of s1317A. This section operates in addition to
s1318.</i> 
<P>

	<i>Now, in "eligible proceedings" the court is given specific power to grant
relief. Eligible proceedings means proceedings "for a contravention
of a civil
penalty provision"..Section 588G is a civil penalty provision. Contravention of
the duty in s588G is the basis for civil
recovery action by a liquidator (or a
creditor in certain circumstances). Therefore the power to grant relief is not
limited to proceedings
in which the ASC is seeking a civil penalty order. In
both situations the action can be properly said to be proceedings "for a
contravention".</i>
<P>

156	I agree with Mr Powers' conclusion.  I am also of the view that because of
the imposition of the duty in <i>s588G </i>the reservations expressed by
Tadgell J in <i>Friedrich</i>,  Hodgson J in <i>Standard Chartered</i> and
Young J in <i>Southern Cross</i> are not obstacles to the application of
<i>s1318</i> in this instance. I am also of the view that although the defences
in <i>s558H </i>may give <i>some appearance </i>of a full elaboration of the
circumstances to escape liability, such appearance disappeared with the
introduction of <i>1317JA</i> which operates concurrently with <i>s1318
(s1317JA(7)).</i>
<P>

157	There is no claim for relief under <i>s1317JA. Section 1318 </i>operates
when civil proceedings are brought for a <i>breach of duty.</i> <i>Division (3)
of  Part 5.7B</i> <i>of the Corporations Law</i> imposes on a director a
<i>duty </i>to prevent insolvent trading. Although the language used in
<i>588G(2)</i> refers to a <i>contravention</i> I am of the view that language
does not detract from the interpretation I have applied which is that it is a
breach of the duty which
amounts to the contravention which entitles
proceedings under <i>s588M to </i>be commenced. I am of the view that
<i>s1318</i> applies.
<P>

158	It is therefore necessary to decide whether I should exercise my discretion
in Mr Brown's favour under <i>s1318. </i>This has been descibed as a wide
discretion<i>.  (Daniels v Anderson  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2037%20NSWLR%20438" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 37 NSWLR 438</a> at 525B)</i>
<P>

159	Since 1981 there has been  no express requirement that the director acted
<i>reasonably.  </i>The removal of this requirement serves to focus the
attention of the Court primarily on the honesty of the director.  However
honesty
alone is not sufficient to ground a proper exercise of my discretion
under <i>s1318. (Advance Bank Australia Limited &amp; Ors v FAI Insurance Ltd
&amp; Anor</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1988/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] VicRp 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%205%20ACLC%20716" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 5 ACLC 716</a> at 725 <i>per Kirby P (as he then was) (with
whom Glass JA agreed) at 746). </i>There is no suggestion that Mr Brown did not
act honestly.  I therefore find that prerequisite satisfied.
<P>

160	Although <i>reasonable </i>conduct is not an express prerequisite to
granting relief under the section I regard it as a relevant consideration in
exercising
my discretion as to whether Mr Brown ought <i>fairly </i>to be
excused from liability. A decision on this matter is reached having regard
to<i> all the circumstances of the case </i>which will include the way in which
the breach of duty occurred. (<i>Circle Petroleum (Qld) v Greenslade  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2016%20ACLC%201577" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 16
ACLC 1577</a> at 1598).</i>
<P>

161	<i>S1317JA(3)</i> refers to some specific matters to which the Court <i>is
</i>to pay regard when that section is relied upon in determining whether a
person ought fairly to be excused for a contravention. These
matters are not
exhaustive.
<P>

162	Mr Robinson emphasised the necessity for Mr Brown to rely on others with
the relevant skills to manage the financial aspects
of the Company.  He submits
that this is consistent with the acknowledgement in the <i>Corporations Law</i>
that reasonable reliance is permissible.  I agree. I regard Brown's reliance on
others in respect of the day to day management of
the Company's financial
affairs as reasonable.  
<P>

163	Mr Brown was misled by Mr and Mrs Kenna at the very least by the production
of false books and records.  It is submitted the
diversion of cash and
resources away from the Company and into the Douglas Park property must have at
least contributed to the Company's
insolvency and may have caused it.
<P>

164	It is also submitted that Mr Brown worked to the best of his abilities in
coming to grips with the financial affairs of the
Company.  He complied with a
system that had been developed over a considerable period of time that had
hitherto proved effective
in bringing matters to his attention. His trust was
misplaced in 1994 and 1995 and it is submitted that his actions were that of
an
honest person in dealing with the Company's affairs and it would be fair to
relieve him wholly or partly from liability.  
<P>

165	Mr Thomson relied upon the relevant portion of the judgment of Clarke and
Sheller JJA  in <i>Daniels v Anderson</i> at 525 in relation to the purpose of
<i>s1318</i>:
<P>

	<i>The purpose of the section is to excuse company officers from liability in
situations where it would be unjust and oppressive not
to do so, recognising
that such officers are business men and women who act in an environment
involving risk in commercial decision
making.</i>
<P>

	In reliance upon this authority he submitted that the director's duty is not
limited by the state of the director's knowledge,
experience, ignorance or
inaction.
<P>

166	Mr Thomson submitted that it would be an erroneous application of <i>s1318
</i>to relieve a director who was utterly ignorant of and completely
indifferent to the Company's financial affairs. It is suggested such
epithets
accurately describe Mr Brown.
<P>

167	Mr Thomson submits that the matters which would count strongly against
granting the relief to Mr Brown include the following:
<P>

(a)	Mr Brown has not been able to make out a defence pursuant to s588H.
<P>

(b)	Mr Brown's complete disregard of his obligations as a director to acquaint
himself with the Company's affairs in relation to
its financial management.
<P>

(c)	The fact that Mr Brown's failures as referred to in (b) allowed the
Company's business to be ruined by fraud and mismanagement
on the part of those
he left entrusted and, it is submitted wholly unchecked, to carry out the
functions.
<P>

(d)	Mr Brown's failure to intelligently enquire or ascertain the facts when
there were the clearest grounds to do so.  On this topic
Mr Thomson referred to
the question of cash receipts and Mr Brown's failure to follow his suspicions
through, his failure to address
the Company's need for additional working
capital which it is submitted he recognised in late 1994 and his failure to
clarify the
position of the building project at Douglas Park when he was aware
that subcontractors were being dragged away from other projects.
<P>

(e)	Mr Brown had available to him all the armoury of legal powers necessary to
ensure that the loss suffered by the Company was
not so suffered.  Mr Thomson
emphasised the lack of such armoury in the unsecured creditors and points to
the fact that Mr Brown
had ready access to those who could have assisted him
including Mr Brangwin or alternatively Mr Brown's son who had some accountancy
training.  He failed to seek such assistance.
<P>

159	The fact that Mr Brown has not been able to make out a defence under
<i>s588H </i>does not of itself have much bearing on the exercise of my
discretion. If Mr Brown had been able to make out his defence I would not
have
to consider exercising my discretion under <i>s1318.</i>  It is more the
circumstances of the breach of duty to which there is no successful defence to
which I must have regard.
<P>

160	I do not agree that the epithets <i>utterly ignorant </i>and <i>completely
indifferent</i> are accurate descriptions of the way in which Mr Brown<i>
</i>approached the Company's financial situation. There were matters of which
he was not ignorant and certainly there were matters to
which he was not
indifferent. His annual attendance upon Mr Brangwin and the receipt of
explanations about the company's financial
position at that time which he
regarded as <i>adequate </i>is support for that view. Additionally he gave
evidence that his son explained some aspects of the financial statements to
him. This
is not the measure of a man who is utterly ignorant or completely
indifferent.
<P>

161	Although I have found that it was reasonable for Mr Brown to rely on others
in respect of the financial management of the company
it does not follow that
it was reasonable for him not to make some enquiry in respect of the financial
affairs of the Company particularly
during 1994.  
<P>

162	Without reiterating the matters of which he was aware in late 1994 and
accepting the version of the conversation with Mrs Kenna
on 22 March 1995 that
he gave in evidence before me, I am of the view that the enquiry he did make
was very cursory indeed.  This
is so particularly having regard to the fact
that he was also aware that he had effectively been kept in the dark about
those extra
projects being taken on by the Company.  
<P>

163	It is clear that he was extremely busy but this should not have prevented
him from speaking to Mr Kenna or Mr Brangwin (even
on the telephone) about the
effect of the extra projects and/or the deposits of cash. He could have
informed Mr Brangwin that the
Company was in the habit of receiving cash
payments in the course of its business. Alternatively he could have raised the
matters
with his son and asked him to assist him in an approach to Mr Kenna or
Mr Brangwin.
<P>

164	The approach to Mr Kenna may have been less than comfortable for him but as
a director he could (either alone or with his son)
have required a proper
explanation as to the cash and the impact of the new projects. Another matter
upon which he could have required
an explanation was the Douglas Park
property.
<P>

165	Had he raised the matter of cash payments with Mr Brangwin it has to be
assumed that an enquiry would have revealed, as the
liquidator was able to
discover, that no cash payment had been deposited into the Company's bank
account between July 1992 and June
1995.  Mr Brown knew or had a reasonable
belief that cash had been paid to the company during 1994/1995. He could have
told Mr Brangwin
of his discussion with  Mr Arnold in that period whose
conversation had led him to the reasonable conclusion that he was paying cash
to the Company. 
<P>

166	Once this was discovered it would have very much depended upon the
explanation given by Mr Brangwin as to the company's affairs
as to whether the
diversion of cash and resources to the Douglas Park property could have been
uncovered and turned around in time
to salvage the solvency of the Company.
<P>

167	One matter of relevance is that Mr Brangwin had been the accountant for the
partnership and the company for about 22 years.
The evidence suggests that
prior to July 1992 cash was received and banked. It is reasonable to assume
that Mr Brangwin was aware
that the company received cash in the ordinary
course of its business.
<P>

168	It may be that Mr Brangwin had been given an explanation that there was no
cash being received by the Company after July 1992.
If that were the case then
Mr Brown's approach would have alerted Mr Brangwin to a possible problem. Mr
Brangwin was not called to
give evidence and it is therefore not possible to
know what, if anything, he was told by Mr or Mrs Kenna. However it is clear
from
Mrs Kenna's evidence at the public examination that Mr Brangwin was misled
on a number of other matters.
<P>

169	Mr Brown was in a position superior to that of the unsecured creditors so
far as the alternatives that were available to uncover
and reverse the decline
into which the Company was being led by the conduct of Mr and Mrs Kenna.
<P>

170	It has been suggested that such conduct may not have been so easy to
uncover.  However Mr Brown gave some evidence on this topic
that was very
telling.  He said he made a number of phone calls to the Company's
sub-contractors at the request of the liquidator.
He was able to find out from
those sub-contractors that they claimed they were owed money by the company
(not Mr &amp; Mrs Kenna)
in respect of the Douglas Park property.  Such an
enquiry could have been made by Mr Brown much earlier.  It is very probable
that
he would have seen these sub-contractors on the numerous jobs he was
supervising and had a good working relationship with them. There
was no
apparent impediment to him asking them about the Douglas Park property.
<P>

171	Mr Brown had been a friend and business partner of Mr Kenna  for almost 30
years. He thought he could trust him implicitly.
This trust was no doubt
misplaced in later years particularly when it is apparent that the Company's
money was being diverted for
the benefit of Mr &amp; Mrs Kenna and to the
exclusion of Mr Brown. It seems that this was made possible and perhaps easier
by the
division of duties to which the two men had become accustomed.
<P>

172	However once Mr Brown became aware that he had not been consulted in
relation to the three extra projects and their impact on
the financial position
of the Company in circumstances where he knew the Company was stretched his
inaction was in my opinion not
reasonable.
<P>

173	I am of the view that in exercising my discretion it is necessary to have
regard to Mr Brown's present circumstances in deciding
whether to excuse him
partly or wholly from liability. I raised this matter with his counsel but I am
left without any reliable evidence
as to any detail of his current personal or
financial circumstances. Additionally although further written submissions were
made
by Mr Thomson which agreed with such an approach being taken by me, Mr
Brown's counsel's further written submissions in response
made no reference to
this aspect of the matter.
<P>

174	Although there is some evidence of Mr Brown's background as a carpenter and
the fact that he is a pensioner doing part time
work for his son there is no
detail of his current assets. Mr Thomson submits that no inference favourable
to Mr Brown should be
drawn in the circumstances of his failure to give
evidence of that detail. (<i>Commercial Union Co v Ferrcom  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2022%20NSWLR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 22 NSWLR 389</a>

<P>

175	In all the circumstances of the case I am not of the view that Mr Brown
ought fairly to be excused from any liability.

<P>

perform the duties as outlined in par 28 above.
 It is also alleged by the
plaintiffs that Mrs Kenna breached that duty by the conduct alleged in par 29

between the parties about the specific nature of Mrs

179	Mr Newlinds submits that I should not find that Mrs Kenna held a position
with the company such that would attract the statutory
obligations of the

so far as to show that Mrs Kenna fell within the definition in the
<i>Corporations Law</i> to prove that she owed a fiduciary duty to the Company.
In any event he submits that the evidence discloses that Mrs Kenna did take
part in the management of the Company as provided in the definition of
<i>executive officer </i>in <i>s9 of the Corporations Law</i>.
<P>

180	Mr Newlinds submits that it was solely Mr Kenna who managed the Company and
in reality Mrs Kenna simply did as she was told
by her husband.  He submits
that in those circumstances there is an issue as to whether the relationship
gave rise to any fiduciary
obligations and if it did a question arises as to
how their scope is to be moulded according to the relationship and the facts
proved.

182	Mrs Kenna accepted in her evidence at the public examination that she
prepared the books and the financial records of the Company.
She also accepted
that for the previous thirteen years she had been carrying out the role of the
Company's <i>internal accountant</i>.  She said that she also liaised with KPMG
to assist them to prepare the Company's accounts in final form.
<P>

183	In paragraph 34 of his affidavit Mr Brown stated that from 1984 Mrs Kenna
worked as the bookkeeper, office manager and accounts
manager and assisted Mr
Kenna with all the administration tasks. He was cross examined about these
descriptions by Mr Newlinds. Mr
Brown agreed Mrs Kenna did not have any signing
rights for cheques nor did she make any decisions about how much employees were
to
be paid. He admitted that the descriptions he gave of Mrs Kenna's duties
were what he thought she did. He was not aware of any contract
of employment
for Mrs Kenna and had no involvement in the decision to employ her. He agreed
with the proposition that Mr Kenna made
the decisions and Mrs Kenna carried
them out.
<P>

184	Mrs Diane Rowlands who was employed by the Company between November 1993
and June 1995 gave evidence that she performed clerical
duties under Mrs
Kenna's supervision.  Mrs Rowlands agreed with Mr Newlind's descriptions of Mr
Kenna as the boss and that he ran
the show<i>.  </i>She observed occasions when
Mr Kenna told Mrs Kenna what to do but never observed Mrs Kenna telling Mr
Kenna what to do. She agreed
with the suggestion that it was Mr Kenna who wore
the pants and made the major decisions within the office<i>.</i>
<P>

185	Mr Thomson submits that the evidence supports a finding that Mr Kenna did
make the major decisions but Mrs Kenna in a very real
sense occupied an
executive office and carried out executive functions, in effect, as Mr Kenna's
second-in-charge. It is submitted
that she was, as Mr Brown described her, the
office manager and held a senior position in the day to day management of the
company's
affairs.
<P>

186	Mr Newlinds submits that the evidence does not support such a finding and
that Mrs Kenna's position was that of a senior member
of the secretarial staff
as receptionist/bookkeeper. So far as her capacity to instruct others was
concerned Mr Newlinds submitted
that it was no different from that of a senior
apprentice on a factory floor instructing the junior apprentice. He submitted
that
Mr Thomson's submission that Mrs Kenna was an executive officer was a
meaningless proposition and made a similar submission in relation
to his own
client's adoption of the description of herself as the internal accountant of
the Company.  In support he pointed to the
fact that Mrs Kenna only maintained
secondary books and records and the final records were prepared by the external
accountant.
<P>

187	Mr Newlinds submitted further that the nature of Mrs Kenna's duties was
consistent with those of an office girl, bookkeeper
and receptionist. He
pointed to the absence of any suggestion that she hired potential staff or had
the ability to make decisions.
As to the description of instructing office
staff he pointed to the absence of any detail as to precisely what was
taught.
<P>

188	I am of the view that Mr Newlinds interpretation of Mrs Kenna's duties
ignores some important features which demonstrate that
her role was much more
significant than that of a bookkeeper, receptionist or as he put it, an office
girl. Mrs Kenna prepared and
arranged colour schemes for the spec homes. She
checked those homes and liaised with sub-contractors in relation to them. On
occasions
she met with the sub-contractors. She interviewed potential staff no
doubt to make decisions as to whether they would be suitable
employees.  Even
if the final decision on this matter was made by Mr Kenna her role in this
aspect of the company's affairs could
hardly be said to be that of an office
girl although there were duties within her range of duties that were reasonably
menial. It
seems that Mrs Kenna was expected to be multi-skilled.
<P>

189	Mrs Kenna was employed for 13 years and was entrusted with responsibilities
described above and in her evidence which I regard
as significant employment
responsibilities.  Mrs Kenna had access to all the Company's business records
and was the author of the
primary records and working papers for the
accountant. She said that the financial records and the supervision of those
records were
all under the control of herself and her husband.  Payments of
cash were made to her and she instructed the staff what to do with
such
payments in her absence. She no doubt acted as the Company's agent in meeting
with the sub-contractors and in checking the spec
homes. 
<P>

190	I am satisfied that Mrs Kenna was involved with Mr Kenna in the management
of the Company and second-in-charge would not be
an unreasonable description of
her.
<P>

	<u>Mrs Kenna's role in the improvement of Douglas Park and Thirroul</u>
<P>

191	Mrs Kenna gave evidence at the public examination that in 1994 she was
aware that certain payments were made by the Company
on her husband's behalf
and on her behalf for the construction costs of her home at Douglas Park.  She
understood that those payments
were for the personal benefit of herself and her
husband.  She said in her evidence that she was directed to make those payments
from the Company's account by Mr Kenna.
<P>

192	Although Mrs Kenna claimed initially that she intended to repay the monies
to the company she then said that she did not know
whether she intended to
repay the money and finally admitted that she had no plans to repay the money.
She said that she was aware
that the payments made by the Company in relation
to the Douglas Park property should have been recorded in the records of the
Company
and were not so recorded.  She admitted that she did not tell the
external accountant of the payments that had been made in relation
to the
Douglas Park property which were not recorded in the Company's records.
<P>

193	Mrs Kenna admitted that there were transactions recorded in the Company
records in which the payments made by the Company for
the work on the Douglas
Park property were recorded as payments made by the Company in respect of other
jobs.  She admitted making
false entries in the records but said she did so at
the direction of her husband because she always just did what he said.
<P>

194	On this evidence alone Mrs Kenna's involvement in diverting the Company's
funds to her own benefit and that of her husband is
beyond any doubt at all. Mr
Newlinds submits that I should assess this evidence with particular regard to
Mrs Kenna's statement that
she did as she was told by her husband. I have
assessed the evidence with regard to that matter.  It has never been suggested
to
me that Mrs Kenna was not a willing participant in this conduct nor was
there any suggestion of any threat. It was simply that she
always did as her
husband asked.
<P>

195	The liquidator's evidence in relation to the Thirroul property which was
not challenged in cross examination by Mr Newlinds.
is helpfully summarised in
document D1 within Exhibit B and from page 60 to 65 of his affidavit of 30 July
1997. Goods and services
were supplied for the living area such as the lounge
room, dining room and hallway of the Thirroul property. By comparison with the
documents in D2 to D4 in Exhibit B it is apparent that some of the goods and
services supplied to the Thirroul property were allocated
to other clients and
addresses. This evidence demonstrates that during Mrs Kenna's period of
employment specifically the  period
31/12/89 to 31/12/93 $40,512 of the
Company's funds were expended on improvements to the Thirroul property.
<P>

196	I am satisfied that Mrs Kenna was a willing participant in the payments of
Company funds to the various contractors for the
improvement of the Douglas
Park and Thirroul properties.
<P>

	<u>The alleged misappropriation of cash</u>
<P>

197	In the public examination Mrs Kenna admitted that from time to time the
Company received cash and she purposely did not include
the receipts in the
Company's records.  She said she did this at her husband's direction.  She
admitted that she realised that her
failure to record it was a dishonest act.
She said that she had no choice.  However she also said that her husband did
not threaten
her. Her explanation was that <i>there was only one boss in our
house and that was my husband and I did what he said.</i>
<P>

198	The cash was given to Mr Kenna and if Mrs Kenna was not present on the
occasion when cash was paid she had instructed the staff
to place it in a
drawer in the office or give it to Mr Kenna. Mr Newlinds submits that there is
no evidence to suggest that Mrs Kenna
benefited directly from the cash<i>.
</i>Mr Thomson submits that the fact that the cash was given to Mr Kenna does
not mean that Mrs Kenna did not obtain a benefit from it
either directly or
indirectly.  It is not surprising that if Mr Kenna wore the pants in the
relationship, to use Mr Newlinds expression,
that at first instance the cash
would go to him.
<P>

199	There is some evidence that Mr &amp; Mrs Kenna had recently come to some
arrangement about the sharing of their finances and
assets. In evidence in the
public examination Mrs Kenna said that prior to the purchase of the Douglas
Park property she and Mr Kenna
had separate bank accounts. 
<P>

200	When the Douglas Park property was purchased Mr &amp; Mrs Kenna opened a
joint account. They had a home loan account into which
they each paid money.
Mrs Kenna said; <i>It was worked out that I owed one third and Lance owed two
thirds of the loan so <b>we decided </b>upon an amount each that we would put
into that account to pay the monthly home loan repayment plus..rates,
electricity, everything
else relating to the two properties.</i>
<P>

201	Mrs Kenna also gave evidence  that in May 1993 Mr Kenna transferred an half
interest in the Thirroul property to her because
they <i>had been married for a
long time, it was time we.. shared our property. </i>Of this transfer<i>
</i>Mrs Kenna said <i>I nagged him for years. I thought it was only fair and
finally he agreed.</i>  Mrs Kenna did not agree that this was somewhat
inconsistent with the picture painted of a woman who had no choice but to do as
she
was told. That may or may not be so however it certainly suggests that
there was a sharing of property and assets on what Mrs Kenna
thought was a
<i>fair </i>basis.
<P>

202	In all the circumstances I am satisfied that it is probable that the cash
that was given to Mr Kenna benefited Mrs Kenna by
reason of these arrangements.
The plaintiffs have proved their case in this regard on the balance of
probabilities and it was not
their task to have to exclude every reasonable
hypothesis in relation to the use of the money. <i>(State Rail Authority of New
South  Wales v Earthline Constructions Pty Ltd (In liq) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] HCA 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2073%20ALJR%20306" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 73 ALJR 306</a>
at318 par 49)</i>
<P>

	<u>The Water Board cheques</u>
<P>

203	It is not necessary for me to deal with this matter because any reliance
placed upon the cheques to prove cash payments to Mr
and Mrs Kenna was
abandoned after Mrs Rowlands gave evidence that she understood it was for cash
to be paid to employees who worked
on the weekend. The plaintiffs relied upon
the false entries only in so far as they were misleading to the accountants and
in respect
of the presumption of insolvency.
<P>

	<u>Mrs Kenna's duty</u>
<P>

204	I am satisfied on the evidence that it was implicit in Mrs Kenna's
employment that she had undertaken to act in the Company's
best interests and
that she owed to the Company a fiduciary duty to;
<P>

&#183;	ensure that proper records of all the Company's financial dealings were
maintained;
<P>

&#183;	ensure that no cheque was drawn on the Company's bank account except for
a purpose of the Company;
<P>

&#183;	disclose to the Company's external accountants all records and
information  necessary to enable the formation of a true view
of the affairs of
the Company.
<P>

205	The other two duties alleged by the plaintiffs were firstly a duty to
inform the Company if any of its monies had been or might
in the future be
misapplied and secondly to disclose to the Company any misconduct of any
director of the Company.
<P>

206	Mrs Kenna had been placed in a very special situation as it related to Mr
Brown and the company generally. She was the internal
accountant and I am of
the view that Mrs Kenna did owe a duty to the Company to inform it when its
monies had been misapplied. I
am not satisfied that I should mould the duty in
the circumstances of the facts that have been proved to include a duty to
inform
the company about what <i>might happen.</i>
<P>

207	As it happens if Mrs Kenna had complied with this duty it would have
resulted in the Company being informed of Mr Kenna's misconduct.
Realistically
Mr Brown would have been informed as Mr Kenna was well aware of his conduct.
However I am not satisfied that such a
broad duty requiring Mrs Kenna to report
<i>any misconduct </i>is appropriate.
<P>

208	I am also satisfied that Mrs Kenna breached her fiduciary duty in that
she;
<P>

&#183;	made false entries in the Company's records as demonstrated particularly
by her own admissions in the public examination
which included false entries in
relation to the Douglas Park property and a failure to record the receipt of
cash;
<P>

&#183;	prepared cheques and obtained Mr Kenna's signature on them which were
payable to contractors for the construction of her
home at Douglas Park and
knew that it was not for the Company's benefit;
<P>

&#183;	failed to tell the external accountants of these matters; and
<P>

&#183;	failed to report to the Company that its monies had been misapplied.
<P>

	<b>Claim against Mr  &amp; Mrs Kenna</b>
<P>

209	The plaintiffs submit that Mr &amp; Mrs Kenna owed fiduciary and statutory
duties to the Company to act honestly, not to gain
an advantage for themselves
and not to cause detriment to the company.<i>(Furs Ltd v Tomkies  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%20154%20CLR%20583" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 154 CLR

<P>

210	Mr Thomson also made a submission that both Mr &amp; Mrs Kenna's conduct

objected to these submissions on the basis that such a case was not pleaded
against Mrs Kenna.
<P>

211	It seems to me that the case was pleaded in paragraph 13  to 13 C of the
Further Amended Statement of Claim notwithstanding
Mr Newlinds submission that
the duties relied upon by the plaintiffs<b> </b>were limited to those pleaded
in par 4 of the pleading.
<P>

212	It is submitted that the conduct necessarily falls short of the standard
required. It is submitted that as recipients of a benefit
from their dishonest
conduct they are liable to account to the Company in respect of the misuse of
the Company's funds in the amount
of $131,390 paid in respect of work on the
Douglas Park property, $40,500 in respect of the Thirroul property  and the
further amounts
in respect of cash payments made by Mr Poulton of $6,0000 and
by Mr Arnold of $51,360. <i>(Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1995/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] UKPC 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%202%20AC%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 2 AC
378)</a></i>
<P>

213	Mr Kenna did not appear and did not give any evidence. Mrs Kenna did not
give any evidence.  In those circumstances I am entitled
to and do assume that
they could not have given any evidence that was favourable to them on this
aspect of the plaintiffs' case against
them.
<P>

214	The plaintiffs tendered Mr Kenna's affidavit sworn on 3 October 1995 which
was in response to an order under <i>s597A of the Corporations Law.</i> Mr
Kenna's  statements in that affidavit include the following;
<P>

	(i)	In relation to the Douglas Park property;
<P>

	....<i>any payments made by the company in respect of improvements made on
that property were paid in lieu of entitlements of myself as a
director and
employee and shareholder of the company and I say that I am unaware of the
amounts or dates of any such payments but
say that all such details are within
the knowledge of the liquidator and are contained within the records held by
the liquidator
in respect of the company.</i>
<P>

	<i>I cannot recall any services being provided by the Company in respect of
the construction or the improvements on the (Douglas Park
property). The
property was built by myself and my sons.</i>
<P>

	<i>I am unable to provide an itemisation of the services or goods provided in
respect of the property..as all such records of the Company
are held by the
liquidator and are within his knowledge. </i>
<P>

	In respect of receipts of cash;
<P>

	<i>During the period 1 January 1990 to date both myself and the other director
of the Company from time to time received cash payments
on behalf of the
Company. I am unable to recall specific instances , circumstances, dates,
amounts or parties in respect of such
payments. I say that on such occasions
such cash payments were received and divided equally between the directors of
the Company.</i>
<P>

215	Mr Brown denies receiving the half share of the cash as claimed by Mr Kenna
in this affidavit and there is no claim made against
him in respect of the
allegation made by Mr Kenna.
<P>

216	Mr Newlinds submitted that I would not be satisfied on the evidence before
me that Mr Poulton paid an amount of $6,000 cash
to the Company. It is true
that there was no direct evidence from Mr Poulton  but the evidence of the
liquidator in respect of this
payment by Mr Poulton was not challenged.  In the
circumstances I am satisfied that Mr Poulton did make the payment in cash and
that
it was, according to Mrs Kenna's admitted practice, given to Mr Kenna.
<P>

217	The Company's records demonstrate that Mr Kenna's statements in his s597A
affidavit in respect of the Douglas Park property
cannot be accepted.  The
liquidator's analysis of the Company's records referred to above leads me to
the conclusion that $131,000
was paid out of the Company funds to pay for the
Douglas Park property as was $40,500 for the Thirroul property . I am also
satisfied
that Mr and Mrs Kenna obtained the benefit of the cash payments made
by Mr Poulton and Mr Arnold. 
<P>

218	I am satisfied that both Mr and Mrs Kenna owed a duty to the Company to act
honestly and not to gain an advantage for themselves.
 I am also satisfied they
breached that duty and gained advantages for themselves from the improvements
to the two properties and
the use of the cash payments.
<P>

	<b>Uplift claim</b>
<P>

219	A rather novel approach was adopted by Mr Thomson in his pleading to claim
an additional unspecified amount on the basis that
<i>the quantum of cash taken
by the first and second defendants was substantial.</i>   It is alleged that by
the very nature of the Company's business there was a likelihood of it
receiving cash.  Other allegations
include the fact that Mr and Mrs Kenna
failed to produce the second cash receipts book to the liquidator and that
their expenditure
in addition to ordinary living expenses was well beyond any
amounts paid lawfully to them by the Company without an apparent source
of any
other funds.  In these circumstances it is submitted that a finding should be
made that cash additional to that which has
been proved was taken from the
Company's funds. 
<P>

220	There is no doubt in my mind that this case has not been proved.  Although
it was submitted that I could give the plaintiff
some uplift in this portion of
its claim I was referred to no authority that would entitle me to do so.
Notwithstanding the absence
of such an authority it seems to me at the very
least there had to be cogent evidence before I could embark upon the journey to
such
a finding.  The plaintiffs have not proved their case in this regard.
<P>

	<b>Causation</b>
<P>

221	It is submitted by Mr Newlinds that the conduct of Mrs Kenna has not caused
the Company any loss or damage.  I disagree.
<P>

222	It is submitted that if Mrs Kenna had told Mr Brown about Mr Kenna's
activities Mr Brown would have left matters up to Mr Kenna.
 It seems to me
that the evidence does not support such a submission  When Mr Brown was
informed third hand about a problem with
cash in 1990 he was willing to
confront Mr Kenna about it.  Certainly that confrontation was in the
circumstances perhaps less than
adequate but he was at least willing to raise
the matter.  Had he been informed first hand by an employee of the Company that
money
was being taken from the funds of the Company it seems to me on the
evidence of those previous approaches to Mr Kenna that it is
more probable than
not that Mr Brown would not simply have left it to Mr Kenna and would have
rectified the problem.
<P>

223	A similar submission was made in respect of the notification to the
accountant and his consequent duty  to inform only the directors
and
shareholders. Because of the finding I have made in respect to Mr Brown
rectifying the problem this submission must also fail.

<P>

224	In any event Mrs Kenna's conduct in breach of her duties enabled Mr Kenna
to extract cash from the Company's funds; facilitated
the payments from the
Company's funds for improvements to the Douglas Park and Thirroul properties;
enabled those payments to remain
undetected and caused loss to the Company. 
<P>

<b>Conclusion </b>
<P>

224	I will make the declarations and orders in par 30 of the Further Amended
Statement of Claim. However I have considered all the
circumstances of this
case and I am satisfied that it is an appropriate case in which to construe a
trust in aid of Mr and Mrs Kenna's
obligations to account to the company.
(<i>Giumelli v Giumelli <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/10.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] HCA 10</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2073%20ALJR%20547" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 73 ALJR 547)</a></i> I am also satisfied that in all
the circumstances such trust should be construed in the terms of par 30.2C of
the Further Amended
Statement of Claim. 
<P>

225	I have found that the first and third defendants have contravened s588G of
the Corporations Law and will make the consequential
declarations and orders in
respect of the amount $1,286,923. I am satisfied that the plaintiff has proved
the amounts in the document
entitled Schedule of Payment (less $5,234 which was
abandoned) making a total of $229,250. I am also satisfied that the Company is
entitled to interest.
<P>

226	I will stand the matter over to Friday 4 June 1999 at 9.30 am for the
parties to bring in Short Minutes of Order reflecting
these findings at which
time I will hear any application in respect of costs.
