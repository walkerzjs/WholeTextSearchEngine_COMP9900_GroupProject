FRIDAY 26 NOVEMBER 1999
<P>

<center><b>REGINA v. FRANK PETER PETRINOVIC</b>
<P>

<b>SENTENCE</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  On 19 July 1999, the prisoner pleaded guilty before
me to one count of the murder of Ian Hagarty at Lurnea on 26
October 1997.  It
was common ground that that count embraced a crime of attempted robbery being
armed with a dangerous weapon.
<P>

2  	The Crown accepted that the plea was made on the basis of felony
murder as is referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.18</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a> and conceded that on
the facts it did not seek to rely on any of the intentional states necessary
for murder referred to in that
section.
<P>

3  	On the hearing of the plea, I was provided by consent with the
following statement of facts:-
<P>

"At about 5.30 pm on Sunday 26 October 1997, the prisoner, Frank Petrinovic,
and a co-offender, Mandie Jancek, drove to the vicinity
of the Liquorland
Bottle Shop, located at the corner of Hill Road and Reilly Street, Lurnea.
Both the prisoner and Jancek travelled
there in vehicle MOW-739, a 1983 Holden
Commodore sedan owned by the prisoner.
<P>

The prisoner got out of the vehicle in Reilly Street.  He put on a black
balaclava and surgical gloves and armed himself with a
loaded .32 calibre
Argentina brand revolver.  At the time he was also carrying a red plastic Grace
Bros. shopping bag.
<P>

The prisoner walked into the Liquorland Bottle Shop through the Reilly Street
entrance.  He walked towards the cash register and
confronted the two employees
on duty, Ian Hagarty and Troy Stephens.
<P>

The prisoner ordered the two employees to the ground.  Both complied.  The
prisoner stood over both employees and pointed the loaded
revolver in their
direction.  The prisoner threw the Grace Bros. bag he was carrying behind the
counter and said, 'fill up the bag'.
 Mr. Hagarty stood up and said, 'alright
mate, I'll do it'.
<P>

At that point a struggle started between the prisoner and Mr. Hagarty.  During
the struggle, two shots were discharged from the
revolver by the prisoner.  One
of the bullets struck Mr. Hagarty in the right side of the neck.  The bullet
partially severed the
left pulmonary artery of the left lung and travelled
through the left posterior rib cage.  In the opinion of the forensic
pathologist
who carried out the post-mortem examination on Mr. Hagarty, the
death of Mr. Hagarty was caused by this gun shot wound.  The second
bullet did
not enter Mr. Hagarty's body.  It created a combined entry/exit wound.
<P>

Mr. Hagarty continued to struggle with the prisoner after the shots were fired,
eventually taking the revolver off the prisoner
and staggering away.  He later
collapsed in the driveway area.
<P>

Around this time, a number of the customers in the shop came to the aid of Mr.
Hagarty.  The prisoner was restrained by the customers
in the driveway area.
<P>

At that point the co-offender Jancek entered the shop on foot and attempted to
pull away the customers who were restraining the
prisoner.  She was
unsuccessful and she left the shop.  Jancek then returned a short time later
driving vehicle MOW-739.  She drove
the vehicle into the bottle shop, and drove
at the prisoner and the customers, narrowly missing a number of people.
<P>

This resulted in the prisoner breaking free of the customers for a short time.
The prisoner attempted to get into the vehicle driven
by Jancek, but was unable
to do so.  The prisoner then picked up a house brick and threatened the
witnesses who were trying to detain
him.
<P>

The prisoner ran out onto the footpath of Reilly Street where he was again
restrained by customers until police arrived.  The prisoner
was taken into
custody by police, together with the co-offender Jancek who was restrained by
witnesses in the motor vehicle she was
driving.
<P>

Mr. Hagarty was taken by ambulance to Liverpool Hospital, but soon after died
of his injuries.
<P>

Located at the scene was the loaded revolver used by the prisoner, the
balaclava worn by the prisoner which was removed by one of
the witnesses who
tried to detain him, surgical gloves worn by the prisoner, and the Grace Bros.
shopping bag.
<P>

A search was made of the vehicle owned by the prisoner.  Located in the vehicle
was a radio scanner which was set on the police
channel for the Liverpool area,
and a box of surgical gloves.
<P>

The prisoner was taken by police to Liverpool Police Station.  Later he was
taken to Liverpool Hospital where he was treated for
injuries sustained by him
at the scene.  The prisoner was later returned to Liverpool Police Station
where he was interviewed.  The
prisoner stated that he did not wish to comment
about what had occurred."
<P>

4  	The detail of that statement was not in contest before me and I
was provided with statements from the various witnesses to support
it.  I
accept that statement as setting out the immediate factual context of the
offence.
<P>

5  	Subsequent to the entry of the plea, the sentencing proceedings
were stood over to enable preparation of appropriate material
by the Crown and
preparation of relevant written submissions.  When the matter came back before
me, in addition to the two victim
impact statements, which were provided to me
during the plea and which I treated in accordance with s.23C of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal
Procedure Act 1986</a> and the principles set out in <b>Regina v. Previtera</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2094%20A%20Crim%20R%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 94 A. Crim. R. 76</a>, I was provided with two documents summarising the
prisoner's appalling prior criminal record and also his gaol movements.  Those
documents are annexed to this judgment.  They refer to the numerous previous
armed robbery and other serious offences committed while
the prisoner was on
parole or while an escapee.  The present offence was committed some four and a
half months after the prisoner's
release from custody and whilst he was on
parole.
<P>

6  	Although the documentation including the document provided to me
setting out in extenso the prisoner's prior record refers to
various different
birth dates, I have been informed that the prisoner was born on 15 March 1960
and is thus presently 39 years old
and will proceed on that basis.
<P>

7  	I have been further informed that prior to his entry into an
adult gaol at the age of 18, the prisoner had spent a considerable
period of
his life from the age of 10 onwards in institutions.
<P>

8  	The annexed document headed "Gaol movements" calculates the
prisoner's total time in custody not including the time in juvenile
detention
centres or institutions and their equivalents, as 17 years, 18 days, ie., the
prisoner has been in gaol for almost all
of his adult life and in institutions
for the greater part of his life.  His time at liberty has been almost entirely
as an escapee
or whilst on parole.
<P>

9  	In addition to the material with which I was provided concerning
the prisoner's prior record, I was referred to the decision
of the Court of
Criminal Appeal of 18 September 1990 in respect of three applications by him
for leave to appeal against sentence,
which applications were refused.  In the
judgment is set out at some length and in some detail the circumstances of the
12 offences
of armed robbery, one offence of larceny of a motor vehicle, two
offences of escape lawful custody, two of assaulting police in the
execution of
their duty, in respect of which the prisoner had been sentenced to a total head
sentence of 14 years and a total non-parole
period which expired only shortly
prior to the commission of the present offence.
<P>

10  	Although the prisoner pleaded guilty and is therefore entitled
to the benefit of s.439 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>, that plea was entered but a week
before trial in circumstances in which the prisoner was arrested at the scene
of the crime which
was witnessed by numerous persons, immediately after its
commission.  The case against him, in those circumstances, was entirely
overwhelming.  However, the Crown had sought to proceed on the basis the
prisoner had an intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily
harm or was
recklessly indifferent to human life up until shortly before the plea.
<P>

11  	As soon as the Crown indicated its willingness to rely on felony
murder to the exclusion of any intentional basis for the killing,
the plea was
offered.  It is thus of significance as negating a deliberate killing and some,
but very limited significance as reflecting
in itself an element of contrition
or remorse.  Nonetheless, the trial itself would have involved some weeks of
court time and the
attendance of numerous witnesses had it proceeded.  In that
sense, there has been a saving to the community which at least reflects
on the
prisoner's part some consciousness for others from which he might benefit by
way of showing some prospect of conformity with
the requirements of society.
<P>

12  	The prisoner gave evidence on his own behalf during which he
expressed sorrow and contrition.  I have no doubt that his expression
of that
before me in the witness box was genuinely felt.  It accords with what he said
to Dr. Westmore whose report of 19 August
1999 was in evidence and with the
observations of Sue Jefferies, Clinical Nurse Consultant and Rhonda Danylenko,
Department of Community
Services, AOD Worker, both from the Corrections Health
Service in their report dated 30 July 1999.  I accept from that evidence rather
than the plea that he has some degree of remorse for what he has done and some
sorrow for the harm that he has caused.
<P>

13  	I turn to the role in this offence of the prisoner's use of and
addiction to drugs and his previous offences.
<P>

14  	The reports to which I have referred and the prisoner's own
evidence disclose that he had first started using heroin at the
age of 18 at
the time of his first gaol sentence.  He has apparently been addicted to heroin
or using methadone, except for some
intervals whilst in gaol, over a period of
20 years.  His evidence, which was in this regard corroborated by the
observations of
the authors of the Corrections Health Service report was, that
at the time of his release from custody he had been advised to maintain
a
dosage of 80 mgs of methadone (having been maintaining a dosage of 50 mgs in
gaol) but had, contrary to advice, restricted his
dosage to 40 mgs, asserting
an attempt to fight his addiction, but notwithstanding the advice he had
received from AOD workers that
a return to heroin use would mean a return to
gaol and the provision to him of assistance by way of professional support and
counselling,
found himself unable to cope, returned to heroin and to his course
of violent criminality.
<P>

15  	The prisoner had used heroin three times on the day of the
offence, on the last occasion about 15 minutes before going to Liquorland
and
had used that day a total of a gram to a gram and a half of heroin.  In
addition, he had told Ms. Jefferies and Ms. Danylenko,
Dr. Westmore and
Professor Starmer, with whose report as to the effects of the drugs I was also
provided, that he had used about
100 to 120 milligrams of methadone syrup, had
taken two Rohypnols and had drunk about half a bottle of Bourbon.  The effects
of these,
according to Professor Starmer, would have been such that it was
likely that his ability for clear logical reasoning would have been
greatly
reduced and his appreciation of the possible consequences of his actions also
reduced.  Professor Starmer stated that all
those drugs have central nervous
system depressant activity and therefore the cognitive and information
processing functions would
be expected to have been impaired.
<P>

16  	Although on an issue of criminal liability intoxication might go
to negate the formation of a specific criminal intent, in
sentencing the
question of whether it is a mitigating or aggravating feature depends upon the
circumstances (see <b>Regina v. Coleman</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2047%20A%20Crim%20R%20306" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 47 A. Crim. R. 306</a> at
327).
<P>

17  	It is quite apparent that this offence was committed whilst
under the influence of drugs in order to obtain money for drugs.
 It was
committed as the culmination of a long history of violent crime committed in
the context of drug involvement just as had
been the offences dealt with by
this court on the applications for leave to appeal against sentence to which I
have referred (see
<b>Regina v. Petrinovic</b> (CCA, unreported 18 September
1990).  Hunt, J. (as he then was), with whom Wood, J. (as he then was) and
McInerney, J. agreed, said,
at p.9:-
<P>

"The citizens of this community are sick and tired of armed robberies conducted
by criminals in order to feed their drug habits.
 The cost of the precautions
which must be taken by banks and by other businesses dealing with cash is
enormous, and that cost has
necessarily been passed on to the whole community.
More seriously, the violence so often involved and the fear inevitably
engendered
in staffs (sic) and in customers alike has aggravated the
epidemic-like proportions of this crime wave engulfing the community. 
So far
as I am concerned, this court will continue to support judges who recognise
these serious crimes and who impose heavy sentences
for them.  The community
expects it of the courts, and it is bitterly disappointed when undue leniency
is shown by the courts because
some thug cries that he has had an unhappy
upbringing and promises that he will get rid of his drug habit, as has this
applicant."
<P>

18  	Notwithstanding that the Crown did not seek to show that the
prisoner deliberately became intoxicated to facilitate the commission
of the
offence, nonetheless I see no basis on which his crime is mitigated by the
effects of the drugs on him.  Nor do I see any
basis on which his long term
drug addiction could be regarded as mitigatory where, whenever he has been at
liberty, in order to feed
that addiction, he has resorted again and again to
crimes of deliberately terrorising others, the appalling consequences of which,
even if nothing went wrong, were likely to involve permanent effects on the
victims.  Importantly as here, such crimes in themselves,
even if not committed
in circumstances of drug intoxication, have the all too great potential to
result in someone's death.  Their
fatal potential is reflected in the retention
of the felony murder provision in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.18</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>.  The whole purpose of
the conduct involved in the offence of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon is
to pose a real threat of death
to compel victims to hand over property.  Where
that death has been so caused there is little room to find the offence is any
less
culpable and good reason to consider it as at least as culpable as murder
committed intentionally.
<P>

19  	Having regard to these considerations and to the matters
referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal in <b>Regina v. Henry &amp; Ors</b>
 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/111.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCCA 111</a> by the Chief Justice at 194 and 202, by Wood, CJ. at CL. at
273 and Simpson, J. at 344, I see no basis on which the prisoner's general
involvement with drugs or his intoxication on this occasion should in the
circumstances of this case be treated as mitigatory.  They
certainly do not
render the objective circumstances of this offence less culpable.
<P>

20  	The Crown submitted that the case called for the imposition of
the maximum penalty. 
<P>

21  	The statutory scheme prescribing the maximum penalty has become
complex.  By virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s19a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.19A</a>, the maximum penalty for the crime of murder is
penal servitude for life.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s19a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 19A(2)</a> provides that a person sentenced to
penal servitude for life is to serve that sentence for the term of the person's
natural life.
 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/index.html#p11" class="autolink_findacts">Part 11</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act 1989</a> does not apply <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s.13(c))</a> so
that the provision under that Part of minimum and additional terms is
unavailable.  Section 19A(3) preserves the operation of
s.442 which authorises
the passing of a lesser sentence than a statutory maximum.
<P>

22  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s431a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 431A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> provides that a person is not
liable to the punishment of penal servitude for life for any offence except for
the offences of murder
or certain offences under the Drugs Misuse and
Trafficking Act 1985.  By s.431<b>A</b>(3) it is provided that where no penalty
is otherwise provided for an offence that was formerly punishable by penal
servitude for
life, that offence is now to be punishable by penal servitude for
25 years.  The section also refers to amendments made by the Crimes
(Life
Sentences) Amendment Act 1989 altering penalties for offences under the Act
from penal servitude for life to penal servitude
for 25 years.
<P>

23  	In the event that a trial judge does not pass a sentence of life
imprisonment for murder, the maximum sentence that might be
passed in the
exercise of discretion is at large and is not restricted by the greatest
maximum now prescribed for other offences
of 25 years. 
<P>

24  	The offence of attempted armed robbery being armed with a
dangerous weapon, the foundational felony for the murder felony here
is the
aggravated form of the offence provided for by s.97 and is punishable by penal
servitude for 25 years.  
<P>

25  	At the time of the commission of the present offence s.431B,
which came into operation on 30 June 1996, applied.  Section 431B,
the history
and nature of which is reviewed by the New South Wales Law Reform Commission in
"Sentencing" Report 79, provides for
the mandatory life sentence to be passed
by the court on a person convicted of murder if the court "is satisfied that
<b>the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme</b>
that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection
and deterrence can <b>only</b> be met through the imposition of that sentence"
(emphasis added).  Section 431B(3) provides that nothing in s.431B(1) affects
s.442,
apparently preserving the discretion.  But in the circumstances referred
to in s.431B(1), there is no discretion but to impose the
life sentence when
one has regard to the language of the provision.  The criteria appearing in
s.431B(1) are those to which regard
must be paid not whether the offence was in
"the worst class of case" for which maximum penalties were reserved at common
law (<b>Ibbs v. The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20163%20CLR%20447" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 163 CLR 447).</a>  The statutory criteria in
s.431B were developed in the light of previous judicial pronouncements.
<P>

26  	Prior to the enactment of s.431B and the provision of statutory
criteria, the relevant test for the identification of a crime
warranty the
imposition of a life sentence under s.19A was expressed in <b>Regina v.
Twala</b> (CCA, unreported 4 November 1994) in the judgment of Badgery-Parker,
J. at 7:-
<P>

"It must be possible to point to particular features which are of very great
heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the
absence of facts
mitigating the seriousness of the crime (as distinct from subjective features
mitigating the penalty to be imposed)."
<P>

27  	In <b>Regina v. Garforth</b> (CCA, unreported 31 March 1994), it
was submitted that even absent continuing dangerousness as referred to in
<b>The Queen v. Veen</b> <b>(No. 1)</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1979/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1979] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%20143%20CLR%20458" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 143 CLR 458</a>, and where there may
be prospects of rehabilitation, nevertheless, a life sentence can be
appropriate and in that regard the court
referred to:-
<P>

"... those cases where the level of culpability was so extreme that the
community interest in retribution and punishment can only
be met through the
imposition of the maximum penalty."
<P>

28  	In the Second Reading Speech on the Crimes Amendment (Mandatory
Life Sentences) Bill in 1995, the Attorney-General referred
to that statement
and described the provision as requiring the imposition of a sentence of penal
servitude for life if the court
is satisfied that the level of culpability "in
the commission of the offence" is so extreme that the community interest in
retribution,
punishment, community protection and deterrence can be met "only"
through the imposition of that sentence.  Otherwise he said s.442
provided for
the exercise of a discretion to impose less than a life sentence.  The
Attorney-General and the drafting of the provision
appear to have envisaged
that it is the form the murder takes (ie., its factual circumstances) which is
relevant.  The Attorney-General
said:-
<P>

"It is appropriate to observe here that the offence of murder takes many and
varied forms.  It is difficult, if not impossible,
to foresee every factual
circumstance capable of constituting a murder which, on its face, demonstrates
an extreme degree of criminality.
 We are not so prescient that we can
confidently assert that there will never come a time when such a crime calls
for something less
than life imprisonment.  It may well do so when the offender
is a juvenile.  For this reason the discretion to impose less than life
remains, although it is a discretion which cannot be lightly exercised in the
face of the principle expressed in the Bill."
<P>

29  	He had already said that the provision "will mandate a life
sentence for those offences to which the legislation applies and
leave the
community in no doubt of this Government's intention to remain tough on
crime".
<P>

30  	When the successor to the Bill as originally introduced came
before the Legislative Council on 17 April 1996, the Attorney-General
reiterated his earlier observations, but added in the light of the report of
the standing Committee on Law and Justice, a reference
to an exemption for
juveniles and a greater clarity to the role to be performed by s.442:-
<P>

"Section 442 allows a sentencing judge to impose less than a life sentence in
the exercise of his or her discretion.
<P>

The preservation of that discretion does no more than recognise the possibility
that a murder, which, on its face, demonstrates
an extreme degree of
criminality, may nevertheless call for something less than life imprisonment.
For this reason the discretion
to impose less than life remains ..."
<P>

31  	The provision plainly is intended to alter the common law
applicable to sentencing for crimes for which a mere maximum is prescribed
by
the legislature.
<P>

32  	Although the imposition of the sentence is described as lying in
discretion, s.431B(1) on its face requires the imposition
of the sentence in
the event that the court is satisfied of the level of culpability therein
expressed.
<P>

33  	Considering what was said by the Attorney-General and the
language used in s.431B(1), it appears that the section is meant
to apply to
the culpability involved in the commission of the crimes and that is not to be
limited as defined merely by the immediate
factual circumstances.
<P>

34  	Even as to those, there is some doubt as to whether the relevant
test requires the culpability of the factual circumstances
of the individual
offence, standing alone, to justify the imposition of penal servitude for life
(see <b>Regina v. Street</b> (CCA, unreported 17 December 1996)).  It is not
necessary to resolve that matter here.
<P>

35  	To ascertain the relevant culpability, in my view regard must be
had to the criteria expressed in the section and the expression
of them in
<b>Veen v. The Queen</b> <b>(No. 2)</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%2d1988%29%20164%20CLR%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987-1988) 164 CLR 465</a> by the High
Court when it dealt with the principle of proportionality and the
appropriateness of a sentence passed to protect the
community against
recidivism where the prior record manifests a continuing attitude of
disobedience to the law.  The court held that
in those circumstances a more
severe penalty may be warranted to serve the ends of retribution, deterrence
and protection of society.
 It was held that it was legitimate to utilise the
previous history to illuminate the moral culpability of the offender or as
showing
a dangerous propensity or a need to impose condign punishment to deter
him and other offenders from committing similar offences.
<P>

36  	Similarly, the purpose of sentencing has been expressed by
Badgery-Parker, AJ. in <b>Regina v. Dean Anthony &amp; Michael Privett</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20NSWSC%201076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 1076</a> when adopting what had been said by Allen, J. in <b>Regina v.
Camilleri</b> (CCA, unreported 8 February 1990).  His Honour quoted the
following passage from that judgment:-
<P>

"In seeking to determine in any case the sentence appropriate to a particular
crime it is always of importance to have regard to
the gravity of the offence
viewed objectively.  Unless that is done the other facts requiring
consideration in order to arrive at
the proper sentence cannot be given their
rightful place.  A sentence imposed must be commensurate with the seriousness
of the crime
in the sense that it should, having regard to the all the proved
circumstances, accord with the general moral sense of the community.
 It should
also serve as a sufficient deterrent both to the offender and to others.  The
purpose of that deterrence is to prevent
the commission of such offences, and
whilst justice and humanity require that the previous character and conduct and
the probable
future life and conduct of the individual offender should be given
most careful consideration, those are factors which are necessarily
subsidiary
to the main consideration which determines the appropriate amount of
punishment, that is the protection of the public.
 The fundamental purpose of
punishment is the protection of society.  Unless those basic principles of
sentencing are adhered to,
errors will occur."
<P>

37  	I consider that when regard is had to those principles on an
evaluation of the particular facts and surrounding circumstances
of the crime
(in which I include other related crime or criminal record relevant in the
sense referred to in <b>Veen (No. 2)</b> (supra)) and the conclusion reached
that the level of culpability is such that the community's interests as so
identified can only
be met by the permanent deprivation of liberty then the
maximum sentence is called for.
<P>

38  	Here the Crown in the context of what had been said in <b>Veen
(No. 2)</b> (supra) submitted that the very great heinousness to which
Badgery-Parker, J. referred in <b>Twala</b> (supra) must be taken to include
not only the actual manner in which the crime was committed, but also the
antecedent criminal history
of the offender.  I accept that submission as
applicable to s.431B criteria.
<P>

39  	Some guidance may be gained from previous decisions for whether
in these circumstances this case satisfies the statutory criteria
even though
they may have been given under the previous statutory or common law regime.
<P>

40  	The offence of murder by reason of felony murder arising out of
the use of a firearm in the course of an armed robbery is treated
most
seriously by the courts (see <b>Regina v. Mills</b> (Wood, J., unreported 2
June 1994).  Here, as in <b>Mills</b> (supra), the prisoner had deliberately
and consciously brought to the scene of the crime and presented to the deceased
a weapon in
a loaded state to commit an armed robbery and in circumstances
where resistance or spontaneous or unwilled discharge of the weapon
must, or
should, have been in contemplation even in the prisoner's intoxicated state.
Here the prisoner's record illustrates his
familiarity with how the courts
regard such conduct even without the fatal consequence.  His crime was very
grave indeed.
<P>

41  	The suggestion that cases of felony murder such as this involve
a lower level of culpability than cases of murder involving
intention to kill
and therefore should receive a lower level of sentence, has been rejected by
the Court of Criminal Appeal in <b>Regina v. Mills</b> (CCA, unreported 3 April
1995).  That rejection occurred in facts not unlike those in the present case.
The court was of the view
that in such circumstances such a case of murder
involved a very high degree of seriousness.  It did not, however, hold that
such
was the worst class of case.
<P>

42  	But it is clear that there may be differing degrees of objective
culpability even within felony murder (see <b>Regina v. JB,</b> <b>Regina v.
RJH</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/93.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCCA 93).</a>
<P>

43  	In <b>Regina v. Salameh</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/300.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCCA 300</a>, the Court of
Criminal Appeal on an appeal against a re-determination of a life sentence to a
sentence comprising a minimum term
of 23 years and an additional term of the
prisoner's natural life, considered the sentence in the context of
circumstances not unlike
the present.  That offender had a prior record almost
as appalling as that of the present prisoner and his circumstances had been
assessed by the trial judge as follows:-
<P>

"The applicant's shocking criminal history and present background cause
uncertainty in relation to the question of his rehabilitation.
 I believe there
is a serious question as to the extent to which he would represent a danger to
the community on being released to
parole.  On present indications there is a
substantial basis for concluding that he will commit further crimes if he is
released.
 This is not case of an uncharacteristic aberration.  It is a case of
an offender who has manifested a complete contempt of the courts
and procedures
of law in this country.  In such a case retribution, deterrence and protection
of society require that a more severe
penalty is warranted than would
ordinarily be the case."
<P>

44  	The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the sentence imposed by the
trial judge applying the totality principle in accordance with
what the High
Court had said in <b>The Queen v. Pearce</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20156%20ALR%20684" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 156 ALR 684.</a>  It was not
suggested that that record was such that by application to the re-determination
situation of the principles which now
are expressed in s.431B, the appellant
should be denied a determinate minimum term.
<P>

45  	I have particular regard for the terrible significance of a
sentence of life imprisonment as provided for by s.19A, which removes
forever
the prospect of release, and what has been said in regard to that sentence in
such cases as <b>Garforth</b> (supra);  <b>Regina v. Petrov</b> (Hunt, CJ. at
CL., unreported 12 November 1991);  <b>Regina v. Baker</b> (CCA, unreported 20
September 1995) and <b>Regina v. Rose</b> (Levine, J., unreported 3 September
1998).
<P>

46  	I have compared the circumstance of the present offence with
those set out in the schedule of life sentences under s.19A with
which I had
been provided.  The cases are not exhaustive but do embrace most of those where
such a sentence has been passed.  They
include the sentences passed on John
Wayne Glover, Rodney Francis Cameron, Malcolm George Baker, Maxwell Harold
Trotter, Robert Mark
Steele, Ivan Milat, Edwin Thomas Street, Richard William
Leonard, Earl Heatley, Arthur Stanley Smith, Garry Zane Glasby and Lindsay
Robert Rose.  Most of these crimes involved multiple murders with a common
factor or connection between the crimes such as would
aggravate each (see
<b>Street</b> (supra)).
<P>

47  	Alternatively, they were crimes committed in circumstances of
extreme callousness and depravity.  They are to be contrasted
with the crimes
of murder for which sentences other than life imprisonment have been passed, an
extensive schedule of which was also
provided to me.  I have also considered
the sentence statistics from the Judicial Commission for what limited
assistance they can
give.
<P>

48  	Even where, as here, the commission of the offence is attended
by the circumstances and the appalling record I have referred
to, and the
position is such that, when considered in conjunction with the prisoner's drug
addiction, the prospect of the prisoner
ever being rehabilitated or, at least,
being rehabilitated prior to, as Dr. Westmore put it, "advancing years in and
of themselves
being ... likely to reduce his overall risks of re-offending" is
limited, nonetheless, after considering in the way I have described
the kinds
of case for which the life penalty has been imposed, I am not satisfied , even
before turning to the prisoner's subjective
circumstances, that the prisoner's
present crime meets the statutory criteria.
<P>

49  	I accept that the life penalty is not reserved for those crimes
where there is no possibility of rehabilitation (<b>Garforth</b> (supra)).
<P>

50  	Having evaluated all relevant matters, I have concluded that
this is not a case where the circumstances require the imposition
of the
sentence under s.431B(1).  I am of the view that the community interest in
retribution, punishment, community protection and
deterrence can be met
otherwise than by the imposition of that sentence in the context of the
discretion that remains with me.  I
am therefore not satisfied of the matters
of which I must be satisfied before passing the mandatory sentence.
<P>

51  	I am of the view that the sentence that I will pass will be of
such length that, even in the context of Dr. Westmore's observations,
the
purposes of sentencing referred to in the section and by the High Court in
<b>Veen (No. 2)</b> (supra) will be served and that the statutory criteria can
be met by a determinate sentence.
<P>

52  	However, having regard to the prisoner's prior record in the
sense referred to in <b>Veen (No. 2)</b> (supra), together with the fact that
the armed robbery offence he was committing was itself an offence which
approached the worst
class of case for such offences, even putting aside its
fatal consequences, and to the fact that a life has been taken in this way
make
it necessary, notwithstanding the prisoner's subjective circumstances to which
I will turn in a moment, to pass on the prisoner
a sentence of great
severity.
<P>

53  	I note also that it would appear likely, because of the
prisoner's record of escapes and breaches of parole, that whilst in
custody he
will be detained in circumstances of strict security for a substantial portion
of his sentence.  Whilst this may be onerous
for him, nonetheless, it arises
because of his own actions and although regard must be had to that matter, it
cannot itself or in
combination with the other subjective circumstances, reduce
the length of the sentence that must be passed to such a point that the
sentence would become unduly disproportionate to the extreme gravity of his
crime.
<P>

54  	I turn to matters personal to the prisoner.  His incarceration
history as summarised by Ms. Jefferies and Ms. Danylenko commenced
with his
entry to a boys' home at the age of 10&#189;, the Juvenile Justice System at
age 14 and to adult gaols at age 18 when he
acquired his heroin dependence.  He
has had very little experience with any other community life or with personal
relationships.
<P>

55  	He had told Dr. Westmore that during the 10 years prior to his
release from custody shortly before committing this offence,
he had been on
methadone and about four to six weeks after his release started re-using
heroin, having formed his association with
the prisoner Jancek.
<P>

56  	I take the following material from the unchallenged recitation
of the prisoner's prior circumstances in the report of Dr. Westmore.
<P>

57  	He had initially turned to cannabis at 15 and heroin at 18.  He
had also tried numerous other illegal substances.  He has been
unable, despite
a number of attempts, to achieve any degree of rehabilitation, notwithstanding
his attending the WHO's Programme
and having been involved in gaol programmes
for many years.
<P>

58  	He was born in Yugoslavia and came to Australia with his family
at the age of one year.  His parents separated when he was
aged 10 or 11 years.
His father took him back to Yugoslavia against his mother's wishes and she had
disappeared when he and his father
returned to Australia.  He lived at that
time with his father but his father did not send him to school.  His mother,
with whom he
has lately resumed some contact, lives in Newcastle and he has
siblings with whom he has a poor relationship except with his younger
brother.
<P>

59  	Dr. Westmore, after referring to the prisoner's father not
sending him to school, continues:-
<P>

"Welfare agencies became involved and Mr. Petrinovic was initially placed into
the care of family friends who were unkind and possibly
abused him.  He ran
away from that home and was then cared for by a prostitute and her boyfriend.
The police caught him and he was
put into a boys' home for two years.  At that
time he could not return to his father because the welfare authorities would
not allow
this and his mother did not want him.
<P>

He was then placed into another institution for two years because there was
nowhere else for him to go.  He ran away to Kings Cross
where he met another
young person and they went to Tamworth where the young person had lived.
<P>

In Tamworth Mr. Petrinovic and the young person broke into garages, they were
caught and Mr. Petrinovic was placed back into a boys'
home for nine months.
He was aged 14&#189; at this time.
<P>

His mother than agreed to take him back provided he got a job and he then
worked with a carpenter until the age of 18.  He lived
at some stage in
Bathurst with the carpenter and his family and he worked successfully there
until work ran out and he returned to
Sydney.
<P>

Back in Sydney he engaged in a break and enter matter and was sent to prison
for 12 months and it was at that time that he started
using heroin.
<P>

On his release he was breaking and entering homes to get money to provide for
his heroin habit and he then served another nine months
in prison, being
released in April 1982.
<P>

He returned to prison in January 1983 for two armed robberies, he did four
years and escaped from custody once during that sentence.
 He was then out of
prison for four and a half months before being detained again for a series of
armed robberies, he received a
sentence of 10 years.  He was then out of prison
again for four and a half months before the current matter occurred.
<P>

I asked him about education and he said he attended first form and possibly
second form, he is literate.  I enquired about employment
and he said he worked
with the carpenter between the ages of 14&#189; and 18 but he has held no other
employment.  He has held some
short term relationships and he has some prison
tattoos."
<P>

60  	Dr. Westmore detected no psychosis but concluded his report:-
<P>

"This 39 year old man has, from the history, clearly led a life of extreme
deprivation.  He has been institutionalised for most
of his life, this occurred
after his parents separated when he was aged 10 or 11 years.  The initial
disappearance of his mother
and later her rejection of him would have been
extremely traumatic for this man when he was a child.  Mr. Petrinovic's father
also
appears to have had some difficulties and that man failed to make Mr.
Petrinovic attend school which attracted the attention of the
welfare
authorities.
<P>

Mr. Petrinovic has had a severely restricted education and a very limited work
history.  The most stable period of his life appears
to have occurred between
the ages of 14&#189; and 18 when he was working with a carpenter and living for
a period with that man and
his family.
<P>

At the age of 18 while in custody he was introduced to the drug heroin, he
developed a habit which extended up until the most recent
incident.  While
serving a term of imprisonment which lasted 10 years he commenced methadone and
he continued methadone on his release
from custody but he was unable to remain
heroin free.  The incident before the court at the time occurred as a direct
consequence
of this man's heroin addiction, his possession of a firearm and
perhaps to some extent a degree of polydrug intoxication.
<P>

During my meeting with him he appeared to be a subdued, despondent man with a
restricted affect.  He spoke spontaneously about his
feelings of sadness
regarding the death of the deceased and he talked about his life in a rather
hopeless way.
<P>

He no doubt suffers a degree of institutionalisation having been incarcerated
for such an extended period of time.  He is unskilled
and he has had a very
limited experience with employment.  I am uncertain what 'pre-release support'
this man had before his discharge
back into the community or what support was
available to him in the months leading up to this offence but in many ways
looking at
his life history one could almost have predicted that this man would
have experienced further difficulties when he returned to the
community.  His
deprived background, his lack of education and opportunity, his heroin habit,
his history of offending all placed
him in the high risk category of being
unable to cope, adjust or survive back in the community.
<P>

He is resigned to facing an extremely long sentence and he appeared to accept
this as being an inevitable part of the sequence of
events which followed the
death of Mr. Hagarty.
<P>

This man obviously is unlikely to be released for a number of years and while
it is too early to predict his re-offending risk at
this time, one can say that
advancing years in and of themselves are likely to reduce his overall risks of
re-offending.  Hopefully
during his incarceration he will receive some drug
counselling and eventually become methadone free."
<P>

61  	Even accepting, as I do, that the prisoner's childhood was
deprived, and that in the circumstances his addiction could hardly
be described
as a considered matter of personal choice, nonetheless it appears to me that at
best one can say that the prospect of
recidivism is high and that there is
little, if any, prospect of rehabilitation except in the sense spoken of by Dr.
Westmore.  The
sentence I intend to impose will involve retribution, deterrence
and protection for a period so long that Dr. Westmore's observation
cannot,
from a view this remote, be predicted as likely to be incorrect.
<P>

62  	This is a man for whom there is little prospect and against
whom, because of the matters to which I have referred, the community
is
entitled to have protection, in the light of his addiction and the record of
the crimes he has committed in feeding that addiction.
 This is not to say that
record is to be used to aggravate the sentence.  But it is to say one can find
little room for leniency
that might otherwise have been compassionately
extended where the community is put at such risk and where a crime so grave, as
involves
the taking of a human life, particularly in circumstances so serious
as this armed robbery, has been committed.  There is a necessity
to deter him
and others and to protect the community against his demonstrated dangerous
propensity.
<P>

63  	It would be appropriate since the sentence I will impose already
reflects the fact that the offence was committed whilst on
parole, that it be
dated from the day on which the prisoner returned to custody, 26 October 1997
in accordance with the principle
stated in <b>Regina v. Kaiva</b> (CCA,
unreported 9 November 1998).
<P>

64  	I also consider that the length of the sentence and the obvious
necessity that the prisoner should be under supervision for
a very long while,
if on parole after serving such a long custodial period, constitutes special
circumstances in that a longer than
usual additional term will be required and
I am of the view that a lengthy additional term in this case is appropriate as
a continuing
sanction.
<P>

65  	Regulation 10A of the Sentencing (General) Regulation 1996
provides that terms or conditions of parole orders must not require
the
offender to be subject to supervision for a period of more than three years
after the date of release but that the Board may,
in the case of a serious
offender, vary the term or condition so as to extend the period of supervision
for a further period of up
to three years, once only.  Such a condition will
become a condition of parole pursuant to Regulation 10 and as a consequence,
supervision
will be provided pursuant to Regulation 11.
<P>

66  	Thus up to six years of supervision may be provided, however,
the additional term does not exist solely for the purpose of
the provision of
supervision.  Indeed, an additional term should reflect those elements referred
to by the High Court in <b>Regina v. Bugmy</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/18.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 18</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20525" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 169 CLR 525</a> and may well
include, in addition to a period for which supervision is prescribed, a further
period during which the offender remains
subject to the sanction of return to
custody so as to reinforce rehabilitation and to provide protection, albeit of
a more limited
kind than that provided for by custody, to the community.  At
this time I would consider both the availability of that sanction and
the
extended period of supervision to be most important matters.
<P>

67  	Having regard to all the above circumstances, I am of the view
that a total sentence of 27 years penal servitude with a minimum
term of 20
years is called for. 
<P>

68  	Mr. Petrinovic you are sentenced to penal servitude for a
minimum term of 20 years to date from 26 October 1997 and to expire
on 25
October 2017.  There will be an additional term thereafter of seven years to
date from 26 October 2017 and to expire on 25
October 2024.  The earliest date
on which the prisoner will be eligible for release on parole is 25 October
2017.
