<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR : </b> 
<P>

1	     In orders made by consent on 13 October 1998 the Court ordered the
second defendant or his nominee to purchase the entire
shareholding of the
plaintiff in the first defendant free and unencumbered.  There are only two
shareholders, namely, the plaintiff
and the second defendant, and they each
have an equal number of shares. 
<P>

2		The short minutes of 13 October also note an agreement between the parties
relating to the determination of the purchase price
for the plaintiff's
shareholding. 
<P>

3		The agreement, when looked at closely, is not very clearly expressed in what
it prescribes as to the means of determining the
purchase price.  At a number
of places the document speaks as if what is to be ascertained is the purchase
price of the plaintiff's
shareholding.  This appears in the terms of Order 1 of
the consent orders and in the opening line of clause 1 of the agreement and
in
the opening two lines of clause 3.  However, clause 1, which purports to state
how the purchase price is to be determined, says
in its opening phrases that
what is to be determined is "<i>the value of the first defendant as at 13
October 1998</i>". That is to be determined by an expert Mr Dean-Willcocks on a
basis set out;  clause 1 provides:
<P>

	<i>"In making such determination Mr Dean-Willcocks shall be acting as an
independent expert whose decision shall be final and binding
on both parties
(save with respect to manifest error appearing on the face of the determination
or in the explanation therefor)</i><cite> provided</cite><i> that Mr
Dean-Willcocks must give a detailed </i>
<P>

<i>	explanation of how he has reached the value he determines."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>
<P>

4	     There are a number of detailed prescriptions about the things that Mr
Dean-Willcocks was to take into account in reaching
his conclusion and as to
how he was to regard them.  
<P>

5	     By clause 4 of the agreement it was provided that the plaintiff and also
the second defendant must deliver business documents
to Mr Dean-Willcocks by 16
October; that is, they incurred contractual obligations to deliver papers to
him by that date..  In my
opinion compliance with the obligations in clause 4
was not made a condition of the validity of any conclusion reached by Mr
Dean-Willcocks.
 In fact the expert gave his valuation in his letter of 25
November 1998 and the enclosures thereto, and he attributed a nominal
value of
one dollar to the plaintiff's share. 
<P>

6	     The plaintiff, by his Notice of Motion and now his Amended Notice of
Motion filed today seeks (Claim 1) orders which are
said to be necessary to
give effect to the consent order of 13 October 1998 requiring information to be
furnished to the valuer by
the second defendant, and some other orders,
including an order removing the valuer, an order requiring the valuer to state
the value
of assets of the company on either a market basis or a going concern
basis and give full reasons; an order requiring him to determine
the value of
the plaintiff's shareholding as one-half of the value of the company and not of
the value of one share being sold, and
some other procedural directions
<P>

7	     In an alternative claim the Court is asked to set aside the orders of 13
October 1998 and to take up the original proceedings
in the dispute between the
two shareholders, with claims for liquidation and for provisional liquidation
in the interim.
<P>

8	     I must say at once that no grounds have been shown on which the orders
of 13 October 1998 which were made by consent ought
to be set aside.  The
orders did not expressly deal with the principal claims in the liquidation,
that is for winding up, but ordered
by consent that the second defendant
purchase the plaintiff's shareholding, made some directions about costs,
adjourned the summons
to a stated date and reserved liberty to apply.  The form
of the orders suggests that they may not have been intended to be a final
disposition of the proceedings and it is easy to see, at least in relation to
the purchase, that liberty to apply was appropriate
and that the Court might be
asked further to exercise its powers with respect to carrying out the consent
order relating to the sale
of the shareholding.  In a broad way that order was
a resolution of the conflict among members of the company. 
<P>

9	Submissions on behalf of the plaintiff did not conform very well to the
claims in the Amended Notice of Motion but rather took
the form of an attack on
the expert's report and a claim that the report ought to be set aside.  As I
have earlier said, in my view
failures by the parties, in particular of the
second defendant, to comply with the contractual promise to produce information
do
not constitute a breach of a condition upon which the validity of the
expert's report depends.
<P>

10	     The expert's position can be distinguished very sharply from that of a
court or arbitrator acting on a defined body of evidence
and it is open to him
to proceed, as his report shows he did, in the absence of what, on the face of
things, would have been a complete
set of business records and, for example, to
proceed by inference as to periods for which records are not available based on
experience
and periods for which records are available.
<P>

11	     The grounds on which an expert's report may be attacked are very
limited.  In my view they were expounded in a way which
I should follow in the
judgment of McHugh J A in <b>Legal and General Life of Australia Limited v A
Hudson Pty Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%201%20NSWLR%20314" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 1 NSWLR 314.</a>  I particularly refer to his
Honour's statement of conclusions at pages 335 to 336 which, in my respectful
view, are well supported
by his Honour's reasons and his Honour's review of
case law.
<P>

12	     It is, I think, crystal clear that the expert's report cannot be set
aside on the ground that it is incorrect as a valuation
of the shares.  Much of
what counsel put to me was directed to the suggestion that that was so, or that
other conclusions than those
reached by the valuer can be based on the
information to which he refers.
<P>

13	     There was also a number of complaints about matters which it is said
the valuer should have investigated further or in respect
of which it is said
he should not have acted on limited material before him.  These contentions
related largely to the records produced
being incomplete, but it was also said
that he should have pursued further the second defendant's assertions about
what his loan
account was and the value of the trucks. 
<P>

14	     Criticisms of those kinds cannot lead, in my view, to the valuation
being set aside.  The valuation is liable to be set
aside only on some radical
basis to the effect that it is vitiated by conflict or collusion, or that for
some other reason it was
not a genuine endeavour to carry out the valuing task.
Its force is that expressly given to it by the parties, that is, the
determination
of an independent expert is final and binding on both parties
except with respect to manifest error on the face of the determination.
 It is
not, in my view, a manifest error to have acted on the materials available.
The context includes the need to proceed with
expedition having regard to the
time-table indicated by the order of 13 October 1998.  It was contemplated that
the purchase would
be resolved during the adjournment of the summons and before
17 December 1998.  
<P>

15	     Criticism was specifically directed to the reference in the report
under the heading "(<cite>ii) Basis of Valuation</cite>", where the valuer
proceeded by valuing one of two shares in a proprietary limited company and
said, "<i>a logical purchaser ... would likely do so in the knowledge that it
would be a 50% shareholder going forward with Mr Witts as the
other 50%
shareholder."</i>  This appears to me to indicate that the valuer valued the
plaintiff's shares in a hypothetical sale to a hypothetical purchaser
who would
have to take into account in considering what he would pay the fact that he
would then become a fifty per cent holder with
the second defendant.  It was
contended that this was wrong in principle and departed from the provisions of
the agreement noted
in the Order.
<P>

16	     In my view, the agreement of the parties does not state in a clear and
express way on what basis, whether a hypothetical
sale or by taking the value
of the company's assets and halving them, the amount of the purchase price is
to be determined by the
expert.  However, their intention can be ascertained by
inference from what the document does say.  It repeatedly refers, as I have
said, to the thing to be determined as the purchase price for the plaintiff's
shareholding.   At one place in clause 1 it refers
to "<i>the value of the
first defendant as at 13 October 1998"</i> as the thing to be determined, the
first defendant being the company, but it does not say what is to be done with
that value when
determined. 
<P>

17	     The plaintiff's counsel put forward the reading that that value is to
be halved and to be taken as the amount to be paid.
There is much force in this
contention, but it is, however, an inference along with another available
inference on the meaning of
the document, and the preponderance of the
references appears to me to establish that what the expert was to do was to
determine
the price in a hypothetical sale of the plaintiff's shares.  In doing
so he was to have regard in some way not spelt out to the value
of the whole of
the company - I suppose meaning the whole of its assets - as at the material
date.  Of course he would have to have
regard to them in any rational exercise
of addressing what would be paid by a hypothetical purchaser.
<P>

18	     In my view the expert made no error in principle and did not set about
valuing the wrong subject matter when he included
in the basis of his valuation
consideration of what would be in the mind of a purchaser acting logically.
<P>

19	     In any event, on the rest of his reasoning, bringing that matter into
account appears to me to have had no influence, because
when the expert brought
into consideration costs and expenses of $15,000 ordered to be paid by the
company under Order 2 of 13 October
1998, the balance of the value of the
company's assets as determined by him was negative.  This appears at paragraph
(vi) of his
valuation and is illustrated by his two annexures B and C.
Annexure B produces possible net assets at 30 June, including goodwill,
of
$9615 and Annexure C carries that forward to 13 October by reaching a possible
profit on pro rata reasoning to achieve a total
of $11,715 and then deducting
the costs of $15,000 to produce the deficiency in assets.
<P>

20	     Like other parts of his report these pages show recognition of the
indeterminacy of many of the conclusions on which it
is based, and the word
"<i>possible</i>" appears frequently.  Obviously a high degree of accuracy was
not regarded by the expert as attainable on the information on which
he acted.
However, the margin of deficiency is significant and there is room for the
deficiency to vary widely, up to $3225, before
it could have any final impact
on the nominal value attributed to the plaintiff's share.
<P>

21	     The answer is the same even if the different method had been adopted in
which the net value of the company's assets is ascertained
and then halved.

<P>

22	     I propose to dismiss the Amended Notice of Motion.  By so doing the
need to address the plaintiff's Cross Motion by Notice
dated 11 March 1999 is
resolved. 
<P>

23	     The order is: the plaintiff's Amended Notice of Motion of 6 April 1999
is dismissed.  The defendant's Notice of Motion of
11 March 1999 is dismissed.

<P>

24	     I order that the plaintiff pay the defendant's costs of the Notice of
Motion of 5 February 1999 and the Amended Notice of
Motion of 6 April 1999.  I
order that each party pay his own costs of the second defendant's Notice of
Motion of 11 March 1999.
<P>
