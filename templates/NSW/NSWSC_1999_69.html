<b>JUDGMENT  (Particulars of comment &amp; qualified privilege - contextual
imputations - capacity &amp; form - cross-claim - abuse of
process - defective
pleading)</b>
<P>

1	This action has been the subject of judgments and rulings as follows:  Dowd J
27 November 1995;  Levine J 30 November 1995;  Studdert
J 5 June 1996;  Levine
J 29 August 1997.
<P>

2	By a Statement of Claim filed on 22 September 1994 the two plaintiffs sue in
respect of a publication on or about 4 December 1992.
 The publication as I
understand it is a letter from Mr Bhagat to a Ms Marie Nixon of Baker &amp;
McKenzie solicitors.  The letter,
it is said, was published as set out in the
particulars of publication in paragraph 4.
<P>

3	The plaintiffs contend that the matter complained of conveys of each of them
(that is, the two corporations) the following imputations:
<P>

	<i>"5(a)	the first and second plaintiffs behaved in so suspicious a manner as
to warrant the suggestion that they might have accepted
a bribe;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the first and second plaintiffs behaved in so suspicious a manner as to
warrant careful scrutiny of proposals they put forward".</i>
<P>

4	On 17 December 1997 the defendants filed their Defence.  The defences include
comment, qualified privilege, justification pursuant
to s 15 and contextual
justification pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act, 1974</a>.</i>
<P>

5	The contextual imputations are as follows:
<P>

	<i> "9(a) ...</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	The first and second plaintiffs behaved in so suspicious a manner as to
warrant the suggestion that they might have accepted
a bribe.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	The first and second plaintiffs behaved in so suspicious a manner as
to warrant careful scrutiny of proposals they put forward
because of the
possibility that they have been bribed.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	The third plaintiff has behaved in such manner as to warrant the
suggestion that he dishonestly colluded with John Murphy with
a view to
obtaining extortionate payments for Global.</i>
<P>

	<i>(iv)	The first and second plaintiffs are dishonest.</i>
<P>

	<i>(v)	The third plaintiff is dishonest.</i>
<P>

	<i>(vi)	The third plaintiff conspired with John Murphy for Global to receive
payments to which it was not entitled.</i>
<P>

	<i>(vii)	The plaintiffs so conducted themselves that they warranted the
allegation that they were acting to the disadvantage of thousands
of unit
holders who are elderly and helpless and are unable to protect their
interests.</i>
<P>

	<i>(viii)	The third plaintiff so conducted himself that he warranted the
allegation that there was a possible collusion between himself
and John
Murphy.</i>
<P>

	<i>(ix)	The plaintiffs unjustifiably received excessive payments.</i>
<P>

	<i>(x)	The plaintiffs paid themselves excessive remuneration in the sum of $4
million a year.</i>
<P>

	<i>(xi)	The plaintiffs so conducted themselves they warranted being reported
to the Australian Securities Commission.</i>
<P>

	<i>(xii)	The third plaintiff conducted himself in such manner that he
warranted the allegation that a financially distressed large borrower
might
make him an offer which would be subject to scrutiny.</i>
<P>

	<i>(xiii)	The plaintiffs conducted themselves in such manner as to warrant the
allegation that settlement proposals with large borrowers
and those already
approved should be scrutinised to obviate any suspicion".</i> 
<P>

6	In relation to the contextual imputations it is to be noted that several of
them refer to a third plaintiff (Grant Smith);  he
is no longer a plaintiff
however he is a third cross-defendant in the cross-claim filed on 20 November
1997 to which I will come
shortly.
<P>

7	In the course of submissions it was agreed that by consent contextual
imputations (i), (ii), (iii), (v), (vi) and (xii) should
be struck out. 
<P>

8	For clarification, it is to be noted that on 6 September 1996, by consent, I
made orders the effect of which was to "<i>deconsolidate</i>" the proceedings
constituted by Mr Grant Smith being a plaintiff.  He was granted leave to
commence fresh proceedings in his own
name which I am informed he did on 13
December 1996 in matter number 21327 of 1996.
<P>

9	Mr Smith however is a plaintiff against Mr Bhagat and others in matter number
20929 of 1994.
<P>

10	By Notice of Motion filed on 4 December 1997 the applicant plaintiffs seek
to have the Defence struck out or alternatively, further
and better particulars
supplied; they seek to have the cross-claim struck out in whole or in part and
consequential orders.
<P>

11	The matters raised in relation to the Defence cover, in effect, the same
ground as was covered in my judgment delivered today
in matters 16709 of 1991
and 20930 of 1994 in relation to comment and qualified privilege in
particular.
<P>

12	The same defects to which I adverted in my judgment above referred to in
relation to the particulars of comment and qualified
privilege are applicable
here and accordingly, I propose to order the defendants to provide full and
proper particulars in response
to requests numbered 1, 2 and 3 in the letter
dated 21 October 1997 from Messrs Cowley Hearne to Mr Bhagat. 
<P>

13	I add that I am reinforced in requiring formalised particulars particularly
in relation to the defence of comment in the light
of the concessions made by
Mr Evatt at p 14 of the transcript of the hearing before me on 17 December
1997.
<P>

14	In respect of the particulars of Mitigation of Damages I will allow (in
relation to disputed matters) particulars (ii), (iii)
and (iv).  I will strike
out (v), (vi) and (vii) for the reasons stated in my earlier judgment in matter
16709/91.
<P>

15	As to contextual imputations:  contextual imputations 9(a)(i) and (ii) are,
by consent, struck out. 
<P>

16	I strike out contextual imputation 9(a)(iv) on the <b><i>Drummoyne</i></b>
principle.  
<P>

17	As to contextual imputation 9(a)(vii) I strike this out as not differing in
substance from the plaintiffs' second pleaded imputation.
 
<P>

18	As to contextual imputations 9(a)(ix) and (x), bearing in mind the
principles stated in <b><i>Drummoyne,</i></b> I am not persuaded in these
instances that they are incapable of being conveyed nor are bad in form and
thus they shall go to the
jury.  
<P>

19	As to contextual imputation 9(a)(xi), objection is taken to "<i>so conducted
themselves</i>".  I can see no difference between that phrase and the use of
the word "<i>behaved</i>" in the plaintiffs' imputation.  Contextual imputation
9(a)(xi) will go to the jury. 
<P>

20	As to contextual imputation 9(a)(xiii) I have given this much consideration.
It adopts the language of the second of the plaintiffs'
imputations.  I am
persuaded however that notwithstanding that device it does not differ in
substance from it.  This is a case where
legitimately, in my view, recourse can
be had to the matter complained of itself.  The thrust of the matter is the
suggestion of
bribery in the context of a position taken by a large borrower.
The essence, in my view, of contextual imputation 9(a)(xiii) is the
same as
that of the plaintiffs' imputation 5(b) and, accordingly, it will be struck
out. 
<P>

21	I turn now to the Cross-Claim.  It was filed on 20 November 1997.  The three
defendants are the cross-claimants.  The two plaintiffs'
are the first and
second cross-defendants respectively and Mr Grant Smith is the third
cross-defendant.
<P>

22	The first cause of action pleaded in the cross-claim is in defamation
arising from the publication alleged to have taken place
in June 1993 of a
letter which is appended to the cross-claim.  As I read the cross-claim the two
causes of action in defamation
(the second arising from a publication in August
1994) are brought by Mr Bhagat only.
<P>

23	Whilst it is the second component of the cross-claim, namely, the cause of
action for abuse of process pleaded in paragraph 5
that attracted attention
during the course of submissions, the causes of action brought by the first
cross-claimant only did not
receive much attention.  Certainly no attention was
given to the fact that in relation to the first publication the first
cross-claimant
pleads fourteen imputations and in relation to the second matter
complained of he pleads a mere eight.  It was acknowledged, however,
in the
course of submissions, and very much in passing, that if the cross-claim or so
much of it as is constituted by the two actions
in defamation remains on the
record there will be the inevitable interlocutory applications in regard to the
imputations.
<P>

24	Insofar as I am not predisposed to strike out so much of the cross-claim as
is constituted by the causes of action in defamation
(the subject matters'
coincidence with the plaintiffs' action is obvious), the cross-claimant will be
ordered to file an Amended
Cross-Claim that has incorporated in a legible form
the text of the matters complained of.  The file copy of the document lodged
on
20 November 1997 has no annexures.  Indeed, Mr Evatt conceded that the
cross-defendants are entitled to a pleading in proper form
at least in that
regard and as I understood it, a concession was made that the cross-defendants
are entitled, <i>a fortiori</i> given the number of imputations, to precise
particulars as to which part or parts of the matters complained of give rise to
such
imputations.  In any amended cross-claim those particulars are to be
appended as such.  
<P>

25	It appears to me that the real complaint in relation to the cross-claim is
the pleading in paragraph 5 of a cause of action for
abuse of process.  The
cross-claim was filed approximately 17 months after the decision of Studdert J
(5 June 1996) in which his
Honour declined for the reasons he stated to stay or
strike out the plaintiffs' action for abuse of process (and for want of
prosecution).
<P>

26	It is contended for the plaintiffs that this cross-claim is a device to
canvass or cavil with the orders his Honour made on an
interlocutory basis.
<P>

27	The orders his Honour made were interlocutory (any appeal to the Court of
Appeal would have to be by leave) (s 101(2)(e) <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act, 1970</a></i>).
Indeed, had his Honour made the orders sought they would still be on an
interlocutory basis.  I am not persuaded as was argued
for the plaintiffs' that
his Honour's orders constitute an issue estoppel.  It is also clear that the
pleading of the cross-claim
covers a lot of material that does not appear to
have been before Studdert J.  I have not been persuaded that as a matter of
principle
that because a stay of proceeding on the grounds of abuse of process
is <i>not</i> granted at an interlocutory stage, it follows that a final
hearing on such a cause of action cannot take place (compare <b><i>Goldsmith v
Sperrings Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%201%20WLR%20478" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 1 WLR 478)).</a>
<P>

28	It was next argued by Mr Henskens for the plaintiff and Mr Caspersonn for Mr
Smith (the third cross-defendant) that the cross-claim
should be struck out, as
I understand it, as unarguably unsustainable.  Particular reference in this
regard was made to the statement
in paragraph 5(n) that the cross-defendants
had "<i>conspired</i>" with one another to make false and exaggerated claims
for financial loss.  This is to be compared with the statement in paragraph
5(q) to the effect that the third cross-defendant's employment was terminated
because he was in dispute with members of the Global
Funds (as it was then
called) Board.  It was argued that given such a dispute as pleaded it is highly
unlikely that there would be
this "<i>conspiracy</i>" to abuse the process of
the Court.  This is to isolate from a rambling, shambolic recitation of factual
material in the pleading
(to which I will return) and elevate to it a
foundation for striking it out on the basis referred to in circumstances where
by reason
of the pleading itself it is impossible to come to the view that no
case can be made out.  Despite the quality of the pleading (or
lack of it),
there is, in my view, material in it that precludes such a course being taken
on that basis.  It has to be acknowledged
however that the point raised by
counsel for the relevant parties exposes a potential, to say the least,
inconsistency in the stand
taken by the cross-claimants.
<P>

29	The more appropriate basis for dealing with the cross-claim is under SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p15" class="autolink_findacts">Pt
15</a> r 26 (1)(b).
<P>

30	The cross-defendants can legitimately claim, in my view, as to that
component of the cross-claim that purports to plead the cause
of action in
abuse of process that it is a rhetorical recitation of complaint rather a more
formal pleading as is desirable: for
example, the use of such expressions as
"<i>basically ...</i>" (5(b));  "<i>the cross-defendants regarded the first and
second cross-claimants as thorns in their side"</i> (5(d));  the use of the
word "<i>conspired</i>" in 5(n) without particulars of the matters that
constitute the agreement going to establish the conspiracy amount to legitimate
bases for complaint about the document as a pleading.  
<P>

31	Shortly stated therefore, the cross-claim will be struck out on the basis
that the causes of action pleaded in defamation are
embarrassing, the pleading
contains no attachments constituted by the publications complained of nor
particulars as to the relevant
passages of the matters complained of that give
rise to the extraordinary number of imputations; and, secondly, the pleading of
the
cross-claim for abuse of process can only be viewed, as I have indicated,
as a hopeless, rhetorical narrative which should be formalised
in a sensible
and proper way.  
<P>

32	At this stage I certainly do not intend to strike out the cross-claim on the
basis that Mr Smith, the third cross-defendant,
is not a plaintiff in the
proceedings.  He is a plaintiff against Mr Bhagat in other proceedings, true it
is, in which there is no
cross-claim.
<P>

33	It is appropriate at this stage to remark that these proceedings and the
accompanying proceedings in which judgments are being
delivered today are
unlikely to be heard in the twentieth century.  Each of the proceedings is
flawed in the various ways referred
to in the judgments and the situation has
been reached where nothing should be done about either consolidation or
deconsolidation,
making orders as the actions being heard together or
otherwise, and the like, until, in each case, the litigation is clearly and
irrevocably in order. 
<P>

34	In the current application the plaintiffs and the third cross-defendant have
succeeded and the order for costs will be framed
accordingly.
<P>

35	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	Contextual imputations 9(a)(i), (ii), (iii), (v), (vi) and (xii) by consent,
are struck out.
<P>

2.	The defendants are to supply proper further and better particulars of the
defence of comment and qualified privilege, in response
to the plaintiffs'
solicitors' letter of 21 October 1997 within 28 days.
<P>

3.	Particulars (v), (vi) and (vii) of the particulars of Mitigation of Damages
are struck out.
<P>

4.	The defendants are to provide proper further and better particulars of
particular (viii) of Mitigation of Damages, within 28
days.
<P>

5.	Contextual imputations 9(a)(iv), (vii) and (xiii) are struck out.
<P>

6.	Contextual imputations 9(a)(ix), (x) and (xi) will go to the jury.
<P>

7.	The defendants have leave to file an Amended Defence within 28 days.
<P>

8.	The cross-claim is struck out.
<P>

9.	The cross-claimants have leave to file an Amended Cross-Claim in accordance
with these reasons within 28 days.
<P>

10.	The defendants and cross-claimants are to pay the costs of the plaintiff
and the third cross-defendant.
<P>

11.	At the expiry of 28 days, liberty to restore to the Defamation List on 3
days notice.
