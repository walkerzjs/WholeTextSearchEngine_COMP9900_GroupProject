<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	This case is about the validity of a deed of option dated 15 September 1998.
The plaintiff Strand Estates Pty Ltd seeks a declaration
that the option was
granted to it to purchase the property known as 4A Starkey Street Forestville
(the property) on 15 September
1998.  It also seeks declarations that the
option is not void pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66zg.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66ZG</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a> (NSW) and
that it has extended the option until 15 September 1999.  The plaintiff also
seeks a declaration that the purported rescission
of the option pursuant to a
letter dated 5 March 1999 from the defendant's solicitors is void.
<P>

2	The defendant Miako Yamamoto is the registered proprietor of the property and
by cross claim seeks a declaration that the deed
of option is not in force.
<P>

3	The hearing of this matter has been expedited.  The summons was filed on 16
March 1999 and it was listed for urgent hearing on
Wednesday 31 March 1999.
Evidence was concluded by 4 pm on 1 April 1999 and final submissions were made
on the afternoon of 6 April
1999, Easter intervening. Leave was granted to both
counsel to provide any further submissions in writing by 4pm on 8 April
1999.This
leave related to any matters arising out of the detailed outlines
that had been provided by each counsel on 6 April 1999 (Tr 176
l 17-22).  I
listed the matter again on 9 April 1999 for reasons with which I will deal
later and I then reserved my judgment in
the matter. 
<P>

	<b>The parties and their history</b>
<P>

4	The plaintiff company is a property developer and was represented in its
negotiations with the defendant by a firm of solicitors
Messrs Somerville &amp;
Co.  The solicitor at the firm handling the conveyancing matters for the
plaintiff was Mr Robert John Picone.
<P>

5	The defendant is married to Mr Francis Joseph Mansfield who is an accountant
and, although not legally qualified, has handled
some 20 conveyances for
various members of his family. Mr Mansfield acted for and/or assisted the
defendant in her dealings with
the plaintiff in respect of the option
agreement.  The defendant instructed Mr Coyne, solicitor, of Messrs Coyne
Whittemore solicitors
in respect of the purported rescission of the option and
to act for her in these proceedings.
<P>

6	The history between the parties can be conveniently summarised as follows:
<P>

6.1	On 23 August 1997 an option was granted by the defendant to the plaintiff
to purchase the property for $430,000 (the first option).The
deed of option
provided for an extension of the option for a further 6 months for a fee of
$5,000.  When the defendant granted the
first option she understood that the
plaintiff would be attempting to have the property rezoned as commercial as it
was hoping to
develop it. 
<P>

6.2	On 18 February 1998 the first option was extended  to 23 August 1998 by the
plaintiff serving a notice of extension of the option
together with the $5,000
fee (the extended first option).
<P>

6.3	On 13 August 1998 the defendant agreed to grant to the plaintiff a further
option to purchase the property for $485,000 (the
second option). The defendant
wrote to the plaintiff's real estate agents in early August 1998 and stated
that the <i>1307M2 land value (VG) has increased by $74,000 in the past 12
months, and will be rezoned COMMERCIAL</i> <i>in a matter of weeks</i>.
<P>

6.4	A draft option agreement was prepared by Mr Picone and forwarded to the
defendant on 1 September 1998.  Mr Picone's letter requested
the defendant to
<i>please sign the option and return it to us for exchange. Once exchanged, we
shall forward the option fees to you forthwith</i>. This draft was unacceptable
to the defendant as cl 14 referred to option fees forming part of the purchase
price and the completion
date in the draft contract was stated as twelve weeks
instead of the agreed six weeks.
<P>

6.5	On 4 September 1998 after receiving advice of these matters from the
defendant via Messrs Colliers Jardine Mr Picone prepared
an amended deed of
option reflecting the amendments sought by the defendant. 
<P>

6.6	On 6 September 1998, prior to receiving the amended deed prepared by Mr
Picone, Mr Mansfield forwarded a fax to him in which
he stated that <i>the
grantor can sign proposed deed of option and contracts can be exchanged
tomorrow morning if cl 14 and completion date is amended.
 Please phone to
confirm.</i>
<P>

6.7	On 7 September 1998 Mr Mansfield and the defendant received Mr Picone's
amended deed under cover of his letter of 4 September
1998.  That letter
enclosed the amended deed of option and requested the defendant to remove the
previous deed and attach the enclosed
deed to the contract for the sale of the
property which was already in the defendant's possession.  As there was a lease
referred
to in the draft contract Mr Picone asked the defendant to ensure that
a copy of the lease was attached to it. Mr Picone's letter
stated once again
<i>please sign the option and return it to us for exchange.  Once exchanged, we
shall forward the option fees to you forthwith.</i>
<P>

6.8	On 8 September 1998 Mr Mansfield attended Mr Picone's office.  The versions
of the parties as to the reason for this attendance
differs and I will deal
with these later.  However although Mr Mansfield did not see Mr Picone on that
day he left the deed of option
executed by the defendant at Mr Picone's office.
The deed was dated <i>eighth</i> September 1998 and was with a covering letter
signed by the defendant which stated  <i>enclosed is executed deed of option,
witnessed by my husband, for exchange.</i>
<P>

6.9	On 11 September a telephone conversation took place between Mr Picone and
Mr Mansfield.  The parties' versions of this communication
differ. The
plaintiff claims that its version supports its assertion that Mr Picone was
authorised to exchange the deeds in Mr Mansfield's
absence and, for the
purposes of the exchange, as agent for the defendant. The defendant claims her
version supports her assertion
that an exchange was to take place in Mr
Mansfield's presence who was to be her agent for the purposes of the
exchange.
<P>

6.10	On 15 September 1998 Mr Picone purported to exchange the deeds of option
and date the counterpart executed by his client 15
September 1998.  He also
changed the date on the deed of option provided to him by Mr Mansfield from
eighth September to 15 September
1998.
<P>

6.11	On 16 September 1998 Mr Picone forwarded the exchanged deed executed by
his client together with the $5,000 fee to the defendant
under cover of a
letter of that date which stated in part <i>we refer to exchange of options in
this matter, which took place on 15 September 1998.  We enclose duly exchanged
grantee's counterpart.</i>
<P>

6.12	On 16 September 1998 a further telephone conversation between Mr Picone
and Mr Mansfield occurred. Once again the versions
of the conversation differ.
The plaintiff claims that Mr Mansfield was informed that the exchange had been
completed the previous
day and that the deed and cheque were being sent to the
defendant that day. The defendant claims that Mr Mansfield was not informed
the
exchange had taken place and further that he asked Mr Picone to get back to him
with a time for what he understood would be an
exchange at which he would be
present.
<P>

6.13	On 17 September 1998 the defendant received Mr Picone's letter of 16
September enclosing the exchanged deed of option signed
by the plaintiff
together with the option fee of $5,000. The defendant banked the cheque the
following day.
<P>

6.14	There was apparently no communication between the plaintiff and the
defendant until March 1999 but during that period the defendant
was approached
by a number of other parties in respect of the possible purchase of the
property.  
<P>

6.15	On 26 February 1999 the defendant entered into a contract with Emesco
Agents Pty Ltd (Emesco) for the sale of the property
for $650,000 subject to
the option with Strand Estates. 
<P>

6.16	On 4 March 1999 Strand Estates purported to extend the second option to 15
September 1999 by serving on the defendant a written
notice of extension of the
option together with the required fee of $5,000.
<P>

6.17	On 5 March 1999 a local newspaper, Northern Beaches Weekender, reported
that Coles had that week lodged a development application
with the Warringah
Council for a <i>$10 million retail development which would incorporate a state
of the art Coles Supermarket </i>on property adjacent to the defendant's
property.
<P>

6.18	On 5 March 1999 Mr Coyne faxed a letter to Mr Picone purporting to rescind
the second option and enclosed a cheque for $5,000
payable to the plaintiff
purporting to be a refund of the option fee paid in September 1998. The
purported rescission was claimed
to be pursuant <i>to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66zi.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.66ZI(1)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a></i> <i>(the Act) </i>in that certain documents required
by <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s52a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52A</a></i> of the act to be attached to the option were not so
attached.
<P>

6.19	On 8 March 1999 Mr Picone wrote to Mr Coyne advising him that all the
relevant documents were attached to the second option
and requested a
withdrawal of the purported notice of rescission.
<P>

6.20	On 8 March 1999 Mr Coyne advised Mr Picone by letter that the notice of
rescission was not to be withdrawn and that if the
plaintiff commenced
proceedings the defendant would rely upon a further ground for rescission that
<i>the deed did not contain the Cooling off Notice as required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66zh.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section
66ZH(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a></i>. The letter also stated that the defendant
<i>rejects your <b>application</b> to extend the period of the option </i>and
returned the $5,000 fee that had been forwarded to the defendant with the
notice of extension on 4 March 1999.
<P>

7	These proceedings were then commenced. Mr McEwen SC appeared for the
plaintiff. Mr G Cummins of counsel appeared for the defendant.
<P>

	<b>The law</b>
<P>

8	Options for the purchase of residential property are governed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/index.html#p4" class="autolink_findacts">Part 4</a>
Division 9 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a> (the Act).
<P>

9	Every option is required to have attached to it a copy of the proposed
contract for the sale of the property and the documents
required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s52a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52A</a> of the
Act <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66zi.html" class="autolink_findacts">(S 66ZI</a> of the Act).
<P>

10	The documents required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s52a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52A</a> of the Act include relevantly a certificate
issued under s 149(2) of the Environmental Planning and<b><i>
</i></b>Assessment Act 1979; a diagram for the land from the appropriate
sewerage authority; a copy of the folio of the register or an original
or a
copy of the computer folio certificate for the land; a copy of the plan of the
land; a copy of all deeds, dealings and instruments
creating easements and
covenants burdening the land and a copy of a notice entitled Important Notice
to Vendors and Purchasers referring
to significant rights and obligations
affecting the contract<b><i>. </i></b>(Clause 4 Conveyancing (Vendor Disclosure
and Warranty) Regulation 1986).  
<P>

11	If the documents required to be attached are not attached either party may
rescind the contract (s66ZI of the Act).
<P>

12	Subject to s66ZC of the Act to which I will refer shortly, there is a
cooling off period for every option commencing at the time
the option is
granted and concluding at 5 pm of the fifth business day after the day on which
the option was granted. The purchaser
is entitled to rescind the option during
the cooling off period (s66ZB and s66ZD of the Act).
<P>

13	Every option not affected by s66ZC must include a statement in the
prescribed form relating to the cooling off period.  (s66ZH
of the Act and
Clause 8 Conveyancing (Sale of Land) Regulation 1988).  If this statement is
not included in the option either party
may rescind the option (s66ZH of the
Act).
<P>

14	However there is no cooling off period in relation to an option to purchase
residential property if at or before the time the
option is granted, the
purchaser gives to the vendor (or the vendor's solicitor or agent) a
certificate that complies with s66ZF
(s66ZC of the Act). 
<P>

15	A certificate complies with s66ZF if it is in writing and is signed by a
solicitor or barrister other than; -  
<P>

	i	a solicitor acting for the vendor; or
<P>

	ii	any other solicitor employed in the legal practice of a solicitor acting
for the vendor;  or any other solicitor who is a member
or employee of a firm
of which a solicitor acting for the vendor is a member or employee;  and
<P>

	iii	indicates the purpose for which the certificate is given;  and
<P>

	iv	contains a statement to the effect that the solicitor or barrister
explained to the purchaser the effect of the option and the
proposed contract
attached to the option, the nature of the certificate and the effect of giving
the certificate to the vendor.
<P>

	
<P>

16	If the certificate does not comply with s66ZF or if it does comply and is
not served in accordance with s66ZC then there is a
cooling off period and a
requirement for inclusion of the prescribed form of statement with the
consequent right of rescission if
it is not included.
<P>

17	An option granted for the purchase of residential property is void in the
following circumstances;
<P>

	(a)	unless it is granted by way of exchange of counterparts, one of which is
signed by the purchaser and the other signed by the
vendor, or
<P>

	(b)	 it is exercisable within 42 days after it is granted or, if a different
period is prescribed, within that period (s66ZG of
the Act).
<P>

	<b>Abandonment of ground for rescission that s 52A documents were not
attached</b>
<P>

18	A great deal of time was spent in this case in testing the defendant's claim
that when she received the deed for the second option
from Mr Picone on 17
September 1999 only one document required by s 52A to be attached to the deed
was attached. This claim formed
a most important part of the defendant's case
as it was the original ground for rescission of the second option.
<P>

19	After the evidence was closed and at the commencement of final submissions I
was informed by Mr Cummins that the defendant no
longer relied upon this ground
as it was accepted she would <i>not be able to establish that the prescribed
documents were not attached (Tr. 162 l 7-9).</i>
<P>

	<b>Remaining grounds claimed by the defendant</b>
<P>

20	Notwithstanding this abandonment the defendant claims that she is still
entitled to rescind the option pursuant to s 66ZH because:
<P>

	(a)	 at or before the time the second option was granted she did not receive a
s 66ZF certificate from the plaintiff ( s 66ZC);
and
<P>

	(b)	in those circumstances the second option should have included but did not
include a statement in the prescribed form relating
to the cooling off period
(s66ZH).
<P>

21	A further basis for rescission is claimed because Mr Picone rather than the
defendant prepared the draft option and contract
and attached the required
documents thereto. It is submitted by Mr Cummins that s 66ZI of the act should
be read as requiring the
grantee/vendor to attach the required documents. As
this did not occur in this case it is submitted the defendant is entitled to
rescind the contract.
<P>

22	Additionally the defendant claims that the second option is void because;
<P>

	(a)	at the time of the purported exchange on 15 September 1998 by Mr Picone,
even if it is accepted the exchange could take place
in this fashion, the
documents he purported to exchange were not <i>counterparts; </i>and
<P>

<i>	</i>(b)	the option was not granted until the deed was received by the
defendant on 17 September 1998 and is therefore void because it
was exercisable
within 42 days after it was granted. This is said to be so because clause 11 of
the second option provides that the
option shall not be exercised within 42
days of the <i>date of the deed </i>(s 66ZG).
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Plaintiff's claims</b>
<P>

23	The plaintiff claims that the second option is valid and binding on the
parties and that it has been validly extended to 15 September
1999.The
plaintiff submits that;
<P>

<i>	</i>(a)	exchange of counterparts took place on 15 September 1998 at which
time Mr Picone was acting for the plaintiff and was acting as
the defendant's
agent for the purpose of the exchange. The second option was therefore granted
on 15 September 1998 and is not void
under s 66ZG;
<P>

<i>	</i>(b)	Mr Picone completed a certificate under section s 66ZF on 15
September 1998 at a time when he was acting only for the plaintiff.
That
certificate was inside the front page of the deed when it was exchanged.
Accordingly the defendant received it by her agent,
Mr Picone, at the time of
exchange. It is submitted that this was when the grant was made. In those
circumstances s 66ZH does not
apply and the defendant is therefore not entitled
to rescind the option in reliance upon that section;
<P>

	(c)	 the defendant is estopped from denying exchange took place on 15
September 1998 and effectively that a valid option was granted
on 15 September
1998. 
<P>

24	The outcome of this case depends upon the answer to at least the following
questions;
<P>

<i>	</i>24.1	Was Mr Picone authorised to act as the defendant's agent for the
purpose of the exchange of the deed of option? <i>(the agency question)</i>.
<P>

<i>	</i>24.2	Were the documents as exchanged counterparts?<i> (the
counterparts</i> <i>question)</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>24.3	When was the option granted?<i> ( the grant question)</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><b>The agency question</b>
<P>

25	Mr Mansfield gave evidence that he wanted to exchange the contracts in
person.  He said he made contact with Mr Picone's office
and spoke with Amanda
to make an appointment to attend upon Mr Picone for exchange.  His affidavit
evidence was that he made that
contact on Tuesday 8 September in the morning.
He said that Amanda had asked him whether he could come in at 9.30 am the
following
day to which he responded that he would be attending at that time.
<P>

26	Mr Mansfield's affidavit evidence was that he went to Mr Picone's office at
9.30 am on 9 September 1998 and asked for Mr Picone.
 He said that he was
informed by Amanda that Mr Picone would be out all day.  He claimed  that he
said to Amanda that he wanted to
see Mr Picone about the exchange of options
and that Amanda said <i>leave them with me and I'll have him phone you.</i>
<P>

27	Mr Picone gave evidence that although he was attending to a rather large
settlement on 8 September 1998 he was in the office
most of the day. He had a
meeting with a client outside the office on the 9 September 1998.  
<P>

28	When Mr Mansfield gave his oral evidence he said that he went to Mr Picone's
office on 8 September not 9 September 1998.  The
person referred to as Amanda
was called to give evidence.  Her name is Amanda Louise Brownrigg.  She denied
ever having a conversation
with Mr Mansfield in which she was alleged to have
asked him whether he could come into the office <i>the following morning</i>.
She said that she had no recollection of any of the other conversations alleged
by Mr Mansfield to have taken place.  She was firm
in her evidence that she has
never made an appointment for Mr Robert Picone that she can recall.  Although a
legal secretary at the
time she gave her oral evidence Ms Brownrigg was the
receptionist as at 8 September 1998.
<P>

29	Mr Mansfield maintained throughout his evidence that he understood that the
exchange of the options was to take place whilst
he was physically present.  He
claimed that notwithstanding Mr Picone's letter in which he requested the
return of the executed option
agreement<i> for</i> <i>exchange</i> he still
wanted to be present. 
<P>

30	The defendant also gave evidence that she understood that her husband, Mr
Mansfield, would be present at the exchange.
<P>

31	A conversation between Mr Mansfield and Mr Picone occurred on 11 September
1998.  Mr Mansfield's version of the conversation
is that he informed Mr Picone
that he couldn't attach a copy of the lease because the tenants had gone.  In
response to this Mr Mansfield
said that Mr Picone <i>told me that he would now
attend to exchange as stated in par 9 of his affidavit sworn 12 March
1999.</i>
<P>

32	Paragraph 9 of Mr Picone's affidavit of 12 March 1999 states that Mr
Mansfield said <i>you can disregard my letter regarding cl 14 as I see it has
already been deleted.  There is no tenant and the property will be sold
with
vacant possession.  </i>Mr Picone claimed that he said to Mr Mansfield <i>I'll
mark the contract accordingly and attend to exchange</i> to which Mr Mansfield
allegedly responded <i>OK.</i>
<P>

33	As to this last matter Mr Mansfield gave evidence that he did not say OK to
any such suggestion about exchange but he said <i>please get back to me ASAP to
arrange an appointment for exchange </i>to which he claims Mr Picone said <i>I
will.</i>
<P>

34	Although the plaintiff had executed the deed of option and returned it to Mr
Picone under cover of a letter dated 8 September
1998 Mr Picone did not have
final instructions from his client to exchange nor did he have instructions
from his client to issue
the cooling off certificate as required by the
legislation.
<P>

35	On 15 September 1998 Mr Picone obtained those instructions from his client
and attended to exchange in his office.  Prior to
doing so he made no further
contact with Mr Mansfield or the defendant. 
<P>

36	He gave evidence that at the time of the exchange of the contracts he
perused the deeds and executed the s 66ZF certificate in
duplicate and made a
comparison of both copies making sure they were identical.  He then  altered
the date from eighth September
to 15 September on the executed copy provided by
the defendant and made a file note of having exchanged the options. That file
note
<i>reads 15.9.98 10 mins exchange and amendments</i>.  Mr Picone then
forwarded the plaintiff's executed deed of option as described in par 6.11
above. The deed contained the s 66ZF
certificate signed by Mr Picone.
<P>

37	A further conversation of relevance is alleged to have occurred on 16
September 1998.  Mr Mansfield says that he telephoned Mr
Picone on that date
because he hadn't heard from him since 11 September 1998 about the exchange of
contracts.  He said to Mr Picone
<i>what's happening about the exchange</i> to
which he claimed Mr Picone said <i>everything's in hand.  You will hear from me
in a couple of days.</i>
<P>

38	Mr Picone claimed that on 16 September 1998 he said to Mr Mansfield <i>I
exchanged the options on 15 September.  We are sending your counterpart to you
in today's mail</i> to which he claimed Mr Mansfield said <i>OK</i>.  The file
note relied upon by Mr Picone in respect of this conversation reads <i>Strand
Estates <b>16/9/99</b> To Frank Mansfield - options exchanged <b>15/9/99</b>-
we sent option to him today- he said OK </i>(emphasis added).
<P>

39	Mr Picone was not cross examined about this file note which was attached to
his affidavit of 12 March 1999. No suggestion was
put to him that this file
note was not made on 16 September 1998 although it is curiously dated 16
September 1999 and refers to exchange
on 15 September 1999.
<P>

40	However Mr Mansfield denied that Mr Picone told him that he had exchanged
the option and he denied that he said that he had dated
it 15 September
1998.
<P>

41	The plaintiff submits the delivery of the executed Deed on 8 September 1998
to Mr Picone's office was in response to Mr Picone's
request in his letters of
1 and 4 September 1998 for it be returned to him <i>for exchange. </i>It is
important to note that these letters informed the defendant that <i>once
exchanged </i>the option fees would be forwarded to her. There would be no
reason to forward anything to the defendant if it was anticipated that
she (or
her agent) were to be present at the exchange.
<P>

42	The defendant submits that Mr Mansfield did not by delivery of the executed
option authorise such an exchange and that I should
not be satisfied that any
authorisation was given to Mr Picone to effect exchange in Mr Mansfield's
absence and certainly not as
agent for the defendant.
<P>

43	The evidence dealing with the understanding of the parties up to 17
September 1998 is in direct conflict. The plaintiff claims
that there was
authorisation for the exchange in Mr Mansfield's absence and the defendant
claims that exchange in Mr Mansfield's
presence was necessary.
<P>

44	The plaintiff submits that an analysis of the defendant's conduct between 17
September 1998 and the date of the purported rescission
supports the
plaintiff's claim that the exchange was authorised.
<P>

45	Mr Mansfield and the defendant gave evidence that they received the executed
deed of option on 17 September 1998 in the mail.
 Each claimed in evidence that
the only relevant s 52A document with the contract was the s 149 Certificate.
They each claimed that
they noticed this on 17 September 1998. Mr  Mansfield
claimed that he advised the defendant that the missing documents could be
provided
in the contract should the option be exercised. He said that the
defendant instructed him not to worry Mr Picone about it because
he (Mr Picone)
was such a busy man.
<P>

46	Quite a deal of evidence of conversation between the defendant and Mr
Mansfield was tendered in evidence and some of it was not
the subject of
objection. At no stage was there any suggestion that either Mr Mansfield or the
defendant said to each other or more
importantly to Mr Picone that they were
surprised or  annoyed that Mr Picone had exchanged the contracts in Mr
Mansfield's absence.
There is no evidence of any protest. Certainly there was
nothing preventing the defendant from making contact with Mr Picone to register
such a protest. It was not done. Mr Mansfield and the defendant banked the
$5,000 cheque and remained silent.
<P>

47	The defendant entered into the contract with Emesco in February 1999.
Correspondence with those representing Emesco, Minter Ellison
solicitors,
included the provision of a copy of the option. In his covering fax of 27
January 1999 Mr Mansfield stated <i>as requested copy of option with Strand
Estates Pty Ltd dated 15 September 1998 follows.</i> 
<P>

48	On 28 January 1999 Mr Mansfield forwarded a further fax to Minter Ellison in
which he said:
<P>

	<i>The deed of option WAS executed 15 September 1998.  Initially six months.
We are aware that the negotiations must remain confidential
and agree with your
comments in this regard.  Grantee COULD send a notice of extension of option to
purchase, with a further $5,000
prior to 14 March 1999 and the option period
would be extended a further six months.</i>
<P>

49	It is apparent there was some question about the date of exchange or grant
of the option because on 28 January 1999 Mr Mansfield
forwarded a further fax
to Minter Ellison in which he stated <i>letter from your colleague, Robert
Picone, Somerville &amp; Co confirms that the exchange of options with
Strand<b> </b>Estates Pty Ltd took place on 15 September last.</i>
<P>

50	Special conditions in the contract with Emesco also refer to the option as
follows;
<P>

	<i>33.1 The vendor discloses to the purchaser that it has granted an option to
purchase the property to (the plaintiff)..pursuant to
an agreement dated 15
September 1998.</i>
<P>

	<i>33.2 If (the plaintiff)..exercises the option on or before 14 March 1999
the vendor must within 2 business days of receipt of notice
of exercise of
Option notify the purchaser...and this contract will immediately come to an
end...</i>
<P>

51	These clauses recognise 15 September 1998 as the date of the grant of the
option in particular by reason of the choice of the
date until which the
plaintiff had to exercise the option, any extension aside.
<P>

52	There are two matters to which I need to make reference in weighing up the
parties different versions of events because they
are relied upon by each party
to attack the reliability of the evidence of the other or to suggest that less
weight would be given
to that evidence by me.
<P>

53	The plaintiff points to the defendant's <i>dogged adherence </i>in her
evidence and reliance upon Mr Mansfield's evidence of the claim that the s52A
documents were not attached to the option. It
submits that this adherence and
subsequent abandonment of such reliance as a ground for rescission is a
circumstance which should
cause me to have some doubt about the reliability of
the evidence of the defendant and Mr Mansfield generally.
<P>

54	The detail into which the defendant, but more particularly Mr Mansfield,
descended to convince me that the s52A documents were
not attached was minute.
I was told of clips, drawers, plastic sleeves, attendances upon the documents,
difficulties with clips,
the use of implements to remove clips, the replacement
of clips, the return of the plastic sleeves and the locking of drawers. I
heard
appropriately detailed cross examination of this process which took up the
better part of a day.
<P>

55	The abandonment of claims made during the course of litigation will not
always entitle a judge to view the evidence of the abandoning
party with
suspicion or to afford it less weight. It will depend upon the circumstances of
the case. In this case the abandonment
of the evidence relating to this aspect
of the matter with the explanation that the defendant accepted that she would
not be able
to establish that the documents were not attached convinces me that
I should place less weight on Mr Mansfield's evidence than I
otherwise would
have but for the abandonment.
<P>

56	The defendant on the other hand claims that the curious date on the file
note (16.9.99) will cause me to give its contents no
weight.
<P>

57	The date of the file note was not referred to by anyone prior to my raising
it with counsel in final addresses. Mr Picone attached
it to his affidavit of
12 March 1999 in support of his version of the conversation of 16 September
1998. He said it was a <i>contemporaneous file note.</i>
<P>

58	Mr McEwen SC submitted that no challenge had been made to the claim that it
was contemporaneous in Mr Picone's cross examination
and in the circumstances I
should accept that it was made on that day although curiously dated a year
later than the conversation
and six months later than the affidavit.
<P>

59	In oral submissions on 6 April 1999 Mr Cummins accepted that there had been
no cross examination of Mr Picone in respect of the
file note but pointed to Mr
Mansfield's denial that he had been told of the exchange the day before this
conversation. In his written
submission received on the afternoon of 8 April
1999 Mr Cummins submitted that the file note is <i>simply irrelevant having
regard to its date.</i> 
<P>

60	Mr Cummins further submitted that there was no impediment to the plaintiff
reopening its case to recall Mr Picone to <i>give the necessary evidence
regarding the typographical error so the file note can be treated as
contemporaneous. </i>He submitted that the defendant <i>supports and invites
that reopening.</i> Failing such an application by the plaintiff he submitted
<i>the file note should be disregarded.</i>
<P>

61	In the light of these submissions I had the matter relisted at 2 pm on 9
April 1999 when Mr McEwen SC advised the court there
would be no application by
the Plaintiff. I asked Mr Coyne, who appeared for the defendant on that day,
whether there was any application
by the defendant to further cross examine Mr
Picone. There was no application.
<P>

62	The date of the file note is curious and because this is so I do not intend
to rely upon the existence of the file note in weighing
up the competing
versions of the 16 September 1998 conversation. However I should say that
having regard to the way the evidence
has been left and the submission that I
should merely disregard it there is no inference adverse to Mr Picone and the
plaintiff drawn
in respect of the date of the note.
<P>

63	I invited the defendant to put any submissions or give any explanation as to
why Mr Picone would refuse to exchange the option
in Mr Mansfield's presence if
such a request was being pressed upon him. No explanation could be given. I
also issued the same invitation
as to why on 16 September 1998 Mr Picone would
not inform Mr Mansfield that he had exchanged the options the day before. No
explanation
could be given. Certainly there was no challenge to Mr Picone's
evidence that he did exchange the options on 15 September 1998.
<P>

64	Mr Picone's letters of 1 &amp; 4 September 1998 are in my opinion requests
for the defendant to allow Mr Picone to exchange the
contracts in the absence
of the defendant. If the defendant was to be present (personally or by her
agent) there would be no need
for the statement that the fees would be
forwarded after exchange.
<P>

65	I am satisfied that the delivery of the executed deed dated 8 September 1998
together with the covering letter from the defendant
was in response to Mr
Picone's letters.
<P>

66	I am satisfied that on 11 September 1998 Mr Picone informed Mr Mansfield
that he would<i> mark the contracts accordingly and</i> <i>attend to
exchange</i> and that Mr Mansfield did not ask Mr Picone to get back to him to
arrange an appointment for exchange. I am also satisfied Mr Picone
informed Mr
Mansfield on 16 September 1998 that the options had been exchanged. Mr Picone's
letter of that date does not refer to
the conversation between the two men.
That suggests to me that the letter had been prepared by the time the
conversation took place
and is supportive of Mr Picone's version that he told
Mr Mansfield that he was sending the document to the defendant that day.
<P>

67	The defendant's contract with Emesco has a purchase price of $165,000 more
than the purchase price agreed upon with the plaintiff.
This is pointed to by
the plaintiff as a motive in the defendant to suggest so long after the event
that Mr Picone was not authorised
to exchange the option. In this regard I am
presented with a similar situation to that which was presented to Lord
Sterndale in Koenigsblatt
v Sweet  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281923%29%202%20Ch%20314" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1923) 2 Ch 314</a> at 324 where His Lordship
said<i> the defendant wishes to get out of a contract which he undoubtedly made
and approved, because he could make more money by repudiating
it than by
fulfilling it.</i>
<P>

68	In all the circumstances I prefer the evidence of the plaintiff over that of
the defendant.
<P>

69	I am satisfied that the defendant authorised the plaintiff to exchange the
options on her behalf and to do all such things as
necessary to effect that
exchange. The conduct of the defendant in delivering an executed option to Mr
Picone in response to his
two letters and the conversation of 11 September 1998
gave him that authority.
<P>

70	This is not a case of telephone exchange or postal exchange in which there
is a need to assess by what act and when a concluded
and binding agreement is
reached.(Nunin Holdings v Tullamarine Estates Pty Ltd   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%201%20VR%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 1 VR 76</a> at
81-83;Domb v Isoz (1980) Ch at 548 at 557<b>; </b>Henderson v Hopkins
(unreported Young J 22/2/98).  In this case Mr Picone had implied actual
authority to act as the defendants agent
at exchange and upon the exchange the
binding agreement was concluded.
<P>

71	If I am wrong in respect of the implied actual authority given to Mr Picone
prior to exchange I am satisfied that the defendant
ratified that authority to
act as her agent on exchange by her conversations (through Mr Mansfield) and
conduct thereafter referred
to above.  ( Koenigsblatt v Sweet (1923) 2 Ch
31).
<P>

72	This is certainly not a case of mere silence being relied upon for such
ratification. It includes the positive conduct in taking
the benefit of the
option fees and banking them. It also includes the conversation of 16 September
1998 (see Empirnall Holdings v
Machon Paull  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20523" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 14 NSWLR 523)</a> and the
subsequent conduct outlined above. This ratification is subject to the option
not falling foul of s66ZG to which I shall
now refer.
<P>

	<b>The counterpart question</b>
<P>

73	Mr Cummins submits that even if I am satisfied that Mr Picone was authorised
to act as the defendant's agent for the purpose
of the exchange he was not
authorised to complete the blank s66ZF certificate within the deed of option
which the defendant had executed
and delivered to him on 8 September 1998. If
that is so he submits that the certificate should not have been filled out and
therefore
there would not be an exchange of counterparts as required by s66ZG
and the option is void.
<P>

74	Mr Cummins further submits that Mr Picone was not authorised to change the
date on the option executed by the defendant from
<i>eighth</i> September 1998
to 15 September 1998. In those circumstances the documents were not
counterparts.
<P>

75	As to the matter of the filling out of the certificate in the defendant's
executed option Mr Picone said that he did this prior
to the exchange. There is
no requirement for such a certificate to be given by the vendor to the
purchaser. The legislation requires
the purchaser to give it to the vendor to
remove the cooling off period.
<P>

76	Assuming that there was no need to complete the certificate - as it is of no
effect in the defendant's executed copy - I regard
it as superfluous and not
affecting the status of the option as a counterpart.
<P>

77	As to the changing of the date on the defendant's executed copy from eighth
to 15 I am of the opinion that Mr Picone was authorised
as agent to do such
things as necessary to effect a valid exchange which included the dating of the
defendant's copy as at the date
of exchange.  Mr Mansfield said in evidence
<i>I'm not worried about dates </i>(Tr.99 l 41). Although I am satisfied that
Mr Picone had the implied authority to attend to this change, in my opinion the
ratification
of Mr Picone's authority to exchange the option would also
encompass that change.
<P>

78	In the circumstances of Mr Picone being authorised to act as the defendant's
agent at exchange I am satisfied that he received
a counterpart of the option
as exchanged on 15 September 1998.
<P>

79	I am therefore satisfied that the option is not void under s66ZG(1)(a).
<P>

	<b>The grant question</b>
<P>

80	I am also satisfied that the option was <i>granted </i>on 15 September 1998.
An exchange of counterparts took place on that day and the defendant, by her
agent, Mr Picone, received the
counterpart that day. This much is effectively
recognised in the special conditions to the Emesco contract and the
pre-contractual
correspondence between the defendant and Emesco.
<P>

81	The timing of the grant is relevant to the submission that the option is
void because it was able to be exercised within 42 days
of its grant. This
would only be a valid argument if I had found that the option was granted after
15 September 1998.
<P>

82	I am therefore satisfied that the option is not void under s66ZG (1)(b).
<P>

	<b>Rescission pursuant to s66ZH</b>
<P>

83	A further question for decision is whether the defendant is entitled to
rescind the contract pursuant to s66ZH because she did
not receive a
certificate which complied with s66ZF at or before the time the option was
granted (see s66ZC).  If this was so then
the option should have included a
statement in relation to the cooling off period which it did not contain.
<P>

84	I have found the option was granted at the time of exchange of counterparts
with Mr Picone acting for the plaintiff and as agent
for the defendant. The
certificate was within the plaintiff's executed counterpart. The defendant
received the certificate at the
time of the exchange/grant by her agent  Mr
Picone. In those circumstances there is no cooling off period and no ground for
rescission
of the option under s66ZH.
<P>

85	If I had found for the defendant on this issue it would have meant that
notwithstanding that a valid option had been granted
a party which is given no
benefit by the certificate would have been entitled to rescind the option.
This seems unjust and inappropriate.
<P>

86	It is now over three years since Windeyer J suggested some reform to this
aspect of the law.  His Honour's suggestion was:
<P>

<b>	</b><i>At the very least the rights under s 66ZH(2) should be restricted to
the grantee, if only the grantee has rights.  </i>
<P>

	<i>Jillsea Pty Ltd v George &amp; Anor (Windeyer J unreported  6.10.95 at p
18)</i>
<P>

87	 If His Honour's suggestion were to be followed it seems to me that some
unjust outcomes may be avoided.  
<P>

	<b>Preparation of draft option by the plaintiff</b>
<P>

88	This defendant submits that because Mr Picone prepared the draft deed of
option she is entitled to rescind it. The submission
as I understand it is that
the legislation requires the grantor/vendor to prepare the deed of option. It
is submitted that this requirement
is found in s52A(2)(a) which provides that a
vendor, under a contract for the sale of land, shall, before the contract is
signed
by or on behalf of a purchaser attach the prescribed documents to the
contract.
<P>

89	Even assuming this to be correct in relation to such a contract it is
abundantly clear that the defendant's conduct authorised
Mr Picone to prepare
the draft deed on this occasion. The defendant negotiated changes to the draft
and at no stage suggested that
she should put together another draft so that
she could be the party to attach the prescribed documents.
<P>

90	Additionally when requested to disassemble the contract from the first draft
of the second option to attach the draft contract
for the sale of the property
to the amended draft she did so without demur.
<P>

91	This claim is unmeritorious and is not a proper ground to rescind the
option.
<P>

<b>	Estoppel</b>
<P>

92	Although this point is not necessary to decide because of my decision in
respect of the plaintiff's other claims similar considerations
to those
discussed above arise in respect of the plaintiff's claim that the defendant
should be estopped from denying that Mr Picone
was so authorised.
<P>

93	In my opinion the conduct of the defendant, knowing that the plaintiff was
expending funds and/or not negotiating further with
the defendant on the
understanding that it had a binding option agreement would establish a proper
basis for a finding that the defendant
should be estopped from so denying Mr
Picone's authority to exchange as the defendant's agent. 
<P>

<b>	Rectification</b>
<P>

94	 Mr Cummins submits that what the defendant received was not a deed which
unless rectified would be effective according to its
tenure, but a nullity
(Coolibah Pastoral Co v The Commonwealth  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%2011%20FLR%20173" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 11 FLR 173</a> per Blackburn J at
191).  Once again it is not necessary for me to decide whether rectification
could apply to the deed dated 15
September 1998 however the plaintiff's
argument that it is entitled to such a remedy seems to have some force.
<P>

95	Mr McEwen SC relied upon the defendant's evidence that there was no concern
about the date of the agreement, the fact that there
was consensus as to its
terms and each party desired to implement the agreement.
<P>

96	Additionally it seems both parties believed the option was granted on 15
September 1998 and the defendant entered into a contract
with the third party
effectively stating such to be the case.   
<P>

<b><i>	</i>Extension of second option</b>
<P>

97	In the circumstances of my findings in respect of the validity of the second
option I am satisfied that it has been validly extended
by the service of the
notice pursuant to clause 10 of the second option and the tender of the $5,000
under cover of Mr Picone's letter
of 4 March 1999.
<P>

<b><i>	</i>Conclusion</b>
<P>

98	I therefore find in favour of the plaintiff in respect of the claims it
makes in pars 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of its summons.  It is not
necessary for me to deal
with the order sought in par 6 as it seems to me to be premature.  However the
parties are to bring in short
minutes which will include the dismissal of the
cross claim.  I will hear counsel in respect of any application relating to
costs
but I am minded to make an order that the defendant pay the plaintiff's
costs  of this application. 
<P>
