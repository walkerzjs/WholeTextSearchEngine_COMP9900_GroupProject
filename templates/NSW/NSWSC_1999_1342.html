<br><br><b>IN THE SUPREME COURT</b><br><b>OF NEW SOUTH WALES</b><br><b>CRIMINAL
DIVISION</b><br><br><b>STUDDERT J</b><br></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<b>Thursday 25 November
1999</b></blockquote></blockquote><p><br><b>070031/99	REGINA   v   LMW</b></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
<b>JUDGMENT</b><p>
<b>(On admissibility of evidence of Dr Wotton)</b><p>
</blockquote></blockquote><p>1. HIS HONOUR:  Counsel raised a matter concerning
the admissibility of certain of the material covered in a report served by the
Crown upon the defence.  This was a report of Dr Wotton, psychiatrist, who
assessed the accused on behalf of the Crown.  In the course
of that discussion
the Crown indicated that endeavours would be made to obtain a supplementary
report but, in any event, I indicated
I would entertain an application for the
doctor&#8217;s evidence, or those parts the subject of concern, to be taken
first on the
voir dire.  That course was indeed followed yesterday and the
doctor was examined and cross-examined in the absence of the jury at
some
length.  Mr Zahra then called Dr Waters, a psychiatrist qualified in the case
for the defence.  </p>
<p><br>2. The focus of the objection taken to the evidence of Dr Wotton was the
following:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(i)	a passage of page 8 of his report:</p>
<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
&#8220;[LMW] now seemed to have dropped his guard, and was quite enthusiastic
when I asked him what sort of music he liked.  He told
me excitedly that he
liked &#8216;Two Pack - he died 2 years ago!&#8217;  I asked [LMW] how this had
happened.  He told me importantly:
 &#8216;He died in a drive-by shooting.  It
was a gang killing.  He bashed the hell out of another gang dude.&#8217;  I
asked [LMW]
how he had come by this information, and he told me that his sister
had told him.  He added &#8216;Me Mum&#8217;s boyfriend said
about Two Pack:
&#8220;He&#8217;s shit and he&#8217;s
dead!&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>
<p>(ii)	a passage on page 10 under the head &#8220;Spontaneous play&#8221;:</p>
<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
&#8220;The two figures that [LMW] had chosen to play with were both
fighting-action type figures.  One was a figure from &#8216;Star
Wars&#8217;,
the other was a heavily-muscled warrior.  [LMW] told me that one of the figures
was &#8216;Predator&#8217;.  I professed
ignorance about this.  [LMW] told me: 
&#8216;He&#8217;s invisible - he goes around killing everyone.&#8217;  He
engaged the two
figures in a fight, looked pleased as he did so.  I asked what
he liked about Predator.  [LMW] told me:  &#8216;I like the way he
killed him. 
The dude was laughing and then they had ten seconds to get away and then the
bomb went off!&#8217;</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
[LMW] continued engaging the two figures in a fight.  I asked him which one
would he choose to be.  He told me (pointing to &#8216;Predator&#8217;):

&#8216;This dude.  He can never be killed - he&#8217;s
invisible.&#8217;</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
[LMW] was staring at the figures, and seemed to have some realisation of what he
was saying.  He suddenly dropped the figures back
into the box.  I asked him if
what he had been playing had reminded him of something.  [LMW] told me &#8216;I
just put it away.&#8217;&#8221;</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>
<p>(iii)	a passage on page 13:</p>
<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
&#8220;This shows a large tiger springing into mid-air towards its intended prey
- a monkey.  [LMW] said in a sing-song way:  &#8216;He&#8217;s
goin to get a
monkey to eat...he&#8217;s hungry.&#8217;  I asked how the tiger would be
feeling.  [LMW] told me:  &#8216;Hungry!&#8217;
 I asked about the monkey. 
[LMW] put on a funny voice:  &#8216;What you doin&#8217; man?  You gonna eat
me?&#8217;  I asked how
the monkey would be feeling.  [LMW] told me:  &#8216;Sad
- because he will die.&#8217;&#8221;</blockquote></blockquote><p></p>
<p>(iv)	a further passage on page 13:</p>
<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
&#8220;This picture shows two adult bears asleep in a cave, with a younger bear
at the mouth of the cave, awake.  [LMW] said:  &#8216;Bears
in the cave
asleep.&#8217;  I asked if he could see anything else.  [LMW] looked again,
telling me that:  &#8216;There&#8217;s a
baby lying with its eyes open.&#8217; 
I asked what it might be able to see.  [LMW] told me that: &#8216;It might be
looking at an
animal or a human.&#8217;  I asked why a human would be coming
towards the cave.  [LMW] told me:  &#8216;For a bear skin.&#8217;
 I asked if
this meant the bear would be killed.  [LMW] said cautiously: 
&#8216;Probably.&#8217;&#8221;</blockquote></blockquote><p><br>3. Each of these
passages records events in the course of the doctor&#8217;s assessment that had
been prompted by measures taken by
the doctor in an endeavour to draw the
accused out.</p>
<p><br>4. The first passage appeared in the context of the doctor having asked
the accused about his sister and he told the doctor that the
sister let him
borrow her songs on CD and tape.  The second passage followed upon the child
reaching into a play box which the doctor
had available and selecting the two
figures from Star Wars.  The third and fourth passages appeared in the context
of the doctor
having provided for the child a series of cards used in what the
doctor described as a standard projective test administered to children.</p>
<p><br>5. As opposed to the tests conducted on behalf of the defence by Dr
Langeluddecke and commented upon by Dr Waters, what is recorded
in the passages
above set out relates essentially to subjective responses.  Dr Waters was
critical of the usefulness of these procedures
as compared with what he said in
effect were the generally accepted and reliable objective tests that Dr
Langeluddecke had carried
out.  However the criticisms by Dr Waters of the
probative value of the responses recorded by Dr Wotton would not, in my view,
alone
warrant the exclusion of the evidence contained in the passages, assuming
such evidence was otherwise relevant and probative.  It
seems to me that any
question of a disagreement between Dr Wotton and Dr Waters as to the usefulness
of testing could ordinarily
be left for a jury to determine. </p>
<p><br>6. However, yesterday, having considered the evidence and the submissions
of counsel, I determined that the evidence in the above
passages and any opinion
evidence that might otherwise be based upon it should be excluded and I now
state my reasons for the conclusion
I reached.</p>
<p><br>7. The objections taken to the evidence warranted careful consideration
of the relevance of the evidence, and assuming its relevance,
its probative
value, but on the other hand, assessment of the danger of unfair prejudice to
the accused in the event of its admission.</p>
<p><br>8. In the course of questioning yesterday, Dr Wotton gave the following
answer to the following question directed to the significance
of the matters
reported upon in passages (i) to (iv):</p>
<p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
&#8220;Q.	Do I understand then from the responses you have just given to
counsel, that those various tests which you conducted, and
the responses that he
gave, did not tell you anything about this issue of doli
incapax?</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
A.	Not really, no.&#8221;</blockquote></blockquote><p><br>9. Further, in his
evidence on the voir dire, Dr Wotton said that the evidence in passage (i) did
not assist him in forming any opinion
as to whether or not the accused&#8217;s
behaviour indicated some understanding of life and death.  In these
circumstances no basis
of relevance was established for the introduction of the
evidence and the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused is self-evident
from
the narrative of the accused&#8217;s behaviour and comments.  Hence, in my
opinion, s 137 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> required the exclusion of evidence
concerning passage (i).</p>
<p><br>10. As to each of the remaining three passages, Dr Wotton was of the
opinion that they indicated some understanding in the accused
of the meaning of
life and death.  To prove such an understanding would be relevant for the
jury&#8217;s consideration in the context
of determining whether the accused was
aware that what he was doing was seriously wrong.  On that issue, of course, the
Crown has
the onus of proof and evidence going to establish this element in the
Crown case is plainly admissible.</p>
<p><br>11. The difficulty, however, with the evidence is that the responses
which Dr Wotton recorded were all made some nineteen months or
more after the
event.  In that period not only had the accused grown older but much more
importantly he had undergone very unhappy
experiences resulting from the death
of the deceased.  He had experienced threats from those who obviously believed
he was responsible
for what had occurred, he had undergone the ordeal of
proceedings in the Children&#8217;s Court and he had been subject to much
attention
by the media.  My attention was drawn to this on the earlier
application for a permanent stay of proceedings.</p>
<p><br>12. In the light of events since 2 March 1998 and by reason of them, the
accused could well have developed an understanding of life
and death such as the
responses observed by Dr Wotton indicated.  It does not follow however that such
an understanding was present
on 2 March 1998.  The Crown looks to other evidence
to prove such understanding at the time that the deceased died.  That evidence
concerns the observed behaviour of the accused at the relevant time.</p>
<p><br>13. The responses recorded in the passages the subject of objection do
not afford any basis for assessment of the cognitive ability
of the accused. 
Those responses and the opinion which the doctor formed on the basis of them
that there was indicated some understanding
of life and death do not undermine
or go to the objective findings made by Dr Langeluddecke.</p>
<p><br>14. It seems to me that the introduction of the evidence referred to in
the three remaining passages and the opinion evidence which
Dr Wotton would have
been asked to give involved the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.  It
involved attention to the accused&#8217;s
reactions to death in a variety of
circumstances.  In my opinion the probative value of evidence based on the
passages would be outweighed
by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. 
In these circumstances s 137 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> was enlivened and
required the exclusion of this evidence.  Hence I so ruled.</p>
