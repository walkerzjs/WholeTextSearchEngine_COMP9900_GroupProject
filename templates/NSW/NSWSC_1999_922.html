<b><u>NO. 3056 OF 1995</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>EFG AUSTRALIA LIMITED &amp; ORS.  V.  KENNEDY &amp; ORS.</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	From 24th July 1989 to 2nd August 1995, the defendant Robert
David Phillips was employed by the second plaintiff EFG Treasury
Pty. Limited
(which I will call "EFG Treasury") to assist another employee David Ian Kennedy
in the management, on behalf of the
first plaintiff EFG Australia Limited
(which I will call "EFG"), of a joint venture development at Penrith known as
the Glenmore
Park joint venture.  That employment was peremptorily terminated
on 2nd August 1995 by John O'Grady, the Managing Director of EFG
and EFG
Treasury.  
<P>

2  	In these proceedings, the plaintiffs seek an account from Mr.
Phillips of certain payments and benefits received by him during
that
employment.  By a cross-claim, Mr. Phillips seeks damages for wrongful
dismissal.  
<P>

<b><u>OUTLINE OF FACTS</u></b>
<P>

3  	I will commence with an outline of facts not substantially in
dispute.  
<P>

4  	On 4th May 1989, EFG entered into a joint development agreement
with NSW Land &amp; Housing Corporation whereby the Corporation
agreed to form
a joint venture to develop 473 hectares of land known as Glenmore Park at
Penrith.  When fully developed, Glenmore
Park was to be a residential suburb,
comprising 4,500 residential allotments and also community facilities.  EFG
then proceeded to
provide development services to the joint venture by
contracting with a project manager.  Initially, with the Corporation's consent,
EFG appointed Glenmore Park Developments Pty. Limited as project manager.  That
company engaged Benjamin Chow, a town planner and
engineer, as a project
consultant to provide professional engineering services.  Another company,
Glenmore Park Realty Pty. Limited,
was engaged from about 1990 to market the
real estate of the joint venture.
<P>

5  	Glenmore Park Developments was initially controlled by a Mr.
Lowry and a Mr. Turnbull; but by about the middle of 1991, those
persons ceased
to be involved in the joint venture.  Their role was in substance taken over by
Mr. Chow; and by an agreement dated
6th March 1992, Sydney Subdivision Pty.
Limited, a company controlled by Mr. Chow, was appointed project manager in
place of Glenmore
Park Developments.  By about this time, Glenmore Park Realty
had also come to be controlled by Mr. Chow.  
<P>

6  	Mr. Kennedy was first employed by the plaintiffs on 15th February
1988, and was given the responsibility to manage overall the
development of the
joint venture on behalf of the plaintiffs.  Mr. Phillips was first employed by
the plaintiffs on 24th July 1989,
and he was made second in charge to Mr.
Kennedy.  Mr. Phillips' responsibilities included reviewing on behalf of the
plaintiffs tenders
and accounts in relation to engineering services submitted
by Mr. Chow.  
<P>

7  	The first transaction about which the plaintiffs complain was the
purchase of Lot 3145 Glenmore Park by Osaka Holdings Pty.
Limited (which I will
call "Osaka"), a company of which Mr. Phillips was a director and a one-third
owner.  A sales summary dated
4th May 1991 records the sale of that lot to
Osaka for $70,000.00, with a rebate of "5k", and "exchange upon DA approval".
On 3rd
June 1991, Mr. Kennedy sent a memorandum to the Department of Housing
recommending reductions in price inter alia for Lot 3145, from
$70,000.00 by a
rebate of $5,000.00, as it was "proving difficult to sell".  A further sales
summary dated 4th September 1991 records
the sale of this lot to Osaka for
$71,000.00, with a rebate of $6,000.00.  Osaka re-sold this land in February
1992 for $80,000.00.
 
<P>

8  	Meanwhile, an invoice dated 23rd September 1991 was sent by The
Urban Collaborative Design (a name used by Mr. Phillips) to
Benjamin M.T. Chow
&amp; Associates for $3,750.00, being for "Professional Consulting Services
from 1 June thru 30 August 1991".
 Mr. Phillips received payment of this sum
from Mr. Chow or an entity associated with him.  Further similar invoices were
sent dated
10th December 1991 (for $3,750.00, in respect of the period 1st
September to 30th November 1991), and 12th May 1992 (for $6,250.00
in respect
of the period 1st December 1991 to 30th April 1992); and those invoices were
also paid.  Mr. Phillips claims that these
invoices and payments were in
respect of professional work which he performed for Mr. Chow in his spare time.

<P>

9  	An invoice dated 27th August 1991 was sent from "Phillips
Racing", a name associated with go-kart racing organised by Mr. Phillips,
to
Glenmore Park Realty, for $1,961.50 for kart parts and other items.  This
invoice was paid by Glenmore Park Realty.  There were
further similar invoices
dated 24th January 1994 for $1,760.00, 20th July 1994 for $1,546.60, 7th
November 1994 for $1,924.50, and
8th November 1994 for $2,000.00.  These
invoices were also paid by Glenmore Park Realty.  According to Mr. Phillips,
these were payments
for sponsorship of go-kart racing and for associated
advertising benefits, which he had arranged with Mr. Chow.  There is a
photograph
and clothing in evidence showing display of the Glenmore Park name.

<P>

10  	The second land transaction about which the plaintiffs complain
was the purchase by Osaka of Lot 3208.  In a memorandum dated
5th November 1991
to the Department of Housing, Mr. Kennedy recommended that the price of Lot
3208 be reduced to $76,000.00, despite
a valuation report dated 31st October
1991 assessing its value at $80,000.00.  A sales advice dated 30th November
1991 recorded the
sale of this lot to Minion Holdings Pty. Limited for
$76,000.00.  It appears that this purchaser then sought a rebate of $4,500.00,
and on 16th December 1991, this was rejected by Mr. Kennedy.  A record dated
30th January 1992 shows the sale of this lot to Osaka
for $76,000.00, and a
settlement sheet dated 14th July 1992 shows that a rebate of $6,000.00 was
allowed off that price on settlement.
 By that time, Osaka had subdivided the
lot into two lots, and it appears that the sale of those two lots for
$98,950.00 was completed
at the same time.  
<P>

11  	A memorandum dated 12th October 1992 from Mr. Kennedy to Mr.
Phillips asserted as follows:
<P>

<b><cite>STAFF DEALINGS IN LAND PURCHASES GLENMORE PARK</cite></b>
<P>

<b><i>You are herein reminded of your duties as employees of Elders to fully
disclose any involvement you may have in transactions relating
to properties at
Glenmore Park and would advise that such disclosure must be in writing to me
and should be made available in relation
to any transaction either personally,
as a Director of any company or in relation to any relative.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>You are formally advised that any breach of the foregoing will necessity
(sic) notice being given to Head Office in Melbourne of such
breach so that
appropriate action can be taken.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Kindly confirm, in writing, acknowledgement of this memo.</i></b>
<P>

On the next day, Mr. Phillips responded confirming full and complete
understanding of the contents of that memorandum.  On the next
day, a further
memorandum from Mr. Phillips to Mr. Kennedy included the following:
<P>

<b><i>I wish to express my concern to you over this incident and the previous
Osaka one, both of which were obviously brought up to suggest
improper conduct
on behalf of myself and other employees of key Glenmore Park companys (sic).  I
personally am finding it increasingly
difficult to work in circumstances where
one has to continually justify the propriety of their business conduct.  I
would hope that
you can take steps to stop this petty and unwarranted comment
and criticism from continuing, so that myself and the other key people
within
the Glenmore Park team can continue to effectively advance this project to a
successful conclusion without wasting our time
on answering unwarranted
accusations.</i></b>
<P>

12  	An invoice dated 22nd March 1993 from The Urban Collaborative
Design to Glenmore Park Realty claimed "commission" totalling
$6,750.00.  It
shows a calculation of this amount, being $600.00 for "lots settled to date 8 x
$75" and $6,150.00 being "advance
on further settlements 82 x $75".  Further
similar invoices were sent or dated 16th June 1993 (for $9,000.00, as an
advance on 120
further settlements), 20th July 1994 (for $20,025.00, for 267
lots settled), 7th November 1994 (for $10,050.00, for 134 lots settled),
and
4th April 1995 (for $13,875.00, for 165 lots at Glenmore Park and 20 lots at
Mango Hill).  These invoices were paid.  Mr. Phillips
gave evidence that these
invoices were also for professional work performed for Mr. Chow in his spare
time, as before.  The method
of invoicing was as requested by Mr. Chow.
<P>

13  	On 19th October 1993, EFG Treasury and Mr. Phillips executed a
service agreement.  The relevant clauses of that agreement are
clauses 4.1,
4.3, 4.4 and 6.1.  Clause 4.1(a), (e) and (f) were in the following terms:
<P>

<b><i>4.1	The Executive shall as an employee of the Company:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(a)	act diligently and do the best of his ability, and show good faith to
the Company;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>...</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(e)	not at any time do anything negligently or fraudulently which
directly or indirectly may or may be liable to cause loss or damage
or to
impair the Company;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(f)	notify the Company of any information directly or indirectly relating
to any business opportunity relating to the assets of Foster's
which the
Executive becomes aware of during the course of his employment with the Company
as soon as practicable after becoming aware
of such information.</i></b>
<P>

"Foster's" is defined in the agreement to mean Foster's Brewing Group Limited
and related companies, and those related companies
include EFG and EFG
Treasury.  Clauses 4.3, 4.4 and 6.1(b) and (h) were in the following terms:
<P>

<b><i>4.3	The Executive shall disclose to the Company in writing prior to or at
the time of making any recommendation in relation to the
business of Foster's
if any proposed transaction in relation to the business of Foster's is a
transaction in which the Executive
has any interest, whether direct or
indirect, and if so, the nature of any such interest.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>4.4	During the continuance of his employment under this Agreement the
Executive shall not, except with prior written consent of the
Company be
directly or indirectly engaged or concerned in any other business, occupation
or undertaking provided that nothing in
this clause shall apply to or in
respect of the holding of shares in any company listed on any stock exchange
(being shares which
do not in the aggregate exceed five percent [5%] of the
total of the issued shares in that company).</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>6.1	The employment of the Executive may be terminated by the Company
forthwith and without notice if the Executive:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>...</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(b)	having acted in breach of any obligation owed by him to the Company
fails to remedy that breach within fourteen (14) days (or
such longer period as
may be specified by the Board after receiving a notice from the Company
requiring that the breach be rectified);</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>...</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(h)	is in the reasonable opinion of the Board guilty of negligence or
dishonesty or misconduct or incompetence.</i></b>
<P>

14  	According to Mr. O'Grady, Mr. Phillips reported to Mr. Kennedy.
Mr. Kennedy was the senior manager managing the joint venture
on behalf of EFG,
and he was authorised by EFG to do various things in connection with the joint
venture, including executing village
management agreements, supply contracts,
tender acceptances, works agreements, and (at least from 23rd June 1992)
contracts for the
sale of joint venture land.  It seems that Mr. Kennedy
reported directly to Mr. O'Grady.
<P>

15  	Also according to Mr. O'Grady, he was not told, prior to the
commencement of these proceedings, nor was his approval sought
or given, to the
effect that Mr. Phillips or any person or company associated with him was
receiving benefits beyond his salary in
connection with his employment; nor
that any company in which he was interested was purchasing lots at Glenmore
Park (although he
became aware of this matter shortly before the proceedings
were commenced).  
<P>

16  	In about May or June 1995, Mr. O'Grady received information
suggesting Mr. Phillips had breached his duties to the plaintiffs
in relation
to the joint venture.  He engaged a private investigator to look into the
matter.  The information which ultimately led
to the dismissal of Mr. Phillips
on 2nd August 1995 became known to Mr. O'Grady progressively from about late
June 1995 and through
July 1995.  At that stage, the information was limited to
the Osaka transactions.  
<P>

17  	On 10th July 1995, Mr. O'Grady signed a letter approving a pay
increase for Mr. Phillips.  That letter was in the following
terms:
<P>

<b><i>On behalf of EFT Treasury Pty. Ltd. and Foster's Brewing Group I would
like to thank you for your contribution to our successful operation
during the
last  financial year.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>I am pleased to advise you that with effect from 1 July 1995 your Total
Remuneration has been increased by $4,197 to $109,120 per
annum.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Your remuneration increase will be processed in the August
payroll.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>In common with other parts of the Foster's Group, not all EFG employees
will receive a pay increase.  It is therefore imperative that,
as in all
employment and remuneration matters, you do not discuss this matter with other
employees.</i></b>
<P>

At the time he signed that letter, Mr. O'Grady was aware that serious
allegations had been made against Mr. Phillips, and that they
were being
investigated.
<P>

18  	The events immediately leading up to the dismissal were
described as follows by Mr. O'Grady, in an affidavit sworn by him:
<P>

<b><i>2.	In 1995, the Board of the Second Plaintiff, EFT Treasury Pty. Limited,
consisted of myself and Mr. Bruce Elliott.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>3.	On 31 July 1995 at 11.00am I called a meeting attended by Bruce
Elliott, a Director of the Second Plaintiff, Brian Russell, the
Company
Secretary of the Second Plaintiff and David Neufeld, the Chief Financial
Officer of the Second Plaintiff.  That meeting was
held at 333 Collins Street,
Melbourne on Level 19.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>4.	The purpose of the 31 July 1995 meeting was for myself and Brian
Russell to appraise Bruce Elliott and David Neufeld of the results
of
investigations into the management of the Glenmore Park joint venture, to
discuss court action which was proposed, and to discuss
a proposal that the
employment of David Kennedy and Robert Phillips by the Plaintiffs be
terminated.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>5.	At the meeting I said words to the effect:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>"On my instructions investigations have been undertaken by Peter Spence
into the conduct of the Glenmore Park joint venture and statements
have been
obtained by him in the course of those investigations."</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>6.	I informed those at the meeting of the results of Mr. Spence's
investigations and summarised the contents of the statements he
had obtained.
I am now unable to recall the detail of what I said about all the statements
but in relation to the information concerning
Mr. Phillips, I said words to the
following effect:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>"Peter Spence has obtained a statement from a person connected with the
joint venture who has said that he made payments to Bob Phillips
in connection
with the Glenmore Park joint venture and that Bob Phillips through a company
known as Osaka Holdings Pty. Ltd had been
involved in purchasing lots of land
at Glenmore Park for resale at a profit to builders.  There is a suggestion
that Bob Phillips
has had work performed on his home at very good rates by
builders who are purchasing lots at Glenmore Park.  Peter Spence had confirmed
Osaka Holdings Pty. Ltd. had purchased lots at Glenmore Park and Bob Phillips
was a director of that company."</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>7.	In the course of the discussion concerning Mr. Phillips I said words
to the following effect:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>"Bob Phillips did not disclose to EFG his dealings at Glenmore
Park"</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>8.	At the conclusion of the discussion, Mr. Bruce Elliott, Brian Russell
and David Neufeld said they agreed with the proposal to terminate
Mr. Kennedy's
employment, terminate the employment of Mr. Phillips' and to proceed with the
court action proposed.</i></b>
<P>

19  	On 2nd August 1995, without prior notice, EFG Treasury dismissed
Mr. Phillips.  Mr. O'Grady handed Mr. Phillips and said words
to the effect
"Your employment is terminated forthwith".  The letter was in the following
terms:
<P>

<b><i>1.	I hereby give you formal notice of the immediate termination of your
employment under the Service Agreement dated 19 October 1993
on the grounds of
serious misconduct.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>2.	Details of your termination payment are enclosed, together with a
cheque from the employer company, EFG Treasury Pty. Limited.
 The termination
payment includes five weeks pay in lieu of notice plus holiday pay up to and
including today.  The payment is made
in accordance with the Industrial
Relations legislation.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>3.	Under the circumstances, you have forfeited your entitlement to the
redundancy payment, as set out in the Company's letter dated
19 October 1993.
Notice of termination of your employment will be forwarded to the
administrators of the Foster's Brewing Group Superannuation
Fund shortly, and
they will contact you direct regarding your superannuation payout.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>4.	The following are to be handed to me (or my nominee)
forthwith:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Keys to the West Ryde office.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Keys to filing cabinets and desk drawers at the West Ryde
office.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Keys to motor vehicle Registration No. QJQ 587</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Details of the location of the above vehicle so that it can be
collected.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>American Express Card No. 3760 209281 12006.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>BP Petrol Card No. 5211</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Shell Petrol Card No. 1318</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Any documents or records of EFT Australia Limited and/or its subsidiaries
which are in your possession or under your control.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Any documents or records of the Glenmore Park Joint Venture development
which are in your possession or under your control</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>5.	Suffice to say that your actions are viewed with disappointment and
regret, EFG proposes to conduct a comprehensive review of the
operations of the
Glenmore Park Joint Venture development following which decisions will be made
regarding further legal proceedings.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

20  	Mr. Phillips was for a time unable to obtain other employment,
and subsequently he obtained employment for a lower remuneration.
 If I find
that Mr. Phillips is entitled to damages, the detailed calculation of those
damages will be left to a further enquiry.
<P>

<b><u>ISSUES</u></b>
<P>

21  	The first issue to be considered is whether Mr. Phillips owed
fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs.  Paragraph 18 of the Second
Further Amended
Statement of Claim alleges as follows:
<P>

<b><i>18.	Further, at all relevant times since his employment commenced on 24
July 1989:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(a)	Phillips owed to the plaintiffs or alternatively the first and second
plaintiffs fiduciary duties as follows:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(i)	to act honestly, diligently and in the best interests of his employer
in carrying out his duties;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(ii)	not to take advantage of his position to obtain any benefit for
himself or his associates.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(b)	Phillips owed duties to the plaintiffs or alternatively the first and
second plaintiffs as part of his contract of employment
in terms of 17(a) and
18(a) above.</i></b>
<P>

Paragraph 4 of Mr. Phillips' Amended Defence admitted paragraph 18, but then
continued "but does not admit that his duty was as
a 'fiduciary'".  
<P>

22  	Next, there is the question whether Mr. Phillips procured
financial benefits for himself and for Osaka during the course of
his
employment.  The allegation to that effect in paragraph 20 the Statement of
Claim is denied, but it is plain that the denial
is directed to the words
"during the course of his employment", so that this question really merges with
the next one.  
<P>

23  	Thirdly, there is the question whether Mr. Phillips breached any
duty to the plaintiffs.  Paragraphs 20A-20C of the Second
Amended Statement of
Claim are in the following terms:
<P>

<b><i>20A	The conduct referred to in paragraph 20 above and the benefits gained
by Phillips referred to in paragraph 20 above were not disclosed
to the
plaintiffs by Phillips.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>20B.	The conduct of Phillips referred to in paragraph 20 above was
dishonest and improper or engaged in by him recklessly as regards
to whether or
not it was honest or proper.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>20C.	By reason of the matters referred to in paragraphs 20 to 20B above
Phillips engaged in conduct which was in breach of the duties
referred to in
paragraph 17(a) and 18 above.</i></b>
<P>

Those paragraphs are denied in the Defence.  There is no express pleading
alleging informed consent by the plaintiffs to Mr. Phillips'
conduct.  At the
end of submissions, following a suggestion by me, Mr. Ellison for Mr. Phillips
applied to amend the Defence to raise
informed consent.  That was opposed by
Mr. Burnside QC for the plaintiffs.  However, I consider that the case was
conducted on the
basis that informed consent was a live issue, and I am
prepared to allow the Defence to be amended so that that issue is explicitly
raised.
<P>

24  	I should also mention that an application was made at the same
time to raise waiver as a defence, the alleged waiver being
the letter of 10th
July 1995 referred to above.  That application was also opposed by Mr.
Burnside.  I indicated a tentative view
that I would not permit that amendment,
as I did not consider the case had been conducted on the basis that there was
any question
of waiver.  I indicated tentatively that I accepted Mr. Burnside's
submission that had waiver been expressly raised, the plaintiffs
would have
devoted more attention to Mr. O'Grady's knowledge and intentions in signing the
letter.  I adhere now to that tentative
view.  I would add that it seems in any
event extremely unlikely that Mr. Phillips could rely on waiver:  it is not
shown that Mr.
O'Grady had full knowledge at the time of signing the letter
even of the Osaka transactions, and it seems clear that he had no knowledge
at
the time of the other transactions complained of.  
<P>

25  	Next, if there was a breach of duty, there is the question of
the appropriate remedy to which the plaintiffs may be entitled.
 
<P>

26  	Then, on Mr. Phillips' Cross-claim, there is the question
whether EFG Treasury was entitled to terminate the employment, either
under
general law, or pursuant to cl.6.1(b) and/or (h) of the service agreement.  I
note that the pleading also referred to par.(f)
of cl.6.1, but that was not
relied on.
<P>

27  	Finally, if EFG Treasury was not entitled to terminate the
employment, it will be necessary to make some findings as to the
basis on which
damages would be calculated.
<P>

28  	There are some factual questions within these issues, especially
in relation to the question of whether Mr. Phillips breached
any duty to the
plaintiffs.  I will consider those factual questions as I consider the relevant
issues.
<P>

29  	Accordingly, I will deal with the matter under three topics:
first, the nature of Mr. Phillips' duty; second, was there any
breach of that
duty, and if so, what remedy is the plaintiff entitled to; and third, was EFG
Treasury entitled to terminate the employment,
and if not, on what basis should
damages be calculated.  
<P>

<b><u>THE NATURE OF MR. PHILLIPS' DUTY</u></b>
<P>

30  	Although the relationship of employer and employee is generally
said to be a fiduciary relationship, it seems that the fiduciary
obligations of
junior or "ordinary" employees are narrower than those of senior employees, and
indeed that in many respects ordinary
employees are not fiduciaries at all:
see Austin, "Fiduciary Accountability for Business Opportunities" in Finn,
<u>Equity and Commercial Relationships</u> (Sydney LBC 1987) at p.171-2;
<u>State Rail Authority of New South Wales v. Earthline Constructions Pty.
Limited</u> (O'Keefe, CJ Comm.D., Supreme Court of New South Wales, 14/9/94);
<u>Colour Control Centre Pty. Limited v. Ty</u> (Santow, J, Supreme Court of
New South Wales, 24/7/95).  
<P>

31  	However, in <u>State Rail Authority</u> at p.52, O'Keefe, CJ
Comm.D. said this:
<P>

<b><i>Those duties of an employee which are normally characterised as fiduciary
relevantly include:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(i)	to act honestly in the service of the employer.  This is sometimes
expressed as a duty of loyalty or good faith and in appropriate
cases survives
the termination of the employment.  Breaches of this duty include the taking of
bribes or secret commissions or acting
in one's own interests or the interests
of another rather than in the interests of the employer;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(ii)	not to benefit him or herself to the detriment of the
employer;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(iii)	to treat confidential information as such and not disclose it to
competitors.</i></b>
<P>

This was quoted with approval by Santow, J. in <u>Colour Control Centre</u> at
p.17.
<P>

32  	Mr. Phillips was a quite senior employee of the plaintiffs,
being the second in charge of managing a very large project.  In
my opinion, he
had fiduciary duties at least to the extent set out in the passage quoted
above.  The written agreement of 19th October
1993 reinforces this view, at
least in relation to the period following its date.
<P>

<b><u>WAS THAT DUTY BREACHED?</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>Submissions</u></b>
<P>

33  	Mr. Burnside QC for the plaintiffs referred to Mr. Phillips'
evidence that the first three invoices were for work unrelated
to Glenmore
Park, including designing a duplex at Alfreds Point, two housing schemes at
Kariong, landscape work, Narellan Exhibition
Homes, and planning and use of
land at East Gosford, Bayview and Penrith Lakes; and that the remaining
invoices were also for work
performed for Mr. Chow, not being work associated
with the plaintiffs.  Mr. Burnside submitted that these explanations should be
rejected:  no documents were produced evidencing the work allegedly performed;
and in relation to the later invoices, there was no
proper explanation for the
invoices being addressed to Glenmore Park Realty, for the services being
described commissions on lot
sales, or for why Mr. Chow wanted invoices which
were admittedly false.  The only reasonable conclusion were that the payments
were
made to Mr. Phillips by virtue of his office and in connection with his
duties in relation to Glenmore Park.  
<P>

34  	Mr. Burnside next submitted that the purchases and re-sales by
Osaka involved a clear breach of fiduciary duty.  The only defence
suggested
was that Mr. Kennedy was aware of the purchases and had not objected to them.
In fact the evidence did not demonstrate
that Mr. Kennedy was aware of the
transactions.
<P>

35  	Similarly, in relation to the sponsorship of go-kart racing,
there was no suggestion that the promotional value of the sponsorship
justified
these payments:  the only inference that could be drawn was that the payments
were received by reason of Mr. Phillips'
position in relation to the joint
venture and in order to place him under an obligation to Mr. Chow.  
<P>

36  	Mr. Burnside submitted that Mr. Phillips was accordingly obliged
to account for these benefits, as being obtained where there
was a conflict or
possible conflict between his fiduciary duty and his personal interest, or by
reason of his fiduciary position.
 This liability did not depend on evidence of
detriment to the plaintiffs, or even upon dishonesty or lack of bona fides:

CLR 373</a> at 394.
<P>

37  	In so far as Mr. Kennedy sought to rely on informed consent, on
any view the level of disclosure concerning the payments to
Mr. Chow and the
Osaka transactions were insufficient.  I should accept Mr. O'Grady's evidence
that Mr. Kennedy had power to reject
consent for transactions involving a
conflict of interests, but not to approve them.  There was no evidence from Mr.
Phillips that
he believed Mr. Kennedy had authority or relied on any such
belief, or as to any grounds which could support such a belief.  
<P>

38  	Mr. Ellison for Mr. Phillips submitted first that, in relation
to the sponsorship for go-kart racing, Mr. Chow was entitled
to spend money on
advertising, and it could not be misconduct on the part of Mr. Phillips that he
agreed to spend it in part through
an entity associated with Mr. Phillips.  
<P>

39  	As regards the Osaka transactions, Mr. Ellison submitted that
these transactions were known to Mr. Kennedy, who had all actual
and implied
authority to approve of them.  Mr. Kennedy was a senior executive.  His
knowledge and authority was confirmed by the
memoranda of October 1992.  
<P>

40  	As regards the invoices to and payments by Mr. Chow, there was
no indication that Mr. Phillips absented himself from his duties
and
obligations to the joint venture.  Mr. Chow was entitled to use the skills and
talents of Mr. Phillips in a manner that both
saw appropriate, so long as there
was no conflict.
<P>

41  	Mr. Ellison pointed out that Mr. Phillips was not cross-examined
on his assertions that his work for Mr. Chow had nothing to
do with the
Glenmore Park project, or, in relation to the later invoices, that it was Mr.
Chow who established and continued this
particular regime.  Although Mr.
Phillips' employment was full-time employment, this did not prevent him working
in his spare time.
 Mr. Ellison submitted that I should infer that the evidence
from Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Chow would not have assisted the plaintiffs.
 It was
never put to Mr. Phillips that the payments from Mr. Chow were a reward for
favouring Mr. Chow in relation to his tenders
and accounts.  
<P>

<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

42  	In my opinion, the suggestion that the payments by Mr. Chow to
Mr. Phillips were connected with his employment by the plaintiffs,
and with his
dealings with Mr. Chow in relation to the Glenmore Park project, was
sufficiently raised and put to Mr. Phillips in
cross-examination.  The
Statement of Claim alleged that the payments were dishonest and improper, or
else reckless.  The cross-examination
suggested that Mr. Phillips did no work
apart from his work connected to Glenmore Park which justified the payments.
Mr.  Phillips
was questioned in relation to the later invoices, which Mr.
Phillips admitted, after some prevarication, were deliberately false.
 It was
put to Mr. Phillips that his job included reviewing Mr. Chow's construction
tenders and his monthly accounts.  
<P>

43  	Although I am not affirmatively satisfied that Mr. Phillips did
no work for Mr. Chow outside his duties in connection with
Glenmore Park
project, and while I accept Mr. Phillips' evidence that he would charge his
time for such work as he may have done
at $100.00 per hour, I am affirmatively
satisfied that the performance of any such work was not the substantial reason
or basis for
the payments made by Mr. Chow to Mr. Phillips.  
<P>

44  	In coming to this view, I rely on the circumstance that Mr.
Phillips was unable to produce any records or documents which evidenced
such
work for Mr. Chow, and gave no satisfactory explanation for the complete
absence of such records or documents.  In my opinion,
in relation to this
matter it was for Mr. Phillips to call Mr. Chow or to subpoena Mr. Chow to
produce documents evidencing such
work; and Mr. Phillips' failure to do so in
my opinion suggests that those steps would not have assisted Mr. Phillips'
case.  The
preparation of deliberately false invoices further supports the
conclusion I have reached.  I note that Mr. Phillips gave evidence
to the
effect that Mr. Chow said "rather than try and maintain precise records, he
would pay (Mr. Phillips) a reasonable amount for
(his) services"; but in my
opinion this evidence further confirms that the payments were not in substance
related to or based upon
work done by Mr. Phillips for Mr. Chow unconnected
with the Glenmore Park project.  My conclusion is also supported by Mr.
Phillips
asserting that the receipt of these payments did not create any
conflict of interests, because the issues with Mr. Chow were entirely
separate:
in the absence of further explanation, it is difficult to see how Mr. Phillips
could honestly hold such an opinion.  
<P>

45  	I accept Mr. O'Grady's evidence that he knew nothing of the
payments by Mr. Chow, and also his evidence that Mr. Kennedy did
not have the
plaintiffs' authority to approve of transactions involving a conflict of
interest.  
<P>

46  	In support of a defence of informed consent, Mr. Phillips gave
evidence that his work for Mr. Chow was openly discussed in
the presence of Mr.
Kennedy; although he accepted that he did not tell Mr. Kennedy that he was
getting something like $1,250.00,
and later $2,000.00, per month, or that Mr.
Chow had asked for false invoices.  In my opinion, this could not amount to
informed
consent by the plaintiffs.  Mr. Kennedy was not sufficiently informed
about the matter.  He did not have any actual authority to
give consent on
behalf of the plaintiffs.  There is no evidence from Mr. Phillips that he
believed Mr. Kennedy had such authority.
 There is no evidence of any
reasonable grounds for any such belief, such as might support a case of
ostensible authority.
<P>

47  	In those circumstances, in my opinion the receipt of the
payments from Mr. Chow did involve breaches of Mr. Phillips' fiduciary
duties.
In my opinion, Mr. Phillips is now bound to account to the plaintiffs for those
payments, with interest from the time of
their receipt.  In my opinion, no
basis is shown for any "just allowance" deduction from those payments:  the
evidence about work
performed by Mr. Phillips which might in part justify the
payments is too tenuous.  
<P>

48  	As regards the Osaka transactions, in my opinion there was a
clear conflict of interest in relation to those transactions,
and that in such
transactions, Mr. Phillips benefited himself to the detriment of the
plaintiffs.  In my opinion, Mr. Phillips is
obliged to account to the
plaintiffs for one-third of the profit made in each of those transactions.  In
relation to Lot 3208, this
was subdivided before re-sale, and there is some
evidence that Mr. Phillips did professional work in relation to that
subdivision.
 On that matter, I would make provision for just allowances.
Otherwise, the plaintiffs are entitled to the whole of the one-third
of the
profits, plus interest.
<P>

49  	As regards the go-kart sponsorship, this seems to me to be a
borderline case.  The evidence does not suggest any monetary profit
by Mr.
Phillips, but rather that certain expenses associated with go-kart racing
involving his son were paid by Glenmore Park Realty.
 It seems also that the
Glenmore Park project received the benefit of some publicity from this
sponsorship.  Ultimately, having regard
to the smallness of the amounts
involved, the difficulty of assessing just allowances, and the borderline
nature of the conflict
of interest, I am not satisfied that relief is justified
in relation to these transactions.
<P>

<b><u>WAS THE DISMISSAL WRONGFUL?</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>Submissions</u></b>
<P>

50  	Mr. Ellison submitted that the service agreement should be
construed contra proferentem, and that, even if there were some
conduct by Mr.
Phillips that might justify dismissal, the plaintiffs had to give Mr. Phillips
the opportunity to rectify the situation
contemplated by cl.6.1(b):  see
<u>Nissho Iwai Australia Limited v. Malaysian International Shipping
Corporation</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2012%20NSWLR%20731" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 12 NSWLR 731</a>; <u>Darlington Futures Limited v. Delco

agreement leading to dismissal had to be strictly complied with:

<P>

51  	The burden of proving justification for dismissal was on the
plaintiffs:  <u>Blyth Chemicals Limited v. Bushnell Limited</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1933/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1933] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281933%29%2049%20CLR%2066" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1933) 49 CLR
66</a> at 67.  In any event, Mr. Phillips was not in breach of his duties to the
plaintiffs in working for Mr. Chow in his spare time: 
see <u>Cementaid (NSW)
Pty. Limited v. Chambers</u>, Spender, J., Federal Court of Australia, 29/3/95.

<P>

52  	Mr. Ellison further submitted that the plaintiffs were obliged
to afford natural justice:  see Macken McCarry &amp; Sappideen,
<u>The Law of
Employment</u>, 4th Ed., 1997, footnote 180.  Mr. Ellison also referred me to
<u>North v. Television Corporation Limited</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%2011%20ALR%20599" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 11 ALR 599</a> at 609;

<P>

53  	At common law, Mr. Phillips was entitled to reasonable notice:

<P>

54  	Mr. Burnside submitted that the termination was justified by
cl.6.1(h):  the members of the Board of EFG Treasury formed the
reasonable
opinion that Mr. Phillips was guilty of misconduct.  There was no need for a
formal Board meeting:  see <u>Roden v. International Gas Applications</u>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2018%20ACSR%20454" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 18 ACSR 454</a> at 456; <u>Atkins v. St. Barbara Mines Limited</u> (1996) 22

<P>

55  	In any event, Mr. Phillips' conduct amounted to a repudiation
justifying immediate dismissal.  It did not matter that, at the
time of the
dismissal, the plaintiffs were not aware of the whole of the conduct, and in
particular not aware of the payments by
Mr. Chow:  <u>Boston Deep Sea Fishing
&amp; Ice Company v. Ansell</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281888%29%2039%20ChD%20339" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1888) 39 Ch.D. 339.</a>  
<P>

<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

56  	In my opinion, the conduct of Mr. Phillips, including both the
Osaka transactions and the payments from Mr. Chow, although
the latter was not
known at the time, was sufficient to amount to repudiation of his employment
contract and to justify immediate
dismissal:  <u>Boston Deep Sea Fishing</u>.
As Cotton, LJ said in that case, at 357:
<P>

<b><i>Where an agent entering into a contract on behalf of his principal, and
without the knowledge or assent of that principal, receives
money from the
person with whom he is dealing, he is doing a wrongful act, he is misconducting
himself as regards his agency, and,
in my opinion, that gives to his employer,
whether a company or individual, and whether the agent be a servant, or a
managing director,
power and authority to dismiss him from his employment as a
person who by that act is shewn (sic) to be incompetent of faithfully
discharging his duty to his principal.</i></b>
<P>

In the same case, at 363-4, Bowen, LJ said this:
<P>

<b><i>Now, there can be no question that an agent employed by a principal or
master to do business with another, who, unknown to that principal
or master,
takes from that other person a profit arising out of the business which he is
employed to transact, is doing a wrongful
act inconsistent with his duty
towards his master, and the continuance of confidence between them.  He does
the wrongful act whether
such profit be given to him in return for services
which he actually performs for the third party, or whether it be given to him
for his supposed influence, or whether it be given to him on any other ground
at all; if it is a profit which arises out of the transaction,
it belongs to
his master, and the agent or servant has no right to take it, or keep it, or
bargain for it, or to receive it without
bargain, unless his master knows
it.</i></b>
<P>

57  	If Mr. Phillips' conduct had not amounted to repudiation, then I
am inclined to think that instant dismissal was not justified
by the contract.
While I would not be prepared to imply the notice requirements of cl.6.1(b)
into cl.6.1(h), I am inclined to think
that "reasonable opinion" in cl.6.1(h)
means an opinion arrived at reasonably, as well as reasonably based on
available material.
 In most cases, this would require natural justice to be
afforded.  
<P>

58  	However, Mr. Phillips has now had a full opportunity to explain
the payments, and for the reasons I have given, has not done
so satisfactorily.
The facts as I have found them would certainly support a reasonable opinion
justifying dismissal.  Accordingly,
even if the conduct did not amount to
repudiation, in my opinion Mr. Phillips would be entitled to damages only in
respect of a short
period during which natural justice might have been afforded
to him.  
<P>

59  	However that may be, for the reasons I have given, the
cross-claim must fail.  
<P>

<b><u>CONCLUSION</u></b>
<P>

60  	It would appear unnecessary to have any further hearing
concerning the amount to be paid by Mr. Phillips, except possibly in
relation
to the question of just allowances in relation to the subdivision of Lot 3208.
Mr. Phillips' share of the profit on this
lot (leaving aside expenses) was
$9,650.00, while his share of the profit on Lot 3145 (leaving aside expenses)
was $5,000.00.  It
should be possible to agree on a figure for just allowances:
any difference could not justify the expense of an enquiry.
<P>

61  	The cross-claim will be dismissed, and I see no reason why Mr.
Phillips should not pay the plaintiffs' costs of the proceedings
properly
referable to the claims against and by him.
