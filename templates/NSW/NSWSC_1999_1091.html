<P>

<b>DAILY EXAMINER PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

<i>(Defendant)</i></center>
<P>


<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Claim for damages - closure of business)</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  The objective of the orders I propose to make
is to oblige the plaintiff to identify precisely the nature of her
damages
claim, it having been abandoned as a claim for "<i>special damages"</i>.
<P>

2   	Insofar as the plaintiff is making a claim, that it is
characterised as one, whilst not a claim for special damages, is either
what is
known as an Andrews claim, or otherwise can be characterised as a claim
entitling the plaintiff in some way to an award of
damages, or in some way to
have included in her damages a component consequent upon the closure of her
business as has been asserted,
then the plaintiff is to provide the particulars
referred to in paragraph 2 of the memorandum prepared by counsel for the
defendant,
and to give discovery in accordance with paragraph 4.    The
plaintiff is to take those steps by 4pm on Wednesday 17 November 1999,
and the
matter will be listed for directions on 19 November 1999.
<P>

3   	Having said that, it is to be noted that in the amended
statement of claim filed on 7 November 1997, in paragraph 5 there is
what is
described as a claim for "<i>A general loss of business and custom not yet
ascertained</i>" and a claim for "<i>Special damages</i>" as set out in
subparagraph (b) of paragraph 5 of that pleading.
<P>

4   	By reason of that formulation having been contained
effectively in the originating process filed on 24 December 1996, reference
can
be had to the correspondence in relation to particulars from the defendant
dated 10 February 1997 and the plaintiff dated 20
February 1997.  Paragraph 6
of the first letter is in the usual terms as a request for particulars in
relation to a claim for general
damages, or a claim by way of a reduction of
earning opportunity or other economic loss.  The response identifies a general
loss
of business or custom, and defers the particularisation of the matters to
found it (see<b> <i>Norris &amp; Anor v Illawarra Newspaper Pty Limited</i></b>
Levine J 16 December 1994).
<P>

5   	On 21 September 1999 the solicitors for the plaintiff
informed the solicitors for the defendant that there was no claim for
special
damages.  On 2 November this year the solicitors for the defendant sought
clarification of the nature of the plaintiff's
claim and it was met with the
response in a letter dated 2 November 1999:
<P>

<i>"As we have stated before, the particulars provided by our client of her
general damages and her discovery on this issue are complete.
 There is no
more.  Subsequent to the  defamation, our client's business failed and was
closed. These are the particulars; you have
been forewarned."</i>
<P>

6   	Two pages of a costs journal have been discovered, the
relationship of which to any claim frankly escapes me.  It was the defendant's
fundamental application to have whatever the claim was the plaintiff was
purporting to make, struck out.  I would have been dangerously
close to being
inclined to accommodate the defendant.  It is a drastic step to strike out a
claim for damages, even if a view is
open that the particularisation at the
time of the application is hopelessly inadequate.  But as has been
acknowledged, it is ever
available to a litigant at the very least to seek
leave to revive a claim or further to particularise one.  It is to obviate the
incurring unnecessarily of loss of court time and costs by such a procedure,
that I have made the orders that I outlined at the beginning
of these
reasons.
<P>

7   	It must be stressed that the defendant is entitled, within
the short time I have allowed the plaintiff, first to a clear articulation
of
the nature of the claim the plaintiff is making in the face of the abandonment
of her claim for special damages, and second how
so ever it is articulated
along the lines I suggested in the opening remarks, then the defendant is
entitled to particulars as I
have ordered and discovery as I have ordered.
<P>

8   	In the event that there has been non compliance by the
plaintiff by 5pm on 17 November, then it fairly can be anticipated that
on the
19th any application made again by the defendant for the relief of the kind
sought this morning will receive sympathetic consideration.
<P>

9   	The defendant has leave to administer an additional two
interrogatories in relation to the placement of advertisements for
the
plaintiff's business.  Those interrogatories are to be delivered by no later
than 4pm on 10 November 1999, and to be answered
by 4pm on 17 November 1999.
<P>

10   	I will note that the defendant has argued that an order
for costs should be made in respect of today, and in its favour, particularly
in the light of a letter of 2 November. I will reserve that question until 17
November.
