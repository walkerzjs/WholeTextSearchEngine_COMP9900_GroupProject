<P>

3   	Annexure A to the Further Amended Summons was in the
following terms:-
<P>

<center>"ANNEXURE A</center>
<P>


<P>

1.	By reason of no allocation having been made in any Accounting Period between
1 July 1992 and 30 June 1997 (or additionally between
1 January 1990 and 30
June 1992) to persons who in those periods were owners of copyright in sound
recordings incorporated into the
sound track of cinematograph films ("t<b>he
Compensable Persons"</b>), the plaintiff through its directors will calculate
the total amount of compensatory payments to be paid to the Compensable Persons

Persons would have received if the Scheme of Allocation,
then being applied,
allocated a proportion of the Distributable Amount to the Compensable Persons
("<b>the Compensatory Amount"</b>).
<P>

2.	In each of the Accounting Periods ending 30 June 1998, 30 June 1999 and 30
June 2000 the plaintiff through its directors will,

(b)	pay such of the Compensatory Amount so deducted to such of the Compensable
Persons as the plaintiff reasonably can identify
who:
<P>

(i)	in the relevant Accounting Period, would have had allocated to them a
Potential Share of the Distributable Amount for that Accounting
Period had the
Scheme of Allocation, then being applied, allocated a proportion of the
Distributable Amount to the Compensable Persons;
and
<P>

(ii)	are members of the plaintiff at the time of payment.
<P>

3.	The plaintiff may continue to make payments to Compensable Persons after 30
June 2000.
<P>

4.	If by 30 June 2001 the plaintiff:
<P>

(a)	has been unable to identify all the Compensable Persons, or
<P>

(b)	not all persons whom the plaintiff has identified as Compensable Persons
are members of the plaintiff or do not become members
of the plaintiff, with
the consequence that by 30 June 2001 the plaintiff will not have paid out all
the Compensable Amount, the
plaintiff shall within a reasonable time after 30
June 2001 apply to the Court for directions in relation to such of the
Compensable
Amount as the plaintiff has not paid out."
<P>

In this <u>further</u> Amended Summons and Annexure "A" to it:
<P>

<b>"Accounting Period"</b>, as defined in paragraph 1 above, has the same
meaning as in the Articles of Association of the plaintiff.
<P>

<u>The Facts</u>
<P>

4   	The plaintiff is a company limited by guarantee which was
duly incorporated under the laws of the State of New South Wales
on 8 January
1990.  The plaintiff adopted the trading name "Screenrights" in 1997.  On 13
June 1990 the then Attorney-General for
the Commonwealth of Australia, pursuant
to section 135P(1) of the Act, declared the plaintiff to be "the collecting
society for the
purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/index.html#p5a" class="autolink_findacts">Part VA</a> of the Act" which deals with the "Copying
of transmissions by educational and other institutions".
<P>

5   	Section 135E of the Act is in the following terms:-
<P>

"135E.  
<P>

(1)  The copyright in a transmission, or in any work, sound recording or
cinematograph film included in a transmission, is not infringed
by the making,
by or on behalf of an administering body, of a copy of the transmission if:
<P>

(a)	a remuneration notice, given by or on behalf of the administering body to
the collecting society, is in force;
<P>

(b)	where the copy is made by, or on behalf of, a body administering an
educational institution-the copy is made solely for the
educational purposes of
the institution or of another educational institution;
<P>

(c)	where the copy is made by, or on behalf of, a body administering an
institution assisting persons with an intellectual disability-the
copy is made
solely  for the purposes of use in the provision of assistance to persons with
an intellectual disability by the institution
or by another similar
institution; and 
<P>

(d)	the administering body complies with subsection 135K(1) or (3), as the case
requires, in relation to the copy.
<P>

(2)	Where a copy of a transmission referred to in subsection 
<P>

(a)	is used for a purpose other than a purpose referred to in paragraph (1)(b)
or (c);
<P>

(b)	is made, sold or otherwise supplied for a financial profit; or
<P>

(c)	is given to an administering body when there is not in force a remuneration
notice given by that body to the collecting society;
<P>

with the consent of the administering body by whom, or on whose behalf, it is
made, subsection (1) does not apply, and shall be
taken never to have applied,
to the making of the copy."
<P>

6   	Section 135A provides, inter alia, that "administering
body" means a body administering an institution, that "collecting society"
means the body that is, for the time being, declared to be the collecting
society under section 135P, and "institution" means either
(a) an educational
institution or (b) an institution assisting persons with an intellectual
disability.
<P>

7   	Section 135G of the Act is in the following terms:-
<P>

"135G.  
<P>

(1)  An administering body may, by notice in writing given to the collecting
society by it or on its behalf, undertake to pay equitable
remuneration to the
society for copies of transmissions made by it, or on its behalf, being copies
made while the notice is in force.
<P>

(2)	A remuneration notice shall specify whether the amount of equitable
remuneration is to be assessed on the basis of a records
system or a sampling
system.
<P>

(3)	A remuneration notice comes into force on the day on which it is given to
the collecting society, or on such later day as is
specified in the notice, and
remains in force until it is revoked."
<P>

8   	By <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 10(1)</a> of the Act "sound recording" is defined to
mean "the aggregate of the sounds embodied in a record."
<P>

9   	"Record" is defined in that subsection to mean a disc,
tape, paper or other device in which sounds are embodied, "sound-track"
is
defined in relation to visual images forming part of a cinematograph film to
mean (a) the part of any article or thing, being
an article or thing in which
those visual images are embodied, in which sounds are embodied;  or (b) a disc,
tape or other device
in which sounds are embodied and which is made available
by the maker of the film for use in conjunction with the article or thing
in
which those visual images are embodied", and "work" is defined to mean a
literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work.  A "cinematograph
film" is
defined to mean the aggregate of the visual images embodied in an article or
thing so as to be capable by the use of that
article or thing (a) of being
shown as a moving picture; or (b) of being embodied in another article or thing
by the use of which
it can be shown and includes the aggregate of the sounds
embodied in a sound-track associated with such visual images.
<P>

10   	Section 135H of the Act deals with the amount of equitable
remuneration payable to the collecting society by the administering
body where
that remuneration is to be assessed on the basis of a record system, and
section 135J of the Act deals with the amount
of equitable remuneration payable
to the collecting society by the administering body where the remuneration is
to be assessed on
the basis of a sampling system.  In each case the amount of
the equitable remuneration payable to the collecting society by the
administering
body is such an amount as is determined by agreement between the
administering body and the collecting society or, failing such agreement,
by
the Copyright Tribunal on application made by either of them.
<P>

11   	It was agreed between the parties that these proceedings
do not raise any issue in respect of which the Copyright Tribunal
has
jurisdiction.
<P>

12   	Section 135P of the Act also provides, inter alia, that
the Attorney-General shall not declare a body to be the collecting
society
unless, inter alia, all relevant copyright owners, or their agents, are
entitled to become its members and its rules contain
such other provisions as
are prescribed, being provisions necessary to ensure that the interests of the
collecting society's members
who are relevant copyright owners or their agents
are protected adequately.
<P>

13   	By section 135A of the Act a "relevant copyright owner" is
defined to mean the owner of the copyright in a work, a sound recording,
or a
cinematograph film.
<P>

<u>Submissions on behalf of the Plaintiff</u>
<P>

14   	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff, whose
submissions in this respect were adopted and supported on behalf of all
the
defendants, that the equitable remuneration collected by the plaintiff pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/index.html#p5a" class="autolink_findacts">Part VA</a> of the Act in each of the relevant accounting periods was held on
trust for the purposes and persons described in Articles 16.2,
16.3 and 16.6,
and in conformity with the obligations described in Article 17 of the
plaintiff's Articles of Association and not
otherwise.
<P>

15   	The provisions of the plaintiff's Articles of Association
which are principally relevant to this issue include the following:-
<P>

Article 15.4 which provides:-
<P>

"The Society must establish and operate:
<P>

(a)  A Statutory Trust Fund;
<P>

(b)  A Voluntary Trust Fund;  and
<P>

(c)  A Society Reserve Fund."
<P>

Article 15.5 provides:-
<P>

"The administrative costs and other outgoings of the Society that are paid out
of the Statutory Trust Fund and Voluntary Trust Fund
must be reasonable."
<P>

Article 1.1 defines "Statutory Trust Fund" as meaning:-
<P>

"The fund operated by the Society for the purposes of holding the Statutory
Collection on Trust for Qualified Persons."
<P>

Article 1.1 defines "Statutory Collection" as meaning:-
<P>

"In relation to each Accounting Period the amount of equitable remuneration
received by the Society in accordance with the Statutory
Scheme (and any
interest earned from investment of the equitable remuneration) that is
attributable to an Accounting Period."
<P>

Article 1.1 defines "Statutory Scheme" as meaning:-
<P>

"The Scheme in Australia under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/index.html#p5a" class="autolink_findacts">Part VA</a> ... under which the Society has been
authorised to collect equitable remuneration on behalf of Copyright Owners, and
to hold on trust
and distribute the amounts collected to the relevant Copyright
Owners, and any other scheme under the Act in respect of which the
Society is
declared to be the relevant collecting society."
<P>

Article 1.1 defines "Qualified Persons" as "a Copyright Owner" or "a Registered
Title Owner" and "Copyright Owner" is defined to
mean "a person who is the
legal or beneficial owner of copyright in a Copyright Work."
<P>

Article 16.2 provides:-
<P>

"In each Accounting Period, the Statutory Collection must be dealt with in the
following order:-
<P>

(a)    for the payment of all reasonable expenses that are incidental to the
conduct, management and operation of the Society as
the Directors consider
appropriate;
<P>

(b)    for such special purposes (including cultural and charitable purposes)
that the Directors consider are in the interest of
the Society, provided that
the funds expended for special purposes do not exceed 1% of the Statutory
Collection;
<P>

(c)   to the Society's Reserve Fund to meet any anticipated future obligations
of the Society as the Directors consider appropriate;
and
<P>

(d)     the remainder, for payment to each Qualified Person who is a Member, in
accordance with their Potential Share, as soon as
reasonably possible after
determination of their entitlement under Article 17."
<P>

Article 16.3 provides:-
<P>

"If the Society is unable, at the time of allocation, to distribute a Potential
Share (accruing under Article 16.2(d)) because the
Qualified Person is not a
Member or for any other reason, the Society must hold that Potential Share on
trust in the Statutory Trust
Fund and pay it to the Qualified Person (or their
Agent), as soon as reasonably possible, or otherwise in accordance with Article
16.6."
<P>

Article 16.6 provides:-
<P>

"If any Potential Share has remained in the Statutory Trust Fund or the
Voluntary Trust Fund under Articles 16.3 and 16.5 for a
period of four years
from the end of the accounting period in which the Directors determined the
relevant total Distributable Amount,
the monies may be distributed in
accordance with Articles 16.2 and 16.4 , unless the Directors are satisfied
that special circumstance
require the monies to be held on trust for a further
period of not more than two years."
<P>

16   	In my opinion, it is plain from the terms of the
plaintiff's Articles of Association, which relevantly constitute a contract
between the plaintiff on the one hand and its members on the other hand, and
from their context in the statutory scheme provided
for in the Act (as to which
see later), that both the plaintiff, through its board of directors, and its
members, intended that the
plaintiff should hold the whole of the amounts of
equitable remuneration collected by it (the "Statutory Collection") upon trust
for the purposes and persons described in Article 16.2, 16.3 and 16.6, and in
conformity with the obligations described in Article
17 of the plaintiff's
Articles of Association, and not otherwise, as the plaintiff submitted with the
support of the other defendants.
<P>

17   	This intention, is, in my opinion, manifested, inter alia,
by the frequent use of the word "trust" in the relevant Articles
(as well as in
the relevant provisions of the Act, as to which see later).  Thus for example
Article 15.4 provides for the Society
to establish, inter alia, a Statutory
<u>Trust</u> Fund and a Voluntary <u>Trust </u>Fund.  Article 1.1 then defines
"Statutory <u>Trust</u> Fund" to mean:  "The fund operated by the Society for
purposes of holding the Statutory Collection <u>on trust</u> for Qualified
Persons."  This definition in particular makes it plain, in my opinion, that
the intention of the parties to the Articles
of Association of the plaintiff
was that the equitable remuneration collected by the Society would be held "on
trust" for  the relevant
Copyright Owners ("Qualified Persons").
<P>

18   	Further, in the definition of "Statutory Scheme" there is
reference to the equitable remuneration collected by the Society
as having been
collected "on behalf of Copyright Owners" and to the fact that the Society has
been authorised "to hold <u>on trust </u>and distribute" the amounts collected
to the relevant Copyright Owners.
<P>

19   	There is further reference to the Society holding the
equitable remuneration collected on trust in Article 16.3, which provides
that
if the Society is unable at the time of allocation to distribute a Potential
Share because the Qualified Person is not a Member
or for any other reason, the
Society must hold that Potential Share "<u>on trust</u> in the Statutory Trust
Fund" and pay it to the Qualified Person (or their Agent) as soon as reasonably
possible, or otherwise in
accordance with Article 16.6."
<P>

20   	So far as concerns the terms of the plainly intended
trust, I note that Article 16.3 expressly provides the terms of the trust
so
far as the subject matter of that Article is concerned.  In the same way, in my
opinion, and although the word "trust" is not
used in Article 16.2, Article
16.2 relevantly defines the terms of the trust upon which the Society holds the
Statutory Collection,
that Article providing that "the Statutory Collection
must be dealt with" in the order specified in paragraphs (a) to (d) as set
out
above.
<P>

21   	I note in particular in this connection that Article
16.2(d) incorporates reference to the determination of the entitlement
of each
Qualified Person under Article 17, so that the terms of the trust, in my
opinion, also include the provisions of Article
17 as the plaintiff has
submitted.
<P>

22   	Article 17 is in the following terms:-
<P>

"17.1		The Directors must determine the total Distributable Amount at least
once in each Accounting Period."
<P>

(The "Distributable Amount" is the proportion of the Statutory Collection that
is available for distribution, that is, the amount
left after the Article
16.2(a)-(c) monies have been disbursed from the Statutory Collection).
<P>

"17.2		The Directors must exercise reasonable endeavours to ensure that each
Potential Share is allocated equitably and accurately.
<P>

17.3		The Directors must, in determining the scheme of allocation of the
Distributable Amount, have regard to all relevant matters
including without
limitation the following:
<P>

(a)	records;
<P>

(b)	information provided under a sampling procedure; and
<P>

(c)	any information obtained by the Directors that assists in ascertaining the
nature and extent of use of the Copyright Works or
the Registered Titles. 
<P>

	...
<P>

17.5		Except as provided in Articles 17.7 and 17.8 the allocation of Potential
Shares by the Directors is final and binding.
<P>

17.6		If a person claims to be entitled to a share in the Statutory Collection
or the Voluntary Collection and has not been allocated
a Potential Share, the
Directors may if satisfied that the person is entitled to a payment, make any
payment to the person that 
they consider fit, from the Society's Reserve
Fund.
<P>

17.7		If the Directors determine that a Potential Share allocated and paid to a
Qualified Person constitutes an over-allocation,
the excess may be deducted
from any subsequent allocation by the Directors to that person.
<P>

17.8		Where there is a dispute as to the amount of the Potential Share to which
a Qualified Person is entitled, the Directors must
retain the amount of the
Potential Share in the Statutory Trust Fund or the Voluntary Trust Fund as
applicable."
<P>

23   	The statutory context also makes it plain, in my opinion,
that it was equally the intention of the legislature in enacting
the relevant
provisions of the Act that the equitable remuneration collected by the
collecting society should be held upon trust
for the relevant Copyright Owners,
in accordance with the relevant provisions in the Articles of Association of
the collecting society
(the plaintiff) and the Act.
<P>

24   	Thus section 135D of the Act provides as follows:
<P>

"This Part applies to the collecting society despite anything in the rules of
the society but nothing in the Part affects those
rules so far as they can
operate together with this Part."
<P>

25   	In section 135A the term "Rules" is defined to mean "in
relation to the collecting society ... the provisions  of the memorandum
and
articles of association of the society."
<P>

26   	In relation to the collecting society the broad structure
and intent and purpose of the Act is that the collecting society
should collect
the relevant equitable remuneration from the relevant administering body for
the purpose of distributing the same
to the relevant Copyright Owners, after
deducting the appropriate administrative costs of so doing.  This, in my
opinion, is quite
inconsistent with any possibility that the collecting society
(plaintiff) should hold any part of the amounts of equitable remuneration
collected beneficially, in the sense that the collecting society (plaintiff)
would only have a contractual obligation to distribute
the equitable
remuneration to the relevant Copyright Owners, pending which the collecting
society (plaintiff) was free to do as it
wished with the relevant funds.  On
the contrary, in my opinion, it is plain that this was not the intention of the
legislature,
but rather that it was the legislature's intention that those
funds should be held by the collecting society (plaintiff) upon trust
for the
relevant Copyright Owners, the terms of the trust being those embodied in the
rules (Articles of Association) of the collecting
society (plaintiff) and/or
the Act as appropriate and, in particular, where the rules of the collecting
society (plaintiff) cannot
"operate together" with the Act.
<P>

27   	This underlying legislative structure, policy and purpose
is most clearly manifested, in my opinion, by the provisions of
section 135P
which has been referred to earlier and which provides, inter alia, that all
relevant Copyright Owners or their Agents
are entitled to become members of the
collecting society;  that the rules of the Society should prohibit payment of
dividends to
its members;  and that its rules should contain such other
provisions as are prescribed, being provisions necessary to ensure that
the
interests of the collecting society's members who are relevant Copyright Owners
or their agents are protected adequately, including
in particular, provisions
about:-
<P>

"(i)	the collection of amounts of equitable remuneration payable by
administering bodies ...
<P>

(ii)	the payment of the administrative costs of the Society out of amounts
collected by it;
<P>

(iii)	the distribution of amounts collected by it;
<P>

(iv)	the holding <u>on trust </u>by the Society of amounts for relevant
Copyright Owners who are not its members; and
<P>

(v)	access to records of the Society by its members."
<P>

[Underlining supplied]
<P>

28   	Particularly relevant is provision (iii) above, namely
"the distribution of amounts collected by it".  This indicates, in
my opinion,
that it is the very amounts which have been collected by the collecting society
(plaintiff) that are to be distributed,
and not merely some equivalent amount
by way of contractual obligation.  This provision clearly requires the amounts
collected and
to be distributed to be held separately and apart from any other
funds of the collecting society (plaintiff) (if any), and the statutory
obligation to keep the amounts collected separate is in my opinion a most
powerful indication of an intention that the relevant funds
should be held by
the collecting society (plaintiff) upon trust and, indeed, in my opinion, is
plainly inconsistent with any view
to the effect that the funds are to be held
by the collecting society (plaintiff) only subject to a contractual obligation
to distribute
the funds to relevant Copyright Owners.
<P>

29   	So also in my opinion is the provision contained in
paragraphs 4(iv) above indicative of an intention on the part of the
legislature
that the whole of the equitable remuneration collected is to be
held upon trust.  It is inconceivable, in my opinion, that that provision
requiring as matter of statute, the collecting society (plaintiff) to hold
<u>on trust </u>"amounts for relevant Copyright Owners who are not its
members", could have been intended to impose such a trust obligation upon the
collecting society (plaintiff), while at the same time imposing no such
obligation in relation to funds distributed to Copyright
Owners before that
distribution.
<P>

30   	Also consistent with the legislative intention to create a
trust of the relevant monies is, in my opinion, the very use of
the term
"remuneration", being remuneration to the relevant Copyright Owners.  The use
of this term, in my opinion, reinforces the
view that the collecting society
(plaintiff) is, in substance, collecting, as agent for the relevant Copyright
Owners, the remuneration
which is, in substance, payable by the administering
body directly to the relevant Copyright Owners, so that in a very real sense
the monies collected by the collecting society (plaintiff) are, from the moment
of collection, the funds of the relevant Copyright
Owners, rather than the
funds of the collecting society (plaintiff) subject only to a contractual
obligation to pay the equivalent
amounts to the relevant Copyright Owners.  It
is plain, in my opinion that when an agent (the plaintiff collecting society)
receives
on behalf of a principal (the relevant Copyright Owners), funds, not
merely payable to the principal, but funds to which the principal
is entitled
at all relevant times, those funds must be kept separately by the agent from
his own funds, and the agent plainly holds
those separate funds upon trust for
the principal.
<P>

31   	I also note that in the Articles of Association of the
plaintiff the term "Statutory Scheme" is defined in Article 1.1 to
mean: "The
Scheme in Australia under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/index.html#p5a" class="autolink_findacts">Part VA</a> ... under which the Society has been
authorised to collect equitable remuneration <u>on behalf of</u> Copyright
Owners and to hold <u>on trust</u> and distribute the amounts collected to the
relevant Copyright Owners".  
<P>

32   	In my opinion, this provision in that definition, that the
plaintiff has been authorised to collect equitable remuneration
"on behalf" of
the Copyright Owners, and to hold on trust and distribute the amounts collected
to the relevant Copyright Owners,
is a further indication that the equitable
remuneration collected consists of amounts which are paid for and to which the
Copyright
Owners are entitled, and which are collected by the Society as agent
for the Copyright Owners, which by reason of the fact that those
monies are the
monies of the Copyright Owners, and are held on trust, should be kept separate,
this obligation being, as stated earlier,
one of the important indicia of the
creation of a trust.
<P>

33   	I also note in Copyright regulation 23J, being the
provisions prescribed by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, pursuant
to
section 135P(3)(d), as provisions which must be contained in the rules of the
collecting society (plaintiff), that reference is
made in sub-paragraph
(1)(g)(ii)(C  to "the trust fund", in sub-paragraph (1)(h) to a "trust fund"
and to "the holding on trust"
of Potential Shares, and in sub-paragraph (1)( )
to any part of the distributable amount being "held on trust in the trust fund
referred
to in paragraph (h)".
<P>

34   	I also note the reference in Regulation 23J(1)(g)(ii)(A)
to "a trust fund".
<P>

35   	Accordingly, for all these reasons, I am clearly of the
opinion that the amounts of equitable remuneration collected by the
plaintiff
on behalf of the relevant Copyright Owners are held by the plaintiff upon trust
for the purposes and persons described
in Articles 16.2, 16.3 and 16.6, and in
conformity with the obligations described in Article 17 of the plaintiff's
Articles of Association,
and not otherwise, as the plaintiff submitted with the
support of all the defendants to the present proceedings.  Accordingly, I
propose to make a declaration to this effect by consent, although I indicate
that it is also the Court's clear view that the plaintiff
is entitled to a
declaration in the terms sought.
<P>

36   	The plaintiff also sought consequential declarations to
the effect that the plaintiff was either in breach or not in breach
of the
trust which I propose to declare, by reason of the plaintiff having failed for
a number of years to distribute any part of
the equitable remuneration
collected by it to the owners of copyright in sound recordings incorporated
into the sound-track of cinematograph
films.  The omission of the plaintiff to
make those distributions to the relevant owners of copyright in sound
recordings incorporated
into the sound-track of cinematograph films resulted
from the belief of the directors of the plaintiff, which was shared by a
majority
of the persons concerned in the relevant industry, that no separate
right existed in such a sound recording by reason of the provisions
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
23(1)</a> of the Act which provides as follows:
<P>

"23	(1)	For the purpose of this Act, sounds embodied in a sound-track
associated with visual images forming part of cinematograph
film shall be
deemed not to be a sound recording."
<P>

37   	This commonly held view as to the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 23(1)</a>
of the Act was, in due course, found to be erroneous by the High Court of
Australia by a majority of three to two in the case of
<b><i>Phonographic
Performance Company of Australia Ltd and Ors. v Federation of Australian
Commercial Television</i> <i>Stations </i></b>(1998) 154 ALR 211.  In that case
the Court held that although <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 23(1)</a> operated to deny any separate
protection of the sound recording for the sounds embodied in a sound-track
which form part of a cinematograph
film, the provision did not operate to deny
to the broadcasting of a film the character of a broadcast of the sound
recording.  The
majority of the Court held at 216 as follows:-
<P>

"The respondent's contention was that because <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23(1)</a> deems the sounds embodied
in a sound-track not to be a sound recording, broadcasting the film does not
broadcast the sound recording
embodied in the sound-track.  But the fact that
the sound-track is not a sound recording (or as the Act has it `sounds embodied
in
a sound-track ... shall be deemed not to be a sound recording') does not
mean that the broadcast of a film embodying a sound recording
does not
broadcast that sound recording as well as the film.  The broadcast of a sound
recording may occur in many contexts.  The
simplest, and most obvious, is the
radio or television station that plays the recording in the course of its
transmission to the
public.  But if, in the course of a live production of a
dramatic work which is broadcast by radio or television, a sound recording
is
broadcast, there is a broadcast of that sound recording for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
85.</a>  No less is there a broadcast of a sound recording when a cinematograph
film, the sound-track of which embodies that sound recording,
is broadcast to
the public.  The fact that the sound-track is deemed by the Act not to be a
sound recording is not to the point.
 The question is whether the aggregate of
sounds embodied in the sound recording has been broadcast.  What the Act deems
not to be
a sound recording is the aggregate of sounds that is recorded in a
particular form:  a sound-track.  Usually, the aggregate of sounds
recorded in
the sound-track will be larger than, or, in some other way, different from the
aggregate of sounds that constitutes the
sound recording.  Broadcasting the
film broadcasts the sound-track (which is not a sound recording) but it also
broadcasts the aggregate
of sounds which constitutes the sound recording."
<P>

38   	This decision was handed down by the Court on 20 May 1998
and on 26 June 1998 the first defendant, an organisation which collects
copyright royalties on behalf of record companies, demanded payment of "the
proportionate share of the distributable receipts of
Screenrights attributable
to the reproduction of sound recordings".
<P>

39   	Reference was made on behalf of the plaintiff to a
possible view that, in failing to make distributions to persons who were
the
owners of copyright in sound recordings incorporated into the sound-track of
cinematograph films, the plaintiff was not in breach
of the relevant trust the
subject of the declaration referred to above, because the plaintiff was subject
only to a duty of good
faith, skill, care, prudence and diligence in ensuring
that each Potential Share was allocated equitably and accurately, by reason
of
the provisions of Article 17.2 which provide that:
<P>

"The Directors must exercise reasonable endeavours to ensure that each
Potential Share is allocated equitably and accurately".
<P>

40   	However, the principal submission made on behalf of the
plaintiff, with the support of all the defendants, was to the effect
that in
adopting a Scheme of Allocation under which no allocation was made to persons
who were the owners of copyright in sound recordings
incorporated into the
sound-track of cinematograph films the plaintiff was in breach of the trust
referred to in the declaration
referred to above. 
<P>

41   	In my opinion, it is plain that the plaintiff was in
breach of trust in so acting, albeit unwittingly, since, the terms of
the trust
upon which it held the equitable remuneration collected by it required it,
inter alia, to deal with "the Statutory Collection",
after payment of certain
amounts as specified in the Articles, "for payment to each Qualified Person who
is a Member, in accordance
with their Potential Share as soon as reasonably
possible after determination of their entitlement under Article 17."
<P>

42   	Although at the relevant times the persons who were owners
of copyright in sound recordings incorporated into the sound-track
of
cinematograph films were not members of the plaintiff (collecting society), a
further relevant term of the trust was that contained
in Article 16.3 which
provides as follows:-
<P>

"If the Society is unable, at the time of allocation, to distribute a Potential
Share (accruing under Article 16.2(d)) because the
Qualified Person is not a
Member or for any other reason, the Society must hold that Potential Share on
trust in the Statutory Trust
Fund and pay it to the Qualified Person (or their
Agent), as soon as reasonably possible, or otherwise in accordance with Article
16.6."
<P>

43   	Owing to its mistaken view of the law at the relevant
times, the plaintiff did none of these things in certain Accounting
Periods in
respect of relevant Copyright Owners, being the owners of copyright in sound
recordings incorporated into the sound-track
of cinematograph films broadcast
by educational and certain other institutions, with the result that the
plaintiff was plainly, in
my opinion, in breach of the trust upon which it held
the equitable remuneration collected.  Accordingly, I propose to make a
declaration
to this effect in accordance with the principal submission in this
connection made on behalf of the plaintiff.  I note that all defendants
consented to the making of a declaration in the terms sought on behalf of the
plaintiff, but I record that, although the declaration
will be made by consent
of all the defendants, the declaration also embodies the Court's own view of
the matter.
<P>

44   	The plaintiff next submitted that, in all the
circumstances, the plaintiff should be relieved from any personal liability
for
the breaches of trust committed by it, pursuant to the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 85</a>
of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act 1925</a> (NSW) </i></b>by reason of the fact that it had
at all times acted honestly and reasonably and ought fairly to be excused for
the breaches of trust,
and for omitting to obtain the direction of the Court in
respect of the subject matter of those breaches.
<P>

45   	The precise circumstances in which those breaches of trust
were committed were as follows: the plaintiff's original Scheme
of Distribution
was formally implemented by the plaintiff at a meeting of the Board of the
plaintiff on 4 September 1990.  The Scheme
of Distribution was incorporated
into the plaintiff's Distribution Policy under the heading of "Scheme of
Allocation".  A copy of
the minutes of the meeting of 4 September 1990 was
tendered to the Court.  
<P>

46   	This Scheme of Distribution was in the same form as a
Scheme of Distribution which had been agreed at a meeting of the Copyright
Interests Committee on 25 July 1989, which was an informal committee of
interest groups which was instrumental in establishing the
plaintiff.  Those
interest groups included the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the
Australian Record Industry Association, the
Australian Mechanical Copyright
Owners Society, the Screen Producers Association of Australia and the
Australian Writer's Guild amongst
others.  The minutes of the meeting of the
Copyright Interests Committee of 25 July 1989 were also tendered in
evidence.
<P>

47   	At that meeting it was resolved that the total
distributable fund would be allocated as follows:-
<P>

(a)	as to the copyrights in cinematograph films 70%;
<P>

(b)	as to the copyrights in literary and dramatic works 22.5%;
<P>

(c)	as to the copyrights in musical works 7.5%.
<P>

48   	In the course of the meeting of the Board of Directors of
the plaintiff on 4 September 1990, it was noted that the directors
believed
that the Scheme of Distribution took into account all potential categories of
claims, with the exception of owners of copyright
in artistic works, in respect
of which it was resolved that any claims from owners of copyright in artistic
works would normally
be met by producers out of their share, with recourse to
the contingency fund if necessary.
<P>

49   	It was the recollection of Ms Rowe, presently a director
of the plaintiff, and formerly its chairperson for a number of years,
and who
attended the meetings on 25 July 1989 and 4 September 1990, that no discussion
took place in relation to the position of
the owners of the copyright in the
sound recordings of musical works because she understood at that time that the
Act did not recognise
any separate copyright interest in a sound recording
after it had been incorporated into the sound-track of a film.  When the
allocation
of 7.5% to "musical works"  was resolved, it was her understanding
that the allocation was intended to cover the whole musical component
of a
film.  Further evidence as to what was discussed at the meetings of 25 July
1989 and 4 September 1990, as well as what was discussed
at an earlier meeting
of the Copyright Interests Committee on 18 July 1989, is contained in the
affidavit of Ms Rowe of 14 December
1998.
<P>

50   	There has not, to Ms Rowe's knowledge, been any challenge
to the percentage allocations set out above which were resolved
at the meeting
of the Copyright Interests Committee on 25 July 1989 and subsequently adopted
by the Board of Directors of the plaintiff
on 4 September 1990, apart from
ongoing discussions in relation to the position of artistic works (see
later).
<P>

51   	At the meeting of the Copyright Interests Committee on 25
July 1989, a representative of the first defendant was present,
whilst at the
meeting of the Board of Directors of the plaintiff of 4 September 1990, the
present Executive Director of the first
defendant was present as a director of
the plaintiff.  No objections were raised by either of these representatives of
the first
defendant at either of those meetings as to the percentage
allocations agreed upon in the Scheme of Distribution.  The minutes of
those
two meetings do not record, and Ms Rowe does not recall, any suggestion from
either of these representatives that a separate
allocation to the rights
holders of sound recordings of musical works should be included in the Scheme
of Distribution which was
resolved by the Copyright Interests Committee and
adopted by Screenrights in those two meetings.  Ms Rowe was not aware of any
claim
being made by the first defendant or any other person in relation to the
payment by the plaintiff of a separate allocation of royalties
by the rights
holders of sound recordings of musical works in relation to cinematograph film
prior to the letter from the first defendant
dated 26 June 1998.
<P>

52   	Ms Rowe gave evidence that no allowance was made in the
Distribution Policy for royalties to be allocated to the owners of
copyright in
sound recordings which had been incorporated into the sound-track of
cinematograph films, because it was the view of
the members of the Board of
Directors of the plaintiff and to her knowledge of the copyright industry
generally, as well as being
her own view, that no separate right existed, as a
matter of law, in such a sound recording, by reason of the provisions of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 23(1)</a> of the Act set out above.
<P>

53   	In all the circumstances, I am clearly of the view that
the plaintiff, at all relevant times, acted honestly and reasonably
and ought
fairly to be excused for the breaches of trust referred to earlier, and should
accordingly be relieved from any personal
liability in respect thereof.
Accordingly, I propose to make a declaration or order to this effect in
accordance with the submissions
made on behalf of the plaintiff in this
connection.  I note that this proposed order also is made with the consent of
all defendants,
although I record that the Court would have made such an order
even if there had been opposition to that course.
<P>

54   	The plaintiff also sought a declaration that
implementation by the plaintiff of the course of action described in Annexure
"A" to the summons was within the powers conferred on it pursuant to the
Articles, particularly Article 17.7, and/or the general
law.
<P>

55   	Annexure "A" has been quoted above.
<P>

56   	The substance of the course of conduct described in
Annexure "A" is that the plaintiff, through its directors, will calculate,
in
respect of various earlier Accounting Periods, the total or aggregate amount
("the Compensatory Amount") which the plaintiff should
have paid, but did not
pay, to the owners of copyright in sound recordings incorporated into the
sound-track of cinematograph films
("the Compensable Persons") (being the total
or aggregate amount of the compensatory payments to be paid to the Compensable
Persons
calculated by reference to the aggregate amount of Potential Shares
that the Compensable Persons would have received if the Scheme
of Allocation,
then being applied, had allocated a proportion of the Distributable Amount to
the Compensable Persons).  In each of
the Accounting Periods ending 30 June
1998, 30 June 1999 and 30 June 2000, there will then be deducted one-third of
the Compensatory
Amount from the total or aggregate of the Distributable Amount
payable in respect of each of those three years, and so much of the
Compensatory Amount, as so deducted, will be paid to such of the Compensable
Persons as the plaintiff can reasonably identify who,
in the relevant period,
would have had allocated to them a Potential Share of the Distributable Amount
for that Accounting Period,
had the Scheme of Allocation then being applied
allocated a proportion of the Distributable Amount to the Compensable Persons,
and
who are members of the plaintiff at the time of payment.
<P>

57   	In this connection the first question for determination is
whether the plaintiff has power to deduct any part of the Compensatory
Amount
payable in respect of previous Accounting Periods, from the Distributable
Amounts referable to later Accounting Periods.
<P>

58   	In this connection counsel for the plaintiff submitted
that one source of power for the implementation of such a scheme was
to be
found in Article 17.7 which provides:-
<P>

"If the Directors determine that a Potential Share allocated and paid to a
Qualified Person constitutes an over-allocation, the
excess may be deducted
from any subsequent allocation by the Directors to that person."
<P>

59   	In my opinion, however, the proposed course of conduct
would not be authorised by the Articles of Association of the plaintiff
and, in
particular, would not be authorised by Article 17.7 of those Articles, or by
the general law, by reason that what is proposed
in Annexure "A" is not in
accordance with those Articles or the general law because, inter alia, the
strict application of Article
17.7 and of the general law requires exact
precision as to the identity of the recipient and amount of any over-allocation
which,
on the evidence, is, practically speaking, not possible.
<P>

60   	It was also submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that an
alternative basis for the course of conduct proposed in Annexure
"A" to the
further amended summons was Article 16.2(a) of the Articles of Association of
the plaintiff which provides, in effect,
that the Statutory Collection must be
first applied "for the payment of all reasonable expenses that are incidental
to the conduct,
management and operation of the Society as the Directors
consider appropriate."  In my opinion, however, the payment of the Compensatory
Amount to the Compensable Persons as envisaged in Annexure "A" would not
constitute the payment of "reasonable expenses that are
incidental to the
conduct, management and operation of the Society", more particularly, because,
in my opinion, the non-payment to
the relevant Copyright Owners, which was the
result of a mistake as to law, cannot be regarded as simply incidental to the
conduct
management and operation of the Society within the meaning of Article
16.2(a).  That Article is, in my opinion, directed to the payment
of reasonable
expenses that are incidental to the proper and correct and lawful conduct
management and operation of the Society and
is not, for example, intended to
comprehend the payment of all reasonable expenses that are incidental to the
committing by the plaintiff
of breaches of trust.
<P>

61   	In this connection I also note that, in my opinion, and
contrary to the supplementary submission on behalf of the plaintiff,
Article
16.2(c  , on its true construction does not authorise the plaintiff to pay the
Compensatory Amount to the Compensable Persons,
principally, inter alia,
because that Article is limited to payment of "any<u> anticipated future</u>
obligations, and the Compensatory Amount does not fall within the description
as an "<u>anticipated future</u> obligation".
<P>

62   	It remains to consider whether, notwithstanding that it
would involve a breach of trust, the plaintiff would be justified
within the
meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 63</a> of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act 1925</a> (NSW) </i></b>in adopting
the course of conduct described in Annexure "A" to the Further Amended
Summons.
<P>

63   	Whilst it is plain that, in respect of the earlier
Accounting Periods some Qualified Persons will have been allocated a Potential
Share which did constitute an over-allocation, the individual members of that
class may have varied from Accounting Period to Accounting
Period, both as to
their identity and as to their allocated share of equitable remuneration making
it extremely difficult, as a practical
matter, to identify those members and to
calculate the precise amount of over-allocations in each Accounting Period.
There would
also be the difficulty of identifying in respect of each previous
Accounting Period which relevant individual Copyright Owners of
copyright in
sound recordings incorporated into the sound-track of cinematograph films
should have received a share, and if so, what
share, of the equitable
remuneration collected by the plaintiff.  This is a task which will also have
to be performed in respect
of individual future accounting periods, no doubt,
with the help, inter alia, of the first defendant.  Nevertheless, the task of
doing this in respect of the previous Accounting Periods would, as the
plaintiff submitted, be, at the very least, extremely burdensome
at best, and,
at worst, practically speaking, impossible.  The evidence in this connection is
contained in paragraphs 91 to 96 of
the affidavit of Ms Rowe of 14 December
which are in the following terms:-
<P>

"91.	If Screenrights is required to make compensatory payments to owners of
sound recordings of musical works, this will involve
a significant
administrative burden.
<P>

92.	Each program copied under the Scheme for which Screenrights has previously
allocated a Potential Share, is likely to contain
a number of sound recordings
of musical works.  If Screenrights were required to make payments to each of
the individual rights holders
for these sound recordings this would involve
performing calculations and making separate payments for each sound recording.
Such
a course of action would involve considerable time and expense on
Screenrights' part.
<P>

93.	For example, there were approximately 13,000 individual identified works in
programs copied under the Scheme in the 1997 Distribution
Period (the period
from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997).  Using the 1997 Distribution Period figure
as a guide, Screenrights will need
to rely upon the assistance of other
organisations to identify approximately 90,000 sound recordings of musical
works (being approximately
13,000 for seven individual distribution
periods).
<P>

94.	In the event that Screenrights was required to make payments to the rights
holders in sound recordings of musical works, detailed
identification and
ownership information about each sound recording would be required to be
undertaken.  Screenrights does not currently
have any such information in its
possession.  Screenrights has not previously paid royalties to the rights
holders in sound recordings
and consequently has not collected any data that
would assist it in making payments to individual rights holders to sound
recordings.
<P>

95.	Identification assistance could be sought from Screenrights from a number
of sources.  The initial task of identifying each
individual musical work, is
likely to be conducted by APRA.  It is my understanding that the APRA database
may contain some data
as to the owners of the sound recordings of some of these
musical works.
<P>

96.	Although a comprehensive identification process will need to be implemented
to make payments to rights holders in sound recordings
of musical works from
the 1998 Distribution Period and onwards, the volume of sound recordings of
musical works from earlier distribution
periods makes the task of identifying
who is entitled to compensatory payments burdensome to Screenrights."
<P>

64   	In these circumstances, the Board of Directors of the
plaintiff has formed the view that it is fair and equitable that the
consequences of the innocent mistake made in previous years by the company
should be shared among all classes of rights holders.
<P>

65   	In relation to Annexure "A" to the further amended
summons, this approach would mean, as stated above, that in each of the
three
Accounting Periods ending 30 June 1998, 30 June 1999 and 30 June 2000 all
classes of rights holders, and the individual members
of all such classes,
would have the amounts to which they would have otherwise been entitled reduced
by one-third, even if it were
the case that, in respect of some or all of the
previous Accounting Periods, some of those individual members may not have been
over-allocated
and/or overpaid, or not have been over-allocated and/or overpaid
to the extent that would justify reduction of their entitlements
in respect of
future Accounting Periods by one-third.  It would appear that the only way to
overcome such a result would be to undertake
the course of identifying in
respect of each of the earlier Accounting Periods the individual relevant
Copyright Owners who may have
received an over-allocation and if so to what
extent.  It is plain that this would be as stated above an extremely burdensome
task
to the extent of being, practically speaking, impossible.
<P>

66   	As I understand it, it is not suggested that it is
impossible for the directors of the plaintiff to calculate the total amount
of
Compensatory Payments to be paid to the Compensable Persons by reference to the
aggregate amount of Potential Shares that the
Compensable Persons would have
received if the Scheme of Allocation then being applied had allocated a
proportion of the distributable
amount to the Compensable Persons.  Rather, as
I understand it, the difficulty arises from the practical impossibility of
identifying
the individual persons who were overpaid or over allocated
royalties and determining the amount of any such overpayment or over allocation
in each of the relevant prior Accounting Periods, and it is to overcome that
difficulty that the plaintiff proposes that the Compensatory
Payments will be
paid in respect of each of the three relevant periods by all those Copyright
Owners who are entitled to distributions
in each of those periods, to a greater
or lesser extent, even though they may not have been, but others were, overpaid
or over allocated
royalties in respect of one or more of the prior Accounting
Periods.
<P>

67   	I am of the prima facie opinion that within the meaning of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 63</a> of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act 1925</a> (NSW)</i></b> the plaintiff would be
justified in adopting the course of conduct described in Annexure "A" to the
further amended summons, with
the qualification and upon the basis referred to
below.  I say "prima facie" because having regard, inter alia, to the
substantial
sums of money involved I require further argument, and, if
necessary further evidence, before I would be prepared to express a final
view
on this matter.
<P>

68   	In all the circumstances, I am also prima facie of the
view that not only would the plaintiff be justified in following the
course of
conduct described in Annexure "A" to the further amended summons with the
qualification and on the basis referred to below,
but that, to the extent that
in doing so the plaintiff would commit a breach of trust, the plaintiff would
have acted honestly, reasonably
and ought fairly be excused within the meaning
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 85</a> of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act 1925</a> (NSW).</i></b>  
<P>

69   	The qualification referred to above arises from the
submission by counsel on behalf of the first defendant, and others, to
the
effect that in each of the three years in which Compensatory Payments are to be
made, the full amount payable to owners of copyright
in sound recordings
incorporated into the sound-track of cinematograph films should first be
notionally paid, after which the Compensatory
Payments should be paid from the
balance of the Distributable Amounts since otherwise, so it was submitted, that
class of copyright
owners would end up subsidising itself.
<P>

70   	It was also submitted on behalf of the first defendant,
and others, that the relevant Copyright Owners had been kept out of
their money
for many years by reason of the failure to compensate them for uses of their
copyright material whilst, in the meantime,
other classes of Copyright Owners
had been overpaid.  In those circumstances it was submitted that it was
inappropriate that affected
sound recording Copyright Owners should share in
the burden of compensating themselves.
<P>

71   	In my prima facie opinion, the submissions made on behalf
of the first defendant are well founded.  Whilst it is true that
it is not
possible to state that the members of the class of Copyright Owners represented
by the first defendant in future Accounting
Periods will be the same as the
members of that class in respect of the previous Accounting Periods, in respect
of which they were
not paid, and upon the assumption that, practically
speaking, it will be impossible to identify the relevant members of that class
on a year by year basis in respect of previous Accounting Periods, in my prima
facie opinion more substantial justice would nevertheless
be achieved if the
first defendant's submissions were to be accepted, upon the basis that there is
at least, perhaps, some likelihood
that there will be some overlap between the
members of the same class in previous and future Accounting Periods.
<P>

72   	In all the circumstances, however, I decline at the
present time to express any final opinion as to whether the plaintiff
would be
justified in acting in accordance with the proposed course of conduct described
in Annexure "A" subject to, or not subject
to, the qualification referred to
above, and although I have expressed a prima facie view for the assistance of
the parties, that
should not be taken as placing any onus on any party to
displace my prima facie view since I propose to consider the whole matter
de
novo in the light of the further submissions and, if appropriate, further
evidence.
<P>

73   	The next question which arises for consideration is as to
whether the plaintiff is entitled to distribute royalties relating
to Prior
Accounting Periods, which are currently undistributed, on the basis of the old
Scheme of Allocation which was in operation
during those previous periods
(being the 1993-1997 Accounting Periods).
<P>

74   	As a result of the delay in the identification and
authentication of Copyright Owners entitled to payments from the plaintiff,
an
amount of $7,044,059.80 of the Distributable Amounts relating to those
distribution periods is currently undistributed.  The plaintiff
proposes to
distribute this amount in accordance with  the old Scheme of Allocation, which,
as stated earlier, did not recognise
the rights of Copyright Owners of sound
recordings in musical works incorporated into film sound-tracks, on the basis
that those
Copyright Owners will be compensated under the Scheme of
Compensation proposed in Annexure "A".  The reasons for this approach on
the
part of the plaintiff are contained in paragraph 14 of the affidavit of Ms Rowe
of 23 December 1998 which was as follows:-
<P>

"14.	The reasons why the Undistributed Amount should be distributed in
accordance with the old Scheme of Allocation are as follows:
<P>

(a)	to distribute the Undistributed Amount on the basis of the new Scheme of
Allocation would be inequitable.  This is because the
total Distributable
Amount for each of the 1991-1997 distribution periods has been allocated in
accordance with the old Scheme of
Allocation.  On the basis of this allocation,
some rights holders in a particular copied program in a particular distribution
period
have already been paid, while other rights holders in relation to that
same copied program remain unpaid (these unpaid amounts are
included in the
Undistributed Amount).  If the Undistributed Amount was distributed on the
basis of the new Scheme of Allocation,
the situation could arise where rights
holders of musical works in a program which have already been paid will have
received a Potential
Share of 7.5%, whereas, rights holders of musical works in
that same program who have not been paid, would receive 6.6%.  This would
mean
that rights holders whose works or subject matter are incorporated in the same
program would be treated differently in relation
to use of that work or subject
matter in the same distribution period.
<P>

(b)	a more equitable approach is to treat the payment of all royalties relating
to the 1991-1997 distribution periods equally on
the basis of the old Scheme of
Allocation.  Under this approach, owners of copyright in sound recordings in
musical works would all
be compensated on the same basis.  That is, the
Compensatory Amount (as described in the proposed Amended Summons) will be
funded
by making deductions against the Distributable Amount for the next three
distribution periods.  By funding the Compensatory Amount
in this way, it means
that the burden of funding the Compensatory Amount will fall proportionately on
all rights holders in relation
to the entire period in which Screenrights was
operating under a mistake of law.
<P>

(c)	If the Undistributed Amount was distributed on the basis of the new Scheme
of Allocation (and therefore the 0.9% amount to be
paid to owners of copyright
of sound recordings in musical works would be taken from the 7.5% allocation to
musical works), owners
of copyright of musical works would bear the full burden
of compensating owners of copyright of sound recordings in musical works.
 This
burden would be inconsistent with the scheme in Annexure A to the proposed
Amended Summons which provides that the burden of
compensating owners of
copyright in sound recordings in musical works in relation to amounts which
have been distributed will fall
proportionately on all rights holders.
<P>

(d)	Screenrights' database does not contain sufficient information which would
allow Screenrights to identify the Potential Shares
which are owing to
individual musical works within a program.  This means that, if Screenrights
was required to distribute the Undistributed
Amount on the basis of the new
Scheme of Allocation, it would have to rely on APRA to carry out the
calculations of royalties owing
to individual musical works within a program.
This calculation must be carried out by APRA before the amount which is payable
to
owners of copyright of sound recordings in musical works can be identified
by Screenrights.  The administrative burden of identifying
each of these
musical works is considerable and the extent of this task is unknown at this
stage.
<P>

(e)	Screenrights' database, which contains information to identify Potential
Shares which are allocated to individual cinematograph
films and
literary/dramatic works, was developed in such a way that the old Scheme of
Allocation is hard-coded with the application
rather than relying on a variable
which can be re-defined.  Because of this design limitation, it would require
significant redevelopment
work to allow the application to generate payments of
the Undistributed Amount on the basis of the new Scheme of Allocation."
<P>

75   	As the question here being considered is so intimately
bound up with the issues relating to the course of conduct proposed
in Annexure
"A", it is equally appropriate that further consideration of this question
should also be postponed pending the further
argument, and as appropriate,
further evidence on those issues.
<P>

76   	I note, however, in this connection, that, it is my
opinion, contrary to the supplementary submission on behalf of the plaintiff,
that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 81</a> of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act 1925</a> (NSW)</i></b> does not authorise
the Court to empower the plaintiff to distribute royalties relating to Prior
Accounting Periods, which are currently
undistributed, on the basis of the old
Scheme of Allocation, because to do so would, in my opinion, have the effect of
altering the
beneficial interests of the relevant beneficiaries, and it is
common ground that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s81.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 81</a> cannot be validly used to confer a power which
produces such a result.
<P>

77   	There remains for consideration certain issues relating to
the sixth defendant,  a body representing owners of copyright in
artistic works
included in cinematograph films.  
<P>

78   	The first question relating to the sixth defendant is as
to whether the plaintiff was entitled to pay to the sixth defendant
the sum of
$12,300 from the plaintiff's IBNR Fund ("Incurred But Not Reported"), or
whether, in so doing, the plaintiff was in breach
of the trust the subject of
the first declaration referred to above.  This issue arises in relation to
cinematograph films where
artistic works are the principal matter of the film,
for example, a documentary film about an artist.  The plaintiff has always
recognised
owners of copyright in artistic works as relevant Copyright Owners
but has not previously included such owners within its Scheme
of Allocation
because it is difficult to identify programmes where artistic works are the
principal matter of the film, and because
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 67</a> of the Act which
provides that:-  
<P>

"The copyright in an artistic work is not infringed by the inclusion of the
work in a cinematograph film or in a television broadcast
if its inclusion in
the film or broadcast is only incidental to the principal matters represented
in the film or broadcast."
<P>

79   	In May 1997 the Board of Directors of the plaintiff
resolved that, where a film qualifies as having artistic works as the
principal
matter of a cinematograph film or television broadcast, it would make
allocations of an amount equivalent to 22.5% of the
royalties accruing to that
film, to owners of artistic works.  The Board of Directors of the plaintiff
resolved that this allocation
would be made from the IBNR Fund and, not from
the Distributable Amount, because of the difficulty in identifying
cinematograph films
and television broadcasts in which the artistic works were
the principal matters represented in the  film or broadcast.
<P>

80   	Because allocations are made to owners of copyright in
artistic works from the IBNR Fund, in fact, a distribution of 122.5%
of that
films proper entitlement is made.  This is because 70% is paid to the rights
holder in the film, 22.5% to the rights holder
in the script and 7.5% to the
musical rights holders (each of these three payments comes from the
Distribution Amount) and in addition
22.5% is paid to the owners of the
copyright in artistic works where applicable (which is drawn from the IBNR
Fund).
<P>

81   	The only payment made to date to copyright owners of
artistic works pursuant to this policy was $12,300 paid to the sixth
defendant
in June 1998 for the 1992 Distribution Period (equivalent to 0.4% of the
Distributable Amount for the 1992 year).
<P>

82   	The allocations from the IBNR Fund have been possible
because the IBNR Fund is 1% of the total Distributable Amount for each
year.

<P>

83   	As previously stated, the plaintiff did not include owners
of copyright in artistic works in its Distribution Policy (instead
making
allocations to such owners from the IBNR Fund), because of the difficulty in
identifying the use of artistic works in programmes
which did not fall within
the exception in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 67</a> of the Act.  Those difficulties are set out in the
affidavit of Ms Rowe of 14 December 1998 and in particular in paragraph 105
thereof
which is in the following terms:-
<P>

"105.	The difficulties faced by Screenrights in identifying programs
incorporating artistic works as the principal subject matter
are considerable.
Screenrights is only provided with title information (title, broadcast
date/time, and channel) in relation to a
particular program.  This information
does not reveal whether a program has artistic works contained within it and,
if so, the identity
of those artistic works (including the number thereof)
included in the program.  It is unlikely that this information could ever
be
obtained from the surveys currently conducted on behalf of Screenrights to
monitor the level of copying by end users.  For example,
the staff of
Institutions cannot be required to specify artistic works contained in every
copied program, and whether the use of
the artistic work was incidental or
central to the program, because copying of programs is almost always done prior
to the time when
the program is actually watched."
<P>

84   	The plaintiff is currently considering the issue of how to
deal with payments to owners of copyright in artistic works which
have not yet
been made in relation to the 1993-1998 years.  The plaintiff wishes to make
such payments from the IBNR Fund in the
same manner as the payment was made to
the sixth defendant in June 1998 for the 1992 Distribution Period.
<P>

85   	The sixth defendant has provided extensive written
submissions to the plaintiff setting out the reasons why it considers it
should
be specifically included within the plaintiff's Scheme of Allocation.  On 25
November 1998 the Board of Directors of the plaintiff
resolved to commence the
same type of research and consultation in respect of the rights of owners of
copyright in artistic works
as it has undertaken in respect of the rights of
owners of copyright in sound recordings of musical works.  If after due
consideration
the Board of Directors of the plaintiff were to decide to amend
the Scheme of Allocation to take into account the rights owners of
copyright in
artistic works, this would take effect from the 1999 Distribution Period.
<P>

86   	The Articles of Association of the plaintiff do not
expressly refer to the constituting of an IBNR Fund but, as submitted
on behalf
of the plaintiff, that Fund appears to be the same in purpose and operation as
the "Society Reserve Fund" referred to in
Articles 15.4(c), 16.2(c), 16.4(c)
and 17.6.
<P>

87   	Thus, as stated earlier, Article 15.4 provides, inter
alia, that the Society must establish, inter alia, "a Society Reserve
Fund".

<P>

88   	"Society Reserve Fund" is defined in Article 1.1 of the
plaintiff's Articles of Association to mean "a fund established and
operated by
the Society for the purposes of Articles 16.2(c  and 16.4(c ."
<P>

89   	Article 16.2 provides, inter alia, that in each Accounting
Period the Statutory Collection must be dealt with in a certain
order, in
respect of which the third item of the order is "to the Society's Reserve Fund
to meet any anticipated future obligations
of the Society as the Directors
consider appropriate."  "Statutory Collection" is defined in Article 1.1 of the
Articles of Association
of the plaintiff to mean "in relation to each
Accounting Period, the amount of equitable remuneration received by the Society
in
accordance with the Statutory Scheme (and any interest earned from
investment of the equitable remuneration) that is attributable
to an Accounting
Period";  and Article 17.6 in the following terms:-
<P>

"17.6		If a person claims to be entitled to a share in the Statutory Collection
or the Voluntary Collection and has not been allocated
a Potential Share, the
Directors may, if satisfied that the person is entitled to a payment, make any
payment to the person that
they consider fit, from the Society's Reserve
Fund".
<P>

90   	Article 16.4 of the plaintiff's Articles of Association
provides that in each Accounting Period the Voluntary Collection must
be dealt
with in a certain order, the third item of that order being "to Society's
Reserve Fund to meet anticipated future obligations
of the Society under the
Voluntary Scheme as the Directors consider appropriate";  "Voluntary
Collection" is defined in Article 1.1
to mean "in relation to each Accounting
Period, the royalties received by the Society under the Voluntary Scheme (and
any interest
earned from investment of royalties received) that is attributable
to an Accounting Period";  "Voluntary Scheme" is defined in Article
1.1 of the
plaintiff's Articles of Association to mean "any scheme other than the
Statutory Scheme, pursuant to which the Society
holds on trust royalties
collected for Registered Title Owners who have authorised the Society to act as
their agent in administering
their Registered Title Rights".
<P>

91   	I also note that paragraph 6.1 of the plaintiff's current
Distribution Policy provides, inter alia, in relation to the IBNR
Fund, as
follows:-
<P>

"An allocation of 1% of the total Distributable Amount may be made to the IBNR
Fund (amended 27 July 1994) and by analogy with insurance
practice, `claims
incurred but not reported' may be met from the IBNR Fund, which is an
allocation to a class of relevant Copyright
Owners of their Potential Share of
the Distributable Amount which the Society will not further automatically
allocate to a particular
programme title ... Allocation to a particular title
will be made when a relevant copyright owner makes a claim that is accepted
by
the Society in accordance with the Scheme of Distribution or when information
becomes available to identify the Potential Share.
<P>

Distributions anticipated from this Fund include ...
<P>

(b)	payment to a relevant Copyright Owner not otherwise specifically provided
for, such as an owner of copyright in ... artistic
works included in a
broadcast or footage and stills included in a broadcast (other than a news
broadcast) ...".
<P>

92   	It will be observed that Article 16.2 of the plaintiff's
Articles of Association provides in effect that, there shall be a
"Society
Reserve Fund" for the purpose of meeting "any anticipated future obligations of
the Society as the Directors consider appropriate".
 It will further be
observed that the IBNR Fund as described in the plaintiff's Distribution Policy
was established for the purpose
of constituting "an allocation to a class of
relevant Copyright Owners of their Potential Share of the Distributable Amount"
in respect
of which "Allocation to a particular title will be made when a
relevant Copyright Owner makes a claim that is accepted by the Society".
 Such
allocation to a particular title would, in my opinion, plainly be properly
described as being a payment "to meet anticipated
future obligation of the
Society as the Directors consider appropriate" within the meaning of Article
16.2 of the plaintiff's Articles
of Association which, as stated above,
provides, in effect, for the establishment of a "Society Reserve Fund".  
<P>

93   	In those circumstances it is, in my opinion, appropriate,
for present purposes, to treat the IBNR Fund as being in substance
"the Society
Reserve Fund" within the meaning of 16.2(c) and other Articles of Association
of the plaintiff, including Article 17.6.
 In those circumstances, in my
opinion, the payment to the sixth defendant of the sum of $12,300 out of the
IBNR Fund in July 1998,
in respect of the 1992 Accounting Period, did not
involve the plaintiff in any breach of trust because it was in substance, as
was
submitted on behalf of the plaintiff, a valid payment made pursuant to
Article 17.6 of the plaintiff's Articles of Association. 
I note that all
defendants supported the making of a declaration to this effect but I record
that it is the view of the Court, quite
apart from any question of consent,
that the plaintiff was entitled to the declaration sought.
<P>

94   	Having regard to this finding no occasion arises for
considering the applicability of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 85</a> of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act
1925</a></i></b> in relation to this payment.  However I indicate that, in my
opinion, if contrary to my view, the plaintiff was in breach of trust
in making
the said payment of $12,300 to the sixth defendant, I would have been of the
opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to
be relieved from any personal
liability in respect thereof upon the basis that, in the relevant
circumstances, it had acted honestly
and reasonably and ought fairly to be
excused for the breach of trust and for omitting to obtain the direction of the
Court in respect
of the subject matter of the breach.
<P>

95   	In this connection I accept, in particular, the evidence
to the effect that the plaintiff acted honestly and reasonably in
not including
owners of the copyright in artistic works in its Distribution Policy, but
instead making allocations to such owners
from the IBNR Fund, because of the
difficulty facing the plaintiff in identifying the use of artistic works in
programmes which did
not fall within the exception in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 67</a> of the Act and
because that Fund had been especially set aside for such purposes.
<P>

96   	The substance of what the plaintiff did in this respect
was to take the view that, because of the difficulties involved in
identifying
relevant owners of the copyright in relevant artistic works, it would not make
any direct provision for distributions
on that account in its Distribution
Policy, but because it recognised that there might be some relevant owners of
copyright in artistic
works who were thereby excluded, it should set up a fund,
being the IBNR Fund, for the purpose of satisfying such claims as might
later
be made on an individual basis, pending further investigations and discussions
as to the practicalities of making an allocation
to such copyright owner as
part of the Distribution Policy.
<P>

97   	For broadly the same reasons as expressed above in
relation to the payment by the plaintiff to the sixth defendant of the
sum of
$12,300 from the plaintiff's IBNR Fund, I am also of the opinion that, upon the
basis that the plaintiff has still not resolved
the difficulties involved in
identifying the owners of the copyright in relevant artistic works, but is
continuing to use its best
endeavours to do so, the plaintiff is entitled to
make payments out of the IBNR Fund to the sixth defendant or other owners of
copyright
in artistic works in respect of the 1993-1998 Accounting Periods.
<P>

98   	Because the plaintiff is still considering its position in
relation to owners of copyright in artistic works represented by
the sixth
defendant, I am of the opinion that it would be premature to consider making
any other declarations sought on behalf of
the sixth defendant, inter alia,
because the plaintiff may decide for itself to act accordingly.  In the event
that after the plaintiff
has made its decision, there remain differences of
opinion, or doubts, between the plaintiff and the sixth defendant and/or other
defendants, the matter may be listed for further hearing pursuant to the
liberty to apply which I propose to reserve to all parties.
 
<P>

99   	I record, however, for completeness that the following
submissions, inter alia, were made on behalf of the sixth defendant:-
<P>

"(1)	That the plaintiff has adopted a test for identifying when the
reproduction of an artistic work in a film entitles the copyright
owner in that
artistic work to remuneration which differs from the exception provided in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 67</a> of the Act.
<P>

(2)	That the Distribution Policy of the plaintiff in relation to artistic works
applies the fair dealing provisions of the Act in
a way which it is not
apparent that they are applied to other copyright works and other subject
matter. 
<P>

 (3)	That the sixth defendant should be specifically included in any Scheme of
Allocation and that the plaintiff should amend the
Scheme of Allocation to take
into account the rights of owners of copyright in artistic works with effect
from the 1999 distribution.
<P>

(4)	That, taking the same approach as the first defendant, there should first
be deducted from the total Distributable Amount the
required payment to be made
for the current year to affected owners of copyright in artistic works before
paying one-third of the
remaining balance of the Compensatory Amount in each of
the next three years to the relevant Copyright Owners or their
representatives.
<P>

(5)	That there may be other owners of copyright in artistic works whose works
have been included in a cinematograph film as the
principal matter who have not
been compensated for uses of their copyright material in the 1992 Distribution
Period.
<P>

(6)	That, thus, amounts held in trust by the plaintiff in the IBNR Fund and in
the Article 16 trust fund may include amounts due
to persons the sixth
defendant represents."
<P>

<u>Other Rights of the Parties</u>
<P>

100   	All parties agreed that any declarations and orders made
in the present proceedings should not prejudice any rights which
any of the
defendants or, any of those whom they represent, may have in relation to the
determination by the plaintiff, whether by
its Directors or otherwise, of the
Compensatory Amount as defined in Annexure "A" to the further amended summons.
As this correctly
reflects the basis upon which the present proceedings were
conducted I propose to make this position clear in the declarations which
I
will make.
<P>

<u>Representative Orders</u>
<P>

101   	I am satisfied that it is appropriate to make appropriate
representative orders in respect of all representative parties
to these
proceedings and I propose to do so, noting that no party has any objection to
the making of any of those orders.
<P>

<u>Costs</u>
<P>

102   	As these proceedings were in the nature of an important
test case in relation to the powers rights, and duties of the plaintiff
and of
the various defendants, I am of the opinion that the costs of the plaintiff of
these proceedings on an indemnity basis should
be paid out of the Statutory
Collection Fund held upon trust by the plaintiff, and that the costs of the
proceedings of each of the
defendants be paid out of the said Statutory
Collection Fund on the party and party basis.
<P>

<u>Direction</u>
<P>

103   	I direct the plaintiff to bring in short minutes of order
giving effect to these reasons for judgment and providing that
all parties
should have liberty to apply on two days notice.
<P>
