<b>JUDGMENT -- </b>ex tempore
<P>

<b>2 September 1999</b>
<P>

1   	What follows are brief observations in the context of
undertakings proffered by the NRMA without admissions and noted in the
transcript.  The matter came before me on an urgent basis by Notice of Motion
filed by Mr Yates as Plaintiff against the NRMA as
Defendant.  In the events
that happened, the Defendant was able to deal with the Notice of Motion this
evening though received at
short notice, after the Plaintiff made clear that he
did not move on paragraphs 4 and 5 and corrected the dates in paragraph 3 to
substitute Monday and Tuesday dates next week for the incorrect reference to
October 1999.
<P>

2   	The undertakings the subject of to-day's Notice of Motion
were proffered by the Defendant without admissions on Friday last
27 August
1999 following another urgent and late afternoon sitting.  No time limit was
expressly stated in the undertaking and in
particular that part of it dealing
with corrective advertising.  But it was clear from my statement in Court --
that I would not
having regard to the seriousness of the matter, defer matters
to the following Monday -- that proper expedition was required to deal
with the
corrective advertising within the parameters of what was reasonable.
<P>

3   	On Friday 27 August 1999 Mr Yates issued a press release
which continued a campaign of criticism of the NRMA Board.  However,
while the
statements were amplified so as to make clear that a capital decline was
complained of, no attempt was made to repeat the
reasons given in evidence by
the NRMA for why it took fifteen months to dispose of the relevant parcels of
shares, more particularly
elaborated in my judgment of 20 August 1999.  That
omission may or may not have been misleading and I deliberately reach no
conclusion
on that matter, as there is no Motion before me about it. 
<P>

4   	I similarly note that in a television advertisement on
Wednesday 1 September 1999 Mr Yates refers to a "$71m capital decline
in two
shareholdings in just two months".
<P>

5   	As I stated in my judgment, a director who makes statements
of that kind has a fiduciary duty to ensure that they are not misleading
either
by reason of commission or omission.  Again I make no finding on whether the
quoted statement was unduly economic, though
I pause to note that the complaint
about the NRMA's advertisement which led to last Friday's proceedings was that
it omitted reference
to anything other than the profit that would be derived by
comparing the historical cost of the shares to the sale price received.
 It was
that statement that I likewise described at the time as economic, insofar as no
reference was made to the accounting loss
of $37 million;  this led to the NRMA
proffering without admissions the undertakings to which I have earlier
referred.
<P>

6   	I wish to state with proper emphasis that in a contested
application for the election of a board, it is incumbent on directors,
whether
speaking as individuals or collectively, to ensure that any campaigning they
choose to carry out is not misleading or deceptive
or otherwise contrary to the
fiduciary duties applicable to directors.  There is no reason why, consistent
with a director's duty,
campaigning could not be carried out with the
appropriate care to ensure that those who are members of the NRMA have the
benefit
of opposing views, but without misleading or deceptive material in
breach of fiduciary duty, including statements misleading by omission.
Accordingly, I should warn that further applications of the present sort, which
have taken a great deal of Court time and no doubt
expense to the parties will
be met with a serious emphasis on making orders, including cost orders and, if
warranted, contempt orders,
which are directed to ensuring that shareholders
are not misled.  In other words, it may not be appropriate on the next occasion
simply to deal with the matter by way of undertakings.
<P>

<b>Costs</b>
<P>

7   	Ordinarily the Plaintiff would receive its costs.  In the
present case, the circumstances in which the matter has come before
me make it
more difficult simply to attribute fault to one party rather than both.  Had Mr
Yates not issued the media release to
which I have earlier made reference, it
would be quite clear that the Plaintiff was entitled to its costs.  However,
the Defendant
states that it sought legal advice as to whether it should apply
for a discharge of its undertaking or presumably some variation
of it.  The
Defendant then contends that because no time period was explicitly laid down,
the test is what is reasonable and it was
reasonable in the context of Mr
Yates' media release of 27 August 1999 to seek such advice and to take the
necessary time to do so.
 Hence this in the circumstances led to the corrective
advertising being only published over the next two days, some seven days after
the undertaking, though now to be augmented by the further advertising the
subject of to-day's undertakings.  
<P>

8   	The Plaintiff responds that undertakings given to the court
are serious matters and departure from them is not justified simply
by a desire
to obtain legal advice.
<P>

9   	On balance, I consider that the Plaintiff has the better of
the argument, but I do not consider that indemnity costs are appropriate.
 It
was always open to the Defendant to have approached the Court and sought
additional time and explained the circumstances.  That
was not done.
<P>

<b>ORDERS</b>
<P>

10   	I order that the Defendant pay the Plaintiff's cost of
this application.
<P>
