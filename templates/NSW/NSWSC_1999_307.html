SZPILCZAC</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  In these proceedings commenced by Summons on 22 September
1998, the plaintiffs seek a declaration that they are not in breach of
s 48 of
the <b><i>Motor Accidents Act 1987</i></b> for failing to submit to an
interrogation by an investigator nominated by the defendant.
<P>

2	The matter was previously heard by Adams J on 26 October 1998 in the absence
of the defendant and his legal representatives, but
on 3 December 1998 Hulme J,
by consent, ordered that the orders made by Adams J be set aside and the matter
be re-heard.
<P>

3	The present plaintiffs are also the plaintiffs in District Court action
1745/98 in which they seek damages for personal injuries
suffered by the
first-named plaintiff in a motor vehicle accident and the proceedings are
accordingly governed by the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Accidents Act 1988</a></i></b> (the
Act).
<P>

4	For present purposes it is only necessary to recite that the plaintiff in his
Personal Injury Claim Form, pursuant to s 43 of
the Act asserted that police
from Newtown came to the scene of the accident, but later enquiries of the New
South Wales Police Service
indicated that the police had no record of any
report of the accident.  Consequently, by letter dated 23 February 1998, the
defendant's
insurer wrote to the plaintiffs' solicitors making a formal
request, said to be pursuant to s 48(1)(a) and (b) of the Act, for permission
to interview the first plaintiff to obtain a statement in relation to the
circumstances of the accident.  In the letter they made
reference to the fact
that Newtown police confirmed they knew nothing about the plaintiffs' accident.
By letter dated 9 March, the
first plaintiff through his solicitors refused the
interview but agreed to answer specified questions submitted in writing.
<P>

5	Shortly afterwards the first plaintiff commenced the relevant proceedings in
the District Court at Sydney.  By Notice of Motion
filed in that Court on 23
April 1998 the defendant sought orders that the Statement of Claim be dismissed
or alternatively struck
out on the grounds that the plaintiff had failed to
comply with s 42 of the Act and also failed to comply with s 48(1)(a) and (b)
of the Act, in that he had failed to furnish information sufficient to allow
the defendant to investigate the validity of the claim
for breach of duty of
care prior to commencement of the proceedings.
<P>

6	The motion came on for hearing before McLachlan ADCJ and in his judgment on
14 July 1998 his Honour dismissed the claim so far
as it related to s 42, but
in relation to s 48 said:
<P>

	"I believe that there was a s 48 breach by the plaintiff in that if the
plaintiff did not wish to be interviewed, the two statements
by Eysmont should
have been provided ...
<P>

	In the circumstances as they were at the time of the filing of the Statement
of Claim, the action should not have been commenced.
 However, in view of the s
54(4) problem, I suggest for consideration that the plaintiff's solicitor serve
an affidavit by the plaintiff
containing the plaintiff's in-chief evidence as
to both liability and quantum and I would then intend to case manage the
case.
<P>

	If the plaintiff's solicitor does not wish to take up this proposal, then I
will strike the action out, but before I make any order
I should of course give
the parties opportunity to consider what I have said and address me if they
think appropriate".
<P>

7	The matter was adjourned.  Subsequently on 10 August 1998 his Honour ordered
that the plaintiff submit to an interview with an
investigator (that is,
nominated by the defendant's insurer) within forty-eight days, leave to apply,
and the matter was adjourned.
 It appears that the plaintiff sought the period
of forty-eight days in order to enable this application to be made and, whilst
the
defendant consented to the period of time, he did not consent to anything
else.
<P>

8	Section 48 imposes various duties of co-operation on a plaintiff and subs (3)
of that section provides that if the claimant fails
without reasonable excuse
to comply with the section, court proceedings cannot be commenced in respect of
the claim while the failure
continues.
<P>

9	It was in reliance of s 48(3) that the application to dismiss or strike out
the Statement of Claim was made.
<P>

10	His Honour indicated in his judgment earlier referred to that at the
proposed interview the plaintiff's solicitor could be present
and the plaintiff
was not to be cross-examined by the investigator.
<P>

11	A preliminary question has arisen as to whether this Court has the power to
make a declaration in this case and if so, whether
it should make such a
declaration. 
<P>

12	On behalf of the defendant it has been submitted firstly, that the court has
no jurisdiction, secondly, that these proceedings
are an abuse of process, and
thirdly, that in the exercise of my discretion I should decline to exercise the
declaratory jurisdiction
conferred on the Court by s 75 of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme
Court Act 1970</a></i></b>.  
<P>

13	In relation to jurisdiction, my attention was directed to s 143 of the
<b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Act 1973</a></i></b> as amended by the <b><i>District Court
Amendment Act 1997 No 58</i></b> which should be read in conjunction with s
41(1)(d) inserted by the same Act, which conferred jurisdiction unlimited as to
amount
on the District Court in any motor accident claim, including all actions
under the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Accidents Act</a></i></b>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/s143.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 143</a> provides if this
Court is of the view that proceedings pending in the Court could properly have
been commenced in the District Court,
it may transfer the proceedings to that
court and subs (5) provides:
<P>

	"Without limiting any power of the Supreme Court under this section, the
Supreme Court may, at any time after the commencement
and before the hearing of
the action, consider any action for damages in respect of personal injury or
death, in order to determine
whether an order under this section transferring
the proceedings ought to be made.  Having considered the action, the Supreme
Court
is to make such an order unless:
<P>

	(a)	in the case of a motor accident claim, the Supreme Court is satisfied that
the amount to be awarded to the plaintiff in the
case, if successful, would be
likely to exceed $1 million and that the case involves complex legal issues or
issues of general public
importance . . . . . ."
<P>

14	That section clearly does not apply to these proceedings because they are a
claim for a declaration and are not an action for
damages in respect of
personal injury or death.  Accordingly, neither that section nor any other
provision of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/" class="autolink_findacts">District Court Act</a></i></b> deprives this Court of
jurisdiction, but on the other hand, s 143 evinces a clear intention that
except in a very limited class of
case (of which the current proceedings in the
District Court is not one), all actions under the Act are to be heard and
determined
in the District Court.
<P>

15	It was next submitted that these proceedings constitute an abuse of process
because they seek to litigate in this Court a matter
which is already the
subject of litigation in another court of competent jurisdiction within this
State: see generally <b><i>Williams v Hunt</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1905%5d%201%20KB%20512" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1905] 1 KB 512</a>;
<b><i>McHenry v Lewis</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281882%29%2022%20Ch%20D%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1882) 22 Ch D 397.</a>
<P>

16	I am satisfied that these proceedings do come within the principle and
constitute an abuse of process.  In this regard I refer
in particular to the
Notice of Motion filed in the District Court to which I have already referred.
That motion specifically sought
an order dismissing the Statement of Claim or
striking it out upon the grounds of a failure to comply with s 48(1)(a) and (b)
of
the Act.  That is exactly the same issue as is sought to be litigated in the
present Summons which, as I have said, seeks a declaration
that the plaintiffs
are not in breach of s 48 of the Act.  However, merely because the proceedings
constitute an abuse of process
does not, as far as I can tell in the limited
time available to me, render them incompetent, although there is a discretion
for the
Court to strike them out for that reason.
<P>

17	I therefore proceed to consider the question of the exercise of discretion
which the Court undoubtedly has in respect of declaratory
relief under s 75 of
the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></i></b>.
<P>

18	One consideration that is always relevant to the exercise of discretion is
the availability of alternative remedies in other
courts or tribunals.  In
<b><i>Forster v Jododex Pty Limited</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1972/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1972] HCA 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%20127%20CLR%20421" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) 127 CLR 421</a> the question
arose as to whether the court should make a declaration in relation to the
rights of a party which were the subject
of proceedings before Mining Warden.
Street J, as he then was, at first instance had made the declaration.  At 438
Gibbs J said:
<P>

	"The question whether the Court should make a declaration which would have the
effect of deciding a question in issue in pending
proceedings may often be of
some difficulty.  It is of course important that the proceedings in the present
case were not pending
in an ordinary court.  However, there were some obvious
reasons why a judge should hesitate before intervening when the matter was
about to come before a warden".
<P>

19	He then considered a number of reasons in favour of exercising the
discretion; it was a matter of statutory construction and
the matter had been
fully argued, both at first instance and before the High Court, and he
concluded that as a matter of convenience
it was appropriate to grant
declaratory relief.  I draw attention  in particular to the fact that one of
the matters considered relevant
by his Honour was that the other proceedings
were not in an "ordinary court."  The other Justices agreed with him on this
point,
although Walsh J expressed considerable reservations and said at 427:
<P>

	"In my opinion, when a special tribunal is appointed by a statute to deal with
matters arising under its provisions and to determine
disputes concerning the
granting of rights or privileges which are dependent entirely upon the statute,
then as a general rule and
in the absence of some special reason for
intervening, the special procedures laid down by the statute should be allowed
to take
their course and should not be displaced by the making of declaratory
orders concerning the respective rights of the parties under
the statute".
<P>

20	A number of cases on the exercise of the discretion where there are
alternative civil remedies are collected in <b><u>Young: Declaratory Orders</u>
(1975)</b> at paras [805]-[809].  I draw attention in particular to <b><i>Blank
v Beroya Pty Ltd</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%2092%20WN%28NSW%29%2024" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 92 WN(NSW) 24</a> where Street J, declined to
exercise the declaratory jurisdiction where all the questions raised were
properly to be investigated
by the magistrate in the Court of Petty Sessions in
tenancy proceedings and said (at 26) that as a general proposition the
jurisdiction
of this Court to grant declaratory relief will not be exercised
where another tribunal has full jurisdiction to investigate and determine
the
matters raised, and where that other tribunal can be seen to be the tribunal
either expressly indicated by Parliament or indicated
by considerations of
convenience to be the preferable tribunal to entertain the contest.  See also
<b><i>Land v Clyne</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281968%29%2092%20WN%28NSW%29%20134" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1968) 92 WN(NSW) 134.</a>  There is also a long string
of decisions to the effect that it is undesirable for this Court to intervene
by declaratory relief
in committal or criminal proceedings, see, for example,
<b><i>Sankey v Whitlam</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1978/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] HCA 43</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20142%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 142 CLR 1</a> at 25-26.
<P>

21	In this case, not only is there jurisdiction in the District Court to
determine the matter, and not only does s 143 of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/" class="autolink_findacts">District Court
Act</a></i></b> make it clear that that is the tribunal favoured by Parliament for
the determination of these issues, but the proceedings are already
on foot to
determine this very issue in the District Court and consequently I am satisfied
these proceedings are an abuse of process.
 It goes further than that, because
not only have the proceedings to determine this very issue commenced in the
District Court but
they have been determined by McLachlan ADCJ in that Court;
and although not in form, this is in effect an appeal by the plaintiffs
against
his Honour's decision.  Appeals from decisions of the District Court lie to the
Court of Appeal, in interlocutory cases by
leave of that Court, and in my view
it is not appropriate for a judge sitting in a Division to circumvent or permit
the parties to
circumvent or avoid that procedure by granting declaratory
relief.
<P>

22	Mr Goodridge on behalf of the plaintiffs has pointed to a number of factors
which he submits should persuade me in the exercise
of my discretion to
consider the matter on its merits.  He submits that as the order is conditional
the plaintiffs cannot apply to
the Court of Appeal.  I see no problem here.
The District Court has made an order that the first plaintiff submit to an
interview
with the investigator and has indicated that if he does not the
Statement of Claim will be dismissed or struck out.  If it is the
first
plaintiff's contention that that is an order that could not have been made, or
should not have been made, the remedy is to
apply to the Court of Appeal for
leave to appeal.
<P>

23	It was also submitted that the question of the right of defendants'
investigators to interview plaintiffs is a matter of general
concern in
proceedings under the Act and it would be desirable to have a ruling from a
judge of this Court which would be binding
on District Court judges.  The
obvious answer to this argument is it would be even better to have an
authoritative ruling from the
Court of Appeal if that was what was desired.
<P>

24	It would be undesirable, in my view, for interlocutory rulings in the
District Court to be the subject of applications to this
Court for declaratory
relief.  To give another example removed from this litigation: if proceedings
were pending in the District
Court for damages for breach of contract, it would
be undesirable to apply to this Court for a declaration as to the proper
construction
of the contract.
<P>

25	For these reasons I am satisfied this is a case where this Court should not
intervene by way of declaratory relief and the parties
should be left to their
remedies under the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Accidents Act</a></i></b>, the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dca1973187/" class="autolink_findacts">District Court
Act</a></i></b> and their rights of appeal to the Court of Appeal.  Accordingly,
the summons is dismissed.
<P>

26	(Mr Goodridge addressed on costs.)  Although the plaintiffs have failed on
the discretionary ground indicated in my judgment,
it is a ground that in my
view the plaintiffs' advisers should have foreseen and anticipated.
Accordingly, I order the plaintiffs
to pay the defendant's costs of the
proceedings.
