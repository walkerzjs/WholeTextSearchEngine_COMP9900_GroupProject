<b>			OF AUSTRALIA  v  IYAD RAFIDI</b>
<P>

<b>			  &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Set aside default judgment)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed 19 October 1998 the
defendants seek that default judgment entered on 29 January 1997 be set aside.
The
defendants relied on their affidavits sworn 9 October 1998, a further
affidavit of the first defendant of 25 November 1998, affidavits
of Tony Manna
sworn 9 October 1998, Peter Graham Heness sworn 3 June 1999 and Roslind Sue
Winter of 19 May 1999.  The plaintiff relied
on the affidavits of Nicholas
Charles Ireland sworn 18 February 1999, Stephen John Asciak sworn 18 February,
Stephen Terry Dubedat
sworn 2 March 1999 and Paul Denison Westwood sworn 31 May
1999.  Mr Dubedat, Ms Winter and Mr Westwood are handwriting experts. 
Both
defendants were cross examined.
<P>

2  	The defendants sought an adjournment on the basis that firstly,
Mr Manna was unavailable for cross examination and secondly,
they wished to
file a further affidavit, namely that of Mr Heness.  Mr Heness was also
unavailable for cross examination.  The defendants'
solicitors had been
notified in time that Mr Manna was required for cross examination.  In lieu of
granting an adjournment, the plaintiffs
wished to proceed with the application
even if I allowed the affidavit of Mr Manna and Mr Heness into evidence.  I
allowed these
affidavits to be read.
<P>

<b><u>The Law</u></b>
<P>

3  	The relevant part of s 40 r 9(2) of the <b>Supreme Court
Rules</b> (the Rules) provide:
<P>

<b>"(2)	The Court may set aside or vary a judgment -</b>
<P>

<b>	...</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	where the judgment has been entered after judgment has been given in the
absence of a party, whether or not the absent party had
notice of trial or of
any motion for the judgment."</b>
<P>

4  	In determining whether default judgment should be set aside
Priestley JA in <b><u>Cohen v McWilliam</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2039%20NSWLR%20476" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 39 NSWLR 476</a> at 481
stated:
<P>

<b>"It is, however, another question whether concern about the extent of
delays, either in a particular case or generally, should, in
the absence of
prejudice in the particular case, be taken into account in exercising a
discretion to set aside default judgment.
 The fundamental duty of the court is
to do justice between the parties.  It is, in turn, fundamental to that duty
that the parties
should each be allowed a proper opportunity to put their cases
upon the merits of the matter.  Any limitation upon that opportunity
will
generally be justified only on the necessity to avoid prejudice to the
interests of some other party, occasioned by misconduct."</b>
<P>

5  	For the defendants to succeed in their application to set aside
default judgment they must give an adequate explanation for
the delay in filing
their defence and show that they have a defence on its merits, or as often
expressed a bona fide defence.  However,
as Priestley JA said in
<b><u>Cohen</u></b> it is a fundamental duty of the court to do justice between
the parties.
<P>

6  	The defendants' counsel submitted that I should accept the
defendants' evidence as truthful and that they have an arguable defence.
 The
plaintiff's counsel submitted that, firstly, the defence is not bona fide and
has no apparent prospect of success;  secondly,
the defendants have
deliberately sought to avoid service and their actions have caused the
plaintiff to incur substantial costs in
the Federal Court in the bankruptcy
proceedings and thirdly, that the defendants were aware of the default judgment
in 1997 so have
not adequately explained the delay in the moving to set aside
default judgment.  The defendants' defence is that the signatures which
appear
on p 5 of the guarantee were not made by them.  A copy of the proposed defence
is before the court.
<P>

7  	I turn to give a history of events that led to the default
judgment being entered.  By statement of claim filed 25 September
1996 the
plaintiff alleged that on 17 January 1996 the first and second defendants
executed a guarantee in favour of the plaintiffs
(the guarantee).  The first
defendant is Iyad Rafidi and the second defendant is Tina Rafidi.  The first
and second defendant are
married and were directors J J Kidz Where Pty Limited
ACN 066 196076 (Kidz) at the relevant times.  The guarantee was executed to
secure the repayments to the plaintiff of all moneys advanced or to be advanced
to Kidz up to an amount of $241,000 plus interest
and costs.  As at 28 August
1996 the plaintiff alleged Kidz was indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of
$186,929.54.  The plaintiff
demanded from Kidz payment of the sum of
$186,929.54 together with interest.  Also by letter dated 28 August 1996 the
plaintiff demanded
in writing payment of the sum of $186,929.54 from each of
the first and second defendants.  The plaintiff alleged that Kidz and the
first
and second defendants have failed to pay the $186,929.54.  The plaintiff sought
judgment against the first and second defendants
for that sum.  
<P>

8  	The plaintiff encountered difficulties in serving the statement
of claim upon the defendants.  To support the application for
substituted
service, the plaintiff relied on an affidavit of Brett Donnelly.  Mr Donnelly
deposed that he had spoken to Peter Heness,
the landlord to which the
defendants paid rent for commercial premises on 8 October 1996 at 3.30 in the
afternoon.  However, Mr Heness
disputes that this conversation occurred.  Mr
Heness deposed that during October 1996 he did not receive any enquiry from any
person
as to the whereabouts of Iyad Rafidi.  Neither Mr Donnelly or Mr Heness
were available for cross examination.  The plaintiff's solicitor
was not
notified in time that Mr Donnelly was required for cross examination.
<P>

9  	On 8 October 1996 Brett Donnelly also deposed that at 8.00 pm he
attended 6 Matero Close Edensor Park (the property) to serve
the defendants
with a statement of liquidated claim.  A male person he encountered told him
that the defendants had moved back to
Lebanon.  However, Mr Donnelly recorded
that the occupant of 7 Matero Close said that the people who lived at No 6 were
named Rafidi
and had been there for five years.  On 15 October 1996 Mr Donnelly
had a conversation with Iyad Rafidi where Mr Rafidi advised Mr
Donnelly that he
would accept service at any time.  The first defendant denies that he had a
conversation with Mr Donnelly and denies
being present at the property on that
day.  On 15 October 1996 at 8.55 pm Mr Donnelly attended the property and spoke
to a male person
he had not encountered previously.  The male person said "He
does not want to speak to you, now piss off."  Mr Donnelly was then
physically
assaulted.
<P>

10  	In a letter by Lawler Davidson to the plaintiff dated 23 August
1996 (Ex 1) the writer Mark Franklin referred to a conversation
with Mr Heness.
Mr Heness provided a wealth of information concerning the whereabouts and
financial position of the first defendant
to Mr Franklin.  
<P>

11  	A letter by Acumen Financial Services to Lawler Davidson dated 9
October 1996 stated that when the commercial agent attended
the property, a
male fitting the description of Iyad Rafidi advised that the defendants had
moved back to Lebanon.  Once again despite
the alleged return to Lebanon the
neighbours at Nos 7 and 9 confirmed to the commercial agent that the occupants
had lived there
for a number of years.  I accept there is a dispute between Mr
Donnelly and Mr Heness as to whether or not they had a conversation
in October
1996.  There is a dispute also as to whether Mr Donnelly spoke to the first
defendant on 15 October 1996.
<P>

12  	On 19 November 1996 the court made an order for substituted
service.  The court ordered that a sealed copy of the statement
of claim and
affidavit of Tessa Bruno sworn 15 November 1996 be posted by ordinary post to
No 6 Mataro Close, Edensor Park together
with the sealed copy of the order.
Service of the statement of claim was deemed to have occurred at the expiry of
14 days after the
above order had been complied with.  
<P>

13  	On 29 January 1997 default judgment was entered.  Judgment was
entered against the first and second defendants in the sum of
$196,186 with
costs.
<P>

14  	The contents of the defendants' affidavit of 9 October 1998 are
identical.  They deposed that they have never received a statement
of claim.
They say that at the time that service was purported to be effected they did
not reside at 6 Mataro Close, Edensor Park.
 They say that they left that home
on or about 1 July 1996 and moved in with the first defendant's brother-in-law
Tony Manna at 2/11
Chiswick Road, Granville.  They say they continued to reside
there until about 17 December 1996 when they moved to rented premises
in
Franklin Street, Bossley Park.  Tony Manna has also filed an affidavit
confirming the defendants' version of events but was unavailable
for cross
examination.  A real property search shows that on 18 August 1997 the
defendants transferred the property to Giuliano Carrozzi
and Melina
Cavasinni.
<P>

15  	In August 1997 a creditors petition was issued against the
defendants by Martin and Savage Pty Limited.  On 18 August 1997
the plaintiff
in these proceedings, the Commonwealth Development Bank, had its notice of
motion seeking to be substituted as petitioning
creditor heard.  The bank's
motion was unsuccessful on the basis that it had not made a demand for the sum
outstanding by the defendants
by July 1996, being the time the act of
bankruptcy relied upon the original creditor's petition.  The bank's demand was
not made
until August 1996 so the motion was dismissed.
<P>

16  	Since 18 August 1996 the plaintiff in these proceedings
attempted to serve bankruptcy notices upon the defendants. In August,
1998 the
defendants were forwarded the bankruptcy notices via the first defendant's
father's home at Cabramatta.  These notices referred
to the default judgment.
They are disputing that service has been effected in the current bankruptcy
proceedings.  According to the
defendants this was the first notice they had of
the default judgment.  On 19 October 1998 the defendants filed this notice of
motion
to set the default judgment aside and sought leave to file a defence.

<P>

17  	I turn to consider whether the defendants have a bona fide
defence.  The defendants say that they have been shown a document
by their
solicitor which purports to be a deed of guarantee from themselves to the
Commonwealth Bank in respect of money s advanced
to Kidz.  They say that this
is the first time that they have seen these documents and that the signatures
that appear on the document
and guarantee are not their signatures.  They say
that they have not guaranteed the payments of moneys by that company to the
Commonwealth
Bank.  (I shall refer to the handwriting experts' evidence later
in this judgment).
<P>

18  	The defendants admit that they had previously given personal
guarantees to the ANZ bank but say that after doing so, decided
that they would
not provide personal guarantees in the future.  Kidz was involved in the
manufacturing and retailing of children's
clothes.  In December 1995 Kidz had 4
retail outlets at Parramatta, Hurstville, Miranda and Penrith.  The company
needed to borrow
money to pay for the fitting out of the Penrith shop.  At that
time the company owed $130,000 to a firm called "It Fits" and $60,000
to the
ANZ bank.
<P>

19  	The first defendant admitted that he knew security would need to
be given for the loan to be approved and it needed to be satisfactory
to both
the company and the bank.  Both defendants realised the importance of obtaining
this loan.  The first defendant does not
recall a meeting which took place at
the company's factory at Lansvale with Mr Asciak who then held the position of
Business Development
Officer of the Parramatta branch.  However, the first
defendant does recall discussions with Mr Asciak about the loan (t 7).
According
to the first defendant, Mr Asciak told him that he required a bank
guarantee from the defendants and the first defendant replied
that they would
not sign a personal guarantee.  The first defendant does not depose to this
conversation in his affidavit.  
<P>

20  	The first defendant admitted that he signed a Privacy Act
consent in favour of the Commonwealth Development Bank next to the
words
guarantor and below the term "Guarantor".  Full names and addresses of
guarantors and then the names of the first defendant
and his wife also appear
on that document.  The first defendant acknowledged that he read that document
before signing it.  The second
defendant recalled a meeting between Mr Asciak
at the factory.  She said that she left the business arrangements to her
husband and
signed documents when advised to do so by her husband (the first
defendant).  She did not take an active role in the conversation
and could not
recall the details of the conversation.  
<P>

21  	Mr Asciak's version of events is that in December 1995 he
visited the factory premises.  He recalled that during this meeting
he said to
the defendants that the bank would require personal guarantees from both
directors and that this was a normal requirement.
 Neither defendants said
anything in response to this that indicated that they would not be prepared to
give personal guarantees.
 
<P>

22  	The defendants subsequently signed an application for finance
dated 17 January 1996.  Paragraph 5(b) of that application for
finance required
the defendants to enter into a joint and several guarantee for $241,000 by Iyad
Rafidi and Tina Rafidi.  Both defendants
gave evidence that they had no
difficulty reading the English language.  The first defendant admitted that he
read most of the relevant
parts of the document and although he believed he
read para (5) he does not recall noticing the reference to the personal
guarantee.
 
<P>

23  	Both parties admit signing the application for finance.  Also on
17 January 1996 the parties admit to signing a number of documents
such as an
equitable mortgage, a document entitled composite authority, a request to
complete and pay, solvency statement, statutory
declaration, four letters of
request and indemnity, a guarantee drawing authority.  The defendants said that
they signed the documents
at the office of Mr Chapman the company's financial
adviser.  The first defendant signed and the second defendant attended Mr
Chapman's
office later as both defendants could not be away from the factory at
the same time.  The defendants admitted affixing their signatures
on the back
page of the guarantee but they deny signing the guarantee at the foot of page
5.  Additionally, both defendants deny
placing the initials in the margin at
para 5 of the document.
<P>

24  	The first defendant identified his signature and recognised the
signature of his wife on the last page of the guarantee.  The
first defendant
thought the last page of the guarantee may have been given to him separately.
This cannot be correct as the document
is folded and the last page is printed
on both sides with the disputed signatures on one side and the other signatures
referred to
above on the other side of the page.  The first defendant said that
he relied on his financial adviser, Mr Chapman.  It was Mr Chapman
who gave him
the documents which he signed, except the personal guarantee which he refused
to sign.  The first defendant now believes
that the signatures on the second
last page of the guarantee are that of Mr Chapman.  The first defendant does
not remember how long
it took to sign the documents but estimates it took an
hour or two.  He does not recall whether he signed the documents in the morning
or the afternoon.
<P>

25  	The first defendant's explanation as to why he signed the
document when he was not prepared to give a guarantee was that Mr
Asciak said
that he understood that the defendants were not going to give a personal
guarantee but were going to do a financial check
on then before the creation of
a loan (t 9.35-40).  This conversation also does not appear in the first
defendant's affidavit.  The
first defendant maintains that although it was very
obvious to him that the document was a guarantee and even though his signature
appears on the guarantee and that he read it before signing it he did not want
to sign the guarantee and only did so because he was
assured that at the end of
the day they would not be signing a guarantee (t 18).  He also did not
appreciate that he was signing
a guarantee because his business consultant Mr
Chapman understood he would not be signing any guarantee documents (t 17).  The
first
defendant also admitted that he signed the guarantee in four other
places.  The first defendant conceded that he never wrote back
to the bank
informing it that he had not agreed to give a personal guarantee.  
<P>

26  	Mrs Rafidi, the second defendant relied on her husband's advice
because he was responsible for the business side of things
and she would sign
the documents her husband told her to sign.  According to the second defendant
before she went into Mr Chapman's
office her husband said "Go in.  Be very
careful, don't sign any personal guarantees as we discussed."  She replied
"That's fine."
(t 41).  Of course this cannot be the literal truth as it was
both defendants' evidence that they went to Mr Chapman's office separately.
She said that on 17 January 1996 she knew she needed to sign documentation to
obtain the loan.  "To be honest" she did not read the
documentation because she
had been too busy in the factory.  Mr Chapman took phone calls and in between
then he would say "sign here
Tina."  She noticed that her husband had told her
not sign a personal guarantee.  Her husband had not signed the second last
page.
 Mr Chapman said to her "We'll have to call him back in.  Aren't you
going to sign it?"  She replied "No.  I don't trust any gentlemen."
 Then Mr
Chapman had a few words to say about men and women.  He then said "Are going to
sign it or not."  According to the second
defendant, Mr Chapman was very abrupt
and he did not like her.  Despite the second defendant's perception that Mr
Chapman did not
like her, he apparently asked her out to lunch afterwards.  The
second defendant was upset at receiving this invitation and this
caused her to
remember the signing of the guarantee.  None of these conversations between her
husband and herself, herself and Mr
Chapman are referred to in her affidavit.
At this stage it is appropriate to record my impression of the second
defendant's demeanour.
 She appeared anxious to tell the court that she had
been told by her husband not to sign a guarantee.
<P>

27  	In relation to the second defendant's signature on page 6 of the
guarantee, the handwriting experts Mr Westwood and Ms Winter
agree that the
questioned signatures in the name Tina Rafidi were written by the person who
wrote the specimen Tina Rafidi signatures.
 As Mrs Rafidi signed the specimen
signatures, there is no expert evidence to support the second defendant's
assertion that she did
not sign the guarantee at the foot of page 5.  It is
inconceivable that someone forged her initials in the margin at para (5) of
the
guarantee.
<P>

28  	The handwriting experts also agree that the questioned Iyad
Rafidi signature on page 6 of the guarantee was written by the
person who wrote
the specimen Iyad Rafidi signatures.  The only substantive issue they are not
in complete agreement, is in respect
of opinions regarding the initials and
signature in the name of Iyad Rafidi on pages 2 and 5 respectively of the
subject guarantee.
 In Mr Westwood's view the initials on page 2 may well have
been written by the writer of the specimen Iyad Rafidi signatures, and
the
questioned signature on page 5 was probably written by the writer.  Ms Winter
was unable to reach a conclusion one way or the
other on the issue.  This
evidence does not support the first defendant's version that it was not his
signature on page 5.
<P>

29  	There are some difficulties with the defendants' version of
events.  The events surrounding the signing of the guarantee make
the first
defendant's explanation as to the signature on the second last page not being
his, implausible.  He was an experienced
businessman.  On 17 January 1996  he
signed at least 10 documents in order to obtain the loan, yet did not place his
initials on
the guarantee at paragraph (5) nor did he sign on the second last
page but turned the document over and signed the last page.  When
giving
evidence, he did not display any difficulty recognising documents or answering
questions in relation to them.  He admitted
he was familiar with and recognised
a personal guarantee.  
<P>

30  	There were also inconsistencies in the first defendant's
evidence.  The first defendant gave evidence that they moved out of
the
property in July 1996 at a time when they were experiencing financial
difficulty and the house was to be put on the market. 
His wife did not want to
stay in the property with people going through it.  He said that he told the
ANZ bank that he had moved
and gave it his new address.  He returned to the
house every 3 weeks or so to mow the lawn and clean up.  He kept the
electricity
connected because he had lighting going on and off and the fridge
had a few drinks it.  There was no-one living in the house but
the furniture
was left in there.  He does not recall when he had the mail re-directed but he
found mail in the letter box from time
to time which he handed to his
solicitor.  He was not sure if the telephones lines remained connected between
July 1996 to December
1996.  He does not remember receiving a s 57(2)(b) notice
but if he had received it he would have handed it over to his solicitor.
 
<P>

31  	The first defendant conceded that he may not have told his
solicitor that he had moved.  In relation to the first defendant
informing the
ANZ bank of his change of address, there is correspondence addressed to the
first defendant at 6 Mataro Close, Edensor
Park between 14 January 1997 and 17
October 1997.  The bank's letter of 14 January 1997 refers to a round table
meeting to attempt
to come to a commercial settlement in relation to money owed
by the Rafidi group of accounts to the bank.  The negotiations resulted
in a
settlement which was later dishonoured.  Be that as it may, it is clear that
the first defendant received correspondence at
the property in order to follow
up the bank's offer.  This correspondence commenced 7 months after the first
defendant allegedly
left the property.  Also it is clear that the first
defendant did not tell the ANZ bank throughout this period that he had moved
premises.
<P>

32  	The first defendant was asked in cross examination how could he
explain his electricity bill of $300 in November 1996.  He
remembered that the
prior electricity bills were in the order of $700.  However the electricity
account revealed a different scenario.
 In April 1996 the electricity account
was in the sum of $404.35, at as June 1996 the account was for the sum of
$340.20 and up to
September 1996, the account was in the sum of $309.25.  The
electricity bill did not decrease markedly during the period when the
defendants had allegedly moved out of the premises.
<P>

33  	I turn now to consider whether the defendants have explained the
delay in moving to set aside the default judgment.  As previously
stated the
defendants in their affidavits depose that they only became aware of the
default judgment in August 1998 when the bankruptcy
notices were forwarded to
them by the first defendant's father.  This version of events is at odds with a
letter by the defendants'
solicitor to the plaintiff's solicitor dated 14
August 1997 (annexure B to the first defendant's affidavit of 25 November 1998)
which
referred to the default judgment having been entered.  When confronted
with this evidence both defendants conceded that in August
1997 they knew about
the default judgment being entered.  But their motion to set aside judgment was
not filed until over a year
later, namely on 19 October 1998.  It is my view
that the defendants caused this motion to be filed after the bankruptcy notice
was
served on them in a bid to stave off the bankruptcy proceedings.  They have
not provided an adequate explanation for their delay.
<P>

34  	I cannot accept that the defendants were giving frank and
truthful evidence.  They both gave evidence under cross examination
which
conflicted with their affidavit evidence on a number of matters.  One topic was
when they became aware of the default judgment
being entered.  The second
defendant gave evidence of a critical conversation in relation to the signing
of the guarantee which did
not appear in her affidavit.  The first defendant
also gave evidence of a conversation relating to the guarantee which did not
appear
in his affidavit.  The first defendant gave inconsistent evidence about
informing the ANZ bank of his change of address and the electricity
accounts.
The version of events of the defendants that caused them to not sign the
guarantee at para (5) nor initial para (5) and
not sign at the foot of page 5
yet signed in four other places is implausible.  The expert evidence does not
support the defendants'
contentions.  Although there is some evidence by Mr
Manna and Mr Heness which may assist the defendants, I have reluctantly come
to
the conclusion on the balance of probabilities that the defendants do not have
a bona fide defence.  Nor have the defendants furnished
an adequate explanation
in the delay in moving to set aside default judgment.  Justice is best served
if the default judgment is
not set aside.  I dismiss the motion with costs.
<P>

35  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The notice of motion filed 19 October 1998 is dismissed.
<P>

(2)	The defendants are to pay the plaintiff's costs.
