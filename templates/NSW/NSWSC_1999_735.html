<b>THURSDAY 15 JULY 1999</b>

<b>2869/99 - LANDSMITHS PTY LTD V ENID ELIZABETH HALL</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:  T</b>his is a suit for specific performance
of an alleged agreement for lease.  Up until 30 June this year the plaintiff
was a tenant of
the defendant, and occupied shops 1 and 2, 73 Bold Street,
Laurieton.  The plaintiff had an option to renew, but it is common ground
that
it did not exercise that option.
<P>

2   	The plaintiff made it clear to the defendant in the second
quarter of 1999 that it wished to expand its business and would
also wish to
take a lease of shop 3 at that address, which is also owned by the defendant
and which is currently occupied by a dentist
who is holding over on a month to
month basis.
<P>

3   	Eventually the parties reached a consensus on a new lease
at a rent of $1300 per month for five years with a five year option.
 There was
then a conversation between them about 1 May in which Mr John Smith, who was
negotiating on behalf of the plaintiff, told
the defendant he only wanted a
three by three lease now as his belief was the GST would not be coming into
effect.  The defendant
said that she did not think she had much choice.  There
was then some discussion about air-conditioning and the parties left it on
the
basis that the defendant's solicitor, George Searson, would be submitting a
formal lease.
<P>

4   	Mr Searson did submit a lease on 25 May.  The draft is not
in evidence, but it would seem that the rent was $1400 per month
and the draft
had a GST related clause in it.  Mr Smith wrote and phoned to the effect that
he would like that clause removed and
the rent stated as $1300 as agreed.  Mr
Searson's firm wrote back on 27 May enclosing an amended annexure A.
<P>

5   	The evidence makes it clear that there was some
conversation between the parties that the lease had to be signed and returned
no later than Friday 28 May 1999.  It is not completely clear to me what
exactly was said, or what its effect was.
<P>

6   	On the Friday between 10 and 11 in the morning, the
plaintiff's representative delivered leases executed by himself and Mr
Paul
Hancox, the other director of the plaintiff, to the defendant's solicitor,
together with a cheque for stamp duty and disbursements.
 Unfortunately, the
clerk who received it merely put it on another clerk's desk and did not direct
Mr Searson's attention to the
fact that it had arrived.  When the defendant
rang the solicitors she was told that the lease had not arrived and over the
following
weekend she entered into, it would seem, binding arrangements with a
third party.  Accordingly, she has declined to sign the lease
and the plaintiff
wants specific performance.
<P>

7   	 The courts have on very many occasions had to deal with
allegations that a series of conversations, or exchange of documents
between
parties, have amounted to a binding contract in circumstances where ordinarily
parties perfect their negotiations by a formal
contract.  In particular these
problems concern contracts for sale of land or contracts for leases.
<P>

8   	The way in which all these problems are resolved is to see
what were the intentions of the parties.  However, to divine those
intentions
the court applies a series of guidelines and asks itself certain questions.
<P>

9   	The cases show that the court is entitled to assume that
where there is a contract for the sale of land or a lease for three
years or
more, the parties normally intend to have a formal document, in the case of a
lease because it has to be registered.  Again,
the cases show that it is more
likely than not that in such a situation the parties do not intend to be bound
until the formal document
has been exchanged.  This is the case with leases:
<b> Blackburn Developments No 19 Pty Ltd v Downs Surgical (Australia) Pty
Ltd</b> (1974) 2 BPR 9141.  I applied that case in<b> Arjay Investments Pty Ltd
v Morrison's Outdoor Catering Pty Ltd</b>, 1 May 1995, unreported, and further
said in that case that one also looks to see whether the parties have involved
solicitors in
the transaction, and that the mere fact that they have hit upon a
price or have worked out the basic conditions of their agreement
does not
necessarily indicate that they have reached a legally binding agreement.
<P>

10   	As McLelland CJ in Eq said in<b> Kassabian v Lagonicos
(</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1993%29%20NSW%20Conv%20R%2055%2d690" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1993) NSW Conv R 55-690</a>, 55,943:
<P>

"There must be more than the arrival by the parties at a consensus.  The
parties must intend that the consensus at which they have
arrived should there
and then constitute a binding contract."
<P>

11   	With this background I look at the facts of the case. The
facts are that both Mr Smith and Mrs Hall were very astute people,
familiar
with property transactions.  They were intending that the defendant's solicitor
would prepare a formal lease.  It is more
likely than not that the plaintiff,
being an agent, knew that leases for three years with an option would need to
be registered and
be in proper form.
<P>

12   	The defendant's solicitor on 25 May submitted a form of
lease.  The lease, as would be expected, contained clauses fleshing
out the
consensus that had been reached earlier in the month and was submitted on the
basis that it was subject to the lessor's approval.
 The solicitor also
reserved the right to make any alteration or additions to the lease.
<P>

13   	The plaintiff felt no compunction in saying "we would like
special condition 15.4 removed from the lease", but did not indicate
that there
was any pre-existing agreement that that was the case and, indeed, proceeded on
the basis it had liberty to negotiate
the conditions.
<P>

14   	Mr Sanderson, who appeared for the plaintiff, puts some
store on the fact that the defendant's solicitor's letter of 27 May
did not
continue to reserve the right to make alterations and that the document was
subject to the lessor's approval, but in the
flow of correspondence it does not
appear to me that that omission has any significance.
<P>

15   	 The defendant's solicitor never had any authority to
conclude a deal.  His authority was only to submit a draft lease.  This
he did.
It is not completely clear that even if the landlord had known that the lease
had been returned on Friday the 28th that she
necessarily would have signed it.
She said in the witness box that she never allowed people to deal independently
with her own property,
she dealt with it herself.
<P>

16   	In the circumstances I cannot see how the parties intended
that what they said to each other in the conversation to which
I have referred
made a binding agreement to lease which then and there bound them both.  The
most it amounts to was a consensus as
to the principal matters to which they
would agree to be the subject of a formal lease and I do not consider that
there was a lease
until that event occurred.  It never occurred.
<P>

17   	Even if there had been an agreement for lease, it still
would not have been enforceable, in my view, because of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s54a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 54A</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a>.  The only possible note or memorandum required by that
section could be the solicitor's letter of 27 May, which impliedly republished
the draft lease with an amended annexure A.  The document was still not
completely correct as the commencement date would have to
be 7 July because the
dentist's lease would not have expired until the 6th and there may have been
other small drafting problems,
but putting those aside there was no authority
in the solicitor to enter into a lease as there was in<b> Kalnenas v
Kovacevich</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1961%5d%20WAR%20182" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1961] WAR 182.</a> That authority seems to be the basis upon which
Jackson SPJ held that the solicitor's letter in that case could constitute a
note
or memorandum in writing; see<b> Stewart Upton Pty Ltd v Pindar</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20NSW%20Conv%20R%2055%2d529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990)
NSW Conv R 55-529</a>, p 58,939.
<P>

18   	For these reasons the present proceedings must be
dismissed with costs.   The exhibit may be returned.
