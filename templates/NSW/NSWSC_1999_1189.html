<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b> <b>(T2912 - admissibility of evidence)</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  It seems clear to me on authorities that have
been exhaustively dealt with, including <b><i>Hughes</i></b> case, that the
plaintiff can call evidence demonstrating a person's contemporaneous reaction
to the publication of the matter complained
of.
<P>

2   	The witness (Mr Fitzgibbon) has given evidence that within
days of the broadcast Councillor Carver stated to him words to the
effect that
the Council should review the relationship with Marsdens because of the
possibility, and I say that subject to correction
as to the detail of the
evidence, that the relationship would be a source of embarrassment to the
Council.  That was within days
of the broadcast.
<P>

3   	On 27 August, three months after the broadcast, the same
councillor, it is said, moved a Motion that the Council review its
panel of
solicitors.
<P>

4   	An amendment was moved calling for expressions of interest
in the Council's legal work.  That amendment became the Motion,
and it was
carried.
<P>

5   	As I understand it, the evidence would establish that
historically, Marsdens had been engaged for three years in circumstances
where
within that period it would not otherwise have expected a review of its
position.  Next, there was a call for tenders; Marsdens
tendered and apparently
was successful.
<P>

6   	This evidence certainly appears to me to be relevant to the
issue that hitherto has been described as "<i>shunning" </i>but, as Mr Hall
quite rightly put it, that word has become somewhat loosely used in this case
to encompass the "<i>hostile contemporaneous reaction"</i>.
<P>

7   	Contemporaneity of course has been dealt with hitherto, and
a lot of the evidence is concerned with events that happened months,
indeed
years, after the relevant broadcast. If events after the relevant broadcast,
say in terms of months, on a rational basis can
be linked back to a statement
made within days of the broadcast, what happened some months later might be
regarded as still an appropriate
hostile reaction.
<P>

8   	This evidence to me is relevant on that issue, is
admissible on that issue; whether it proves very much on that issue in the
end
remains to be seen, and I will admit it.
<P>
