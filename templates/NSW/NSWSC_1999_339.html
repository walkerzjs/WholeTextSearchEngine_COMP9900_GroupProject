<i>Thursday, 15 April 1999</i>
<P>

<b>1018/99	SHIRLEY LENORE MARTIN   -v-   CARLA GENTILINI &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b> By notice of motion filed on 19 March 1999
the plaintiff, Shirley Lenore Martin, as administrator of the estate of Vinicio
Nello
Cenedese, seeks orders that judgment be entered for the plaintiff on her
claim pursuant to Part 13 of the Rules; that the defence
be struck out, the
cross-claim be struck out, and judgment be entered for the cross-defendant on
the cross-claim.
<P>

2   	There has also been filed in Court an amended notice of
motion by the plaintiff, which includes, as paragraph 1A, an order
that
judgment be entered for the plaintiff pursuant to Part 18 rule 3 of the
Rules.
<P>

3   	At the commencement of the hearing Counsel for the
plaintiff informed the Court that the application was grounded not only
on Part
13 of the Rules, which Part relates to summary disposal of proceedings, but
also upon Part 18 rule 3, which rule relates
to judgments on admissions. 
<P>

4   	The statement of claim was filed on 6 January 1999. It is
asserted in that pleading that Vinicio Nello Cenedese (referred to
therein as
"the deceased") provided the entirety of the purchase price of somewhat under
$120,000 for the purchase of a property
situate at and known as 20 George
Street, Port Macquarie, of which property the defendants, Carla Gentilini and
Paula Cazzioli, are
the registered proprietors.
<P>

5   	The plaintiff asserts in paragraph 1 of the statement of
claim an interest that, in the premises, the defendants hold the land
as
trustees for the estate of the deceased.
<P>

6   	By their defence, which was filed on 26 February 1999, the
defendants admitted paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, paragraphs 5 to 11 inclusive,
and
paragraph 13 of the statement of claim, and (subject to a matter which is not
of any materiality in the substance) also paragraph
4.  The assertion, which is
an assertion of law, contained in paragraph 12 of the statement of claim (that
the defendants hold the
land as trustees for the estate of the deceased) is the
only matter in the statement of claim which is denied in the defence.
<P>

7   	Part 18 rule 3 of the Supreme Court Rules provides in
subrule (1):
<P>

Where admissions are made by a party, whether by his pleading or otherwise, the
Court may, on the application of any other party,
give any judgment or make any
order to which the applicant is entitled on the admissions.
<P>

8   	The plaintiff submitted that, upon the matters admitted and
upon the assertions of the claim which are expressly admitted by
the defence,
the plaintiff is entitled to judgment that the defendants as the registered
proprietors of the subject property hold
that property on a resulting trust for
the person who provided the entirety of the purchase price of that property,
being the deceased;
and, since he is now dead, on a resulting trust for his
estate.
<P>

9   	No part of the defence addresses itself to any matter which
would tend to rebut that consequence of a resulting trust in favour
of the
deceased.
<P>

10   	During the course of submissions Counsel for the
defendants received from me a clear indication that if the pleadings remained
in the form in which they presently stand I would be disposed to make an order
of the nature now sought by the plaintiff for judgment
for the plaintiff upon
the admissions made by the defendants in the defence.  In response Counsel for
the defendants has now sought,
in effect, that I should not proceed to a final
determination upon the notice of motion which is presently before me, but that
I
should give to the defendants an opportunity to re-plead their defence to
raise matters which would, so it is submitted, tend to
rebut the consequence of
a resulting trust. That appears to me to be the clear consequence of the facts
alleged by the plaintiff
in the statement of claim which are expressly admitted
by the defendants in their defence.
<P>

11   	The plaintiff opposes such a course and opposes any such
leave being granted to the defendants to file an amended defence.
Nevertheless, it seems to me that it is appropriate that leave should be
granted. Since the plaintiff has not seen any draft of such
an amended defence
it is appropriate that the present notice of motion remain on foot.
<P>

12   	However, as I have already indicated, the leave which is
sought by the defendant will be granted only upon terms that the
defendants pay
the costs of the plaintiff's notice of motion up to and including today's
hearing.
<P>

13   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	Upon the application of the defendants, which is opposed by the plaintiff, I
order that the amended notice of motion filed by
the plaintiff on 15 April 1999
be stood over generally, with liberty to restore to the Registrar's list on
seven days notice.
<P>

2.	I order that leave be and hereby is granted to the defendants to file and
serve an amended defence and cross-claim on or before
Thursday, 6 May 1999.
<P>

3.	I order that the costs of the notice of motion filed by the plaintiff on 19
March 1999 and of the aforesaid amended notice of
motion up to and including
today be paid by the defendants.
<P>

4.	I grant leave to the plaintiff to proceed forthwith to assessment of the
foregoing costs.
<P>
