<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  On 3 February 1999, four out of an anticipated eight preliminary
matters were dealt with prior to the commencement
of the hearing of the trial
of these actions presently listed for Monday, 8 February.  
<P>

2	The <b>first matter</b> can be broadly described as the question of
<b>consolidation</b>. Separate actions were commenced by the plaintiff in
relation to two publications, one in 1995 and one in 1996.  It can generally
be
stated that the issues in each action are substantially the same in terms of
pleaded imputations and contextual imputations, and
the only issue for the jury
presently in each case is whether or not the matter complained of carries the
imputations pleaded by
the plaintiff and whether they are defamatory.
<P>

3	Shortly stated, the defendant's position is that there should be empanelled a
separate jury to make the determinations under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act</a> in
respect of each publication; otherwise all remaining issues for determination
by the trial judge can be made by the actions being
heard together.  
<P>

4	It is argued that by the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> (4)(a)(i), the definition of
"<i>proceedings"</i>, and s 88B of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></i>, together with
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act</a> </i>compels recourse to separate juries.  I do
not agree. Separate "<i>actions" </i>may well have been commenced but the
"<i>proceedings", </i>in the end, will be constituted by the hearing together
of the two separately instituted actions.  That such a course can be taken
and
brought about is clear from the operation of SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31</a> r 38.
<P>

5	Secondly, it was contended that where the question of fact as to the carrying
of imputations is concerned with what I will describe
as, "<i>transient</i>"
publications, separate juries should be empanelled for each, particularly as in
these proceedings the telecasts were approximately
a year apart. It is
suggested that otherwise the Court could not be satisfied that the jury
deciding the question of fact in respect
of the 1996 telecast was not affected
by a residual impression of words or images arising from the telecast the
subject of the 1995
proceedings (see <b><i>Amalgamated Television Services Pty
Limited v Marsden</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20158" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 158</a> at 165-166 per Hunt CJ at CL).
<P>

6	The question of "<i>capacity" </i>to carry imputations  and the question of
whether "<i>in fact</i>" they are conveyed are quite separate, as Hunt CJ at CL
makes clear.  It has not been uncommon for juries in defamation actions,
that
is a single jury, to determine whether in fact several publications convey the
individually relevant imputations.
<P>

7	The jury will receive instructions and directions as to the necessary
separate consideration of each publication and will no doubt
be addressed on
the same subject matter by counsel.  I see no risk in any sense of the kind
adverted to by counsel for the defendant.
<P>

8	The consideration the jury will give to each publication can be regarded as
far more focused than, for example, the consideration
a jury gives in a
criminal trial where multiple counts are involved and where that consideration
is given after a body of evidence
is called in relation to each count.
<P>

9	Being of the view therefore that there is no statutory requirement for the
separate jury, I am not persuaded that there is any
risk of injustice to either
party, and particularly the defendant, by a course being adopted that conforms
with the sensible and
efficient conduct of the administration of justice in a
case such as this.  The course proposed by the defendant would be inimical
in
my view to the fair and efficient dispatch of the Court's business in
litigation of this kind.
<P>

10	Accordingly I will order that the proceedings be heard at the same time.
The evidence in one will be available as evidence in
the other subject to any
matter of relevance that may discretely arise and the determinations to be made
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act</a></i> will be made by the one jury empanelled
to hear and determine those issues in the proceedings.
<P>

11	The <b>second matter</b> was concerned with <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ja197791/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 38</a> (8) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ja197791/" class="autolink_findacts">Jury</i>
<i>Act</a></i></b><i> </i>which provides:  
<P>

	<i>"Before the selection of the jury at a civil trial, the judge must, subject
to the regulations:</i>
<P>

	<i>(a)	direct the parties to the proceedings to inform the jurors on the panel
of the nature of the action and the identity of the parties
and of the
principal witnesses to be called by the parties, and;</i>
<P>

	<i>(b)	call on the jurors on the panel to apply to be excused if they consider
that they are not able to give impartial consideration
to the case".</i>
<P>

12	No relevant regulations have been made.
<P>

13	On reading the section one can come to the view that it is fairly stark in
its mandatory terms and there is "<i>no way around it."  </i>I say that in the
sense that in these proceedings, save for the tender of the video tapes of the
telecasts, there will be no evidence
called on the issue which the jury has to
decide.  
<P>

14	The position taken by the defendant is that there are no "<i>principal
witnesses</i>" to be called by the parties on the issue that the jury has to
decide and thus the jury should be informed of no more than the identity
of the
parties and the nature of the action.
<P>

15	It seems clear to me that the mischief at which the amendment is aimed is to
obviate the situation whereby, in the performance
of its function, the jury
could be compromised by  the late disclosure, for example, of a relationship
between a juror and a party
or a witness thereby necessitating the discharge of
that jury.  I do not see how the impartial consideration of the issues to be
decided by the jury under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act</a></i> can be affected by
the failure to identify witnesses whom the jury will not hear and whose
evidence will have nothing to do with
the issue the jury has to decide.
<P>

16	The indication to the jury of the nature of the issue they have to decide in
the defamation action brought by Mr Marsden against
Channel 7 with respect to
the two programs in my view provides a sufficient safeguard against perils for
the obviation of which the
amendment was made.
<P>

17	The impartiality of the jury's consideration of the issue they have to
decide, as I have said, cannot be affected in any rational
way by the
identification of witnesses from whom it will not hear and whose testimony will
in no way go to the issue it has to decide.
<P>

18	The identity of parties and particularly the plaintiff and the nature of the
action and of the issue the jury has to decide whether
the programs convey
certain meanings and whether they are defamatory, in my view, will be
sufficient. The plaintiff through its counsel
has expressed anxiety to have
identified the witnesses the defendant proposes to call.  There is no present
entitlement to that information.
 There is no entitlement I have ruled under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ja197791/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
38(8)</a> of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ja197791/" class="autolink_findacts">Jury Act</a></i> in any indirect way.
<P>

19	I add that for the jury to be provided with more information than that which
I have outlined above and in particular the names
of principal witnesses could
be quite counterproductive to the objective sought to be attained by the
amended legislation.  The jury
might well be led down the improper path of
speculation as to what the conceivable connection is between identified
witnesses and
the issue it has to decide <i>a fortiori</i> when it will not
have heard anything from the witnesses whose names have been announced.  In my
respectful view the legislature can
be said to have failed to have taken into
account the peculiarities that arise by reason of the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act</i> 1974</a> in effecting amendments to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ja197791/" class="autolink_findacts">Jury Act</a> in this
regard.
<P>

20	The <b>third matter</b> raised was not unconnected with the second and is
not unconnected with an application, which at the time of preparing these
reasons
and delivering them, I anticipate will shortly be made on behalf of the
plaintiff.  The application dealt with on 3 February was
to the effect that the
defendant should be directed to present its case on justification in an orderly
way comprising the <b>grouping of witnesses</b> complainant by complainant, as
it were.  Pausing there, that of course makes sense and would make the judge's
task easier.  The plaintiff
however requires not only that orderly presentation
but <b>the list of witnesses and the order in which they will be called</b> on
the basis that this is in effect a criminal trial as to the issue of
justification and one in which, unlike criminal proceedings
in the strict
sense, the plaintiff has not received the "<i>full Crown brief</i>", but
rather, only, it is said, the barest outline by way of  particulars of the
facts, matters and circumstances upon which the
defendant proposes to rely.
<P>

21	It is argued for the plaintiff that such directions could be given under SCR
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ja197791/index.html#p26" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 26</a> r 1 or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ja197791/index.html#p36" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 36</a> r 4A (subject to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>, one would assume).  I
propose to defer ruling in this regard until I have heard the substance of the
anticipated application for
the plaintiff.  That application, as I understand
it, will relate to the whole structure of the conduct of the trial in terms of
the leading of evidence by each side upon certain issues not the least of which
will be justification.  I consider it appropriate
that that aspect should be
resolved, if it can be resolved, by a ruling of this Court before giving any
directions as to the disclosure
of identity of witnesses and the order in which
they should be called.
<P>

22	The <b>fourth matter</b> related to <b>interrogatories</b>.  On 11 December
1998 orders were made requiring the plaintiff to serve any further
interrogatories by 5pm on the 17th of that month
and the defendant to answer
them by 5pm on 31 December.  Other orders were made in relation to the
defendant providing documents
on discovery.  A specific order in relation to 40
video tapes to be provided by noon on 14 December 1998 also was made.  Liberty
to apply on a half day's notice was granted and apparently has not been
exercised otherwise than in the application I heard on 3
February.
<P>

23	Three sets of interrogatories were delivered by the plaintiff in each
action.  The first dated 9 December; the second 17 December
- that is both
within the time allowed by the order - and the third on 24 December.  In
relation to the first two sets of interrogatories
the defendant has answered
some and has objected to answering others.  As I understand it, the position in
relation to the third
set of interrogatories is that no answers have been
provided.  
<P>

24	The defendant takes the approach that the interrogatories are
"<i>unnecessary</i>" (see SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/index.html#p37" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 37</a> rr 3 and 5) and submits that I should
reject them on a global basis.  I have been referred to various statements of
disapprobation
in relation to the delivery of prolix and what are said to be
"<i>unnecessary" </i>interrogatories, which statements must of course be viewed
in the context of the several cases to which I was referred: <b><i>Packer v
Australian Broadcasting Corporation</i></b> (Master Hogan, Supreme Court of
Act, 31 March 1993);  <b><i>Carnell v Spier </i></b>(Miles CJ, Supreme Court
VACT, 3 June 1997);  <b><i>Ryan v Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty
Limited</i></b> (Miles CJ, 13 November 1990);  <b><i>Aspar Autobarn
Co-operative Society &amp; Ors v Dovala Pty Limited </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2016%20FCR%20284" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 16 FCR 284</a>
per Woodward J;  <b><i>Boxall v Mayne </i></b>(Supreme Court of Tasmania, 29
May 1997) per Zeeman J;  <b><i>American Flange Manufacturing Co v Rheem
Australia Pty Limited (No. 2)</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281965%29%20NSWR%20193" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1965) NSWR 193</a>;  and <b><i>De Danske
Hedeselkabet v KDM International Plc </i></b>(1994) 2 Lloyds Law Reports
534.
<P>

25	The plaintiff relies upon the decision of Hunt J in <b><i>Palmer v John
Fairfax and Sons Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20727" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 727</a> in support of the bulk of
the interrogatories going to the issue of qualified privilege.
<P>

26	On the one hand, as Mr Wheelhouse quite correctly submitted, there must be
some link between the interrogatories taken to be
in their proper form
(<b><i>Sharpe v Smail</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%205%20ALR%20377" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 5 ALR 377)</a> and some issue between the
parties, and of course the interrogatories must not be fishing.
<P>

27	Taking a global approach I do propose to order the defendant to answer
further interrogatories, but not all of those to which
they hitherto have
objected.  The discovery process including interrogatories has been late and
hurried.  The trial will not unduly
be disrupted by the defendant being
required to provide further answers and such time should be available during
the litigation -
sufficient time should be available at least during the
litigation of  the fundamentally advocacy point under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A</a> of <i>the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation
Act</a></i> - to enable those advising the defendant to devote resources to
providing further answers.
<P>

28	Accordingly in relation to the interrogatories delivered on 9 December the
defendant in each action is directed to provide answers
only to interrogatories
23, 30 and 31.
<P>

29	In relation to the 1995 action, and the interrogatories delivered on 17
December 1998 the defendant is directed to provide answers
to interrogatories
1, 5, 6 and 7.  I note that interrogatories 10, 11(c), 12 and 13 are not
pressed. In the 1996 action the defendant
is directed to provide answers to all
interrogatories in respect of which objection hitherto has been taken.
<P>

30	The defendant has given discovery of documents.  The examples shown to me
were documents bearing numbers 19, 40 and 55 are on
their face are meaningless
and I am of the view that the plaintiff is entitled to interrogate the
plaintiff as to the matters the
subject of the disputed interrogatories to seek
relevant admissions as to any one of the issues to which they can be taken to
relate
by reason of the discovery itself.  In any event, as I understand it the
defendant has given notice in correspondence of its intention
to endeavour to
ascertain the authorship of many of the documents referred to.
<P>

31	As to the interrogatories of the 24 December these essentially relate to
video tapes the subject of the orders to which I have
earlier referred and
which apparently were only received in the physical sense by the plaintiff
towards the end of December.  Objection
was taken by letter to the answering of
any of those interrogatories.  I am not persuaded that that objection is well
founded or
that it is inappropriate to order the defendant to answer the
interrogatories delivered on 24 December and I will order the defendant
to do
so.
<P>

32	I am not prepared to accept the submission for the defendant that
interrogatories can become less "<i>necessary"</i> the closer to the trial date
they are delivered.  Either they are necessary in the sense of being relevant
and in proper form or
they are not, in New South Wales.  In my view they are
necessary in that sense.  As I have indicated the time available is somewhat
flexible by reason of the jury involvement to the limited issue in this
litigation.  I propose therefore to order in the first instance
that the
defendant provide answers to the interrogatories by 5pm on Friday 12 February
1999.  I grant liberty to apply on one day's
notice in respect of any further
order in relation thereto.
