<u>21239/95   -   Burns v The Commonwealth of Australia</u>
<P>

<u>JUDGMENT</u>
<P>

1	These proceedings were commenced by Statement of Claim filed on 29 November
1995.  The plaintiff claims damages for personal injury.
 A cause of action
founded on negligence is alleged.
<P>

2	The defendant has filed both a Notice of Appearance and a Defence.  There are
a number of defences (including a defence founded
on the provisions of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act, 1969</a></i> (the <i>Act</i>)).
<P>

3	A Notice of Motion was filed on 6 December 1995.  It seeks, inter alia, an
order extending the relevant limitation period.  The
order is sought pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 60G</a> of the <i>Act</i>.
<P>

4	The plaintiff has sworn an affidavit.  On 10 February 1964, he was a member
of the crew of HMAS Melbourne when it collided with
HMAS Voyager.  The Court
has previously dealt with and granted many applications arising out of that
collision.
<P>

5	The affidavit contains, inter alia, the following:-
<P>

"6.	At the time of the collision I was in the starboard seaboat space waiting
to go on watch.  The HMAS Melbourne was in darkness
I was suddenly pitched
forward in the darkness.  I thought a plane had gone over the side.  I then saw
the outline of the stern section
of the Voyager scrape down the starboard side.
I was standing under the lifeboat and the superstructure of the Voyager struck
the
lifeboat above my head.  I was paralysed with fear and lost all body
sensation.  I thought the Voyager would explode.  I called out
to shipmates to
stand back.  I climbed into the lifeboat and called to the Sick Bay attendant
to get into the boat.  No-one knew
how to get the boat into the water.  I felt
useless and waited for the boat crew to come along and lower it.  I was then
told to
get out of the boat and they took over.  I then helped put scrambling
nets over the side and helped survivors getting up on the nets.
 I helped with
blankets for the survivors and was told to take buckets of hot water to the
hangar which had been set up as a sick
bay.  When I got there and saw all of
the survivors covered in oil I could not handle it and I put the buckets down
and left.  One
of my friends Barry Lane also known as Barry Sharkey was on the
Voyager and I later learned he had been killed.  This affected me
greatly.  I
had only been at sea for two nights when the collision occurred.
<P>

7.	I stayed in the Navy for another five years but I lost all ambition.  I had
no faith in the system.  I had intended making a
career of the Navy and hoped
to become an Officer.  After the collision I lost ambition.  I relived the
collision every day.  I became
aggressive and I could not deal with authority.
I had began to drink to excess.  I had difficulty with relationships and could
not
handle crowds.
<P>

8.	I was desperate to get out of the Navy but I could not find a way.  I came
under suspicion for allegedly taking drugs.  I was
not using drugs but I then
realised this would be a means of obtaining a discharge.  I went on leave in
early January 1969.  I came
back with long hair and dressed like a hippy.  I
pretended I was on drugs.  I was then transferred to the Navy hospital at HMAS
Penguin
and treated with a course of drugs.  I stayed in the hospital for
approximately one month.  After a further month on shore I was
discharged on
the basis of my unsuitability for the Navy.  This was in April 1969.  On one
hand I was greatly relieved when told
I was to be discharged but on the other
hand there was a feeling of great loss because my Navy career was over.  After
I left the
Navy I drifted around for a few months.  I came to Melbourne and
took a cleaning job at the Princess Theatre but only stayed for
a few weeks.  I
then moved from job to job staying only a few weeks in each.
<P>

9.	In 1970 I married but the relationship broke down and we parted in 1972.  I
found it extremely difficult to relate to people.
<P>

10.	The longest term of employment was with the Australian Academy of
Hairdressing where I worked as a cleaner.  This lasted for
three years but I
left on 2 December 1997.  I am currently unemployed in full time work and in
receipt of a Department of Veterans
Affairs Pension.
<P>

11.	Before the collision I was an innocent young kid with very little life
experience.  I was looking forward to a career in the
Navy.  I had wanted to be
in the Navy since I was ten years old but after the Voyager I just lost faith
in the system and had no
ambition at all.  I became very anxious and depressed
and lost confidence in myself.  I did not seek any medical help.  I did not
understand that the collision and its aftermath caused or was capable of
causing me psychiatric injury or damage.  I did not know
that the various
symptoms which I had experienced during my life since the sinking of the
Voyager were attributable to a psychiatric
disorder in particular Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder.
<P>

12.	In early 1995 I attended the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service in South
Melbourne for counselling and was told that I was
suffering from Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder.  Now produced and shown to me and marked `WTB2' is a copy of a
report from the Vietnam
Veterans Counselling Service dated 9 September 1996.  I
have read the report and save for minor immaterial discrepancies it accurately
records what I told my counsellor.
<P>

13.	Having consulted the Vietnam Veteran's Counselling Service I now have some
understanding of the effect the Voyager collision
had on my life."
<P>

6	The plaintiff gave brief supplementary oral evidence and was cross-examined.
Documentation (including a report from Dr Holwill
dated 30 November 1998) was
tendered on his behalf.  The defendant did not tender any affidavit material or
other documentation.
<P>

7	During the hearing, it was said that the issues were:-
<P>

1.	whether or not the threshold requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 60I</a> of the <i>Act</i>
had been satisfied; and 
<P>

2.	the discretionary consideration of the matter of prejudice.
<P>

8	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60I</a> prohibits the making of an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 60G</a> unless the
Court is satisfied of the matters listed in (a) and (b) thereof.
<P>

9	In the case of the matters listed in (a), the plaintiff relies on those
appearing in (i) and (ii).  There was a need to address
similar considerations
in <u>Darcy v The Commonwealth of Australia</u> (25 July 1997).  Ultimately,
the defendant made no submissions on the question of whether or not the
plaintiff had satisfied the
threshold requirements.  I am satisfied that the
plaintiff has met these requirements.
<P>

10	I now turn to the other matter argued (the question of prejudice).  This is
a question which excited limited argument only.
<P>

11	The plaintiff was discharged from the Navy in 1969.  The defendant says that
there was a real void between 1969 and 1995 (when
these proceedings were
commenced).  In 1970, the plaintiff saw a general practitioner and was referred
to a psychiatrist.  These
attendances concerned, inter alia, facial pain and
domestic problems.  He saw a general practitioner on about three other
occasions
for medical problems.  The facial pain was never satisfactorily
diagnosed and eventually it went away. The plaintiff does not recall
the names
of any of the practitioners seen by him.  It seems probable that the records
relating to these visits will not be available
to the defendant.
<P>

12	Prior to his discharge, the plaintiff served in Vietnam on HMAS Hobart.  The
ship was involved in shore bombardment exercises
and was shelled whilst the
plaintiff was on it.  It is conceded that this service aggravated the
plaintiff's underlying condition.
<P>

13	There is no evidence led by the defendant to establish actual prejudice.  It
is not said that the defendant's documentation has
been lost or destroyed.  The
defendant does not have the advantage of material relating to treatment
received during the 1969-1995
period.  However, it is difficult to see this
material having more than minor significance.  Otherwise, there is the void
referred
to by the defendant.  The period is lengthy.  The running of the
defendant's case at trial will be made more difficult by the delay.
<P>

14	To the extent that it is applicable to this case, I bear in mind what was
said in <u>Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2070%20ALJR%20866" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 70 ALJR
866.</a>  There is prejudice that will be suffered if the order sought is granted.
It is relevant to the question of damages.  If an order
is made, the defendant
loses the benefit of the statutory defence.  I take these matters into account
with the other relevant circumstances
in reaching my decision on this
application.
<P>

15	The plaintiff claims to have a cause of action to which <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 60G</a> applies.
It is not said that there is a lack of credible evidence to support the
contention that he suffers from Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder.  In the opinion
of Dr Holwill, the plaintiff "presents with a now chronic moderately severe"
disorder "with associated
moderately severe depression".  It is not said that
he does not have an arguable cause of action.  It may be productive of
substantial
damages.
<P>

16	The onus rests with the plaintiff to satisfy the Court that he has an
entitlement to relief.  In the relevant circumstances of
this case, I am
satisfied that the onus has been discharged.
<P>

17	I have reached the decision that it is just and reasonable to make the order
sought and that such an order should be made in
this case.
<P>

18	I extend the limitation period for the cause of action pleaded in the
Statement of Claim up to and including 29 November 1995.
 I reserve the
question of costs.  The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
