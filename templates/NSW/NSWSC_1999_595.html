<P>

<b>5137/98	STURDY COMPONENTS PTY LIMITED   -v-   BUROSITZMOBELFABRIK FREIDRICH
W DAUPHIN GMBH &amp; CO</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>   By summons filed on 24 December 1998 the
plaintiff, Sturdy Components Pty Ltd, claims an order that the creditor's
statutory demand
issued by the defendant, Burositzmobelfabrik Freidrich W
Dauphin GMBH &amp; Co to the plaintiff, dated 9 November 1998, and served
on 9
December 1998, be set aside pursuant to section 459G of the <i>Corporations
Law</i>.  Paragraph 1 of that demand is in the following terms:
<P>

The company owes Burositzmobelfabrik Freidrich W Dauphin GMBH &amp; Co of
Pegnitzstrasse 32, D-91217, Hersbrak, Germany
<P>

(a)	the amount of $525,053.41 (which, at an exchange rate selling of $A1 to
DM1.0338 as at 9 November 1998, is equivalent to DM542,800.22),
being the
amount of the debt described in the schedule.
<P>

2   	The schedule contains under the heading "Description of
Debt" the following:
<P>

Amount owing to the creditor by the company for goods sold and delivered by the
creditor to the company during the period 25 September
1997 to 20 May 1998, but
not including the amounts alleged by the creditor to be due and payable to the
company for interest, as
follows:
<P>

3   	There are then set forth a series of references to invoice
numbers, date due since, amount due, the latter column being in
Deutschmarks.
Under the heading "Amount of Debt", the schedule discloses a total
DM542,800.22, being $A525,053.41 at an exchange
rate of $A1 to DM1.0338.
<P>

4   	The plaintiff submits that the demand should be set aside
on a number of grounds.  Those grounds include the submission that
the
plaintiff's claim is not a debt due and payable within the meaning of section
459E of the <i>Corporations Law, </i>because, so it is submitted, it is a claim
in a foreign currency; that the alleged debt is governed by a joint venture
agreement,
to which I shall, in due course, make further reference, and under
the terms of that agreement the alleged debt is not due and payable;
and that
the plaintiff has an offsetting claim under the terms of the joint venture
agreement, which is equal to or greater than
the amount of the claim.
<P>

5   	For each of the foregoing reasons it is submitted by the
plaintiff that there is a genuine dispute between the plaintiff and
the
defendant about the existence of the debt to which the claim relates.  If the
Court is satisfied that there is such a genuine
dispute, then, pursuant to the
provisions of section 459H the Court must set aside the claim.
<P>

6   	The defendant is a German company which is a maker of
office chairs.  The plaintiff has been invoiced concerning the sale by
the
defendant to the plaintiff of a quantity of office chairs.  As I understand it,
there is no dispute by the plaintiff that it
has received the goods the subject
of the various invoices referred to in the schedule to the statutory demand.
Further, as I understand
it, there is no dispute by the plaintiff that the
amounts set forth in those invoices accurately reflect the purchase prices of
the
various items.
<P>

7   	There has been placed in evidence a considerable quantity
of material concerning a joint venture which was entered into by
the defendant
and other companies associated with it and with certain companies compendiously
referred to as the "Sturdy" Group.
 It would appear that the companies referred
to by that latter designation are associated with the plaintiff.  Nevertheless,
in the
contractual documents which, over the objection of the defendant, were
admitted into evidence, the plaintiff is not a member of the
Sturdy Group and
is not a party to any of the various contractual arrangements disclosed by
those documents or relevant to the joint
venture.
<P>

8   	It has, in effect, been submitted on behalf of the
plaintiff that, although it is not a party to the formal written agreements
that have been entered into between the plaintiff and other companies (being
the companies described as the Sturdy Group), and although
the plaintiff is not
a party to the manufacturing licence agreement between the defendant and Sturdy
Holdings Pty Ltd, nevertheless,
so it is submitted, the contractual arrangement
between the plaintiff and the defendant should be governed by the agreement
between
the defendant and those other parties.
<P>

9   	I can see no basis for such a conclusion.  If the plaintiff
wished to have a contractual arrangement with the defendant, then
it was
entirely open to it to have entered into such an arrangement.  The fact that
companies under the same general control as the
plaintiff entered into a
binding contractual arrangement with the defendant does not seem to me to be
any ground upon which it can
properly be concluded that the plaintiff was bound
by a similar contractual arrangement. Presumably, for reasons best known to
itself,
the plaintiff and those controlling it, chose not to enter into such a
contractual arrangement with the defendant.
<P>

10   	Accordingly, the ground upon which the plaintiff now
relies, that the debt claimed in the statutory demand is governed by
a joint
venture agreement between the defendant and entities other than the plaintiff,
with the consequence that, so it is submitted,
under the joint venture
agreement the debt is not presently due and payable, is not a ground which I
consider constitutes a basis
of a genuine dispute between the plaintiff and the
defendant concerning the amount of or the existence of the debt.
<P>

11   	The view which I have just expressed is also sufficient to
dispose of the submission on the part of the plaintiff that it
has an
offsetting claim against the defendant under the terms of the joint venture
agreement, which is equal to or greater than the
amount of the claim.  The
joint venture agreement gives no rights to the plaintiff.  Any claim which
might be made against the defendant
or against anyone else under the joint
venture agreement is not a claim to which the plaintiff is entitled.
<P>

12   	There remains, however, to be considered the third of the
grounds upon which the plaintiff submits that there is a genuine
dispute as to
the indebtedness of the plaintiff to the defendant, and that is that the
plaintiff's claim is a claim in foreign currency.
 I have had the benefit of
being taken by Counsel to a number of decided cases that are relevant to a
consideration of this question,
and also to submissions in written form by
Counsel for the plaintiff.
<P>

13   	It is clear from the actual invoices which were submitted
by the defendant to the plaintiff that the claim of the plaintiff
was in German
currency, in Deutschmarks, and not in Australian currency, Australian dollars.
The parties appear to have acted upon
the basis of what are described as the
terms of sale, delivery and payment of the defendant in relation to the goods
which were sold
by the defendant to the plaintiff. But whether or not they did
so, there appears to be no doubt that the payment which the parties
contemplated should be made for goods sold by the defendant to the plaintiff
should be calculated in Deutschmarks.  That fact appears
to be conceded by the
plaintiff.
<P>

14   	The plaintiff, however, submits that the form of the
statutory demand is such that it does not comply with the requirements
of
section 459E, in particular with subsection (2) of that section.  The effect of
requirement (e) of that subsection that the demand
must be in the prescribed
form is that it must comply with the form set forth as Form 509H in Schedule 2
to the <i>Corporations Law</i>.  That form contemplates that the amount in
Australian dollars must appear in paragraph 1 of the form.
<P>

15   	It is of interest to note that, apparently, the
predecessor to the <i>Corporations Law</i>, being the Companies Code, did not
provide, either expressly or by necessary implication, that the amount of the
debt specified in
the demand was required to be stated in Australian currency.
In that regard see <i>International Factors (Singapore) Pty Ltd v Speedy Tyres
Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%205%20ACSR%20250" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 5 ACSR 250</a> and <i>Re Ikin </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%204%20SCR%20582" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 4 SCR 582.</a>  
<P>

16   	Those two cases were considered by Justice Finkelstein in
the Federal Court of Australia in <i>Vehicle Wash Systems Pty Ltd v Mark VII
Equipment Incorporated </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%2025%20ACSR%20709" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 25 ACSR 709.</a>  His Honour in that case
referred to the judgment of Dixon J (as he then was) in the High Court of
Australia in <i>Jolley v Mainka </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1933/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1933] HCA 43</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1933%5d%2049%20CLR%20242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1933] 49 CLR 242</a> at 254f.
<P>

17   	It has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that an
obligation to pay in foreign currency does not create a debt, despite
the fact
that, as appears to be conceded by the plaintiff, the requirements of the
various invoices and of whatever might have been
the contractual relationship
between the plaintiff and the defendant required any amount payable by the
plaintiff to be paid in German
currency.
<P>

18   	It has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that in
such circumstances there is no debt which is susceptible of being
the subject
of a statutory demand, but that a party in the position of the defendant should
sue in damages and, having obtained a
judgment, could then rely upon that
judgment (which, presumably, would be in Australian dollars), to be the subject
of a statutory
demand.  
<P>

19   	It is clear from a careful reading of the judgment of
Dixon J in <i>Jolley v Mainka </i>that his Honour drew a distinction between a
payment in foreign specie and a payment of an amount which was calculated in
accordance
with a foreign currency.
<P>

20   	Finkelstein J in <i>Vehicle Wash </i>also referred to what
might be described as "modern commercial transactions of an international
nature", and said at 716:
<P>

In some circumstances a statutory demand will be set aside if it does not
contain sufficient information to permit a calculation
of the amount due.
<i>Delta Beta Pty Ltd v Vissers</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%2020%20ACSR%20583" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 20 ACSR 583</a> is an example of such a
case.  There the defect in the demand was that it did not identify the
individual components of an alleged
debt and the applicant was not able to
verify the amount claimed to be due and owing from its own records. Here
however the assertion
by Vehicle Wash that it will be caused an injustice
proceeds on a false premise namely that it is required to convert the US dollar
amount into Australian currency in order to discharge its obligation (if any)
to Mark VII. The premise is false because no such conversion
is required. The
facts that are before the Court show that if Vehicle Wash does owe Mark VII the
amount in question that amount is
to be paid in US dollars. No question of
conversion arises and no injustice will result from stating the debt in US
dollars.
<P>

21   	It seems to me that the views therein expressed by
Finkelstein J have relevance and application to the circumstances of the
instant case.  The parties here contemplated that the plaintiff would pay the
defendant in German Deutschmarks.  The amount of those
German Deutschmarks is
expressly set forth in the statutory demand.  The conversion into Australian
dollars is set forth only in
order to comply with a requirement which did not
exist under the previous legislation and has only existed since the
<i>Corporations Law </i>came into effect, that is, that there should be a
reference to an amount in Australian currency in the demand itself.
<P>

22   	It does not seem to me that there can be any confusion in
the mind of the plaintiff as to how much it is being required to
pay.  In
regard to this question of payment in foreign currency, I have been taken to a
recent decision of Davies J in the Federal
Court of Australia in <i>Conley v
Deputy Commissioner of Taxation </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20152%20ALR%20467" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 152 ALR 467.</a>  In that case his
Honour referred to what are described in Dr F A Mann's "The Legal Aspect Of
Money", 4 ed, p 63 as "monetary obligations".
 The learned author there
states:
<P>

Monetary obligations primarily exist where the debtor is bound to pay a fixed,
certain, specific, or liquidated sum of money.
<P>

23   	At p 190 the author states, when speaking of foreign
currency:
<P>

Where the payment of a sum of foreign money is promised, a monetary obligation
exists, because the foreign money functions as money,
the legal character of
the obligation being inherently identical with that of an obligation to pay a
sum of domestic money.
<P>

24   	His Honour, having quoted the foregoing passages,
continued, at 470:
<P>

This principle has had application in Australia at least since the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca120/" class="autolink_findacts">Currency Act</a>
(Cth), <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca120/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 9</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca120/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">11</a> of which authorised transactions to be entered into
"<i>according to the currency of some country other than Australia</i>" and
payment to be made in that currency.
<P>

25   	His Honour continued by saying:
<P>

In chapter VII of his work, Dr Mann discusses the difference between foreign
money as money and foreign money as commodity. At pp
189-90 and the learned
author concludes:  
<P>

"The only conclusion which can be drawn with safety is that the working
principle stated above must be adhered to:  foreign money
is money where it
functions as such; it is a commodity where it is an object of commercial
inter-course.  In the vast majority of
circumstances, however, the former will
be the case and Brandon J (as he then was) cannot be criticized for stating
categorically:
(The Halcyon the Great  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%201%20WLR%20515" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 1 WLR 515</a> at 520) the term 'money'
includes 'money in foreign currency as well as in sterling'.  And where the
words 'money' on the one hand
and 'goods', 'commodity', 'merchandise' on the
other hand appear in a statute, it is a matter of interpretation whether
foreign money
is included in the former or the latter phrase."
<P>

26   	It is quite clear in the instant case that the parties
have proceeded on the basis, firstly, that payments by the plaintiff
should be
made to the defendant in German Deutschmarks, secondly, that the sum in German
Deutschmarks should be regarded as a debt
and not merely as a claim in
damages.
<P>

27   	Although the plaintiff has sought to rely upon a decision
of Senior Master Mahony in the Supreme Court of Victoria in <i>MEC Import Sales
Pty Ltd v Iozzelli SRL </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%2029%20ACSR%20229" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 29 ACSR 229</a> in support of its submission that
the form of the statutory demand is such as to cause the recipient of that
demand to be in a state
of uncertainty as to how much it is required to pay,
firstly, it seems to me, that the decision of Senior Master Mahony can be
distinguished
on its facts, since the demand in that case appeared to contain
within it no explanation as to the conversion which had been adopted
between
Italian currency and Australian currency. But, much more importantly, it seems
to me that the question should be approached
quite clearly in the context of
the relationship which existed between the parties.
<P>

28   	As I have already observed, there is no dispute between
the parties that the plaintiff was required to pay whatever was due
in German
Deutschmarks.  The amount in German Deutschmarks is clearly and expressly set
forth and the manner of the calculation of
that amount is set forth in the
statutory demand.
<P>

29   	The calculation in Australian currency has been included
only for the purpose of satisfying what appears to be a strict requirement,
albeit possibly an unintentional one, of the <i>Corporations Law</i>, resulting
from the precise wording of Form 459H.  It does not seem to me that this
question of the form of the statutory demand
requiring payment of an amount in
Australian currency, being the equivalent to a precisely calculated amount in
the currency in which
the parties contemplated any indebtedness should be paid,
has the result of constituting either a defect in the form of the demand
or a
basis upon which it can be said that there is a genuine dispute as to the
existence or the amount of the debt.
<P>

30   	In those circumstances, therefore, I am not satisfied that
any of the grounds upon which the plaintiff disputes its liability
to comply
with the demand constitutes a genuine dispute as to the existence or the amount
of the debt asserted in that demand.  It
follows therefore, that I propose to
dismiss the summons of the plaintiff.
<P>

31   	(Counsel addressed on costs.)
<P>

32   	I make the following orders:
<P>

(1)	I order that the summons be dismissed.
<P>

(2)	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the defendant.
<P>

	The exhibits may be returned together with the authorities provided.
