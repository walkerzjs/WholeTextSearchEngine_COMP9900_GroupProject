<center><u>11565/93  - THE COUNCIL OF THE SHIRE OF BALLINA  v  WILLIAM
RINGLAND</u></center>
<P>


<P>

<b>Reasons for judgment</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  In the early 1980's the sewerage system of the Shire of Ballina,
on the far north coast of New South Wales, was extended
to the town of Lennox
Head.  It included an ocean outfall at Skennar's Head, a little to the south of
the town.  The system was,
and remains, the responsibility of the plaintiff,
the Ballina Shire Council.  At the time it was introduced it provided for the
treatment
of sewage, which is mostly in liquid form, in three stages.  The
primary stage was a screening process by which larger solids were
removed and
disposed of.  The secondary stage was a sedimentation process whereby the
heavier material was separated and drawn off.
 The tertiary stage involved the
detention of the remaining liquid in a pond to break down bacteria and viruses.
The resulting effluent
was a clear liquid which was discharged into the ocean
through the outfall.  
<P>

2	The sewerage system at Lennox Head was put in place following a report of the
then shire engineer, Mr Peter Thorpe, prepared in
October 1981.  That report
was widely disseminated.  It was the subject of publicity in the local press
and a public meeting, also
in October 1981.  Copies were available at the
Council chambers and were supplied to various libraries, schools and clubs in
the
shire.  It will be necessary to refer later to part of that report.
<P>

<i>3	</i>By 1990 it was clear that, due to population growth, the shire's
sewerage system, including that at Lennox Head, needed to be upgraded.
Engineers were commissioned to examine how this might be done, and they
produced a report which recommended six options as the most
feasible.  Over the
next two years the Council engaged in wide community consultation about the
matter.  Brochures were sent to the
residents explaining the six options and
setting out the advantages and disadvantages (including the cost) of each of
them.  A number
of public meetings were held and the matter was aired in the
local press.
<P>

4	The Council favoured an augmentation of the sewerage system which retained
the outfall at Skennar's Head, but reused as much of
the effluent as  possible
for irrigation of the golf course and some playing fields in the Ballina area.
It was also proposed that
the treatment of the sewage be supplemented by
ultraviolet disinfection of the effluent.  A poll of the residents disclosed
that
the majority favoured the continued use of the outfall, with or without
the reuse of some of the effluent for irrigation.  In due
course an
environmental impact statement was prepared and made available to the public,
and submissions about the proposed development
were invited.
<P>

5	Among those who took a lively interest in these developments was the
defendant, Mr Bill Ringland.  He is an elderly man who, in
the early 1980's,
retired with his wife to a small property at Brooklet, about 15 kms from
Ballina.  He is a keen swimmer and, clearly,
has derived great enjoyment from
the beautiful coastline in the area.  In the late 1980's he joined the Ballina
Environment Society
Inc, a body with a small membership, and he later became
its president.  The issue of the sewerage augmentation led to the formation
of
an allied organisation called the Clean Seas Coalition, of which he was the
chairman, and which included amongst its members Mr
Ian Cohen MLC and a Byron
Bay resident, Mr John Whiting.  These groups made public their opposition to
the ocean outfall, advocating
methods of disposal which would reuse the whole
of the effluent.  Publicity included statements by the defendant and Mr
Cohen.
<P>

6	The Council adopted the procedure appropriate for a development application
and the Ballina Environment Society lodged an objection
to it.  In September
1992 the development was approved, subject to certain conditions.  The
Environment Society appealed against
this decision to the Land and Environment
Court.  The parties agreed to mediation, which led to a deed of agreement of 26
March 1993
enabling the development to proceed, subject to certain further
conditions.  Those additional conditions are not relevant for present
purposes.
What is significant is that the agreement accepted that the augmented sewerage
system would retain the ocean outfall. 
The deed was signed on behalf of the
Ballina Environment Society by the defendant as its president.  He was present
throughout the
mediation but, because he did not have the necessary expertise,
he was not part of the Society's negotiating team.
<P>

7	On 1 April 1993, the Clean Seas Coalition issued a press release.  That
document is the centrepiece of the plaintiff's case. 
It invited the reader to
contact the defendant, Mr Cohen or Mr Whiting for further information.  It
opened by applauding the Ballina
Environment Society for its pursuit of the
outfall issue in the Land and Environment Court "in the public interest".  It
described
the agreement reached as a result of the mediation as "a landmark for
public participation", but added that the Coalition considered
it to be "just
the beginning, not an end in itself".  It then attributed the following words
to the defendant:
<P>

	Whilst we are pleased with the gains made, all groups in our Coalition
recognise that the agreement did not go far enough.  The
output of the Lennox
Head outfall will be increased against the will of the ocean users.  This means
greater pollution.  Sewage is
and will continue to be pumped out
surreptitiously at night and during storms.  Our organisation never has had
(sic) and never will
accept the efficiency of ultraviolet treatment.  We are
heartened that the Ballina Council has agreed to consult with the community.
<P>

8	The document went on to record that the "first post-mediation meeting"
unanimously supported the eventual closure of the outfall.
 Criticism of the
adequacy of the system proposed by the Council was attributed to Mr Cohen, who
described the ultraviolet disinfection
as "substandard", and urged the pursuit
of other methods of disposal which would involve reuse of the effluent.  The
document asserted
the continuing opposition of the Coalition to the concept of
ocean outfalls, which it described as "obsolete and obscene".  It concluded
by
announcing that a meeting of the local community about the issue would be
called "due to ongoing public interest".
<P>

9	The plaintiff fastens upon the assertion in the passage attributed to the
defendant that "sewage is and will continue to be pumped
out surreptitiously at
night and during storms".  This is said to be false in two respects.  To
understand the plaintiff's case,
it is necessary to ascertain the precise
meaning of words commonly used in connection with the disposal of household and
industrial
waste.  The way in which these words are used by experts in the
field is consistent with the meanings attributed to them in the Shorter
Oxford
English Dictionary and the Macquarie Dictionary.
<P>

10	"Sewage" is defined in the Macquarie Dictionary as "the waste matter which
passes through sewers".  It was accepted by the parties
that it means the
refuse which emanates from domestic or commercial premises in its untreated
form.  "Sewer" means the conduit or
system of pipes for carrying off that
refuse.  "Sewerage" means the system of removal of waste matter through sewers.
"Effluent"
means the outflow produced through the treatment of sewage.
<P>

11	The plaintiff's claim is that the defendant in the press release asserted
falsely that the Council was involved in the discharge
of untreated refuse into
the ocean, and was doing so surreptitiously, that is, in such a way as to
conceal its activity from the
residents of the area.  These assertions, it is
said, are very injurious to the standing and reputation of the Council and have
caused
it financial loss.
<P>

12	The press release led to an article on 2 April in the local newspaper, The
Northern Star, under the heading "Sewage Will Still
Flow Into Sea, Group Says".
It included the relevant parts of the passage attributed to the defendant:  in
particular, the reference
to sewage being pumped out surreptitiously at night
and during storms, and the Coalition's refusal to accept the efficiency of
ultraviolet
treatment.  This led the shire president, Mr Keith Johnson, to call
a special meeting of the Council, which took place on 7 April.
 The expenses of
that meeting are essential to the plaintiff's claim, and I shall return to that
matter in due course.
<P>

13	At the meeting it was resolved that the defendant "and representatives of
the Clean Seas Coalition" be requested to issue a retraction
of the offending
part of the article and, should there be no satisfactory response, proceedings
be instituted for defamation.  It
was also resolved that Mr Johnson should
negotiate a suitable retraction from the newspaper itself.  On 13 April the
Council's solicitors
wrote to the defendant, requesting that he publish in the
newspaper an apology which was set out in the letter, but none was forthcoming.
However, on 10 April the newspaper itself published an apology, acknowledging
that the Council was not engaged in the covert discharge
of "raw sewage" into
the ocean and questioning the motives of the Clean Seas Coalition in making
such an allegation.  The article
added that "the press release can only be
assumed to be aimed at discrediting the council, without justification."
<P>

14	In May 1993 the Council issued a statement of claim against the defendant
seeking damages for defamation and, in the alternative,
injurious falsehood.
The defendant filed a cross-claim seeking damages for abuse of process.  At an
early stage of the proceedings,
Levine J submitted certain questions for the
determination of the Court of Appeal, which considered whether, in the
circumstances
of the case, any of the causes of action pleaded would lie:
<i>Ballina Shire Council v Ringland</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2033%20NSWLR%20680" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 33 NSWLR 680.</a>  The Court was
comprised of Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Mahoney JA.  By majority (Gleeson CJ and
Kirby P), it was held that defamation
did not lie, as a popularly elected local
government authority could not sue in defamation in respect of material
reflecting upon
the performance of its functions.  However, it was held that
the other causes of action could be pursued: as to injurious falsehood,
again
by majority (Gleeson CJ and Mahoney JA), and as to abuse of process, by the
whole Court.
<P>

15	Perceiving that any damages which the Council might recover would be very
modest, Gleeson CJ expressed the hope that "serious
consideration will be given
to the utility of these proceedings"(at 694).  Apparently, any such
consideration did not dissuade the
Council from pressing on.  Hence the
proceedings before me. The Council sues Mr Ringland for injurious falsehood,
seeking as special
damage the expenses of the meeting to which I have referred,
together with exemplary damages. (A claim for aggravated damages was
not
pursued at the hearing.)  Mr Ringland resists the Council's claim and
cross-claims for abuse of process, seeking compensatory
and punitive
damages.
<P>

16	It seems that the press release was drafted by Mr Cohen, but the three men
had discussed it and the defendant approved of its
terms. The source of the
assertion that sewage was being pumped out at the ocean outfall surreptitiously
at night and during storms
was a passage from the 1981 report of the shire
engineer, Mr Peter Thorpe, to which I have referred earlier.  At page six of
that
report, having described the process of treatment of the sewage, the
author continued:
<P>

	The effluent is pumped from the aeration lagoon to the proposed ocean outfall
to discharge below low-water mark into deep water.
The pumps and pipeline from
the aeration lagoon to the ocean have been sized to pump the daily discharge
during the hours of darkness
or storm conditions. This consideration has been
made to avoid evidence of local discolouration occurring when fresh water joins
saltwater and to eliminate the possibility of contact of swimmers with the
treated effluent. 
<P>

17	It is the defendant's case that the passage in the press release upon which
the Council relies is not false or, at least, was
believed by him to be true.
In evidence, he said that he understood the word "sewage" to mean material
emanating from "sewerage pipes",
so as to embrace effluent. To him, he said,
the word "surreptitiously" meant "doing something Council didn't want observed"
because
it was "embarrassed by it".  He saw "secret" as a stronger word than
"surreptitious".  It was his case that the process of discharge
of effluent
through the outfall "during the hours of darkness or storm conditions", as
described in Mr Thorpe's report, could properly
be labelled surreptitious, as
he understood the term. 
<P>

	<b>Injurious falsehood</b>
<P>

18	When this matter was before it, the Court of Appeal considered the nature of
the tort of injurious falsehood:  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2033%20NSWLR%20680" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 33 NSWLR 680</a> per Gleeson CJ at 692-4,
Kirby P (as his Honour then was) at 711-12 and Mahoney JA at 733. Gleeson CJ
described it in this way (at
692): 
<P>

	An action for damages for injurious falsehood, which is in some respects like,
and in other respects unlike, an action for defamation,
will lie in certain
circumstances where one person maliciously publishes a false statement about or
affecting another, and where
actual damage has resulted. 
<P>

19	The Chief Justice referred to the discussion of the tort in Fleming, <i>The
Law of Torts</i> (8th edition) and<i> Gatley on Libel and Slander</i> (8th
edition): see now the 9th edition of <i>Gatley</i>, chapter 20. 
<P>

20	Kirby P defined it thus (at 711):
<P>

	The tort of injurious falsehood consists of the publication of false
statements concerning a plaintiff or his property, calculated
to induce others
not to deal with him causing financial harm: see J G Fleming, <i>The Law of
Torts</i>, 8th ed (1992) at 711. The tort resembles defamation. Falsity is not
presumed but must be affirmatively established by the plaintiff.
So must
financial harm.
<P>

21	The damage claimed normally arises from the disparagement of the plaintiff's
property or business, although it may be that the
action has a wider scope:
Gleeson CJ at 693, <i>Gatley</i> (9th ed), paragraph 20.4.  I shall return to
the question of damage, as it appears to me to be determinative of the
Council's claim
in this case. 
<P>

22	In deciding whether the statement complained of is false, regard must be had
to the ordinary meaning of the words used. As in
defamation, the question is
what would those words convey to the ordinary reader: <i>Gatley</i>, paragraph
20.5.  Of course, particular words must not be divorced from their context. 
<P>

23	Here, if the words "sewage" and "surreptitiously" in the press release are
afforded their dictionary meanings, the impugned statement
is undoubtedly
false.  Counsel for the defendant did not submit to the contrary.  It is not
suggested that the Council ever discharged
untreated waste from the ocean
outfall, or had any intention of doing so.  The word "surreptitious" is defined
in the Macquarie dictionary
to mean "obtained, done, made, etc, by stealth;
secret and unauthorised; clandestine".  It is not suggested that the discharge
of
effluent from the outfall in the manner described in the Thorpe report could
fairly be characterised in that way. 
<P>

24	However, it was submitted on behalf of the defendant that falsity was not
established when the sentence was read in the context
of the press release as a
whole.  Immediately after that sentence the document continues: "Our
organisation never has had and never
will accept the efficiency of ultra violet
treatment."  What follows amounts to a criticism of the system of treatment of
the sewage,
as it existed and as it was proposed, rather than an assertion that
untreated waste was being discharged into the ocean.  
<P>

25	There is some force in the argument that, in those circumstances, a reader
would not have taken the word "sewage" to mean untreated
waste.  Clearly, the
word is frequently used imprecisely in everyday parlance.  Often one hears the
expression "raw sewage" but,
by its dictionary definition, all sewage is
necessarily "raw".  The adjective is mere surplusage.  More significantly, the
expression
"raw sewage" is to be found in some of the Council's own documents,
including a pamphlet about the proposed sewerage augmentation
circulated to
householders in 1991 (Exhibit E).  Indeed, Mr Thorpe's report, having correctly
defined "sewage" on page three, refers
to "raw sewage" on page five.  If the
defendant understood the word "sewage" to encompass treated waste, it is
obvious that he was
not alone in that belief. 
<P>

26	Similarly, it was submitted that a reader would not have been misled by the
use of the word "surreptitiously".  At most, it was
said, this was an
exaggerated description of the manner in which effluent was discharged from the
outfall and the rationale behind
it.  The Thorpe report stated that the purpose
of discharge during the hours of darkness or during storms was to eliminate
contact
with swimmers.  In evidence, the shire president, Mr Johnson, said that
he understood that this course was adopted also to anticipate
community concern
about discolouration of the water which might result from the discharge. 
<P>

27	That said, the Council has presented an arguable case that the impugned
sentence in the press release is false.  It faces a more
formidable task,
however, in establishing malice on the part of the defendant. That element is
succinctly expressed in <i>Gatley</i> (supra), chapter 20.7: "...the defendant
will be guilty of malice if (a) he knows that the statement is untrue or is
reckless as
to its truth or (b) he is actuated by some improper motive. The
first will be virtually conclusive as to malice."  To the same effect,
albeit
in a somewhat different context, is the explanation of the term by Lord Diplock
in <i>Horrocks v Lowe</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20AC%20135" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] AC 135</a> at 149-51. 
<P>

28	The Council's primary submission was that the defendant knew the statement
to be untrue or, at least, was reckless as to its
truth.  A vigorous attack on
his credibility was mounted in cross-examination, directed particularly to his
evidence of his understanding
of the words "sewage" and "surreptitiously".  As
to "sewage", he was taken to documents of the Ballina Environment Society, and
to
a letter which he himself had written to the local newspaper, in which
treated waste was correctly described as "effluent".  
<P>

29	The Council also relied, circumstantially, on other evidence said to be
inconsistent with the defendant's belief in the truth
of what was asserted and,
in any event, demonstrative of his being actuated by an improper motive. The
press release was said to
be at odds with the agreement which had been reached
between the Council and the Ballina Environment Society, following the
mediation
in the Land and Environment Court.  It was suggested that it was the
defendant's realisation of this which led to the issue of the
press release
under the banner of the Clean Seas Coalition.  According to the defendant, he
was aware of the Thorpe report well before
the mediation.  That being so, it
was asked, why had he not raised this issue before the agreement was
reached?
<P>

30	Although Mr Cohen was the draughtsman of the press release after discussion
of its terms, he was not called as a witness by the
defendant.  For the Council
it was submitted that I should draw an inference in accordance with <i>Jones v
Dunkel</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1959/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1959] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%20101%20CLR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959) 101 CLR 298.</a>
<P>

31	On the question of malice I consider that the Council's case is far from
compelling.  The defendant did not always fare well
in cross-examination, and
at times was defensive to the point of obstruction.  Nevertheless, my
impression was of a man whose demeanour
was influenced by a firm, perhaps
stubborn, belief in his cause, rather than someone who was being deliberately
untruthful. 
<P>

32	His evidence of his understanding of the scope of the word "sewage" is
plausible enough, for the reasons I have outlined above.
 I am more sceptical
about his evidence of the use of the word "surreptitious".  The dictionary
definition of that word is widely
understood in the community and, as it was
used in the press release, there is no denying its pejorative flavour.
Nevertheless, I
incline to the view that it was intended as something of a
dramatic flourish for the purpose of vigorous political discourse and
that, in
the circumstances, its use falls short of demonstrating  malice.  Nor would I
readily infer malice from the fact that the
press release was issued shortly
after the mediation agreement.  If I had to determine the matter, I would not
find that element
proved.
<P>

33	At the end of the day, however, I find it unnecessary to express any firm
conclusion on the questions of falsity and malice.
 The Council must also
establish actual damage, and I have concluded that on this element its claim
founders as a matter of law.
 This is because the wrong which the action is
designed to remedy is the interference in relations, whether commercial or
otherwise,
between the plaintiff and persons other than the defendant. I have
referred earlier to the statement of Kirby P, derived from Fleming,
that the
tort "consists of the publication of false statements concerning a plaintiff or
his property, calculated to induce others
not to deal with him...".
<i>McGregor on Damages</i> (16th ed) states at paragraph 1942: 
<P>

	The tort of injurious falsehood, developing through slander of title and
slander of goods, makes actionable any false statement
made maliciously about
the plaintiff to third parties with the result that they act so as to cause
damage to the plaintiff.
<P>

34	<i>Gatley</i>, at paragraph 20.4 (referred to above), states that the
"falsehood must be communicated to third persons since the tort consists
of
interference with the plaintiff's relations with those persons". 
<P>

35	The cases to which I have been referred bear these statements out, as each
of them involved a claim of that kind. Two cases referred
to by Gleeson CJ (at
692-3) provide examples.  In <i>Barrett v Associated Newspapers Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281907%29%2023%20TLR%20666" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1907)
23 TLR 666</a>, the plaintiff's claim was founded upon an article alleging that a
house which he let to tenants was haunted.  Publication of the
article, as
Gleeson CJ put it, "was unlikely to assist his earnings as a landlord".  In
<i>Ratcliffe v Evans</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1892%5d%202%20QB%20524" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1892] 2 QB 524</a>, the plaintiff alleged a loss of
business as an engineer and boilermaker following a publication to the effect
that he had ceased
trading.  I was referred in argument to <i>Joyce v
Sengupta</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1992/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] EWCA Civ 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%201%20WLR%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 1 WLR 337</a>, in which the plaintiff alleged that her
employment prospects had been damaged by a publication adverse to her
reputation as a maidservant:
see the judgment of Sir Donald Nicholls V-C at 341
and 346.  See also <i>Procor Ltd  v United Steelworkers of America</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2065%20DLR%20%284th%29%20287" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989)
65 DLR (4th) 287</a>, where the plaintiff company alleged that false statements had
led to action being taken against it by Canada Customs.    
<P>

36	No such claim is made by the Council in this case.  As I have said, the only
actual damage claimed is the expenses of the special
Council meeting of 7 April
1993.  It is not suggested that that meeting was called as a result of public
outcry following the article
in the local newspaper. Nor is it suggested that
the publication affected in any way the Council's dealings with any corporation
or person other than the defendant himself. 
<P>

37	This issue was raised, but not decided, in the Court of Appeal. Gleeson CJ
(at 694) and Mahoney JA (at 733) left the question
open, considering that it
should be decided in the light of the evidence at the trial. Kirby P found it
unnecessary to decide the
matter as he was of the view that the action was not
available to the Council in any event.  However, after referring to the costs
of the special meeting, his Honour did say this much (at 712): 
<P>

	I am extremely doubtful that such costs, which were incurred after the wrong
alleged and in the course of the ordinary activities
of the Council as a local
authority, constitute "special damages" within the requirements of the tort.

<P>

38	I respectfully share his Honour's doubts.  Indeed, I am satisfied that the
expenses of the meeting do not amount to actual damage
of the kind which might
give rise to an action for injurious falsehood.  Accordingly, the Council's
claim fails.
<P>

	<b>Abuse of process </b>
<P>

39	The defendant's cross-claim for abuse of process was directed at the
proceedings as the Council had instituted them, including
the claim for
defamation which the Court of Appeal held was not available to it.  The
cross-claim alleges that the proceedings are
an abuse because they were
"instituted and continued for the real and improper purpose of interfering,
embarrassing, hindering and
blackmailing" the defendant in the carrying out of
his duties as the president of the Cleans Seas Coalition: in particular, his
investigation
of the Council's activities in relation to the outfall, his
appraisal and (where necessary) criticism of those activities, and his
exercise
of "his right and privilege of freedom of speech".   The statement of claim is
said to have been issued for those purposes,
and not for the purpose of
vindicating the Council's reputation or obtaining damages.
<P>

40	Put shortly, the cross-claim alleges that the Council's real purpose in
bringing the proceedings was to silence the defendant.
 His evidence was that
that had been their effect. That it was their purpose is said to be inferred
from evidence given by Mr Johnson
in cross-examination, together with the
circumstances of the institution and continuation of the proceedings. 
<P>

41	It may well be that for some time the Council had perceived the defendant
(and other members of the Clean Seas Coalition) as
a thorn in its side.  In an
article in the local newspaper of September 1992 Mr Johnson was quoted as
describing the Coalition as
a "small, but vocal anti-outfall group", which had
expressed "a continual, obsessive and illogical opposition to Ballina's plans
to upgrade effluent quality".  He went on: 
<P>

	Despite their claims to have solutions to effluent disposal, they have yet to
put forward one practical, affordable solution. 
Instead, they have simply
repeated slogans, abused the Council, and dreamed up bogey-man horror stories.

<P>

42	In evidence, Mr Johnson conceded that by those comments he had "over reacted
a little" to public statements attributed to the
defendant at that time.
However, he denied any ill-feeling towards the defendant, saying that a strong
response was called for in
the circumstances.
<P>

43	Mr Johnson said that he called the special meeting of Council after the
newspaper article on 2 April 1993 because he wanted to
determine "a course of
action that could get the public record straight".  He saw the article as
having the potential to frustrate
the Council's work in informing the public
about the proposed sewerage augmentation, in which "a huge amount of time,
effort and
money" had been invested.  It was for the same reason that the
statement of claim was issued.  Although the newspaper had published
an apology
and a retraction, he sought a "withdrawal by the people who made the
assertion".  He added, "We wanted the Clean Seas
Coalition and Mr Ringland to
do a reversal of their statement and point out the statements they made were in
fact incorrect". 
<P>

44	The proceedings were instituted, he said, "to vindicate the Council's
standing in the public eye".  They were not brought to
make the defendant pay
damages or costs.  He denied that their purpose was to silence the defendant.
He said: 
<P>

	We didn't want silence, we in fact wanted a retraction.
<P>

	<b>... ...</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>What we were trying to do was to get him to stick to fair and
reasonable comments and we were trying to get him to realise that there
was a
point beyond which one, if you like, ought not to go in terms of the public
debate and that point being to make statements
which were clearly false and
which we believed Mr Ringland knew to be false. 
<P>

45	Asked if he had instructed the Council's solicitors to proceed with the
injurious falsehood claim after the Court of Appeal decision,
he said, "No, we
let that stand. We didn't instruct or de-instruct ...."  He added, however,
that the solicitors were to attempt
to negotiate "a reasonable settlement" with
the defendant, whereby the outstanding claim and cross-claim would be dropped
"without
either party accepting liability."  Obviously, any such negotiation
was unsuccessful.
<P>

46	To establish the tort of abuse of process, the defendant must prove that the
Council instituted these proceedings for a purpose
or to effect an object
beyond that which the legal process offers: <i>Williams v Spautz </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20174%20CLR%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 174
CLR 509</a> in the joint judgment at 523.  The nature of the tort was examined in
the judgments in that case, as it had been by the Court of
Appeal in
<i>Hanrahan v Ainsworth </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2022%20NSWLR%2073" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 22 NSWLR 73:</a> see the judgments of Kirby P at
93-7, Mahoney JA at 98-9 and Clarke JA at 107-23.  The Court of Appeal in the
present case foreshadowed
that the elements of the tort may need to be examined
with some refinement, in the light of a matter considered in the judgments
in
both those cases: see Gleeson CJ at 695-6, Kirby P at 712-3 and Mahoney JA at
733-4.  However, as the evidence has unfolded, I
do not consider it necessary
to do so.
<P>

47	It is well established that a party alleging that proceedings are an abuse
of process bears a heavy onus: <i>Williams v Spautz</i> in the joint judgment
at 529; <i>Hanrahan v Ainsworth</i>, per Kirby P at 95. Here, the defendant
sets out to prove no less than that the Council instituted these proceedings,
and continued
them, for the predominant purpose of silencing him as a public
critic of the sewerage proposal.  That is denied by Mr Johnson, whom
I found to
be an honest witness.  It is not inconsistent with that position that Mr
Johnson's interest in the proceedings was the
vindication of the Council's
position and a retraction by the defendant of the statements complained of,
rather than the recovery
of damages. Protection of the plaintiff's reputation
is a legitimate aim of an action not only in defamation but also in injurious
falsehood: <i>Joyce v Sengupta</i> (supra) at 343.  Of course, the fact that
the defendant abandoned the public arena after being served with the statement
of claim,
while relevant, is by no means determinative. 
<P>

48	Mr Johnson's responses in cross-examination and the circumstances of the
Council's institution and prosecution of the proceedings,
even viewed in
combination, do not fairly give rise to the inference of improper purpose for
which the defendant contends.  Reasonable
minds might differ as to whether the
proceedings were an appropriate response to the publication for which the
defendant was responsible,
particularly after the decision of the Court of
Appeal.  However, they have not been shown to be an abuse of process. 
<P>

49	As it happens, the issue of special damage arose also in relation to the
cross-claim.  I heard argument about whether special
damage need be proved and,
if so, whether it had been in this case. In the light of my finding on the main
issue, that is a question
which I need not resolve.
<P>

50	Accordingly, the defendant's cross-claim also fails. Before pronouncing
formal orders, I shall hear the parties on costs.
