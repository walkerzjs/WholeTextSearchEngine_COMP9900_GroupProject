<P>

<b>Tuesday, 7 September 1999.</b>
<P>

<b>File No. 2391/99 THOMAS HUGHES HOMES PTY LIMITED v THOMAS JOHN
NEWLAND</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  In this matter on 19 May 1999 His Honour Mr
Justice Santow ordered that by way of interim order the operation of Caveat No
5240488W
be extended until further order of the Court.  The order was made on
the ex parte application of the plaintiff and the matter was
brought back
before me today when an application was made on behalf of the defendant that
the order be vacated or, alternatively,
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ia191/s74.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74</a> MA that the plaintiff
withdraw the caveat.  No motion was filed by the defendant but the parties are
happy that the matter be determined
on the basis of the defendant's oral
application.
<P>

2  	In the event that the defendant is not successful it is agreed
that it will be necessary for the plaintiff to amend the Summons
to include a
claim for substantive relief in the proceedings.
<P>

3  	The plaintiff is a builder and the defendant is the proprietor of
land over the which the caveat has been lodged claiming an
estate or interest
under an equitable charge pursuant to cl 20 in a building agreement dated 24
March 1998 made between the plaintiff
and the defendant.
<P>

4  	Clause 20 was in the following terms:-
<P>

"If there is an amount outstanding including any legal fees and costs
associated with recovering an amount under this Agreement
the Owner agrees that
the Land on which the Building Works are being undertaken is hereby charged in
favour of the Contractor for
such outstanding amount.  This clause shall not
merge on completion."
<P>

5  	It has been recognised for many years that such a clause gives a
caveatable interest.  See for instance <b>Griffiths v Hodge </b>2 BPR 97134.
<P>

6  	The defendant's contention is that there is no arguable claim
that the plaintiff has a caveatable interest having regard to
the provisions of
s 7D of the <b>Home Building Act </b>1997.  That section, as it was in force at
the time of the contract entered into between the parties, was in the following
terms.

<P>

"<b>7D Extent of caveatable interest in land under contract.</b>
<P>

The holder of a licence who is a party to a contract and in whose favour a
judgment or order of a court or tribunal has been made
against another party to
the contract has a caveatable interest for the purposes of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property
Act 1900</a> in the land on which the contract work is, or is to be, carried out if
the land is subject to that Act."
<P>

7  	The factual situation in the present matter is that there has
been a falling out between the parties and the plaintiff, builder,
claims a sum
is due, pursuant to the contract for certain works.  The other fact which is to
be noted is that the builder has obtained
no order or judgment against the
owner and, indeed, has recently commenced proceedings in the District Court
seeking to recover $76,250
which is the sum which it alleges is due under the
contract.
<P>

8  	In short the argument of the defendants is that s 7D requires
that any caveatable interest whether pursuant to a provision in
a contract or
otherwise requires that there be a judgment or order of the court.  In support
of his argument the defendant refers
in particular to the opening words of s 7D
and also to the comments made in the second reading speech on the passage of
the Bill
through Parliament in 1996.
<P>

9  	Reading s 7D above and without having regard to the object of the
Act as a whole one might be forgiven for thinking that the
section gave an
additional right to a builder to lodge a caveat where his agreement was silent
on the subject if he obtained a judgment
against the owner.  Section 7D is not
couched in negative terms of prohibition but in positive terms of a grant of
rights.
<P>

10  	In order to highlight the difficulty of construction one need
only to see the form of the present section 7D.  This followed
the passage of
the <b>Home Building Amendment Act </b>1998 as a result of which the new
section 7D is in the following terms:-
<P>

"<b>7D Interests in land under contract</b>
<P>

(1) A contract does not give the holder of a licence or any other person a
legal or equitable estate or interest in any land, and
a provision in a
contract or other agreement is void to the extent that it purports to create
such an estate or interest.
<P>

(2) Accordingly, the holder of a licence or any other person may not lodge a
caveat under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act 1900</a> in respect of an estate or interest
prohibited by subsection (1).
<P>

(3) However, subsection (1) does not apply to a provision in a contract that
creates a charge over land if:
<P>

(a) the land the subject of the charge is land on which the contract work is,
or is to be, carried out, and
<P>

(b) the charge is in favour of the holder of a licence who is a party to the
contract, and
<P>

(c) the charge is created to secure the payment to the holder of the licence by
another party to the contract of money due under
the contract, but only if a
court or tribunal has made an order or judgment that such payment be made,
and
<P>

(d) in the case of a charge over land under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act 1900</a> the
party to the contract against whom the judgment or order is made is the
registered proprietor of the land.
<P>

(4) A charge referred to in subsection (3) over land under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property
Act 1900</a> ceases to operate if the party to the contract against whom the
judgment or order is made ceases to be the registered proprietor
of the land so
charged."
<P>

11  	Under<b> </b>the transitional provisions<b> </b>that amendment
by<b> </b>way of repeal and re-enactment is said not to affect the validity
of
<P>

(a)	any caveat lodged in accordance with the Real Property Act1900, or
<P>

(b)any provision in a contract or agreement entered into, 
<P>

before the amendments commenced.
<P>

12  	Accordingly, the new section does not apply to the contract with
which I am concerned and thus the construction of the old
section 7D is
involved in the determination of the question before me.  On the second reading
speech on the amending Bill the doubts
that caused the amendment were expressed
in the following terms:-
<P>

"Unfortunately, doubts have arisen as to whether the provisions which were
introduced on 1 May 1997 are legally effective in preventing
contractors from
inserting caveat clauses in their contracts.  This bill will clarify the
operation of the Home Building Act in relation
to caveat clauses in home
building contracts and contracts for sale of kit homes.  The amendment to be
introduced by this bill provides
that a contractor will have an interest in
land which can be protected by a caveat only if, first, the contractor obtains
a judgment
against the home owner, second, the contract provides that
non-payment of a judgment gives this right, and, third, the judgment debtor
is
the owner of the land at the time the caveat is lodged."
<P>

13  	It is not appropriate to construe the first Act by reference to
the remedial legislation and the speeches associated with that
legislation.
However, one can have regard, pursuant to s 34 of the <b>Interpretation</b>
<b>Act </b>to what was said in the second reading speech of the original Bill.
The comments made on that reading were as follows: -
<P>

"A building contract will also no longer give a builder an estate or interest
in land in order to lodge a caveat on the title to
the consumer's land other
than in two special circumstances.  These are where the contract price is over
$500,000 and where a judgment
or order of a court or tribunal is made in favour
of the contractor.  Similar provisions apply to contracts to supply a kit
home."
<P>

14  	The reference to $500,000 was deleted from the bill before its
final passage.
<P>

15  	Under s 34 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation Act 1987</a> </b>this material
can be used to determine the meaning of the provision -
<P>

"(i) if the provision is ambiguous or obscure or
<P>

(ii)	if the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provisions (taking
into account its context in the Act or Statutory Rule
the purpose or object
underlying the Act or Statutory Rule and, in the case of a Statutory Rule the
purpose or object underlying
the Act which the Rule was made) leads to a result
that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonable."
<P>

16  	It is also important to bear in mind the provisions of s 33 of
the Act.  That section is in the following terms:-
<P>

<b>"33 Regard to be had to purposes or objects of Acts and statutory
rules</b>
<P>

In the interpretation of a provision of an Act or statutory rule, a
construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying
the Act or
statutory rule (whether or not that purpose or object is expressly stated in
the Act or statutory rule or, in the case
of a statutory rule, in the Act under
which the rule was made) shall be preferred to a construction that would not
promote that purpose
or object."
<P>

17  	This section reflects the contemporary approach to statutory
interpretation.  In <b>Sarasvati v The Queen </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%2d91%29%20172%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990-91) 172 CLR 1</a> at 21 Mr
Justice McHugh explained this process in these terms:-
<P>

"In many cases, the grammatical or literal meaning of a statutory provision
will give effect to the purpose of the legislation.
 Consequently, it will
constitute the `ordinary meaning' to be applied.  If however, the literal or
grammatical meaning of a provision
does not give effect to that purpose, that
meaning cannot be regarded as the `ordinary meaning' and cannot prevail.  It
must give
way to the construction which will promote the underlying purpose or
object of an Act."
<P>

18  	It is necessary to consider the circumstances in which the
section might operate.  There would appear to be at least three
circumstances
in which, in the context of a Building Agreement between a builder and a owner,
a caveatable interest might arise.
 These are:-
<P>

1.	That the contract contains an appropriate clause granting either a mortgage
or charge.
<P>

2.	The contract may in terms provide an entitlement to lodge a caveat.  Such a
clause does give a caveatable interest, see <b>Troncone v Aliperti </b>Court of
Appeal 20 April 1994.
<P>

3.	Particular circumstances of an agreement between parties for the joint
development of land, see <b>Davies v Uratoriu </b>Hodgson J 18 May 1995.
<P>

19  	This last example which I have quoted would seem to be an
extension of the principle referred to by Mahoney J in support of
his
conclusion in <b>Troncone v Aliperti.</b>  There he said:-
<P>

"It is a fundamental principle of construction that "Whoever grants a thing is
deemed also to grant that without which the grant
itself would be of no effect"
<i>("Cuicungue aliquis quid</i> <i>concedit concedere videtur et id sine quot
res ipsa esse non potuit"</i>): <b>Broome's Legal Maxims </b>(9th ed) p 307.
The principle is said to go back at least to Shepherds Touchstone 89.
<P>

...
<P>

Thus, if the registered proprietor of land covenants by deed that, until a loan
be repaid, he will not sell or deal with the land,
that covenant would, in my
opinion, create in favour of the covenantee an interest in the land to the
extent at least that an injunction
would go to restrain the covenantor from
dealing with the land in a manner inconsistent with the covenant.  It is not
necessary for
this purpose to pursue the nature of the estates or interests in
land which, under the conventional law of real property, it was
or is possible
to create.  No is it necessary to distinguish between an estate and an interest
in land.  The right, by the enforcement
of an express or an implied negative
covenant, to restrain a dealing with land is in my opinion an interest in land
within this branch
of the law.  Accordingly, such an interest would, in my
opinion, be within the words 'a legal or equitable estate or interest in
land'
within s 74F(1)."
<P>

20  	There are thus a variety of ways in which the right to lodge a
caveat will arise.  The grammatical construction of s 7D, leaving
aside the
opening words for the moment, would seem to posite another circumstance which
gives a caveatable interest.  The circumstance
is a licensee being a party to
the contract who has obtained a judgment or order of the court.  This could
appropriately be described
as the grammatical or literal meaning of the
provision.  It is notable that when the Act in other circumstances seeks to
strike down
a clause in a contract it does so expressly.  See s 7C which
declares void any arbitration provision.  
<P>

21  	It is necessary to look at the Act to try and discern the nature
of its purpose in accordance with the principles I have referred
to above.  If
one does, one finds an Act which applies to a limited class of building work
where the particular people likely to
be affected are, apart from the builders,
owners of residential property.  Division 1 deals with the contracts which are
entered
into for such work and contains a series of restrictions on matters
such as insertion of arbitration clauses, amount of deposit and
the form of
such contracts.  One then moves through other divisions which regulate the
licensing of people to do work, obviously
for the benefit of the consumer being
the home owner and further provisions which provide statutory warranties to
benefit the home
owner.  The Act then deals with a variety of other matters
such as disputes, insurance and penalties.  
<P>

22  	Division 1, to which I have referred, deals with contracting for
work.  It contains a number of prohibitions and applies certain
requirements
for the contracts in question.  In particular s 6(1) provides that s 7 and s 7D
apply to a contract under which the
holder of a licence undertakes to do, inter
alia, any residential building work.  Section 7 deals with the form of such
contracts
and prescribes a number of things that must be complied with and also
proscribes a number of things which are not to be included.
 Section 7C
provides that an arbitration clause in any such agreement is void.  When one
comes to s 7D the first line, which I take
not to be a heading, is "Extent of
Caveatable Interest in Land Under Contract".  If one then looks at the
remainder of the section
which follows one finds nothing within it which
qualifies the amount or "extent" of the caveatable interest.  All the latter
part
does is say that a licence holder who has a judgment has a caveatable
interest in the land.
<P>

23  	This tends to suggest that "extent" has a different meaning
other than defining the ambit of a particular caveatable interest.
 If the
purpose of the Act and in particular this division is to protect an individual
owner of residential land then a more natural
construction of the word "extent"
might see it as being a restrictive provision.  Given as I have pointed out
above that a caveatable
interest can arise in a variety of circumstances even
where the contract does not contain an express clause having as a legal result
a caveatable interest such as the first two examples quoted above, a different
interpretation of the word "extent" becomes more apparent.
 It is in effect a
restriction on all caveatable interests and requires there to be a licence
holder who has obtained a judgment.
 This construction is supported by the
terms of the second reading speech which I have referred to before.  Whether
the section gives
a caveatable interest where the law would not have previously
found one is not a matter which requires a decision in this case.
<P>

24  	It seems to me therefore that the proper construction of s 7D is
one which provides for the section to restrict a caveatable
interest to the
holder of a licence who has a judgment or order of the court in his favour.  As
this is not the case in the present
matter the point should be determined
against the plaintiff.  The appropriate orders are that the plaintiff forthwith
withdraw caveat
5240488W and the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs of the
motion and the proceedings and I so order.
