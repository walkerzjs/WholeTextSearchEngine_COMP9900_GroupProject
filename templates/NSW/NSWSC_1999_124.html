<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>: - The Plaintiff's claim is in these terms:
<P>

	<i> "1.  A Declaration that the land contained in Certificate of </i>
<P>

<i>        Title Volume 10760 Folio 152, being Lot 1 in Deposited </i>
<P>

<i>        Plan227479 extends to the boundary with American Creek </i>
<P>

<i>        in the position shown in:-</i>
<P>

<i>	a) The plan shown in Certificate of Title </i>
<P>

<i>         Volume 10760 Folio 152 and/or</i>
<P>

<i>	b)      Deposited Plan 227479.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.     A Declaration that the Plaintiff is the Registered Proprietor
</i>
<P>

<i>       of the whole of the land shown in the plan annexed hereto </i>
<P>

<i>      and marked `A'."</i>
<P>

2	The plan marked "A" was prepared for the purposes of this case by Mr Peter
Howick, photogrammetrist, on the basis of an aerial
photograph of August
1963.
<P>

3	This litigation relates to establishing the position of the boundary between
Lot 1 and Lot 2 subdivided by Deposited Plan 227479.
The parties' lands are on
the eastern side of Princes Highway at Figtree, New South Wales.  The
Plaintiff's land is the site of the
Sovereign Inn Motel and has a long frontage
to the Princes Highway. The Defendant's land is the site of Figtree Gardens
Caravan Park;
as subdivided it had a short frontage to Princes Highway
immediately north of American Creek but it has now been thrown in with other
land to form Lot 10 DP 609167 and has access to Princes Highway through Woodrow
Place.  In DP 227479 and in all certificates of title
which adopt it to
describe land the boundary is the western bank of American Creek.  DP 227479
shows the line of the western bank
with the words <i>"western bank is common
boundary",</i> but the line of the bank is an irregular line as one would
expect in nature, no lengths or bearings of the bank are shown, and in
all
practicality they could not be shown.  All the other boundaries of both lots
are described with lengths and bearings (and the
bearings of the chords of two
curved lines).
<P>

4	The western bank is the only common boundary between Lot 1 and Lot 2.  The
northern limit of the common boundary is shown on the
Deposited Plan, and the
lengths and bearings of other lines enable the position of that point to be
established.  The southern limit
is also shown but the parties are in dispute
as to the interpretation of information and dimensions on the plan which enable
its
position to be established.
<P>

5	Orders as claimed in the Summons would do not more than state the obvious and
would not function to resolve the controversy. I
do not find it easy to state
clearly what the controversy is and the parties did not state it clearly, but
it is to the effect that
the Plaintiff contends that the true boundary is
further to the east, and that the Plaintiff owns more land along the margin of
American
Creek, than the Defendant will accept. 
<P>

6	The litigation was precipitated by the Plaintiff setting about doing works to
build retaining or reinforcing works at the western
margin of American Creek so
as to protect the Plaintiff's land and its building from erosion.  The
Plaintiff commenced construction
of a retaining wall composed of hard fill with
the approval of the Water Resources Commission, but without development consent
of
the Wollongong City Council.  When it embarked on these works the Plaintiff
came into collision with powers exercised by Wollongong
City Council, and was
prevailed on to apply for development consent for the works. The Plaintiff was
then subjected to a condition
of development consent that it obtain the
Defendant's consent for the construction of works on what the Council had
satisfied itself
was part of the Defendant's land.  The Council acted on a
survey report which it commissioned for Mr Surveyor Neil Craig Johnston
in June
1996. As the Plaintiff did not accept that the land was part of the Defendant's
land, and claimed that it was its own, it
commenced proceedings in the Land and
Environment Court challenging the condition which referred to it, and later
commenced the present
proceedings.
<P>

7	Descriptions of land bounded by water recurringly produce difficulties when
there is a need, after elapse of time, to establish
what the former margins
were.  See Mr J E Moore's article <i>"Land by the Water"</i> at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=41%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20532" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">41 ALJ 532.</a>
Often the location of a stream has changed with time. Where a boundary
description refers to the bank of a stream, the position of
the bank may move
and observers may differ in their assessment of what the bank is. Where the
course of a stream changes over time
gradually and imperceptibly, the title
boundary defined by reference to the stream will also alter, bringing an
accretion in area
to one proprietor and a decretion to the other.  Accretions
consisting of deliberate reinforcement or reconstruction of a bank do
not alter
title to land.  On accretion see <i>Southern Centre of Theosophy v South
Australia</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20AC%20706" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] AC 706</a> and <i>Verrall v Nott</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1939/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1939] NSWStRp 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281939%29%2039%20SRNSW%2089" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1939) 39 SRNSW 89</a> at
99-101.
<P>

8	There have been significant alterations to the surrounding topography and, on
several occasions, works have been carried out affecting
the banks and bed of
American Creek which have altered the flow of the stream and the shape and
location of the banks. These artificial
works and any changes in the location
of the bank which they have produced cannot alter the location of the boundary.
The recent
survey in evidence dealing with the location of the bank at the
southern limit of the common boundary shows that the bank there is
in the same
position as the bank at the time of the survey work which produced the
Deposited Plan.
<P>

9	When the plan of survey which became DP 227479 was prepared, <i>Survey
Practice Regulation</i> 1933 appears to have contemplated that a boundary of
land abutting a non-tidal stream might be described by reference to the bank;
see particularly Regulation 35. The practice of surveyors was probably
influenced by the definitions of <i>"bank"</i> and <i>"bed"</i> which then
appeared in s 235A of the <i>Crown Lands Consolidation Act</i> 1913; that
section seems to have affected survey practice although it did not in terms
apply to a plan of subdivision of private
land and its application to Crown
land except as to non-tidal lakes was very limited.  (See now <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cla1989134/s172.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 172</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cla1989134/" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Lands Act </i>1989</a>.)  In subs 235A(1) were the following
definitions:
<P>

	<i>" `Bank' means the limit of the bed of any lake or rivers.</i>
<P>

<i>	`Bed' means the whole of the soil of any lake or river including that
portion thereof which is alternately covered and left bare
as there may be an
increase or diminution in the supply of water and which is adequate to contain
it at its average or mean stage
without reference to extraordinary freshets  in
time of flood or to extreme droughts."</i>
<P>

10	This definition of <i>"bed"</i> in its turn appears to be adapted from a
passage in the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States applying the
word <i>"bank"</i> in <i>State of Alabama v State of Georgia</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1859/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1859] USSC 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281860%29%2064%20US%20505" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1860) 64 US
505</a> at 514-515 and its citation by A L Smith LJ in <i>Hindson v Ashby</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1896%5d%202%20Ch%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1896] 2 Ch 1</a> at 25-26; see too <i>Thames Conservators v Smeed, Dean &amp;
Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1897%5d%202%20QB%20334" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1897] 2 QB 334</a> at 338.
<P>

11	In <i>Alabama v Georgia</i> the river bank was far inland and was not tidal.
The boundary was established by a contract of cession in 1799 by which Georgia
ceded
to the United States territory which later became Alabama.  The boundary
was established by words which ceded territory <i>"...west of a line beginning
on the western bank of the Chattahoochee river, where the same crosses the
boundary line between the
United States and Spain;  running thence up the said
river Chattahoochee, and along the western bank thereof...".</i>  Counsel for
Alabama contended for<i> "...the usual or common low-water mark..."</i> and
counsel for Georgia contended for <i>"...the outer bed line..."</i>.  The Court
was called on to expound the meaning of the word <i>"bank,"</i> and did so by
distinguishing the bank of a river from its bed.  After referring to a number
of earlier decisions and learned authors
Wayne J for the Supreme Court said, at
514-515:-
<P>

	<i>"Notwithstanding that there are differences of expression in the preceding
citations, they all concur as to what a river is;  what
its banks are;  that
they are distinct from the shore or flat, and as to what constitutes its
channel.</i>
<P>

<i>	With these authorities and the pleadings of this suit in view, all of us
reject the low-water mark claimed by Alabama as the line
that was intended by
the contract of cession between the United States and Georgia.  And all of us
concur in this conclusion, that
by the contract of cession, Georgia ceded to
the United States all of her lands west of a line beginning on the western bank
of the
Chattahoochee river where the same crosses the boundary line between the
United States and Spain, running up the said Chattahoochee
river and along the
western bank thereof.</i>
<P>

<i>	We also agree and decide that this language implies that there is ownership
of soil and jurisdiction in Georgia in the bed of the
river Chatahoochee, and
that the bed of the river is that portion of its soil which is alternately
covered and left bare, as there
may be an increase or diminution in the supply
of water, and which is adequate to contain it at its average and mean stage
during
the entire year, without reference to the extraordinary freshets of the
winter or spring, or the extreme droughts of the summer or
autumn.</i>
<P>

<i>	The western line of the cession on the Chatahoochee river must be traced on
the water line of the acclivity of the western bank,
and along that bank where
that is defined;  and in such places on the river where the western bank is not
defined, it must be continued
up the river on the line of its bed, as that is
made by the average and mean stage of the water, as that is expressed in the
conclusion
of the preceding paragraph of this opinion."</i>
<P>

12	See too the commentary in Hallmann's <i>"Legal Aspects of Boundary Surveying
as apply in New South Wales"</i> 2ndedition 1994 at pages 13-123 to 13-125.
<P>

13	I see no reason to think that the meaning of <i>"bank"</i> as used by Mr
Williams in 1965 was different to its meaning in 1799 or in 1860.
<P>

14	Deposited Plan 227479 was prepared by Mr Surveyor Keith Frederick Williams
of Wollongong upon survey work completed on 22 June
1965; there were minor (and
not presently relevant), amendments to the plan on 28 February 1966 and the
plan was registered on 23
March 1966. At that time the land was owned with Old
System title by Mr &amp; Mrs J S Barham. A statement on the plan showed that
the proprietors intended to dedicate two strips of land of variable width
fronting Princes Highway to the public for road purposes.
One of these strips
lay along the full length of the lines forming the north-western boundary of
Lot 1 between Lot 1 and the Princes
Highway.  (The other strip is not now
relevant.)  The dedications took effect in some way at or soon after
registration of the plan,
so that the Princes Highway directly abutted Lot 1 to
the north-west. 
<P>

15	Mr &amp; Mrs Barham conveyed Lot 1 to Mr Kenneth Albert Dean by conveyance
dated 1 April 1966 No. 573 Book 2787. Mr Dean brought
Lot 1 under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real
Property Act</a></i> by primary application 44974 lodged on 4 May 1966, and
obtained Certificate of Title Vol. 10760 folio 152 on 19 March 1968. The
registered
proprietorship passed through several hands and at least one later
edition of Certificate of Title Vol. 10760 folio 152. The Plaintiff
is now the
registered proprietor of Lot 1 under computer folio certificate 1/227479,
edition 3 of 11 October 1996.  The Lot has been
reduced by another and later
widening of Princes Highway.  Deposited Plan 248743 was prepared by Mr Surveyor
Denis John Clark, the
Department of Main Roads' own surveyor, on survey work
completed on 24 June 1974 and registered on 28 November 1974.  Two more strips
with frontage to Princes Highway became Lots 10 and 11 in DP 248743 and were
transferred to the Commissioner for Main Roads by transfer
Q 484930 registered
on 30 October 1978 and those two lots were later resumed -- notification
T198086 registered 12 October 1982.
 The Plaintiff's Certificate of Title bears
a notification that these strips are now public road. Subject to a notification
referring
to these strips the Plaintiff's Certificate of Title identifies the
land as Lot 1 DP 227479, so the meaning of  the Certificate of
Title depends on
the meaning of the Deposited Plan.
<P>

16	There have been some changes too in the parcel of land now held by the
Defendant.  The area of Lot 2 DP 227479 was 27 acres,
2 roods 13&#188; perches.
Mr Surveyor Robert Ackerman of the Department of Main Roads completed a survey
on 17 December 1969 for
DP 544690 registered on 7 October 1970.  A parcel of 1
acre, 0 roods, 29 perches created by DP 544690 was excised, and was acquired
by
the Department of Main Roads in or after 1970;  that parcel was in the
easternmost part of Lot 1 DP 227479 at the most distant
point from American
Creek, and it was acquired for another road, a Freeway and not for the Princes
Highway.  That subdivision did
not require any survey work relating to the
American Creek boundary.  The rest of Lot 2 DP 227479 became Lot 1 DP 544690.
DP 248743
appears to create a small Lot 13 between Princes Highway and Lot 1
and Lot 2 DP 227479, but so far as appears this was not a deduction
from Lot 2
DP 227479.
<P>

17	Deposited Plan 609162 was prepared by Mr Surveyor Francis Christopher
Collaery, who was a member of Mr Surveyor Williams' firm.
He completed his
survey work on 23 February 1978 and DP 609162 was registered on 12 June 1980.
By this time the land now owned by
the Defendant had also been brought under
the Torrens System. Lot 1 DP 544690 was thrown in with other land to the north,
which also
had frontage to Princes Highway, and re-subdivided to form and
dedicate Woodrow Place.  Part of Lot 1 DP 544690 fell within Woodrow
Place.
Again the survey work for this plan did not involve establishing the location
of the boundary at the western bank of American
Creek.
<P>

18	The Defendant's title is now shown by folio identifier 10/609167 dated 24
August 1995, which identifies the land as <i>"Lot 10 in Deposited Plan
609167"</i> and so incorporates the description of the common boundary in DP
609167.  The Defendant's Certificate of Title is prior in time to
the
Plaintiff's.  The problem is not one of priority between inconsistent
Certificates of Title, because each adopts a Deposited
Plan in its description
of the land certified and the plans use the same description for the common
boundary.
<P>

19	In these Deposited Plans the boundary is always represented in a way
obviously derived from Deposited Plan 227479; no additional
survey information
was introduced which would establish the location of the western bank or any
point on it.  In Deposited Plan 609167,
the last of the series, the common
boundary is indicated with the statement "western bank is common boundary", in
the same way as
in DP 227479.  However, in DP 609167 those words are applied to
a longer stretch of the western bank, and also indicate the common
boundary
between the Defendant's land and other land to the south of the Plaintiff's
land, land in DP 162049.
<P>

20	DP 162049, formerly known as MPS(OS) 12049 was also prepared by Mr Surveyor
Williams, in survey work completed on 14 November
1956.  DP 162049 establishes
the boundaries of only one lot, Lot 1 DP 162049, of 2 acres, 3 roods, 35&#188;
perches, and does not
state that it is a plan of subdivision.  Although DP
162049 does not give comprehensive references to the land to the north and east
which the Plaintiff and the Defendant now own it is clear enough that Lot 1 DP
162049 had common boundaries with the lands of the
present parties.  American
Creek is shown and the western boundary bears the notation <i>"bank of creek is
boundary"</i> for the boundary between Lot 1 DP 162049 and what is now part of
the Defendant's land.
<P>

21	DP162049 and DP227479 contain statements which show that the land in each of
them is part of the Barhams' land in conveyance
Number 27 Book 2300, shown in
Mr Dean's primary application as the conveyance dated 3 August 1954 by which Mr
&amp; Mrs Barham took
their title.
<P>

22	In my opinion the location of the parties' boundary is to be established by
establishing the meaning of DP 227479 and applying
it to the facts. It is DP
227479 by reference to which the Plaintiff's title is certified, and the survey
work for the plan by reference
to which the Defendant's title is certified is
derivative from DP 227479;  that survey work introduces no new information and
states
no other view of where the common boundary is.
<P>

23	In <i>National Trustees Executors and Agency Co v Hassett</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1907/77.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1907] VicLawRp 77</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1907%5d%20VLR%20404" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1907] VLR 404</a>
at 412 Cussen J said to the effect that land surveying is not an exact science
like mathematics, and that the plan is intended merely
as a picture of what is
found on the ground.
<P>

24	DP 227479 is a document. Like other documents, to come to an understanding
of its meaning it is necessary to have regard to the
Deposited Plan as a whole,
and to all dimensions and bearings in it which could indicate what was intended
to be shown as the western
bank and the common boundary. As with other
documents, it is possible that the information in it may include statements
which are
internally inconsistent and that the inconsistencies may require to
be resolved to arrive at its meaning.  Everything the Deposited
Plan says in
the many dimensions, bearings and statements on it which are relevant to
establishing Lot 1 is a description by a person
of a piece of land, and the
exercise for any person, including the court, who seeks to ascertain the
meaning and effect of the Deposited
Plan is to identify the piece of land which
Mr Surveyor Williams described in his plan of survey.  It is not the exercise
to fulfil
literally each and every dimension bearing and statement:  that may
not be possible.
<P>

25	It is sometimes necessary to give relatively less weight to figured
dimensions than to monuments and reference marks and to abuttals.
The Judicial
Committee reviewed authorities on ambiguous descriptions in <i>Watcham v East
Africa Protectorate</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1919%5d%20AC%20533" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1919] AC 533</a>; at 541 their Lordships said:-
<P>

	<i> "Where a deed contains an adequate and sufficient definition of the
property which it was intended to pass, any erroneous statements
contained in
it as to the dimensions or quality of the property, or any inaccuracy in a plan
by which it purports to be described
will not vitiate this
description:......"</i>
<P>

26	An instance where figures on a plan were not treated as controlling the
meaning of the description in the plan was <i>Small v Glen </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281880%29%206%20VLR%20154" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1880) 6 VLR
154:</a>  see 161-162.  However there are no general rules of law according primacy
in all cases to abuttals or monuments; the question is
always one of the
construction of the instruments of title.  Finding the actual sites of the
boundaries as they were at the date
of the Deposited Plan is a much more
pressing consideration than finding some resolution in which all the stated
dimensions are literally
fulfilled.
<P>

27	A Certificate of Title is an ordinary written instrument and must be
construed in accordance with the ordinary rules for the
construction of
documents of title, and without extrinsic evidence to identify its subject
matter it has no intelligible meaning:
 see per Griffith CJ in <i>Overland v
Lenehan</i> (1901) 11 QLJ 59 at 60.
<P>

28	The Plaintiff's counsel pointed out correctly that the Plaintiff is not
affected by the exception to indefeasibility in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> (1) (c) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real

<P>

29	The Defendant's Certificate of Title folio identifier 10/609167 is the
earlier in date.  The case does not turn on priority in
time of certificates of
title under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> (1) (a) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a></i>.
<P>

30	Identifying the land described and accepting the indefeasibility of title to
that land are quite different things.  The Certificate
of Title certifies title
and does not certify that the land has all the dimensions and characteristics
attributed to it in the Deposited
Plan.  As with other documents which are
human productions, it must be recognised and accepted that there may be
inaccuracies and
misdescriptions, which may appear either wholly from an
attempt to resolve among themselves the statements in the plan or from an
attempt to apply the plan to the facts found on the ground. Where
inconsistencies appear it is necessary to press on and to make
a finding on the
probabilities about what land was the subject of description (even imperfect
description) in the Deposited Plan
when it was written in 1965.
<P>

31	If the piece of land actually available at Figtree is not as large as the
piece of land shown and described in the Deposited
Plan, having regard to the
positions of the reference marks, the dimensions and bearings, the western bank
of American Creek and
the location of lands occupied by adjoining owners, then
the Deposited Plan and the description in it have to be accommodated to
the
facts, and the Court has to accept that there has been an erroneous
description.  (In a similar way the Court may have to accept
that more land is
available than a Deposited Plan would show).  Elements in a description which
it can be taken with fair certainty
are in the same position as when the land
was subdivided, such as reference marks consisting of galvanised iron pipes and
spikes
and natural features such as the western bank of American Creek, have a
much stronger claim to acceptance than parts of the description
such as
dimensions and bearings which are the product of surveyor's work and for that
reason susceptible to error.
<P>

32	If the accuracy of all the bearings and dimensions given by Mr Surveyor
Williams is assumed it should be possible to mark out
exactly on the ground the
positions of all the surveyed lines which form the boundaries of Lot 1 other
than American Creek. This
is so because they were related by Mr Surveyor
Williams to a number of permanent reference marks, four galvanised iron spikes
at
points on or slightly offset from the boundaries and several others at other
points. With that information it is possible to establish
by survey where
according to the information expressed in the plan the northern and southern
limits of the common boundary on the
western bank of American Creek were when
Mr Surveyor Williams did his survey work in 1965.  Mr Surveyor Williams did not
incorporate
any survey information in his Deposited Plan which can establish
where the western bank was, except at the northern and southern
limits.  He
simply adopted an expression which identified the common boundary by reference
to a natural feature, and his plan must
be understood to have been referring to
the position of the western bank as a natural feature at the time of his
survey. The words
he used referred to the position of the western bank at that
time, and to apply them to the facts it is necessary to establish where
the
western bank then was.  The position of the boundary has not been changed by
any  gradual accretions and decretions, and there
cannot have been any change
in the meaning of the description of the boundary in the Deposited Plan.
<P>

33	For most of the present century survey work has been conducted to a high
professional standard and with improving techniques.
 Plans referred to in the
Torrens register have been the subject of meticulous official examination, so
that it is unusual (but not
unknown) to encounter litigation arising out of
anomalies in modern survey work. This happy state of affairs should not conceal
the
fact that a survey plan is a description of something which exists on the
surface of the earth and is different to the exercise of
describing it by the
plan, and that there may be mistakes or anomalies.  Where there is some
ambiguity or other doubt about the meaning
of a Deposited Plan, evidence about
the facts and circumstances which surrounded the preparation of the plan is
admissible in order
to identify its subject-matter and come to a finding about
its meaning, and that evidence can include evidence about the physical
features
of the land at the time when the plan was prepared and can also include
evidence about the survey work, the field notes
and the observations of the
surveyor at the time of preparing the plan, so as to identify the piece of land
he was attempting to
describe. I rejected objections to evidence which were
based on the view that resort is limited to material publicly available,
whether
in the Deposited Plan or elsewhere, and I admitted evidence of field
notes made by Mr Surveyor Williams or by his technical assistant
in this and
earlier surveys. I have not found those field notes of much use except as
interpreted and applied by Mr Surveyor Johnson
in his survey based on them.
<P>

34	The survey evidence adduced in chief on behalf of the Plaintiff was given by
Mr Surveyor Roger Philip Farrington and by Mr Peter
Howick.  Mr Howick is an
Associate of the Institution of Surveyors, Australia, and has other
qualifications in surveying. Mr Howick
is experienced in photogrammetry and
works as the Manager of AAM Surveys Pty Limited, and has done so for many
years. He prepared
a series of plans, exhibits C, D, E and F which are based on
aerial photography and survey information furnished to him by Mr Surveyor
Farrington. Mr Surveyor Farrington established information by survey from
existing survey marks so as to define the boundaries of
Lot 1, particularly its
eastern boundary. He also established and provided to Mr Howick co-ordinates of
physical features on the
ground which would have been visible in aerial
photography of 1963, 1972 and 1984.
<P>

35	Mr Surveyor Farrington did not establish the position of the western bank of
American Creek as shown in DP 227479, and in my
understanding it would not be
possible for him to do this by survey from existing survey marks as shown on
the Deposited Plan or
elsewhere. Mr Surveyor Farrington worked to a high degree
of accuracy and furnished Mr Howick with field survey photography dated
1963,
1972 and 1984 from the New South Wales State Aerial Photography Library at the
Land Information Centre Bathurst, and Mr Howick
used the information available
to him to establish and compare changes to the course of American Creek and the
position of its middle
thread during the period from 1963 to 1984.  In his
photogrammetric mapping Mr Howick obtained his orientations from topographic
maps and from the field survey data provided by Mr Surveyor Farrington. In
Exhibit C he showed the position of the middle thread
of American Creek as
indicated by the 1963 aerial photography and also plotted the line of the
south-western boundary of Lot 1 DP
227479 as established by the field survey
data. In doing so he adopted the length of that line at 100.115 metres.
<P>

36	This is the interpretation which Mr Surveyor Farrington made and for which
the Plaintiff contends of what is stated in DP 227479
as the length of that
line.  100.115 metres is the result of Mr Surveyor Farrington's conversion of
336 feet to metric measurements
and deduction of 2.3 metres for the width of
Lot 10 DP 248743 transferred to the Department of Main Roads.
<P>

37	Exhibit D plots the position of the south-western boundary in relation to
the middle thread of American Creek as interpreted
by Mr Howick from the 1972
aerial photography.  The position deduced for 1972 is a very small distance
west of the position deduced
for 1963.  Mr Horwick's work shows little change
in the position of the middle thread of the creek between 1963 and 1972.
<P>

38	Exhibit E shows the position of the boundary line in relation to the
position of the middle thread of the creek as deduced from
the 1984 aerial
photography. This comparison shows that the middle thread of American Creek had
again moved a small distance eastward.

<P>

39	Exhibit F shows the position of the same boundary in relation to the
position of the middle thread of the creek as established
by field survey by Mr
Surveyor Farrington in 1997. The positions shown for American Creek for 1984
and 1997 are almost identical,
a little east of the position deduced for
1963.
<P>

40	In relation to the orders of accuracy given by Mr Howick for his conclusions
based on photogrammetry the variations appearing
from his plans can only be
very small. Presumably Mr Howick's work in these plans is the basis of the plan
annexed to the Summons,
which appears to be part of the same series but
asserts, in relation to the interpretation of the 1963 aerial photography, that
there
was a distance of 3 metres from the south-eastern limit of the
south-western boundary to the middle thread of the creek and the same
distance
from the north-eastern limit of Lot 1 to the middle thread of the creek. Mr
Howick's evidence does not however establish
that the relevant dimension is 3
metres and it is not dealt with anywhere in the evidence; so no conclusion can
be based on the plan
annexed to the Summons.
<P>

41	Mr Howick's work shows that there have been significant changes in the
watercourse in other respects, and also in the line of
the points interpreted
by Mr Howick as change of grade.  In Mr Howick's plans the middle thread of the
creek is in the position which
Mr Howick's interpretation of that aerial
photography would establish. Mr Howick did not purport to establish where the
bank was;
he was not asked to define the western bank and would not have been
able to do so with material on which he worked. In explaining
this he said that
banks as seen on the photographs are indistinct and there is no fairly visible
line of the bank.  He said "The
shape of the bank of the river is generally a
subtle shape and from the water course it curves open out on to the upper flats
so
therefore the actual position of the bank is a subjective judgment. We are
not able to say that is where the edge of the bank is."
Some of his drawings
show a line which in his interpretation from aerial photography is a line where
there is a change of grade;
but he does not put this forward as establishing
the bank.
<P>

42	Essentially the force of Mr Howick's work is to establish the positions of
the change of grade and the middle thread of the creek
at the dates with which
the aerial photography deals and to relate the positions of the middle thread
of the creek, the proximity
of which to the boundary shows relatively little
change, in relation of the orders of accuracy observed.
<P>

43	As the distance from the end of the south-western boundary (as established
according to Mr Surveyor Farrington's interpretation
and survey work) to the
middle thread is not shown, as the middle thread of American Creek is not
referred to in DP 227479 and is
of no assistance in interpreting the Deposited
Plan and as the position of the western bank of American Creek is not
established
at any date by Mr Howick's and Mr Surveyor Farrington's work, I am
of the opinion that their work has no real value in interpreting
the plan and
applying it to the facts. I could not attribute any value to any supposed
resolution which did not attempt to establish
in some way the position of the
western bank of American Creek at the date of Mr Surveyor Williams' survey
work, or to find some
resolution between the position of the western bank so
established and the other available information. The natural feature to which
the Deposited Plan so deliberately and prominently referred is too important to
be passed by.
<P>

44	Mr Howick expressed the conclusion that as at 1963 the middle thread of the
creek was within approximately 3 metres of the north-eastern
fixed boundary of
the site, while it was within approximately 5 metres of the south-eastern fixed
boundary of the site. As his evidence
does not show how he established what he
refers to as fixed boundaries of the site, this evidence is of no value to me.
It does not
support any finding about where the western bank of American Creek
was in 1965.
<P>

45	The only evidence which had significant force for establishing the position
of the western bank in 1965 was adduced by the Defendant.
<P>

46	As the evidence and arguments developed, a predominating burden of attention
fell on the southern limit of the common boundary.
The evidence exposed an
anomaly between the position of the bank there as established by Mr Surveyor
Johnson in relatively recent
survey work for Wollongong City Council in June
1996 and more recently for this litigation, and as re-established by him using
Mr
Surveyor Williams' field notes, and the position which the southern limit
has as the plan is interpreted by Mr Surveyor Farrington;
 in that
interpretation the south-western boundary of Lot 1 was 336 feet 0 inches long.
The Plaintiff's position is that that boundary
is 336 feet 0 inches long. This
to my reading is the ordinary and natural meaning of the figures marked on the
plan. If the ordinary
conventions for indicating dimensions on survey plans had
been followed, 32 feet 1 inches would appear in brackets if it was part
of a
longer line the length of which was also given.  If that boundary truly is and
was 336 feet 0 inches long its south-eastern
terminal point is not in any
position which is or ever could have been credibly a position on the western
bank of American Creek;
Mr Surveyor Johnson's evidence seems to show this and
there was no endeavour to establish in cross-examination of Mr Johnson or
otherwise
in evidence that this is not so.  In a way Mr Howick's evidence seems
to confirm it by showing that terminal point as being very
close to the middle
thread of the creek.  As the presentation of issues developed the case became a
struggle about which view was
to prevail;  the view that the terminal point is
where the bank was and is or the view that the terminal point is further
eastward,
at a point established by accepting that the south-western boundary
is 336 feet 0 inches long and disregarding the resulting inaccuracy
of the
statement that the terminal point was on the western bank of American Creek.
<P>

47	Mr Johnson's survey work and evidence show his view that the point at which
that line intersects the western bank is the same
now as it was in 1965.  He
conducted a peg survey of the western bank using Mr Surveyor Williams' field
notes, re-established the
lines of traverse measurement on the eastern side of
American Creek together with radiations to the western bank and offsets to the
eastern bank, and established and defined the location of points on the bank as
they were at the time of his own survey in 1996 and
as they were when observed
by Mr Surveyor Williams in 1965. Annexure H to his affidavit of 11 September
1997 illustrates that by
survey he established eleven positions on the western
bank as they were in 1965 from radiations made and noted by Mr Surveyor
Williams
in 1965. The traverses form part of the Deposited Plan; the radiations
do not, and they are found only in the field notes and not
in publicly
available material. Mr Surveyor Johnson's work shows, as illustrated by
Annexure G to his affidavit, that for most of
its length the western bank as it
now stands is now significantly further east than the western bank was in 1965,
to a maximum of
12 metres. These alterations must be attributed to artificial
works, and not to gradual accretions, and there was no claim in the
Plaintiff's
case that there had been gradual accretions.
<P>

48	The field notes do not show the length of the disputed boundary as
ascertained by survey in 1965, and they do not show by radiation
or otherwise
that the intersection between the south-western boundary and the western bank
was established or marked.
<P>

49	To illustrate the contentions about the length of the south-western boundary
of Lot 1 I have incorporated an extract from DP227479
as a schedule to this
judgment. That boundary is part of a line bearing 110&#176; 51' 40" on which
five points can be identified.
I have indicated these points in the extract.
<P>

50	The first, which Mr Johnson in evidence called Point A (t 27) is at the
intersection between the Princes Highway boundary and
the <i>"strip for
widening variable widths"</i> on DP 227479.  This is indicated by a Reference
Mark which Mr Williams found, a galvanised pipe at an offset from that point.
The
next point which I designate Point C is at the intersection of a curved
line which is a boundary between Lot 1 DP 227479 and the
<i>"strip for
widening"</i> on DP 227479, shown as 32 feet 1 inch wide (9.375m).  Mr Surveyor
Williams gave the location of this point by an offset from a Reference
Mark, a
galvanised iron spike.  The next point on that line is not shown on DP 227479
or designated by Mr Johnson:  it is the eastern
limit of the second
road-widening (Lot 10 DP 248743) which at this point was 2.3m wide:  I
designate it Point D.  The next point
is the intersection between the line and
the western bank which I designate Point E.  The next point is the intersection
between
the prolongation of the line as a traverse and another traverse line on
the eastern side of American Creek which Mr Surveyor Williams
established.  Mr
Johnson designated this Point B.  Figured dimensions on DP 227479 give the
length of line C - E at 336 feet 0 inches
(102.41m) the length of line E - B as
95 feet 6&#190; inches and the length of line C - B as 431 feet 6&#190; inches:
and these are
arithmetically consistent.
<P>

51	There was no evidence other than the evidence of Mr Surveyor Johnson who was
called by the Defendant which would tend to establish
where the western bank of
American Creek is and was at its intersection with a line bearing 110&#176; 51'
40" from point C.
<P>

52	Mr Johnson also established and pegged the position of Point E, and measured
the boundary D - E at 90.33m.  This is inconsistent
with the reading put
forward by the Plaintiff, which would produce 100.11m as the length of D - E by
deducting 2.3m for line C -
D from 336 feet 0 inches (102.41m).  However Mr
Johnson's measurement of D - E is consistent with 336 feet 0 inches (102.41m)
being
the length of the line A - E, as deduction of A - C at 32 feet 1 inch
(9.775m) and C - D at 2.3m from 102.41m produces 90.335m, which
for practical
purposes is what Mr Johnson found.
<P>

53	Mr Surveyor Johnson also presented an analysis of the dimensions of Lot 1,
particularly the south-western boundary, based on
closure calculations. If a
lot shown on a survey plan is a regular straight-sided figure the dimensions
and bearings of each line
forming part of the boundary can be analysed in terms
of Cartesian geometry. An identical figure can be constructed geometrically
using the same dimensions and bearings, and if all the dimensions and bearings
are consistent the construction of the figure will
return one to the point of
commencement. When this occurs surveyors speak of the result as <i>"a
close"</i>; when it does not there is <i>"a misclose"</i> and there must have
been some error in the statements of dimensions and bearings. Cartesian
geometry cannot be easily applied to
all boundaries of Lot 1 because the
western bank is irregular and its dimensions and bearings have not been given,
but the dimensions
and bearings which have been given can be tested by a
closure calculation on the regular figure produced by the dimensions and
bearings
which are given and traverse lines shown on DP 227479, which with them
produce an imaginary straight-sided geometrical figure. Mr
Surveyor Johnson in
effect reconstructed the traverse lines in his survey work of July 1997 and
used them to establish offsets of
points on the western bank from points on the
traverse lines.  His closure analysis of the figure formed by the traverse
lines and
the straight and regularly curved lines forming boundaries of Lot 1
showed that there is a misclose if 336 feet 0 inches (102.41m)
is taken to be
the length of the line C - E;  that the extent of the misclose is approximately
equal to 32 feet 1 inches (9.775m),
and there is no misclose if the dimension
336 feet 0 inches is taken to refer to the line A - E, the south-western
boundary of Lot
1 on DP 227479 is taken to be 303 feet 1 inches and the
boundary available after alienation of Lot 10 DP 248743 and deduction of
2.3m
is 90.335m.
<P>

54	A third body of material to which I should have regard is furnished by Mr
Surveyor Williams' survey work for Deposited Plan 162049.
 The north-eastern
boundary of Lot 1 DP 162049 can be clearly identified with the line A - E in
Lot 1 DP 227479; it is the same line
before either of the two widenings of
Princes Highway had taken place and it terminated at the western bank of
American Creek. Its
dimension was given as 336 feet 0 inches.
<P>

55	Mr Surveyor Johnson is now a principal of the firm which Mr Williams
established. He was not ever a partner of Mr Williams, who
retired before Mr
Johnson joined the firm and died in 1993. Mr Johnson's survey work in 1997 was
not carried out for one of the parties
but arose from his being retained by the
Wollongong City Council in connection with the development application to it.
He had the
advantage through his firm of access to field notes and files of Mr
Williams which are not publicly available. His explanations of
his methods were
clear and cogent. Particularly telling was his exposition of the close
calculation, which was not challenged by
cross-examination or countervailing
evidence. I found Mr Johnson an impressive witness. His evidence illustrated by
his Annexures
G and H which established the position of the western bank as of
1965 with information from Mr Williams' field notes was not challenged
in
cross-examination and in my finding he had a sound basis for his conclusions
about the position of points on the western bank
as of 1965, including, most
significantly, the intersection of the western bank and the south-western
boundary line. As Mr Surveyor
Farrington, who did not have the same access to
Mr Williams' notes and files but acted on the basis of information in DP
227479,
was of the view that on that information it was not possible to define
the western bank, and as Mr Howick did not attempt to do so,
Mr Surveyor
Johnson's conclusion is not met by any countervailing material.
<P>

56	Mr Surveyor Johnson explained his treatment of the bank in his survey work
of June 1996 (affidavit 11/9/97 para 17) in this way:-
<P>

	<i>"For the purposes of my plan I adopted as the current bank the top of the
bank to the flow of the creek at the time I effected my
survey inspection.  I
did not include inside the current bank definition the leading edges of the
bank where it falls into the waterway.
 Similarly the batter down was
excluded..."</i>
<P>

57	This appears to apply correctly the meaning of "bank" as explained in the
<i>State of Alabama v State of Georgia</i>.  (I have omitted the last passage
of his para. 17, which is difficult to understand and may be confused.) As
evidence shows that
the rate of flow of water in American Creek and the height
of the flow ranges very widely, it appears to me that Mr Johnson acted
appropriately. For establishing the location of the bank as it was in 1965, Mr
Johnson's re-working of the traverse and radiation
from Mr Williams' field
notes, and the pegs which Mr Johnson placed as a result have greater
significance than his assessment on
site of the location of the bank; both
produced the same result.  (The plans showing location of the bank using Mr
Williams' radiations
are Exhibits 3 and 4 -- slightly amended from annexures to
Mr Johnson's affidavit.)
<P>

58	Mr Howick's work did not enable him to establish the position of the bank or
the length of the south-western boundary. Mr Surveyor
Farrington said in
evidence that the boundary is not readily definable and is not physically
evident any more; the bank has been
subject to water flow and has been altered,
and the position of the western bank now is not the result of natural accretion
or erosion.
<P>

59	As I have stated earlier, the need to resort to extrinsic evidence to
identify the subject matter described in the Certificate
of Title and Deposited
Plan is inherent in the subject matter of applying a description in a document
to a parcel of land; extrinsic
evidence may be resorted to for that purpose
without showing the existence of an ambiguity or any other ground for resorting
to extrinsic
material in order to determine the meaning of the document.
Ascertaining the meaning of the Deposited Plan involves  relating it
to its
factual context.  Resort to extrinsic material is further justified by the
misclose which in my opinion is a patent ambiguity
in the Deposited Plan. It is
a patent ambiguity because the application of mathematical reasoning to the
information in the plan
demonstrates, as a matter of logic, that there is a
misclose; this is no less so because many persons including myself have not
retained
the mathematical ability to discern that there is and are in need of
exposition from someone with expertise.
<P>

60	The Plaintiff's counsel accepted in submissions that there is a misclose and
that there is an error somewhere in the statements
about dimensions relating to
the south-western boundary, and contended that the most likely place where
there is a discrepancy of
32 feet 1 inches is in the distance E - B of the
traverse taken between the bank and the traverse line on the eastern side of
American
Creek, given in the plan as 97 feet 6&#190; inches. The reasoning
offered in support of this contention was that it is highly unlikely
that a
line which was an actual boundary line would not be measured, that the length
of this traverse is not part of a boundary as
such but is likely to be the
product of deduction rather than measurement and that that is an opportunity
for intrusion of an error.
I do not accept this submission because it is not
based on any evidence which raised the possibility that the traverse length
might
be erroneous, and given that there is in fact a dimension of 32 feet 1
inches elsewhere on the line it seems to me to be far more
probable that where
there is an error of exactly 32 feet 1 inches the error relates to the
inclusion in some stated dimension of
the 32 feet 1 inches which was expressly
referred to.
<P>

61	In my opinion, the statement that the length of the boundary is 336 feet 0
inches does not gain any force from its repetition
in the conveyance to Mr
Dean, his primary application and in other places, as all are obviously based
on the Deposited Plan, to which
all expressly refer.
<P>

62	Taking these bodies of material together it appears in my finding with fair
certainty that the dimension 336 feet 0 inches which
on a fair reading of DP
227479 is the length of line C - E is a mistake on the part of Mr Surveyor
Williams and that the information
available to him was that the length of line
A - E was 336 feet 0 inches. It is not possible to say exactly how the mistake
occurred
but it may be that he proceeded by transcribing 336 feet 0 inches from
DP 162049 to his new work without adverting to the availability
of the
interpretation that the dimension related only to the boundary of Lot 1 DP
162049, and without adverting to the need to indicate
clearly the length of the
boundary of Lot 1.
<P>

63	This finding resolves the controversy debated before me in favour of the
Defendant. Understood literally, claim 1 in the Summons
is an undisputable
truism but the Plaintiff should not have the benefit of a declaration which has
no utility.
<P>

64	The orders are:
<P>

	1.  The proceedings are dismissed.
<P>

	2.  Costs reserved.
<P>

	
<P>

	
<P>

65	SEE PLAN ANNEXURE "A" TO THE JUDGMENT ATTACHED.
<P>

I hereby certify that paragraphs 1-65 and Annexure "A" are the reasons for
judgment of the Honourable Justice John Bryson.
<P>
