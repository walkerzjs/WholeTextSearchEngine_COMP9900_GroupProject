<b>1393/00 -  PETER MURRAY WALKER &amp; ANOR (APPLICATION OF) (IN THEIR
CAPACITY AS LIQUIDATORS OF SC AUST PTY LTD (LIQ) &amp; SC EQUIPMENT
P/L (LIQ)
&amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (EX TEMPORE)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  This is an application by the liquidators of two companies,
namely SC Australia Pty Ltd (in liquidation) ("SCA")
and SC Equipment Pty Ltd
(in liquidation) ("SCE"). The liquidators seek orders under s 409(6) of the
Corporations Law that SCA and
SCE be deregistered by the Australian Securities
and Investments Commission ("ASIC") one week from today, namely, 7 March
1999.
<P>

2	The relevant facts are as follows. Receivers were appointed to SCA and SCE by
LTCB Australia limited, as trustee for six Japanese
banks, on 4 July 1997. SCA
and SCE were both placed into liquidation on 1 November 1998 consequent upon
the receivers having realised
all of the assets of the two companies and having
directed all of the proceeds of sale of those assets to LTCB for distribution
to
the six Japanese banks. The six Japanese banks are stated to be owed
$282,979,773.05 by SCA and SCE. This amount comprises approximately
98 percent
of all the claims which are provable in liquidation of the two companies.
<P>

3	The liquidators lodged a section 533 report on 4 December 1998. On 16
December 1998 ASIC advised them that it did not propose
to conduct an
investigation into the affairs of either company and it had no objection to
finalising the administration of the companies.
 Consequently final meetings of
the members and creditors of the two companies were held for the purpose of s
509 of the Corporations
Law on 5 February 1999. At those meetings the creditors
who were present passed a resolution approving the present application to
this
Court. After the meetings final returns were lodged with the Commission on 11
February 1999 for the purposes of s 509.  Section
509(5) has the effect that,
those matters having occurred by that date, ASIC is required to deregister the
company on 11 May 1998,
that being the date of expiration of the three month
period after the return was lodged.
<P>

4	In evidence before me today are letters from each of the six Japanese banks
indicating that unless the companies are deregistered
by 31 March 1999, they
will suffer significant financial loss which could be avoided if an order were
made by the Court under s 509(6)
causing the deregistration to occur on a date
prior to 31 March 1999. According to that evidence the actual deregistration of
the
companies is required in order satisfactorily to establish to the National
Administration Agency (the relevant Japanese tax department)
that no further
assets can be recovered from the companies for the benefit of their creditors,
and consequently to permit the Japanese
banks to claim a write-off of the
unrecoverable amount in the current financial year, which in each case, ends on
31 March 1999.
<P>

5	The letters from the banks are supported by an affidavit from Yukenori
Watanabe affirmed on 23 February 1999. Mr Watanabe is an
expert in the relevant
Japanese law and has had considerable experience in dealing with the Japanese
tax authorities in relation
to debt write-offs. While he acknowledges that this
area of Japanese law is currently in an uncertain transitional period, he
expresses
the expert opinion that, according to current practice regarding
financial institutions, the National Administration Agency requires
the most
persuasive and clear evidence that there is absolutely no possibility of
further recovery of the bad debt from the debtor.
 In the case of a corporate
debtor, evidence of that nature would need to be evidence of the cancellation
of the registration of
the debtor within the financial period, in Mr Watanabe's
view.
<P>

6	The present application has been made to me ex parte.  Notice of it has been
supplied to the Australian Securities and Investments
Commission. ASIC has
responded to the solicitors for the plaintiffs by letter of 19 February 1999
advising that it does not require
to be added as a party to these proceedings,
that it neither consents nor opposes the orders sought in the summons, and that
it does
not propose to appear. However, ASIC has requested that it be advised
of the result of the application and that it receive an office
copy of any
orders made, pursuant to s 509(7) of the Corporations Law.
<P>

7	Section 509(6) empowers the Court, on the application (inter alia) of a
liquidator, to make an order that ASIC deregister a company
on a specified day,
provided the Court makes the order within the three month period which in this
case began on 12 February 1999.
  The plaintiff's solicitor has not been able
to refer me to any authority in which s 509(6) has been used in the matter
proposed,
or where an application of the current kind has been refused.
Nevertheless I am persuaded that this is a clear case for the making
of the
order, on the basis that if the order is not made the six Japanese banks would
suffer a loss to which there is no particular
reason to subject them.
<P>

8	Short minutes of orders were handed up. I make orders 1 to 4 in the short
minutes which I initial and date for the purposes of
identification.
