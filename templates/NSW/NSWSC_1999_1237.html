<P>

<b>INTRODUCTION AND PRINCIPAL CONTENTIONS</b>
<P>

<b>The Central Issue</b>
<P>

1   	How far can ASX go when seeking information from officers
and employees in its disciplinary investigations of its member organisations,
by imposing confidentiality undertakings and limiting those present at the
interviews, in order to preserve the integrity of that
investigation?  This is
a question of far-reaching implication for ASX self-regulation, required and
underpinned as it is now by
statute, in preserving an "orderly and fair
market".  It squarely arises in this case.
<P>

2   	By Summons the Plaintiff, the Australian Stock Exchange
Limited ("ASX"), seeks a declaration that the Defendant has failed
to comply
with its Business Rule 13.1(1) and mandatory orders requiring compliance,
pursuant to s777 and s1114 of the <i>Corporations Law</i>.  The alleged failure
consists in the Defendant not requiring certain of its directors to appear
before the ASX for interview "as
directed".  That direction requires certain
undertakings from those, other than the interviewee, the ASX permit to be
present at
the interview, including the Defendant's legal advisers Atanaskovic
Hartnell.  The undertakings are in substance not to disclose
what transpired at
the interviews until they are completed or the ASX's Draft Inspection Report is
provided to the Defendant for
comment, whichever first occurs.  They are sought
by the ASX "to preserve the integrity of the investigation".  The Defendant has
refused such undertakings contending that there is no power to require them.
<P>

3   	There is a further issue.  ASX have declined approval for
one particular person, Mr McLeod Managing Director of the Defendant's
parent,
responsible for the group's internal policies and procedures, to be present at
the interviews or to provide instructions
to the legal advisers.  That refusal
is because Mr McLeod is a prospective interviewee and may inhibit the answers
of others for
reasons elaborated below.
<P>

4   	Can ASX insist on such undertakings and prevent Mr McLeod's
presence, at least until he is examined?  That turns on the proper
interpretation of ASX Business Rule 13.1(1), which is in the following
terms:
<P>

<b>"13	SUPERVISION</b>
<P>

<b>13.1	INSPECTIONS BY EXCHANGE</b>
<P>

(i)	The Exchange may call upon any Participating Organisation to produce,
without delay, for inspection by the Exchange or its duly
appointed
representatives, all books or copies thereof relating to the business of the
Participating Organisation, and may also require
Affiliates, Participating
Organisations and their partners, officers, employees or securities
representatives to appear before the
Exchange or its delegates at any time, and
to give such information as may be required relating to such business or to
enable the
Exchange to consider whether or not the Affiliate or Participating
Organisation continues to comply with recognition requirements
for the purposes
of Rule 5A.1.2 or 5A.2.2."
<P>

5   	The first question is therefore in two parts.  First,
whether that Business Rule, in its contractual, constitutional and statutory
context (Pt 7.2 of the <i>Corporations Law</i>) entitles the ASX to require the
Defendant Hudson Securities Pty Limited as the Participating Organisation to
procure certain of
its directors or employees to appear before the Exchange to
provide information without there being also present an agent or representative
of Hudson Securities Pty Limited, in circumstances where Hudson Securities
insists upon that presence but refuses to give the undertaking
earlier
described.  
<P>

6   	The second, is whether the Defendant is entitled, without
recourse to any requirement of procedural fairness, not only those
it nominates
but its legal adviser present, with the corollary that ASX could not, as a
condition of that presence, insist on such
an undertaking from those present
including the legal adviser.  In each case ASX contend that the undertaking  --
and the refusal
to permit Mr McLeod to be present  --  are for the purpose of
preserving the integrity of the investigation, which must be imported
into any
requirement of procedural fairness.  The Defendant says that it does not need
to rely on procedural fairness at all for
the presence it seeks and there is no
basis for implying a term in the Business Rule about preserving the integrity
of the investigation.
<P>

7   	This question arises where information is being sought by
the ASX from Hudson Securities Pty Limited when investigating certain
share
trading effected by Hudson Securities in the shares of its listed parent,
Hudson Investment Group Limited ("HIGL").  
<P>

8   	Hudson Securities Pty Limited desires to appoint Mr McLeod,
a former employee of the Defendant at the time of the events being
investigated, and currently Managing Director of its parent with overall
responsibility for the performance of all its subsidiaries
including the
Defendant, to be present at all the relevant interviews as the representative
of Hudson Securities Pty Limited.  The
ASX wish to exclude Mr McLeod because he
is a prospective examinee and by reason of his potentially inhibiting other
examinees because
of his senior executive authority and his own potential
familiarity or involvement with the relevant events.  The ASX also wish to
exclude any other officer or employee not approved by the ASX who decline to
give such an undertaking.  
<P>

9   	The ASX contend that his presence, and the presence of
others who decline to give such an undertaking, would adversely affect
the
integrity or effectiveness of the examination.  This is for reasons which
include the risk of alerting prospective examinees
of likely questions,
premature disclosure of information at the investigator's disposal at a
formative stage of the investigation
and inhibiting frank and truthful answers
by examinees in the presence of other prospective examinees or of persons
senior to them,
and particularly if both.
<P>

10   	The Defendant contends that ASX has not satisfied the onus
of showing that it can require the Defendant to procure Mr McLeod
to present
himself for an interview under Rule 13.1.  This is because he is (relevantly)
not shown to be an employee or officer or
securities representative of Hudson
Securities at the time the investigation commenced or at any time thereafter,
though concededly
he was such an employee during some of the period in 1998
covered by the investigation, and is presently Managing Director of HIGL
with
group responsibilities.  The Defendant has offered Mr McLeod for examination
--  but without any undertaking.  That so far has
not been taken up.
<P>

11   	The answer to the foregoing question also affects the
position of the law firm of Atanaskovic Hartnell who are representing
Hudson
Securities Pty Limited.  This is because ASX on the basis of minimum procedural
fairness has no objection to the attendance
at the examination of that law firm
acting as legal representative for Hudson Securities (or indeed to the presence
of a legal representative
for an interviewee).  But ASX again requires as a
condition of that attendance an undertaking from that firm which would preclude
that firm disclosing information derived from the interviews (other than to
those persons who were personally present during the
interview for
examination).  This is until such time as the ASX advises Hudson Securities Pty
Limited that all such interviews have
been completed or ASX's Draft Inspection
Report provided to Hudson Securities for its comment, whichever is the earlier.
This is
similar to the undertaking required from any officer of the Defendant
permitted to be present at the interviews.
<P>

12   	ASX has offered that there may be present or available a
nominated representative of Hudson Securities Pty Limited to whom
Atanaskovic
Hartnell may refer for instructions. That nominated representative is however
to be approved by ASX and be someone who
has given the above undertaking (a Mr
Dunstan has been so approved).  Thus ASX has sought to require that such
person:
<P>

(a)	not be one of the persons still to be examined and thus not Mr McLeod,
and
<P>

(b)	be precluded by the above undertaking from communicating with any persons
save those present during the interview until all
such interviews had
finished.
<P>

It is submitted by ASX that the foregoing accords with the minimum procedural
fairness which ASX acknowledges must be accorded at
this investigative stage,
taking into account the need to preserve the integrity of the investigation.
<P>

13   	However, that arrangement is not acceptable to Hudson
Securities, insofar as Mr McLeod is precluded from being that person.
<P>

14   	The Defendant contends that Atanaskovic Hartnell, as well
as Mr McLeod, are entitled to be present without any such undertaking.
 This is
on the basis that ASX Rule 13.1(1) permits that representation and presence
without any such undertaking as of right  --
 in order to effectuate the
procurement by the Participating Organisation of its officers and employees to
attend and give information
 --  or at least that Rule does not preclude it.
If not precluded, it must be permitted in the absence of any implied term to
the
contrary.  It is, says the Defendant, ASX that needs to imply such a term
to Rule 13.1 to enable ASX to impose the requirement to
approve attendees and
require the confidentiality undertaking.  The Defendant contends that the
implication of such a term is not
justified by the traditional tests for
implying terms in contracts, and <i>a fortiori</i> a statutory contract such as
this.  In particular the Defendant contends that such a term is not necessary
to give business efficacy
to the Business Rules.  Nor, contends the Defendant
does it need the rules of minimum procedural fairness to enable it to be
represented
by its solicitor at such interviews;  this is contrary to the ASX's
contention that procedural fairness can be the <i>only</i> source of such a
right to legal representation and attendance.  It is therefore not to the point
(says the Defendant) for ASX to
contend that such rules of minimum procedural
fairness do not preclude the imposition of reasonable conditions designed to
protect
the integrity and effectiveness of the investigation.
<P>

15   	Hudson Securities contend that the only way in which it
can procure attendance and answers from its employees is to be present
via
whomsoever it chooses as a nominated representative.  It insists on Mr McLeod
being present as having the necessary authority
and knowledge to perform that
function.  It does so, notwithstanding ASX's concern that the integrity of the
investigation would
be thereby jeopardised.  
<P>

<b>SALIENT FACTS</b>
<P>

<b>Agreed Facts</b>
<P>

16   	What follows is an agreed statement of facts.
<P>

17   	On 12 April 1999, Mr Martin Kinsky, National Manager of
the Investigations and Enforcement Division of the ASX instructed
Mr Michael
Somes, Assistant Manager of the Investigations and Enforcement Division, to
conduct an investigation under its Business
Rules concerning the conduct of
Hudson Securities Pty Ltd ("Hudson"), a stockbroking firm, in relation to its
trading in the shares
of Hudson Investment Group Limited ("HIGL") during the
period from 23 February 1998 to 2 December 1998 ("the relevant period").
<P>

18   	Hudson is a Participating Organisation of the ASX, as that
term is defined in the ASX's Business Rules.
<P>

19   	The issued shares in Hudson were wholly owned by HIGL
during the relevant period.  
<P>

20   	During July and August 1999, in response to requests from
the ASX, Hudson provided documents to ASX relating to the subject
matter of the
investigation.
<P>

21   	By letters dated 1 September 1999 [PX1, MJS2 at 2] and 13
September 1999 [PX1, MJS2 at 4] ASX notified Hudson of the names
of various
persons who were required to appear before ASX and provide information to ASX
relating to the investigation, pursuant
to Rule 13.1(1) of the ASX Business
Rules and inquired as to the availability of other such persons to so
appear.
<P>

ASX requested confirmation that the interviewees would not discuss matters
raised during their interviews with any other persons
at Hudson.  ASX stated
that copies of tape recordings of interviews shall be provided at an
appropriate time.
<P>

22   	Those persons were:
<P>

Mr Brendan Wong 
<P>

Ms Huang
<P>

Mr Frank Dunstan 
<P>

Mr Robert Andrews 
<P>

Mr Bruce McLeod 
<P>

Mr David Hughes
<P>

Mr Glen McGrath
<P>

Mr Peter Holland
<P>

Mr John Farey
<P>

Mr David Sutton 
<P>

Mr Vincent Tan
<P>

23   	Messrs Dunstan, Andrews and Sutton are Affiliates of the
ASX (as defined in the Business Rules) and are also directors of
the Defendant.
Mr McLeod is a director of HIGL, the holding company of the Defendant and holds
shares equivalent to approximately
1.4% of the issued shares in HIGL.
<P>

24   	By letter dated 13 September 1999, ASX stated that copy
tape recordings shall be provided at an appropriate time and requested
that
Hudson inquire as to the availability of Messrs McLeod, Hughes, McGrath,
Holland, Farey, Sutton and Tan for interview over a
period covering 4 weeks.
<P>

25   	By letter dated 16 September 1999 [PX1, MJS2 at 6], Hudson
advised the ASX that Mr McLeod, Mr McGrath and Mr Holland were
not employees or
officers of Hudson and should not be included in the list of persons to be
interviewed (having regard to the wording
of Rule 13.1(1)).  The question of
whether Hudson is obliged under that Rule to make these three persons available
for interview
does not arise for determination in these proceedings.  Hudson
also advised the ASX in this letter that Mr McLeod is not involved
in trading
and settlement and was to attend as Hudson's representative as no other
appropriate persons were available.
<P>

26   	Mr McLeod testifies that although he normally does not
participate in the running of Hudson's business, for the last several
months
during the relevant period, he was responsible for running that business.
<P>

27   	Mr Dunstan attended at the ASX's offices for interview on
16 September 1999, accompanied by Hudson's solicitors, a consultant
to Hudson
named Mr Paul Tatum and Mr McLeod.  Mr Michael Somes, an Exchange Inspector
from the Investigations and Enforcement Division
of the ASX and who was
carrying out the ASX investigation, advised those present that the interview
would not be conducted in the
presence of Mr McLeod.  After some discussion, Mr
Simmons of Hudson's solicitors requested that the record show that Dunstan was
ready to be interviewed.  Mr Dunstan and those accompanying him departed
without Mr Dunstan being interviewed (see Simmons affidavit
paragraph 3(c) and
second Somes affidavit at paragraph 11).
<P>

28   	On 16 September 1999, ASX interviewed Mr Andrews in the
absence of a representative of Hudson or a legal representative.
<P>

29   	An exchange of correspondence between the ASX, Hudson and
Hudson's solicitors followed [PX1, MJS2 at 8 to 52], commencing
on 16 September
1999, in relation to whether Hudson would require Mr Dunstan, Mr Huang and Ms
Wong (whose interview times had already
been arranged) to attend for interview
without Mr McLeod being permitted to be present.
<P>

30   	By letter dated 16 September 1999 [PX1, MJS2 at 9] from
ASX to Hudson, ASX stated that it would be grateful to receive, by
close of
business on that day, Hudson's advice on whether it would comply with ASX's
request for Mr Dunstan, Mr Wong and Ms Huang
to appear for interview in the
presence of legal representatives and Mr Tatum but in the absence of Mr
Mcleod.
<P>

31   	By letter dated 16 September 1999, Atanaskovic Hartnell
stated that it was always envisaged by Hudson that a representative
of
Atanaskovic Hartnell would attend the interviews together with a representative
of the Hudson Group [MJS2 at 11].
<P>

32   	On 17 September 1999 Atanaskovic Hartnell addressed a
letter to ASX stating that although ASX was not entitled to interview
McLeod,
he would nonetheless be willing to be interviewed if he were interviewed first
and thereafter would be able to attend all
interviews as the representative of
the Hudson Group.  He would not other wise be making himself available for
interview [PX1,MSJ2
at 20].
<P>

33   	On 29 September 1999 Atanaskovic Hartnell confirmed its
request for the tapes and transcript of the Andrews interview and
stated that
Andrews was not authorised to attend or disclose confidential information.
[PX1, MSJ2 at 46].
<P>

34   	By letter dated 6 October 1999 the ASX declined to provide
tapes and transcript on the claimed basis that it was inappropriate
to do so at
that stage [PX1,MSJ2 at 48].
<P>

35   	On 13 October 1999 Atanaskovic Hartnell complained about
ASX's decision not to provide tapes and transcripts and stated that
in the
result it would bring its own tape recording device to subsequent interviews
unless there was an agreement to provide copies
of tapes and transcripts. [PX1,
MSJ2 at 51].  Atanaskovic Hartnell also stated that ASX was not entitled to
interview Mr McLeod and
that Mr McLeod would not be making himself available to
be interviewed, stating that they had previously offered to make Mr McLeod
available for interview on a particular basis which ASX had chosen to reject
[PX1, MJS2 at 52].
<P>

36   	On 22 October 1999, the ASX's solicitors wrote to Hudson's
solicitors [PX1, MJS2 at 53] asking [at 56-7] that Hudson advise
by 27 October
1999 whether Hudson would require Mr Dunstan, Mr Wong and Ms Huang (being the
three persons whose interview times had
previously been arranged [PX1, MJS2 at
4]), to appear before the ASX for interview on the basis that
<P>

(a)	Mr McLeod was not invited to attend and would not be permitted by the ASX
to attend the interviews;
<P>

(b)	legal representatives of the interviewees could be present upon providing a
confidentiality undertaking.
<P>

The letter also advised [at 57] that if Hudson was not willing to require Mr
Dunstan, Mr Wong and Ms Huang to appear before ASX
on the above basis, ASX
reserved the right to take steps to enforce Business Rule 13.1 without further
notice.
<P>

37   	Hudson's solicitors responded by letter dated 27 October
1999 [PX1, MJS2 at 58], advising [at 59-60] that Hudson agreed to
Mr McLeod not
being present at the interviews on the basis, inter alia, that 
<P>

(a)	Hudson's solicitors would attend the interviews and would have the ability
to seek instructions from Mr McLeod or any other
officer of the Hudson Group
during an interview such that if Hudson objected to a particular question they
could seek instructions
as to whether to maintain that objection and following
the interview would be able to seek instructions on other relevant matters
upon
which it might wish to re-examine the interviewee.
<P>

(b)	Hudson, Hudson's solicitors, Mr Tatum and the interviewees did not propose
giving any confidentiality undertakings.
<P>

38   	ASX's solicitors responded to this letter by letter dated
1 November 1999 [PX1, MJS2 at 61] asking [at 62] if Hudson's solicitors
would
tell ASX's solicitors that they would refrain from disclosing, until the
interview process was complete, the information imparted
during each interview
to persons who were not present at the interview.  The letter also advised [at
62] that in the absence of such
an intimation, Hudson's solicitors and the
interviewee's solicitors (if any), could be present at the interviews upon
first providing
a confidentiality undertaking.  The letter also advised that an
officer of Hudson, other than Mr McLeod, and approved by ASX, could
also be
present upon first providing a confidentiality undertaking.  The letter also
advised that Mr Paul Tatum could be present
on the same basis.  The letter also
advised that if Hudson did not confirm by 3 November 1999 that it was willing
to produce Mr Dunstan,
Mr Wong and Ms Huang for interview on this basis, the
ASX reserved the right to take steps to enforce Rule 13.1(1) without further
notice.
<P>

39   	Hudson's solicitors responded by letter dated 3 November
1999 [PX1, MJS2 at 64] advising that their position was set out in
full in
their letter dated 27 October 1999 and advised that they would not give the
confidentiality undertakings sought, on the claimed
basis that they would have
the effect of precluding Hudson's solicitors from obtaining instructions from
their client.
<P>

40   	The within proceedings were issued on 16 November 1999.
<P>

41   	By letter dated 6 December 1999 [PX3] Hudson's solicitors
nominated  Mr Dunstan as the officer of Hudson who could attend
the interviews
with ASX's approval.  By this letter, Hudson also proposed that Mr McLeod could
be included among the pool of persons,
being directors of Hudson (if Hudson was
inclined to appoint Mr McLeod as a director ) from whom an Additional Director
could be
nominated to receive information imparted during interviews and
provide instructions to Hudson's lawyers.  The letter also proposed
that
confidentiality undertakings should expire six weeks after the commencement of
remaining interviews.
<P>

42   	ASX's solicitors responded by letter dated 7 December 1999
(PX3), advising, among other matters,  that Mr McLeod was not a
person
acceptable to ASX to fulfil the role of the Additional Director as proposed,
but that it was willing to consider any other
person who might fulfil that
role.
<P>

<b>RESOLUTION OF QUESTIONS</b>
<P>

<b>Context of Business Rules</b>
<P>

43   	Does the statutory basis which underpins the Business
Rules and addresses the public functions of the Stock Exchange have
any
implications for whether the Business Rules are to be construed purposively?
Clearly the Rules are not themselves statutory,
so as to be subject to the
purposive interpretation application to provisions of the <i>Corporations
Law</i>, by s109H.  Nonetheless, must the Rules be construed as subject to an
overriding requirement that they should operate so as not to
prejudice the
integrity of the investigation?
<P>

44   	It could not be controverted that the Business Rules find
constitutional support in the constitution of ASX, which is essentially
its
articles of association.  In that sense the rules start as self-regulation.
Article 13.1 of that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> mandates the making and promulgation of such
rules for, inter alia, "the maintenance and operation of markets and facilities
operated
by the Company".  Then Article 13.2 mandates their content in
purposive terms which parallels much of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p7.2" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 7.2</a> of the <i>Corporations Law</i>,
so providing a primary source for their interpretation.  Article 13.2
provides:

"Mandatory content

13.2	Notwithstanding any other provision, the business rules made and
promulgated by the Company must:
<P>

(a)	set standards of training and experience and educational qualifications to
be possessed by persons administering the activities
of any corporation or
partnership granted admission as a participating organisation;
<P>

(b)	provide for exclusion from the position of participating organisation
of:
<P>

(i)	any organisation where a director or a person concerned in management or
having control or substantial control of the organisation
is not of good
character and high integrity;  and
<P>

(ii)	any person who is not of good character and high business integrity;
and
<P>

(c)	provide for the expulsion, suspension or disciplining of a participating
organisation for conduct inconsistent with just and
equitable principles in the
transaction of business or for a contravention of the Company's business rules,
of a provision of Chapter
7 of the Corporations Law or of the conditions of a
licence granted under the Corporations Law;
<P>

(d)	provide for the monitoring of compliance with, and the enforcement of the
Company's business rules;
<P>

(e)	contain provisions calculated to ensure that dealings in securities by
participating organisations are engaged in on a basis
that is efficient and
honest;
<P>

(f)	contain provisions calculated to ensure that the activities of
participating organisations as such are consistent with the interest
of the
public;
<P>

(g)	otherwise define the rights, privileges, duties and obligations of
participating organisations;
<P>

(h)	prescribe (or provide for the prescription of) rules, regulations,
practices and procedures by reference to which participating
organisations are
to deal in securities;
<P>

.....
<P>

(j)	provide for the expulsion, suspension or disciplining of an affiliate for
breach of obligations or conduct likely to bring into
disrepute the profession
of stockbroking;  and
<P>

(k)	to the extent that they contain provisions conferring powers of the kind
referred to in Article 13.7, require that those powers
be exercised in the
manner stated in that article."
<P>

45   	I quote Article 13.7 below:
<P>

"Exercise of powers
<P>

13.7	Powers conferred upon the Company by the business rules in respect of
participating organisations and affiliates (and, in particular,
admission,
exclusion, expulsion, suspension and disciplining) must be exercised:
<P>

(a)	fairly and impartially;
<P>

(b)	in the interests of the public;  and
<P>

(c)	with due regard for principles of natural justice."
<P>

Clearly the investigative power is required to be exercised in accordance with
all three requirements.  There is no suggestion that
"the interests of the
public" are to be subordinated to procedural fairness as embodied in "due
regard for principles of natural
justice".
<P>

46   	These ASX Constitutional provisions and the Business Rules
flowing from them are underpinned by Pt 7.2 of the <i>Corporations Law</i>.
The <i>Corporations Law</i> provides a statutory source for their
interpretation, reinforcing the paramount public and regulatory purpose to be
served by the
Business Rules.  Thus there is s769A titled "ongoing requirements
to be observed by securities exchange", s770 providing for Ministerial
approval
of such business rules if satisfied they make satisfactory provision for the
matters specified, s772A giving the business
rules contractual force as a
statutory contract between ASX and member and s777 rendering the business rules
enforceable not only
by the deemed contracting parties but also ASIC and any
"person aggrieved by the failure" to "comply with or enforce the business
rules".  I later elaborate on these statutory provisions.  It suffices to
emphasise that the ASX Business Rules are both called for
by the legislative
scheme and are underpinned by it.
<P>

47   	What then is the impact on the integrity of the
investigation of the absence of the earlier mentioned undertakings and/or
Mr
McLeod's presence at interviews or other involvement?  And what implication
does that have under the Business Rules?
<P>

48   	I am satisfied that absence of such undertakings and the
unrestricted presence of Mr McLeod (see below) would prejudice the
integrity of
the investigation.  This is in the sense of undermining the capacity of such
investigation to fulfil the evident public
purpose of the business rules as set
forth in Article 13.2 of the ASX <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> and in particular paras (c), (d),
(e), (f), (j) and (k) as well as Article 13.7(b) and reinforced by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p7.2" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 7.2</a> of
the <i>Corporations Law</i>.  This is because those undertakings are the only
means of preventing a person, being either the legal representative of the
Defendant
or an interviewee, or an officer of the Defendant or its parent
company, from disclosing to others still to be examined the kind
of questions
likely to be asked from the answers given by others so putting at risk the
effectiveness of the investigation.  
<P>

49   	Such indeed was assumed by the Full Federal Court, albeit
in the context of an ASIC examination under ASIC Law where there
is an express
statutory code <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">(ss19</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">22</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">23</a> of ASIC Law);  <i>Australian Securities
Commission v Bell</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1991/565.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] FCA 565</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%206%20ACSR%20281" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 6 ACSR 281.</a>  It was not there doubted that an
inspector may, as a condition of permitting a lawyer to be present, give the
lawyer a similar direction
as to confidentiality.  Furthermore, it has more
recently been accepted that an inspector may exclude a particular lawyer
pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s22(1)</a> of ASIC Law where there are reasonable grounds for a bona
fide belief by the inspector that the presence of a lawyer will or is likely
to
prejudice the investigation of which the examination is part.  That the
correctness of that decision may be challenged in the
courts, where the onus
will lie on the inspector to show that there were reasonable grounds for the
decision, does not detract from
that underlying premise;  see <i>ASC v Bell</i>
(supra) approved in <i>Macquarie Advisory Group Pty Ltd (Receiver appointed)
&amp; Ors v Australian Securities and Investments Commission</i> (1999) 33 ACSR
106 at 108, para 6.  
<P>

50   	For reasons developed below, I do not consider that the
absence of a statutory code of the particularity applicable to ASIC
investigations alters the application of a similar approach to ASX
investigations.  This is because the Business Rules in their constitutional
and
statutory context have enlisted self-regulation for a public purpose.  They are
directed inter alia to providing "adequate arrangements
for monitoring and
enforcing compliance" with those Business Rules (s769A(1)(b);  directed to
ensure that each stock market of the
exchange is an orderly and fair market"
(s769A(1)(a)).  The investigations provided by Rule 13.1(1) would cease to be
adequate arrangements
serving the statutory purpose if their integrity were
undermined either by being procedurally unfair or by being ineffective and
procedural fairness can accommodate reasonable requirements for
confidentiality.
<P>

51   	It is self-evident that the integrity of the investigation
would be at risk absent the undertaking for confidentiality sought
by ASX, or
if there were unrestricted attendance at the interviews.
<P>

52   	That leads me to the position of Mr McLeod.  The
Defendants contend that ASX have not as yet established definitively that
Mr
McLeod is a partner, officer, employee or securities representative of the
Defendant as a "Participating Organisation".  The ASX
have sought to have that
issue dealt with if necessary in future proceedings.  Clearly he is not caught
as an "affiliate".  Rule
5A requires that Mr McLeod must first have applied to
be recognised as an affiliate in accordance with the relevant rule and there
is
no evidence that he has done so.  However, they have sufficiently demonstrated
that there is a real possibility that Mr McLeod
is a shadow director of the
Defendant insofar as he is managing director of the parent, was until
relatively recently a director
of the Defendant and while playing no active
role in its management is clearly the senior executive for the group, to whom
other
executives would ordinarily be answerable.  Specially significant is that
he has admitted his position "enables me to ensure that
the persons attending
interviews provide such information as they are called upon to furnish" (see Mr
McLeod's affidavit 29 November
1999 paras 8 to 12 and in particular para
17(b)).
<P>

53   	Australian Corporations Law Principles and Practice
(Butterworths), Vol. 1 at 3.2.0005 conveniently describes the basis for
identifying a shadow director:
<P>

"he concept of a `shadow director", or person in accordance with whose
directions or instructions the directors of a body corporate
are accustomed to
act might include, for example, the chairman of the board or chief executive of
a holding company, if the directors
of a subsidiary typically acted in
accordance with that person's directions.  It appears that a person will only
fall within this
limb of the definition of director if all of the directors of
the body corporate are accustomed to act in accordance with that person's
directions or instructions.  In <i>Australian Securities Commission v AS
Nominees Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1995/1663.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] FCA 1663</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2062%20FCR%20504" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 62 FCR 504</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=133%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">133 ALR 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=18%20ACSR%20459" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">18 ACSR 459</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=13%20ACLC%201822" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">13 ACLC 1822</a>, the
Federal Court (Finn J) held that, where the directors of a trustee company were
accustomed to act in accordance with the directions
of a particular person,
that person was a shadow director, although it could not be said that his
influence extended to all board
decisions or that the board did not exercise
any independent discretion.  Finn J observed that the reference in CL s60, to a
person
in accordance with whose directions or instructions and directors are
"accustomed to act", did not require that there be directions
or instructions
embracing all matters involving the board.  Rather, it only required that, as
and when the directors are instructed,
they are accustomed to act as the
section required.  His Honour noted that it was not necessary that a person
give formal directions
or instructions in matters in which he or she involved
himself, since compliance with what was sought could be obtained by other
means;  and that the idea of CL s60 is that "the third party calls the tune and
the directors dance in their capacity as directors
...  The question the
section poses is:  Where, for some or all purposes, is the locus of effective
decision making?"  (ACSR at 509-10;
 ACLC at 1838)."
<P>

54   	It is clear that Mr McLeod could come within these indicia
of a shadow director. Mr McLeod was an employee at the time of
the events in
1998 giving rise to the investigation for some months thereof.  But that of
itself does not satisfy Rule 13.1(1) as
it is clear that the Participating
Organisation is the only party who can be made subject to the obligations there
imposed.  From
that it necessarily follows that the reference to partners,
officers, employees, etc. must refer to those who are such at the time
of the
investigation, not some previous time.  Otherwise, it would not be possible to
give efficacy to the implied requirement or
correlative obligation that the
Participating Organisation procures its officers or employees, etc. to appear
before the ASX or its
delegate.
<P>

55   	While it is true that Mr McLeod is a director of the
Participating Organisation's parent, it is not contended by the ASX that
it is
a Participating Organisation.
<P>

56   	But whether shadow director or not, I am satisfied that Mr
McLeod, as a person who was an employee at the time of the relevant
events, may
have been involved in them and occupying the position as managing director of
the parent with overall authority for the
group could, by his presence
alongside the interviewees, inhibit or affect their answers.  And it is simply
nonsense to say that
those employees would not answer questions <i>unless</i>
he were present.  The opposite is more likely true.  Are those circumstances
sufficient for a conclusion to be drawn that to permit
him to be present would
affect the integrity of the investigation?  In my judgment that does suffice.
In saying that, I wish to be
clear that I make no criticism of Mr McLeod or
aspersions upon his integrity.  What I do conclude is that there is sufficient
risk
that the investigation could be adversely affected that I would conclude
that his presence would affect its integrity in the sense
of prejudicing its
efficacy and reliability for the public purpose it is intended to serve.
<P>

57   	That leaves however the question, would the integrity of
the investigation be adversely affected if Mr McLeod were not present
at
interviews, possibly but not necessarily given a copy of the transcript but in
any event enabled to give instructions to the legal
representative of the
Defendant?  What follows proceeds on the assumption that in those circumstances
ASX is entitled to do what
is necessary  --  but no more  --  to preserve the
integrity of the investigation.  I will return later to the basis for that
assumption.
<P>

58   	There are several things to weigh up, in considering on
the one hand minimum procedural fairness and on the other possible
prejudice to
the investigation.  Thus Atanaskovic Hartnell necessarily need to be able,
contemporaneously with the interviews and
not merely thereafter, to investigate
for itself the events that happened.  It is clear that Mr McLeod would be
someone who could
potentially provide material information to Atanaskovic
Hartnell, but he need not be the principal source of instructions.  The
questioning
of Mr McLeod should not require handing over the transcript.  But
the problem is that in the course of such questioning, it may well
be clear
what kind of questions were asked by the ASX or its representative of the other
examinees as well as revealing the answers
so far received to Mr McLeod.
Provided Mr McLeod is not given the transcripts and gives an undertaking not to
communicate with any
of those persons who are yet to be the subject of
investigation but who have been identified as likely to be interviewed and
amenable
to Rule 13.1 via the Defendant, the risk to the integrity of the
investigation is reduced.  But it is in my judgment, not sufficiently
removed.
<P>

59   	It might have been that Mr McLeod could first have been
interviewed before any such instruction were given.  But ASX say that
their
investigation requires a different order of questioning and that ASX may in any
event need to ask Mr McLeod further questions
at the end.  If it is still
seriously disputed as to whether Mr McLeod is a shadow director, I could give
leave to proceedings to
determine definitively whether or not he is an officer
of the Defendant so that the matter could be finally resolved as to his
amenability
to being required by the Defendant to answer.  On the present state
of the evidence, there are strong indications that he might be,
but it would be
unsafe to express a final view on that aspect at this point.  This could be
before Mr McLeod were spoken to about
the interviews by the solicitors.
<P>

60   	The foregoing is in answer to the question, what steps
would need to be taken, so far as Mr McLeod is concerned, to preserve
the
integrity of the investigation on the assumption ASX were entitled to do what
was necessary in that regard.  But does ASX have
power under Rule 13.1(1) to
insist on preservation of the integrity of the investigation?  It is to that
question I now turn.
<P>

61   	The particular matter of interpretation which is at the
heart of the present case is this.  Does the Defendant depend upon
an implied
term conferring minimal procedural fairness (aided by Cl 13.7 of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>) to be added to Rule 13.1(1) in order to have legal representation
at the interviews and to have present or available for instructions
other
persons than those being interviewed?  If so, is that  implied term itself
qualified by the requirement that the content of
that minimum procedural
fairness must be such as does not prejudice the integrity of the investigation?
Or instead does ASX require
an implied term to be empowered  to preserve the
integrity of the investigation by insisting on the relevant undertakings and
the
right to approve who else is present at the interviews? 
<P>

62   	The Defendant's contention is that Rule 13.1(1) is silent
as to any preclusion of other persons being present at the interview.
 It is
silent likewise as to preclusion of a legal adviser being present.  Because the
obligation is imposed on the Participating
Organisation it is contended that
Rule 13.1(1) could have not efficacy unless the Participating Organisation were
able to be present
via whomsoever it nominates as its agent in order to ensure
that its employees or officers do respond to the questions asked.
<P>

63   	The Defendant has been at pains to avoid relying upon an
implied term of procedural fairness in contending for an unqualified
right to
have a legal adviser present or other persons present.  However, it has not
rejected that implied term as an alternative
source of this right, contending
rather that it does not need it.
<P>

64   	The ASX, for its part, contends that Rule 13.1(1) simply
requires that the Participating Organisation procures the relevant
officers or
employees, etc. to give such information as may be required and attend
interviews for that purpose.  But Rule 13.1(1)
does not thereby require the
Participating Organisation to be present through its nominated agent, whether
for the purpose of procuring
officer or employee answers or otherwise.  In my
view, Rule 13.1(1) does not, as a matter of its proper interpretation,
<i>require</i> such presence.  Rather it <i>permits</i> such presence.  But
this is only to the extent procedural fairness requires it and then only to the
extent the integrity of the investigation
is not thereby prejudiced.  I expand
on the basis for that conclusion below.
<P>

<b>An Historical Perspective</b>
<P>

65   	First that conclusion derives from the contractual,
constitutional and statutory context of Rule 13.1(1).  I have already
referred
to the constitutional context, with brief reference to statute.  Some
elaboration is necessary starting with an historical
perspective of the process
whereby the stock exchanges evolved from self-regulation as a private club to
what may be described as
"controlled self-regulation", or self-regulation
enlisted for a public purpose.  That evolution is described in the earlier
edition
of "An Introduction to the Securities Industry Codes (Butterworths,
1982) at 68 by Baxt, Ford, Samuels and Maxwell in these terms:
<P>

"At one time the stock exchanges were entirely private markets unregulated by
any public legislation.  The management of each stock
exchange owed no legal
duty to the public and the business of the exchange was subject only to those
regulations which the members
of the stock exchange thought right to impose on
themselves.  Anybody was free to start new stock exchanges.
<P>

The complexity of stock markets provides such opportunities for sharp practice
that the conducting of them calls for a measure of
control in the public
interest.  The extent of governmental control can vary.  The volume of
potential business may be so great that
there should be comparative freedom of
entry to organisations seeking to enter upon the activity of conducting a stock
market.  In
the absence of competing stock markets the range of matters of
internal management in a stock exchange which may be controlled may
be wider
than is the case where stock markets compete.  In Australia the pattern of
control of stock exchange and stock markets is
best described as controlled
self-regulation.
<P>

The enactment of the uniform securities industry legislation in 1975 confirmed
the approach adopted in the securities industry legislation
introduced in New
South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia in 1970/1971 which
subjected the organisation and management
of stock exchanges to a measure of
governmental control.  That approach has been maintained in the
Commonwealth/State co-operative
legislation.  Stock exchanges are under a
statutory duty to assist the NCSC:  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">s41(1).</a>  They must allow access to their
trading floors to any person authorised by the NCSC:  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">s41(3).</a>  The NCSC can
prohibit trading in particular securities: <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s40.html" class="autolink_findacts">s40.</a>
<P>

Then describing the position as of 1975, we have the basis for that control
over self-regulation which now finds its counterpart
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p7.2" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 7.2</a> of the
<i>Corporations Law</i>.  As of 1975 it was described as follows (at 69-70):
<P>

"Before a body corporate may be approved by the Ministerial council as a new
stock exchange, the Council must be satisfied (i) 
as to its business rules
governing its activities, the activities of its members and the activities of
other persons in relation
to the exchange's stock market;  (ii)  as to its
listing rules governing the bodies or persons admitted to the exchange's list
for
the purpose of securities issued by them being quoted by the exchange;  and
(iii)  that the interests of the public will be served
by the granting of the
approval:  SIA <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s38(2).</a>
<P>

.....
<P>

To be acceptable to the Ministerial Council the business rules must make
satisfactory provision for various matters.  The business
rules must
provide:
<P>

(i)	for the exclusion from membership of persons who are not of good character
and high business integrity;
<P>

(ii)	for the expulsion, suspension or disciplining of members for conduct
inconsistent with just and equitable principles in the
transaction of business
or for a contravention of or failure to comply with the business rules of the
proposed stock exchange or
the provisions of the Act;
<P>

(iii)	with respect to the conditions under which securities may be listed for
trading in the stock market of the proposed stock
exchange;
<P>

(iv)	with respect to the conditions governing dealings in securities by
members;
<P>

(v)	with respect to the class or classes of securities that may be dealt with
by members;  and
<P>

(vi)	generally for the carrying on of the business of the proposed stock
exchange with due regard to the interests of the public:
 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s38(2)."</a>
<P>

66   	Section 772A of the <i>Corporations Law</i> in its latest
form was inserted in the Law in 1997, in anticipation of the demutualisation of
ASX, which occurred in October 1998.
 The Stock Exchange had earlier been
incorporated as Australian Stock Exchange Ltd in 1987;  see "Securities
Industry Law" (Butterworths)
by Baxt, Ford and Black at para 502, p 139 for
elaboration of that history.  It is by s772A of the <i>Corporations Law</i>
introduced in 1997 that the current Business Rules of the ASX 
<P>

"have effect, by force of this section as a contract under seal:
<P>

(a)	between the Exchange and each member;  and
<P>

(b)	between a member and each other member;
<P>

under which each of those persons agree to observe and perform the provisions
of the Business Rules as in force for the time being,
so far as those
provisions are applicable to that person."
<P>

67   	The commentary to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/clab1997336/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporations Law Amendment (ASX)
Bill 1997</a>, noted:
<P>

"47.	By virtue of section 180 of the Corporations Law, presently the business
rules of a securities exchange have the legal effect
of a contract under seal
between the exchange and its members ...
<P>

On the commencement of this Bill, stockbrokers will not be required to be
members of a securities exchange in the traditional company
law sense
contemplated by the term `member' in section 180 ...
<P>

48.	Proposed section 772A will address this situation by providing that the
business rules of a securities exchange have effect
as a contract under seal
between the exchange and each member and between a member and each other
member."
<P>

68   	Thus "member" is defined by s9 of the <i>Corporations
Law</i> which since the 1997 amendments includes: 
<P>

"(i)	a person who is a member organisation of that Exchange [meaning Securities
Exchange or Stock Exchange];  or
<P>

(ii)	a person who is a partner in a partnership that is a member organisation
of that Exchange;  or
<P>

(iii)	a person who is recognised under the Business Rules of the Exchange as a
suitably qualified affiliate of the Exchange and
who is involved in the
carrying on of the business dealing in securities (where there is an employee,
director or in any other capacity);
<P>

.... "
<P>

69   	Prior to s772A the same legal result was achieved more
generally for any company by virtue of s180 of the <i>Corporations Law</i>.  It
thus applied to the then business rules as incorporated in the Articles of
Association of ASX Limited.  So Business Rule 13.1
found its counterpart in
Article 57.  Section 180(1) of the pre-1997 <i>Corporations Law</i> provided
that:
<P>

"Subject to this Law, the constitution of a company has the effect of a
contract under seal:
<P>

(a)	between the company and each member;
<P>

(b)	between the company and each eligible officer;  and
<P>

(c)	between a member and each other member;
<P>

under which each of the abovementioned persons agrees to observe and perform
provisions of the constitution as in force at the time
being so far as those
provisions are applicable to that person."
<P>

<b>Elaboration of Current Statutory Provisions of Pt 7.2</b>
<P>

70   	Section 772A is a provision to similar effect, but
specifically applicable to a "securities exchange".  It appears in Pt 7.2
of
the <i>Corporations Law</i> alongside linked statutory provisions applicable to
Stock Markets and a Stock Exchange, in particular the ASX.  That serves to
emphasise
the connection between the deemed contractual status of the Business
Rules and the statutory purposes which they serve.  That purpose
transcends the
private purposes of the Stock Exchange and its "Participating
Organisations".
<P>

71   	Business Rule 5.2.4(1) provides that:
<P>

"A Participating Organisation shall, when requested so to do by the Exchange
exercise the powers it has under the provisions required
by Rule 5A 2.1(2)(d)
to obtain appropriate information from its members."
<P>

72   	Business Rule 5A 2.1(2)(d) provides that the Exchange
shall recognise a company as a Participating Organisation if the Exchange
is
satisfied as to various matters including:
<P>

"... 
<P>

(d)	.... that the constitution of the applicant contains provisions which
require continued compliance by the applicant for the
requirements of these
Rules, and contain provisions authorising the applicant, on its own initiative
or at the request of the Exchange,
to obtain from its members any information
which could be obtained if Pt 6.8 of the Corporations Law, applied to the
applicant."
<P>

73   	While the expression "members" is not defined directly by
the Business Rules, under "interpretation" at the commencement thereof,
para 1
provides:
<P>

"Division 10 of Pt 1.2 of the Corporations Law applies in relation to these
Rules as if they were an instrument under the Law."
<P>

74   	Division 10 of Pt 1.2 of the <i>Corporations Law</i>
imports s9 and in particular the definition of "member" earlier quoted.  Thus
it follows from Rule 5.2.4(1) that a Participating
Company must obtain any
"appropriate information" requested by the Exchange from its members in that
statutory sense of member. 
But "member" may include members in the ordinary
sense of a shareholder in the Participating Organisation.  If so, it would
follow
that the Defendant would be obliged to obtain that information from its
parent company HIGL, though the conclusions I have reached
do not depend on
that interpretation.  While also there is no express provision deeming "member"
to include "an employee, director,
or in any other capacity", in contrast to
that extended definition applying to an affiliate recognised as such in the
Business Rules
of the Exchange, nonetheless by necessary implication from Rule
13.1(1) itself it must be the case that a Participating Organisation
is obliged
to cause officers or employees to provide the relevant information.  
<P>

75   	I have earlier referred to the legislative history of
s772A with its general predecessor s180, which in turn had its equivalent
in
s78 of the <i>Companies Code</i> and which in turn replaced s33 of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ca1961107/" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Act</i> 1961</a>.  I pointed out that s772A has been inserted in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ca1961107/index.html#p7.2" class="autolink_findacts">Pt
7.2</a> making even more explicit the linkage between it and its related provisions
underpinning ASX Business Rules.  It is to those related
provisions that I now
turn, in order to flesh out the statutory context for the deemed contract
constituted by the Business Rules.
<P>

76   	Section 769A(1) of the <i>Corporations Law</i> repeats
that 
<P>

"A securities exchange must:
<P>

...
<P>

(b)	have adequate arrangements for monitoring and enforcing compliance with its
business rules and listing rules;  and
<P>

(c)	have adequate arrangements for the expulsion, suspension or disciplining of
a member for conduct inconsistent with just and
equitable principles in the
transaction of business or for a contravention of:
<P>

(i)	the Exchange's Business Rules;  or
<P>

(ii)	this Chapter;  or
<P>

(iii)	the conditions of a licence held by the members;  and
<P>

...
<P>

(e)	have adequate arrangements for investigating complaints by investors
relating to the transaction of the business of investors
on a stock market of
the Exchange."
<P>

77   	That provision is reinforced by s770 which provides for
Ministerial approval of a securities organisation for it to be "an
approved
securities organisation".  Amongst the Minister's criteria for approval are
requirements that the body's Business Rules
make satisfactory provision "for
the monitoring of compliance with, and for enforcement of, the body's Business
Rules" (see s770(2)(b)(iii)).
<P>

78   	Furthermore, s770(2)(d)(ii) requires that the Listing
Rules made or adopted make satisfactory provision "generally for the
protection
of the interests of the public".
<P>

79   	Then s774 makes it obligatory for the Minister to approve
any alteration to the Business Rules with notification also to ASIC.
<P>

80   	Section 776 requires securities exchanges including the
ASX to provide assistance to ASIC including notification where it
believes that
a serious contravention, inter alia, of the Exchange's Business Rules has been
committed.
<P>

81   	Finally, s777(1) on the application of ASIC, the
securities exchange, or a person aggrieved by the failure, empowers the court
to make an order giving directions concerning compliance with or enforcement of
the Business Rules,  This is "where a person who
is under an obligation to
comply with or enforce the Business Rules ... of a securities exchange fails to
comply with or enforce
any of those business rules...".
<P>

82   	As the Laws of Australia point out in contending that
judicial review applies to breaches of the business or listing rules
at para
176:
<P>

"The question of the availability of such remedies is a developing area of law,
and depends on whether there is a public element
present in the exercise of
contractual powers.  The matter has to be resolved at common law, there being
no statutory provision for
review by a court or other public authority.  The
matter turns on whether or not the decision in question can be characterised as
not simply one of a private or domestic nature, rooted in contractual
relations, but rather the discharge of a public duty, affecting
more than those
bound by contract to observe the rules.
<P>

On the basis of the public importance of the national stock market, and the
statutory context to its position, it is strongly arguable
that disciplinary
decisions of the ASX at least are subject to judicial review.  The argument
derives further support from the statutory
requirement for a securities
exchange which has taken disciplinary action against a member or, has formed a
belief that a serious
contravention of the Business or Listing Rules or of the
<i>Corporations Law</i> has been or is being committed, to file particulars
with the ASC under <i>Corporations Law</i>, s776.8
<P>

8	See <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/clrb1993235/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporate Law Reform Bill 1993</a> (Cth),  Explanatory Memorandum, paras
209-211.  See also <i>Corporations Law</i>, s862.  See also the view (without
further elaboration) of Young J in <i>Fire &amp; All Risks Insurance Co Ltd
</i> <i>v Pioneer Concrete Services Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2010%20ACLR%20760" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 10 ACLR 760 (SC</a> NSW) that
the Court had jurisdiction to correct an error of law leading to a de-listing.
See also Ford HAJ and Austin RP, Ford's
Principles of Corporations Law (6 ed,
Sydney:  Butt, 1992), 896.
<P>

83   	That affirms the establishment of a public dimension to
what were once the rules of a private "club".  For the clearest indication
of
their public character is that they are enforceable not merely as a private
contract, but by any third party aggrieved, and the
Exchange itself may be
called to account for inadequacies in its rules or their enforcement.
<P>

<b>Application of Rule 13.1(1)</b>
<P>

84   	That statutory context is a vital part of the factual
matrix under which the Business Rules operate.  It bears directly upon
their
interpretation.  In particular, an interpretation of Rule 13.1(1) which
permitted the integrity of the Exchange's investigations
to be prejudiced would
subvert the public purpose of that investigation as identified by s769A(1)(a)
and (b).  That in turn may lead
to intervention in the Exchange's affairs by
ASIC and the Minister under the relevant statutory powers in Pt 7.2.  Such an
interpretation
is  manifestly absurd.  For it would assume a Business Rule
designed to fail in the very purpose of its existence with serious consequences
for its promulgator, ASX.  
<P>

85   	This point is reinforced when Rule 13.1 is viewed in its
overall contractual context of the Business Rules as a whole with
their
constitutional base.  Rule 13.1 and its predecessor, Article 57, requires
information "relating to such business" of the relevant
Participating
Organisation, or, "to enable the Exchange to consider whether or not the
Affiliate or the Participating Organisation
continues to comply with
recognition requirements for the purposes of Rule 5A 1.2 or 5A 2.2."  We are
here concerned with the first
of these.
<P>

86   	The investigative phase appears under the heading
"Supervision" and is the prelude, if warranted, to action against the
Participating
Organisation (Rule 13.3.2).  Furthermore, Rule 13.5 provides for
disciplinary action in relation to breaches of the Rules or prohibited
conduct.
A serious case can involve cancellation of recognition.  Appeal rights to the
Appeal Tribunal are set out in Rule 13.7.
 A record of disciplinary action is
required by Rule 13.9.
<P>

87   	In MJS2-53 the solicitors for the ASX write to Atanaskovic
Hartnell on 22 October 1999 as to how they conduct investigations
and the view
that was formed concerning Mr McLeod.  I quote the relevant paragraphs
below:
<P>

"In conducting investigations concerning the conduct of Participating
Organisations for the purpose of monitoring and enforcing
compliance with the
Business Rules, consistent with its obligations under the Corporations Law (see
s769A), ASX strives to act fairly,
and strives to be seen to be acting fairly.
It also strives, through the work undertaken by its Exchange Inspectors, to
gather all
relevant evidence relating to the particular matter under
investigation, which the Exchange Inspector customarily collates in the
form of
a Draft Inspection Report ("DIR").  The DIR has annexed to it transcripts of
relevant interviews conducted under Business
Rule 13.1 together with any other
documents relevant to the investigation.  The DIR (including the transcripts of
interview) is provided
to the Participating Organisation for its comment, and
any comments received are considered by the Exchange Inspector in finalising
the DIR as a Final Inspection Report ("FIR").  The FIR is then considered by
members of ASX's senior management and decision is taken
on whether to charge
the Participating Organisation with a breach of the Business Rules pursuant to
Business Rule 13.5.1.  If charges
are laid, a hearing is held before ASX's
National Adjudicatory Tribunal, at which the Participating Organisation has an
entitlement
to be heard and an entitlement to legal representation.
<P>

In the present matter, the Exchange Inspector Mr Somes has formed a view in
good faith that for reasons which include maintaining
the integrity of the
investigation, it would be inappropriate for Mr McLeod to be present during the
interviews.  That stance does
not, in ASX's view, prejudice the interests of
the interviewees or Hudson or give rise to any unfairness.  The interviewees'
interests
may be protected by their legal representatives, who will be
permitted to re-examine the interviewees before the Exchange Inspector
to draw
out any additional information which might otherwise be overlooked.  Hudson
will in due course obtain access to the transcripts
of interview and may make
submissions regarding their contents to the Exchange Inspector before the DIR
is finalised.
<P>

We are instructed that Mr Somes' view regarding the inappropriateness of Mr
McLeod attending the interviews, would not be different
merely by reason of Mr
McLeod's offer to submit to an interview prior to the interviews of Mr Dunstan,
Mr Wong and Ms Huang.  Mr
Somes wishes to interview Mr Dunstan, Mr Wong and Ms
Huang before any interview of Mr McLeod.  But even if Mr McLeod was interviewed
first, Mr Somes considers in good faith that it would be inappropriate for Mr
McLeod to be present during the subsequent interviews.
<P>

ASX Business Rules do not contain a provision entitling Participating
Organisations to have an additional officer or other representative
present
when an officer, employee or securities representative appears before an ASX
delegate pursuant to Rule 13.1.  Although ASX
does not consider that Hudson has
an entitlement, under the Business Rules or otherwise, to have an officer of
Hudson, (other than
the interviewee) present at the interviews, we are
instructed that the Exchange Inspector, at his discretion, is willing to
consider
permitting such an officer (but not Mr McLeod) to be present.  Hudson
would need to submit the name of that officer to ASX for consideration
by the
Exchange Inspector."
<P>

88   	The last three paragraphs quoted indicate the position
that ASX has taken.  The question is whether it is justified by Rule
13.1(1)
either by its express terms or by way of an implied term.  In so interpreting
Rule 13.1 I have already indicated that it
must be interpreted by reference to
its public purpose.
<P>

89   	In concluding that the Participating Organisation need not
be present by a nominated person at the time of any interview of
an employee or
officer, it is true that Rule 13.1(1) does not in express terms either permit
or preclude such presence.  Moreover
there is no express provision that the
hearing is private with its implication in that regard  --  compare s36(2) of
the <i>ASIC Act</i> dealt with in <i>National Companies and Securities
Commission v Bankers Trust Australia Ltd &amp; Ors</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1989/530.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] FCA 530</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2024%20FCR%20217" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 24 FCR 217 (Full</a>
Federal Court).  However, I am satisfied that the proper interpretation of the
provision is that the Participating Organisation is
merely required to procure
the presence of an officer or employee at interview and that procurement
certainly does not require the
Participating Organisation otherwise to be
present.  Furthermore, I am satisfied that if a Participating Organisation were
to have
the right to have present a representative of that Participating
Organisation whose presence could adversely affect the integrity
of the
investigation, such as where a person were nominated who was himself or herself
likely to be examined, or who was not prepared
to give an undertaking of
confidentiality in relation to passing on information from the interview to
persons who were likely to
be examined, that would destroy the integrity of the
investigation.  I consider that the silence of Rule 13.1(1) as to any right
on
the Participating Organisation's part to be present means that no such right
exists, save as implied by rules of minimal procedural
fairness and subject to
those rules accommodating the requirement of not prejudicing the integrity of
the investigation for its public
purpose.  That then represents an implied term
to Rule 13.1(1), whether or not it needs to qualify Rule 13.1(1) or simply to
expand
it. 
<P>

90   	Thus I consider that where the integrity of the
investigation is affected, minimal rules of procedural fairness would not
require such presence, save where appropriate undertakings could be given which
removed any material risk to the integrity of the
investigation.  Thus in
<i>NCSC v News Corporation Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 29</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20156%20CLR%20296" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 156 CLR 296</a> (at 316) the High Court
held it was not unfair for the NCSC to exclude News (the subject of NCSC's
investigation) and its lawyer
from inquisitorial hearings, having regard to the
legitimate concern that a hearing may be frustrated if all the information at
the
investigator's disposal is prematurely disclosed.  I also here adopt what
was said by Bryson J in <i>Shaw Stockbroking v Australian Stock Exchange
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2026%20ACSR%20702" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 26 ACSR 702</a> at 719 (approved by the South Australian Full Court
in <i>McLachlan v Australian Stock Exchange &amp; Anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2030%20ASCR%2026" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 30 ASCR 26)</a>
when he dealt with subdelegation under Article 57:
<P>

"The proceedings under art 57 took place in a procedural framework formed by
the business rules, the articles and by practice in
which the determinations of
an examining inspector and the preparation of a draft report and a final report
can be clearly recognised
as an investigative stage.  There is a collection of
information and consideration of its effect, but there is not a determination
of any facts or of what the consequences of the facts are to be;  the
proceedings lay the ground for consideration whether charges
are to be made.
If charges are made other procedural arrangements clearly recognisable as a
determinative stage begin.  Those procedures
can lead to determination of facts
and the imposition of penalties and other adverse consequences.  What is
required as a matter
of procedure to achieve fairness is quite different for
these two stages.
<P>

.....
<P>

There are detailed prescriptions for securing  procedural justice at a later
stage and their existence is a large factor against
judicialising the
investigative stage to any extent.  Article 57 shows that a right of ASX to
require information is an established
feature of the relationship between ASX
and its members.  Concepts of procedural justice must be accommodated to
this.
<P>

.....
<P>

Shaw's counsel referred me to several judicial statements dealing with the
nature and variable content of procedural fairness: 
<i>O'Rourke v Miller</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20156%20CLR%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 156 CLR 342</a> at 352-3;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=58%20ALR%20269" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">58 ALR 269 (Gibbs</a> CJ), <i>Salemi v MacKellar (No
2)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%20137%20CLR%20396" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 137 CLR 396</a> at 444-5;  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=14%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">14 ALR 1 (Stephen</a> J).  These observations
are directed to the determinative stage of proceedings.  The investigative
stage is not entirely separate
from the process of determination and not exempt
from requirements on procedural fairness, but much less is required, and
inquiries
made in good faith and for proper purposes, without trickery or bias
are unlikely to require judicial control.  In relation to art
57, if
information falling within art 57 is obtained in good faith for purposes of ASX
it is difficult to suppose that there could
be any control."
<P>

91   	Whether Rule 13.1(1) in its silence <i>denies</i> a right
for non-interviewees to be present, (save where mandated by procedural fairness
requirements accommodating preservation of
the integrity of the investigation),
or would otherwise permit such presence, I would in either case imply a term to
the effect contended
by the Plaintiff.  That is to say, to give business
efficacy to Rule 13.1 with its procedural fairness overlay and to ensure that
it satisfies the statutory purpose of the Business Rules, I would preclude any
presence on behalf of a Participating Organisation
as would undermine or
threaten the integrity of the investigation in terms of it satisfying the
statutory requirement of "adequate
arrangements for monitoring and enforcing
compliance with [its] Business Rules and Listing Rules".  I would likewise
require appropriate
undertakings of confidentiality of the kind ASX seek.
<P>

92   	Quite clearly such a term is reasonable and equitable
insofar as it leaves proper scope for minimal procedural fairness, gives
business efficacy to the contract for the contract would not be effective
otherwise in terms of satisfying the statutory requirements,
is sufficiently
obvious that it goes without saying, is capable of clear expression and does
not contradict any express term of the
contract.  It thus satisfies the
requirements for implying a term in <i>BP Refinery (Western Port) Pty Limited v
Hastings Shire Council</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1977] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%2016%20ALR%20363" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 16 ALR 363</a> at 365.
<P>

93   	While it may be accepted that the test for implication of
terms into statutory contracts are more stringent (see, for example,
<i>Stanham
v The National Trust of Australia (NSW)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2015%20ACL%2087" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 15 ACL 87</a> at 90-91 per Young
J) here we have passed from a conventional statutory contract for corporations
generally to one which performs
a statutory public purpose.
<P>

94   	What I have said applies also in relation to the presence
of Atanaskovic Hartnell.  Unless Atanaskovic Hartnell gives an undertaking
in
the terms sought, it would not satisfy the requirement to maintain the
integrity of the investigation.
<P>

<b>Summing up</b>
<P>

95   	Business rule 13.1(1), taking into account its
contractual, constitutional and statutory context, neither requires nor permits
a Participating Organisation to have anyone other than the interviewee present
at the interview, save as required by requirements
of procedural fairness
accommodating the requirement of not prejudicing the integrity of the
investigation.
<P>

96   	Such requirements of procedural fairness would ordinarily
permit a legal adviser to be present and the legal adviser in turn
to have
access to those it needs in the Participating Organisation, in order to obtain
instructions or to advise.  Likewise others
from the Participating Organisation
may be present or have access to the transcripts if this is required to provide
procedural fairness
insofar as the investigation and any ultimate disciplinary
proceedings are concerned.
<P>

97   	The <i>Corporations Law</i> (Pt 7.2) and the ASX
constitution require the Business Rules to provide "adequate arrangements for
monitoring and enforcing compliance"
directed to ensuring that "each stock
market is an orderly and fair market".  The <i>Corporations Law</i> underpins
the Business Rules rendering them subject to such a public purpose.  The ASX
Business Rules, like the Listing Rules , represent
self-regulation enlisted by
statute for a public purpose;  for stock exchanges have long ceased to be
private clubs in performing
their important public role.  
<P>

98   	Consistent with that public purpose, ASX is entitled to
impose such requirements including undertakings of confidentiality
to the
extent necessary to preserve the integrity of the investigation.  By preserving
the integrity of the investigation is meant
its efficacy in providing adequate
arrangements for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the Business Rules
and Listing Rules
for the public purpose, mandated by the <i>Corporations
Law</i>, of ensuring that "each stock market of the exchange is an orderly and
fair market".
<P>

99   	Rule 13.1(1) thus imports an obligation on the ASX to
observe minimum procedural requirements of fairness.  They are the basis,
and
arguably the only basis, for permitting a legal adviser to be present at
interviews and able to obtain instructions from others
in the Participating
Organisation.  But such procedural requirements of fairness must accommodate
the overriding requirement that
the integrity of the investigation is not to be
prejudiced in furtherance of its public purpose.  And such overriding
requirement
is also an implied term imported into rule 13.1(1), necessary to
give it business efficacy in fulfilling that public purpose.
<P>

<b>CONCLUSION AND ORDERS</b>
<P>

100   	It follows that the ASX is entitled to the orders it
seeks under s777 of the <i>Corporations Law</i> or in the alternative s1114 of
the <i>Corporations Law</i>.  This is subject to hearing from the parties in
relation to Mr McLeod including whether it will be seriously disputed that he
is
a shadow director or otherwise amenable to being examined.  Indeed if either
the Defendant desired him to be examined or he were
determined to be a shadow
director, that would be decisive in requiring his being quarantined from
information about the other examinations
until he had been finally interviewed.

<P>

101   	So far as costs are concerned, ordinarily they should
follow the event but I give leave to the parties to address me on costs
if they
wish.
<P>

102   	I direct the parties to submit orders giving effect to
this judgment as soon as possible, in view of the urgency.
