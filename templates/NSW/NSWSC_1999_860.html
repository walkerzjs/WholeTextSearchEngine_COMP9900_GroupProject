<b>3673/98 - COLIN HARDCASTLE -V- SIGRID IRENE HANNELORE PERKUHN - ESTATE OF
CECILIE PIGORSCH</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	MASTER:   This is an application under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>
in respect of the estate of the late Cecilie Pigorsch who died on 7 March 1998.
The deceased was survived by her daughter, the defendant,
and the plaintiff who
alleges that he was living with the deceased as her husband on a bona fide
domestic basis since February 1994.
<P>

2  	The deceased made a number of wills.  On 23 November 1994 she
made a will under which she left her estate to her daughter. 
The plaintiff was
not mentioned in that will.  In her will of 24 June 1996, the deceased gave the
plaintiff a life estate in her
unit 4/16 Gilmore Street, Wollongong.  She gave
the residue of her estate, which included another unit, to her daughter, the
defendant.
<P>

3  	On 19 February 1998 she made her last will under which she gave
her car to the plaintiff and the residue of her estate to the
defendant, who
was also appointed executor.  The defendant did not take out probate of the
will and the plaintiff obtained a grant
of administration under s 41A of the
Wills Probate and Administration Act for the purposes of making his application
to the court.
<P>

4  	At the date of death the estate of the deceased consisted of a
motor vehicle worth $16,500 and an amount of $6000 in bank accounts.
 
<P>

5  	In this matter there have been costs incurred both on the
plaintiff's and defendant's part.  The defendant's costs were estimated
at
$24,000 and the plaintiff's at $24,500.  In order to give some background, it
is worthwhile dealing with some of the history.
<P>

6  	The deceased was born in Bavaria, Germany, in 1922 and the
plaintiff was born in Manchester, England on 13 July 1940.  The defendant's
daughter was born in Germany on 5 January 1946 and apparently the deceased
married Mr Pigorsch in  Munich in 1948.  
<P>

7  	On 26 July 1944 the deceased, the defendant and Mr Pigorsch
migrated from Germany to Australia and they first lived in Kreswick,
Victoria.
In 1955 the Pigorsch family moved to Ballarat.
<P>

8  	In 1956 they moved to a house at West Dapto in New South
Wales.
<P>

9  	In 1969 the defendant married Wolfgang Peter Perkuhn, and it was
in 1970 that the plaintiff migrated from the United Kingdom
to Australia.  He
commenced employment at Port Kembla and lived in that area thereafter.
<P>

10  	The deceased and Mr Pigorsch apparently in the early 1970s built
a block of flats on some land at 16 Gilmore Street, Wollongong
and retained a
number of flats.
<P>

11  	In 1977 the defendant, Mr Pigorsch and their children moved to
Tingha in New South Wales.  (Tingha is near Inverell, about
124 kilometres
north of Armidale.)
<P>

12  	In 1982 the plaintiff, who had been married, separated and he
was divorced in 1983.
<P>

13  	In September 1989 the deceased's husband died and several years
later in 1992, the deceased sold one of the units, being unit
number 3, in
Gilmore Street, Wollongong, for about $93,000.  That led to some trips overseas
by the deceased and the defendant to
visit relatives.
<P>

14  	It was at the end of 1992 that the plaintiff says he first met
the deceased.  He says that by December 1993 a sexual relationship
commenced
and that in February 1994 he moved into 4/16 Gilmore Street and commenced a
relationship which he described as a de facto
relationship with the
deceased.
<P>

15  	After this time there were occasions when the defendant stayed
with the deceased at Wollongong, such as December 1994.  Similarly,
her child
Neil stayed there early in 1995, and in Easter 1995 the deceased and the
plaintiff stayed with the defendant and her family
in Tingha.
<P>

16  	It was on 25 September 1995 that the plaintiff was injured in a
motor vehicle accident which led to him being unable to earn
any income as a
taxi driver, an occupation he had followed up until then.
<P>

17  	I have already dealt with the various wills made in 1994, 1996
and 1998.
<P>

18  	There were occasions in 1996 when Steven, the defendant's son,
stayed with the deceased and the plaintiff at Wollongong.
<P>

19  	It was in September 1997 that the deceased and the plaintiff
went to Europe for about six weeks.  The plaintiff went to the
United Kingdom
and the deceased to Germany and apparently the plaintiff joined the deceased in
Germany.
<P>

20  	Towards the end of 1997 the deceased started to suffer medical
problems.  In due course, on 19 February 1998, she made her
last will.  
<P>

21  	On 6 March 1998 the deceased transferred the remaining units
which she had in 16 Gilmore Street, Wollongong.  These were units
4 and 6 and
they were transferred to the defendant for no consideration.  Three days later,
on 9 March 1998, the deceased died.
<P>

22  	On 17 March 1998 the plaintiff was evicted from the unit by the
defendant.  She cut off the electricity and telephone and required
him to
immediately vacate it.  This he did and went to live in a caravan. 
<P>

23  	On 25 August 1998 a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> summons was filed in
this matter and on 3 September 1998 a notice of motion for interim relief in
respect of unit 4 was filed by
the plaintiff.  That unit, in fact, was sold in
September 1998.  Later, a further undertaking was given in respect of the sale
of
unit 6.  That unit was sold in December 1998 in circumstances which I have
already set out in an earlier judgment.  I dealt with
this aspect of the matter
fairly fully in my judgment of 24 May 1999 and also repeat what I said there
about the events and circumstances
surrounding the sale of unit 6 and the
breach by the defendant of the undertaking she had given to the parties.
<P>

24  	The question of whether or not the plaintiff and the deceased
were living together as husband and wife on a bona fide domestic
basis must be
determined in accordance with the principles recently referred to by the Court
of Appeal in <b>Light v. Anderson &amp; Ors</b> (1992) DFC 95120.  They
referred with approval to the decision of Kearney J  in <b> Simonis v.
Perpetual Trustee Co Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2021%20NSWLR%20677" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 21 NSWLR 677</a> where his Honour in
dealing with the expression in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act 1982</a> after reviewing
the authorities said at p 685 the following:
<P>

"I consider that the expression under consideration constitutes a single
composite expression of a comprehensive notion or concept
and therefore has to
be approached by considering the expression as a whole and not in several
parts.  This approach, as adopted
by Powell J, was also the approach preferred
by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Waterford's case (see 106). I
consider that
the factors referred to by Powell J while not being regarded as a
complete test, serve the purpose adequately in the present case
to determine
the question of eligible person. The factors indicated by Powell J are as
follows (at 459):
<P>

'1.	The duration of the relationship.
<P>

 
<P>

2.	The nature and extent of the common residence.
<P>

3.	Whether or not a sexual relationship
<P>

	existed.
<P>

4.	The degree of financial interdependence and
<P>

	any arrangements for support, between or
<P>

	by the parties.
<P>

5.	The ownership, use and acquisition of
<P>

	property.
<P>

6.	The procreation of children.
<P>

7.	The care and support of children.
<P>

8.	The performance of household duties.
<P>

9.	The degree of mutual commitment and mutual
<P>

	support.
<P>

10.	Reputation and "public" aspects of the relationship.'
<P>

His Honour also referred to the support to be gained for this approach from the
report of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission
concerning de facto
relationships (LRC 36 (1983)).  His Honour quoted the following passage in the
report (at 459):
<P>

	'17.10 the application of the basic
<P>

	definition to the myriad facets of
<P>

	private personal relationships between
<P>

	men and women will inevitably be a
<P>

	matter of degree and proportion.  The
<P>

	attributes and circumstances of such
<P>

	relationships differ greatly, ranging
<P>

	from what is little more than a casual
<P>

	liaison, to a continuing affectionate
<P>

	companionship, to a long term merging 
<P>

	of lives and resources.  Moreover, the
<P>

	nature and quality of a particular
<P>

	relationship may change and develop over
<P>

	time, making it sometimes very difficult
<P>

	to pin-point a time when the relationship
<P>

	should assume a new legal significance.
<P>

	As I understand it, the parties substantially
<P>

	treated Powell J's approach as being
<P>

	appropriate to the circumstances of the
<P>

	present case.'"
<P>

25  	Obviously, the list is not immutable and in particular cases
other factors will have to be considered.  The list is of use
and it is
convenient to discuss many of the incidents of the relationship between the
plaintiff and the deceased under the headings
set out above.
<P>

26  	Before dealing with the individual items, it is necessary to
deal with the questions of credit which arise.  So far as the
plaintiff's
evidence is concerned, there was some criticism of him in forming a
relationship with someone seventeen years his senior
but that I do not think
affected his acceptability as a witness.  So far as I can see, there is no
reason why I should not accept
his account.
<P>

27  	So far as the defendant is concerned, I have already formed a
view which I expressed in my judgment of 24 May.  I did not find
her a
satisfactory witness.  I was not prepared to accept her on a number of matters
and it seems to me that she professed ignorance
on a number of matters in this
case which I find quite surprising.
<P>

28  	I turn to the particular matters to which I have referred
above:
<P>

<b>1.	Duration of a relationship.</b>
<P>

29  		According to the plaintiff this commenced in February 1994.
The cross-examination demonstrated that he was really relying
on his
recollection, fixing the commencement date as some time prior to his accident
which occurred in September 1995.  He seemed
to concede that it may have been
twelve months or a little bit earlier before that that he commenced the
relationship.  I think it
is important to note that there is no reference to
him in the November 1994 will which is consistent with a relationship that,
perhaps,
had only just started.  In this circumstance it seems to me that the
relationship commenced during 1994 some time, not long before
September.  It
continued thereafter up until the death of the deceased.
<P>

<b>2.	Nature and extent of common residence.</b>
<P>

	
<P>

30  	There does not seem to be any dispute but that the deceased and
the plaintiff lived together for the relevant period.
<P>

<b>3.	Whether there was a sexual relationship.</b>
<P>

31  	According to the plaintiff there was.  There are a number of
witnesses who gave evidence which substantiates this fact.  Mrs
Glaser and Mrs
Subatic were friends of the deceased and not necessarily related to or in
sympathy with any particular party.  Their
evidence is fairly clear as to the
relationship between them. Even the son Steven supported the fact that the
plaintiff and the deceased
slept together in the same room, as did the
defendant.
<P>

<b>4.	Financial interdependence.</b>
<P>

32  	There is no evidence of any interdependence except when the trip
to Europe occurred in 1997.  Air fares of some $4500 were
paid by the plaintiff
with each of the deceased and the plaintiff contributing to other expenses.
<P>

<b>5.	The ownership, use and acquisition of property.</b>
<P>

33  	There is only one item of property which was purchased jointly
and that was the car.  The plaintiff contributed $10,000 and
the deceased her
existing car which was traded in.
<P>

<b>6 and 7.  Children.</b>
<P>

34  		These are not relevant in this case.
<P>

<b>8.	Performance of household duties.</b>
<P>

35  	Clearly the plaintiff did not like cooking and the deceased did
that.  However, there is sufficient evidence from independent
persons to
indicate that it was a household in which there were some shared household
duties.
<P>

<b>9.	Mutual commitment and mutual support.</b>
<P>

36  	There is evidence from the independent witnesses to whom I have
referred of affection between the deceased and the plaintiff.
 Some evidence to
the contrary was given by Mr Ryan but given the limited amount admitted, it has
proven nothing.  
<P>

<b>10.	Reputation and public aspects.</b>
<P>

37  	There is some evidence from the independent witnesses of the
deceased and the plaintiff attending social events at clubs and
the like in
which they displayed their affection for each other.
<P>

38  	There was in the affidavits of the defendant and also the son
evidence of statements made by the deceased to the deponents
which would
denigrate the nature of the relationship.  The difficulty with this, and
particularly with respect to the deceased's
explanation that the plaintiff was
a boarder, is that one has to understand the reason why the deceased might make
such statements,
particularly having regard to the person to whom they were
addressed.  It may be hard quite often for a deceased under these circumstances
to admit to a family member the true nature of a relationship.  However, there
certainly is nothing of a concrete manner which would
suggest in any way that
the plaintiff was a boarder.  The plain fact in this matter is that all the
evidence points to them having
lived together as man and wife since a time
prior to 1994 till March 1998.  There is thus a period of some three and a half
years
when this occurred.  The plaintiff, therefore, is an eligible person.
<P>

39  	There were submissions made by the defendant who, today, has
appeared in person, in which she raises questions of a de facto
relationship
being an unregistered marriage and questions of whether this would lead to
bigamy, and other matters relevant to Australian
citizenship.  The written
submissions will be marked as Ex 1 in the proceedings so that there is a record
of them.  However, the
matters which are raised in them really are not relevant
to this application which falls to be defined upon the terms of the provisions
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> which allow persons in the situation of the
plaintiff to claim as a de facto spouse.
<P>

40  	In applications under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>, the High Court
has recently in <b>Singer v. Berghouse</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a> set out the two
stage approach that a court must take.  At p 209 it said the following:
<P>

"The first question is, was the provision (if any) made for the applicant's
'inadequate for (his or her) proper maintenance, education
and advancement in
life?'  The difference between 'adequate' and 'proper' and the
interrelationship which exists between 'adequate
provision' and 'proper
maintenance' etc. were explained in <b>Bosch v. Perpetual Trustee Co
Limited</b>.  The determination of the first stage in the two-stage process
calls for an assessment of whether the provision (if any) made was
inadequate
for what in all the circumstances, was the proper level of maintenance etc
appropriate for the applicant having regard,
amongst other things, to the
applicant's financial position, the size and nature of the deceased's estate,
the totality of the relationship
between the applicant and the deceased, and
the relationship between the deceased and other persons who have legitimate
claims upon
his or her bounty.
<P>

The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves similar
considerations.  Indeed, in the first stage of the process,
the court may need
to arrive at an assessment of what is the proper level of maintenance and what
is adequate provision, in which
event, if it becomes necessary to embark upon
the second stage of the process, that assessment will largely determine the
order which
should be made in favour of the applicant.  In saying that, we are
mindful that there may be some circumstances in which a court
could refuse to
make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to have been left
without adequate provision for proper
maintenance.  Take, for example, a case
like <b>Ellis v. Leeder</b> where there were no assets from which an order
could reasonably be made and making an order could disturb the testator's
arrangements
to pay creditors."
<P>

41  	As directed by the High Court, I turn to look at the plaintiff's
position.  He is single, aged fifty-nine and has no dependants.
 He lives in a
caravan which he purchased for $15,000 when he moved out of the deceased's
home.  He has had a workers compensation
claim that has finally been
determined.  Although he was expected to receive about $70,000 and he did get
an award approaching this
sum, a large part of that has been taken by garnishee
to meet a liability which he has to the Child Support Agency.  In the event,
he
finally received, after deduction of that amount and a ten per cent deduction
in relation to the Health Insurance Commission,
the sum of $19,503.82.  He also
has a car which he received under the will and he exists on what payments he
receives from workers
compensation which will soon be replaced by social
security payments.
<P>

(Mr Pesman advised that the plaintiff would be receiving a five per cent return
in relation to the deduction for the Health Insurance
Commission.)
<P>

42  	I will note that he plaintiff is also to receive another five
per cent back from the deduction for the Health Insurance Commission
in due
course.
<P>

43  	The matters in respect of which the plaintiff was compensated
for in relation to workers compensation includes a 25 per cent
impairment of
his back, 25 per cent permanent loss of efficient use of his right arm above
the elbow, an eight per cent permanent
impairment of his pelvis, five per cent
permanent loss of efficient use of his right leg above the knee and also
efficient use of
his left leg above the knee.  Accordingly, he has some medical
problems.
<P>

44  	So far as the way in which the plaintiff is left without
adequate and proper provision for his maintenance, education and advancement
in
life is concerned, the case was originally put that he should receive a life
interest in one of the units of the deceased.  However,
that is not possible
but what the sales of the units do indicate is that the cost of housing in the
area in which he lives is in
the order of $100,000.  Clearly, given his limited
financial resources, he is not in a very satisfactory financial situation and
any assistance the court could give him would be appropriate.
<P>

45  	It is necessary also to consider others having a claim on the
bounty of the deceased.  In this case the only person is the
defendant.  She is
aged fifty-three, married, and apparently has no dependants.  She owns a house
in her name at Tingha in which
she and her husband reside which she said has a
value of $24,000.  She has a joint interest with her husband in another house
in
Tingha worth $24,000 which is occupied by her son Steven.  She also refers
to having a block of land worth $4000.  She and her husband
are in receipt of
Social Security, or Job Start, having given up the position of Postmaster at
Tingha.
<P>

46  	Apart from this, the defendant also has received $193,500 being
the proceeds of the two units which were transferred to her
three days before
the death of the deceased.  Those sums she has given to her husband.  There is
evidence from the husband that he
spent on a car some $16,500; $26,200 on a
trip for himself and the defendant to Germany, and the rest, bar $850, has been
disbursed
probably to their sons.
<P>

47  	It is necessary, of course, to evaluate the claim of the
plaintiff in this matter.  Widows' claims are frequently the subject
of
applications in this court.  The Court of Appeal in <b>Goloski v. Goloski</b>
(unreported 5 October 1993) has referred to formulations of this standard to be
expected in respect of a widow in terms which refer
to the decision of Powell J
in <b>Luciano v. Rosenblum</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20NSWLR%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2 NSWLR 65</a> and <b>Elliott v. Elliott</b>,
which was approved by the Court of Appeal on 24 April 1986.  There his Honour
said:
<P>

"Where the marriage of a deceased and his widow has been long and harmonious,
where the widow has loyally supported her husband
and assisted him to build up
and maintain his estate, the duty which a deceased owes to his widow can be no
less than to the extent
to which his assets permit him to achieve that result;
first of all to ensure that his widow be secured in her home for the rest
of
her life and that if either the need arises or the whim strikes her she have
the capacity to change her home; secondly that she
have available to her an
income sufficient to enable her to live in a reasonable degree of comfort and
free from any financial worry;
and, third, that she have available to her a
fund to which she might have resort in order to provide herself with such
modest luxuries
as she might choose and which would provide her with a hedge
against any unforeseen contingency or disaster that life might bring."
<P>

48  	Widowers are treated in the same way as are other long term
partners of a deceased person; particularly this also applies to
persons who
live in a de facto relationship with the deceased.  In this case there are a
number of differences from what was referred
to by the court there.  However,
it should be noted that the plaintiff has contributed to the car which they
both enjoyed while the
deceased was alive and he also purchased air tickets for
a trip overseas.  The extent of the contributions in part can be seen in
the
type of provision which the deceased made in 1996 in her will.  
<P>

49  	However, the relationship was one which was only of a short
duration, a total of some three and a half years.  One cannot in
any sense
compare that to the type of relationship which the court was referring to in
<b>Goloski v. Goloski</b> to which I have referred.  In particular, there is
the need for a very long relationship and a building up of assets over a
period.
 In my view, having regard to the shortness of the relationship and to
the situation of the various parties, it would be appropriate
if the plaintiff
were to receive a legacy of $60,000. The question of how it can be paid must be
faced.  
<P>

50  	It can only be paid by designating property as notional estate
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23(b)(ii).</a>  Under that section the court may, subject to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 26</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">27</a> and
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">28</a>, make an order designating property as notional estate of the deceased
person such property as it may specify being property which
is held by or on
trust by the disponee, whether or not that property was the subject of the
prescribed transaction.  Here clearly
the transfer of the two units to the
defendant three days before the death of the deceased without consideration
constitutes a prescribed
transaction with the defendant being the disponee.
<P>

51  	In the circumstances of this case it is probably clear that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
25(1)</a> applies.  That section deals with subsequent dispositions made by the
person who received the property, such as that which occurred
when the
defendant gave away the proceeds to her husband.  I have not considered the
detail of that because, firstly, the question
of special circumstances has to
be considered and that has not been debated before me but, more particularly,
for any appropriate
order to be made there would have to be other necessary
parties, such as the defendant's husband or sons to whom the property might
have passed.
<P>

52  	One of the items of property which the defendant does own is her
house in Tingha.  The plaintiff has asked that this be designated
as notional
estate.  Quite clearly, since 24 May 1999, the fact that this property may be
affected has been apparent to the defendant,
given the terms of the injunction
which I granted on that day.
<P>

53  	Before I can designate the property a notional estate I have to
consider the matters in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 27.</a>  Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 27(1)(a)</a> I have to consider the
importance of not interfering with reasonable expectations in relation to the
property.  The only expectations
here are the fact that the deceased
transferred it to the defendant and obviously expressed a wish for her to have
it.  However,
nothing else has been dealt with in the evidence.  Having regard
to the matters which I will deal with next, these are not matters
which would
disincline me to designate the property as notional estate.
<P>

54  	Under sub-s (b) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 27(1)</a> I have to consider the substantial
justice and merits involved in making or refusing to make the order.  In this
case there is clear
animosity between the two parties. There has, in the
circumstances in which I have dealt with earlier in this judgment, been a
deliberate
breach of the undertaking given by the defendant and there has also
been a fairly clear course of disposing of the proceeds of the
sale of the
units.  The affidavits of the defendant and her husband give no proper account
of what has happened to the money other
than the small amounts to which I have
referred.
<P>

55  	The money is said to have been given by the defendant to her
husband who is then said to have given the balance to their sons.
 No
explanation for why this money was given has been proffered.  No suggestion was
raised for the sons having a need and no explanation
as to why the assets of
the defendant were reduced.  In particular, the defendant's complete lack of
interest in what might have
happened to the money is very surprising.  In the
circumstances I can only conclude that this was part of a deliberate attempt in
order to foil the plaintiff's application.  
<P>

56  	In those circumstances, the justice and the merits are on the
plaintiff's side and not on the defendant's.  There does not
appear to be other
matters which I should take into account, particularly in relation to sub-s
(c).  Clearly under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 28(1)</a> there is insufficient to accommodate any necessary
order and under sub-s (2) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 28</a> the property, if anything, would be far less
than is necessary to satisfy the judgment.  Therefore it is appropriate to
designate
the house as a notional property.
<P>

57  	The plaintiff also sought additional orders, seeking orders that
the defendant file and serve an affidavit setting out the
circumstances of
disbursement of the proceeds of sale of units 4 and 6.  This is in order to
facilitate the designation perhaps of
other property as notional estate. The
court is given a number of ancillary and consequential powers under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15</a> of the
Act.  In  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15(1)(a)(ix)</a> the court is given power to make orders with respect
to the securing either wholly or partially of a due performance of an order
under the section and under (xi) the executing of any necessary conveyance,
document or instrument, purchasing of such documents
and title for the vendor
and such other things that the court thinks necessary in relation to the
performance of any order.  There
is also a general power in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15(1)(b)</a> to make
such orders with respect to such other matters as the court thinks
necessary.
<P>

58  	In the circumstances where there has been a disposition by the
defendant of substantial property in the estate, which has the
effect of
defeating an order, it is, I think, necessary to ascertain with some precision
what is the other property which the defendant
owns and what happened so far as
the defendant may know  to the property which was received.
<P>

59  	So far as costs are concerned, the defendant certainly has
incurred costs.  She has been unrepresented at today's hearing,
her solicitors
apparently no longer acting for her.  They have filed an appropriate notice of
ceasing to act and the defendant has
filed an appearance.  The amount of the
costs no doubt have been incurred but in case some question might arise as far
as recoupment
from the estate, I think the defendant should pay her own costs
and that she should have no entitlement to reimbursement of her costs
from the
estate.  Clearly I think the defendant ought to pay the plaintiff's costs.
<P>

	Accordingly, the orders I make in this matter are as follows:
<P>

1.	That in addition to the bequest in the will of the deceased that the
plaintiff receive a legacy of $60,000.
<P>

2.	Designate as notional estate the defendant's property which she owns in
Museum Street, Tingha, New South Wales.
<P>

3.	Order the defendant to file and serve within twenty-one days of today's date
an affidavit setting out her present financial situation
and, in particular:
<P>

	(a)	in respect of any real estate in which she has an interest -
<P>

		(i)  the extent of her interest.
<P>

	    (ii)  the address and reference to the title of the real estate.
<P>

	   (iii)	any known value thereof.
<P>

	(b)	in respect of any other property -
<P>

		(i)  the extent of her interest.
<P>

	    (ii)	a description of the property.
<P>

	   (iii)	any known value thereof.
<P>

	And also setting out to the best of her knowledge the disposition of the sale
proceeds of units 4 and 6, 16 Gilmore Street, Wollongong,
by her husband.
<P>

3.	The defendant is not to recover her costs out of the estate.
<P>

4.	The defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs and is not entitled to
reimbursement of the same from the estate.
<P>

5.	I direct the plaintiff if he wishes to seek the designation of any
additional property as notional estate to file and serve a
notice of motion
within two months of today's date seeking the same and the joinder of any
additional parties.
<P>
