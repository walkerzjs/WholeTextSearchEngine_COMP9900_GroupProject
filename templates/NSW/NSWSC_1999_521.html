Thursday 2 June 1999
<P>

<b>1070/99 SOUTHERN AIR CONDITIONING v BALANCING AND COMMISSIONING
SERVICES</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	MASTER MACREADY:  This is an application to set aside a creditor's Statutory
Demand for payment of a debt.  The Statutory Demand
which was served by the
defendant on the plaintiff claims the amount of $41,860.50 and was dated 22
December 1998.  The plaintiff's
business is the supply and installation of
commercial air conditioning and the defendant was engaged by the plaintiff to
install
air and water systems to two projects, one being Sydney Central Plaza
project and the other Royal Exchange Pitt Street project. 
The plaintiff was a
sub-contractor on those sites.
<P>

2	The Statutory Demand has particulars of the amounts due by reference to the
outstanding invoices.  Two of them, invoice No 8943
for $1,800 and invoice 8997
for $438 are for the Central Plaza project.  The others are for the Royal
Exchange Pitt Street project.
 
<P>

3	I will first deal with the Sydney Central Plaza project.  That project was
originally for a contract price of $120,800.  In due
course given the various
pressures in the performance of the project there was agreement that the final
cost of the project would
be $185,000.  The defendants have been paid $182,762
for the work on that project and the amount outstanding corresponds to the two
invoices I have mentioned above, namely, a total of $2,238.  
<P>

4	The plaintiff suggests that there is a dispute as to this amount because of
the failure of the defendant to complete his work
under the contract.  It
alleges that the defendant has failed to complete the test reports which are
required once the commissioning
of the various air conditioning and other
systems are complete.  The failure of the defendants to do this work has led
the plaintiffs
to have to recheck the air conditioning systems and prepare test
reports in order to complete their contractual obligations with
Multiplex, the
head contractor.  Although the evidence does not establish precisely what is
the cost of this work in the context
of the contract price and the small amount
left in issue there is a genuine dispute in relation to this matter.  
<P>

5	Apart from the genuine dispute the defendants suggest that the matter is not
able to be raised because the affidavit which was
filed in support of the
application to set aside the demand was not a sufficient affidavit for the
purposes of the Act.  It is necessary
for the affidavit to comply with certain
standards. 
<P>

6	The law in this regard is conveniently set out in the Judgment of Sunburg J
in <b>Graywinter Properties Pty. Limited v Gas and Fuel Corporation
Superannuation Fund</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1996/822.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] FCA 822</a>; ,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=21%20ACSR%20581" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">21 ACSR, 581.</a>  At 587.8 his Honour had the following
to say:
<P>

	"Is a complying affidavit a condition of jurisdiction?
<P>

	It seems to me that s 459G(3) makes plain that the Court can entertain an
application to set aside only if within the prescribed
period an affidavit
supporting the application is filed and copies of the application and affidavit
are served.  The High Court in
Grant said that compliance with the subsection
is a limitation or a condition upon the authority of the Court to set aside a
demand;
it is a condition of the jurisdiction that subs (3) be observed; if the
condition is not observed there is no application before
the Court.  I am thus
unable to agree with the Senior Master that the failure of an affidavit to
satisfy the minimum requirements
for an affidavit to be a "supporting
affidavit" is not a jurisdictional impediment.
<P>

	The minimum requirements in a genuine dispute case.
<P>

	In order to be a "supporting affidavit", an affidavit must  say something that
promotes the company's case.  An affidavit which
merely says "I am a director
of the company but am too busy at present to make a full affidavit, and I will
do so later" would not
support the application.  It would in no way advance,
further or assist the company's cause, which is to have the notice set aside.
At the other extreme, the affidavit need not detail, in admissible form, all
the evidence that supports the contention of a genuine
dispute: John Holland.
That evidence must be available at the hearing of the application to set aside,
because that application is
for final and not interlocutory relief:  71 Paisley
Street.
<P>

	In a s 459H1(a) case, the affidavit must in my view disclose facts showing
there is a genuine dispute between the parties.  A mere
assertion that there is
a genuine dispute not enough.  Nor is there a bare claim that the debt is
disputed sufficient.  It follows
from the fact that the affidavit need not go
into evidence, which is the customary function of an affidavit, that it may
read like
a pleading.
<P>

	An affidavit which exhibits an exchange of correspondence between the parties
or between their solicitors from which it appears
that a claim is made and
rejected for reasons given can qualify as a supporting affidavit.  And an
affidavit verifying the pleadings
in an action may qualify.
<P>

	I am thus unable to accept the respondent's submission that the affidavit must
contain sufficient material to make out a case under
s 459H.  In reply, that
submission was somewhat retreated from. It was said that the affidavit must, as
a minimum, contain a statement
of the material facts on which the applicant
intends to rely to show a genuine dispute - it might read more like a pleading
than
a story.  That accords with what I consider to be the minimum
requirement.
<P>

	.........A multitude of affidavits?
<P>

	In several cases, it has been held that an applicant is not restricted on the
hearing to the affidavit that is served with the
application.  See Scanhill at
467 and Mibor Investments Pty. Limited v Commonwealth Bank of Australia <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1994/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] VicRp 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACSR%20362" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993)
11 ACSR 362</a> at 368.  An applicant whose initial affidavit has satisfied the
threshold test must be able to supplement the material, because while
the
"supporting" affidavit does not have to deploy the evidence, on the hearing
only admissible evidence can be relied on.  In Louisbridge,
Ryan J said that
"provided that an affidavit is filed and served within the 21 day period which
supports the application by providing
grounds for concluding that there is a
genuine dispute... or that the company has an offsetting claim", supporting
affidavits may
be filed under the period has expired.  Apart from Hire Works,
the cases do not support the proposition for which the applicant contended,
namely that an affidavit that does not satisfy the threshold test can be
supplemented later on.  That issue did not arise in Scanhill
or Mibor.  It did
arise in Hire Works, but for the reasons I have given, I am respectfully unable
to agree that  the Court can entertain
as an application under s 459G a case in
which an affidavit containing the minimum requirements has not been served
within time."
<P>

	Given the fact that the affidavit does not need to be in strictly admissible
form, I think it is appropriate to consider the whole
of the affidavit, not
just the part that was admitted into evidence on the hearing before me.
<P>

7	The relevant affidavit is that of Mark Grynberg of 12 January 1999.
Paragraphs 4 and 5 of that affidavit are in the following
terms:-
<P>

	"The Defendant, Balancing and Commissioning Services Pty Limited was engaged
by the Plaintiff to install air and water systems
on the Sydney Central Plaza
Project and the Royal Exchange Pitt Street projects which are projects on which
the Plaintiff is a subcontractor
for the supply and installation of mechanical
services which includes air conditioning and ventilation systems.
<P>

	I have reviewed the Plaintiff's records in relation to the work performed by
the Defendant on the Sydney Central Plaza project.
 Those records indicate the
Defendant has bee paid for all work performed in relation to the Sydney Central
Plaza Contract.  
<P>

	To date, the Plaintiff has been paid the sum of $182,762 to the Defendant in
relation to the Sydney Central Plaza Project."
<P>

8	It is suggested that the full purport of the dispute which emerged from the
later affidavits could not be gleaned from paragraph
5 above.  In my view given
the reference in the last sentence to the amount that has been paid  the
affidavit asserts that there
has been payment for work done.  Accordingly, I
would have thought it would have been a sufficient affidavit to put the
plaintiff's
case on that aspect.  
<P>

9	I turn to the Royal Exchange Pitt Street project which concerns the balance
of $39,622.50.  In respect of the contractual arrangements
between the parties
in respect of this project there are some difficulties.  Work commenced on the
project on 29 May 1998.  Prior
to that there was a discussion between the
representatives of each side when it was acknowledged that given the absence of
knowledge
about the amount of work needed on existing systems work would be
done on a do and charge basis.  Shortly prior to 3 August a quote
was requested
of the defendant and on 3 August a quote was sent bearing that date.  The quote
was for $79,650 and the quotes specifically
covered matters included in the
quote and other matters not included.  The matters included were:- 
<P>

(a) Basement supply and exhaust systems.
<P>

(b) Ground floor A/C supply.
<P>

(c) Levels 1 - 26 centre zone and perimeter zone A/C systems.
<P>

10	Excluded were all other systems due to their unknown state and the amount of
testing required.  The systems were stair pressurisation
and smoke exhaust,
outside air VCUs, toilet exhaust and tearoom exhaust.  The water system balance
was quoted at $18,000 and this
was later reduced to $12,000.  
<P>

11	In due course the plaintiff issued what was described as a material
requisition which was dated 11 August 1998.  That included
the systems covered
in the quote I have just referred to but also included additional systems of
stair pressurisation, smoke exhaust,
O/A TX and tearoom exhaust all for the
price of $79,650.  There is a dispute about this document the defendant's
representative having
sworn that it was not received until November.  Clearly
there is raised a question as to what might be the contractual arrangements
and
the extent of the work that was within the fixed price quote.  The defendant
submitted during the course of the contract a number
of invoices both in
respect of the works under what it described as the original contract for
$79,650 and also for extra works. 
Clearly the invoices under the original
contract are in the nature of progress claims.
<P>

12	Another matter in which the parties are at issue in respect of this project
is the amount that has been paid.  According to the
plaintiff a sum of $68,980
has so far been paid for the Royal Exchange project.  This has been  supported
by its internal records.
 The defendant, however, suggests through its
representative, Mr Milling, that only $44,930 has been paid by the plaintiff in
relation
to works at the Royal Exchange project.  That statement is not
supported by any records which are in evidence.  According to the
defendant's
case there are three invoices outstanding.  The first is invoice 8909 for the
sum of $5,600 and the second, 8939 in the
sum of $25,000.  These are simply
progress claims for what the defendant called the original contract.  The other
outstanding invoice
8957 is for $9,022.50 which clearly is for extras or what
the defendant believed were extra works. 
<P>

13	The defendant stopped work on the site and there also appears to be a
dispute about completion of the work.  Although the defendant
concedes that
level 2 air conditioning work was not done it has reduced the amount of its
claim to take account of this.  According
to the plaintiff the defendant has
not completed all the work that was required to be done and this included
provision of documentation
for the test data reports, test systems for the 12th
floor of the project and miscellaneous exhaust systems which were part of the
contract works according to the plaintiff.  They estimate the amount of this
between $4,000 and $9,000.  During the period before
the defendant left the job
there were attempts at reconciling the amounts outstanding.  In a fax of the 12
November 1998 the plaintiff
conceded that on its figures there was a balance
outstanding of $14,117.50.  
<P>

14	If one stands back and looks at the areas of dispute which have emerged it
is clear that there are disputes between the parties
as to what was included in
the contract price of $79,650.  There is a dispute as to the amount that has
been paid and there is a
dispute as to the completion of the work.  On the
evidence before me one would incline to the plaintiff's version as to how much
has been paid given the details that they have provided.  It is suggested that
in order to meet the amounts which might be outstanding
for any particular
invoices the plaintiff would have to establish an offsetting claim.  It would
seem to me that the arrangements
between the parties were that invoices issued
for the contract were claims for payment by way of progress claim as the works
progressed.
 Accordingly, the matter should be treated as a genuine dispute not
an offsetting claim.
<P>

15	I had the benefit of having a number of submissions in respect of the
principles to be applied and I think probably the most
useful summation is that
given by McLelland CJ in Equity in <b>Eyota Pty Limited v Hanave Pty Limited
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2012%20ACLC%20669" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 12 ACLC 669.</a>  At page 671 his Honour made the following comments
respect of the expression "Genuine dispute":
<P>

		"It is, however, necessary to consider the meaning of the expression 'genuine
dispute' where it occurs in s.459H.  In my opinion
that expression connotes a
plausible contention requiring investigation, and raises much the same sort of
considerations as the 'serious
question to be tried' criterion which arises on
an application for an interlocutory injunction or for the extension or removal
of
a caveat.  This does not mean that the Court must accept uncritically as
giving rise to a genuine dispute, every statement in an
affidavit 'however
equivocal, lacking in precision, inconsistent with undisputed contemporary
documents or other statements by the
same deponent, or inherently improbable in
itself, it may be' not having 'sufficient prima facie plausibility to merit
further investigation
as to (its) truth' (cf <b>Eng Mee Yong v Letchumanan</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20AC%20331" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) AC 331</a> at 341), or 'a patently feeble legal argument, or an assertion of
facts unsupported by evidence' (cf <b>South Australia v Wall </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%2024%20SASR%20189" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 24 SASR
189</a> at 194).
<P>

	But it does mean that, except in such an extreme case, a Court required to
determine whether there is a genuine dispute should
not embark upon an inquiry
as to the credit of a witness or a deponent whose evidence is relied on as
giving rise to the dispute.
 There is a clear difference between, on the one
hand, determining whether there is a genuine dispute and, on the other hand,
determining
the merits of, or resolving, such a dispute.  In <b>Mibor
Investments </b>(at ACLC  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1066%20ACSR%20366%2d7" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1066; ACSR 366-7)</a> Hayne J said, after referring to the
state of the law prior to the enactment of Division 3 of Part 5.4 of the
Corporations Law, and
to the terms of Division 3:
<P>

	'These matters, taken in combination, suggest that at least in those cases, it
is not expected that the Court will embark upon
any extended inquiry in order
to determine whether there is a genuine dispute between the parties and
certainly will not attempt
to weigh the merits of that dispute.  All that the
legislation requires is that the Court conclude that there is a dispute and
that
it is a genuine dispute.'
<P>

	In <b>Re Morris Catering (Australia) Pty Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACLC%20919" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 ACLC 919</a> at
922;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACSR%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 ACSR 601</a> at 605 Thomas J said:
<P>

	'There is little doubt that Division 3 . . . prescribes a formula that
requires the Court to assess the position between the parties,
and preserve
demands where it can be seen that there is no genuine dispute and no sufficient
genuine offsetting claim.  That is not
to say that the Court will examine the
merits or settle the dispute.  The specified limits of the Court's examination
are the ascertainment
of whether there is a "genuine dispute" and whether there
is a "genuine claim".
<P>

	It is often possible to discern the spurious, and to identify mere bluster or
assertion.  But beyond a perception of genuineness
(or the lack of it) the
Court has no function.  It is not helpful to perceive that one party is more
likely than the other to succeed,
or that the eventual state of the account
between the parties is more likely to be one result than another.
<P>

	The essential task is relatively simply - to identify the genuine level of a
claim (not the likely result of it) and to identify
the genuine level of an
offsetting claim (not the likely result of it).'
<P>

	I respectfully agree with those statements."
<P>

16	It is particularly difficult in building and construction matters, because
of the detail needed to resolve them, to determine
precisely what is the
correct result.  In <b>John Holland Construction &amp; Engineering v Kilpatric
Green </b>(1994) 12 ACLC 716 His Honour Mr Justice Young was involved in matter
involving a statutory demand and the question of whether there
was a genuine
dispute.  In that case His Honour commented on the evidence which largely
consisted of assertions in correspondence
between the parties.  He said:-
<P>

	"It would seem to me that in the present case, where the proprietor has
asserted that, a particular amount only is the value of
the work, and that
amount is put forward by the contractor to the sub-contractor, then even if
there is nothing before the court
to show how the amount is made up, there is a
genuine dispute between the contractor and the sub-contractor as to the amount
of all
sums over and above that admitted value of the work."
<P>

17	He then went on to comment as follows:-
<P>

	"It may be that I am doing a disservice to this Court in approaching the
matter in this mathematical way.  It may be that it is
far more appropriate in
the instant sort of case for the court to just take a broad brush approach.
Thus the court might just say
that because this is not a debt collecting court,
where there is a construction case of this nature, the demand should be set
aside
under section 459(1)(b) whenever it can be seen from the correspondence
that there are honestly held views on either side which have
brought a dispute
between the parties.  Thus, the matter can be dealt with in the ordinary way in
which construction disputes are
dealt with without the time and expense that is
involved in running this sort of litigation ahead of that dispute.  If I were
to
do that in the instant case, I would come to the same result."
<P>

18	Looking at the range of disputes and the parties in this matter it seems to
me that there is a genuine dispute except as to the
extent of the amount the
plaintiff has admitted in its fax of 12 November.  Allowing a deduction from
that of $9,000 there is an
amount outstanding of $5,117.50.  In these
circumstances the appropriate order is that the statutory demand be varied by
reducing
the amount to $5,117.50.
<P>

19	I will hear the parties on costs.
