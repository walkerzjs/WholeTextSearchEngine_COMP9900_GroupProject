<b>MASTER McLAUGHLIN</b>
<P>

<i>Friday, 5 February 1999</i>
<P>

<b>2839/89	CHRISTOPHER STEPHEN MOSS  -v-  GIO HOLDINGS PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:   </b>By Notice of Motion filed on 31 August
1998 the defendant, GIO Holdings Pty Limited (now known as GIO Finance
Limited), seeks an order
that leave be granted to it to file an Amended Defence
in the form of the document which is annexed to that Notice of Motion.  In
the
alternative, the defendant seeks leave to withdraw its admission to the
allegations contained in paragraph 3 of the Statement
of Claim and to
substitute for such admission the Amended Defence which is annexed to the
Notice of Motion.
<P>

2   	The substantive proceedings were instituted by the filing
on 31 May 1989 of a Statement of Claim by the plaintiff, Christopher
Stephen
Moss.  Essentially, that Statement of Claim asserts that there had been an
agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant
for the defendant to lend
money to the plaintiff for the purpose of conducting the development of a
commercial site at Port Macquarie
and that in consequence of the ultimate
failure of the defendant to lend that money the plaintiff suffered loss.
<P>

3   	The defendant filed a Defence to that Statement of Claim on
22 August 1989.  Subsequently, particulars of the Statement of
Claim were
provided by the plaintiff and discovery was made by the defendant.  It will be
appreciated that that discovery was made
on the issues which emerged from the
pleadings as they then stood and presently stand.
<P>

4   	There has been a considerable delay by both parties in the
conduct of the present proceedings.  That delay is attributable,
at least in
part, to the fact that for a period from 24 June 1994 until 26 March 1996, the
plaintiff was bankrupt.  The bankruptcy
was annulled on that latter date.  That
bankruptcy does not entirely explain, however, the delays on the part of the
plaintiff and,
further, does not go very far to explain the delays on the part
of the defendant.  One can only assume that the defendant was content
to allow
the matter to remain more or less in abeyance and not to press to have the
matter brought on for hearing, or to have the
proceedings dismissed for want of
prosecution.
<P>

5   	On 8 December 1997, the present solicitors for the
defendant were retained by the defendant in the proceedings.  There had
also,
at an earlier stage, been a change in the solicitors representing the
plaintiff.  It would appear that it is essentially as
a result of the change in
the legal representation of the defendant that the defendant now desires to
amend its Defence and has brought
the present application for that purpose.
<P>

6   	It has been submitted on behalf of the defendant that the
practical effect of the filing of the proposed Amended Defence is
not to change
in any substantive way the issues which have already emerged upon the
proceedings as they presently stand; but rather
that any possible ambiguity
which might appear on those pleadings be removed, and that the Defence would
clearly assert not that
a binding agreement had come into existence between the
parties, but that there only had ever been a conditional agreement between
the
parties which, as is asserted by the defendant in the Amended Defence, did not
ever come to fruition as a binding agreement because,
so it is asserted, the
conditions were not fulfilled by the plaintiff.  
<P>

7   	The plaintiff opposes leave being granted to the defendant
to file the Amended Defence.  The plaintiff rightly points to the
fact that the
present Defence has remained on foot for a period from 22 August 1989 until the
present time and that the present application
was made precisely nine years
after the filing of the Defence.
<P>

8   	The plaintiff points to the fact that the discovery which
has been made by the defendant has been made upon the issues which
have emerged
on the pleadings as they presently stand and points to the fact that over a
period of ten years the recollection of
witnesses, indeed the availability of
witnesses, can be affected, and, to the extent that the issues may be altered,
there could
arise other problems of evidence, in relation, for example, to
documentary evidence.
<P>

9   	It must be appreciated that the liberal use of the power to
amend is one of the hallmarks of the modern judicial system and
that, generally
speaking, amendments ought be permitted if they allow the Court to determine
the real dispute between the parties.
 
<P>

10   	The High Court of Australia in <i>The State of Queensland
v J L Holdings Pty Limited </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20189%20CLR%20146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 189 CLR 146</a> gave consideration to this
question of amendment of pleadings. Kirby J referred in his judgment to
considerations which may tend
to favour the extension of an indulgence to a
party applying for it and to considerations which tend to argue against the
grant of
such an indulgence; but ultimately the basis upon which the Court must
exercise the discretion vested in it to allow or withhold
the leave to a party
to amend its pleadings must depend upon the question of doing justice between
the two parties. 
<P>

11   	I am in agreement with the submission made on behalf of
the plaintiff that there has been no real explanation as to why, after
almost
ten years, the defendant now wishes to amend its Defence.  The fact that the
defendant has changed its legal representation
may have brought about the
present application. But there is certainly no evidence before the Court as to
why the previous legal
representatives of the defendant, having prepared,
presumably after due consideration, a Defence in the form of that which was
filed
on 22 August 1989, did not seek to amend that Defence in the way in which
the present solicitors now seek to amend it.  There is
no evidence before the
Court which suggests that the previous solicitors for the defendant did not
have before them the entirety
of the material which would have enabled them to
prepare a Defence, placing before the Court in an appropriate fashion the
assertions
of the defendant in relation to the present claim of the
plaintiff.
<P>

12   	I have considerable sympathy with the situation in which
the plaintiff finds himself, especially concerning the possible evidentiary
problems which were outlined by Counsel for the plaintiff as constituting
possible prejudice to the plaintiff if the amendment were
allowed.
Nevertheless, there is no specific evidence that any of those possible problems
will, in fact, confront the plaintiff. 
Further, Counsel for the defendant has
expressly informed the Court that the issue which would arise upon the filing
of the proposed
Amended Defence would not in any way cause different or further
discovery to be required by the parties to the proceedings.
<P>

13   	The conclusion at which I have arrived is that despite the
unsatisfactory circumstances in which the present application has
been made and
the very considerable delay in the making of the application, I should
nevertheless grant to the defendant the leave
which it seeks to file the
Amended Defence.
<P>

14   	I will hear Counsel on the appropriate costs order.
<P>

15   	(Counsel address the Master on costs.)
<P>

16   	(Mr Rich sought leave to refer the Master to an affidavit
of Jeffrey Mannion, former solicitor for the plaintiff, to explain
the delay in
prosecuting the matter.)
<P>

17   	<b>MASTER</b>:  I have now heard submissions concerning
the costs of the present application.  The defendant submits, since it has been
successful
in its application for leave to amend the Defence, there should be
no costs presently awarded against it but that the costs of the
application to
amend should be costs in the proceeding.  The plaintiff, on the other hand,
submits that he should be awarded the
costs of the application to amend, and,
further, that those costs should be awarded on the indemnity basis, and that,
in any event,
those costs, if awarded, should be allowed to be assessed
forthwith, so that the plaintiff will not have to wait until the conclusion
of
the substantive proceedings before receiving the benefit of any costs which
might be made in his favour in relation to the present
application.
<P>

18   	The defendant has been successful in its application to
amend the Defence.  However, that fact is not, of itself, determinative
of the
question of costs.  The defendant was seeking the exercise of a discretion by
the Court.  The defendant waited more than nine
years since the Defence was
originally filed before making the application.  There was no evidence to
suggest that the material upon
which the present application was made was not,
in its entirety, available to the solicitors who had prepared the original
Defence.
 Although the plaintiff was not successful in its resistance to the
application, I consider that the plaintiff was justified in opposing
the
application.  
<P>

19   	In all the circumstances, I consider that the plaintiff is
entitled to have his costs of the application to amend.  I am not,
however,
satisfied that there is any ground upon which I should order that the costs
should be other than the normal party and party
costs.  The considerable delay
in making the application does not, of itself, justify an award of indemnity
costs.  However, I do
propose to grant leave to the plaintiff to proceed
forthwith to assessment of the costs so that the plaintiff will not be kept out
of receiving the benefit of that costs order until after the conclusion of the
substantive proceedings.
<P>

20   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I make an order as in paragraph 1 in the Notice of Motion filed by the
defendant on 31 August 1998,  such Amended Defence to
be filed on or before 12
February 1999.
<P>

2.	I order that the defendant pay the costs of the plaintiff of the aforesaid
Notice of Motion, such costs to be on the party and
party basis.
<P>

3.	I grant leave to the plaintiff to proceed forthwith to assessment of the
foregoing costs. 
<P>

21   	Are there any other orders or directions I should make?
<P>

22   	HODGEKISS:  I would ask that soon after 12 February that
the matter come back before the Registrar for directions as the plaintiff
will
then be in a position to contemplate further directions and then affidavits can
go on to make sure the matter is, in a relatively
short time, ready to be put
in the list.
<P>

23   	RICH:  I have no objection to that course, Master.
<P>

24   	DISCUSSION ON ADJOURNMENT DATE
<P>

25   	<b>MASTER</b>:  I add to my previous orders:
<P>

4.	I stand the matter over to Tuesday 16 February 1999 before the Registrar,
for directions.
