<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed 2 February 1998 the
plaintiff seeks an extension of time within which to commence proceedings
pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 60G</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">60I</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b> 1969 (NSW) (as amended)
(the Act).  The plaintiff relied on his affidavit sworn 3 June 1998, two
affidavits of Wai-On Phoon sworn
10 September 1998 and 19 April 1999, two
affidavits of Cameron Lindsay Thompson sworn 18 May 1999 and 27 May 1999 and
the affidavit
of Mark Joseph Donohoe sworn 15 May 1999.  The defendants relied
on the affidavit of Jeffrey Scott McGee sworn 9 June 1998 and two
affidavits of
Julian Lee sworn 14 September 1998.  
<P>

2  	By statement of claim the plaintiff pleads that as a consequence
of exposure from 1978 to 1994 to PVC solvent cement and glues
manufactured
and/or supplied by the defendants he contracted chemical hypersensitivity
syndrome.
<P>

3  	It is alleged that the first defendant manufactured, marketed and
sold a PVC solvent and that the second and third defendants
marketed and sold
different brands of PVC solvents.  By paragraph (9) of the statement of claim
the plaintiff gives particulars of
negligence namely that the defendants failed
to give the plaintiff any or any adequate warning that fumes from the
industrial glues
were dangerous to humans and any or any adequate warning that
the plaintiff should avoid exposure to fumes from the industrial glues
and
could do so by the use of masks.
<P>

4  	I carefully observed the plaintiff giving evidence and being
cross examined.  I formed the view that he was giving truthful
evidence and I
accept it.  For the purposes of this application I find the following facts.
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff was born on 17 July 1934 and is now 65 years of age.  He
married on 15 April 1954 and has two children.  Since
1980 the plaintiff has
resided at Hallidays Point.  
<P>

(2)	The plaintiff began working as a plumber in about 1957 and in 1961 he
obtained his plumbers' licence.  He worked in Sydney as
a plumber for about 22
years and conducted his own business as a plumber since about 1969.
<P>

(3)	In the early 1960's PVC pipes were introduced but were only used in small
quantities for specific purposes such as aboveground
piping, kitchens,
laundries and bathroom sinks.  In or about 1978 the NSW Water Board approved
the use of PVC pipes for sewer work.
<P>

(4)	From about 1978 until the plaintiff moved to Hallidays Point he used both
PVC pipes and terracotta pipes in his business.  The
PVC pipes were used for
above ground work and the terracotta pipes for underground sewerage
connections.  Terracotta pipes did not
require the use of any glues or
chemicals. All that was necessary was to fit the pipes with rubber rings.  With
PVC pipes it was
necessary to use the PVC glue which was provided for that
specific purpose.  
<P>

(5)	After moving to Hallidays Point in 1980 the plaintiff used PVC pipes
exclusively in his plumbing work and used the glue or cement
recommended by the
manufacturer.  These are:  "My-T-Bond, White Label, PVC Solvent Cement",
Raymor's PVC Solvent Cement" and "Coleman's
Plumbing Supplies PVC Solvent
Cement" and "My-T-Bond Pink Priming Fluid for PVC Pipe Fittings".  The plumbing
solvents, glue and
primer are used for various purposes such as roughening
surfaces to prepare them for joining, cleansing the surfaces and gluing the
joints.
<P>

(6)	In about 1978 the plaintiff was suffering from sore muscles and stomach.
The plaintiff was referred to Dr Fails a specialist
who advised him that his
sore muscles were a result of being "too fit" and that his body was telling him
to slow down so he should
ease up on his work load.  Dr Fails thought that the
plaintiff had diverticulitis.  From about July 1980 for 18 months the plaintiff
ceased work as a plumber as he was still experiencing some symptoms.  He then
resumed working reduced hours.
<P>

(7)	In about 1982 the plaintiff attended Dr Thurlow who referred him to Dr
Bernard Lake in Sydney who conducted numerous tests but
nothing specific could
be found wrong with him.
<P>

(8)	In about 1985 the Department of Public Works provided access to the sewer
for Hallidays Point and the plaintiff commenced working
long hours connecting
houses to the sewerage system.
<P>

(9)	In 1987 the plaintiff began to get severe shooting pains in both arms, sore
feet and hands and in his arm muscles and commenced
having respiratory problems
including chest infections.  The plaintiff was admitted to Taree hospital for
about one week for investigations.
 The plaintiff was experiencing palpitations
and dizzy spells and he was put on Isopton to treat the palpitations.  At this
time
he thought that the glue caused his symptoms to worsen but he did not
understand what the connection was (t 6.10).
<P>

(10)	In April 1991 while at work, the plaintiff experienced a sudden episode of
dizziness, rapid heart beat, sweating and blurred
vision.  At that time it
occurred to him that there may have been some connection between his symptoms
and the glue which he had
been using to join the PVC pipes under a mobile home.
He sniffed the glue and in "10 seconds flat" he was as "fit as a fiddle" (t
7.45).  It was because of this reaction he started to wear a mask when using
glue in confined spaces but never thought that when
he used glue "out in the
trenches" and the fresh air that it would harm anyone.  
<P>

(11)	The plaintiff then contacted Dr Klein and told him of his experience.  Dr
Klein made enquiries at Newcastle University regarding
exotic and chemical
diseases and the question of Lyme disease was discussed.  The plaintiff then
attended Dr Bernie Hudson a specialist
in Lyme disease who concluded that he
was not suffering from this disease.
<P>

(12)	During 1992 the plaintiff became aware for the first time that labels on
the tins of glue had been changed to add a directions
to "avoid breathing
vapour" and to include details of the chemical, methyl-ethyl ketone.  After
becoming aware of these directions
the plaintiff began wearing a mask at all
times.  Due to the poor state of his health the plaintiff employed an assistant
plumber
and told him to be careful using the solvent in a confined space but it
"can't hurt you that much".  It was then he looked at a can
and observed that
there was a warning on it.  The warning says:
<P>

<center><b>"SAFETY DIRECTIONS</b>
<P>

<b>Irritant - Avoid contact with skin and eyes.</b>
<P>

<b>Avoid breathing vapour.</b>
<P>

<b>NOT TO BE TAKEN"</b></center>
<P>


<P>

This warning did not strengthen the plaintiff's belief that there was a
connection between exposure and the symptoms.  
<P>

(13)	Between September 1992 and 8 April 1993 the plaintiff was referred to Dr
Michael Prowse, Dr Blackie and Dr Christie.  They
did not link the plaintiff's
symptomatology to an organic cause.
<P>

(14)	In December 1993 the plaintiff consulted Dr Joachim Fluhrer at the Sydney
Natural Medical Centre at Manly who referred the
plaintiff to Newcastle
University to undergo testing.  In December 1993 Dr Fluhrer told the plaintiff
that "its not all in your head"
and that the tests revealed an association
between his symptoms and exposure to chemicals such as PVC glue.  At this stage
the plaintiff
gave evidence that he did not know for sure it was the solvents
that were causing his symptoms.  However, the explanation came as
a great
relief to him because since 1978 no-one had provided him with a cause of his
problem.  Dr Fluhrer told him that he had suffered
permanent damage.
<P>

(15)	Dr Fluhrer referred the plaintiff to the WorkCover Authority for tests and
a second opinion.  These tests were carried out
by Dr Richard Teo.  In August
1994 Dr Teo advised the plaintiff that he should not still be on this planet
and that there was no
treatment that could cure him.  Based on what Dr Teo told
the plaintiff he had no doubt in his mind that it was the solvents that
caused
his injury (t 10.50).  Dr Teo also told the plaintiff to sue the
manufacturers.
<P>

(16)	The plaintiff was treated by Dr Fluhrer once a week for approximately 16
months.  Dr Fluhrer referred the plaintiff to Dr Mark
Donohoe at Mosman.
<P>

(17)	On 26 October 1994 the plaintiff consulted Dr Donohoe.  Dr Donohoe advised
the plaintiff to sue and gave him the name of a
solicitor, Mr Bill Madden of
Blessington Judd.  Dr Donohoe told the plaintiff that he had suffered permanent
neurological damage.
 The plaintiff waited six months before consulting a
solicitor as Dr Donohoe recommended treatment which the plaintiff hoped would
make him well.  Dr Donohoe did not tell the plaintiff what he intended to write
in his report.  However in view of what Dr Teo had
previously told him coupled
with Dr Donohoe's advice there was no doubt in the plaintiff's mind that the
solvents had caused his
injuries.  
<P>

(18)	In early April 1995 the plaintiff consulted Mr Bill Madden, a solicitor
and sought legal advice.
<P>

(19)	Due to illness Dr Donohoe's report was not prepared until 19 May 1995.
The report stated that on the balance of probabilities,
and with due regard to
the history and assessment he was of the opinion that workplace exposure to
solvents (principally the methyl-ethyl
ketone) over a number of years was the
direct cause of his hepatic damage, his neurological abnormalities and his
chronic pain syndrome.
 He was also of the opinion that without such exposure
in the workplace the plaintiff would most likely be in good health today.
<P>

(20)	On 20 December 1996 the statement of claim was filed.
<P>

(21)	In August 1996 the plaintiff first became aware that chemical companies
which manufacture the solvents supply the details of
the chemicals used in the
manufacture.  They would provide the safety data sheets.  The manufacturers
should have included on their
labels for many years warnings of the chemicals
in the solvents. The manufacturers did not pass on to the consumer the details
that
were provided to them by the chemical companies.  A lot of these chemicals
which have caused problems have been around for 30 to
40 years.  He was told
this by Mr Johnny Walker who holds an Associate Diploma of Applied Chemistry
from Royal Melbourne Institute
of Technology.  It was confirmed by Mr Walker in
a letter addressed to the plaintiff and dated 26 September 1996 (Ex A).
<P>

(22)	On 26 May 1997 the plaintiff's current solicitors took over carriage of
this matter.
<P>

(23)	In October 1997 the statement of claim was served on the defendants.
<P>

(24)	On 2 February 1998 the notice of motion to extend the limitation period
was filed.
<P>

<b><u>The Law</u></b>
<P>

5  	The plaintiff relies on s 60G and s 60I(1)(a)(i), (ii) and (iii)
of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b> 1969 (NSW) (as amended).  The approach to be
adopted in dealing with applications for extension of limitation periods is
that which
has been expounded in recent times in <b><u>Brisbane South Regional
Health Authority v Taylor</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186 CLR 541</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=139%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">139 ALR 1</a>, <b><u>BHP
Steel (AIS) Pty Limited v Giudice (&amp; Ors</u>)</b> (NSWCA unreported, 7
March 1997) and <b><u>Council of the City of Sydney v Zegarac</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%2d98%29%2043%20NSWLR%20195" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997-98)
43 NSWLR 195.</a>  The onus rests with the applicant.  In addition to the
satisfying of the relevant threshold requirements, it must be shown that
it is
just and reasonable to make an order.
<P>

<b>Subdivision (3)</b>
<P>

6  	The procedure provided by this group of provisions is available
for causes of action that accrue after 1 September 1990;  but
"also (by the
operation of Schedule 5) for causes of action that accrued before that date" <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60f.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s
60F).</a>
<P>

7  	Schedule 5 provides by clause 4(1) that:
<P>

<b>"Section 60G also applies to a cause of action, founded on negligence,
nuisance or breach of duty, being a cause of action that accrued
or would have
accrued before 1 September 1990...";</b>
<P>

8  	and clause 4(4) empowers the court to make an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a>
in respect of such a cause of action:
<P>

<b>"...if an application for such order is made within:</b>
<P>

<b> (a)	the period of three years referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I</a>;  or</b>
<P>

<b> (b)	the period of three years commencing 1 September 1990."</b>
<P>

9  	The application to extend time was made on 2 February 1998 which
is outside the time stipulated in clause 4(4)(b).  The application
can only
succeed if that date is shown to be "within the period of three years referred
to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I".</a>
<P>

10  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60G</a> empowers the court to extend the limitation period,
if it is just and reasonable to do so, "for such a period as it determines".
<P>

11  	The relevant provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I</a> are as follows:
<P>

<b>"(1)	A court may not make an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60h.html" class="autolink_findacts">60H</a> unless it is satisfied
that:</b>
<P>

<b>  (a)	the plaintiff:</b>
<P>

<b>  (i)	did not know that personal injury had been suffered;  or</b>
<P>

<b> (ii)	was unaware of the nature or extent of personal injury suffered;
or</b>
<P>

<b>(iii)	was unaware of the connection between the personal injury and the
defendant's act or omission,</b>
<P>

<b>at the expiration of the relevant limitation period or at a time before that
expiration when proceedings might reasonably have been
instituted;  and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the application is made within three years after the plaintiff became
aware (or ought to have become aware) of all three matters
listed in paragraph
(a)(i)-(iii)."</b>
<P>

12  	Where it is alleged that as a result of continuing negligence by
a manufacturer the health and well being of the plaintiff
progressively
deteriorates, a new cause of action may arise when the plaintiff suffers
further not insignificant damage to his health
and well being.  Leave is
required for those causes of action that arose up to December 1993.
<P>

13  	Thus to gain access to the beneficial provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a>, the
plaintiff must show that:
<P>

(1)	As at December 1993 (the expiration of the relevant limitation period) he
was unaware of one or more of the matters identified
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)(i)</a>, (ii) or
(iii).
<P>

(2)	That he did not become aware of that or those or he ought to have become
aware in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)</a> (or the last of those matters to become known to him)
earlier than 2 February 1995.
<P>

14  	The practical effect is to require the plaintiff to identify
specifically what fact or facts he claims not to have known in
December 1993,
which lack of knowledge meets the description in one or more of paragraphs (i),
(ii) and (iii) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)</a>;  and to show (by evidence) the date on which he
acquired knowledge thereof (being a date later than 2 February 1995);  or to
show
that that fact was or those facts were still unknown to him on that date.
The defendant did not submit that the plaintiff ought to
have become aware of
the matters listed in paragraphs (i)-(iii) at an earlier date - see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
60I(1)(b).</a>
<P>

15  	Counsel indicated that the plaintiff relied on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)(i)</a>,
(ii) and (iii) but conceded that evidence given by the plaintiff during cross
examination severely qualifies and undermines his
case under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(a)(i)</a> and
(ii). 
<P>

<b> (i)	<u>Whether the plaintiff has proved that "he did not know that a
personal injury had been suffered</u>"</b>
<P>

16  	In 1978 the plaintiff knew he suffered from sore muscles and a
stomach problem.  In 1987 the plaintiff began to get severe
shooting pains in
both arms, sore feet and hands and arm muscles.  He began to have respiratory
problems including chest infections.
 He suspected that there was a connection
between the glue and his symptoms but did not know what the connection was.  In
April 1991
the plaintiff still suspected that there was a connection between
the vapours of the PVC solvent and the symptoms that he was suffering.
 He knew
that when he sniffed the glue it relieved the sudden onset of an episode of
dizziness, rapid heart beat, sweating and blurred
vision.  In December 1993 Dr
Fluhrer told the plaintiff that it was not all in his head and that the tests
revealed an association
between his symptoms and exposure to glue chemicals
such as PVC glue and that he had suffered permanent damage.  In August 1994 Dr
Teo advised the plaintiff that he should not still be on this planet and that
there was no treatment that could cure him.  Dr Teo
advised the plaintiff to
sure the manufacturers.  In August 1994 the plaintiff had no doubt in his mind
that it was the solvents
that caused his injury.  This belief was further
confirmed when the plaintiff was examined by Dr Donohoe in October 1994.
<P>

17  	It is my view that by August 1994 at the latest the plaintiff
knew that he had suffered a personal injury.  The acquisition

<b>(ii)	<u>Whether the plaintiff has proved that he was "unaware of the nature

<P>

18  	The test of knowledge posed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)(ii)</a> requires the
court to look at the actual awareness of the plaintiff.  Neither the
reasonableness of that awareness nor constructive
knowledge is an element of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s

CLR 1</a> at pp 9 and 10).  However, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I</a> (1)(b) imposes an objective test -
"became aware (or ought to have become aware)" of all three matters listed in
paragraphs (a)(i)-(iii).
 The defendant did not submit that the plaintiff
"ought to have known" the nature and extent of his injuries. 
<P>

19  	The nature and extent of the injury which the plaintiff has
sustained is to be determined as at the date of the hearing of
the application
(<b><u>Harris</u></b> ibid pp 13 and 14).  A plaintiff may be held to have been
aware of the nature or extent of his injury within the relevant period
if
during that period he was aware of the effect which the injury was then having
upon him and of its likely future course, even
though he may have been unaware
of the precise pathology or medical diagnosis.  On the other hand, knowledge of
the medical diagnosis
will not itself amount to knowledge of the nature and
extent of the injury if the plaintiff is unaware of significant aspects of
the
prognosis, for example that the injury is permanent and will not be amenable to
treatment;  or that it may deteriorate with the
passage of time.  As long as
the consequences are of a kind that the plaintiff expects, the plaintiff will
be aware of the extent
of the injury.
<P>

20  	For the reasons given above, by August 1994 the plaintiff knew
that he was suffering from chemical sensitivity which symptoms
included sore
muscles which felt like he had played football the day before, severe shooting
pain in both arms, sore feet and hands,
respiratory problems including chest
infections, increased heart rate, blurred vision, sweating and dizziness.  He
knew that the
damage he had suffered was permanent.  It is appreciated that in
October 1994 the plaintiff was optimistic that Dr Donohoe's treatment
may make
him well but this does not mean that he was not aware that he had suffered
permanent damage.  It is my view that by August
1994 the plaintiff was aware of
the nature and extent of the personal injury he had suffered.  The plaintiff
acquired this knowledge
outside the period stipulated by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(b)</a> and the

<P>

<b>(iii)	<u>Whether the plaintiff was unaware of the connection between
personal injury and the defendant's act or omission</u>?</b>
<P>

21  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60I(1)(a)(iii)</a> is concerned with ignorance of the
existence of acts and omissions rather than legal conclusions.  The acts or
omissions referred
to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)(iii)</a> are the acts or omissions on which
the plaintiff relies to found the cause of action referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G.</a>  Those
acts or omissions, will be found in the plaintiff's particulars of negligence.
-  <b><u>Drayton Coal Board Pty Limited v Drain</u></b> (NSWCA, Gleeson CJ,
unreported 22 August 1995).
<P>

22  	The plaintiff submitted that he was unaware of the connection
between the personal injury and the defendant's acts or omissions
until August
1996 when he was told that the manufacturers should have included a warning
label on their PVC solvent containers. 
The defendants submitted that the
plaintiff knew of the warnings on the containers in 1992 and had worn a mask in
1991.
<P>

23  	In 1992 due to the poor state of his health the plaintiff had to
employ a plumber and told him to be careful using the solvent
but it "can't
hurt you that much".  At that time the plaintiff became aware for the first
time that labels on the tins of glue had
been changed to add a direction to
"avoid breathing vapour" and to include details of the chemical, methyl-ethyl
ketone.  After becoming
aware of these directions the plaintiff began wearing a
mask at all times.  The warning did not strengthen the plaintiff's belief
that
there was a connection between exposure and the symptoms. He was careful using
the solvent in confined spaces but never thought
that it would harm anyone "out
in the trenches".
<P>

24  	In August 1996 the plaintiff first became aware that chemical
companies which manufacture the solvents supply the details of
the chemicals
used in the manufacture.  Details of the chemical compounds were provided in
safety data sheets.  In August 1996 the
plaintiff became aware that they should
have included on their labels warnings of the chemicals in the solvents and
that the manufacturers
did not pass on to the consumer the details that were
provided to them by the chemical companies.  He was told this by Mr Johnny
Walker who holds an Associate Diploma of Applied Chemistry from Royal Melbourne
Institute of Technology.  It was confirmed by Mr
Walker in writing to the
plaintiff on 26 September 1996 (Ex A).  
<P>

25  	In October 1996 the statement of claim pleaded as one of the
particulars of negligence, the lack of warning.  Particulars of
negligence in
the statement of claim pleaded that the defendants failed to give the plaintiff
any adequate warning that fumes from
the industrial glues were dangerous to
humans and any or any adequate warning that the plaintiff should avoid exposure
to fumes from
the industrial glues and could do so by the use of masks.
Although the plaintiff knew that a warning appeared on the containers of
solvent it was not until after August 1996 that the plaintiff became aware that
the manufacturers should have included on their labels
warnings of the
chemicals in the solvents and that this constituted an omission which would
found a cause of action.
<P>

26  	As the plaintiff has passed through the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I(1)(a)(iii)</a>
gateway, I turn to consider whether it is just and reasonable to extend the
limitation period.  
<P>

<b><u>Just and reasonable</u></b>
<P>

27  	The nature of the discretion conferred by s 31(2) of the
Queensland Limitations Act was considered by the High Court in
<b><u>Taylor</u></b>.  Section 31(2) is almost identical to s 58(2) of the New
South Wales <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a>.  The Court of Appeal has applied
<b><u>Taylor</u></b> in relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> in <b><u>BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Limited
v Giudice</u>;  <u>Commonwealth of Australia v McLean</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2014%20NSWLR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 14 NSWLR
389.</a>
<P>

28  	The defendants concede that the plaintiff has a real case to
advance.  There is medical evidence to support the plaintiff's
claim that his
injuries are linked to the exposure to solvents.  There is medical evidence of
the second and third defendant to the
contrary.  This will be the subject of
dispute at trial, should one occur.
<P>

29  	I turn to consider the effects of delay.  In
<b><u>Taylor</u></b> McHugh J referred to the effects of delay in the now often
quoted passage at p 8 which states:
<P>

<b>"The effect of delay on the quality of justice is no doubt one of the most
important influences motivating a legislature to enact
limitation periods for
commencing actions.  But it is not the only one.  Courts and commentators have
perceived four broad rationales
for the enactment of limitation periods.
First, as time goes by, relevant evidence is likely to be lost.  Secondly, it
is oppressive,
even "cruel", to a defendant to allow an action to be brought
long after the circumstances which gave rise to it have passed.  Thirdly,
people should be able to arrange their affairs and utilise their resources on
the basis that claims can no longer be made against
them.  Insurers, public
institutions and businesses, particularly limited liability companies, have a
significant interest in knowing
that they have no liabilities beyond a definite
period."</b>
<P>

30  	McHugh J at p 10 continued:
<P>

<b>"The discretion to extend should therefore be seen as requiring the
applicant to show that his or her case is a justifiable exception
to the rule
that the welfare of the State is best served by the limitation period in
question. Accordingly, when an applicant seeks
an extension of time to commence
an action after a limitation period has expired, he or she has the positive
burden of demonstrating
that the justice of the case requires that
extension."</b>
<P>

31  	and at page 11 he continued:
<P>

<b>"Legislatures enact limitation periods because they make a judgment, inter
alia, that the chance of an unfair trial occurring after
the limitation period
has expired is sufficiently great to require the termination of the plaintiff's
right of action at the end
of that period.  When a defendant is able to prove
that he or she will not now be able to fairly defend him or herself or that
there
is a significant chance that this is so, the case is no longer one of
presumptive prejudice.  The defendant has then proved what
the legislature
merely presumed would be the case.  Even on the hypothesis of presumptive
prejudice, the legislature perceives that
society is best served by barring the
plaintiff's action.  When actual prejudice of a significant kind is shown, it
is hard to conclude
that the legislature intended that the extension provision
should trump the limitation period.  In such a situation, actual injustice
to
one party must occur.  It seems more in accord with the legislative policy
underlying limitation periods that the plaintiff's
lost right should not be
revived than that the defendant should have a spent liability reimposed upon
it."</b>
<P>

32  	Toohey and Gummow JJ (in their joint judgment) expressed
themselves in the following terms.
<P>

<b>"The real question is whether the delay has made the chances of a fair trial
unlikely.  If it has not there is no reason why the discretion
should not be
exercised in favour of the respondent."</b>
<P>

33  	As was stated in <b><u>Still v Newman</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCA 43</a>
per Fitzgerald JA that the principles in <b><u>Taylor</u></b> and the approach
to be adopted is that while a prospective defendant might have an evidentiary
onus to raise any considerations telling
against the grant of leave, the
applicant bears the onus of showing that justice required the grant of leave,
and must at least show
that the prima facie prejudice to a prospective
defendant, or any specific prejudice demonstrated, are not so significant that
a
fair trial is unlikely.  Unless an application demonstrates that, despite the
delay and other circumstances of prejudice to the defendant,
the defendant will
have a fair trial, leave should be refused.
<P>

34  	In <b><u>Zegarac</u></b> the Court of Appeal referred to a
balancing exercise of the respective prejudices to one party or the other
depending on whether
leave was refused or granted which was described as
"unhelpful and misleading".
<P>

35  	The plaintiff submitted that the defendants would not suffer
from presumptive prejudice because the case involves only a failure
to warn of
the dangers of the solvent and there is evidence to show that there were no
warnings on the solvent cans until 1992. 
However this submission is based on
the plaintiff's knowledge that a warning was affixed on containers produced by
one manufacturer
in relation to one brand of solvent.  I do not think that it
is that simple.  The defendants will be obliged to investigate when
they
actually put warnings on their containers.  They will also have to investigate
what was known about those particular solvents
since 1978 to 1994 and locate
the safety data sheets during that period.  The defendants did not put on any
evidence to show that
they suffered actual prejudice.
<P>

36  	According to the plaintiff witnesses' memories would not need to
be relied upon.  For the defendant to locate records and investigate
what was
known about solvents at particular times may in part rely on witnesses'
memories.  The doctors' records of treatment and
diagnosis of the plaintiff
have been subpoenaed, produced and are available.  The plaintiff purchased his
supplies for 30 years from
Raynor Plumbing Supplies at Girraween and later Port
Macquarie.  Additionally he purchased material from Coleman Plumbing Supplies
at either Taree or Forster.  The entities from which he purchased the solvent
are relatively few and have been identified by the
plaintiff.  Once again the
location of old records and witnesses' memories come into play when the
defendants prepare their cases
for trial.
<P>

37  	The defendants submitted that in considering whether it is just
and reasonable regard should be had to the plaintiff's firm
state of knowledge
in 1993 and 1994 of the connection between his symptoms and the chemical
exposure to solvents and the delay in
prosecuting these proceedings.  In
October 1994 the plaintiff was told by Dr Fluhrer to consult a solicitor.  This
did not occur
until April 1995 but I accept the plaintiff's explanation that
even though he had been told he had some permanent damage he was receiving
treatment which may have made him well.  However there has been a delay from
April 1995 when he first consulted a solicitor to 20
December 1996 when the
statement of claim was filed.  The plaintiff's legal representative received
the report of Dr Donohoe about
one month after he was instructed.  This delay
of 18 months had not adequately been explained.  Nor had the period of 10
months between
20 December 1996 to October 1997 when service of the statement
of claim was effected.  
<P>

38  	The notice of motion was not filed until 2 February 1998, nearly
over three years after the statement of claim was filed. 
The plaintiff
submitted that it did not need to trouble the court unnecessarily with this
application until the defendants raised
the limitation period in their
defences.  However no defences have been filed to date.  It is most unlikely
that the defendants would
have waived this defence as the cause of action dates
back up to 20 years.  It is appreciated that the blame for the delay in
prosecuting
the proceedings once they were commenced may rest at the feet of
the plaintiff's solicitors and the plaintiff may not be personally
to blame.
<P>

39  	The defendants will suffer significant prejudice as it is up to
20 years since the causes of action arose.  The plaintiff had
firm knowledge in
1993 and 1994 that his symptoms were connected to the exposure to solvents and
there have been periods of unexplained
delay in prosecuting these proceedings.
It is my view that the chances of a fair trial are unlikely.  The plaintiff has
not discharged
the onus as I am not satisfied that it is just and reasonable to
extend the limitation period.  Costs should follow the event.  The
plaintiff
should pay the defendants' costs.
<P>

40  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff's notice of motion filed 2 February 1998 is dismissed.
<P>

(2)	The plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs.
