<b>4235/98	RE BAGOMBA PASTORAL COMPANY PTY LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) and THE
CORPORATIONS LAW</b>
<P>

<b>APPLICATION OF GREGORY PAUL KELLY IN HIS CAPACITY AS LIQUIDATOR OF BAGOMBA
PASTORAL COMPANY PTY LTD (IN LIQUIDATION)</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>His Honour:</b>
<P>

1   	Mr Paul Conway, solicitor, has appeared this morning in
answer to an order recently made by me under s 597(9) of the Corporations
Law
("the Law") to produce documents.  There had been an earlier order to the same
effect.  There was earlier a deal of controversy
and difficulty over the
production of the documents.  Under the order made by me a considerable
quantity of documents has been produced
to the Court.  This morning a further
smaller number of documents, in a single orange folder, has been produced and
added to the
documents already held in the custody of the Court.  Mr Dowdy, of
counsel for the liquidator, has applied for access to the documents.
 The
documents are required for the purposes of an examination under s 597 before a
Registrar of this Court of certain persons, including
officers of the company
in liquidation.
<P>

2   	The documents ordered to be produced by Mr Conway are
documents held by him as solicitor acting for the company and for certain
members of the Headon family who are associated with the company.  Mr Conway
has claimed a lien for costs over the documents in relation
to his acting for
the company and those members of the Headon family.  No evidence has been laid
before me of what costs are outstanding
to him, and by whom, which would
provide the factual basis for the existence of such a lien.  However, I need
not get into the question
of whether a lien in fact exists, or the extent to
which a lien must be established before it is given effect to by the Court in
circumstances such as the present, for reasons which appear hereafter in this
judgment.
<P>

3   	Mr Conway initially sought not to produce the documents
claimed to be held under the lien to the Court at all.  I peremptorily
ordered
him to produce the documents to the Court, but on the basis that they would be
held in the custody of the Court and no access
would be granted to any person
until his point about the lien had been debated.  That has been debated this
morning on the application
by Mr Dowdy on behalf of liquidator to have access
to the documents.  In support of his argument that the documents should not be
required to be produced to the Court at all, and that access certainly ought
not be granted to the liquidator, Mr Conway has relied
upon the decision of the
Court of Appeal in <b>Bolster v McCallum</b> (1966) 85 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 281 and
particularly what was said by Jacobs JA in a passage that runs from the bottom
of 283 to the top
of 284.
<P>

4   	Mr Dowdy presses his application for access relying on  two
bases, first, s 597 and, secondly, the common law.  He says, first
and
primarily, that the terms of s 597 (10) of the Law make it plain that, whatever
the common law may have been, or may be, relating
to the production on subpoena
of documents the subject of a lien and restriction on their use  when produced,
it is the intention
of the legislature that such documents be produced and
their proper use permitted on examinations under the Law.  If this argument
be
correct, the terms of that subsection itself make it plain that the production
and use do not of themselves destroy the lien.
 In support of that
interpretation of the section, Mr Dowdy has drawn my attention to the decision
of Williams J in the Supreme Court
of Queensland in<b> Re Electronic Learning
Systems International Pty Ltd (In Liq)</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%202%20QdR%20144" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 2 QdR 144.</a>  What Mr Dowdy has
put to me appears to me correct, from my reading of the statute.  And this is
supported by the decision of Williams
J, which respectfully appears to me to be
entirely correct in this regard.
<P>

5   	It is probably not necessary, in those circumstances, for
me to deal with the common law situation.  However, what was said
by Jacobs JA
about the common law position in the passage referred to above must be read in
light of the fact that the decision of
the Court of Appeal was that the lien
must yield to the dictates of justice and that the District Court Judge
appealed from was wrong
in not compelling production of and allowing access to
the documents:  see per Jacobs JA lower on 284 and Asprey JA at 286-7.  Walsh
JA at 282 agreed with Asprey JA.  The production, however, should be ordered
subject to such conditions as can be modelled best to
protect the lien.  This
course is also endorsed and followed in other authorities that Mr Conway has
cited to me: <b> In the Marriage of Rhode; Borthwick, Butler and Yee
intervening</b>, (1983) 9 FamLR 159;<b> R v Storer</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20111%20FLR%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 111 FLR 243</a>
and<b> Hammerstone Pty Ltd v Lewis</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%202%20QdR%20267" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] 2 QdR 267.</a>  However, as I say, in
my view, I do not have to act under the common law because the statutory regime
created by the Law prevails.
<P>

6   	Just as at common law steps were taken to protect the lien
so far as possible, in my view, the lien should similarly be protected
where
production is ordered under s 597.  Mr Dowdy does not dispute this, and for
that reason it is not necessary, for present purposes,
to investigate to what
degree the lien is established or is required to be established; Mr Dowdy is
prepared, on behalf of his client,
to accommodate the situation by agreeing to
measures to protect the lien on the basis that the claim is made.  Indeed, it
may be
relevant for subsequent purposes to record that Mr Dowdy states that his
client has at all times been ready to come to a sensible
accommodation on this
subject matter.  I indicated to Mr Dowdy that I thought that the protection
that should be given was to the
general effect that, when access is had to the
documents, only such documents should be copied as are necessary for use upon
the
examinations already mentioned; that those copies should be used only for
the purposes of those examinations; and that the liquidator
should not provide
copies of any of the documents to any other person, or allow any other person
further to copy them.  On the basis
of that indication by me, conditions of
access have been agreed and have been embodied in short minutes of order.
<P>

7   	I should say that before access can be had, a separate
argument remains to be raised on behalf of members of the Headon family,
who
object to access on the ground that they claim legal professional privilege in
the documents, or some of them, but that claim
is to be determined separately
and arrangements have been made for its determination.  Costs are sought on
behalf of the liquidator
against Mr Conway personally.  Those costs are sought
under Pt 42 r 7 of the Supreme Court Rules against Mr Conway in his guise as
a
person the subject of an order for production.  Arrangements will be made for
the further argument of that question of costs.
<P>

8   	It remains only for me to dispose of the matter for the
present by making orders in accordance with the short minutes initialled
by me
and placed with the papers.  Full answer has not yet been made to the order for
production of the documents.  The matter is
again before me at 10 o'clock next
Wednesday, 8 September 1999 for further answer to the order to produce and I
shall, at that time,
make an appointment for the hearing of the costs
argument.
<P>
