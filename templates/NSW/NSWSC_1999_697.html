<b><u>012891/98 - PALMER v BLUE CIRCLE SOUTHERN CEMENT LTD</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	<b>HER HONOUR:</b>    This is an appeal by way of Stated
Case against the determination of Mr Price, Magistrate, given on 11 June 1998.

<P>

2   	In the proceedings before the Magistrate, the respondent to
the present appeal sought to recover the sum of $10,998.20 which
had been paid
to the appellant in the period 16 September 1986 to 16 May 1988 pursuant to an
award made by the Compensation Court
of New South Wales on 8 June 1983.  On 16
May 1998 that award was terminated with effect from 17 September 1986 by
further order
of the Compensation Court.  In the proceedings before the Local
Court the respondent contended that the payments in the period 16
September
1986 to 16 May 1988 had been made under "a mistake of fact and/or law".
<P>

3   	The Magistrate gave judgment for the respondent in the sum
of $10,998.20.  
<P>

4   	I set out below the facts as found by the Magistrate and
recited in the Stated Case relevant to the issues in the way the matter
was
developed before me:
<P>

(a)	An award was made by his Honour Judge Williams on 8 June 1983 in the
Compensation Court of New South Wales in favour of the
defendant who was then
the applicant against the plaintiff, who was then the respondent.  The award
was entered on a continuing basis
at the time due to the applicant worker's
partial incapacity to continue employment as a truck driver.  
<P>

(b)	On 16 May 1988 Turner C in the Compensation Court terminated the award as
from 17 September 1986 and the plaintiff was to have
no further liability from
that date.  
<P>

(c)	NEM General Insurance Association Ltd (In Liquidation) who were the
insurers of the plaintiff had paid during the period 16
September 1986 and 16
May 1988 payments to the defendant totalling $10,998.20 gross being 86.6 weeks
at $127 per week.  
<P>

(g)	The defendant, prior to receipt of the workers' compensation payments in
1983, received sickness benefits.  
<P>

(h)	Following the termination of the award by Turner C on 16 May 1988 he was
paid an invalid pension.
<P>

(i)	The defendant did not receive either sickness benefits nor an invalid
pension for the period 16 September 1986 to 16 May 1988
as he was in receipt of
workers' compensation benefits.  
<P>

(j)	Had he not been in receipt of workers' compensation payments the defendant
would have applied for and received during the period
referred to either
sickness benefits or an invalid pension.  
<P>

(k)	The defendant is now barred from claiming those Commonwealth benefits or
pension for the period referred to.  
<P>

5   	The Magistrate, inter alia, made the following
determinations:
<P>

(2)	In making the payments to the defendant the subject of the plaintiff's
claim, the plaintiff was endeavouring to satisfy the
award made by Williams J
on 8 June 1983.  The plaintiff had a conscious but mistaken understanding of
its legal obligation to pay
and of the defendant's legal right to receive the
money.
<P>

(3)	(i)	The defendant was enriched when he was paid workers' compensation.
<P>

	(ii)	The monies which the defendant received from the plaintiff were spent by
the defendant on ordinary living expenses.  The defendant
had not established
the defence of change of position.  
<P>

(4)	The defendant had not suffered any prejudice as a result of the plaintiff's
delay and had had the benefit of the award monies
for a longer period then he
otherwise would have done.  The plaintiff was not barred by laches from
claiming the relief sought. 

<P>

(5)	The delay on the plaintiff's part amounted to no more than a silence which
was equivocal.  There was no induced reliance that
was prejudicial to the
defendant and no unconscionable conduct on the part of the plaintiff.  The
plaintiff was not estopped from
claiming the relief sought.
<P>

6   	The Stated Case contains three grounds upon which it is
contended that the Magistrate's determination was erroneous in point
of law:
<P>

(1)	That I was in error in law in holding that the Local Court has jurisdiction
to hear and determine this claim, in that inter
alia I misinterpreted the
effect of Schedule 6 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/index.html#p4" class="autolink_findacts">Part 4</a> Clause 13 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers' Compensation Act</a></b>
1987.  
<P>

(2)	That I was in error in law in holding that the subject monies had been paid
under a mistake of fact or law.
<P>

(3)	That I was in error in law in holding that the defence of change of
position had not been made out.
<P>

7   	Contention (1) was not pressed in the proceedings before
me.
<P>

8   	The principal challenge to the Magistrate's determination
advanced on the hearing of the Stated Case was as to contention (3),
namely,
the Magistrate's determination that the defence of change of position had not
been made out.
<P>

9   	Mr McManamey who appeared for the appellant submitted that
contention (2) was "ultimately a pleading point".  Mr McManamey
did not seek to
contend that the respondent did not have a claim on general restitutionary
principles.  However, he noted that the
respondent had pleaded its case as one
involving the payment of monies under a mistake of fact or law.  Mr McManamey
submitted that
there was no mistake of fact or law disclosed by the facts found
by the Magistrate.  The respondent had made payments pursuant to
a valid award.
There was no mistake of fact or law at the time the payments were advanced.
Reliance was placed in this regard on
the observations of Abadee J in <b>G H
Varley Pty Ltd v Thompson</b> (unreported, NSWSC, 25 February 1998).  
<P>

10   	Mr Ellison who appeared for the respondent submitted that
the case had been conducted on a practical basis where the issue
litigated was
one of restitution arising out of the unjust enrichment of the appellant.
Nothing turned on the way the matter had
been pleaded and the appellant had not
been taken by surprise.
<P>

11   	I note that in <b>Melesco Manufacturing Pty Ltd v
Thompson</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%20525" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR 525</a> the majority held that an employer might
recover payments made under an award subsequently varied to nil in a claim for
restitution
before the Local Court.  In <b>Melesco</b> the award was varied by
consent. The  consent orders included provision that the employer have credit
for amounts of compensation
paid to date.  Whatever the significance of that
might be no submission was advanced before me that, subject to the appellant's
defence,
the respondent did not have a prima facie entitlement to recover the
over-payment. 
<P>

12   	In the light of Mr McManamey's concession that the
respondent had a valid claim by reference to restitutionary principles
(subject
to the appellant's defence of change of position) I accept the force of Mr
Ellison's submission that in the way this matter
was conducted there is no
merit to the pleading point.  
<P>

13   	The third contention advanced by the appellant is that the
Magistrate erred in holding that the defence of change of position
had not been
made out.  The Magistrate found that the monies received by the plaintiff were
expended on ordinary living expenses.
 No challenge is made to this aspect of
the Magistrate's determination.  
<P>

14   	Mr McManamey submits that the Magistrate misdirected
himself in that he appears to have considered that the appellant's failure
to
apply for and receive Department of Social Security benefits during the subject
period was not capable of giving rise to a defence
of change of position.  It
was Mr McManamey's submission that throughout the period of receipt of the
workers' compensation payments
the appellant had foregone his entitlement to
receive social security payments.  Had he not received the weekly payments
pursuant
to the award made by Williams J, he would have received benefits from
the Department of Social Security.  He was not now able to
make any claim on
the Department of Social Security in respect of the subject period.  The change
of position was the non receipt
of social security benefits in reliance on the
receipt of payments under the award and not the expenditure of the monies
received
on ordinary living expenses.  In those circumstances it would be
unjust to require the appellant to repay the monies. 
<P>

15   	Mr Ellison submitted that contention (3) did not raise an
error of law.  The Magistrate's factual findings included reference
to the
circumstance that the appellant had foregone his entitlement to social security
payments together with the evidence which
disclosed that the workers'
compensation monies had been applied on ordinary living expenses.  The
Magistrate had found that the
defence of change of position had not been made
out.  This was a factual finding not open to review in proceedings by way of
Stated
Case. 
<P>

16   	This is an appeal by way of Stated Case brought pursuant
to s 69(3) <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Courts (Civil Claims) Act</a></b> 1970.  Such an appeal is
confined to errors of law.  Mr Ellison referred me to <b>Azzopardi v Tasman UEB
Industries Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%204%20NSWLR%20139" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 4 NSWLR 139</a> and, in particular, to the observations
of Glass JA at 155:
<P>

"To say of a finding that it is perverse, that it is contrary to the
overwhelming weight of the evidence, that it is against the
evidence and the
weight of the evidence, that it ignores the probative force of the evidence
which is all one way or that no reasonable
person could have made it, is to say
the same thing in different ways.  Upon proof that the finding of a jury is
vitiated in this
way, it will be set aside because it is wrong in fact.  Since
the Act does not allow this court to correct errors of fact, any argument
that
the finding of a Workers' Compensation Commission judge is vitiated in the same
way discloses no error of law and will not constitute
a valid ground of
appeal."
<P>

17   	No complaint is made as to the Magistrate's findings of
fact. It is contended that those findings are susceptible of a different
conclusion in law if the principles as to the defence of change of position are
as Mr McManamey submits.  It is not a case of the
Magistrate having arrived at
findings of fact said to be contrary to the weight of the evidence.  Rather,
that he appears not to
have considered those facts as capable of constituting a
defence to the respondent's claim. In this sense it is contended that he
must
be taken to have misdirected himself; <b>Azzopardi</b> at p.156.  
<P>

18   	In para 3(ii) the Magistrate expresses his determination
in terms consistent with an observation made by the majority in <b>David
Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 48</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 353</a> at
386:
<P>

"In no jurisdiction, however, can a defendant resort to the defence of change
of position where he or she has simply spent the money
received on ordinary
living expenses."
<P>

I should note that by agreement between the parties I was supplied with a copy
of the Magistrate's reasons for judgment delivered
on 11 June 1998.
<P>

19   	It is the appellant's contention that the Magistrate erred
in that he considered the finding that the award monies had been
spent on
ordinary living expenses was conclusive of the change of position defence.
Having regard to his favourable factual findings
as to the appellant's decision
not to apply for social security benefits in reliance on the receipt of the
award monies, it is an
irresistible inference that the Magistrate did not
consider this alternative basis as admitting of a defence of change of
position.
 
<P>

20   	I was not referred to any authority which would support
the proposition that a defence of change of position might be made
out by
evidence that the recipient of the subject monies had foregone his or her
entitlement to make a claim on another source. 
Mr McManamey submitted that the
broad statement of principle to be found in the judgment of the majority in
<b>David Securities </b>(at 385) was a sufficient basis to found the defence:

<P>

"If we accept the principle that payments made under a mistake of law should be
prima facie recoverable, in the same way as payments
made under a mistake of
fact, a defence of change of position is necessary to ensure that enrichment of
the recipient of the payment
is prevented only in circumstances where it would
be <i>unjust</i>.  This does not mean that the concept of unjust enrichment
needs to shift the primary focus of its attention from the moment of
enrichment.
 From the point of view of the person making the payment, what
happens after he or she has mistakenly paid over the money is irrelevant,
for
it is at that moment that the defendant is unjustly enriched.  However, the
defence of change of position is relevant to the
enrichment of the defendant
precisely because its central element is that the defendant has acted to his or
her detriment on the
<i>faith of the receipt</i>."
<P>

21   	Mr McManamey also relied on a passage in the judgment of
Dawson J in <b>David</b> <b>Securities </b>appearing at pp.405-6:
<P>

"The tentative acceptance of change of position as a defence to a claim for
restitution may now I think be stated more positively
in the light of the
decision of the House of Lords in <b>Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%202%20AC%20548" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 2
AC 548.</a>  As Lord Goff of Chieveley observed in that case, it is basic to the
concept of unjust enrichment that `where an innocent defendant's
position is so
changed that he will suffer an injustice if called upon to repay or to repay in
full, the injustice of requiring him
so to repay outweighs the injustice of
denying the plaintiff restitution'.  Whilst unjust enrichment does not of
itself constitute
a cause of action, it provides a `unifying legal concept' and
serves to mark out the defences to claims in restitution."
<P>

22   	As Mr McManamey submitted, the law with respect to
restitution and the defence of change of position is in a developing state.
 In
the passage immediately following the broad statement of principle for which he
contends the majority make reference to the scope
of the defence in Canada and
the United States:
<P>

"[T]he defence operates in different ways but the common element in all cases
is the requirement that the defendant point to expenditure
or financial
commitment which can be ascribed to the mistaken payment.  In Canada and in
some United States decisions, the defendant
has been required to point to
<i>specific</i> expenditure being incurred because of the payment.  Other cases
in the United States allow a wider scope to the defence, such that
a defendant
can rely upon it even though he or she cannot precisely identify the
expenditure caused by the mistaken payments."
<P>

23   	The appellant does not point to expenditure or financial
commitment which might be ascribed to the award payments.  He relies
on the
detriment that he made no claim to payment from the Department of Social
Security.  I have been able to locate few authorities
which support the
proposition that a detriment, other than the expenditure of the monies
mistakenly paid (on items other than ordinary
living expenses) constitutes a
change of position for the purpose of the defence.  
<P>

24   	In <b>The Council of the City of Sydney v Burns Philp
Trustee Company Ltd (In Liquidation) &amp; Anor</b> (unreported, NSWSC, Com D,
13 November 1992) Rogers CJ Com D considered the scope of the defence of change
of position in the light
of the decision in <b>David Securities </b>which had
just been handed down. In that case the provisions of a lease between the
Council as lessor and the Trustee Company as lessee
provided that rent should
be determined as a fixed percentage of the "unimproved land value" of the
premises. In the event that the
concept of "unimproved land value" was
abandoned in the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/vola173/" class="autolink_findacts">Valuation of Land Act</a></b> a clause in the lease made
provision for the parties to appoint a valuer to determine the valuation of the
land. The concept of "unimproved
land value" was abandoned. The Valuer General
thereafter issued assessments as to the "land value" of the premises. Both
parties
to the lease acted for a number of years on the assumption that the
latter was synonymous with "unimproved land value".  Giles J
in related
proceedings found this assumption to be wrong. The Trustee Company brought a
cross claim for recovery of overpayments
of rent.  Rogers CJ Com D accepted
that the Council had changed its position to its detriment by not obtaining a
private valuation.
 This entitled the Council to defeat the prima facie right
to restitution to the extent of the detriment suffered by reason of that
change
of position (p.21).
<P>

25   	In <b>Killham v Banque Nationale de Paris</b> (unreported,
Supreme Court of Victoria, Com D, unreported, 28 June 1994) Hedigan J
considered that the defendant bank would have
a defence to a claim in
restitution against it arising out of its assignment of its security.  His
Honour said this:
<P>

"Firstly, the assignment of the debenture itself constituted some alteration in
position because the bank gave up its security.
 That security, in my judgment,
must have at least realised, if exercised, the amount of the overpayment namely
approximately $244,000.
 ...  Its change of position in that respect was that
instead of exercising its powers under the debenture, which I conclude would
have enabled it to recover its debt, it would, if the plaintiff succeeded, be
obliged to return the overpayment.  In my judgment
this constitutes a change of
position with detriment.  It has never been argued by the plaintiff that the
monies were not lawfully
due to the bank."
<P>

26   	It should be noted that his Honour's observations in this
regard were obiter.  In the event, the plaintiff's claim in that
case
failed.
<P>

27   	In <b>Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York v
Outerbridge</b> (1990) 66 DLR (4th) p.517, Osborne J in the Ontario High Court
of Justice considered the change of position defence in a case in
which the
defendant's bank had mistakenly credited the sum of $150,000 to his account.
The defendant was a solicitor.  He believed
that the sum had been paid into his
account on behalf of a client.  Acting on the strength of that belief he had
handed over his
files with respect to that client to new counsel believing that
his account had been paid in full.  Osborne J reviewed the authorities
concerning the defence of change of position.  In particular, he referred to
the judgment of Goff J in <b>Barclays Bank Ltd v W J Simms Son &amp; Cooke
(Southern) Ltd </b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%203%20All%20ER%20522" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 3 All ER 522</a> at 535 together with a number of
Canadian authorities and concluded (at 551):
<P>

"[I]f the defendant has changed his position so that it would be inequitable to
require him to make restitution, then restitution
will not be ordered."
<P>

His Honour went on to observe that the mere fact that the money or benefit
conferred by the mistake has been spent is not sufficient
to amount to a change
in position, and in this respect he cited <b>Rural Municipality of Storthoaks v
Mobil Oil Canada Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%2055%20DLR%20%283d%29%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 55 DLR (3d) 1</a> and <b>Hydro Electric Com'n of
Township of Nepean v Ontario Hydro</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20132%20DLR%20%283d%29%20193" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 132 DLR (3d) 193.</a>  His Honour
accepted that the handing over of the defendant's files to new counsel had
deprived him of the leverage that would have
been immeasurably important in
securing payment of the amount due to him on behalf of the client.  In those
circumstances his Honour
was of the view that it would be inequitable for the
defendant to be required to repay the monies to his bank.  
<P>

28   	I note that <b>Morgan Guaranty</b> was decided before
<b>David Securities</b>  and was not referred by the majority in the course of
a review of the Canadian authorities. As already noted, their Honours commented
on the trend of Canadian and some United States decisions in which the
defendant had been required to point to <i>specific<b> </b></i>expenditure
being incurred because of the payment. 
<P>

29   	In <b>David Securities</b> the majority observed that it
was not appropriate to give a detailed explication of the defence of change of
position (p.386).  They
noted that in <b>Lipkin Gorman</b> it was held that
English law should recognise the defence but, again, its scope had not been
defined.  In that case, Lord Bridge
of Harwich observed (at 558):
<P>

"I agree with my noble and learned friend, Lord Goff of Chieveley, that it is
right for English law to recognise that a claim to
restitution, based on the
unjust enrichment of the defendant, may be met by the defence that the
defendant has changed his position
in good faith.  I equally agree that in
expressly acknowledging the availability of this defence for the first time it
would be unwise
to attempt to define its scope in abstract terms, but better to
allow the law on the subject to develop on a case by case basis."
<P>

30   	Lord Goff expressed the principle underlying the defence
in this way (at 579):
<P>

"In these circumstances, it is right that we should ask ourselves:  why do we
feel that it would be unjust to allow restitution
in cases such as these?  The
answer must be that, where an innocent defendant's position is so changed that
he will suffer an injustice
if called upon to repay or to repay in full, the
injustice of requiring him so to repay outweighs the injustice of denying the
plaintiff
restitution."
<P>

31   	I note that in <b>Restitution Law in Australia</b> (Mason
&amp; Carter, Butterworths, 1995) at para. 2411 it is suggested that the broad
statement of principle quoted above "may be
too flexible a view of the
defence".  
<P>

32   	I return to the principles which emerge from <b>David
Securities</b>.  There is a prima facie right to recovery of monies mistakenly
paid.  The defence of change of position ensures that the enrichment
of the
recipient is prevented only in circumstances where it would be <i>unjust</i>.
The central element of that defence is that the defendant acted to his or her
detriment on the <i>faith of the receipt</i>.  Such a defence is not made out
where the defendant has simply spent the money received on ordinary living
expenses
<P>

33   	In this case there was not one payment but rather over a
period of some 87 weeks the appellant received periodic payments
of $127.  At
the time of the receipt of each payment there was in existence a valid award of
workers' compensation.  On the faith
of the receipt of those periodic payments
throughout the period the appellant did not apply for or receive benefits to
which on the
Magistrate's findings he was entitled.
<P>

34   	The circumstance that the award payments were applied to
meet the appellant's ordinary living expenses seems to me to overlook
the
detriment suffered by the appellant in not claiming social security benefits in
reliance on the receipt of the workers' compensation
payments. 
<P>

35   	The defence of change of position assumes good faith on
the part of the recipient. The Magistrate's findings do not suggest
this was an
issue. Further, there is nothing to suggest that the weekly payments of $127
were in excess of the weekly payments which
the appellant would otherwise have
received in the way of Department of Social Security benefit payments.   
<P>

36   	I consider having regard to the Magistrate's findings and
in particular the finding set out in paragraph 4 (j) above that
the appellant
has made out his defence of change of position within the broad statement of
principle enunciated in <b>David Securities</b>.  
<P>

37   	For these reasons I consider that the Magistrate erred in
law in concluding that the appellant had not established the defence
of change
of position.
<P>

38   	I answer the Stated Case as to contention (3) "Yes".
<P>
