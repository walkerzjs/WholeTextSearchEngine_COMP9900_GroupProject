<P>

1   	What follows is a summation of my reasons for orders
earlier made, in relation to preventing disclosure of a legal opinion
obtained
for the three Plaintiffs, an executive summary of which having reached the
Defendants.  This was in circumstances where,
prima facie, this was without
authority of the First Plaintiff and arguably beyond the authority of the
officer of the Second and
Third Plaintiffs (Mr Meikle) who handed it over to be
read by Mr Garnsey, QC who was advising the Defendants and by Mr Maconochie
a
principal of the First Defendant.  Any legal professional privilege attaching
to the opinion, could not be waived save by all three
Plaintiffs in whom any
privilege resides;  see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s122(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</i> 1995</a> (NSW) and note
the discussion in "Client Legal Privilege and Legal Professional Privilege" by
S B McNichol  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2018%20Australian%20Bar%20Review%20189" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 18 Aust Bar Rev 189</a> at 201-2.
<P>

2   	I should add that I am satisfied that prima facie the legal
opinion also satisfies the hallmarks for the protection of breaches
of
confidence set out in the classical statement of Megarry J in <i>Coco v A N
Clark (Engineers) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%20RPC%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] RPC 41</a> at 47:
<P>

"In my judgment, three elements are normally required if, apart from contract,
a case of breach of confidence is to succeed.  First,
the information itself
... must `have the necessary quality of confidence about it'.  Secondly, that
information must have been imparted
in circumstances importing an obligation of
confidence.  Thirdly, there must have been an unauthorised use of that
information to
the detriment of the party communicating it."
<P>

3   	Whether under the third element detriment is required, is
open to question, though Mason J in <i>Commonwealth v John Fairfax &amp; Sons
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20147%20CLR%2030" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 147 CLR 30</a> at 50-57 concluded that it was an essential
ingredient; per contra R P Meagher, W M C Gummow and J R F Lehane "Equity:
Doctrines
and Remedies 3rd ed (1992) para 4110.  Here I am satisfied the
disclosure has sufficient potential to cause detriment, either in
jeopardising
legal privilege or potentially in seeking advantage in the litigation;  see 12
below.
<P>

4   	I have concluded that the orders that I made yesterday on
an ex parte basis should be continued until further order, subject
to all of
the parties being permitted to apply to the Court on not less than two court
day's notice, it being understood that such
application in the case of the
Defendants may be to seek a variation of the relevant orders.  I have
contemplated qualifying order
3(c) (restraint of the Defendants against
disclosure of the legally privileged advice to officers and employees of the
Plaintiffs)
by a shorter period such as the two court hours embodied in the
original inter partes undertakings. But I conclude that the parties
would not
be assisted, nor court schedules, by a precipitate application in a matter
where those familiar with the relevant issues
would need to be available if
they are to be properly canvassed.  
<P>

5   	I make these orders against a background where a final
hearing should not involve additional evidence so far at least as the
Plaintiffs are concerned and where, with co-operation between the parties and
their legal advisers, an early final hearing should
be achievable, assuming
that the matter is considered to warrant urgency.
<P>

6   	I should briefly deal with one preliminary matter.  It was
contended by the Defendants that the Plaintiffs were unjustified
in proceeding
on an ex parte basis when an agreed interlocutory regime was in place based on
undertakings inter partes.  Furthermore
that the Plaintiffs failed to disclose
all material matters which should have been before the Court when dealing with
the matter
ex parte such that my interim orders should be discharged.  In
particular, it was contended by the Defendants that the Plaintiffs
should have
disclosed to the Court that there was an allegation by the Defendants'
solicitors that the proceedings brought to prevent
disclosure of relevant legal
advice originally by Summons dated 4 August 1999 constituted an abuse of
process.  As I understand the
contention, it was that the proceedings had the
collateral purpose of preventing Mr Garnsey, QC from continuing to represent
the
Defendants.  
<P>

7   	A number of matters were put by the Plaintiffs in response
including that they have at no stage sought to preclude Mr Garnsey,
QC
representing the Defendants.  However, the Defendants press that even if that
were an adequate answer, the existence of that issue,
in proceedings which of
their nature could not resolve that matter in any final way, was nonetheless a
matter of sufficient materiality
to require disclosure.  This was so even
though the application was for orders of a twenty-four hour duration.
<P>

8   	In my view, the case for discharging an ex parte interim
injunction based on non-disclosure of that matter is not such as to
lead me to
take that course.  It is well settled that the Court places great importance on
the obligation to make full and frank
disclosure of all material circumstances
and especially in ex parte matters (see, for example, <i>Kavia Holdings Pty
Limited v Werncog Pty Limited</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/839.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 839 (Santow</a> J, 18 August 1999,
unreported) and <i>Frigo v Culhaci</i> (NSWCA, 17 July 1998, unreported)).
Nonetheless, there is no automatic discharge in the event of non-disclosure
even of matter which
was material or arguably material;  see most recently in
the UK Court of Appeal <i>Marc Rich &amp; Co Holdings GmbH v Krasner</i> (15
January 1999, unreported) and the discussion in "Disclosure Duty of Applicant
for Interim Injunction", in (1999) 18 CJQ 193 at
195.  The position is not
materially different in New South Wales.  I would myself place the
non-disclosure of the matter to which
I have referred as in the arguably
material category and consider that on balance it would have been better it had
been disclosed.
 But as the article earlier cited observes, "the borderline
between material facts and non-material ones may be a somewhat uncertain
one,
particularly in heavy commercial cases".  Nor should the courts encourage the
discharge of otherwise meritorious applications
on the grounds of relatively
trifling errors;  per Timothy Walker J in the English case of <i>Worldcom
International v Home Communications</i> (Timothy Walker J, 16 September 1998,
unreported)  I am therefore satisfied that, considered in context, the
non-disclosure is not
such as to warrant discharge of my ex parte orders.  
<P>

9   	The other matter of non-disclosure is a letter from Mr
Armbruster, the Chief Operating Officer of the Second Plaintiff to Mr
Maconochie, of 14 September 1999.  A reading of the letter however does not in
my view render that letter of sufficient materiality
in the circumstances.
Essentially the Defendants' argument is that the letter points to a context in
which discussions on the business
plan must necessarily deal with the legal
advice the subject of the present litigation.  However, all the letter does is
seeks to
explain the delay in making contact by reference to the current
dispute about the legal advice.  Moreover in the letter's description
of what
occurred in relation to the meeting in August 1998 at which the legal advice
arose, closely tracks what Mr Maconochie had
earlier said in affidavit
evidence;  the word "procured" in the letter hardly carries the degree of
significance attributed to it
by the Defendants.
<P>

10   	I am satisfied the interim orders should continue, having
regard to a number of the concerns raised by the Plaintiffs.  First,
it is
clear that the present inter partes regime carries no court sanction
whatsoever.  It has certainly not inhibited the two reports
in the "Australian"
of 16 September 1999 and 17 September 1999 under the heading "Margin Call",
where a journalist, Mr Michael West,
professes to state the effect of the legal
advice.  I say "professes" because I am not cognisant of the precise advice
given and
do not wish it to be understood that I am concluding that the report
is an accurate one or not.  
<P>

11   	Then there is the Plaintiffs' privilege in relation to
legal advice and its property in confidential information which that
advice
constitutes.  The latter is an independant right capable of protection as Hunt
CJ at CL in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions (Commonwealth) v Kane and
Others</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20140%20FLR%20468" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 140 FLR 468.</a>  I am satisfied that it is inadequately
protected by the inter partes regime currently in place.  In reaching that
conclusion I make
no finding, having heard the evidence of Mr Maconochie, that
he was responsible for making available to the journalist the content
of the
legal advice, though he did provide the journalist with a copy of the original
Summons that initiated this phase of the parties'
litigation.  Such contact as
occurred does carry the risk of a hint, at least, as to the nature of the
advice.  The Defendants must
now be aware of the serious sanctions for
contempt, as should publishers who connive at any breach, more especially as
they must
know of the opinion's confidentiality to the Plaintiffs.
<P>

12   	For the Defendants to seek to communicate the purport of
the legal advice to officers at any level of the Plaintiffs, when
that
communication is for a purpose or has an effect which risks that legal advice
coming into the public domain, is itself sufficient
reason for an injunctive
regime.  This is more particularly when the Plaintiffs have, through their
legal advisers and directly,
gone to considerable steps to attempt to keep its
circulation to the minimum number of people.  I also conclude that to use the
legal
advice as the Defendants have done for the purpose of attempting to
persuade officers of the Plaintiffs to take a different approach
to that of
their employer, which has the property in the advice and in whom resides any
legal privilege, is itself further reason
for an express injunction which
leaves no room for that to occur.  
<P>

13   	So far as confidentiality is concerned, it is for the
Defendants to demonstrate their use is proper and they have failed to
do that.
Thus in the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>LAC Minerals Ltd v International
Corona Resources Ltd</i>  <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1989/1989scr2-574/1989scr2-574.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 16 IPR 27</a> at 36 La Forest J said:
<P>

"In establishing a breach of a duty of confidence, the relevant question to be
asked is what is the confidee entitled to do with
the information, and not to
what use he is prohibited from putting it.  Any use other than a permitted use
is prohibited and amounts
to a breach of duty.  When information is provided in
confidence, the obligation is on the confidee to show that the use to which
he
put the information is not a prohibited use.  In <i>Coco v A N Clark
(Engineers) Ltd, supra</i>, at 48, Megarry J said this in regard to the burden
on the confidee to repel a suggestion of confidence:  `In particular, where
information
of commercial or industrial value is given on a business-like basis
and with some avowed common object in mind, such as a joint venture
or the
manufacture of articles by one party, for the other, I would regard the
recipient as carrying a heavy burden if he seeks to
repel a contention that he
was bound by an obligation of confidence.'  In my view, the same burden applies
where it is shown that
confidential information has been used and the user is
called upon to show that such use was permitted."
<P>

14   	Finally, it is arguable that the undertakings themselves
should have restrained that communication to the Plaintiff's officers,
but
clearly they did not.  The Plaintiffs therefore have every justification in
wishing to have injunctive reinforcement in explicit
terms. 
<P>

15   	I am satisfied that the balance of convenience favours the
continuance of the orders.  Indeed unlike the inter partes undertakings,
the
Defendants have the benefit for the first time of an undertaking as to damages,
which is to their benefit.
