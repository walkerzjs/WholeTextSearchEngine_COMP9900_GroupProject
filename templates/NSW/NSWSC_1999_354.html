70676/91	<b>NEW SOUTH WALES CRIME COMMISSION  v  EDWIN DAVIES</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  The New South Wales Crime Commission is the plaintiff and Edwin
Davies is the defendant in proceedings in this Court
which have been on foot
since 1991.  By notice of motion filed 23 December 1998 the defendant sought
leave pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(4)(a)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Assets Recovery Act</a></i> for the
making of a declaration under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(1)(a)</a> and for an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(1)(b)</a> of
the Act and he also sought the declaration and the order.  The defendant's
notice of motion prompted the filing by the plaintiff
of a further notice of
motion seeking orders that:
<P>

	<i>"1.	Pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Part 31</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 2</a> of the Rules, before any further steps are
taken in the hearing of the Notice of Motion filed by the Defendant on 23
December, 1998,
the Court decide as a separate question:</i>
<P>

<i>	Whether the Court has jurisdiction to hear the defendant's application
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990</a> (the Act).</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	The Defendant's Notice of Motion filed on 23 December 1998 be dismissed
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 5</a> as an abuse of process."</i>
<P>

2	On 22 February 1999 Barr J made the order sought in paragraph 1 of the
plaintiff's notice of motion and the question that paragraph
identified came
before me as the Duty Judge on 30 and 31 March last.
<P>

3	It is appropriate at the outset to record the following chronology:
<P>

(i)	the defendant was arrested and charged with drug offences on 1 October
1991;
<P>

(ii)	a restraining order was made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 10</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Assets Recovery
Act</a></i> on 18 December 1991 restraining all the interests in property of the
respondent, and in particular his interest in 36 Hewlett Street,
Waverley, of
which he was one of two proprietors as joint tenants;
<P>

(iii)	an assets forfeiture order was sought under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 22</a> of the statute by
summons filed on 20 December 1991;
<P>

(iv)	the restraining order and the summons seeking the assets forfeiture order
were served on the defendant on 3 January 1992;
<P>

(v)	the defendant filed a notice of motion seeking an exclusion order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
25</a> so as to exclude his interest in the property at Hewlett Street,
Waverley;
<P>

(vi)	the plaintiff made application for a proceeds assessment order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 27</a>
of the statute on 28 September 1995;
<P>

(vii)	Black AJ heard the proceedings brought by the plaintiff under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 22</a> and
the defendant's application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 25</a> in June 1998.  In those proceedings the
defendant appeared in person.  On 26 June 1998 his Honour made the assets
forfeiture order
sought by the plaintiff and on the same date he dismissed the
defendant's application for an exclusion order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 25</a>;
<P>

(viii)	the orders made by his Honour were entered on 30 June 1998.
<P>

4	As already mentioned, the defendant filed his notice of motion seeking relief
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Assets Recovery Act</a></i> on 23 December 1998, and
the essential issue for my determination now is whether that application is
competent having regard to the
time restraints imposed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26.</a>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 26</a>
provides:
<P>

	<i>"(1)   If it is proved that it is more probable than not that a specified
proportion of the value of an interest in property that
has been forfeited
under an assets forfeiture order is not attributable to the proceeds of an
illegal activity , the Supreme Court
may:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)   make a declaration to that effect, and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)   order that the person who has forfeited the interest is entitled to
be paid the proportion of the proceeds of sale of the interest
that is
specified in the declaration.</i>
<P>

<i>	(2)   Any such declaration is to be made on the basis of the extent to
which the interest in property concerned was not, when it
first became
illegally acquired property , acquired using the proceeds of an illegal
activity.</i>
<P>

<i>	(3)   The Supreme Court may make a declaration and order under this section
in relation to an interest in property on the application
of the person whose
interest it was when forfeited under an assets forfeiture order .</i>
<P>

<i>	(4)   After an assets forfeiture order has been made, an application for an
order under this section may not be made by a person:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)   </i><cite>if the person was given notice of the proceedings that led
to the assets forfeiture order -unless it is made within 6 months after
the
assets forfeiture order took effect and leave to apply has been granted by the
Supreme Court</cite><i>, or</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)   in any other case-unless it is made within 6 months after the assets
forfeiture order took effect or the Supreme Court has
granted leave to apply
after that time.</i>
<P>

<i>	(5)   Notice of an application for an order under this section is to be
given to the Commission and any other person required by
the regulations to be
given notice and a person entitled to be given notice may appear, and adduce
evidence, at the hearing of the
application.</i>
<P>

<i>	(6)   The applicant for an order under this section must give the
Commission notice of the grounds on which the order is sought.</i>
<P>

<i>	(7)   If the Commission proposes to contest an application for an order
under this section it must give the applicant notice of the
grounds on which
the application is to be contested."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>(Emphasis added)
<P>

5	In the present case, as appears from the above chronology, the defendant was
given notice of the proceedings that led to the assets
forfeiture order by the
service effected on 3 January 1992.  The notice was plainly effective because
the defendant appeared to oppose
the making of that order and to pursue his
application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 25</a> before Black AJ, as earlier mentioned.  It follows that
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(4)(a)</a> applies, and the time restraint imposed for the application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
26</a> prevented the making of such application <i>"unless it is made within six
months after the assets forfeiture order took effect and leave to apply has
been granted by the Supreme
Court."</i>
<P>

6	The assets forfeiture order took effect, the plaintiff submitted, either on
26 June 1998 or at the very latest when the order
was entered on 30 June 1998.
Mr Steirn of Senior Counsel, for the defendant, did not seek to argue
otherwise, and I accept Mr Temby's
submission that the order took effect when
entered on 30 June 1998,.
<P>

7	Mr Temby submitted that it followed as a matter of construction that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
26(4)(a)</a> not only required that the application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(1)</a> be made within
six months of 30 June 1998 but that <u>before</u> the making of that
application leave to apply be granted by this Court.
<P>

8	It is common ground that no order has yet been made granting leave to apply.
Indeed, such leave was sought in the defendant's
notice of motion filed on 23
December 1998.  It follows, if Mr Temby's submission is correct, that although
the application may be
treated as having been made within time by the filing of
the defendant's notice of motion on 23 December 1998, the time constraints
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
26(4)(a)</a> have not been met by the defendant because leave to apply was not
granted <u>before</u> 30 December 1998, that is to say within six months of the
assets forfeiture order taking effect.
<P>

9	The issue faced then is one of the construction of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(4).</a> Does the
sub-section require this Court to grant leave to apply under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26</a> prior to the
expiration of the six month period specified in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(4)(a)</a> and before the
making of the application for the order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26?</a>  Alternatively, does the
sub-section permit of the making of the order provided the application for such
order is made within six
months and provided, before the order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(1)</a> is
made, this Court has first granted leave, whether the grant is inside or
outside the six month period?
<P>

10	Mr Temby argued that the failure on the defendant's part to obtain leave
before the period of six months elapsed was fatal, and
the consequence was that
the Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the defendant's application.  Hence,
he submitted, the question
posed is to be answered in the negative.  Mr Temby
advanced submissions which I trust can fairly be summarised as follows:
<P>

(a)	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 26</a> contemplates a two stage process, the first being the leave
application and the second stage being the substantive application. 
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section
26(5)</a>, (6) and (7) are all provisions concerned with the second stage, not the
first.  The legislation recognises because of the procedural
requirements that
whilst the substantive application must be made within six months, it would not
necessarily be heard within that
period.
<P>

(b)	The construction urged by the plaintiff is consistent with the statutory
intent.  This legislation is directed at the confiscation
of the ill-gotten
gains of those involved in significant drug dealing or other serious criminal
activity.  There is a need for certainty
as to when the property finally vests
in the Crown, and there must be an end to litigation.
<P>

(c)	The Second Reading Speech on the introduction of the Bill, including <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 25</a>
and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">26</a>, contained this comment:
<P>

	<i>"A person who was not aware of proceedings resulting in the making of an
assets forfeiture order may apply to the Supreme Court within
6 months of the
making of the order, and may apply after that time with the leave of the Court,
for an exclusion order.  A person
who was aware of the proceedings may apply to
the Supreme Court for an exclusion order with its leave up to 6 months after
the making
of the assets forfeiture order.</i>
<P>

<i>	A person whose property has been forfeited under an assets forfeiture order
may also apply to the Supreme Court for an order that
the person is entitled to
be paid a proportion of the value of an interest forfeited which is shown to be
attributable to proceeds
that were lawfully obtained when the interest first
became illegally acquired property."</i>
<P>

That Second Reading Speech accords with the construction for which the
plaintiff contends.
<P>

(d)	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 26(4)</a> makes an understandable distinction between the requirements
imposed upon an applicant with notice of the proceedings that led to
the assets
forfeiture order <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 26(4)(a))</a> and any other applicant <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 26(4)(b)).</a>  If leave
is not required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(4)</a> to be granted within six months, this would ignore
the distinction which it was urged the subsection sought to make in (a) and (b)
between a person who had been given the contemplated notice and a person who
had not been.
<P>

11	Having reflected upon the competing submissions of Mr Temby and Mr Steirn, I
have concluded that the provision under consideration
should not be construed
in the manner for which the plaintiff contends.
<P>

12	There are a number of considerations that have led me to this conclusion.
<P>

13	Mr Steirn referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in <b><i>DPP v
Logan Park Investments Pty Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2037%20NSWLR%20118" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 37 NSWLR 118.</a>  That case
concerned the relationship between <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 31</a> and s 48 of the <i>Proceeds of Crime
Act</i>, 1987 (Commonwealth).  It is not necessary to consider closely the
framework of the Commonwealth statute, but, in common with the
State statute,
it provides for the confiscation of property and s 31 of the Commonwealth Act
provides machinery for relief against
the forfeiture of property.  In
<b><i>Logan Park Investments</i></b> Kirby A-CJ expressed matters of principle
relevant to the construction of the <i>Proceeds of Crime Act</i> which Mr
Steirn submitted, and which I accept, are equally relevant to the construction
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Assets Recovery Act</a></i>.  His Honour said (at pp
125-127):
<P>

	<i>"1. The Act establishes a scheme for depriving persons of property rights
which they otherwise enjoy by law. This is as much true
of a company as it is
of an individual. The right to own and to control property is an important
civic right in a society such as
ours. Indeed, it is an attribute of economic
liberty. The ownership of property is recognised in the Universal Declaration
of Human
Rights. Article 17 provides:</i>
<P>

<i>	"17.1 Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in
association with others.</i>
<P>

<i>	2. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property."</i>
<P>

<i>	Although these provisions are not, as such, part of Australian municipal
law, they reflect fundamental principles of the law of civilised
countries,
including principles upheld by the common law in Australia. To the extent that
they state applicable principles of international
law, they are available to
assist in the construction of ambiguous Federal legislation. It will be
presumed that such legislation
is written against the background of an
acceptance of such fundamental principles: see, eg, Minister for Immigration
and Ethnic Affairs
v Teoh <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2069%20ALJR%20423" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 69 ALJR 423</a> at 430 and 447; <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=128%20ALR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">128 ALR 353</a> at
384; Wentworth v New South Wales Bar Association <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20176%20CLR%20239" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 176 CLR 239</a> at 252.
Therefore, it can be accepted that the Act, in so far as it manifests ambiguity
or obscurity, would have been intended to
respect basic property rights: see
Director of Public Prosecutions for Commonwealth v Saxon (at 266). To deprive
property owners
(and I would say property owners contingently divested of their
rights) of such rights, clear legislation is required. Although in
the present
case, it is true that the respondents' property had been forfeited to, and
vested in, the Commonwealth, a proper view
of the scheme of the Act, including
s31, is that the forfeiture is not complete until all rights of the property
owner (including
any rights enjoyed under s31) are exhausted;</i>
<P>

<i>	2. Provisions for the forfeiture of property have conventionally been
construed strictly. The Act contains an elaborate scheme, the
predecessor of
which was first introduced into Australian Federal law by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/" class="autolink_findacts">Customs Act 1901</a>
(Cth). That Act contains a number of provisions for the forfeiture of goods. A
strict approach to the construction of forfeiture
provisions was endorsed by
the majority of the High Court in Murphy v Farmer  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20165%20CLR%2019" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 165 CLR 19</a> affirming
the decision in this Court: see Murphy v Farmer  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2087%20FLR%20149" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 87 FLR 149</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=72%20ALR%20691" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">72 ALR 691.</a>
In the High Court (at 27f) Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ explained:</i>
<P>

<i>	"... there were competing arguments which are based on the substantive
content of [the section]. They point in opposite directions.
On the one hand,
it is arguable that the purpose of forfeiture provisions ... is 'to ensure the
strict and complete observance of
the Customs laws'... and that that purpose
would be best served by the automatic forfeiture ... [o]n the other hand, it
seems to
us to be more strongly arguable that clear words should be required
before there is attributed to the Parliament an intention to
take the draconian
step of imposing automatic forfeiture as a penalty for "any" wrong ...
regardless of whether the wrong information
was provided as the result of an
innocent mistake or excusable ignorance. The effect of the penalty of automatic
forfeiture ... can
be devastating and quite disproportionate in that it applies
regardless of the value of the goods or the importance or effect of
the wrong
statement which was made ... [i]t is... in our view, proper to approach the
construction of the actual words of the Act
on the basis that it is to be
presumed that clear words would have been used if it were intended to impose
automatic forfeiture.
..."</i>
<P>

<i>	This approach is equally applicable to the deprivation of the property of a
company associated with the "defendant" (and let it be
assumed under its
control) but neither used in the commission of the offence nor the proceeds of
the actual offence. S31 of the Act
must be given its meaning bearing in mind
the whole range of cases to which the section will apply. It must take into
account the
variety of innocent interests which may be affected by forfeiture
of company property which is not itself "tainted" within the meaning
of s4 of
the Act;</i>
<P>

<i>	3. Whilst it is legitimate to have regard to the Explanatory Memorandum and
the purpose of the drafter, and whilst I would accept
that the legislation here
is ambiguous, permitting that course, the ultimate duty of a court is one of
fidelity to the language which
parliament has actually used: see Re Bolton; Ex
parte Beane <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20162%20CLR%20514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 162 CLR 514</a> at 518. Ministerial speeches and Explanatory
Memoranda cannot substitute for the language of parliament which is expressed
in its
statutes. The experience of the courts shows how, on many occasions,
legislation misfires. Whilst courts should strive to avoid that
result (and use
Explanatory Memorandum in aid of that laudable objective) they may not use such
memoranda to put words into an Act
of Parliament which the legislators have not
themselves added: see Dallikavak v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%209%20FCR%2098" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 9 FCR 98</a> at 102;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=61%20ALR%20471" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">61 ALR 471</a> at 475; cf Tokyo Mart Pty Ltd v Campbell

down. Each statutory quandary must be resolved by reference to the language and
apparent
purpose of the legislation under scrutiny...</i>
<P>

<i>	...Relief against forfeiture legislation is typically regarded as
beneficial and protective of the rights of individuals. It will
not be
construed narrowly: see, eg, Minister for Lands and Forests v McPherson  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2022%20NSWLR%20687" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990)
22 NSWLR 687</a> at 699."</i>
<P>

14	The correctness of the above statements of principle is not in question here
and I heed what was said in <b><i>Logan Park Investments</i></b> in approaching
my task of construction in this case.
<P>

15	Consistently with the above expressions of principle, s 26 is to be
approached as an integral part of the statutory scheme for
forfeiture of
property under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Assets Recovery Act</a></i> and the provisions
relating to such forfeiture are to be construed strictly against the plaintiff.
Allied with this is the proposition
also expressed in <b><i>Logan Park
Investments</i></b> that legislation providing for relief against forfeiture
(and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26</a> is such a provision) is not to be construed narrowly against a person
seeking such relief.  It would have been a simple matter for
the legislature to
have expressed in clear terms, if this was the legislative intention, that the
leave application was to be determined
within six months of the making of the
assets forfeiture order.  This could have been done by adding to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(4)(a)</a> the
following words, or words to the like effect:
<P>

	<i>"Within such period of six months."</i>
<P>

16	I do not find that I am much assisted by the Second Reading Speech upon
which Mr Temby relied.  As Kirby A-CJ pointed out in
<b><i>Logan Park
Investments</i></b>, such a Speech cannot substitute for the language of the
statute or, more importantly in this case, it cannot add words to it which
Parliament has not used.  Parliament has not used the words I suggested could
so easily have been used if the sub-section was intended
to call for the grant
of leave within the period of six months.
<P>

17	Whilst the statutory object of finality to which Mr Temby referred is
suggested by the imposition both in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 25</a> and in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26</a> of a six month period for
the making of an application as contemplated, neither section requires the
resolution of a substantive
application within six months of a forfeiture
order.  Indeed, sub-ss (5) and (7), contemplating as they do the need for the
giving
of notice and the possibility of a contest, render it impracticable to
achieve finality in six months.  The legislature has recognised
this also in
sub-s (4) itself, since the sub-section only requires the <u>making</u> of the
application within six months, and not its determination.  It is difficult to
see why the legislature would have necessarily
intended that leave must be
granted as a prerequisite within the period of six months provided, as the
sub-section does require,
that the application for substantive relief is itself
made within that period.  I do not see a clear legislative need to have the
leave application disposed of in six months; what is important in the
legislative scheme is that there be notice of the application
for relief and
that that be given in the time frame expressed.
<P>

18	Nor am I persuaded that the contrast between <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(4)(a)</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(4)(b)</a>
conveys the legislative intent for which Mr Temby contends.
<P>

19	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 26(4)(a)</a> addresses an application made by a person who was given
notice of the proceedings that led to the assets forfeiture order.  Such
a
person must satisfy two requirements before a declaration and/or an order can
be made in his favour under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(1).</a>  In his case an application for an order
may not be made unless:
<P>

(i)  it <u>is</u> made within six months
<P>

<u>and</u>
<P>

(ii)  leave to apply <u>has been</u> granted by the Supreme Court.
<P>

20	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 26(4)(b)</a> addresses applications made in any other case.  An
application for an order may not be made by an applicant in this latter
category
unless:
<P>

(i)  it <u>is</u> made within six months 
<P>

<u>or</u> 
<P>

(ii)  the Supreme Court <u>has</u> granted leave to apply after that time.
<P>

21	Reading <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(4)</a> strictly, there is a distinction drawn between applications
made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(4)(a)</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(4)(b)</a>, even if in the former category of
application leave is not required to be granted within six months.  The
application in the former
category must be <u>made</u> (but not determined)
within six months; otherwise leave cannot be granted at all.  In the case of an
application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(4)(b)</a>, there is no mandatory requirement that the
application of such an applicant be made within six months.  If it is so made
then unlike
an application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(4)(a)</a>, leave to apply is not required at
all.  If it is not so made then the court may grant leave after the lapse of
six months.
<P>

22	Hence there is a clear and meaningful distinction between the different
categories of applicants contemplated in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(4)(a)</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(4)(b)</a>, absent any
legislative intention that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(4)(a)</a> requires the grant of leave within the
six months period after the assets forfeiture order was made.  That distinction
takes due
account of the fact that the applicant under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(4)(b)</a> has acquired
knowledge of the forfeiture order later than the applicant to whom <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(4)(a)</a>
applies.
<P>

23	In my opinion <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(4)(a)</a> is not to be read as though containing language not
expressed, so as to require the grant of leave within six months of the assets
forfeiture order. I consider that the provision is to be read only as requiring
that there be a grant of leave before any relief
is given under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(1)</a>, the
application for which relief must be made within such period of six months.
<P>

24	If, contrary to the manner in which I have construed <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26(4)(a)</a>, the
sub-section was to be read as requiring the grant of leave within six months,
then it seems to me that on such an approach to
the sub-section, the
defendant's failure to obtain such leave within that period should be regarded
as an irregularity rather than
a nullity.  
<P>

25	Competing submissions were advanced as to whether the words <i>"may not be
made"</i> should be treated as mandatory.  However that depends on the
intention of the legislature:  did it intend the failure to obtain leave
within
the time frame to invalidate an application?  In <b><i>Project Blue Sky v
ABA</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20153%20ALR%20490" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 153 ALR 490</a> at 516 McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ
addressed the problem of the validity of an act done in breach of a statutory
provision
where their Honours said:
<P>

	<i>"The classification of a statutory provision as mandatory or directory
records a result which has been reached on other grounds. 
The classification
is the end of the inquiry, not the beginning (McRae v Coulton  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%207%20NSWLR%20644" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 7 NSWLR

being so, a court, determining the validity of an act done in breach of a
statutory provision, may easily focus on
the wrong factors if it asks itself
whether compliance with the provision is mandatory or directory and, if
directory, whether there
has been substantial compliance with the provision.  A
better test for determining the issue of validity is to ask whether it was
a
purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should
be invalid.  This has been the preferred approach
of courts in this country in
recent years, particularly in New South Wales (Hatton v Beaumont  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%202%20NSWLR%20211" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 2 NSWLR

to `the language of the relevant provision and the scope

<P>

26	The above passage was cited and applied in a more recent decision of the
Court of Appeal in <b><i>Jol v State of New South Wales</i></b> (unreported, 4
December 1998).  In this case it was held that the failure to obtain leave of
the court under s 4 of the <i>Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act</i>, 1981 was an
irregularity and did not nullify the proceedings that had been taken.  The
statute, of course, in <b><i>Jol's</i></b> case was quite different from that
with which I am here concerned, but in his judgment, with which the other
members of the court
agreed, Sheller JA, having cited the passage from
<b><i>Project Blue</i></b> that I have set out above, went on to apply the test
expressed in that passage:
<P>

	<i>"Applying that test to the present case and taking account of the language
of s 4 and the scope and object of the Act, I can see no
reason why the
legislature should have intended that a civil action instituted without the
leave of the court by a person in custody
on a conviction of felony should be
treated as a nullity rather than as an irregularity.  The purpose of the Act,
as appears from
s 5, is to enable the court to supervise such proceedings by
ensuring that they do not go forward to trial if they amount to an abuse
of
process or there is no prima facie ground for them.  That purpose is equally
well served if leave must be obtained but may be
obtained after the proceedings
have been instituted."</i>
<P>

27	Adopting the approach taken in <b><i>Jol</i></b> towards the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal
Assets Recovery Act</a></i> and taking account of the language, the scope and the
object of the Act, I do not see why the legislature should have intended, and
I
am not persuaded that it did intend, that a substantive application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26</a>
made within six months, but without the leave of the court having been obtained
within six months, should be treated as a nullity
rather than as an
irregularity.  It follows that even if, contrary to the view I have taken, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
26(4)(a)</a> is to be read as though the words <i>"within such period of six
months"</i> are to be added to it, this Court would not be deprived of
jurisdiction on the defendant's notice of motion.
<P>

28	In my opinion, therefore, this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the
defendant's applications under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Assets Recovery Act</a></i>
and it follows that the defendant's notice of motion should not be dismissed as
an abuse of process.  
<P>

29	The formal orders of the Court are as follows:
<P>

1.	The question asked in paragraph 1 of the plaintiff's notice of motion is
answered in the affirmative.
<P>

2.	The order sought in paragraph 2 of the plaintiff's notice of motion is
refused.
<P>

3.	The plaintiff is to pay the defendant's costs on this motion.
