<b><u>1929/99 NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LIMITED v PREMIER PORK PTY.
LIMITED</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:	In this matter the defendant company, Premier
Pork Pty. Limited (Premier Pork), which is under administration,
seeks an order
that the convening period for the calling of the second meeting of creditors in
the administration be extended by
one day.
<P>

2   	The basic facts are that Mr. Andrew Wily was appointed
administrator of Premier Pork on 30 June 1999.  The respondent, National
Australia Bank Limited (NAB) had filed a summons for the winding up of Premier
Pork on 8 April 1999 founded on a statutory demand
served on 13 December 1998
claiming a debt of $1,066,703.37 on an overdraft account.  That summons was
stood over to 26 July 1999
for the hearing of the notice of motion and was
further stood over yesterday until today.
<P>

3   	There were two supporting creditors, both seeking that a
winding up order be made.  In other words, those supporting creditors
did not
support the motion before the Court.
<P>

4   	The first creditors meeting was held on 6 July 1999.  At
that meeting the creditors present (it appears all by proxy) resolved
not to
appoint a committee of creditors.  Those creditors who voted against the
appointment were represented by proxy by either Mr.
Al Constantinidis or his
wife Maria Constantinidis.  The administrator on 20 July, sent a letter to
creditors convening the second
meeting of creditors on 28 July 1999.  That was
one day outside five days after the convening period.  The notice of motion,
therefore,
seeks an order extending the convening period by one day.
<P>

5   	As the application was not made within the convening period
there is no power under s439A(b) of the <u>Corporations Law</u> to extend the
time.  The application is made under s447A of the <u>Corporations Law</u>, or
perhaps, but this was not expressly stated, under s1322.  While I might have
had some doubts about the matter in considering
the matter afresh without the
benefit of authority it was held by Santow J in <b><cite>Re: Ricon
Constructions Pty Limited</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2026%20ACSR%2055" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 26 ACSR 55</a> that s447A gave power to
extend time in circumstances such as this.  In that case he gave a careful
consideration to earlier decisions.
 I intend to follow his decision.  I was
not asked to do otherwise than to note that the respondent bank argued that
there was no
such power so as to preserve its rights on appeal if necessary.
<P>

6   	While there is power under s447A to make an order on
application of a company, I do not consider such a power can be exercised
so as
to extend the convening period unless the application is made by the
administrator.  It would seem to me that on that technical
basis the motion
must fail, although were it not for my conclusion on more important grounds, it
would probably have been proper
to have made an order adding the administrator
as an applicant to the motion as this point had not been argued.  Even that
would
perhaps require some further consideration as one has less sympathy with
a last minute application to the court to exercise its discretion
in favour of
an incorrect applicant.
<P>

7   	I turn to more substantial matters.  The applicant says
that the Court should be quick to assist in the case of a procedural
mistake.
That is partly true, but the periods fixed by law for the calling of meetings
during an administration ought not to be regarded
as guidelines only.
Administrators must be expected to take proper care in the exercise of their
functions.  Proper care includes
an ability to count.  The respondent bank says
that in the exercise of my discretion I should refuse to make the orders.
<P>

8   	It says:
<P>

A.	The first meeting of creditors was called, yet some creditors were not
notified.  In answer to that the administrator said he
did his best on the
information available to him.  I accept that, but the fact is that no
information as to creditors has ever been
given by the directors.  It seems to
have come from some books in the custody of Mr. Constantinidis, who is not
shown to have any
official, or other, position with the company.
<P>

B.	All creditors, other than those apparently associated with Mr. &amp; Mrs.
Constantinidis, voted for a committee of creditors
and for an administrator
other than Mr. Wily.
<P>

C.	Any information coming from Mr. Constantinidis as to creditors should be
treated with suspicion because, in affidavit evidence,
in a matter which
appears to be somehow related, he deposed to the creditors of Premier Pork
being in an amount of $20,000, yet later
sought to represent those claiming
total debts  to be owing to them of $1,996,689.
<P>

D.	The minutes of the first meeting of creditors listing the creditors present
lists no amounts of debts, in contrast to the minutes
of a similar meeting of
the company to which I have referred, namely Rustlers Food Group Pty.
Limited.
<P>

E.	The appointment of Mr. Wily as administrator was not properly made as it was
not properly executed under the seal of the company
in the manner required by
the Articles of Association and yet purports to be executed under such seal.  I
should say  that I do not
think this should be taken into consideration as
there is a separate provision in the Corporations Law as to the setting aside
of
appointments not properly made.
<P>

F.	The report to creditors is deficient.  It contains the following statement
by the administrator:
<P>

I have been advised that the primary reason for the company's failure was the
National Australia Bank withdrawing and refusing to
review the company's
overdraft facility.
<P>

	Yet the proposal recommended by the administrator for a deed of company sets
out the proposal as follows:
<P>

I have received a proposal from the directors in accordance with s439A(c) of
the "Law".  I advise that the main provision of the
deed of company arrangement
is as follows:
<P>

1.	That litigation funding be sought in order that the company pursue its cause
of action against the National Australia Bank in
respect of the refusal by the
National Australia Bank to provide commercial bills which the National
Australia Bank had contracted
with Premier Pork Pty. Limited to provide to it;
and
<P>

2.	That the company pursue its cause of action against the National Australia
Bank;
<P>

3.	That pending the provision of litigation funding, should it prove necessary
for the litigation to be commenced, Mr. Achilles
Constantinidis agrees to fund
the proceedings on behalf of the company.
<P>

9   	The administrator supported the deed of company arrangement
proposed on the basis that it was unlikely that there would be
any realisations
by a liquidator for the benefit of unsecured creditors and that the support of
Mr. Constantinidis would not be available
in the event of a liquidation.  I
should add that there is nothing to show that the support of Mr. Constantinidis
would have been
valuable support, and there is nothing to show one way or the
other whether he would be able to give that support.  The administrator
went on
to say:
<P>

By comparison a DCA immediately protects the contingent assets of the potential
litigation, which is a very real benefit to both
creditors and shareholders of
the company.
<P>

10   	His opinion was that it was in the interests of creditors
and shareholders to accept the deed of company arrangement as a
substantial
contingent asset would be preserved, there would appear to be substantial tax
advantages for shareholders and the potential
recovery for unsecured creditors
and shareholders would be substantially increased.  He said that the unsecured
creditors were shown
in the report as to affairs to amount to $3 million.  I
should add the report as to affairs shows no such thing.
<P>

11   	I decided to reserve my decision overnight so that I could
study the evidence and the documents more closely.  I did this
because I am of
the opinion that in an application of this sort, where discretion is involved,
the court ought to be satisfied that
the extension that is sought is justified,
and therefore, in the exercise of the discretion, the court should give some
consideration
to the opinion put forward by the administrator and to form some
view whether or not it is in the interests of all those concerned
that the
extension sought be granted.
<P>

12   	After careful consideration I have come to the conclusion
that there is no sound basis for the granting of an extension. 
It is apparent
that the administrator has received no information at all from the directors.
The report as to affairs signed by one
of the directors is not a report at all,
in that there is no information given and every question which is asked is
answered with
a question mark.  There is no suggestion that there are any
contingent assets.  There is no information whatever as to the creditors.
 The
administrator said that the books of the company were made available to him by
Mr. Constantinidis.  Presumably any information
be obtained as to some possible
claim against NAB came from Mr. Constantinidis as well.  There is no suggestion
it came from the
directors.  There is no suggestion that Mr. Constantinidis has
any interest whatever in the company.
<P>

13   	In addition the following matters are of some
significance:  The creditors for whom Mr or Mrs Constantinidis held proxies
and
who voted at the first meeting are not listed as creditors in the list referred
to in the letter from Messrs. Garrett Walmsley
&amp; Madgwick, solicitors for
the administrator of 23 July 1999, which specified the creditors to whom the
report to creditors was
sent, although it is probably fair to say that Mr &amp;
Mrs Constantinidis were specified on that list.  More important, the proposal
put forward as the main provision of the deed of company arrangement, namely
that litigation funding be sought for the purpose I
have set out, and that the
company pursue its cause of action against the bank, is a recommendation for a
deed of company arrangement
for a purpose for which no foundation whatever is
shown.  In fact, the proposed action is identical with the proposal put forward
in the administration of Rustlers Food Group Pty Limited and is quite
unconnected with the reason put forward for the failure of
the company.  I
should say the opinion of the administrator in support of the deed of
arrangement is expressed in precisely the same
terms as it is in the case of
the report in the Rustlers matter.  There is no suggestion anywhere that the
NAB was obliged not to
withdraw credit and was obliged to review the overdraft
facility.  There is no basis to suggest that litigation funding might be
available; and as opposed to the report in Rustlers, there is nothing to
suggest that legal advice has been obtained as to the possible
success of any
action against the bank and, of course, as I have said, it is clear there is no
maintainable claim for that which
is proposed to be somehow put forward.
<P>

14   	In all the circumstances I have come to the clear view
that there has been no proper basis put forward to support the proposed
deed of
company arrangement; that no proper consideration could have been given to this
as no basis has been shown for the proposed
action and there is no evidence
that any director supports it.  I am of the clear view that it is in the
interest of all concerned
the company be wound up and the liquidator can then
determine whether or not there is a ground for any claim against the bank.
<P>

15   	The effect of the dismissal of the notice of motion will
be that the administration is at an end.  On that basis it is clear
and it is
accepted that an order for winding up should be made and I propose to dismiss
the notice of motion and make an order for
winding up.
<P>

(Counsel addressed)
<P>

16   	So far as the costs of the notice of motion are concerned,
while I have been critical of the administrator's report and in
the exercise of
my discretion have decided I should not grant the extension sought, I do not
think that I should make an order that
Mr. Wily pay the costs personally:
Nevertheless I add that it is a borderline decision.
<P>

17   	In those circumstances I will make no order as to costs
and order that the company be wound up, that the plaintiff's costs
of the
notice of motion be paid out of the assets of the company.
<P>

18   	The orders I will make are:
<P>

1.	That the notice of motion filed on 26 July 1999 be dismissed.
<P>

2.	That Premier Pork Pty. Limited be wound up.
<P>

3.	That Anthony Milton Sims of Sims Lockwood &amp; Partners, Level 13, Norwich
House, 6-10 O'Connell Street, Sydney be appointed
as liquidator of the
company.
<P>

4.	That the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings for winding up and its costs
of the notice of motion be paid out of the assets
of the company.
<P>

5.	That the costs of the supporting creditors be paid out of the assets of the
company.
<P>

6.	The exhibits may be returned.
