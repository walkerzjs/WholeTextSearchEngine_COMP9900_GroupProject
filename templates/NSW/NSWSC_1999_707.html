<b>1431/99  -  AICHE  v  KHOURY &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>EX TEMPORE - DUTY JUDGE</b>
<P>

1   	 This is an application brought by the plaintiff Bassam
Aiche by way of notice of motion for the following orders:
<P>

1.	That the first defendant, Joseph Khoury, be restrained from disposing of or
otherwise encumbering his shares in a shop in Bankstown
known as  V Shop -
Bankstown ("V Shop") until such time as this matter has been finally disposed
of; and
<P>

2.	that the defendant Gaby Khoury, be restrained from dispersing any proceeds
from the sale of his house at 11 Carrisbrook Avenue,
Punchbowl, up to an amount
of $150,000 but that he be free to market and sell his home in the ordinary
course at arm's length, such
moneys to be held in his solicitor's trust
account; and
<P>

3.	that the third defendant, Mr Gaby Khoury, be restrained from encumbering or
in any way dealing with his share in the house at
Punchbowl other than by a
sale at arm's length.
<P>

2   	The main proceedings that are brought by Mr Aiche were
commenced by way of summons on 18 February 1999.  Put shortly, it is
an
oppression suit under s 246AA of the Corporations Law by a series of amended
statements of claim. The second amended statement
of claim filed in court on 5
May 1999 joined Mr Gaby Khoury as the third defendant seeking an order in
relation to his conduct that
he, in fact, pay to a company, the second
defendant, Intercall Direct Pty Ltd, certain moneys said to have been diverted
from the
company by reason of both Mr Gaby Khoury and Mr Joseph Khoury's
conduct.
<P>

3   	In the main proceedings there are further claims of
breaches of duty by Mr Joseph Khoury in respect of his obligations under
the
Corporations Law.
<P>

4   	The history of this matter is important because much of it
is relied upon by each party for the purpose of, firstly, the plaintiff
pursuing his case for these orders and the defendants, in seeking to rebut the
evidence of the plaintiff for these orders.  
<P>

5   	It is clear that Mr Bassam Aiche and Mr Joseph Khoury met
in mid-1997.  At that time Mr Bassam Aiche was working for Mr Khoury
at the V
Store at Bankstown.  Mr Aiche was employed apparently as a sales person and the
company Intercall Communications, or alternatively,
the business name Intercall
Communications, was the entity through which the Bankstown store operated.
<P>

	
<P>

6   	Mr Aiche gave evidence by way of affidavit that he felt
that he was doing quite well in the business and in about June 1997
he and Mr
Joseph Khoury had a discussion wherein they agreed to go into partnership with
each other and set up a shop.
<P>

	
<P>

7   	Mr Aiche then found premises at Campsie at 281 Beamish
Street and informed Mr Joseph Khoury, who then agreed to operate a business
with Mr Aiche.  Mr Khoury is alleged to have said: "We will be equal partners
and each receive 50 per cent of the profits of the
Campsie shop."  
<P>

	
<P>

8   	Mr Aiche says that he did not have the capital required to
invest into the business, which had been discussed with Mr Khoury.
 The amount
of that capital was $20,000.  He obtained that money from his wife, Mrs Rhonda
Aiche.
<P>

	
<P>

9   	It is apparent that some facility may have been put in
place to obtain that money, and the $20,000 was invested into the business
in
about September 1997.  Mr Joseph Khoury suggested to Mr Aiche that he attend
upon his accountant, Mr George Khoury, and when Mr
Aiche did so he was informed
that Joseph Khoury would have 51 per cent of the shares and that he, Mr Aiche,
would have 49 per cent
of the shares. 
<P>

10   	Mr Aiche informed Mr George Khoury that that was not
consistent with the agreement that he and Joseph had reached because
he had
agreed with Joseph that they would share 50 per cent of the profits.  Mr George
Khoury informed Mr Aiche that he would still
obtain 50 per cent of the profits,
but it was necessary to have Mr Joseph Khoury with 51 per cent of the
shareholding rather than
have two directors or two shareholders with 50 per
cent each because it would not be appropriate if there were a deadlock.
<P>

	
<P>

11   	Mr George Khoury told Mr Aiche because Mr Joseph Khoury
had more experience it was appropriate for him to have 51 per cent
of the
shares.
<P>

	
<P>

12   	Mr Aiche, through his affidavit, informed me that he was
uncomfortable with this arrangement but he went along with it because
he
said:
<P>

"The whole purpose of me being in business with Joseph was so that he could
guide me in my new venture.  I have never been in business
before and other
than a vacation job at a car hire place had only had experience as an employee
in Joseph's store."
<P>

13   	Mr Bassam Aiche told me also that at the time, that is in
mid-1997, he was in his second year studying law at Sydney University.
<P>

	
<P>

14   	Once the moneys were invested in the business in September
1997, the business operated and received income by way of two sources,
one
being by way of commissions and the second being by way of cash purchases.  Mr
Joseph Khoury informed Mr Aiche that he would
open a bank account for the
business at the National Australia Bank and that Mr Gaby Khoury would be a
co-signatory.  It is apparent
that Mr Aiche questioned the reason for Mr Gaby
Khoury becoming a signatory, to which Mr Joseph Khoury responded that it was
necessary
because he, Joseph, may be overseas from time to time, and it was
necessary to have another signatory available.
<P>

15   	It is apparent that Gaby Khoury was in the business at
Bankstown V Shop with Joseph and had experience in the industry.
<P>

16   	What happened from September 1997 through to July 1998 is,
in some respects, quite extraordinary.  The bank statements, which
were Ex A on
previous occasions before me, demonstrated that each time a large amount of
money was paid into the account, it would
be paid out of the account within a
number of days.  The first amount of cash that Mrs Aiche paid into the bank
account was the only
amount of cash that was paid into the account during that
period.  The reason for that is because when Mrs Aiche had banked the first
amount of cash, she and Mr Gaby Khoury had a conversation to the effect that
she was not to bank any further cash at all into the
account.
<P>

17   	Mr Gaby Khoury had, she said, instructed her to give the
cash to him.  She discussed that with her husband, Mr Bassam Aiche,
and it is
clear that that is what was done.
<P>

	
<P>

18   	In about October 1997 Mr Joseph Khoury attended the
Campsie store and brought with him boxes of phones, chargers, batteries
and
other accessories, a photocopier, a fax machine and a computer.  It is apparent
that those items were certainly not paid for
directly by Mr Aiche, but they
were delivered to the store by Mr Khoury.
<P>

19   	In November 1997 Mr Aiche became concerned because he was
not receiving any moneys from the business and had noticed the diminishing
amount in the bank account.  He had a conversation with Joseph Khoury wherein
he asked him, "Where has the money gone?  What have
you used it for?  Our
arrangement is to share the profits."  Mr Khoury responded: "We have used the
money to buy stock."  Mr Aiche
then said: 
<P>

 "Look, what is going on?  I thought we would save the money and increase our
capital stock.  I have put $20,000 in.  You're using
my money to turn over
stock.  What about your contribution of $20,000 that you were meant to
make?"
<P>

Mr Khoury said: "I have already made a contribution.  I contributed all the
initial stock."  Mr Aiche said: "Whatever you bought
it was not worth $20,000,"
to which it is alleged Mr Khoury said, "I'll get Gaby to prove it to you."
<P>

20   	It is apparent that Mr Aiche was claiming that Mr Khoury
had delivered to the store stock that was secondhand. In any event,
in early
November Mr Aiche received a fax from Mr Gaby Khoury or alternatively from
Intercall Communications, the shop in Bankstown,
in which it was claimed that
the stock and equipment provided at the beginning of the business of the
Campsie store was valued at
$44,136.42.
<P>

	
<P>

21   	Mr Aiche, in his evidence in his affidavit, claimed that
that stock had been overvalued by the Khourys.  He claimed that it
was an
overvalue "of approximately $19,647.42".  One only has to do a mathematical
exercise to work out that if that be the case,
then there is a concession that
the stock that was provided was, in fact, about $24,000 worth of stock.
<P>

	
<P>

22   	Mr Aiche told me that, although he confirmed the opinion
that the figures put in the fax of $44,000-odd were a significant
overvaluation, he did not feel confident enough in himself to pursue the matter
with Joseph or Gaby.  He was hoping that things would
improve.  However, they
did not.
<P>

23   	He gave evidence of some commission payments in December
1997, which were paid into the account and immediately after were
debited from
the account.  This was an amount of approximately $24,000.  He raised this
problem again with Mr Joseph Khoury saying:
"Where has all the money in the
account gone?  Everything has gone."  Mr Joseph Khoury is said to have replied:
"I don't know.  I'll
ask Gaby and find out."
<P>

	
<P>

24   	A further conversation occurred in which Mr Joseph Khoury
said: "I have spoken to Gaby.  He said the money was used to buy
mobile phones
and stock for Campsie."  Mr Aiche responded: "Where is all the profit?  We need
money to live," to which Mr Khoury
responded: "Oh, we did not do enough
connections.  We spent more money on stock."
<P>

	
<P>

25   	Although I did not intend to go into the detail of the way
in which this industry operates, an explanation has been given
in the affidavit
material, and it is clear that the contractual arrangements that had to be
entered into with various entities require
a supplier to enter into contracts
with the customers whereby the commission is earned and paid by way of direct
credit into the
bank account of the company.
<P>

	
<P>

26   	Notwithstanding all of these concerns, Joseph Khoury
suggested that further capital injection into the business was needed.
 Mr
Aiche consented to this and arranged two loans, one of $20,000 and another of
$10,000 from the Commonwealth Bank.  He handed
this money over to Mr Joseph
Khoury and Mr Gaby Khoury to buy more stock.
<P>

	
<P>

27   	At this time, Mr Joseph Khoury told Mr Aiche that he was
not going to put any further money into the business because he had
already
contributed $44,000.  He then said to Mr Aiche: "If you want to start earning a
profit, you'll have to put more money in."
 This is the way the matter
continued until June 1998 when Mr Aiche found out that Mr Gaby Khoury and Mr
Joseph Khoury had made arrangements
with the National Australia Bank, whereby
they could operate the account over the phone rather than by cheque transaction
or, alternatively,
transfers of money by way of hard copy documents.
<P>

28   	As soon as Mr Aiche found out about this matter he acted.
He made contact with the National Australia Bank at the Bankstown
business
centre and he spoke to the manager and demanded that Mr Gaby Khoury be removed
as a signatory to the account.  It is apparent
that the National Australia Bank
then froze the account and Gaby Khoury was removed as a signatory.  Mr Aiche
then gave evidence
that "From that time onwards I have received one half of the
profits of the Campsie store."
<P>

	
<P>

29   	Although between June 1998 and the commencement of these
proceedings in February 1999 there has been an apparent problem with
the
company known as RSL COM, Mr Aiche was able to earn a profit from the business
and he informed me that the amount he received
per week was to the tune of some
thousands of dollars, approximately, he said, $5,000 to $8,000 gross per
week.
<P>

	
<P>

30   	The matter seems to have come to a head in January 1999
because of the problems that were encountered with RSL COM.  There
are some
allegations contained in the pleadings that Mr Joseph Khoury and his solicitor,
Miss O'Neill, or, alternatively, another
member of the firm of the solicitors,
attended what is described as a secret meeting with RSL COM.  RSL COM was
threatening to terminate
the contract it had with Intercall Direct Pty Ltd, the
company incorporated to operate the business of the Campsie store because
of an
allegation of fraud.  It is not clear on the evidence what this is really all
about but it is apparent that RSL COM were alleging
that some of the people who
had obtained telephones on a particular basis that they were employed were not
employed and, therefore,
not entitled to purchase at a particular price.
<P>

	
<P>

31   	RSL COM apparently made allegations that Intercall Direct
Pty Ltd were, therefore, in breach of the agreement with RSL COM
by providing
phones to people at a particular price when they were not entitled to it
because they did not qualify for that particular
contract.
<P>

	
<P>

32   	During the course of the discussions between Mr Joseph
Khoury and Mr Aiche about the problem with RSL COM, Mr Aiche obviously
instructed his solicitor, Mr J Kartsounis of J Kartsounis &amp; Co, and it is
apparent that Mr Khoury had instructed Miss O'Neill
of the firm of solicitors
Davies Owen Sistrom in Sydney.  The parties were not able to come to an
agreement as to how their differences
could be resolved and, unfortunately,
they had to resort to litigation.
<P>

	
<P>

33   	The litigation takes two forms, that is two suits in
equity, one being matter number 2567/99, the other being this matter
in which
this application is made, matter number 1431/99.
<P>

	
<P>

34   	Since the commencement of the proceedings in February
1999, there have been a number of appearances before this court and
the
application for a Mareva order first surfaced in March of 1999.  Without going
into the detail at the moment, it is clear that
that application has, since
March 1999, always been intended to be pressed by the plaintiff albeit that
without any undertaking from
March 1999 timetables for evidence have been
entered into.  Some of that will need to be detailed because of the way in
which the
plaintiff puts his case in this application.
<P>

	
<P>

35   	In March 1999, particularly on 10 March, the matter came
before the Chief Judge in Equity, Hodgson J, and on that occasion
his Honour
made the following order:
<P>

"Upon the plaintiff by his counsel giving to the court the usual undertaking as
to damages, I order that until and including 12
March 1999 the first defendant
not destroy, dispose of or alter any of the documents referred to in the letter
from the plaintiff's
solicitor to the defendants' solicitors dated 24 February
1999 as are in his possession or control."
<P>

His Honour stood the matter over to 12 March and then said:
<P>

"I expect on that occasion to be told by the first defendant what is the
position in relation to those documents and whether there
is dispute that
amounts of the order of $140,000 to $180,000 of the company's money was
disposed of under his control and whether
he raises any objection to giving an
account of how that matter was disposed of."
<P>

His Honour reserved the question of costs.
<P>

36   	What occurred between 10 March and 12 March is
controversial because the plaintiff alleges that the defendant's solicitor
has
engaged in tactics that are designed to take the heat off the defendants to use
Mr Jacobs' term.  What occurred was that on the
evening of 11 March, Miss
O'Neill, the solicitor for the defendants, drafted a cross-claim which sought
interlocutory relief against
what is known as the third cross-defendant, which
is a company Mobile Connections Australia Pty Ltd, which had been incorporated
in 1999 by Mr Aiche for the purposes of operating the Campsie business because
a deadlock had been reached in Intercall Direct Pty
Ltd.
<P>

37   	That cross-claim and the interlocutory orders that it
sought was supported by an affidavit of Miss O'Neill of 11 March 1999.
<P>

38   	Miss O'Neill referred to a number of letters in her
affidavit in support of the application, and it is submitted by the plaintiff
that she was guilty of a material non-disclosure.  That non-disclosure was a
letter that was written  by Mr Kartsounis to Miss O'Neill
on 4 March in which
Mr Kartsounis had said, amongst other things, that his client was willing to
give:
<P>

 "...an undertaking to keep full and proper books, documents and records.  In
this regard our firm is instructed to retain Halworth
Sydney to supervise the
keeping of these accounts.
<P>

We will confirm in writing when they enter upon their retainer."
<P>

39   	Miss O'Neill did not disclose that letter in her affidavit
and on 12 March when Mr Kartsounis sent Miss O'Neill a letter saying:
<P>

"We note that the affidavit omits a critical letter, being the letter to which
I have just referred" -
<P>

40   	Miss O'Neill wrote back on 15 March saying: "We can only
respond for the record that we assume by submission of this letter,
surely you
jest."
<P>

41   	In any event, on 12 March an order was made consistently
with the undertaking that had been given by the third cross-defendant
and
Horwath Services were to be retained within seven days of the undertaking of 12
March.  The undertaking to retain those accountants
was apparently  not
complied with until about 1 April when those accountants were instructed and
retained to assist the third cross-defendant.
 That delay precipitated a notice
of motion by the defendant seeking to have the plaintiff cited for contempt for
failure to instruct
those accountants within the time frame ordered by the
Chief Judge.
<P>

	
<P>

42   	It is not clear to me what happened in respect of that
motion,  but there is a further allegation that that motion was also
part of
the device used by Miss O'Neill to deflect the heat off her clients who the
plaintiff, at that stage, claims had not given
the appropriate explanation to
the Chief Judge in Equity, which he apparently wished to have as stated on 10
March and which he did
not have on 12 March other than by way of an affidavit
filed by Mr Khoury dated 11 March 1999.
<P>

	
<P>

43   	It can be seen from that history that these proceedings,
although only on foot since February, have had a number of what might
be
described as unsatisfactory skirmishes or, alternatively quite legitimate
skirmishes.  When the matter came before me the plaintiff
relied upon the
evidence of Mr and Mrs Aiche, the evidence of the solicitor, Mr Jim Kartsounis,
and the evidence of Mr Claude E Jugmans,
who was the accountant instructed by
the plaintiff, who was an expert to assist in respect of the main matter before
the court.
<P>

44   	Mr Cashion of Senior Counsel relied upon the affidavit of
Miss O'Neill and sought to tender the affidavits of Alexander William
Bathgate
and the affidavits of Messrs Gaby and Joseph Khoury.  He specifically did not
read those affidavits and in tendering them,
 he submitted that they were
tendered to prove that an explanation had been given.
<P>

	
<P>

45   	Mr Jacobs QC objected to this course on the basis that
this matter that I was hearing was to do with whether or not there
had been a
proper explanation.  I ultimately rejected the contents of the documents in the
circumstances of the agitation of this
matter but allowed the portions of the
affidavits in, that is the first paragraphs of each of them and the attestation
clauses to
demonstrate that explanations, whatever they may be, had been
tendered to the court and also that there had been some compliance
with the
apparent requirement to give an affidavit.
<P>

	
<P>

46   	Mr Jacobs QC cross-examined Miss O'Neill for a lengthy
period about the correspondence between herself and Mr Kartsounis basically
for
the purpose of demonstrating the point that he makes, that is that the
defendants have with the assistance of the defendants'
solicitor created what
he described as a smoke screen that the defendants had been able to hide behind
and that I should have some
reservations about their willingness to meet a
judgment should the plaintiff be successful.
<P>

	
<P>

47   	It is clear that the relationship between Mr Kartsounis
and Miss O'Neill has been a difficult one.  It is also clear that
the heat of
the battle, as it might be termed, has been difficult.  However, it seems to me
that the matters to which Mr Jacobs referred,
that is the failure to inform the
court of the offering of an undertaking, was a very unsatisfactory oversight at
the very least
by Miss O'Neill.
<P>

	
<P>

48   	When confronted with this in the witness box, Miss O'Neill
would only go so far as to say that she was extremely busy that
night, which is
not doubted, and that it was possible "that the letter should have been
disclosed".  There is no doubt that the letter
should have been disclosed and,
on mature and sensible reflection, I am sure, as Mr Cashion would concede and
has very sensibly conceded,
the letter should have been disclosed; Miss O'Neill
will come to the conclusion that the letter should have been disclosed.
<P>

	
<P>

49   	That conduct must be looked at in the application that is
being sought here today.  It is not Miss O'Neill's assets that are
being sought
to be frozen.  It is the defendants'.
<P>

	
<P>

50   	Mr Jacobs QC relies upon the authority of <b>Patterson v
BT Engineering</b> (1989) 18 NSWLR at 319.  He says that effectively the court,
in taking into account the nature of the prima facie case wherein a
prima facie
case has been established of a misappropriation of funds, will be more
comfortable in finding that there is a risk that
the defendants may dissipate
the assets prior to judgment and that the plaintiff would be frustrated from
securing a payment of any
judgment moneys.
<P>

	
<P>

51   	It is true that the Court of Appeal said that the nature
of the case can be taken into account.  At 325 of that report, Gleeson
CJ said
when looking to the test to be applied:
<P>

"I consider that Giles J was correct in taking the view that the evidence as to
the nature of the claim in which the appellant was
allegedly involved, which
established a prima facie case against him, was such as to justify the
conclusion that there was a danger
that the appellant would dispose of assets
in order to defeat any judgment that might be obtained against him and that
such danger
was sufficiently substantial to warrant the injunction.
<P>

There is no reason in principle why the evidence which is relevant to the first
of the issues earlier referred to might not also
have a bearing on the second,
and this will especially be so where the prima facie case that is made out
against the defendant is
one of serious dishonesty involving diversion of money
from its proper channels."
<P>

	His Honour then went on to say:
<P>

"This is a case in which the plaintiff claims that the defendant making use of
a corporation controlled by him, fraudulently misappropriated
a large sum of
money which, if it is still under the control of the appellant, would be quite
likely to constitute directly or indirectly
the bulk of his assets."
<P>

52   	There is no doubt that a prima facie case on the evidence
before me has been established; that $116,000, at least, has been
diverted from
the business and/or not accounted for by the defendants to the plaintiff.  In
saying that, it is also clear from the
evidence filed by the plaintiffs that
there is a live issue between the plaintiff and the defendants as to what
moneys the business
received or were received by the defendants for the purpose
of purchasing stock and maintaining the business at Campsie.
<P>

53   	Mr Jacobs QC submits, having reached that conclusion, that
I should then be satisfied that there is the risk, to which the
authorities
refer, and I should grant the orders.  He says that the prima facie evidence
establishes that "These people are crooks"
and that I would not be comfortable
leaving the position as it is without securing the position for the plaintiff
because, he says,
the defendants will not be prejudiced.
<P>

	
<P>

54   	In weighing up that second limb, which is required to be
weighed up, I do take into account that there has been established
a prima
facie case of dishonesty with the qualification that there is a live issue
between the expert accountants.  
<P>

	
<P>

55   	Another issue which Mr Jacobs QC says I should take into
account is the fact that the defendants had control of the business
records of
the company and the majority of the cheque butts for the period September 1997
to June 1998 have not been produced.  This
failure to produce the cheque butts
was the subject of a great deal of evidence.  It seems to me that the cheque
butts are an important
part of this case.
<P>

	
<P>

56   	Mr Cashion SC suggests that I should not be taken along
with the plaintiff in its submission because he submits, to use his
words, "It
is a beat-up".  But Mr Jacobs does make a good point when he says, in answer to
Mr Cashion's suggestion, that he could
obtain the photocopies of the cheques
from the bank;  that is all very well, but he wants to see what is written on
the cheque butt.
 In other words, there may well be admissions on those cheque
butts as to what was done with the cash that his client claims was
diverted
from the business.
<P>

	
<P>

57   	There is no doubt that there are numerous cheques that
were made out to cash, and there is no doubt that the cheques were
also made
payable to the American Express.  As to this last matter, American Express
vouchers have been obtained in some form.  It
has been possible for the
plaintiff to analyse where it is that some of the moneys of the business
went.
<P>

	
<P>

58   	It is alleged that in looking to the American Express
statements, a wide range of purchases include such things as Punchbowl
Cellars,
women's clothing, The General Shore Company and The Bodyline Fitness Centre.
The plaintiff says that that would also weigh
in the plaintiff's favour in this
application and give me concern that these people will not be trusted because
they have dissipated
the assets of the business by, in effect, personal
spending, frivolous spending for their own use.
<P>

	
<P>

59   	It is probably not a very clever scheme to pay for the
personal items such as the ones that I have just mentioned by using
one's Amex
card where it is obvious that the detail can be tracked down.
<P>

	
<P>

60   	On 10 March 1999, a statement was made to the Chief Judge
in Equity that has concerned the plaintiff.   It is apparent that
the Chief
Judge asked the counsel for Mr Joseph Khoury: "Does your client have control of
the cheque butts?" to which counsel answered:
"The cheque butts are in the
control of someone else."  The cheque butts have never been produced.
<P>

61   	The conversations that occurred between Mr Kartsounis and
Miss O'Neill were also the subject of evidence and, in particular,
what Miss
O'Neill initially said in respect of the cheque butts was: "They are with my
client."  Mr Kartsounis says that he asked
for the cheque butts by close of
business that day, to which Miss O'Neill is said to have responded: "I do not
have any instructions",
to which Mr Kartsounis said: "Unless you can undertake
that I will have them in my office by 5pm today, I will be moving the duty
judge for orders as soon as possible", to which it is alleged Miss O'Neill
said: "I cannot give you that undertaking.  I need to
get instructions."
<P>

	
<P>

62   	A further conversation is said to have taken place.  This
is prior to the appearance before the Chief Judge, wherein Mr Kartsounis
once
again asked for an undertaking to which Miss O'Neill said: "No, I cannot give
you that undertaking.  I am not sure where they
are", to which Mr Kartsounis
responded: "I believe you said they were with your clients", to which Miss
O'Neill is said to have said:
"I said I imagined they were with my clients, and
I would have to take instructions."
<P>

	
<P>

63   	Once again, the failure to produce the cheque butts and
the conduct of the defendants' solicitor is relied upon to suggest
that there
is some skulduggery going on whereby the defendants do not want to produce the
cheque butts because the inference being
those cheque butts contain information
which will be adverse to the defendants' claim and the fact that they will not
produce them
is evidence of their unreliability and, it is alleged, their
dishonesty, which I would rely upon in reaching the conclusion that
these
people cannot be trusted and should be the subject of the restraining orders
sought.
<P>

	
<P>

64   	There is one other matter that I should refer to and that
is the purported sale or the intention to sell Mr Gaby Khoury's
house.  It is
apparent from the evidence that Mr Joseph Khoury disclosed to Mr Aiche that Mr
Gaby Khoury was renovating his house.
 He told Mr Aiche that Gaby had been
doing some renovations on the property and that he was probably going to get a
good price for
the property when he sold it.
<P>

	
<P>

65   	It is also clear from Mr Aiche's evidence that Mr Joseph
Khoury said to him:
<P>

 "Gaby said he is renovating his house.  He wants to lease it out, negative
gear it, then sell it for a profit."
<P>

In December 1998, Joseph Khoury took Mr Aiche to see the house from the outside
and said:
<P>

"He has finished renovating it.  He has renovated the kitchen - $10,000 worth
of tiles in the bathroom, landscaping, palm trees,
lighting and everything.  He
should get good money for it."
<P>

66   	After the proceedings were commenced on 29 April
approximately this year, Mr Aiche telephoned the agent that had been identified
on the For Sale sign outside the premises.  That For Sale sign was not outside
the premises in April this year.  When Mr Aiche telephoned
the agent, he was
told that the property was still on the market but:  
<P>

"The owner told us to take down the signs.  That is why there is no sign at the
property.  The owners have bought another waterfront
property and they will be
moving to the new property."
<P>

67   	There is then further detail of the amounts of money that
the real estate agent alleges that he was told had been spent on
the property
to renovate it.
<P>

	
<P>

68   	The plaintiff relies upon this action of taking down the
sign but leaving the property on the market and this conversation
to submit
that I would be convinced that this precipitated a need for restraint.
<P>

	
<P>

69   	There is one other matter that has not been referred to
but which I have taken into account, and that is a conversation that
occurred
between Mr Aiche and Mr Khoury late in 1998.  It is not clear when it occurred
but it occurred some time between June and
the beginning of January 1999.
<P>

	
<P>

70   	Mr Aiche was asking Mr Joseph Khoury for the financial
records including the cheque butts for the period between September
1997 and
June 1998.  Mr Aiche, who was not challenged, said Joseph Khoury said:
<P>

"The company has not lodged tax returns and if the tax office asks me about the
records, I will say they have been destroyed."
<P>

That piece of evidence suggests that Mr Khoury would be willing to tell the tax
office that records had been destroyed.  Of course,
it is not clear that that
is the truth and it is prima facie clear that that is not the truth.
<P>

	
<P>

71   	The defendants, on the other hand, claim that there are a
number of features of this case that will convince me that the restraining
orders sought by the plaintiff are inappropriate.  One matter is, although not
expressly relied upon, taken into account by me that
since 30 June 1998 there
has been a share of the profits, continuation of the business and no suggestion
that money has been diverted.
<P>

	
<P>

72   	Another matter in the defendants' favour is Mr Joseph
Khoury does not seem to have hidden the fact that his brother was selling
his
house and renovating it prior to selling it.  A third matter is the
commencement of the cross-claim and the consent orders. 
The plaintiff claims
it is a smoke screen, I am not satisfied that it is an abuse.
<P>

73   	There is the further matter of non-production of documents
by the plaintiff to the defendants for the purpose of enabling
the defendants'
accountants to assist the defendants in meeting the claims of
misappropriation.
<P>

	
<P>

74   	There is the further matter that Bryson J has expedited
the matter for hearing and that the parties have entered into a timetable
for
the filing of evidence, such evidence of filing to be completed by early
September and the anticipation the matter be heard,
according to Mr Jacobs,
some time this year.
<P>

	
<P>

75   	Mr Cashion relies upon delay of the plaintiff in bringing
this claim for a restraining order or a Mareva order.  In the most
helpful
written submissions that have been provided to me by Mr Jacobs QC, para 15
says:
<P>

"The first intimation that such a misappropriation occurred was on about 10
March 1999 when Bassam received copies of some of the
company's paid cheques
from NAB."
<P>

76   	It was submitted by the plaintiff that March 1999 was the
appropriate time to commence these proceedings for a restraining
order.
<P>

	
<P>

77   	Mr Cashion SC relies upon the recent decision in the High
Court of <b>Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2073%20ALJR%20657" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 73 ALJR 657</a>, in
particular at 669 where, in the judgment of Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and
Callinan JJ, their Honours said:
<P>

"We agree with the tenor of what was said with particular respect to Mareva
relief before judgment by the Court of Appeal of New
South Wales of Mason P,
Sheller JA and Sheppard AJA in <b>Frigo v Culhaci</b>:
<P>

'A Mareva order is a drastic remedy which should not be granted lightly.  A
Mareva order is an interlocutory order which, if granted,
imposes a severe
restriction upon a defendant's right to deal with his or her assets.  It is
granted at the
<P>

suit of a plaintiff whose status as a creditor is in dispute and should need
not be a secured creditor.  Its purpose is to preserve
the status quo not to
change it in favour of the plaintiff.
<P>

The function of the order is not to provide a plaintiff with security in
advance for a judgment that he hopes to obtain and that
he fears might not be
satisfied;  nor is it to improve the position of the plaintiff in the event of
the defendant's insolvency...
<P>

Many authorities attest to the care with which  courts are required to
scrutinise applications for Mareva orders.'"
<P>

78   	Their Honours then referred to <b>Patterson's</b> case and
the question to be considered on an exercise of a discretion as follows:
<P>

"Discretionary considerations generally also should carefully be weighed before
an order is made.  Has the applicant proceeded diligently
and expeditiously
...?"
<P>

79   	Mr Cashion SC says, in answer to that question, in respect
to the plaintiff, a resounding no.  The plaintiff says, but yes,
because it was
not until 10 March that there was the first intimation that the
misappropriation had occurred.
<P>

80   	Consistent with my duty, I have had to scrutinise the
evidence to see if that can be accepted.  I am afraid that it cannot.
 The
evidence which causes me to reject that submission comes from the
correspondence of the parties, which has been annexed to the
affidavits of Miss
O'Neill and also to that of Mr Kartsounis.  On 29 January 1999, the plaintiff
was in a position to make an allegation
by way of correspondence in which it
was said, and I quote: 
<P>

"It is obvious in all the above circumstances that there is now a deadlock in
the company with our client wishing to run it.  Your
client on the other hand
does not wish for the company to continue trading, does not wish to pursue RSL
COM, is apparently unhelpful
in relation to the statutory requirements and is
apparently unhelpful in accounting for the monies received and otherwise
appropriated
by him on account of the business.
<P>

This is not intended to be a full record of our client's complaints and your
client's defalcations.
<P>

In all the circumstances, we are instructed to propose the following:"
<P>

and there follows then some claims which include:
<P>

"Your client account to our client fully with support by voucher for the monies
he has received and or dealt with as set out above.
 Our preliminary estimate
is that your client had diverted $107,059 to his personal use."
<P>

By way of response on the very same day, the defendant said:
<P>

"Your allegation that our client has diverted the sum of $107,059 est. to his
own personal use is denied."
<P>

There is then a request for further material.
<P>

	
<P>

81   	True it is that it is an estimation but true it is also
that 10 March was not the first intimation that the misappropriation
had
occurred.  Indeed, it was obvious or alternatively should have been obvious to
Mr Aiche that if he was not being told where the
money was going, and he had
the concerns that he did, that the money was being diverted, and he was able to
conclude by January that
it was at least or estimated to be $107,000, that he
should have moved and moved promptly.
<P>

82   	The other matter that is important to note is that when he
wanted to move in respect of the bank to stop the conduct of the
money
disappearing, he did.  He went to the National Australia Bank, achieved the
outcome of having the bank freeze the account and
from then on he says no
further moneys have been diverted.
<P>

83   	It seems to me that to come to the court in March 1999,
putting to one side what has happened between then and now, to ask
the court to
intervene in respect of these matters said to have occurred during the period
September 1997 to June 1998 when he had
every reason, on his version of events,
to come so much earlier, is a very important part and very important course of
conduct to
be taken into account in exercising my discretion.
<P>

	
<P>

84   	I am conscious that Mr Jacobs has informed me from the Bar
table, and I accept from the evidence that Mr Aiche was not a person
with a
great deal of business experience, but he had worked with the Khourys for a
period of time and he had completed two years
of a law degree at Sydney
University;  he had opened his own  business with Mr Khoury and he was able to
achieve something that perhaps
others may not have in securing the freezing of
an account by a bank without the intervention of a third party.
<P>

	
<P>

85   	All of that is weighed against the submission that really
this is a young man who has been led along by the dishonest conduct
of the
defendants and well he might have been, but this is the exercise of a
discretion in the face of a very long delay when very
stringent orders are
being sought.
<P>

	
<P>

86   	When I weigh all that up against the statement made by Mr
Khoury, which it seems to me is prima facie a concern that he would
tell the
tax office that documents have been destroyed, I have an uneasy feeling but, in
the circumstances, it is a borderline case
and I am afraid the plaintiff has
not convinced me to the requisite level of satisfaction that is required in
these cases that I
should make these orders.
<P>

	
<P>

87   	The fact that there has been no problem since 30 June 1998
when Mr Aiche acted promptly with the bank, the fact that Mr Khoury
has been
apparently open in talking about the sale of his brother's house, the
additional facet to the conversation with the real
estate agent that Mr Gaby
Khoury was going to move into a waterfront home, and the obvious contest and
involvement of the defendants
in this litigation lead me to the conclusion that
I should not exercise my discretion in granting the orders sought in favour of
the plaintiff in this notice of motion.
<P>

	
<P>

88   	Accordingly, I refuse to make the orders sought in paras
2, 3 and 4 of the notice of motion.
<P>

DISCUSSION ENSUED RE COSTS
<P>

	
<P>

89   	An application has been made by the defendants for costs,
the successful party to the notice of motion in resisting the Mareva
orders
sought by the plaintiff.  Mr Jacobs QC submits that because this case involved
the finding that there was a prima facie case
of misappropriation, it would be
an appropriate case in which to order that costs be costs in the cause.  
<P>

	
<P>

90   	Mr Cashion SC submits that the defendants have been
successful and in the ordinary course an order should follow that event
in
their favour.  Although Mr Jacobs of counsel sought an adjournment if I was
against him on this matter to allow his leader, Mr
Jacobs QC, to address me on
costs, I have not acceded to that application.
<P>

	
<P>

91   	I have, in fact, asked Mr Cashion SC to address a further
factor which seems to me appropriate to take into account and that
is that the
conduct of the defendants, through their solicitor, has been less than ideal,
and indeed the question I posed to Mr Cashion
SC is that the conduct of the
defendants' solicitor had been less than ideal.  Mr Cashion SC responded that
it really is that both
parties could be characterised with that epithet because
he says the conduct of Mr Kartsounis may well have been less than ideal.
<P>

	
<P>

92   	It seems to me that my finding that this was a borderline
case favours the plaintiff's submission.  True it is that the defendants
were
successful today, but I have been persuaded to exercise my discretion in the
plaintiff's favour having regard to the fact  there
has been a finding that
there is a prima facie case of misappropriation established and my finding that
on balance it was a borderline
case.
<P>

	
<P>

93   	In all the circumstances of this case, I make an order
that the costs of this application, including the costs of the motion
that was
filed in April, be costs in the cause.
<P>
