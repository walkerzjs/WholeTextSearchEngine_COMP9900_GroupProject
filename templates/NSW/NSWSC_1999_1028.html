<P>

 
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

 
<P>

1  	MASTER:   This is an application under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>
in respect of the estate of the late Peter Holeva who died on 24 March 1997.
The deceased was survived by his defacto spouse the
defendant, his two
daughters of that relationship Peta and Franchesca and his daughter Nicole, the
plaintiff in the proceedings.
 Nicole is the daughter of the deceased and
Tracey Klein with whom the deceased lived between 1976 and mid 1980.
<P>

2  	     Under his will made 1 November 1993 the deceased gave the
whole of his estate to the defendant and appointed her executrix.
<P>

3  	     The estate consists of unit 17/164 Bondi Road, Bondi. There
is evidence of the value and after allowing for selling expenses
one would
expect the amount to be in the order of $145,000.
<P>

4  	     There is money in an account and after payment of costs of
commission the amount remaining is $8,799, a total of $153,799.
<P>

5  	     Unfortunately in this matter costs have been incurred. The
defendant's costs amount to $20,000 and those of the plaintiff
$22,344. There
are also airfares for the plaintiff and her mother who gave evidence of some
$3,020. Accordingly the net distributable
estate if orders were made in the
usual terms would be $128,425.
<P>

6  	     The other assets involved are the house at 112 Beach Road,
Bondi that was owned by the deceased and the defendant as joint
tenants which
has passed by survivorship to the defendant.  It has a value in the range of
$550,000 to $600,000. There are also three
trust accounts, two of which were in
the deceased's name.  One was an investment with St George in the name of the
deceased in trust
for his daughter Franchesca in the sum of $130,000. The other
was a deposit in the Commonwealth Bank in a term deposit in the name
of the
deceased in trust for Peta in the sum of $50,000. Although it was not referred
to in the defendant's affidavit specifically,
it transpired in
cross-examination that there was also another deposit in the St George Bank in
the name of the defendant.  That
was in trust for both Peta and Franchesca in
the amount of $58,000 but which has now reduced down to $38,000.
<P>

7  	     I refer to some of the history in the matter in order to put
the matter into context. It was in 1968 that the deceased
and his brother Paul
Holeva arrived in Australia from Czechoslovakia. In 1976 Tracey Klein and the
deceased  commenced living together
first in a flat at Rose Bay and later in
Bondi.  The plaintiff was born on 13 November 1978. In about the middle of 1980
the deceased
and the plaintiff's mother separated, the plaintiff then being
about twenty-one months old.
<P>

8  	     In January the next year, 1981, the deceased and the
defendant commenced to live together. They had a child Peta born on
14 June
1982. Not long after her birth the defendant and the deceased separated and
remained separated for some four years. At the
end of 1982 in November the
plaintiff and her mother left Australia for the USA and took up permanent
residence in the United States.
The circumstances in which they left caused the
deceased some hurt but that is not a matter which is the fault of the
plaintiff.
The plaintiff at that stage was aged four years.  In due course the
plaintiff's mother married Mr Weaver in 1982 although that marriage
only lasted
several years.
<P>

9  	     It was in 1986 that the deceased and the defendant resumed
their cohabitation and in November of that year they purchased
the property at
Beach Road Bondi having sold the house they had at Paddington. On 18 February
1987 the deceased and defendant's second
daughter Franchesca was born. She is
now aged twelve. On 1 November 1993 the deceased executed and published his
last will and he
died on 24 March 1997.
<P>

10  	     By May of 1997 the plaintiff had completed her education at
Douglas High School and in August of that year her mother
married Mr Klein.  In
August the plaintiff commenced her Bachelor's Degree at Birmingham Southern
College, Birmingham Alabama. She
studies English and Art.  In due course
probate was granted and these proceedings were commenced.
<P>

11  	     In applications under the<b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></b> the
High Court has recently in<b> Singer v Berghouse</b> (1994) 181 CLR set out a
two stage approach that a Court must take.  At page 209 it said the
following:
<P>

"The first question is, was the provision (if any) made for the applicant
'inadequate for (his or her) proper maintenance, education
and advancement in
life'?  The difference between 'adequate' and 'proper' and the
interrelationship which exists between 'adequate
provision' and 'proper
maintenance' etc were explained in<b> Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited.</b>
The determination of the first stage in the two-stage process calls for an
assessment of whether the provision (if any) made was
inadequate or what, in
all the circumstances, was the proper level of maintenance etc appropriate for
the having regard, amongst
other things, to the applicant's financial position,
the size and nature of the  deceased's estate, the totality of the relationship
between the applicant and the deceased, and the relationship between the
deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims upon
his or her
bounty.
<P>

The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves similar
considerations.  Indeed, in the first stage of the process,
the court may need
to arrive at an assessment of what is the proper level of maintenance and what
is adequate provision, in which
event, if it becomes necessary to embark upon
the second stage of the process, that assessment will largely determine the
order which
should be  made in favour of the applicant.  In saying that, we are
mindful that there may be some circumstances in which a court
could refuse to
make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to have been left
without adequate provision for proper
maintenance.  Take, for example, a case
like<b> Ellis v Leeder</b> where there were no assets from which an order could
reasonably be made and making an order could disturb the testator's
arrangements
to pay creditors."
<P>

12  	     Having regard to what is said by the High Court it is
necessary to look at the plaintiff's situation.  The plaintiff herself
has no
assets of any substance. She is presently twenty-two years of age and she is
two years into a four year degree course. Apart
from completing this degree
course she wishes to do a Master's degree for two years at Graduate school.
The purpose of this is to
enable her to attain a teaching qualification and it
would seem to be a necessary progression from the basic degree which she is
presently studying. She has had a number of expenses at the moment in respect
of her education. They are, firstly, her tuition fees
of US$13,750 and an
activity fee of US$210.  She shares a flat with a friend and the expenses and
utilities are in the order of US$5,640.
 She has expenses for food at $40 per
week, a total of US$2,080. This is a total living and education expense of
US$21,680.
<P>

13  	     However, she has been able to obtain grants and
scholarships and her grant amounts to US$5,850 per year. Her income from
her
part-time work is some $4,200. There is thus a shortfall of US$11,630 for her
various expenditures. She has, in the past, borrowed
for fees and has loans of
approximately $13,020 which will have to be paid when she completes her course.
If she continues to borrow
during the course of her education she would be
likely to have a sum in the order of A$45,000 to pay at the end of her
course.
<P>

14  	     Clearly the plaintiff works hard to support herself at
college and she still needs the assistance of her mother and stepfather
to make
ends meet. Her mother and stepfather live in Horton Alabama in the USA. Their
circumstances are modest. They both work in
a drug store which the stepfather
operates and between them they draw a total wage of about US$30,000 per
annum.
<P>

15  	     Their assets are as follows; the plaintiff's mother has the
house which she bought in the United States in Alabama which
is worth about
US$42,000. She has had a loan on that which will be paid out in September next
year and that loan at the moment is
about $6,000. She has an old car and some
personal effects.
<P>

16  	     Her husband owns the home which they occupy in Horton
Alabama worth about US$40,000 which has a loan of some US$4800.
 The drug shop
is valued at approximately US$108,000 and there are two motor vehicles which
the stepfather has.
<P>

17  	     The contact between the plaintiff and the deceased is, of
course, an important matter.  The plaintiff moved to the United
States from
Australia when she was four in circumstances as I have indicated before. There
was, however, communication between the
deceased and the plaintiff. He used to
write to her on birthdays and at Christmas, apart from a few odd occasions when
she had moved.
At times she was sent a  small gift such as earrings and
occasionally amounts of $100 on these occasions.
<P>

18  	     Clearly the plaintiff responded to this communication from
her father.  She would send him photos and on at least one
occasion when she
was growing up, she thinks when she was seven, she spoke to him on the phone.
The fact that she wished to see her
father is evident in plans she made in 1996
when she planned to come to Australia. Apparently her father indicated that he
would
try and help her financially to come out but her mother agreed to pay her
return airfare and the plan was to come at Christmas 1997.
Although she wrote
in 1997, the plaintiff did not hear from her father for six months. In October
she found out from a friend that
her father had died in March 1997. The
circumstances of that must have been a shock to the plaintiff but in due course
they did come
for a holiday.
<P>

19  	     The contact clearly is one which was reciprocated by the
plaintiff during the period prior to the death of the deceased.
Whether the
plaintiff has been left without adequate and proper means for education and
maintenance in life is quite clear because
she is at a crucial stage in her
education.  She has had a real need for assistance.  She is doing everything
she can to get herself
through college. Her need over the next four years,
putting aside the assistance she gets from her parents approximates $70,000.
Even with this she will still have her present debts of US$13,020 which will
have to be paid off.
<P>

20  	     It is, of course, necessary to consider the position of
others who have a claim on the bounty of the deceased. These are
Franchesca,
Peta and the defendant.
<P>

21  	     Peta is seventeen and will finish school in the year 2000.
She then wishes to go to the University of New South Wales.
<P>

22  	     Franchesca is aged twelve and is in year seven at the local
Holy Cross school.  She wishes to go to Kambala possibly as
a boarder although
that is not necessary. She lives with her mother near the school. Apart from
the trust fund of $215,000, they
have no assets.
<P>

23  	     The defendant's situation certainly is not secure. By way
of assets she has the house at Bondi valued at $550,000 to $600,000.
The house
is adequate for her needs and the needs of her daughters and there is no
suggestion that there should be any change in
this housing arrangement. She
also has the flat which is presently providing an income of $15,000.  If it
were sold it would realise
$145,000. She has something in excess of $10,000 in
shares. Her income situation is not good. Her wage amounts to $19,760. The
interest
on the other two trust accounts as $8,794 and the rental is $7,800
which is a total of $36,354. She also gets interest from the $35,000
investment
which would probably amount to $1,750 per annum. After tax this leaves her with
income of $460 per week. Her expenses,
including the childrens' expenses, are
$30,854.85 per annum. She is clearly not making ends meet. This is borne out by
the fact that
she has used $20,000 of funds over the last two and a half years
and has done so by using the capital in the account in her name.
Her real needs
in the future relate to meeting her daughters' education.
<P>

24  	      So far as Peta is concerned there is $50,000 in a trust
fund and this is clearly sufficient to unable her to complete
her University
education comfortably.
<P>

25  	     Franchesca wants to go to Kambala. The deceased and the
defendant talked of this prior to the deceased's death and clearly
it is a
reasonable desire on their part.  The fees for Kambala presently at the moment
range up to $10,000 per annum by the year
12 and if she boarded there would be
another $10,000 per annum.  Obviously at Franchesca's present age the fees are
somewhat less.
The suggestion of boarding apparently came from Franchesca but
there is no reason why it is necessary.  In fact no serious reasons
as to why
she should board have been put forward.  Clearly the $130,000 will be
sufficient to enable Franchesca to complete schooling
and also attend
University if she wishes.
<P>

26  	     The defendant works part-time.  It is approximately
twenty-four hours a week that she averages and she works as a sales
assistant.
Her income potential in this regard is limited because she has no other
experience or background training. She is fifty
years of age and her present
employer is going through difficulties in the business and is likely to close.
However, it is obvious
to me that the defendant is certainly a capable woman
and I think, notwithstanding her age, she would be able to get employment as
the business closes down. As her children get older she will be able to work
more.  She would also like to buy a carport for some
$24,000 for a car which
was recently damaged in a hail storm.
<P>

27  	     The case is really quite a difficult one. Widow's claims
are frequently the subject of applications in this Court. Although
the
defendant does not have to justify the provisions in the will, consideration of
a widow's claim is useful in order to set in
context the proper
considerations.
<P>

28  	     The Court of Appeal in<b> Goloski V Goloski</b> (unreported
5 October 1993) has referred to formulations of this standard to be expected in
respect of a widow in terms which refer
to a decision of Powell in<b> Luciano v
Rosenblum</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20NSWLR%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2 NSWLR 65</a> and<b> Elliot v Elliot,</b> which was approved
by the Court of Appeal on 24 April 1986.  There his Honour said:
<P>

"Where the marriage of a deceased and his widow has been long and harmonious,
where the widow has loyally supported her husband
and assisted him to build up
and maintain his estate, the duty which a deceased owes to his widow can be no
less than to the extent
to which his assets permit him to achieve that result;
first to ensure that his widow be secure in her home for the rest of her life
and that if either the need arises or the whim strikes her she have the
capacity to change her home; secondly that she have available
to her an income
sufficient to enable her to live in a reasonable degree of comfort and free
from any financial worry; and, third,
that she have available to her a fund to
which she might have resort in order to provide herself with such modest
luxuries as she
might choose and which would provide her with a hedge against
any unforeseen contingency or disaster that life might bring".
<P>

     
<P>

29  		In the present case the length of the relationship between the
deceased and the plaintiff has gone for some twelve years.
 There was a break
in it for a period of four  years while the parties separated.  Apart from
this, there is nothing in the evidence
to suggest that the relationship was not
happy. Although it is of a reasonable duration, it is not probably the type of
length of
relationship which was being referred to by his Honour in the quote
to which I have just referred.
<P>

30  	     An important point, however, in the defendant's favour is
that she has contributed substantially to the house. Originally
the defendant
had a property in Paddington which was in her name. She had purchased it for
$31,000 and in order to make the deceased
more comfortable and secure she had
placed it in his name without receiving any payment. At that stage the mortgage
was about $27,000
and she and the deceased continued to pay it off. When they
got back together again they sold the property at Paddington and purchased
the
beach house property at Bondi for $148,000.  The source of the financing for
that were $85,000 from the proceeds of Paddington,
$40,000 from the parties'
joint savings and $23,000 as a gift from the defendant's father.
<P>

31  	     So far as the other assets are concerned, and these of
course are the flat and the $215,000 in trust, there is little
evidence as to
how these were accumulated, presumably by the deceased and the defendant. An
important aspect is that these funds
were held in trust for Peta and
Franchesca.  This really allows the burden of their education and maintenance
over the next few years
to be accommodated. It will require capital to be used
from time to time but it is sufficient. Importantly they were intended by
the
deceased and the defendant to be used for that purpose.
<P>

32  	     Here we are not dealing with a claim of a child which is
based upon what is sometimes referred to in cases as a matter
of paternity. The
plaintiff was separated from the deceased at an early age but this was not her
fault. There was communication throughout
the child's life. It was a two way
matter. Indeed Franchesca and Peta frequently wrote, no doubt encouraged by
their father, the
deceased. There were also the plans for the major trip to
reunite the plaintiff with her father.  These are not insignificant. Yet
the
deceased has not recognised the plaintiff in his will. This treatment of the
plaintiff is in marked contrast with the way the
deceased treated his own
children during his relationship with the defendant in his life time when he
put substantial sums away for
their future education at his own expense.
<P>

33  	     I do not suggest there should have been equal treatment
between the three girls. The sad fact is the plaintiff has been
for the
majority of her life part of another family unit. Her own mother has
responsibility towards her. The difficulty is with the
position of the
defendant. Fortunately, she has the unit. Given the level of the legacy, I am
considering she will have the option
of mortgaging that unit or selling it to
meet the legacy and costs.
<P>

34  	     It seems to me that the appropriate order, balancing all
the considerations and evidence, most of which I have referred
to, require that
there be a legacy in favour of the plaintiff in the sum of $35,000.
<P>

35  	     Accordingly, I order that the plaintiff receive out of the
estate of the deceased a legacy of $35,000.
<P>

36  	     So far as costs are concerned, there have been tendered
some letters concerning the need for the plaintiff and her mother
to come to
Australia. I do not think it is appropriate that I should resolve that matter.
It is really a matter for the costs assessor
in due course.
<P>

37  	     Accordingly, I order the costs of the plaintiff on a party
and party basis and the defendant on an indemnity basis be
paid or retained out
of the estate of the deceased.
