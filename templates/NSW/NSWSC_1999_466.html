<P>

<b>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

 
<P>

1	These proceedings arise out of a Statement of Claim by the plaintiff seeking
possession of premises under a mortgage and recovery
of a debt.
<P>

2	The proceedings, involving the Statement of Claim and the defences and the
cross-action thereto are still pending before the Court.
<P>

3	The plaintiff, by Notice of Motion, sought and obtained certain orders
restraining the First Defendant, by himself, his servants
or agents from
approaching, contacting, speaking to, communicating with or in any way
interfering with or intimidating any of a number
of specified persons
identified in a schedule to the orders sought.
<P>

4	Three of the persons named in that order received communication from the
First Defendant; one Mr Charles Perry, a letter on 18
December, 1997; another
witness, Mrs Judith Hermanson, two letters dated respectively 10 May 1998 and
19 June 1998; the First Defendant
also spoke to Mr Stephen Gurney on 19 July
1998 as a result of which the plaintiff has by Notice of Motion sought orders
that the
First Defendant be found guilty of contempt for failure to comply with
the order originally made by Simpson J and extended on 1 April,
1997 and
extended by Bruce J on 7 April 1997 and that the First Defendant be committed
to imprisonment for disobeying the orders
and that the First Defendant pay the
plaintiff's costs.
<P>

5	A Statement of Charge outlined the elements of the offence.
<P>

6	The plaintiff relied on a number of affidavits and, in particular, affidavits
by the three persons that I have referred to.  
Two of those witnesses were
subject to cross-examination, namely, Mr Perry and Mrs Hermanson.
<P>

7	The First Defendant was present in Court before Bruce J, as I have indicated,
and consented to the orders, and although the orders
were not read out it is
clear to me that he understood the intent and effect of those orders.
<P>

8	Proceedings for contempt are governed by Pt 55 SCR, which part of the rules
outlines the procedure to be adopted for proceedings
for contempt.
<P>

9	The evidence in these proceedings, in relation to Mr Perry, was that he
received a letter which is expressed to be "without prejudice",
a device which
is the First Defendant's usual practice. The letter threatens Mr Perry
personally for being involved in dealing with
fraudulent documents and accuses
Mr Perry of misleading the Court and to use solicitors to mislead the Court.
<P>

10	It contends that Mr Perry is acting incompetently and that he is knowingly
trying to sell property on fraudulent documentation,
and threatens that Mr
Perry will be taken to court.  Mr Perry's evidence was that he feels a
continuing threat to himself and his
family.
<P>

11	Mrs Hermanson's evidence was that the first letter that she received
purports to warn her that certain forgeries have occurred
using her signature,
and that the first defendant wished not to "ambush" her.  He then threatened
legal action against her if she
states that the signatures are hers.  The
letter goes on to say that it is not an attempt to intimidate.
<P>

12	The further letter she received purports to notify her that proceedings have
been commenced against her in the Federal Court
and attempts to direct her that
she cannot use solicitors Henry Davis York to represent her, nor can she accept
money from Westpac,
the plaintiff, until the case is over, and tells her that
she has been set up.
<P>

13	In the case of Mr Gurney, the contention is that in the case of Mr Gurney
the first defendant came to his home without appointment
or arrangement.  Mr
Bagshaw, the first defendant, said to Mr Gurney that he held documents proving
that documents had been tampered
with and that there was a conspiracy to "shut
me down".  The first defendant alleged that he could prove a signature had been
fraudulently
inserted in a mortgage, and that Mr Gurney would be subpoenaed.
When Mr Gurney told him he didn't wish to be discussing matters with
him at
home and that there was a restraining order against the first defendant, Mr
Gurney's evidence, that is that the first defendant
said "those sort of things
don't mean anything to me", that evidence is not disputed.  Although the first
defendant says he doesn't
remember it being said.
<P>

14	 Mr Gurney said he had been approached twice at home and feels a threat to
himself and his family.
<P>

15	The evidence of the three persons concerned was not challenged, except as to
the two witnesses Perry and Hermanson were challenged
as to whether their
expressed fears were in fact held as they alleged.  Although it is not an
element of the offence, I accept that
evidence, as I accept the evidence of
Hermanson, Perry and Gurney.  Bank officers or indeed anyone from private
industry or the public
service, who find that someone against whom their
employer is taking proceedings and have visits from that person at their home,
would quite reasonably feel apprehensive and be in fear, whether that fear is
reasonable or not.  People in dispute are not always
rational in the way they
do things, and the holding of fears does not have to be a rational activity and
I accept, although none
of the witnesses was terrified, that their concerns
were validly held, whether or not there was any basis for any such concern.
<P>

16	There is no dispute that the letters were written and that the conversation
occurred, and no evidence from the first defendant
who gave evidence in these
proceedings, challenges that fact.
<P>

17	It is contended on behalf of the first defendant that his actions were not
wilful or contumacious.  He has apologised to the
Court and has told the Court
that he did  not understand the significance of the orders of the Court. It is
put on his behalf that
the circumstances of the orders being made before Bruce
J would not necessarily have brought the matter to his mind, and that he
did
not properly comprehend the seriousness of the matter.  It is put that his
actions were not wilful, but casual or unintentional.
 He said that
conversation with Mr Gurney was cordial.
<P>

18	There is, in my view, no question that the actions taken by the first
defendant as contended, in fact occurred.  I find beyond
reasonable doubt that
the elements set out in the statement of charge are proved.  I find that the
first defendant understood the
nature of the orders that were made, although I
do accept, as submitted by Mr Young, that the real meaning of the orders might
not
necessarily have then brought the matter and the importance of the orders
to his mind.  I accept that, although his actions were
conscious and
deliberate, that the first defendant did not properly comprehend the
seriousness of the matter.  That, however, does
not excuse the fact that his
actions were intended to intimidate and deter the witnesses in relation to
anticipated evidence they
would be prepared to give in proceedings against
him.
<P>

19	Indeed, although the contempt alleged in the statement of charge was that
the first defendant was in breach of orders made by
the Court, his actions in
relation to Charles Perry and Judith Hermanson were such as were capable of
being in contempt of the Court,
even if those orders had not been made.
<P>

20	Contempt is of three natures:  It is either technical contempt; wilful
contempt; or contumacious contempt.  As I have found,
the contempt here goes
beyond technical contempt and was wilful on the part of the first defendant.
<P>

21	The difficulty in the law of contempt is to draw the line between wilful
contempt and contumacy.  In the latter case there must
be a conscious defiance
of the Court's authority.  It is, of course, difficult for the Court to treat a
matter of contempt where
a person has limited education.  Although Mr Bagshaw's
formal education is limited, he is certainly not inexperienced in the ways
of
the world and he is clearly intelligent enough to understand the nature of his
actions.  However, in determining the question
of contumacy, I take into
account the circumstances that, fundamentally the order of the Court was not in
fact read out to him, nor
was it formally served in the way that one would have
expected in a matter of this seriousness.
<P>

22	An unrepresented litigant cannot, in real terms, be expected to take a
matter as seriously as when he is represented and has
consequences of action
explained by a legal practitioner who represents him.
<P>

23	It is for this reason that I do not consider that the necessary element of
the offence has been made out to render the contempt
contumacious, but I find
beyond reasonable doubt that the contempt was wilful.
<P>

24	I therefore find the first defendant guilty of contempt.
<P>

                            oOo
<P>
