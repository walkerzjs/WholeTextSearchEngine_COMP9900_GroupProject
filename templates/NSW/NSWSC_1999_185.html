<P>

<b><u>11233/92 -	KERVAN TRADING PTY LTD v MERCANTILE MUTUAL INSURANCE
(AUSTRALIA) LTD</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  The plaintiff sues the defendant for the proceeds of a
fire insurance policy issued by the defendant and covering the contents of
the
plaintiff's shop, which was severely damaged by fire on 27 August 1989.  The
defendant admits the issue of the policy and that
the plaintiff suffered a
total loss.  The sum insured was $300,000.  The parties agree that the fire was
deliberately lit and the
only issue is whether the plaintiff had foreknowledge
of the fire.
<P>

2	There are two consequences when, as here, a defence of fraud is pleaded.
First, the issue must be tried by a jury: <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> s 88.  However,
although the matter was not dealt with formally, counsel informed the Court
that the parties consented to the matter
being tried without a jury.  I order
that all issues of fact be tried without a jury.
<P>

3	Secondly, the burden of proving fraud lies on the person who asserts it.  If,
as here, the asserted fraud is criminal in character,
it must be proved
strictly, because the degree of proof in a civil trial depends on the magnitude
of the thing that is in issue.

per Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ at 711.
<P>

4	In <b><u>Hornal v Neuberger Products</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1957%5d%201%20QB%20247" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1957] 1 QB 247</a> Denning LJ said
at 258:
<P>

The more serious the allegation the higher the degree of probability that is
required; but it need not, in a civil case, reach the
very high standard
required by the criminal law.
<P>

5	In <b><u>Briginshaw v Briginshaw &amp; Anor</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1938/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1938] HCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%2060%20CLR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1938) 60 CLR 336</a> Dixon J
said this at 361 -
<P>

The truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal
must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or
existence before it can be
found.  I cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of
probabilities independently of
any belief in its reality ...  But reasonable
satisfaction is not a state of mind that is obtained or established
independently of
the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved.
The seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of
an
occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing
from a particular finding are considerations which
must affect the answer to
the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction
of the tribunal.  In such
matters `reasonable satisfaction' should not be
produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect inferences.
<P>

6	The defendant must therefore establish to a high degree of probability that
the plaintiff knew that its shop was going to be set
on fire.  As will appear,
that will involve proof that its managing director and controlling officer, Mr
Kemal Kavurma, had that
knowledge.
<P>

7	At the time of the fire Mr Kavurma was the principal executive officer of the
plaintiff, having been appointed managing director
on 15 January 1985.  The
plaintiff carried on the business of importing Turkish and Greek videos,
copying and distributing them in
premises at 37 Queen Street Auburn.  It
occupied the rear of the ground floor of that premises.
<P>

8	Mr Kavurma became associated with the film or video business during the
1970s.  In 1980 he established a business called Akturk
Video at Auburn, hiring
out video cassettes to the public.  In October 1984 he acquired a controlling
interest in the plaintiff and
the plaintiff acquired the undertaking, equipment
and stock of Akturk Video.  The plaintiff owned a substantial number of master
video tapes and had exclusive distribution rights in Australia for films
present and future made by a number of producers.  Video
tapes were dubbed with
English or Greek subtitles and the plaintiff acquired special equipment for
that purpose.  In November 1998
it moved to occupy the rear portion of the
ground floor of 37 Queen Street Auburn.  It leased that part of the premises
from Auburn
United Friendly Society.
<P>

9	The front part of the ground floor was leased by Mr Kavurma and Mr Hassan
Atmali, the secretary of the plaintiff, for the conduct
of a business, called
Turkmen Video.  They had equal interests in that business, hiring out videos to
the general public.  Part of
the plaintiff's business consisted in the supply
of video tapes to Turkmen Video.
<P>

10	The first floor of the same premises was occupied by the owner as offices
and a pharmacy.  The whole of the premises, upstairs
and down, was fitted with
a burglar alarm system connected to the office of a security organisation,
Kanimbla Security Proprietary
Limited, which maintained and monitored it.
<P>

11	On 27 August 1989 Mr Kavurma left the shop by the front door in the company
of Mr Mehmet Atmali, the brother of Hassan Atmali.
Records of Kanimbla Security
show that the alarm was turned on at 10.46 pm.  The shop was well on fire by
midnight.
<P>

12	Mr Jeffrey Gudmann, a consultant in fire and explosion investigations, gave
evidence.  His qualifications and conclusions were
not challenged.  A plan
annexed to his report shows that the premises comprises a narrow building whose
long axis runs approximately
south-north at right angles to Queen Street.  The
front of the premises, which was occupied by Turkmen Video, is wider than the
rear.
 Mr Kavurma and the plaintiff's employees had to walk through that
portion to enter and leave the building by the front door.  The
alarm board for
all parts of the ground floor was in the front of the premises.  Behind the
counter at the rear of that portion was
a door giving access to a narrower
portion of the building which comprised three rooms in a row.  The first
contained shelving with
equipment, tapes and the like and a table, and led on
to the second.  The second led onto the third.
<P>

13	Two independent seats of fire were established, one in the first of these
rooms and the other in the second.  Both seats were
close to the eastern
exterior wall.
<P>

14	Altogether there were eight openings in the exterior brick wall through
which it might have been possible to gain access to the
first and second rooms.
Two of them were the front doors leading on to Queen Street.  There was a
single door in the western wall
behind the front portion of the premises
leading directly on to the first room.  The evidence conclusively establishes
that none
of those doors was forced.  The third room, which was used for
storage, contained a door and a window.  The door was locked and padlocked
and
permanently nailed shut.  There were tool marks on the door, as though someone
had tried to jemmy it open, but it is not possible
to say when they were made.
The evidence shows that the door was not open immediately before or during the
fire.  In the same room
was a window, and that showed no sign of forced entry.
Of course, there was no seat of fire in that room.
<P>

15	The seat of fire in the second room was close by the only opening in the
exterior wall, a window.  Although it had been protected
originally by a stout
wire mesh, by the time Mr Gudmann made his inspection the mesh had been pulled
out of place.  The window was
broken, of course, and that could have happened
before the fire began.  Samples taken at the seat of that fire showed that
petrol
had been used to start it.  Clearly enough, some petrol soaked and
lighted object could have been dropped through the window to the
point where
the fire began.
<P>

16	The first room contained two exterior wall openings, a boarded up window and
a boarded-up door.  There was no sign of forced
entry of the window.  There was
an air conditioning unit fitted to the upper portion of the door.  Above the
door and the unit was
a small window, hinged at the bottom and opening inwards.
It was originally protected by wire mesh.  At the time of Mr Gudmann's
inspection, the mesh had been detached at its lower fixing points.  The seat of
the fire was more or less directly under the window.
 The exterior part of the
air conditioning unit had a flat top, and lying on it Mr Gudmann found pieces
of partially burnt cloth.
 Tests showed that they contained petrol residue.  On
the ground next to the door were two stacked bottle crates upon which someone
could have stood to gain access to the window above.
<P>

17	According to Mr Gudmann, the proprietor of the video shop told him that
before the fire a timber wall lining had covered the
window.  However, Mr
Gudmann found only a few remnants of the lining, none of them close to the
window, so it is not possible to
say how efficiently the window was covered
internally.  There was no evidence whether it could have been opened far enough
to allow
anyone to pour petrol through it or drop a lighted cloth onto the
floor from outside the building.  However, the lining would not
have extended
below the bottom of the hinged frame because the air conditioning unit was
there.  It seems possible for the fire to
have started in such a manner.
<P>

18	Near the seat of the fire in that room was found a broken glass vase into
the neck of which there had been stuffed a roll of
video cassette labels.  The
vase contained petrol residue.  It contained very little sooty deposit on the
underside of its base,
which suggested that it might have been standing upright
during the fire.  In the same place was a coffee table, though by the time
Mr
Gudmann inspected, the vase was broken and underneath the table.  It is
impossible to say whether the vase was used in some way
to start the fire and,
if so, whether it was introduced from outside the building, or whether it might
have been originally standing
on the coffee table or whether petrol was
introduced by pouring through the window or by some other means or deliberately
or accidentally.
 Mr Gudmann offered no opinion.  Counsel made no submissions
about the part played by the vase.
<P>

19	I conclude that it was possible for an accelerant and a source of heat to be
introduced from outside the building adjacent to
each of the two seats of fire
and that that is probably how the fire began.
<P>

20	Mr David Rath, general manager of Kanimbla Security, gave evidence.  He said
that the alarm detectors at the front of the premises
were set to delay the
raising of the alarm for a short time to allow persons to enter and leave the
premises at the opening and close
of work.  Detectors in the three rooms
occupied by the plaintiff would have triggered sirens instantly if they had
detected the presence
of any person or object.  Any detector raising the alarm
would have brought into operation an automatic dialling system by which
the
alarm would have been raised at the premises of Kanimbla Security.  Such a
signal would also have been sent to Kanimbla Security
if the power had been
turned off or the external siren interfered with.
<P>

21	The records of Kanimbla Security showed no malfunction after the alarm was
turned on.  Although the system components were damaged
by fire, Mr Rath
detected nothing about them that would suggest that they were not working
properly at the time of the fire.  However,
no signal was received by Kanimbla
Security.
<P>

22	The damage to the rear rooms of the premises was severe and the upstairs
offices had already begun to sustain serious damage
above the second room.  The
alarms in both premises should have sent independent signals to Kanimbla
Securities.  The only explanation
Mr Rath could put forward why they did not
was that the telephone lines, which were the means by which the automatic
signal was sent
to Kanimbla Securities, must have been severed outside the
building.  Unfortunately, he did not look to see whether this was so.
 Even so,
that seems to be the only reasonable explanation for the failure of the
system.
<P>

23	The defendant submitted that Mr Kavurma had a motive to burn the premises
and claim the proceeds of the policy, relying on evidence
of his and the
plaintiff's financial position before and at the time of the fire.
<P>

24	Following the fire Mr Kavurma signed a number of documents, namely a
statement to the police on 28 August, a statement to an
insurance investigator,
Mr Thomas, on 30 August and two records of interviews between himself and Mr
Thomas on 30 October and 2 November
1989 respectively.  In these documents Mr
Kavurma made a number of significant statements about his and the plaintiff's
financial
affairs.
<P>

25	He said that the plaintiff had had the lease of a $60,000 subtitling machine
but fell behind in the payment of instalments, and
that the lessor repossessed
it in 1986.  The plaintiff borrowed $50,000 from Mr James Fuggle in the same
year.  The loan was not
fully repaid by the time of the fire.  At that time,
the plaintiff owed about $100,000 in loans made by solicitor and private
lenders.
<P>

26	Mr Kavurma himself owed the balance of a judgment debt in the District
Court, to Roscoe WG Hoyle &amp; Co, solicitors, whom he
had instructed to act
for Akturk Video Pty Limited in proceedings in the Equity Division of this
Court and in the Supreme Court of
Victoria.  The solicitors obtained judgment
for approximately $70,000 and there was still some $40,000 owing at the time of
the fire.
 It is unclear, however, whether Mr Kavurma included his $40,000
personal debt in the $100,000 he told Mr Thomas the plaintiff owed.
<P>

27	In February 1986 a company called TBE Pty Limited sold and delivered to the
plaintiff a number of video cassette recorders and
other electrical equipment
for $19,000.  The money was never paid and TBE obtained judgment against the
plaintiff in 1988.  Judgment
was never satisfied and a writ of execution was
issued.  A number of conversations followed between Mr Kavurma and Mr John
Marsden,
the principle of TBE Pty Limited, during which Mr Kavurma first tried
to pass off responsibility for the debt to a man in Melbourne
with whom he had
a dispute, the subject of separate court proceedings, and then said that he and
the plaintiff had no money.  He
advised Mr Marsden to write off the debt.
<P>

28	In a written report to the National Companies and Securities Commission,
signed by Mr Kavurma on 18 May 1987, the stock was valued
at $300,000 but its
realisable value at only 10% of that amount.
<P>

29	During 1989 Direct Acceptance Corporation Limited served a notice of demand
on Mr Kavurma following his personal guarantee to
it concerning the debts of
Akturk Video Proprietary Limited and Akturk's default.  Some $10,000 was
demanded.  It was not suggested
that Mr Kavurma had any defence.
<P>

30	As at the date of the fire there were fixed and floating charges registered
over the assets of the plaintiff for $37,000 owed
to Direct Acceptance
Corporation and $50,000 owed to Mr Fuggle.  Mr Kavurma told Mr Thomas that the
charges were enough to discourage
lenders from advancing any more money to the
plaintiff.
<P>

31	The trading results of the plaintiff were poor.  For the 1985 financial year
there was a net loss of $24,753, for 1986 a net
loss of $12,236, for 1987 a net
loss of $48,397, for 1988 a net profit of $27,283 and for 1989 a net loss of
$10,933.  Accumulated
losses at 30 June 1989 were $69,036.
<P>

32	Although the plaintiff had a bank account at the State Bank of New South
Wales at Auburn there was no movement on that account
for the six months
immediately before the fire.  On a number of occasions debts of the plaintiff
were paid by cheques drawn on the
account of Turkmen Video.
<P>

33	Mr Kavurma was the majority shareholder in the plaintiff, holding about
210,000 ordinary shares as against other holdings totalling
about 70,000
shares.  He told Mr Thomas that he had sunk into the plaintiff's business
$296,000, which he had obtained from the sale
of a former video shop business,
a farm, a crop and from a personal borrowing of $50,000.
<P>

34	Apart from his interest in the plaintiff and Turkmen Video, which appeared
to have minimal assets and to have an overdraft of
$85,000 and other debts, Mr
Kavurma's only assets seem to have been his interest in the contents of his and
his wife's house.  His
wife owned a 12 year old Mercedes Benz motor vehicle.
They had virtually no money in the bank.
<P>

35	Mr Kavurma told the police that at the time of the fire the plaintiff had no
reserve funds and all its money was tied up in stock
at the Queen Street
premises.
<P>

36	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that Mr Kavurma had no motive to
destroy the assets of the business.  The defendant's
admission that the
plaintiff suffered a loss of no less than $300,000 in the fire amounted, it was
submitted, to an admission that
the plaintiff had substantial assets.  It was
submitted that Mr Kavurma had been in the video business for years and
re-opened a
video shop almost immediately after the fire in the same district.
His preparedness to recommence a similar business to similar customers
showed
that he was confident that his business could trade profitably.  It was further
submitted that it would have been a huge risk
to liquidate the substantial
assets of the plaintiff by means of the fire and the insurance claim because
that would have made it
easier for the creditors of the plaintiff to get their
hands on the money.
<P>

37	As will appear, however, Mr Kavurma set up in business again only by the use
of $25,000 which he borrowed and never repaid. 
I have difficulty in accepting
those submissions.
<P>

38	There were other submissions, too, which I do not accept.  The first was
that Mr Kavurma's starting up business again, combined
with the fact that this
was a cash business, suggested that the business might not have been as
unprofitable as counsel for the defendant
contended.  Such a submission carries
with it at least the implication that much of what Mr Kavurma certified as true
in official
documents was not in fact true.
<P>

39	On the whole of this evidence I accept the submission of the defendant that
the business was chronically starved of ready money
and I think that it might
have suited Mr Kavurma's interests to convert the contents of the business to
cash.
<P>

40	The defendant's two principal witnesses were Miss Semra Yuksel and her
mother, Mrs Emine Yuksel.  Miss Yuksel met Mr Kavurma
in 1982 when she was 20
years old and began working for him full time at the premises where Akturk
Video was then operating.  She
was paid in cash.  Soon afterwards, Mr Kavurma
formed a partnership with a man called Sogutlu, but it did not last long, and
after
the rift Miss Yuksel worked for Mr Sogutlu.  She left his employment in
about 1987 and after a short period of unemployment began
working again for Mr
Kavurma at Turkmen Video.  She continued to work for him until after the fire.
Part of her job was to deal with
telephone callers, particularly suppliers of
video tapes and video tape recorders who wanted their bills paid.  Mr Kavurma
would
often ask her to put them off, saying that he was not there or giving
other excuses.
<P>

41	Miss Yuksel met Mr Atmali in 1985 and by the time of the fire had been in a
sexual relationship with him for some time, perhaps
two years.  Miss Yuksel
lived with her mother.  Mr Atmali and Mr Kavurma were in the habit of calling
in regularly.  Mr Atmali used
to stay overnight several nights each week.  Mrs
Yuksel disapproved of the relationship because Mr Atmali was married.
<P>

42	On 19 June 1989 Miss Yuksel went to Turkey for a holiday and to visit
members of her family and did not return to Australia until
9 September 1989, a
few days after the fire.
<P>

43	According to Mrs Yuksel, Mr Kavurma and Mr Atmali went to her house about
four weeks after Miss Yuksel left for Turkey.  She
had $4,000 in a bank account
and they knew about it, though she could not say how and assumed that she must
have mentioned the fact
at some time.  They told her that they wanted to buy
cassettes for the video shop and asked her to lend them the $4,000.  They said
they would repay her with interest.  She agreed and they took her to the
Commonwealth Bank at Lidcombe and she withdrew the money
and handed it to them.
About a year later Mr Atmali telephoned her and told her that the money was
being repaid.  Mr Kavurma repaid
the $4,000 without interest.
<P>

44	Mrs Yuksel went on to say that about one week before the fire the two men
again visited her house and Mr Atmali said to her in
the presence of Mr Kavurma
-
<P>

"Mummy, we need the key to your garage to store something in it."
<P>

45	Mrs Yuksel agreed and gave them a key.  Over the following three nights the
two men placed in the garage a number of cardboard
boxes which they brought in
Mr Atmali's car.  They were stored along three walls of the garage.  She did
not speak to them about
the boxes as they were delivered, but had a look at
them after delivery was complete.  She opened a box and saw a machine that
looked
like a video cassette recorder.  She did not open any other box, but
some of them were old and imperfectly sealed and she could see
video cassette
boxes inside them.
<P>

46	Although Mrs Yuksel telephoned Miss Yuksel in Turkey she did not tell her
about the fire.  Miss Yuksel found out about it in
a telephone conversation
with Mr Atmali.  He simply told her that the shop had burnt and gave her no
information about the cause
of the fire.
<P>

47	Mr Atmali collected Miss Yuksel from the airport on her return and drove her
to her mother's house.  On the way she suggested
to him that he had been
involved in the lighting of the fire.  He did not deny the suggestion and said
that they were already renting
a new shop and were going to get lots of
money.
<P>

48	On the same day Miss Yuksel went into the garage and saw the boxes to which
her mother referred in her evidence.  She looked
into one or two of them and
saw that they were full of video cassettes.  One of them contained two pieces
of equipment that had been
at the Queen Street premises before she left for
Turkey.  One was a machine used to write the name Turkmen Video onto the
beginning
of video tapes.  That I take it is the same as the equipment also
called a titling machine.  The box contained another piece of equipment
that
Miss Yuksel recognised.  It had coloured buttons along its face.
<P>

49	The video tapes that Miss Yuksel saw were from the shop and she could
identify labelling in the handwriting of Mr Kavurma, Mr
Atmali or their
employees.
<P>

50	Miss Yuksel went on to say that on the following day she went to the new
shop which Mr Kavurma and Mr Atmali were in the process
of setting up in Auburn
Road, Auburn.  They had kept the name Turkmen Video.  Mr Kavurma and Mr Atmali
were there alone and a conversation
took place between them and Miss Yuksel as
she helped them.  Although it was put to her that she had played no part in the
setting
up of the shop, I prefer her evidence that she did.  Ex G is a
photograph of her in the process of doing so.
<P>

51	In the conversation Mr Kavurma said words like these -
<P>

We're going to get a lot of money out of this fire.  I felt a bit bad when I
came to the front of the shop and I saw that it was
on fire.  I know that I
arranged for the fire to be lit and that I knew it was going to happen but I
still felt bad about it.  I
tried to get into the shop when I arrived but the
police wouldn't let me and told me it was because of the fire.
<P>

52	Miss Yuksel said -
<P>

Why did you store your stuff in my mother's place.  Why didn't you go to one of
your relatives?
<P>

53	Mr Kavurma replied -
<P>

The insurance company would have searched the homes of my relatives.  I didn't
think they would search your mother's place because
you were overseas.  When we
get the money I will buy you a unit.
<P>

54	Miss Yuksel spoke to Mr Kavurma a number of times.  He often expressed
concern to her about the progress of the insurance claim
and said things like
-
<P>

When I was organising the fire I was concerned that the junkie who we had
organised to light it may be observed by someone.
<P>

I am concerned that someone might talk to the insurance company and let them
know about me such as Senay or Nihat Karci.
<P>

55	Senay was a former girlfriend with whom Mr Kavurma had a dispute.  Mr Karci
was apparently a man with whom Mr Kavurma had a business
dispute.
<P>

56	The new shop began to trade about six weeks after the fire.  Having helped
in the setting up of the shop, Miss Yuksel worked
there when the business
opened.  Mr Atmali brought to the shop the two pieces of equipment that she had
seen in her garage.  The
video cassettes that she had seen, however, remained
in the garage until about six months after the fire.
<P>

57	Other equipment and video cassettes which Miss Yuksel had not seen before
arrived at the shop, and I accept that this may have
been brought by Mr Kavurma
or Mr Atmali from a shop in Melbourne in which they had an interest and which
had closed down.
<P>

58	About six or seven months after the fire Mr Kavurma told Miss Yuksel that he
did not trust her any more and thought that she
might talk to people about the
fire and what he and Mr Atmali had done.  A few days later Mr Atmali began
moving the boxes of video
tapes out of Mrs Yuksel's garage.  They were moved
into the new business and Miss Yuksel recognised them there.  She asked Mr
Kavurma
why he was using material from the old business and he replied to the
effect -
<P>

They wouldn't know.  If they ask me about it I will tell them I bought it.
<P>

59	In order to set up the new business Mr Kavurma and Mr Atmali borrowed a
substantial amount of money, including $25,000 from Miss
Yuksel.  They signed a
document, a copy of which was annexed to Miss Yuksel's statement and which did
not come under challenge, by
which they promised to repay her $30,000.  The
difference represented interest.  Miss Yuksel was never repaid.
<P>

60	None of the evidence shows that Mr Kavurma could not have been knowingly
concerned in the arrangements that were made for the
fire to be set, and I am
satisfied that he had a motive to be concerned in those arrangements.  However,
I agree with the submissions
of counsel on both sides that the defendant cannot
prove fraud unless I accept the evidence of Miss and Mrs Yuksel.
<P>

61	It is necessary before I deal with the criticisms made of their evidence to
say something of the circumstances in which they
came to make their statements
to a representative of the defendant.  Miss Yuksel said in her statement,
Exhibit B dated 17 February
1998, that for much of 1990 and 1991 she was not
paid as she continued to work for Mr Kavurma and Mr Atmali.  During 1991 Mr
Kavurma
terminated her services.  The promise by Mr Kavurma and Mr Atmali was
to repay her the $30,000 no later than 1 July 1991.  Although
Miss Yuksel could
not accurately state the time, it was when she realised that she was not likely
to get her money back that she
spoke to a police officer about the matter.  She
knew the name of the police sergeant who had been concerned in part of the
dispute
between Mr Kavurma and his former girlfriend (who had apparently
obtained an apprehended domestic violence order or some similar
order against
him in the Local Court), telephoned the police station and asked for him.  He
came to her house and she told him the
whole story, including the confessions
Mr Atmali and Mr Kavurma had made to her.  The sergeant did not record their
conversation
in any notebook and she was never asked to sign a written
statement.
<P>

62	There was no evidence of precisely when or how Miss Yuksel came to give
information to the defendant.  She made a statement in
September 1996, but that
document did not come into evidence.  The best Miss Yuksel was able to say was
that her first contact with
anyone on behalf of the defendant would have been
some time after 1994, after her relationship with Mr Atmali had come to an end.
Up to that time nobody from the insurer had asked her to make a statement.
<P>

63	Mrs Yuksel's evidence contained some differences from Miss Yuksel's.  In the
first place, she was not prepared to admit that
Mr Atmali ever stayed overnight
at her house.  She seemed reluctant to admit that their relationship before the
fire had been a sexual
one.  Her evidence was that after the fire Miss Yuksel
continued her relationship with him in the hope of getting her money back.
 She
said that she herself maintained friendly relations with Mr Atmali until it
became obvious that Miss Yuksel was not going to
be paid.  She was asked
whether she hated Mr Atmali and her reply was to the effect that she hated him
and Mr Kavurma because they
had organised between themselves to take money from
Miss Yuksel and had spent it.  She said that they must be punished for what
they
had done.
<P>

64	It was submitted that the Court ought not to accept Mrs Yuksel's evidence on
critical matters in view of her hatred of Mr Kavurma,
her wish to see him
punished and her refusal on oath to admit that Mr Atmali had slept with Miss
Yuksel at her house.  It was further
submitted that Mrs Yuksel had on her own
account, as was the case, admitted that if Mr Kavurma's claim had been paid by
the defendant
and he had repaid Miss Yuksel out of the proceeds, they would
never have reported the matter.
<P>

65	Although Mrs Yuksel was unprepared to admit something that must have been
obvious to her, namely the fact that Mr Atmali slept
with Miss Yuksel at her
house, I think that this says more about her culture and morals than about her
general standard of honesty.
 She came to Australia from Turkey when Miss
Yuksel was fifteen years old.  Her husband had died when Miss Yuksel was only
two years
old.  She strongly disapproved of the relationship because Mr Atmali
was a married man.  She must have found the fact of the relationship
shameful
and I think that that may explain why she was not prepared to admit the
obvious.  Of course, the question whether or not
Mr Atmali stayed overnight at
Mrs Yuksel's house had no particular relevance to the things she said Mr
Kavurma had said and done.
<P>

66	Mrs Yuksel's frank admission of her hatred of Mr Atmali and her wish to see
him punished and her frank acknowledgment that she
would not have reported the
matter to the insurance company if Miss Yuksel had been repaid her $30,000 do
not cause me to doubt her
honesty in her account about what Mr Kavurma did and
said.  I observed her demeanour closely and I found her forthrightness
refreshing.
 I do not consider it a fair statement to say that she and Miss
Yuksel were prepared to receive an advantage from a fraudulent insurance
claim
instead of reporting the matter to the authorities.  They had no obligation to
report the matter to the insurer.  Miss Yuksel
had reported the matter to the
police.  The fraud was not theirs and I find it entirely understandable that,
knowing what she did,
Mrs Yuksel might stand back and do nothing in the hope
that her daughter might receive her money.
<P>

67	Mrs Yuksel was next attacked about evidence she gave about a conversation
with Mr Atmali.  She said that when she first heard
about the fire it was an
accident, as far as she knew.  About a week later Mr Atmali came to her house
and the first thing she said
to him was-
<P>

"Aren't you ashamed to burn your store?  How could you do this?  Aren't you
afraid of God?"
<P>

68	She was cross-examined about that conversation and admitted that when she
made her accusation she did not know whether Mr Atmali
had burnt the shop or
not.
<P>

69	The submission was that her evidence was incredible.  I do not accept the
submission.  Miss Yuksel had worked for Mr Atmali and
Mr Kavurma for years and
had been on intimate relations with Mr Atmali for a long time.  She was well
aware of the shortcomings of
their businesses and the serious and chronic
financial difficulties that Mr Atmali and Mr Kavurma were constantly facing.
All the
time she and her mother shared a house and apparently agreeable
relations.  It would be surprising if her mother did not know about
the
financial position of the businesses.
<P>

70	Although Mr Kavurma denied it, I accept Mrs Yuksel's evidence that he and Mr
Atmali found it necessary to borrow $4,000 from
her during Miss Yuksel's
absence in Turkey.  They were always borrowing to cover their shortage of
money.  Although it is obvious
that Mrs Yuksel wants the plaintiff to lose this
action, I do not think that she would lie in order to ensure it.  Moreover, if
she
invented a story about their borrowing $4,000 she would not invent another
about its repayment.
<P>

71	The $4,000 loan must have made the serious financial position of the
plaintiff uppermost in Mrs Yuksel's mind on the first occasion
when she spoke
to Mr Atmali after the fire.  Although, as she said, she did not know that he
had set fire to the shop, she must have
had a very shrewd idea that some such
thing had happened.  I find her accusation consistent with her forthright
manner in the witness
box.  I think that she did say such a thing to Mr Atmali,
and not without reason.
<P>

72	The next criticism was that although the fire and Mr Atmali's admission
about it were matters of importance to her, she never
told Miss Yuksel about
them on the telephone.  I do not find her evidence incredible or inconsistent.
Mrs Yuksel said that once every
fortnight or once a month she telephoned Miss
Yuksel in Turkey.  I accept Miss Yuksel's evidence that her mother did not
telephone
very often.  By the time Mrs Yuksel found out about the fire and
spoke to Mr Atmali, Miss Yuksel was within a few days of leaving
Turkey to
return to Sydney.  It is by no means clear that the two spoke on the telephone
within the last few days of Miss Yuksel's
absence.  In cross-examination Mrs
Yuksel said that she might have, because she placed an order with Miss Yuksel
for things she wanted
her to bring home, but I think that it was only surmise.
I accept the evidence of both witnesses that they did not discuss the fire
on
the telephone.
<P>

73	The next criticism was based upon a comparison between the evidence of Mrs
Yuksel and Miss Yuksel about whether Mrs Yuksel told
Miss Yuksel about Mr
Atmali's confession as soon as she came home.  Mrs Yuksel said she did.  Miss
Yuksel said that she did not,
though she said that there had been a
conversation between her and Mr Atmali in the car on the way home from the
airport about the
fire.
<P>

74	There is an inconsistency, as counsel has observed, but it does not cause me
to doubt Mrs Yuksel's honesty.  These matters are
more concerned, I think with
accuracy and the sheer ability to recollect events ten years after they
happened.
<P>

75	The next attack on Mrs Yuksel's evidence concerned alleged differences
between what she had said in her statement and what she
said in
cross-examination.  In her statement she said that her friendship towards Mr
Kavurma and Mr Atmali ceased after the fire.
 In her evidence she said that she
had remained friendly until her daughter broke off relations with Mr Atmali.
<P>

76	I think that there is a discrepancy, but it does not cause me to doubt Mrs
Yuksel's honesty.  Her comment was that she may have
misunderstood what she was
being asked when she prepared her statement, and that might well be so.
<P>

77	The next attack was on her evidence about the repayment of the loan of
$4,000.  In her statement she said that it was repaid
about one year later by
Mr Atmali.  In cross-examination she said it was Mr Kavurma who repaid the
money.  In further explanation
she said that Mr Kavurma telephoned her telling
her that he had sent the money and that Mr Atmali handed it to her.  I have
already
said why I am satisfied that Mrs Yuksel is telling the truth about the
loan.
<P>

78	The next attack compared the versions given by Mrs and Miss Yuksel
respectively of the appearance of the boxes that Mr Kavurma
and Mr Atmali had
put in the garage.  The submission was that they could not stand together.  Mrs
Yuksel's evidence may be summarised
as that boxes were stacked from floor to
ceiling along three sides of the garage.  Miss Yuksel's evidence was that the
boxes went
to shoulder height on two sides of the garage.  If that were all
there was to it, the discrepancy might be significant, but it is
not.  Proper
allowance has to be made for the failure of memory after such a long time.
Secondly, as Miss Yuksel made clear, there
were things in the garage which
belonged to her.  She was never asked whether the boxes which had arrived in
her absence, together
with her own possessions, filled all three sides of the
garage.  The evidence was left unclear.
<P>

79	The asserted discrepancies do not cause me to doubt the evidence of Mrs
Yuksel.
<P>

80	The first submission about Miss Yuksel was that her demeanour was that of a
reluctant and unwilling person.  I do not agree.
 I found her evidence
impressive.  She could not remember the detail of her statement without being
allowed to refer to it, but that
did not cause me to doubt her honesty.  I
thought that at one stage, after some hours of cross-examination, she showed
signs of nerves
and frustration, but I put that down to the unfamiliarity to
her of the position she found herself in.
<P>

81	Like Mrs Yuksel, Miss Yuksel was criticised for being prepared to stand by
and, if it materialised, receive an advantage from
a fraudulent insurance
claim.  I repeat the remarks I made about Mrs Yuksel in that respect.
<P>

82	Miss Yuksel's identification of the titling machine in the garage was
challenged.  It was submitted that the defendant had called
no evidence to show
that no titling machine had been found at the burnt out premises.  It was
pointed out that the machine was listed
in the schedule of damaged items in the
claim form and that the defendant had admitted a total loss.  It is not clear
to me that
any titling machine was found in the debris.  Mr Kavurma said so,
but I do not accept his evidence.  The defendant's admission of
a total loss
did not imply any acceptance that the titling machine itself was lost.
<P>

83	I am satisfied that Miss Yuksel saw the titling machine in the garage.
<P>

84	Miss Yuksel's evidence about her interview with the police sergeant was said
to be "implausible in the extreme" and unsupported
by any documents produced by
the Commissioner of Police on subpoena.  Counsel for the defendant conceded
that no such documents had
been produced.  However, Miss Yuksel's account if
true makes it quite unlikely that any document ever came into existence.  She
said,
and was not tested about this, that the sergeant made no note in any
official police notebook and that she was not asked to sign
a written
statement.  The sergeant was not involved in the fire investigation, if it was
still current at that time, but only concerned
with the dispute between Mr
Kavurma and his former girlfriend.  I think that the fact that no documents
were produced by the Commissioner
for Police takes the matter nowhere.  There
is nothing else that is inherently unbelievable about her account of her
conversation
with the police sergeant.
<P>

85	Finally it was submitted that evidence of Mr Erdem, whose impartiality and
truthfulness were not attacked, also served to refute
the evidence of Mrs
Yuksel and Miss Yuksel.  Mr Erdem runs a video business in Brunswick,
Melbourne.  He has known Mr Kavurma and
Mr Atmali for some time and was
involved in copyright litigation against them.  More recently, they set up a
shop in Melbourne in
1988 and he saw them there and gave them some
assistance.
<P>

86	He visited their shop and saw video cassettes there.  The shop traded for
about a year.  At one time Mr Erdem was told that there
had been a fire in Mr
Kavurma's shop in Sydney and he spoke to him about it on the phone.  The
Melbourne shop was then closed and
Mr Kavurma and Mr Atmali took the video
tapes that were there.  Mr Erdem went to the new business of Mr Kavurma in
Sydney and had
a look at the video tapes that were there.  He saw labels that
he had seen in Melbourne.  They were one centimetre by one and a half
centimetres and yellow.  He asked Mr Kavurma why he had not taken them off and
the reply was that they were very hard to remove.
<P>

87	In fact this evidence is capable of bearing only on the evidence of Miss
Yuksel.  But her evidence was that the material stored
in her garage stayed
there for six months after the fire and that when the new shop was set up other
equipment and video cassettes
were brought into the shop.  She did not know
where they had been stored.
<P>

88	She was asked in cross-examination about the stocking of the new shop
immediately after the fire, that is within the six-month
period during which
she said the tapes from the old shop remained in her mother's garage, and she
said that she did not know where
the stock came from.
<P>

89	There is no conflict between her evidence and Mr Erdem's.  
<P>

90	Mr Kavurma gave evidence and denied that he had any knowledge that the
premises was to be burnt.  He denied storing any material
in Mrs Yuksel's
garage and denied the admissions Miss Yuksel said that he had made.  Although
much of his evidence was interpreted
from Turkish, a significant part was given
in English and I formed the impression that his understanding of English was
reasonably
good.
<P>

91	He began to be cross-examined about statements he had made and I think that
he must have realised that his attention was going
to be drawn to things he had
said that might not help his case.  He was shown a copy of the statement he
signed for Mr Thomas on
30 August 1989.  These questions and answers followed
-
<P>

Q.  In connection with the insurance company's investigation, you spoke with or
were interviewed by Mr Thomas on a number of occasions?
<P>

A.  Yes, without an interpreter ...
<P>

Q.  Looking at the document ... do you recognise that document?
<P>

A.  They wrote it themselves.
<P>

92	Mr Kavurma agreed that Mr Atmali had been present.  These questions and
answers followed -
<P>

Q.  But from time to time you asked Mr Atmali to interpret for you, is that
correct?
<P>

A.  Atmali doesn't speak more than I do, English.
<P>

Q.  Will you answer my question, from time to time did Mr Atmali interpret for
you during the interview with Mr Thomas?
<P>

A.  (Not through interpreter) No, never.
<P>

...
<P>

Q.  Did you read this statement that we are looking at before you signed each
page of it?
<P>

A.  I read it but I didn't understand the entire context of it.
<P>

Q.  Did you discuss the contents with Mr Atmali where you didn't understand
them?
<P>

A.  No, I did not, because his reading in English is worse than mine, or me,
that his primary - he just completed the primary school
education but I have
left university.
<P>

93	Mr Kavurma went on to say that he signed the document without understanding
the entire context of it.  He said that perhaps he
had asked for an
interpreter, he did not remember.  He was then reminded of the text of an
interview of 30 October 1989 which he
had signed.  Questions 2 and 3 were as
follows -
<P>

Q2.  As on the last occasion, Mr. Hassan Atmali is present during this
interview today.  I understand that whilst you have a reasonably
good command
of the English language, you require Mr. Atmali to be present in order that he
can translate for you, where necessary.
 Is that correct.
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

Q3.  Feel free to confer with Mr. Atmali before answering any questions, if you
so desire.  Are you satisfied that Mr. Atmali is
fluent on both the English and
Turkish languages.
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

94	Those questions and answers were translated into Turkish for Mr Kavurma, and
he responded -
<P>

It can't be, he speaks English but he can't read English.
<P>

95	He was asked why he answered question 3 in the affirmative if it was untrue
and responded that Mr Thomas just asked him to sign
the pages in a row.  His
attention was then drawn to a third document, a record of a conversation that
had taken place with Mr Thomas
on 2 November 1989 at which his solicitor, Mr
Foley, had been present.  He was asked whether he had brought his lawyer to the
next
meeting with Mr Thomas and he denied it.  He was asked whether Mr Foley
had been there and he agreed.  He was asked whether he and
Mr Foley discussed
whether he needed an interpreter and he said that he did not remember.  It was
suggested to him that he told Mr
Foley that he did not need an interpreter and
his response was -
<P>

How can I say that?
<P>

96	The record, which is signed by Mr Kavurma, contains the following question
and answer -
<P>

Q2.  I further indicated at the time of terminating (the interview of 30
October 1989) that I would provide the services of an interpreter
at the time
of my further interview with you.  I have been advised my Mr. Foley that the
services of an interpreter are not required.
 Is that correct?
<P>

A.  Yes.
<P>

97	He was then asked these questions and gave answers in cross-examination -
<P>

Q.  Do you accept that Mr Thomas said that to you given that those words are in
question 2?
<P>

A.  If it was true then he should have brought an interpreter.
<P>

Q.  Did you answer Mr Thomas when he asked you to confirm that an interpreter
was not required?
<P>

A.  Even today we are using an interpreter, how can then, how can I say yes to
that?
<P>

98	I formed the view that Mr Kavurma was prepared to give evasive answers if he
thought that the truth might hurt his case.
<P>

99	In a statement he signed for the police on 28 August 1989 Mr Kavurma said
this about the circumstances in which he left the premises
on the night of the
fire -
<P>

... and I closed the store about 10.30pm that night.  When I closed the shop I
was with Mehmet Atmali, a brother of the company
secretary.  Before I left I
checked all the windows and doors were locked.  I then went to a pizza shop in
Auburn Road, with Mehmet,
and two other people who were there when I locked up,
one is Fazli Yilmaz and Saadlaah Vatensever.  After a coffee I went home to
Burwood.  I arrived about 11pm.
<P>

100	However, on 30 August he said this to Mr Thomas -
<P>

It was about 10.30pm, that Sadullah Vatatsever and myself left the shop, and
went to the nearby coffee lounge, in Auburn Road. 
We left Mehmet Atmali and
Fazli Yilmaz at the shop, and Mehmet was to set the burglar alarm and secure
the premises.  Mehmet often
helped us at the shop, and knew what to do to
secure the premises and set the burglar alarm.  I left him with the keys to the
premises
and the alarm.  Mehmet was aware that we secured the door at the
extreme rear of the premises with two padbolts, and that we closed
and secured
the door from the rear store room with two padbolts, and also the door from the
office arear to the Dubbing Studio with
four padbolts.
<P>

It was ten or fifteen minutes after Sadullah and myself had left the premises,
that Mehmet Atmali and Fazli Yilmaz joined us in
the coffee lounge.  Mehmet
handed back to me, the keys to the shop and the burglar alarm, and told me that
he had locked up in the
normal way, and set the burglar alarm.
<P>

The four of us, left the coffee shop together, about 11pm, and walked together
into Queen Street, near our shop.  Sadullah Vatansever
then left in his car,
which was parked in Queen Street.  Mehmet and Fazli left in their cars.  My car
was parked directly outside
the front of our shop.  I firstly walked up to the
front of the shop and checked the two front door and checked that they were
locked,
then I drove home in my car.  I arrived home about 11.15pm.
<P>

101	Mr Kavurma conceded that the second version was not accurate and went on to
say that it was mistaken.  These questions and answers
followed -
<P>

Q.  What the interpreter has read to you is what you told Mr Thomas isn't
it?
<P>

A.  Not a portion of it.
<P>

Q.  You told Mr Thomas that you left the shop at about 10.30 leaving another
person to lock up and put on the burglar alarm?
<P>

A.  What I said was that we locked the place and all of us have left.
<P>

102	I accept the accuracy of Mr Thomas' record.  Mr Kavurma's attempt to deny
its accuracy demonstrated his lack of candour.  It
seems quite possible, though
I can make no positive finding, that by the time he realised the insurance
company wanted to ask questions
about the circumstances of the night, he saw
the need to distance himself from events the insurer might have regarded as
significant,
such as the locking up of the shop and the setting of the
alarm.
<P>

103	The evidence was silent as to any relations between Mr Kavurma and Mr
Atmali after their new business closed in about 1991 or
1992, but there was no
evidence that they had fallen out.  They are men who know each other well and
have been in business together
for a significant time.  No reason was given why
Mr Atmali could not give evidence, yet he did not.  I infer that if he had been
called to give evidence, his evidence would not have assisted the plaintiff's
case.  He could have given evidence about his understanding
of English and
whether he translated for Mr Kavurma during the interviews with Mr Thomas.
<P>

104	More importantly, he could have given evidence whether he and Mr Kavurma
had approached Mrs Yuksel and asked her to lend them
$4,000.  He could have
said whether he had asked Mrs Yuksel for her garage key and whether he had
stored anything in her garage.
 I would have expected the plaintiff to call him
to give this evidence and its failure to do so makes me infer that his evidence
would not have assisted the plaintiff's case.  The only evidence about these
matters to put against that of Mrs and Miss Yuksel is
that of Mr Kavurma, and I
am not confident about accepting his evidence at face value in view of his lack
of candour.
<P>

105	The defendant relied on evidence of a substantial increase in the sum
insured on the contents of the plaintiff's business shortly
before the fire.
The contents of the premises were insured for $200,000 and the policy commenced
on 24 November 1988.  Mr Kavurma's
evidence was that he spoke to the insurance
agent, Mr Fuggle, and asked him to arrange the insurance.  When the policy
arrived, two
or three weeks later, he noticed that the sum insured was only
$200,000, so he called Mr Fuggle and asked him why he had insured
the contents
for only $200,000.  Mr Fuggle told him that he would put the matter right.
They did not speak about the matter further.
 The sum insured was not
increased.
<P>

106	A series of handwritten memoranda was tendered, originating from the office
of the insurance broker, Richard Oliver Australia
Pty Limited, and addressed to
the defendant.  The first, dated 25 July 1989, required building cover to be
added to the policy in
the sum of $300,000.  The memorandum stated that the
policy should be in the name of Hassan Atmali trading as Turkmen Video.
<P>

107	Two days later another memorandum was written stating that no building
insurance was required, only an increase in the sum insured
on contents to
$300,000.  The defendant issued an endorsement to the policy accordingly.
<P>

108	On 3 August 1989 yet another memorandum was written stating that the
requested name change was incorrect and that the policy
should be in the name
of the plaintiff as it had been originally.
<P>

109	On 27 July 1989 Richard Oliver Australia Pty Limited wrote a letter to Mr
Atmali (whom it called Atmati) at a post office box
address in Pennant Hills,
referring to conversations with Mr Fuggle and advising that the contents cover
had been increased to $300,000.
 None of the documents is addressed to or
refers to Mr Kavurma.
<P>

110	I have difficulty in accepting that he asked Mr Fuggle to increase the sum
insured to $300,000 in 1988.  The reference in the
documents to Mr Atmali
suggests that he was the one who made the arrangements, and not until July
1989.  In view of Mr Kavurma's
proprietorship of the business and his concern
about the sum insured, I think that he probably knew what was happening.  I
think
that he had decided by then to have the business set on fire.
<P>

111	On 20 July 1989 Mr Kavurma and Mr Atmali wrote a letter to the secretary of
the Auburn United Friendly Society saying that they
were interested in buying
the building.  The owners indicated that they were prepared to sell for a price
which they named, and Mr
Kavurma did not remember exactly what it had been, but
it exceeded $500,000.  He and Mr Atmali met the bank manager to discuss the
latter, but the purchase never went ahead.  Precisely why was not explained.
If Mr Kavurma and Mr Atmali were going to buy the building
they would have had
to borrow the money from the bank.  It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff
that this was further proof that
Mr Kavurma was interested in fostering the
business, not damaging it.
<P>

112	I do not accept this submission.  The fact is that the plaintiff did not
buy the building and had no particular interest in
its preservation.  It was
not submitted that the inquiry gave rise to any inference that money was
available other than such as could
have been borrowed from the bank.  Mr
Kavurma had conducted a number of businesses in various buildings in the Auburn
district and,
as subsequent events proved, could move again at short notice.
<P>

113	There are several other pieces of evidence which may possibly have a
bearing on the question whether Mr Kavurma was in some
way involved in setting
fire to the business.  There was evidence of grudges borne in the wholesale and
retail video tape industry.
 Mr Kavurma had been involved in a number of court
cases in which action had to be taken against others to protect copyright and
distribution rights.  Those actions took place in this Court and in the Supreme
Court of Victoria.  There were many parties to them
and I assume that, whatever
the ultimate prize, the costs to the participants must have been heavy.
<P>

114	About one week before the fire a motor vehicle owned by Mr Kavurma's wife
and used by Mr Kavurma was parked at Mr Atmali's premises
and an unknown person
set fire to it by pouring petrol on the roof and igniting it.
<P>

115	At the time of the fire Mr Kavurma was involved in a dispute with his
former girlfriend over the ownership of a house at Auburn
that he had purchased
in her name in 1976.  He had commenced court proceedings against her and
relations between them were bitter.
<P>

116	The plaintiff pointed to these several pieces of evidence to demonstrate
that third persons had reason to dislike him and a
motive to injure him by
damaging his property.  Any such person might have been responsible for setting
fire to the business.
<P>

117	It was submitted that the jemmy marks on the back door of the premises,
which was nailed shut, showed that the attack on the
premises must have been
made by somebody unfamiliar with them, which was unlikely if Mr Kavurma was
involved.  Assuming that the
jemmy marks were fresh, about which the evidence
is unclear, they may well have been made by the drug addict Mr Kavurma told
Miss
Yuksel he had organised to light the fire.  Such a casual labourer would
probably be unfamiliar with the premises.
<P>

118	These circumstances point to possibilities other than the one contended for
by the defendant but they do not show that Mr Kavurma
could not have been
knowlingly concerned in the fire.  They are not enough to displace the evidence
of Mrs and Miss Yuksel, whose
accounts I accept.
<P>

119	I am satisfied to the required degree of proof that Mr Kavurma knew and
intended that the premises should be set on fire.  The
plaintiff's claim
against the defendant was fraudulent.  There will be a verdict for the
defendant.  The plaintiff must pay the defendant's
costs in an amount to be
agreed or assessed.
