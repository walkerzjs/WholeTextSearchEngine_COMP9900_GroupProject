<b>JUDGMENT (Imputations - capacity - form)</b>
<P>

1	By an Amended Statement of Claim the plaintiff sues the first and second
defendants in respect of a publication on 26 August 1998
in the following
terms:
<P>

	<i>"Schedule A</i>
<P>

	<i>The Board of directors of Coms21 Limited has decided to stand down its
General Manager, Mr Mal Weston, pending receipt of an explanation
from him as
to where he's been, what company business he has been on and what authority he
has had to do it.</i>
<P>

	<i>The decision was taken because Mr Weston has been absent from his duties
for much of the time since Mr Graeme Green of Felscot Pty
Limited announced his
intention to launch a takeover for Coms21".</i>
<P>

2	The plaintiff contends that this matter complained of in its natural and
ordinary meaning conveys the following defamatory imputation
of him:
<P>

	<i>"6(a)	the plaintiff deceitfully absented himself from his duties as General
Manager of the company in order to give clandestine assistance,
on the
Company's time, to persons who were seeking to take over control of the Company
contrary to the best interests of the Company;</i>
<P>

	<i>(b)	the plaintiff was derelict in his duties as General Manager of the
Company in that he had, without the knowledge or authority
of the Company,
absented himself from his duties at a time when the Company was the subject of
a takeover bid".</i>
<P>

3	The plaintiff sues the third defendant as the publisher of "<i>The Australian
Financial Review</i>" in respect of a matter published on 27 August 1998 as
follows:
<P>

	"<i>Schedule B</i>
<P>

	<i>The boardroom tussle at smartcard and gaming group Coms21 Limited escalated
yesterday when the largest shareholder called for the
removal of all directors
except founder and chief executive Mr Graeme Green.</i>
<P>

	<i>Felscot Pty Limited, a company owned by Mr Green and his brother James, is
believed to have requested a shareholders meeting to consider
the removal of
executive chairman Mr Frank Favretto, acting chief executive Mr Rodger
Mortleman, Mr Keith Cullen and Mr Mike Hale.</i>
<P>

	<i>The Australian Financial understands that Felscot has nominated Mr Jim
Green, Coms21 general manager Mr Mal Weston and Sydney businessman
Mr Roger
Brewitt as directors.  Felscot owns a 14.68 per cent stake in Coms21.</i>
<P>

	<i>The move follows the decision by Coms21's board to temporarily stand down
Mr Weston on Tuesday, just days after taking the same action
against Mr Graeme
Green.</i>
<P>

	<i>The boardroom has been split since mid-August when the board advised
shareholders to ignore a $71 million cash bid by Felscot and
instead accepted a
rival scrip offer by Florida-based Atlantic International Entertainment.</i>
<P>

	<i>The AFR revealed last week that Coms21's board had temporarily stood down
Mr Green until his bid for gaming and smartcard group is
concluded.</i>
<P>

	<i>Earlier yesterday, Mr Favretto confirmed the board had decided to stand Mr
Weston down `pending receipt of an explanation from him
as to where he's been,
what company business he has been on and what authority he has had to do
it'.</i>
<P>

	<i>He said the decision was taken because Mr Weston had been absent from his
duties for much of the time since Mr Green announced his
intention to launch a
takeover for Coms21.</i>
<P>

	<i>Felscot yesterday said Mr Weston had been concluding his own investigation
into the Atlantic bid and had concerns about the board's
due-diligence
progress, the information provided in Atlantic's Part A statement, and the
Coms21 Part B response.</i>
<P>

	<i>It is understood Mr Weston met with the Australian Securities and
Investment Commission yesterday and handed over some documents".</i>
<P>

4	This second matter complained of, it is contended, in its natural and
ordinary meaning conveys the following defamatory imputations
of the
plaintiff:
<P>

	<i>"10(a)	the plaintiff had deceitfully absented himself from his duties as
General Manager of the Company in order to give clandestine
assistance, on the
Company's time, to persons who were seeking to take over control of the Company
contrary to the best interests
of the Company;</i>
<P>

	<i>(b)	the plaintiff was derelict in his duties as General Manager of the
Company in that he had, without the knowledge or authority
of the Company,
absented himself from his duties at a time when the Company was the subject of
a takeover bid".</i>
<P>

5	It is also pleaded that the imputations set out above in respect of each
matter complained of arise by reason of a reader knowing
the following fact,
namely that a person holding the position of General Manager of a public
company owes legal and ethical duties
to the company to act in good faith
towards the company and in the best interests of the company (paragraph 11 of
ASC).
<P>

6	Pursuant to SCR Pt 31 r 2 and by consent the defendants have applied for
rulings in relation to the capacity of each matter complained
of to carry the
pleaded imputations.
<P>

7	It was agreed that no impediment to the determination of the issues on the
application arises from the pleading of the extrinsic
fact said to found the
imputations as true innuendos.
<P>

8	I am of the view that imputations 6(b) and 10(b) easily can be disposed of,
as each contains the same flaw.  The imputation, in
each case, refers to the
plaintiff being absent "<i>without the knowledge</i>" of the company.  Each
matter complained of cannot reasonably give rise to any suggestion that the
plaintiff's absence was "<i>without the knowledge</i>" of the company.  Indeed,
in each case it is made perfectly clear that the plaintiff's absence was known
to the company.  
<P>

9	Imputations 6(b) and 10(b) will not go to the jury;  the plaintiff will have
leave to amend.
<P>

10	Imputations 6(a) and 10(a) are very problematical.  First, there is the
ambiguity acknowledged to arise from the application
of the phrase "<i>contrary
to the best interests of the company</i>" either to the absence of the
plaintiff or to the takeover.  Accepting, for the moment, the resolution of the
ambiguity by applying
the phrase to the takeover (as Mr Gray indicated was the
intention), the real problem arises from the use of the words
"<i>deceitfully"</i> and "<i>clandestine</i>".
<P>

11	With respect to the first matter complained of Mr Lancaster argued that
there is nothing in it to support the pejorative connotation
of deceit.  It
seems to me that what the first matter complained of is really speaking about
at the very least, is coincidence. 
The plaintiff was known to have been absent
from the time the takeover offer was made.  What was not known was what the
plaintiff
was doing in terms of company business and whether he had any
authority therefor, and where he had been.  In respect to this first
matter
complained of I am persuaded that there is nothing in that matter complained of
that would give rise to the notion of deceit
relied upon by the plaintiff
(based upon the Macquarie dictionary), namely, "<i>concealment of the truth for
the purpose of misleading".</i>  I am not persuaded that the brief piece sued
upon is capable of giving rise to a legitimate course of inference drawing as
opposed
to suspicious speculation.  In any event, I am further unpersuaded that
the use of the word "<i>deceitfully</i>" adds anything, either with respect to
motive or method, to the use of the word "<i>clandestine".  </i>Imputation 6(a)
is embarrassing in form and will be struck out.
<P>

12	As to the second matter complained of, in the end, the same considerations
apply.  "<i>Deceitfully"</i> and the meaning relied upon adds nothing, in my
view, to the use of the word "<i>clandestine</i>" which, according to the
Macquarie Dictionary, involves itself a notion of deception.  
<P>

13	The second matter complained of is however, by reason of its greater length,
capable of giving rise to disparagement of the plaintiff
in the area sought to
be encompassed by imputation 10(a).  What is made clear in <i>The Financial
Review</i> piece is the connection between the plaintiff and the company
launching the takeover in the context of a Board split in the target
company.
This is clear particularly from the third paragraph.  If there is any
"<i>deception</i>" at all it cannot be in relation to Mr Weston's absence:
that was open, known and subject to inquiry.  What this matter complained
of
arguably is capable of pointing to is something more than the mere coincidence
suggested in the first matter complained of by
reason of the link between the
plaintiff and the hostile forces.  Shortly stated, the plaintiff was absent,
his absence was known
to the company of which he was General Manager, the
reasons for his absence and the nature of any of that company's business to
which
he had been attending and under what authority were not known and, it
turns out, he has been nominated by the <i>"opposition</i>" to be a Member of
the Board of the target company.
<P>

14	Imputation 10(a) will be struck out as bad in form with leave to amend.  
<P>

15	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	Imputations 6(a) and 10(a) are struck out.
<P>

2.	Imputations 6(b) and 10(b) will not go to the jury.
<P>

3.	The plaintiff has leave to file an Amended Statement of Claim within 14
days.
<P>

4.	Within 14 days of the filing of an Amended Statement of Claim the parties
have leave to file, by consent, orders and directions
for the further conduct
of the matter in the Defamation List.  
<P>

5.	Otherwise, at the expiry of 28 days the parties have liberty to restore the
matter to the Defamation List on 3 days notice.
<P>

6.	The plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs.
