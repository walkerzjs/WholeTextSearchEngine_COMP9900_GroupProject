<b>4118/97 - JUDITH OLGA JOYE &amp; 1 OR v REHUXO PTY LIMITED &amp; 7
ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (EX TEMPORE)</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  This judgment is directed to the costs of an
application filed on 24 December 1998 seeking an order for security
for costs,
and subsequently withdrawn. The application was in proceedings brought by
Judith and Chistopher Joye as plaintiffs against,
inter alios, David and Susan
Bradley as defendants.  By a cross-claim filed on 26 November 1997, the
Bradleys sought relief against
the plaintiffs and also Ian Edward Joye and
Robert Eric Horsell. I shall refer to the plaintiffs and Ian Edward Joye as
`the Joyes'.
 The applicants on the Notice of Motion for security for costs
were the Joyes and Mr Horsell, and the respondents were the Bradleys.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

2  	The plaintiffs are wife and son respectively of Ian Joye.  At all
relevant times Ian Joye was an accountant and company promoter.
 Mr Horsell was
employed as an accountant and company secretary of various companies controlled
by Ian Joye. Susan Bradley is Ian
Joye's sister and David Bradley is her
husband.
<P>

3  	The dispute in the proceedings relates to a trust called `the
Susan Trust'.  The plaintiffs allege that the trust was established
by Mr
Horsell on the instructions of Ian Joye in 1983 for the benefit of the
plaintiffs.  The Bradleys allege in their cross-claim
that it was established
in 1977 for the benefit of Susan Bradley and her children.  It appears that
there is no document such as
a trust deed evidencing its terms.
<P>

4  	Since 1983 the trustee of the Susan Trust has been the first
defendant, Rehuxo Pty Limited.  From 1983 to 1987 the Bradleys
were the only
directors and shareholders of the Rehuxo, and Horsell was the company secretary
from 1983 until March 1993.  It is
asserted by the Joyes that the Bradleys were
not intended to have any role in relation to Rehuxo other than to act in
accordance
with the directors of Ian Joye.
<P>

5  	The Joyes assert that Ian Joye obtained from the Bradleys signed
transfers in blank of their shares in Rehuxo and also signed
letters of
resignation of their directorships, and that these documents were kept by Mr
Horsell on Ian Joye's behalf to ensure that
the Bradleys complied with his
directions.
<P>

6  	The Bradleys deny that the documents were furnished for this
specific purpose, and they assert in their cross-claim that the
documents were
provided solely to enable Joye to undertake on their behalf, from time to time,
dealings in company shares other than
Rehuxo.  They claim that Ian Joye  acted
as their financial adviser and occupied a fiduciary position and that his
attempted use
of the documents to remove them from the control of Rehuxo was a
breach of his fiduciary duty.
<P>

7  	In 1997, by which time it was clear that the parties were in
dispute, Ian Joye arranged for the transfers to be completed by
the insertion
of the names of the plaintiffs as transferees, and forwarded the transfers to
Rehuxo for registration.  Registration
was refused.  Accordingly, the plaintiff
instituted proceedings for orders that the documents be registered, and for
declarations
that resolutions passed for the appointment of new directors were
valid and assets held by Rehuxo were held on trust for the plaintiffs.
 
<P>

8  	The plaintiffs also allege that during their period of
directorship the Bradleys breached their fiduciary duty by using funds
held by
Rehuxo for their own benefit.
<P>

9  	The Bradleys deny the alleged breaches and in their cross-claim
they assert that the Susan Trust was established for the benefit
of Susan
Bradley and her children and they are entitled to remain as directors and
shareholders of Rehuxo. They allege that Ian Joye
and Mr Horsell have dealt
improperly with the assets of the trust since 1983, without their knowledge and
consent. In particular
they claim that shares in other companies held in trust
by Rehuxo have been transferred by using transfer documents irregularly
executed
by Mr Horsell at the direction of Ian Joye without the authority of
Rehuxo.  They say that Ian Joye sought to use a portion of the
trust assets for
the purpose of a settlement with his wife, Judith, when their marriage broke up
in May 1994.
<P>

10  	There are also contentions, which are unnecessary for me to
explore for the purposes of the present judgment, that a nominee
company of
County Natwest Securities Australia Ltd held assets on behalf of Mr Joye in
trust for Rehuxo and the Susan Trust and that
those assets where improperly
dealt with.
<P>

11  	This brief account of the facts, sufficient for present
purposes, shows that the case involves some complex contested matters
of fact
and potentially some difficult questions of law.  My account of the factual
allegations is taken from the pleadings and from
a judgment delivered by Foster
AJ on 3 August 1999 (<i>Joye v Rehuxo Pty Limited</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/785.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 785).</a>  I
mention that because as it happened, no evidence was adduced on the application
for security for costs so I have no evidentiary
basis for making any finding of
fact at all for the purposes of this judgment.
<P>

12  	Since the filing of the cross-claim by the Bradleys on 26
November 1997 there have been numerous interlocutory steps which
have been
usefully summarised for me in submissions. Suffice it to say that there have
been hotly contested interlocutory proceedings
with respect to such matters as
Notices to Produce and subpoenas.
<P>

<b>The application for security for costs</b>
<P>

13  	The application for security for costs was filed, as I have
mentioned, on 24 December 1998 and it came before me for hearing
on 13 August
1999.  At the hearing counsel for the Joyes as applicants contended that an
order for security for costs would be appropriate
in order to assist his
clients to deal with some of the risks and burdens of litigation.  He  said
that litigation involves loss
of time, stress, irrecoverable costs even if the
litigant is thoroughly successful, and a credit risk for recovery of the
proceeds
of litigation in the event of success.  Some of the risks and burdens
of litigation are unavoidable and arise even in cases where
there is a real
dispute between the parties, and the Court can do very little to avoid them
otherwise than to conduct its business
efficiently.  But here, he said, the
Court can assist with the credit risk for recovery.  He submitted that
experience teaches us
that litigants who run cases in which they do not believe
are typically driven by financial need.  Therefore, when the facts before
the
Court in an interlocutory application indicate that a litigant is proceeding
with a case which is shadowy and lacks substance,
and is acting vexatiously in
a way in which could constitute an abuse of process, the Court should infer
from that conduct that the
other party to the litigation has a credit risk for
recovery and should make appropriate application for orders.
<P>

14  	As to the legal basis for such orders, the Joyes submitted
that:
<P>

(a)	the Court has an inherent jurisdiction, confirmed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme
Court Act 1970</a> (NSW), to regulate its own practice and procedure, and the
judgment of Holland J in<b> </b><i>Rajski v Computer Manufacture and Design Pty
Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%202%20NSWLR%20443" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 2 NSWLR 443</a> especially at 447-8 demonstrates the breadth of
the Court's inherent power;
<P>

(b)	the Court's discretion to give security is `unlimited and unrestricted':<b>
</b><i>Southern Cross Exploration v Fire and All Risks Insurance Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%201%20NSWLR%20114" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985)
1 NSWLR 114</a> at 122C;
<P>

(c)	the Court may take into account that the plaintiff or cross-claimant has
conducted the proceedings in a vexatious way or in
a manner amounting to an
abuse of process (<i>Weger v Boola Boola Petroleum and Natural Gas Co NL</i>
[1923] VLR 570), and that the plaintiffs/cross-claimants have not shown that
they are without resources or that the litigation would
be stultified by the
provision of security (<i>Shackles v BHP Ltd</i><b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1996/76.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] VicRp 76</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%202%20VR%20427" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 2 VR 427)</a>;
<P>

(d)	there is an analogy between the order sought by the applicants in this case
and orders made in United States District Courts
pursuant to rules adopted by
them, such as in <i>Miller v Suffield</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USCA6/1957/173.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1957] USCA6 173</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=249%20F%202d%2017" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">249 F 2d 17</a> (1957), a case which
implies that it is appropriate to give security against a litigant who makes
vague charges which lack substance
and substantiation;
<P>

(e)	there is also an analogy with the English Supreme Court Rules Order 14, r
4(3), which permits the Court to grant leave to a
defendant, against whom an
application for summary judgment has been made, to defend the action on such
terms as to giving security
as the Court thinks fit.
<P>

15  	The English practice should be noted more fully<i>. Lloyd's
Banking Company v Ogle</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281876%29%201%20Ex%20D%20262" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1876) 1 Ex D 262</a> indicates that the Court may make
orders for security for costs against a defendant where there is something
suspicious in the defendant's
mode of presenting his case, such that the Court
is left with a real doubt about the defendant's good faith.  In <i>Fieldrank
Ltd v E Stein</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1961%5d%201%20WLR%201287" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1961] 1 WLR 1287</a>, 1289 Devlin LJ said:
<P>

`I think that any judge who has sat in chambers to hear  summonses under Order
14 has had the experience of a case in which, although
he cannot say for
certain that there is not a triable issue, he is nevertheless left with a real
doubt about the defendant's good
faith, and would like to protect the
plaintiff, especially if there is no real hardship on the defendant being made
to pay money
into Court.'
<P>

16  	In other cases reference is made to defences which are `shadowy'
or lacking in substance:<b> </b><i>Van Lynn Developments Ltd v Pelias
Construction Co</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%201%20QB%20607" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] 1 QB 607</a>, 614;<b> </b><i>Ionian Bank v Couvreur</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%201%20WLR%20781" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] 1 WLR 781</a>, 787.
<P>

17  	The Joyes said that in the present case these principles should
be applied, in the exercise of the Court's inherent jurisdiction
and without
the authority of any specific rule of Court, having regard to the following
matters:
<P>

(a)	multiple admissions by the Bradleys against interest, never denied by them,
and made in letters and diary entries created in
1985 and 1986 and in
conversations in 1986 and 1987;
<P>

(b)	the Bradleys signed resignations as directors and secretary of Rehuxo and
then gave evidence to explain those documents in a
manner which was
contradictory;
<P>

(c)	the parties had come close to implementing arrangements for the removal of
the Bradleys as directors and shareholders of Rehuxo
and for putting the assets
of the Susan Trust under the control of the plaintiffs, but those arrangements
were not completed;
<P>

(d)	the Susan Trust acquired by far the majority of its assets through or from
Ian Joye or entities with which he was associated,
and so the Bradleys are
volunteers seeking to obtain a windfall gain;
<P>

(e)	the conduct of the Bradleys during the proceedings, which forced the Joyes
to expend time, cost and effort to obtain the documents
from the Bradleys,
including the original directors' resignations and share transfers; the
Bradleys made serious allegations by their
counsel about matters not raised in
the pleadings; and the Bradleys have removed substantial money from the Susan
Trust since 1995;

<P>

(f)	a serious issue of credit relating to the Bradleys' evidence that they were
unaware that assets had been placed in the Susan
Trust by Ian Joye;
<P>

(g)	the lack of evidence that the Bradleys would suffer disadvantage or that
the litigation would be stultified by the provision
of security in the amount
claimed.
<P>

18  	The Bradleys submitted that the Joyes have ignored a fundamental
principle with respect to orders for security costs.  They
said that security
for costs is justified by the principle that a respondent to a claim who has
been forced to expend costs in defence
should not face the risk of being unable
to recover the costs if the claim is ultimately unsuccessful.  The purpose of
an order for
security for costs is not to stifle or suppress a claim on the
basis that it might appear weak (though that was not conceded in the
present
case).
<P>

19  	While admitting that the Court has a relevant inherent power,
acknowledged in the<b> </b><i>Rajski</i> case, the Bradleys submitted that the
inherent power must be exercised in accordance with established principles, and
that it would
be a remarkable step for the Court to order security for costs
against a natural person in circumstances where there is no suggestion
of
impecuniosity.  Further, the Bradleys submitted that where it is contended that
a party has a weak case, the appropriate procedure
is to seek an order for stay
or dismissal of the proceeding under Pt 13 r 5, and no such application has
been made in the present
case.
<P>

20  	The Bradleys contended that the authorities relied on by the
Joyes, upon proper examination, could be seen to be cases where
there was some
special reason for ordering security for costs beyond a suspicion of abuse of
process, vexatious conduct or a shadowy
claim.  As regards the English practice
under Order 14 r 4 the Bradleys pointed out that the order for security is not
an order for
security for costs under that rule but is an order to secure the
plaintiff in respect of the judgment amount.
<P>

21  	As regards the discretionary factors relied upon by the Joyes in
the present case the Bradleys submitted that, to a large degree,
those matters
relate to the alleged weaknesses of the Bradleys' case and it would not be
possible to assess the relative strengths
or weaknesses of the parties' cases
in an interlocutory application by reference to selected parts of evidence
which, in due course,
will be extremely voluminous.  Further, the Bradleys said
there are also inconsistencies and admissions in the Joyes' case and they
attached a substantial schedule to their written submission setting out their
claims in that regard.  Although the Bradleys admitted
that the chance of
success may be a relevant factor in the context of an application for security
against an insolvent corporate
plaintiff, even in such a case the chance of
success is given little weight as a factor: <i>Equity Access Limited v Westpac
Banking Corporation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20ATPR%2040%2d972" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] ATPR 40-972</a>, 50-636.  The Bradleys submitted
that they are, contrary to the Joyes submission, conducting the litigation
properly, and that the
Joyes' allegations against them were not a complete
account of the matters referred to.  The Bradleys' written submission relied
on
substantial details to support this point.
<P>

22  	The Bradleys submitted that there were additional discretionary
matters which should weigh against an order for security for
costs against
them.  They submitted that their cross-claim was, in substance, merely a
defence to the plaintiffs' action, and that
security for costs will not be
ordered against a cross-claimant in such circumstances: <i>Willey v Synan</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1935/76.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1935] HCA 76</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281935%29%2054%20CLR%20175" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1935) 54 CLR 175</a>;<b> </b><i>Re Travel Lodge Australia Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%2021%20ACTR%2017" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 21 ACTR
17.</a>
<P>

23  	Further, the Bradleys drew attention to the delay of 13 months
between the filing of the cross-claim and the filing of the
application for
security for costs, pointing out that during that period a large number of
steps have been taken in the proceedings.
 In their contention an application
for security for costs should be made promptly (<i>Buckley v Canal Design &amp;
Constructions Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%201%20ACLR%20301" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) 1 ACLR 301</a>, 309) and the Court is entitled
to have regard to the length of the delay, and the reason for delay, in making
its decision (<i>Southern Cross Exploration</i>).
<P>

<b>Hearing of Application for Security</b>
<P>

24  	The Joyes' application for security for costs was heard by me on
13 August 1999.  After opening, counsel for the Joyes sought
to read the
affidavit of Malcolm Stewart of 2 August 1999, to which there is a 159 page
exhibit.  Counsel for the Bradleys objected
to the admissibility of substantial
portions of the exhibit, largely though not exclusively on the ground that
specified documents
in the exhibit were amenable to a claim of `without
prejudice privilege' under s 131 of the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (NSW).
<P>

25  	Further, counsel for the Bradleys submitted that if certain copy
affidavits contained in the exhibit were to be admitted, their
deponents should
be available to give oral evidence and to be subjected to cross-examination
even though the application was interlocutory.
 
<P>

26  	There followed a protracted contest as to the admissibility of
the exhibit, in which counsel for the Joyes contended that a
condition of the
claim to privilege under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s131.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 131</a> is that the parties be in dispute, and in the
present case the parties were not in dispute at the time when many of the
disputed
documents were created.  Further, counsel submitted that in respect of
many of the disputed documents the Bradleys had waived any
claim to
privilege.
<P>

27  	Counsel for the Bradleys responded that if the evidence on which
the Joyes wished to rely were to be admitted, the Bradleys
would wish to put on
evidence in reply relating to such matters as alleged admissions and waiver,
and consequently the application
for security for costs would become a
mini-trial.  For that reason alone, counsel submitted, the Court should reject
the disputed
evidence in the exercise of its discretion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 135.</a>
<P>

28  	In light of the complexity of the submissions on admissibility,
I decided that the best course would be to direct the parties
to make written
submissions with respect to that question and to stand the matter over for
further consideration after the submissions
had been prepared and
considered.
<P>

29  	The written submissions on admissibility filled out the oral
contentions which had been made at the hearing on 13 August 1999.
 It is
noteworthy that the Bradleys reiterated in their submission that if affidavit
evidence were to be admitted, it must be on
the basis that the deponents be
available to give oral evidence and be cross-examined.  Their written
submission said (paragraph
26):
<P>

`The Joye parties' contentions are to the effect that in the Bradleys' case
there exist such inconsistencies and serious admissions
against interest that
security for costs ought to be awarded despite the fact that the application is
against natural persons and
despite the fact that there is no suggestion of any
inability to meet an award of costs.  The Joyes' contentions are very serious.
The Joyes' contention is that the Bradleys have no belief in their case, as
evidenced by the &#180;admissions' (as submitted by counsel
for the Joyes on 13
August).  In these circumstances the Bradleys  are entitled to have these
allegations proven strictly, including
a right to cross-examine.'
<P>

30  	On 1 September 1999, the day before the matter was due to return
to me for further directions, the solicitors for the Joyes
wrote to my
Associate saying that their clients wish to withdraw the Notice of Motion and
would consent to an order that it be dismissed.
 The letter said:
<P>

`In light of the objections taken by the respondents on 13 August 1999 on the
ground of without prejudice privilege, and in light
of the written submissions
for the respondents received on 31 August 1999 it appears that to canvass the
issues relating to admissibility
of evidence on the limited evidence which we
would be able to tender on this application may have the effect of prejudicing
our clients'
position as to admissibility at the trial, when a great deal
evidence will be tendered and tested.  As our counsel recognised on
13 August
1999, the present motion should not develop into a mini-trial which could last
at least several further days of hearing
time.'
<P>

31  	Thus, the application for security for costs has not proceeded,
and as it has transpired no evidence at all has been admitted
on the
application.  But there remains the question of costs of the application.  The
Joyes contend that there should be no order
as to costs, and the Bradleys seek
an order for indemnity costs to be assessed and payable forthwith.
<P>

<b>The Question of Costs</b>
<P>

32  	The Joyes say that in light of the objection taken as to without
prejudice privilege on 13 August 1999, there was little utility
in proceeding
with the application, on a cost-benefit analysis, because the question of
admissibility would have turned the application
into a three or four day
mini-trial.  Further, to have canvassed the issues raised in written
submissions with very limited evidence
may have prejudiced the Joyes'
contentions as to admissibility at the trial. That was the reason for
withdrawing the application
and in those circumstances, the Joyes submit, there
should be no order as to costs.
<P>

33  	Further, they say that the present stance of the Bradleys as to
without prejudice privilege is inconsistent with the stance
previously taken by
them and, accordingly, their present stance was not reasonably foreseeable when
the plaintiffs filed their Notice
of Motion for security.  In paragraph 3 of
their written submission they say the inconsistency arises in two ways.  First,
senior
counsel for the Bradleys submitted on 8 December 1998 that a letter
written by Mr Horsell on 10 April 1996 had been written `before
the dispute had
crystallised';  consequently at that stage, counsel for the Bradleys adhered to
the view that there was no dispute
for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s131.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 131.</a>  Secondly, the
Joyes say that no without prejudice objection was taken to the plaintiffs
tendering two of the admissions on 20 May
1999, namely, the Susan Bradley diary
of 22 January 1996 and a letter by David Bradley of early 1996.
<P>

34  	I agree with the Joyes' submission that it was sensible and
desirable to avoid prolonging the application in such a way that
it would have
become a mini-trial.  It seems to me  that the assessment by the legal advisers
to the Joyes on 1 September 1999 that
it was likely, if the application
continued, that a mini-trial would eventuate was correct. Specifically, it is
likely that I would
have found it necessary to allow cross-examination of the
witnesses whose affidavits were contained in the exhibit, in view of the
strong
submission by the Bradleys which I have set out above.  It is also quite
possible that I would have permitted further evidence
to be filed by the
Bradleys, particularly with respect to such matters as admissions and
waiver.
<P>

35  	Given the history of the matter, which demonstrates that every
issue is closely contested, the estimate of the Joyes of a three
or four day
mini-trial was probably an underestimate, even though I would have endeavoured
to limit the oral evidence adduced on
an interlocutory application.
<P>

36  	The central problem, however, was not the objection taken as to
without prejudice privilege.  The central problem was that
the application for
security for costs relied upon some assertions which were bound to be factually
controversial, such as the assertion
that the Bradleys were conducting the
litigation vexatiously and that the conduct amounted to an abuse of process.
In order to make
good those assertions, it would have been necessary for the
Joyes to enter into the proof of issues which would be closely related
to, or
identical with, some of the central issues likely to arise at the final hearing
of the matter - such is the question whether
a dispute had arisen by 1996, the
extent of any implied waiver of privilege, and in particular the dispute as to
the circumstances
in which the forms of resignation and transfer of shares were
executed.
<P>

37  	In my view, the Joyes should have realised when formulating
their application for security for costs that a substantial factual
contest
would arise if the application was heard.  They should have realised, once they
decided to rely upon the exhibit to Mr Stewart's
affidavit, that counsel for
the Bradleys would seek to cross-examine the deponents of the affidavits
contained in the exhibit.  It
has not been suggested that the Bradleys were
acting inconsistently with some previous stance by demanding to cross-examine
some
deponents of affidavits.
<P>

38  	As to the contention that the present stance of the Bradleys as
to without prejudice privilege was inconsistent with the stance
previously
taken, this is a matter upon which I am unable to make any decision because of
the absence of any evidence in the application.
 But assuming, for the purpose
of determining the application for costs, that the contentions by the Joyes in
paragraph 3 of their
written submissions are true, my view is that the Joyes
should nevertheless have predicted that their application would need to be
supported by substantial evidence and would lead to a serious factual contest,
including a contest as to admissibility on some ground
or other and a demand
for cross-examination of witnesses.
<P>

39  	In these circumstances, though I accept that the Joyes  were
acting reasonably in deciding to withdraw the application on 1
September 1999,
my view is that the grounds for their doing so were, by and large, grounds of a
kind which they should have anticipated
before filing their application in
December 1998.  It therefore seems to me that their submission that there be no
order as to costs
of the application should fail.  The application having been
withdrawn in circumstances where the applicant will consent to an order
dismissing it, costs should follow the event.
<P>

<b>Indemnity costs</b>
<P>

40  	As to the Bradleys' claim for indemnity costs, their counsel
relied on<b> </b><i>Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Limited v The
International Produce Merchants Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2081%20ALR%20379" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 81 ALR 379</a> for the
proposition that indemnity costs are appropriate where an applicant, properly
advised, should have known that he had no chance
of success, and that in such a
case the action must be presumed to have been commenced or continued for some
ulterior motive, or
because of some wilful disregard of the known facts or
clearly established law. Relying on that proposition the Bradleys submit that
the application was hopeless from the outset, flying in the face of established
legal principle, and that the decision to withdraw
the application was based on
tactics and self-interest.
<P>

41  	I have set out the submissions of the parties on the application
for security in detail because it seems to me that a summary
of the submissions
demonstrates that there was a serious issue for the Court to determine.  It
must be the case that the Court has
an inherent jurisdiction with respect to
its own practice and procedure sufficiently broad to allow it to deal with a
recalcitrant
litigant beyond cases where summary judgment or summary dismissal
is appropriate.  Dealing with a recalcitrant litigant may involve
the
imposition of some terms upon that litigant and those terms may include an
order for security for costs.
<P>

42  	As far as counsel was able to discover, no Australian case has
yet made an order for security for costs in circumstances such
as in the
present case.  The authorities relied upon by the Joyes, cited above, can all
be explained on other bases than adherence
to a broad discretion to make an
order for security in circumstances such as the present.  But there are dicta
in those cases which
may have supported the kind of order which the Joyes
sought, if the application had been heard and the facts had supported the
claims
which the Joyes made.  I am not convinced that this Court would need a
rule of Court such as Order 14 r 4 of the English Supreme
Court Rules before
exercising its discretion to order security, if the facts had established
vexatious conduct tantamount to an abuse
of process and an assertion of a claim
without substance.
<P>

43  	It is unnecessary for me finally to resolve this point. For
present purposes it is enough for me to say that the Joyes' case
was, in my
view, an arguable one.  That being so, this is not a proper case for indemnity
costs.
<P>

<b>Immediate payment of costs</b>
<P>

44  	The Bradleys seek an order under Pt 52A r 9 of the Supreme Court
Rules that costs be assessed and paid forthwith.  They point
out that the
issues before the Court in the present application are quite distinct from the
issues before the Court in the primary
proceedings.  While that is so, there
are substantially overlapping questions of fact. They also say that unless the
Court makes
an order that costs be paid forthwith, it is likely that the
Bradleys may not recover their costs for a significant period, since
the
conclusion of the primary proceedings will not occur for some substantial time
(<i>Telstra Corporation Ltd v First Netcom Pty Limited,</i> Federal Court,
unreported, 7 May 1998, Einfield J). 
<P>

45  	Anyone who makes more than a cursory perusal of the already
massive Court file in this case would realise that if the proceedings
continue
to be contested as hotly as they have been to date and are fought to the bitter
end, the ultimate resolution will not occur
for a substantial time.  However, I
am not able to conclude that the length of the proceedings is a consequence of
the conduct of
one party rather than the other.  So far as I can see from the
submissions, the Bradleys are just as prone to contest every point
as are the
Joyes.  If the Joyes are successful at the hearing and an order for costs is
made in their favour, the amount of those
costs will be vastly in excess of the
costs of the present application, and whether there is strictly a set-off, the
outcome will
be that in that event the Bradleys will be required to pay a
substantial amount to the Joyes.  In those circumstances, I see no reason
for
making any order that costs be assessed and paid other than in the normal
course.
<P>
