<b>11869/98   -   NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LIMITED  v</b>
<P>

<b>			CAVILL PROTEAS PTY LIMITED &amp; 3 ORS</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Part 40 r 9(2) - Set aside default judgment)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed 20 April 1999 the
defendants seek leave to file a defence and cross claim, an order to set aside
judgment,
a stay of proceedings and that the venue be changed to Newcastle.
The plaintiff opposes the orders sought.  Default judgment was
entered on 29
September 1998 that the first defendant give the plaintiff possession of the
land described at Certificate of Title,
folio identifier 80/260606 and known as
Lot 80 Coolibah Drive Taree (the property) and that the defendants pay to the
plaintiff the
sum of $250,751.26.  A writ of possession issued on 29 September
1998.  On 4 February 1999 the property was sold for $190,000.
<P>

2  	The defendants relied on the affidavits of Mark Alfred Cavill
sworn on 19 April 1999, 14 May 1999 and 7 June 1999 and the plaintiff
relied on
the affidavits of John Phillip Previte sworn 14 September 1998 and two
affidavits of Peter Geoffrey Williams sworn 4 May
1999 and 20 May 1999.  Mark
Alfred Cavill was a director of the company and has been appointed by the
company to act for it.  He
was granted leave to appear on behalf of the company
and himself.  
<P>

3  	By mortgage dated 3 January 1990 the first defendant mortgaged
the property to the plaintiff.  The mortgage was registered on
1 February 1990.
By business combination loan as per letter of offer dated 5 February 1997 (the
First Loan Contract) the first defendant
agreed to pay to the plaintiff the sum
of $243,000 together with interest and all fees and other monies.  Subsequently
the plaintiff
advanced the sum of $243,000 to the first defendant.  The loan
was for a period of three years.  The first defendant neglected to
make payment
upon demand by the plaintiff.
<P>

4  	By fixed rate interest only loan as per letter of offer dated 5
February 1997 (the Second Loan Contract) the first defendant
agreed to pay
$150,000 together with interest and all fees and other monies owing to the
plaintiff.  The plaintiff advanced monies
of $150,000 referred to in the Second
Loan Contract to the first defendant on 7 July 1997.  The loan was at a fixed
interest rate
for a period of 12 months.  The first defendant subsequently
refused or neglected to make payment on the maturity date referred to
in the
Second Loan Contract on 7 May 1998.  The defendants do not dispute that these
loans were entered into and the company received
the monies nor do they deny
that they have defaulted in making loan repayments.
<P>

5 	The defendant submitted that in 1997 at the time when they entered into
the loans, had they been aware that they owed $50,000
less they could have gone
somewhere else and borrowed the funds.  They allege that the bank has made
mistakes and has fraudulently
concealed errors which amount to $50,000 to day.
The plaintiff submitted that the defendant has not adequately explained its
delay
in filing this application to set aside judgment nor has it a bona fide
defence and errors if any made prior to 1997 do not affect
the validity of the
1997 loans.  
<P>

<b><u>The Law</u></b>
<P>

6  	The relevant part of s 40 r 9(2) of the <b>Supreme Court
Rules</b> provides:
<P>

<b>"(2)	The Court may set aside or vary a judgment -</b>
<P>

<b>.....</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	where the judgment has been entered after judgment has been given in the
absence of a party, whether or not the absent party had
notice of trial or of
any motion for the judgment."</b>
<P>

7  	In determining whether default judgment should be set aside
Priestley JA in <b>Cohen v McWilliam</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2039%20NSWLR%20476" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 39 NSWLR 476</a> at 481 stated:
<P>

<b>"It is, however, another question whether concern about the extent of
delays, either in a particular case or generally, should, in
the absence of
prejudice in the particular case, be taken into account in exercising a
discretion to set aside default judgment.
 The fundamental duty of the court is
to do justice between the parties.  It is, in turn, fundamental to that duty
that the parties
should each be allowed a proper opportunity </b>
<P>

<b>to put their cases upon the merits of the matter.  Any limitation upon that
opportunity will generally be justified only on the necessity
to avoid
prejudice to the interests of some other party, occasioned by
misconduct."</b>
<P>

8  	For the defendant to succeed in its application to set aside
default judgment it must give an adequate explanation for the delay
in filing
its defence and show that it has a defence on its merits, or as often expressed
a bona fide defence.  However, as Priestley
JA said in <b><u>Cohen</u></b> it
is a fundamental duty of the court to do justice between the parties.
<P>

9  	Firstly I turn to the defendant's explanation for delay in filing
this application.  The defendants acknowledged that they received
the default
statement of claim on 10 August 1998.  They employed a solicitor to act on
their behalf and counsel's advice was sought.
 The defendants were advised that
it would be financially "suicidal" to litigate the matter in court and that
they should try and
settle it.  The defendants accepted the legal advice given
and decided that it was not in their interests to go to court.  On 7 September
1998 the defendants offered to mediate the dispute but the plaintiff declined
this offer.  
<P>

10  	On 21 August 1998 the defendants' solicitor filed a notice of
appearance.  On 25 August 1998 the defendants' solicitor advised
the
plaintiff's solicitor that a defence would be filed in the near future.
However a defence was never filed.  As previously stated,
on 29 September 1998
default judgment was entered.
<P>

11  	In November 1998 the defendants elected to defend the action.
On 27 November 1998 the first defendant wrote to the plaintiff's
solicitor and
informed it that they were in the process of filing a notice of motion for
leave to file a defence and cross claim.
 The directors of the first defendant
that is the second, third and fourth defendants reside in Taree.  They attended
the Supreme
Court registry in November 1998 and made the first attempt to draft
a notice of motion.  In December 1998 they received a number
of requisitions.
They attempted to answer the requisitions but that documentation did not reach
the court.  When the defendants telephoned
the registry in January 1999 they
ascertained that the documentation had not been received by the registry.  The
defendants promptly
posted further documentation in mid January 1999.  The
defendants obtained further requisitions on 4 February 1999.  
<P>

12  	Also in February 1999 the plaintiff sent the defendants
documentation in relation to a Farm Debt Mediation in relation to another
property (the farm).  While the defendants were involved in this dispute
resolving process in which they hoped to resolve this matter
they decided to
delay filing the notice of motion as they did not have the resources to focus
on both the mediation and Sydney court
appearances at the same time.  When the
mediation process was terminated on 19 March 1999 the defendants channelled
their efforts
towards answering the requisitions.  On 20 April 1999 the notice
of motion was ultimately filed.  It is my view that the delay of
eight months
has adequately been explained by the defendants.
<P>

13  	The first defendant Cavill Proteas Pty Limited (which was
formerly known as Cavill Marine Services Pty Limited) had a ongoing
relationship with the plaintiff for some 15 years or so.  The defendants have
alleged that the plaintiff made errors in the bank
statements going back to
1988 and had they been aware of those errors that purportedly amount to about
$50,000 they would have sought
finance from other sources rather than agreeing
the 1997 loans with the plaintiff.  The plaintiff submitted all of these
disputed
transactions had been checked by the accountants acting for the first
defendant shortly after the details were made known to them
and those
accountants were satisfied that they were proper payments as they were cross
referenced within the company's ledgers. 

<P>

14  	The purpose of the 1997 loan facilities was to re-finance the
previous indebtedness of the company.  The plaintiff submitted
that to now go
back over past business dealings completely fails to impeach the debt which is
the subject of this judgment.  The
defendants acknowledge that it is only in
recent times that the defendants have sought to put several amounts in the bank
account
into dispute.  The defendants accepted the amount stipulated as
outstanding in their accounts when they sought to refinance the loans
in 1997.
It is my view that the plaintiff is correct in its submissions and the
defendants cannot now dispute errors that were made
prior to entering the 1997
loan agreements.  Hence it is my view that the defendants' defence is hopeless
and it is futile to grant
leave to file it.
<P>

15  	If I am wrong and the errors prior to 1997 are relevant I turn
to consider whether it can be argued that there were errors
made by the
plaintiff in the accounts.  The first defendant gave 5 specific examples of
alleged incorrect debiting of its account.
 These alleged incorrect debits
occurred between 1988 and 1993.  The loans that are the subject of these
proceedings were entered
into in 1997, well after these alleged discrepancies
occurred.  The defendants initially complained that their account was charged
a
commitment fee which was not stipulated in the loan agreement.  This charge was
$166 which according to the first defendant represented
an interest rate of
36%.  It was later conceded by the defendants that this submission was
incorrect.  
<P>

16  	Secondly, the first defendant has submitted that in the 1993
loan contract agreement, item 5(ii) stated that the loan fee was
not
applicable.  However on three occasions in March 1993, March 1994 and on 22
September 1994 the plaintiff debited the account
of the first defendant for the
sum of $340 on each occasion.  The first defendant contended that these debited
amounts have now increased
the value of the debt by $2,000 at present value.
The plaintiff conceded that there may have been errors and if so, the amount
due
and owing under the judgment debt could be reduced by $2,000.
<P>

17  	The third complaint is that in 1998 the bank referred to
interest payments as miscellaneous debits and instead of applying
the interest
rate of 15.5% it applied a rate of 16.5% and referred to a sum of $2,199.80.
The loan conditions are set out in a document
dated 6 April 1998.  Paragraph
(7) provides:
<P>

<b>"7(a)	Interest shall be payable on the full amount from time to time owing
on the Loan Account (calculated on daily balances) on the
days set out in Item
3 of the Schedule or on such other days as the Bank may from time to time
determine;</b>
<P>

<b>    (b)	Interest shall initially be calculated at the rate set out in Item 3
of the Schedule but the Bank may at any time hereafter
at its sole discretion
vary either by way of increase or decrease the said rate of interest conforming
with general movements in
the Bank's interest rates without any obligation on
the Bank to notify your Company of such variation.  PROVIDED THAT if a period
is set out in Item 3 of the Schedule the rate of interest set out in that Item
will apply for such period from the date of the initial
drawing of the Loan.
The rate of interest to apply to any balance remaining unpaid on the Loan
Account at the expiration of any such
period may be so varied by the Bank by
notice to your Company and will apply for such further period or periods as the
Bank may from
time to time determine.</b>
<P>

<b>	..."</b>
<P>

18  	The loan was not drawn down until 2 August 1988.  The bank had a
discretion to vary the interest rate.  At the time of the
loan being drawn down
the rate of interest may have increased and the plaintiff was entitled to
charge the higher rate of interest.
 It is my view that this allegation cannot
succeed.
<P>

19  	The fourth complaint by the first defendant is that there were
concealed applications of penalty interest rates charged on
the overdraft
account in 1989.  The first defendant referred to a letter dated 21 June 1989
which advised of the renewal of a $25,000
overdraft facility.  It stated that
the initial interest rate was 21.75% being at the banks base lending rate plus
2% and also stated
that the base rate was published at regular intervals in the
Sydney Morning Herald.  The first defendant stated that this interest
rate
stipulated above was not clear in this letter but that in the letter dated 14
August 1990 the reference to the calculation on
the overdraft account was
clear.  I do not think the first reference to the mode by which the interest
rate was calculated was unclear.
 The first defendant complained at the
interest rate charged at 27 December 1989.  The limit on the overdraft at that
time was $25,000
yet the account was in debit in the sum of $110,000.  There
were other times when a higher interest rate was charged when the debit
in the
overdraft account exceeded the limit.  The plaintiff was entitled to charge a
higher rate of interest.  This allegation is
without merit.
<P>

20  	The first defendant's fifth concern was that the plaintiff for
interest calculation divided each year by 365 days regardless
of whether it was
a leap year (366 days).  The defendants referred to <b><u>Re Clubb v Westpac
Banking Corporation</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2093%20ALR%20123" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 93 ALR 123</a>, a decision of the Federal Court
in respect of bankruptcy proceedings where Burchett J observed:
<P>

<b>"When Julius Caesar decreed that from the year now known as 45 BC onwards
there should be adopted the Julian calendar, with its provision
for recurring
bissextile or leap years, he not only set the scene for a well known Gilbertian
jest; he also set the scene for the
problem posed by the present case. For the
basic question is whether, in calculating a proportionate amount, for a part of
a year,
of interest due at a yearly rate, the year in question being a leap
year, it is permissible to convert the yearly sum to a daily
rate by dividing
by 365, or whether it is essential to include the intercalary day, thus making
the divisor 366."</b>
<P>

21  	His Honour held that the notice of bankruptcy served by the bank
on its customer was bad because it is erroneous to calculate
interest, for
periods of days included in a year of 366 days, by a calculation which assumes
a year of 365 days.  When a leap year
occurred, a year must be understood to
mean 366 days.  His Honour continued: 
<P>

<b>"The courts have declined to treat 365 days as a standard or conventional
year when a leap year was involved.  The method used by
the bank in the present
case produced in respect of a leap year a total charged for interest exceeding
that which the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a> (NSW) imposed.  It also produced the
curious anomaly, if applied to the portion of a leap year consisting of 365
days, that the interest
for that portion of the leap year would be identical
with the interest which could lawfully be exacted for the full leap
year."</b>
<P>

22  	The situation in the case before me differs from
<b><u>Clubb</u></b> because from at least 1996 and in particular in relation to
the 1997 loans (the subject of these proceedings) in the document called
renewal advice under the heading "Interest rate: there is a clause which
stipulated that the bank calculates interest daily at the
annual percentage
rate divided by 365 on the unpaid daily bank balance of the facility at the end
of each day.  This ground of defence
cannot succeed.
<P>

23  	The defendants also submitted that they were charged a higher
interest rate in 1991 after the contract had expired and relied
on the standard
practice of the bank but did not have any evidence of the standard practice.
Rather, it seems that after a contract
expired, the bank charged interest at
the current rate for that particular type of loan.  This ground of defence was
not made out.
 In summary, the defendants are not entitled to rely on alleged
errors made by the plaintiff prior to 1997 (I have held that they
are not).  At
best, only the argument concerning the loan application fee may be arguable.
It should be noted that the amount in
dispute in relation to those items is
allegedly $2,000 at present value.
<P>

24  	The defendants also complained about calculations in the
plaintiff's letter dated 22 April 1997.  Prior to entering the 1997
loans the
defendants received this letter which calculated total annual payments which
would be made under existing arrangements
and alternatively under a proposed
arrangement.  The proposed arrangement was the one which became the basis for
the 1997 loan. 
The existing arrangements required $67,973 to be repaid
annually and the proposed arrangement required $67,935 to be repaid annually.
The defendants asserted that there was an arithmetical error but "it was not a
decision affecting thing."  Hence, this complaint
does not constitute a
defence.
<P>

25  	Finally, the defendants submitted that on the day the mortgage
was signed by Victoria Mary Brown (the sister of Mark Alfred
Cavill) she was
not in Taree.  However, Mr Cavill admitted he did not know when she signed the
mortgage nor when George Cavill (Mark
Cavill's father) signed the mortgage nor
when the common seal was affixed.  Once again this complaint does not give rise
to a defence.
<P>

26  	The defendants referred to 9 years of struggle they had endured
to keep the business afloat.  They stated that each small amount
made a
difference.  Mr Cavill on behalf of the defendants spoke of their desire to
save the family farm which is the subject of separate
legal proceedings.  While
the court has sympathy for the situation in which the defendants find
themselves, it cannot be said that
they have a bona fide defence.  In my view
the defence they have sought to raise is futile.  There have not been any
fraudulent concealments
or misrepresentations in relation to the 1997 loan.
The defendants have sought to find small errors in the accounts from 1988 to
1998 which do not furnish them with a defence.  It is my view that justice is
best served if leave to file a defence and cross claim
is refused.  The notice
of motion is dismissed with costs.  As the motion is dismissed it is
unnecessary for the change of venue
issue to be decided.
<P>

27  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The defendants' notice of motion filed 20 April 1999 is dismissed.
<P>

(2)	The defendants are to pay the plaintiff's costs.
