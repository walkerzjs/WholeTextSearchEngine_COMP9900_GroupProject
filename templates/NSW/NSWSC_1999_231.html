ORS</b>
<P>

<b> </b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

 
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	In this matter the plaintiff seeks relief by way of interlocutory injunction
against the first defendant which is an organisation
registered pursuant to the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/wra1996220/" class="autolink_findacts">Workplace Relations Act 1996</a> (Cth) (the WRA) and the second defendant who is a
member of that organisation.  The defendants have moved for an order that the
proceedings
be transferred to the Federal Court of Australia under the
provisions of the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross Vesting) Act 1987.  The
application is made on 2 bases.  The first is that it is argued by the
defendant that s414 of the WRA removes from this Court jurisdiction
to deal
with these proceedings as being jurisdiction in relation to an act or omission
for which an organisation or member of an
organisation is "liable to be sued".
The application is also made on the basis that there are other proceedings
pending in the Federal
Court of Australia which, whilst not between the same
parties, relate to overlapping subject matter and that a trial in the Federal
Court would be more convenient.
<P>

2	The matter is of some urgency as a ship is scheduled to arrive in Newcastle
harbour on Thursday and the application for interlocutory
relief is in relation
to the handling of that ship.  It is true, as the plaintiff has objected, that
application for the transfer
of the proceedings was not made until this
morning, although the interlocutory application has been pending in this Court
for some
little time.  However, there is still time between now and Thursday
and the situation is that the time in this Court today up till
this moment has
been taken up by argument of or of matters preparatory to argument of the
transfer application.  Just as this Court
has facilities for dealing quickly
with matters that are urgent, similar facilities are in general terms available
in the Federal
Court of Australia in Sydney.  There is no reason to think they
are not available at the present time.  The substantive hearing has
not
commenced in this Court and can as well take place on an urgent basis in the
Federal Court as in this Court. 
<P>

3	On the front of the jurisdiction argument, Mr Trew, of Queen's Counsel for
the plaintiff, says that the jurisdictional point is
unarguable.  He says that
this follows from the decision of the High Court in <b>Williams v Hursey</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1959/51.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1959] HCA 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%20103%20CLR%2030" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959) 103 CLR 30</a> in relation to s147 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act
1904 (Cth), which had considerable similarity to the terms of the present
s414
of the WRA.  However, s147 was, as I understand it, repealed with the
Conciliation and Arbitration Act in 1988. The replacing
Act did not contain a
similar provision, but s414 was inserted in the present legislation in 1993.
Whatever the precise legislative
history, which there has not been time to
research, it is undoubted that the words of the 2 sections are significantly
different.
 The section is differently constructed and the words "in respect of
which the Court has jurisdiction" do not appear in s414.  Mr
Trew has argued
that they are unnecessary because of the reconstruction of the sentence and
that the section is of identical effect.

<P>

4	However, it does not seem to me that it is unarguable that the effect is
different and that the jurisdiction of this Court is
excluded in the present
proceedings.  Mr Trew has said that the defendants' argument will evaporate on
analysis.  There is not time
for analysis.  So long as there is an argument,
even if it not be a particularly strong one, I think that there is an important
reason,
from the point of view of the administration of justice in this federal
society, why the matter should, under the provisions of the
cross vesting
legislation, be sent to the Federal Court.  If this Court proceeds in the
matter, which is a matter of some public
interest and public controversy, and
grants interlocutory relief of the type sought by the plaintiff, the argument
may then well
be pursued that, in a difficult and contentious situation, this
Court has made its orders without jurisdiction.  I think it is most
undesirable
in the interests of the administration of justice that that sort of situation
should arise.
<P>

5	As I have already said, similar facilities are available in the Federal Court
in Sydney for dealing with this matter in an urgent
way and the matter has not
proceeded in this Court beyond the jurisdictional argument.  I am of the view
that the matter should proceed
beyond this point in the Federal Court of
Australia in Sydney, and I propose to order that the proceedings be transferred
to that
Court in its New South Wales District Registry.  Mr Trew has asked, in
view of the lateness of the application, that I should make
it a condition of
making such an order that some form of undertaking by the defendants as to
future conduct ought to be exacted as
the price of the order, but as I think
the matter should now proceed in the Federal Court I do not believe that the
situation should
be trammelled by such a condition imposed by this Court.  I do
not therefore propose to attach such a condition to the making of
the order I
propose.  As to costs, it may be that a day has been lost by the argument of
the transfer application.  The costs of
today will be reserved.
<P>

6	The orders that I make are that these proceedings, 1254/99 in the Equity
Division of this Court, be transferred to the Federal
Court of Australia, New
South Wales District Registry.  Costs of today are reserved.
