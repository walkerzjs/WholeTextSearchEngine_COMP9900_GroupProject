<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  This is an application by Stephen Arthur Maiden for
re-determination under s 13A <b><i>Sentencing Act 1987</i></b> of the life
sentence imposed on him by Hunt J at Grafton on 22 September 1988 following his
conviction for the murder of Mark Gerald
White at Glenreagh in November of
1987.  The Crown neither supports nor opposes the application.  
<P>

2	The Crown case at the trial was that the applicant and one Leslie Davidson
Petty, who were both escaped convicts on a spree of
criminal activity from
Adelaide through Sydney to the Queensland border, lured the victim, a young
seventeen year old who had been
hitchhiking and whom they had picked up, into
the bush and there killed him by breaking his neck and buried his body in a
shallow
grave.  The Crown alleged that there was a prior agreement between them
to kill the victim and that on a given signal from Petty,
the applicant
attacked the victim and during the ensuing struggle they fell to the ground
where the applicant had the victim's neck
in a head lock, and by pushing very
hard and quickly against the side of his face attempted to break his neck, but
succeeded only
in rendering him unconscious, whereupon Petty came over, turned
the victim onto his stomach before grabbing him under the chin and
putting his
knees into the victim's back, thus breaking his neck from the rear.  
<P>

3	In a Record of Interview made on 16 February 1988, following his arrest, the
applicant said that he merely pushed the victim over
and went and dug the grave
whilst Petty killed him (answer 14) and the motive for the killing was that
they were concerned he would
get in the way of a truck which they were supposed
to "rip off" in Queensland (answer 68).  
<P>

4	In his evidence on this application he said that he and Petty were intending
to stop and rob a truck carrying a large quantity
of cigarettes from Queensland
to Sydney, and the victim was aware of this proposal and had agreed to be
involved in the crime, but
that Petty later suggested that he felt the victim
should be killed because he believed that he would go to the police or inform
the authorities that he and the applicant were in the area and had escaped from
gaol; and the applicant agreed to the plan because
at the time he regarded
Petty as a type of father figure and, as a criminal, he looked up to him.  
<P>

5	He said that when Petty gave him the signal he pushed the victim over, and
the latter fell over on his back, Petty then sat on
his stomach and held his
hands round his throat, whilst the applicant ran into the bush, and when he
came back, Petty had the victim
on his stomach, he thought he was unconscious
at the time and he saw Petty break his neck, whereupon Petty told him to go and
dig
a shallow grave, which he did.  
<P>

6	Petty and the applicant told quite a different story at the trial in unsworn
statements which the jury by their verdicts clearly
rejected and which the
learned trial judge described as "a tissue of lies".  In the absence of other
witnesses, it is difficult to
tell how much of the version now given by the
applicant is true, and precisely what part he physically played in carrying out
the
agreement between him and Petty to kill the deceased.  However, what is
clear beyond reasonable doubt is that there was an agreement
between them that
the victim should be killed for no good reason.  On any version he was part of
the agreement and on any version
he gave the deceased the initial push
preparatory to Petty breaking his neck, and whether he himself first tried to
break the deceased's
neck is not of any great significance.  It was therefore a
deliberate, callous, premeditated killing of a young man the killers had
given
a lift to, befriended and invited to join them in a proposed serious criminal
enterprise.  They then, so the applicant says,
brutally killed him by breaking
his neck because he knew about them and their plans and they feared he might
notify the police. 
I accept that the applicant was not the instigator of the
offence and was at the time under the influence of a considerably older
man.

<P>

7	The applicant was born on 24 June 1966 in Melbourne and so was twenty one
years old at the time of the murder.  At the age of
three or four he was placed
in an institution along with two of his brothers, and he remained in
institutional care until his mid
teens when he was briefly re-united with his
mother but shortly afterwards he was made a state ward.  From the age of
fifteen he
had a number of convictions mainly in Victoria for offences such as
theft, burglary, stealing motor cars, possess house breaking
implements and
escape from a youth training centre.  He served a number of short sentences and
ultimately in the District Court at
Goulburn on 4 June 1987 he was sentenced to
a total of four years penal servitude with a non-parole period of two years for
break,
enter and steal and forgery.  It was whilst serving this sentence at
Cooma that he and Petty escaped on 10 October 1987.  
<P>

8	They travelled to South Australia where they remained for several weeks and
then, with two others as travelling companions, they
left Adelaide in a stolen
motor vehicle on 21 November and drove through Northern Victoria to Sydney, and
they then travelled north
to Coff's Harbour, on the way picking up the deceased
and a young female companion on the Pacific Highway near Macksville.  After
going to Coff's Harbour, they headed for Grafton via Glenreagh and it was at
the latter place that the murder took place.  The remainder
of the group
continued travelling, committing a number of offences on the way, until Petty
and the applicant were ultimately arrested
on 29 January 1998 near Yass and
charged with escape from lawful custody.  Subsequently, after being
interviewed, both were charged
with the murder on 16 February 1988, and made
their first appearance on that charge at Goulburn Local Court that same day.

<P>

9	Following the sentence for murder, on the 27 March 1992, the applicant in the
District Court at Sydney before Gallen DCJ pleaded
guilty and was sentenced in
respect of a number of offences including the escape itself and also a number
of break, enter and steal,
and larceny offences, committed between the time of
the escape and the time of his re-arrest.  For escape lawful custody, the
applicant
was sentenced to a fixed term of two years to commence at the
expiration of the sentence being served at the time of the escape.
 His Honour
was informed that the sentence expired on 4 February 1990 and dated the
sentence for the escape from that date.  It has
since been ascertained that the
date of expiry of the sentence being served at the time of the escape was
miscalculated because the
time spent at large following the escape was not
taken into account and that correctly calculated the date of expiry of the
original
sentence should have been 31 March 1990.  Most of the other sentences
were for lesser periods or back dated and were made concurrent
with that one,
but on a charge of larceny of a motor vehicle from Werris Creek on 19 January
1988 he was sentenced to a minimum term
of three years to date from the date of
sentencing (ie 27 March 1992) with an additional term of one year.  His Honour
was of course
aware that the sentences he was imposing were largely academic
because of the life sentence that had already been imposed on the
applicant,
but it follows that until 26 March 1995 the applicant was serving sentences for
the escape and the offences committed
whilst at large.  I shall come back to
this aspect of the matter.
<P>

10	After being sentenced for the murder on 11 October 1988, the applicant was
classified A2 in Goulburn Correctional Centre.  In
1991 whilst at the Reception
Prison at Long Bay, where he had been moved temporarily to facilitate court
appearances, he wrote a
letter indicating that he had decided that he should do
something to improve his life by undertaking education with a view to obtaining
employment on his ultimate release, and he also at about this time obtained a
position as head sweeper in which position he performed
well.  Up until this
stage he had been on protection, but in 1992 he undertook and successfully
completed a Motivation and Attitude
Development course which became available
to selected young inmates in protective custody, although it was necessary for
them to
cease being on protection whilst undergoing the programme.  In November
1994 at his own request he was placed back in protective
custody because he was
experiencing difficulties with two fellow inmates and as a result he lost his
employment as clerk in the Office
of the Assistant Superintendent of
Industries.  
<P>

11	On 14 January 1995, he was listed for transfer to Goulburn but deliberately
inflicted wounds on himself and was subsequently
transferred to Lithgow on 28
February 1995.  
<P>

12	Since about 1991 he has undertaken a number of courses particularly in the
computer field and acquired a number of skills.  He
has generally received good
reports.  There have been some blemishes, including charges of cannabis in
urine and attempts at self
harm and a period at Lithgow Correctional Centre
about 1995 when he was depressed.  He was re-classified B in September 1995 and
transferred to Grafton Correctional Centre where he worked in the print shop
but he was on protection and the print shop was subsequently
transferred to the
minimum security section of the gaol.  Apart from using cannabis and on
occasions drugs such as Rohypnol etc,
he has not been a heavy drug user and in
particular he has not used heroin since he was a youth.  He has been attending
alcohol and
other drug courses.  Whilst at Lithgow he went on the Methadone
program in an attempt to obtain medication for depression which he
was then
suffering rather than to deal with heroin dependency.  
<P>

13	In September 1997 he was transferred to Junee Correctional Centre, which is
wholly a protection institution.  He subsequently
applied to undertake the
Special Care Programme which caters for inmates with behavioural problems which
manifest in self defeating
behaviour, and at the time of hearing, the result of
his application was not known, although the assessment committee had met.  He
was undertaking a pre-university training course, working in the cable factory
and doing a woodwork course.  He gave evidence before
me that his hopes for the
future included successfully completing the course at the Special Care Unit,
improving himself as a person
to gain life skills so that hopefully one day he
can integrate back into society.  He hopes to obtain further educational skills
particularly in the computing and social science fields.  
<P>

14	He has been assessed by Dr Lucas, psychiatrist, whose diagnosis was that
although he was not suffering from a major psychiatric
disorder at the time of
the murder, since being in prison he has had recurrent episodes of depression
which he describes as "an adjustment
disorder with depressed mood".  At times
paranoid feelings have also been apparent.  He expressed the view that the
applicant is
suffering a personality disorder but its severity is difficult to
assess as he has spent little time out of institutions with no
real
opportunities to demonstrate how he can function in the community.  There were
indications from his recent time in prison that
he's settling down and can
apply himself to studies and employment and is motivated to do something about
himself.  
<P>

15	Both to Dr Lucas and in his evidence before me he has accepted
responsibility for his role in the murder and expressed contrition
for it.  In
his application to be admitted to the Special Care Unit (10 October 1998) the
applicant set out his list of goals if
accepted for the programme as
follows:
<P>

	1.	Anger management;
<P>

	2.	Assertiveness skills;
<P>

	3.	Learn the signs that manifest when reaching a state of depression, 	anger,
procrastination;
<P>

	4.	Learn to put into practice rational thinking dissociated from 	negative
emotions during stressful situations; and
<P>

	5.	Break the cycle of repetitive thought patterns linked to the past 	which
are negative to his behaviour.
<P>

This list in my view shows an awareness of his current problems and a desire to
overcome them.  
<P>

16	The overall impression which I get is that in time he will reach a stage
where he should be able to reintegrate into the community;
that time has not
yet come but the issue is not whether the time has yet arrived but whether
there is a prospect of it occurring
in the future.  The fixing of a minimum
term does not determine the date of his release, that is a matter for the
Parole Board subject
to the considerations set out in s 17 of the
<b><i>Sentencing Act 1987</i></b>, and I am satisfied that this is an
appropriate case for re-determination of the life sentence.
<P>

17	The determination of the fresh sentence is complicated by the factors to
which I have already referred, namely the fact that
at the time of the murder
he was an escapee from an outstanding sentence, which had to be completed on
his recapture, and he has
since been sentenced for the escape itself and a
number of other offences committed whilst at large.  A similar situation
concerning
escapees committing murder and other offences and being sentenced
separately for the escape and other offences arose in <b><i>R v Purdey</i></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2065%20A%20Crim%20R%20441" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 65 A Crim R 441</a> affirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeal  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2031%20NSWLR%20668" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 31 NSWLR
668</a>, SLR  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20691" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 691n</a> and <b><i>R v Haggart </i></b>(unreported -
Dunford J - 19 November 1993).  
<P>

18	In respect of the escape and other offences committed whilst at large, a
number of concurrent and partly concurrent sentences
were imposed by Judge
Gallen on 27 March 1992 the overall effect of which was that the longest
minimum term expired 26 March 1995.
 
<P>

19	At the time he was taken into custody on 29 January 1988 he was an escapee
and so continued serving his pre-existing sentences
which did not expire until
31 March 1990, by which time he had been sentenced for the murder (on 21
September 1988).  Accordingly
when remanded in custody on 16 February 1988 it
was not for this offence, and the appropriate date under s 13A (5) for
commencement
of the minimum term to be set on this application is the date on
which the original sentence commenced (i.e. 21 September 1988):
<b><i>R v
Purdey</i></b>.
<P>

20	Although the sentence must be backdated to the date of the original
sentence, in calculating its length, these other outstanding
sentences must not
be disregarded as otherwise the applicant would in effect only be punished for
the murder and not for the other
offences.  As Hunt J said in <b><i>R v
Purdey</i></b> at 65 A Crim R at 447:
<P>

	"As the judge resentencing pursuant to s 13A is precluded from making the
fresh sentence cumulative upon others which the prisoner
was serving when the
original life sentence was imposed - or would have been serving when sentenced
for the murder in the ordinary
course of events - he or she must therefore make
the sentence for murder longer to take those other crimes into account,
provided
that the sentence imposed for the murder remains individually
proportionate to the crime for which it is imposed.  Again, to hold
otherwise
would effectively mean that the applicant would not be punished for those other
crimes."
<P>

This passage was approved by the Court of Criminal Appeal at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=31%20NSWLR%20668" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">31 NSWLR 668</a> at
680 per Carruthers J with whom on this point the other members of the Court
agreed.  Moreover, it is necessary to fix a sentence
for the murder which
reflects the seriousness of that offence and takes into account protection of
the public, retribution, general
and personal deterrence, as well as
rehabilitation:  <b><i>R v Purdey</i></b>.  But regard must also be had to the
principle of totality with the result that the additional term to be served for
the murder will
be less than it would have been if it had stood alone as a
single offence and he were being sentenced for it in isolation.
<P>

21	Taking these factors into account I consider the additional minimum term
which should be added to the other sentences (that is
to be served beyond 26
March 1995) is twelve years, which as I say is considerably less than would
have been an appropriate minimum
term for this offence if it had stood alone,
but it must be fixed by reference to a commencement date of 21 September
1988.
<P>

22	Stephen Arthur Leslie Maiden, for the murder of Mark Gerald White I
re-sentence you to penal servitude for a minimum term of
eighteen and a half
years and it shall be deemed to have commenced on 21 September 1988.  I fix an
additional term of six years;
the earliest date on which you will be eligible
to be released on parole will be 20 March 2007.
