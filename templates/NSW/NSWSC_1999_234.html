<b>1719/99	GREGORY JOHN DAVID SCHOLTEN v MOBILESOFT PTY LIMITED &amp;
ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	These are proceedings brought by Gregory John David Scholten against
Mobilesoft Pty Limited and two associated companies and three
individuals who
are directors of the defendant companies.  The relief sought by the present
application is set out in an amended
notice of motion filed today and is a
restraint of the defendants from treating the purported termination of 12 March
1999 of an
agreement for service, or consulting agreement, between the
plaintiff and the first defendant as valid.  A further injunction is
sought
restraining the defendants from passing any resolution purporting to terminate
that agreement.  The principal proceedings
in which this interlocutory
application is brought are proceedings under the s 246AA of the Corporations
Law, which provides for
relief to be given in the case of oppression of
minority shareholders.  The company, Mobilesoft Pty Limited, was formed in
about
1995 and at that time the plaintiff invested money in Mobilesoft or
associated companies, and the agreement for his services, the
subject of the
present application, was entered into.
<P>

2	The letter of 2 July 1995 which sets out the terms of the agreement is
somewhat diffuse in its terms.  Indeed it is even difficult
to tell from it
whether the agreement creates a relationship of employer/employee or
constitutes a contract for the provision of
services.  The parties describe the
arrangement by that much abused word "consultancy" and the situation is
sufficiently unclear
for counsel for both parties not to put firm submissions,
as the matter stands, as to whether the relationship is one of employer
and
employee rather than some other sort of arrangement.  I tend to the view, as
the matter stands, that an employer/employee relationship
was not created.  It
does appear to me, on the material that has been able to be presented in the
short time available, that the
relationship is certainly one in which the
plaintiff and one or more of the defendants do work closely together in an
office in Sydney,
the rest of the plaintiff's establishment being in Melbourne.
On that material, this is a case in which the contract requires people
to work
in close proximity and in a close personal relationship.  I should say that
this situation may change upon more ample evidence
being available at a later
time; in particular, the defendants have not at this stage filed any affidavit
evidence at all.
<P>

3	The evidence filed by the plaintiff, whilst leaving uncertainties in some
regards, does establish facts from which an arguable
case of oppression of a
minority shareholder could clearly be inferred if the evidence remained as it
is.  Perhaps more importantly
in the context of the present situation, in my
view the plaintiff's evidence shows an arguable case that the purported
dismissal
of the plaintiff from his contract is invalid as being effected
without appropriate authority of the first defendant, from which
he was
dismissed.  The circumstances of the dismissal are that on 12 March this year
Thomas Sims, who is a director of the first
defendant, handed the plaintiff a
letter to the effect that the plaintiff's "services are no longer required".
He signed that letter
as such director.  It has been properly and frankly
conceded by Mr Reitano, of counsel for the defendants, that no directors'
meeting
of the first defendant was held prior to that time, or during the month
of March 1999 up to the present time, and there is no suggestion
there was a
meeting of directors at which the dismissal of the plaintiff from his contract
was authorised.  Mr Reitano points to
the fact that the letter was handed over
by Mr Tom Sims in the presence of Mr Brian Sims, who is described in various
parts of the
evidence as the managing director of the defendant company, but
there is no clear evidence as to whether Mr Brian Sims is formally
appointed as
managing director of the company or, if he is, as to the extent of his
authority. In any event it is certainly arguable
that the act of dismissal was
the sole act of Mr Tom Sims.  Without further evidence as to the ambit of his
authority, there must
be an arguable case that he did not have the authority to
effect the dismissal:  see <b>Northside Developments Pty Ltd v
Registrar-General</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/32.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 32</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20170%20CLR%20146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 170 CLR 146</a> at 205.
<P>

4	So far as the balance of convenience at this point is concerned, it seems to
me that the plaintiff would suffer serious damage
if treated as peremptorily
dismissed, whereas the first defendant would not suffer great damage by a
restraint preventing it from
treating this purported act of dismissal as
effective.  It has been suggested that the injunction, if granted, would be
nugatory,
since it follows as the night the day that a directors' meeting will
be held which will effect the dismissal, and therefore an injunction
ought not
be granted.  However, there are six directors of this company, a meeting has
not been held and on the evidence I do not
think it may be taken as a foregone
conclusion that the dismissal will be persisted in.
<P>

5	In those circumstances, I propose to grant an injunction restraining the
defendants from treating the purported dismissal of 12
March 1999 as valid.
<P>

6	I am asked by Mr Ashhurst, of counsel for the plaintiff, to go further and
grant an injunction restraining any dismissal of the
plaintiff from his
contract.  This I am not prepared on the present evidence to do.  On the
present evidence, the contract may be
a contract of employment and in any event
it is, as I have already said, so far as I can see on the comparatively thin
evidence available,
a contract which requires close interaction and
co-operation between the plaintiff on the one hand and other directors and
staff
of the first defendant on the other.  At the moment I do not see features
that take the case out of the rule long accepted in Courts
of Equity that
contracts of employment, or that otherwise require the close co-operation of
the parties, will in general terms not
be enforced by decrees of specific
performance or by injunction:  see <b>J C Williamson Ltd v Lukey</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1931/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1931] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281931%29%2045%20CLR%20282" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1931) 45
CLR 282</a> and <b>Hogg v Dymock</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACSR%2014" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 ACSR 14</a> at 20.  For those reasons I
refuse to grant an injunction more general than that I have already indicated
my intention to grant.
<P>

7	Mr Reitano has submitted that the only order that I ought make is that the
costs of the application for injunction be costs in
the cause, simply by reason
of the failure of the plaintiff on one arm of his application for injunctions.
However, the defendants
appeared to oppose the grant of any restraint.  The
plaintiff has obtained a restraint from the Court and has therefore in my view
been substantially successful in its application and I propose to make the
usual order for costs made in favour of a successful applicant
for a restraint,
namely, that the costs of the application for injunctive relief be the
plaintiff's costs in the cause.
