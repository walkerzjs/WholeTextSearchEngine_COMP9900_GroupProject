<P>

<b> </b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

 
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	These proceedings were commenced by notice of motion filed on 19 February
1999 claiming relief by way of Mareva injunction against
the first defendant
who was or had been an employee of the plaintiff and her fiance, the second
defendant.  The allegation was that
the first defendant, whilst an employee of
the plaintiff, had misappropriated funds of the plaintiff in sums which might
total as
much as $600,000.  Relief by way of Mareva injunction freezing the
assets of the defendants was granted, initially on an ex parte
basis on 18
February 1999 before the commencement of the proceedings, and has since been
continued.  At the same time it was ordered
that the defendants inform the
plaintiff in writing of their assets inside or outside Australia and this has
since been done in the
form of affidavits which have been filed.
<P>

2	However, a further order was sought and was made by Hodgson CJ in Eq on 8
March 1999.  Those orders were as follows:
<P>

"1	Orders made by Windeyer J on 22 February 1999 that each of the First
Defendant and the Second Defendant file and serve affidavits
by 4.00 p.m. on 25
February 1999 outlining their best knowledge, information and belief the facts
[sic] relating to the cashing of
the cheques contained in the schedule to the
Notice of Motion dated 22 February 1999 and the current whereabouts of the
proceeds
of those cheques and of any property derived directly or indirectly
from such proceeds be varied so as to require the bringing of
such affidavits
to Court at 10.00 a.m. on 19 March 1999.
<P>

2	Costs to be costs in the cause.
<P>

3	Proceedings be relisted before the Duty Judge at 10.00 a.m. on 19 March
1999.
<P>

The Court notes:
<P>

1	The Court notes that it is intended that on 19 March 1999, the deponents will
be present and that objection against self-incrimination
will be taken in
relation to the affidavits referred to in Order 1 above, whereupon the Court
will consider whether the Defendants
be given a certificate under section 128
of the NSW <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> (1995) in respect of the evidence given in the
affidavits."
<P>

His Honour in making orders in that form adopted the course that had previously
been followed in this Court by Young J in <b>HPM Industries Pty Limited v
Graham</b> 17 July 1996, unreported and by myself in <b>National Australia Bank
Limited v Rusu</b> 6 April 1998, unreported.  The defendants now move upon a
notice of motion filed in Court on 19 March 1999 for the revocation of
the
orders made by Hodgson CJ in Eq.
<P>

3	The foundation on which the application is made is that there is now a
criminal prosecution commenced and pending against the
first defendant.  It is
said, furthermore, that the existence of that prosecution increases the
likelihood of the prosecution of
the second defendant, but it is principally
upon the actual existence of a criminal prosecution against the first defendant
that
the defendants rely in bringing this motion.  They draw attention to the
fact that there was no prosecution pending when Young J
followed the course
that his Honour did in the <b>HPM Industries </b>case.  It is, as they concede
is apparent, that a criminal prosecution had already been brought against one
of the defendants in the
<b>Rusu</b> case decided by me, and that I had
nonetheless made orders of the type under question in that case.  Mr Simpson,
of counsel for the
defendants, points to the basic nature of the rule against
self incrimination and says that, once a criminal prosecution is actually
on
foot, this should preclude compulsory revelations.  As far as the protection
afforded by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> is concerned, he does not, I think,
say that that is totally illusory.  But he points to the fact that the evidence
will be necessarily
put into the hands of the very organisation that has
complained to the police, leading to the prosecution.  He also points to the
fact that documents can accidentally be transmitted or come into the hands of
people they are not intended for, and he points to
the difficulty which he says
that the accused person will be under of demonstrating that it is through the
information coming into
the hands of the prosecuting authority that some step
that has been taken by that authority or some advantage gained by it in the
conduct of the prosecution.  
<P>

4	There is some substance, particularly in this last point.  However, without
derogating in any way from the importance of the basic
rule against
self-incrimination, it does seem to me that the circumstances are very remote
whereby the accused person may be disadvantaged
in this case.  First, either
somebody must act totally improperly and convey the material which will be
produced pursuant to the
order to the prosecuting authority, or it must by some
possible but quite strange accident fall into its hands.  It must participate
in using it improperly, and the use must be such that it is unable to be
demonstrated by the accused.  While it is conceivable that
this last problem
may arise, there will be other circumstances in which improper use is made
where that use can be demonstrated.
 It is only therefore in my view, as I have
said, a very remote chance that harm may be done.
<P>

5	I am asked to revoke the Chief Judge's order.  The applicant for revocation
bears the burden of showing that it should be revoked.
 I can see no reason
sufficient for revoking it.  In one sense it was not necessary for me to see
the material available at the time
the Chief Judge made the order, but as it is
a case which involves the liberty of the subject, I have asked that that
material be
laid before me and I have considered it before coming to my
decision on the motion.  It does seem to me upon viewing that evidence
that
there is a strong prima facie case that funds were taken by the first defendant
which the plaintiff in these proceedings is
now seeking to recover.  Against
the very remote possibility of any harm coming to the defendants in any
untoward way, I must balance
the plaintiff's rights - if the case of
misappropriation be ultimately proved - to attempt to find and trace the funds
before the
trail becomes cold.  It certainly will have become cold if it cannot
be pursued until after the termination of criminal proceedings
at first
instance, and perhaps upon appeal.
<P>

6	In all the circumstances, I decline to revoke the orders made by the Chief
Judge and I shall proceed to fix a time at which the
relevant affidavits ought
be brought into court so that they may be dealt with under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>, as envisaged by the Chief Judge.  I note that in <b>HPM
Industries Pty Ltd (No 2)</b>, 28 August 1996, Young J changed his view as to
the appropriateness of affidavits as ordered in his first judgment, rather than
oral
examination.  In my view, his Honour's earlier view did not need revision
in this way.  In this case, the Chief Judge has ordered
affidavits and there
has been no suggestion that his Honour's order ought be varied in this regard.
I propose to add a direction
that the prosecuting authority be informed so
that, if it desires, it may appear at that time and ask that the affidavits not
be
read.  There was some suggestion on the defendants' behalf during address
that this appeared to show some preference for the interests
of the prosecution
over those of the accused.  I do not believe that is so.  It does give the
prosecution the opportunity to object
to the course, but if the prosecution
does so and its objection is upheld, then the accused's rights, to any extent
they are trenched
upon by the making of this order, will be completely restored
to it by the destruction of the affidavits, so that they are not then
in any
way disadvantaged.  This appears to me to hold an even balance between the
parties to the criminal prosecution and not in
any way to favour either of them
so far as those proceedings are concerned.
<P>

LATER: 
<P>

7	Having said what I have said, there is one regard in which the Chief Judge's
order calls for variation.  That relates to the inclusion
in the order of the
words "the facts relating to the cashing of the cheques contained in the
schedule to the Notice of Motion". Those
words are very wide and I believe
somewhat uncertain.  It seems to me undesirable that there should be words as
wide and uncertain
as that in an order of this nature.  Upon this being drawn
to attention, the plaintiff indicated that it would be satisfied if those
words
were removed from the order in relation to its future operation and has
maintained that attitude.  In light of that concession,
I propose to vary the
orders by the removal of those words.
<P>

8	The question of costs has been argued before me.  What was principally sought
by the defendants was the revocation of the Chief
Judge's orders and in that
they have failed.  There has been some modification of the orders but that
modification was consented
to by the plaintiff.  The obtaining of that
modification in those circumstances is not sufficient to justify departure from
the usual
rule that costs follow the event.  Mr Simpson, of counsel for the
defendants, has pressed upon me the nature of the matter and the
impecuniosity
of the defendants to justify departure from the usual rule, but I do not think
it appropriate that it be departed from.
 The order for costs that I propose to
make therefore is that the defendants be ordered to pay the plaintiff's costs
of the motion.
