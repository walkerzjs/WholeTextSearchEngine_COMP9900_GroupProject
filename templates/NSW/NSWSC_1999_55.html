ACTS CITED: 
<P>

DECISION: 
<P>

Appeal allowed.  Notice of Motion dismissed.
<P>

JUDGMENT: 
<P>

- 6 -
<P>

1	On 3 June 1998 Master Harrison struck out the plaintiff's statement of claim.
On 27 July 1998 Greg James J upheld the Master's
decision.  On 3 November 1998
the Master held that an amended statement of claim filed by the plaintiff was
defective and, on this
occasion, dismissed the proceedings.  There is an appeal
from that determination.
<P>

2	There is also which, so far as is material, seeks the addition of two
plaintiffs namely, Halisa-NSW Partnership (Halisa) and OIC
EAIM Project Team
(OIC).
<P>

3	The central theme of the Master's determination of 3 November 1998 was that
the statement of claim is purportedly brought by the
plaintiff on behalf of
other entities which are not plaintiffs and which have not consented to be
joined as plaintiffs. 
<P>

4	I have to say that this is not correct.  The amended statement of claim, as
initially engrossed, specified three plaintiffs in
the entitleture, namely, Mr
Gould, Halisa and OIC.  The plaintiff, Halisa and OIC were designated as the
First, Second and Third
plaintiffs.  Halisa and OIC were struck through in the
entitleture at the time of filing.  The body of the amended statement of claim
commenced, however, as follows:
<P>

	"The plaintiffs <i>(plural)</i> plead their cause of action as follows:
<P>

	A.	At all material times the First Plaintiff was a Partner in a firm of
Management Consultants.
<P>

	B.	At all material times the First Plaintiff was the Public Officer of an
unincorporated association called the OPEN INTERCHANGE
CONSORTIUM (OIC).  The
OIC is an organisation formed to raise awareness of Electronic Information
Technology (EIT) issues like the
Internet, Electronic Commerce and the Y2K
issue.
<P>

	C.	At all material times the First Plaintiff was the Project Manager of the
OIC Electronic Association Information Management (EAIM)
project."
<P>

The damages claimed subsequently in the pleading are particularised as
liquidated and unliquidated damages.  I pass over the former.
 The claim for
unliquidated damages includes the following:
<P>

	"H.	Unspecified damages for costs, damage to reputation and loss of earnings
for the First Plaintiff."
<P>

This is followed by claims for unliquidated damages "for the Second Plaintiff"
and "for the Third Plaintiff".
<P>

5	There is much that is unclear about the amended statement of claim but one
thing that is clear is that the proceedings are brought
on the plaintiff's' own
behalf, as well as purportedly on behalf of a second and third plaintiffs
(which are not identified in view
of the words struck out in the entitleture).

<P>

6	The Master was thus in error in treating the amended statement of claim as
not including a claim by the plaintiff on his own behalf.
 The determination by
the Master must accordingly be set aside, and I am to exercise the discretion
of the Court afresh on the defendant's
application. 
<P>

7	The amended statement of claim includes assertions under three headings,
namely, False Misrepresentation, Breach of Contract and
Management Negligence.
As to the assertions made under the second and third headings, the statement of
claim is defective.  No reasonable
cause of action is disclosed.
<P>

8	As to the assertions made under the heading, False Misrepresentation, the
gravamen of the allegation appears to be that the defendants
gained entry to a
lunchtime lecture by deception, engaged the plaintiff in a filmed interview by
deception (in which serious assertions
were made and put to him), and falsely
led the plaintiff to believe that he would have an opportunity to submit a
response to those
assertions before a television programme involving the
interview went to air, with consequent damage to the plaintiff.
<P>

9	This segment of the amended statement of claim is also defective.  It does
not specify with sufficient clarity the facts relied
upon to support a cause of
action in deceit.  Put another way, the defendants are not sufficiently
apprised of a case they are required
to meet.
<P>

10	It is a relevant consideration that the plaintiff has demonstrated an
inability to plead a cause of action in a way that is acceptable.
 I do not
believe that he has the capacity to do so.  Few people would, without legal
training.  Left to his own devices, a further
amended statement of claim would
almost certainly be defective.  However, assuming the plaintiff to be indigent
(which appears to
be the case), he might be able to secure legal assistance
through the pro bono schemes of The Law Society of New South Wales or The
New
South Wales Bar Association.  It is not a foregone conclusion, therefore, that
a further amended statement of claim will necessarily
be defective because of
the plaintiff's lack of legal training.
<P>

11	The plaintiff may have a good cause of action for deceit.  Notwithstanding
that there have been two unsuccessful attempts to
plead a cause of action
satisfactorily, it seems to me that justice requires the plaintiff be given a
further opportunity to do so
in the circumstances of this case.  Accordingly,
the amended statement of claim should be struck out but leave should be given
to
file a further amended statement of claim limited to a cause of action for
deceit.
<P>

12	As to the notice of motion seeking to join Halisa and OIC as plaintiffs,
there is no satisfactory evidence of the existence of
these organisations as
legal entities and no satisfactory evidence of their consent to be joined as
plaintiffs.  Accordingly, the
notice of motion should be dismissed.
<P>

13	I am informed from the bar table that the plaintiff has now commenced
defamation proceedings against the television channel concerned
and one of the
present defendants.  No order has been sought for consolidation.  It may be
that the best course for the plaintiff
to follow would be to amend the
statement of claim in the defamation proceedings by adding a claim in deceit
rather than seek to
maintain the two sets of proceedings allegedly arising out
of the same events.  It might also be that, if the plaintiff fails to
take that
course, the present defendants might apply to have these proceedings
transferred to the defamation list with a view to
consolidation with the
defamation proceedings.
<P>

14	The orders I make are as follows:
<P>

(1)	Decision of Master Harrison given on 3 November 1998 set aside.
<P>

	(2)	Amended statement of claim struck out.
<P>

(3)	Leave to the plaintiff to file and serve a further amended statement of
claim limited to a cause of action for deceit by 4.00
pm on 12 March 1999.
<P>

(4)	Plaintiff to pay the defendants' costs of the appeal.
<P>

(5)	Notice of motion filed on 7 December 1998 (for the addition of plaintiffs)
dismissed.
<P>

(6)	Plaintiff to pay the defendants' costs of the motion.
<P>
