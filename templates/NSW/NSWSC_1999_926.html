<center><b><u>Regina  v  Jason Paul Maslen</u></b>
<P>

<b>Remarks on Sentence: Ex tempore</b>
<P>

1    	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  The prisoner, Jason Paul Maslen,
was indicted for murder and in the alternative for accessory before the fact to
robbery.  He pleaded
guilty to that alternative charge, which the Crown
accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment.  
<P>

2    	Last Friday, 13 August, I dealt with a young
co-offender (<i>R v PHL</i>).  I set out briefly the facts of the matter when
sentencing that young man and there is no need to repeat them now.
<P>

3    	The evidence as to when it was the prisoner became
party to a plot to rob someone is conflicting.  When interviewed by police,
the
prisoner said that they had set out in the car for that very purpose.  In
evidence before me, there was a suggestion of impropriety
on the part of the
interviewing police, but I do not find it necessary to resolve that matter and
at the end of the day it was not
pressed as a matter having any relevance to my
sentencing task.
<P>

4    	In evidence before me, the prisoner said that it was
only in the course of the journey that the question of robbing someone
was
raised and he became a party to the plan to do so.  Really, I do not think
anything much turns on the distinction and it is not
a factual issue which I
feel any need to resolve.  From the relatively meagre proceeds of the robbery
the prisoner himself received
five dollars.
<P>

5    	The incident had tragic results but I must emphasise,
as I did when dealing with the young co-offender, that the prisoner
stands for
sentence in relation to a charge of accessory before the fact to robbery and
not for any form of criminal responsibility
for that unfortunate lady's death.
In sentencing the prisoner I have regard to his role in the offence, which can
properly be classified
as somewhat less than that of the young co-offender.
This is not to deny the seriousness of offences of this kind.  There is no need
to repeat what I said about that when dealing with the young co-offender.
Crimes of this kind are very serious, whatever be the level
of involvement of
the particular offender.
<P>

6    	I take into account his plea of guilty and in
evidence before me he expressed remorse.  I also have regard to the fact that
for the best part of two years he was on bail subject to fairly stringent
conditions involving reporting to police and a curfew.
<P>

7    	The prisoner was twenty-five years old at the time of
the offence and is now twenty-seven.  He has no prior convictions. 
His
background is set out in a psychological assessment of Mr G. D. Fathers, which
I have found of considerable assistance.  I do
not see any need to summarise
that background now, except to observe that the prisoner clearly has had and
continues to have the
benefit of a supportive family.  It is equally clear that
he needs that benefit.  In the report, Mr Fathers himself commented that
away
from the family structure the prisoner seems not to be able to manage very well
for himself.  Clearly, that is so and the offence
occurred during a period when
he was in Sydney without the benefit of that family support and when he was
associating with youths
much younger than he.  Mr Fathers commented: "What
remains unexplained is his association with the juveniles and his willingness
to participate in the offence."
<P>

8    	Mr Fathers concluded that he exhibits features of a
schizoid personality disorder.  He added that he seems to be detached
from
social relationships and his range of emotional expression is limited.
Astutely, I might add, he commented: "While he may have
company about him, he
remains a solitary figure."  Mr Fathers concluded that the prisoner "has a
clinical psychological disorder
which needs further assessment and treatment
considerations.  The latter would not present as an easy task set to
manage".
<P>

9    	In the light of that material, it is common ground
that there are special circumstances warranting a longer than usual additional
term.  At pp8- 9 of his report, Mr Fathers comments upon the difficulties this
prisoner with his personality profile might face in
the prison system and I
invite the attention of that material to the Corrective Services authorities.
I repeat my recommendation
last Friday that great care be taken in his
management and that he be classified as soon as possible, and I recommend most
strongly,
if it be possible, that he serve the lion's share of his sentence at
Grafton so as to be within easy reach of his parents, so that
they can provide
the support which he needs so much.
<P>

10    	I do not consider that there is any question of
parity of sentence between this prisoner and the young offender whom I dealt
with last Friday.  As it happens, that offender had served some twenty months
in custody before I released him on probation but I
do not consider that term
any benchmark for arriving at the custodial portion of the sentence which this
prisoner must serve.  
<P>

11    	Senior counsel who appeared for the prisoner
submitted that a minimum term of the order of twelve months is appropriate and
in my view that submission is sound.  
<P>

12    	You are sentenced to penal servitude for two years,
comprising a minimum term of twelve months to date from 13 August 1999
and to
expire on 12 August 2000 and an additional term of twelve months.  I order that
you be released to parole on 13 August 2000
and that during that parole period
you submit to the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole
Service.
<P>
