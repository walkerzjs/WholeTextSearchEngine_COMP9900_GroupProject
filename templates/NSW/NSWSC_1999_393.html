THE SUPREME COURT

OF NEW SOUTH WALES
<P>

COMMON LAW DIVISION
<P>

MASTER MALPASS
<P>

FRIDAY 30 APRIL 1999
<P>

<u>12579 of 1998</u>	<u>STEPHEN GEORGE GOULD v JULIAN REGINALD DAY &amp;
ANOR</u>
<P>

<u>JUDGMENT</u>
<P>

1	The proceedings were commenced by Summons filed on 23 October 1998. The
purport of the Summons was the bringing of an appeal against
a decision of a
Costs Assessor.  An Amended Summons was filed on 23 November 1998.  It seeks
inter alia an order rescinding an earlier
order for costs and disbursements.
<P>

2	There are two defendants.  The defendants filed a Notice of Motion on 16
February 1999.  It seeks inter alia the dismissal of
the appeal.
<P>

3	The plaintiff has sworn two affidavits.  Each defendant has sworn an
affidavit.
<P>

4	The hearing took place on 21 April 1999.  All parties appeared in person.
There was considerable animosity.
<P>

5	It appears that the plaintiff had brought proceedings against the defendants
in the District Court.  The proceedings were resolved
in favour of the
defendants and the plaintiff was ordered to pay costs.
<P>

6	It appears that the defendants made application to this Court for an
assessment of costs pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s206.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 206</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act 1987</a> (the
Act).  The application was referred to a Costs Assessor ( Mr Scammell) for the
assessment of the party and party costs.  Thereafter,
communication took place
between the Costs Assessor and the parties.  The Costs Assessor issued a
Certificate As To Determination
Of Costs on 24 September 1998.  He determined
the application by assessing a fair and reasonable amount of costs in the sum
of $35,808.44
(the bill of costs had claimed $46,643-54).
<P>

7	The only appeal as of right is provided by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208L</a> of the Act.  It confers a
restricted avenue of appeal (as to a matter of law arising in the proceedings
to determine the application).
<P>

8	I have read the process and affidavits.  I have listened to the submissions
made by the parties.  The defendants contend that
the plaintiff's submissions
do not raise any question of law.  Much time has been devoted to matters which
have little or no bearing
on the real questions in issue.  The nature of the
submissions made appears from the affidavit material.  It is not necessary to
otherwise refer to those submissions.  The plaintiff placed stress on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p52" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52</a>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s37.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 37</a> of the SCR (a rule which has application where the costs are payable on
an indemnity basis).  It suffices to say that the submissions
made by the
plaintiff did not advance any arguable question of law.
<P>

9	The onus rests with the plaintiff to demonstrate an entitlement to relief.  I
am not satisfied that there is any matter of law
which would justify the
disturbing of the determination made by the Costs Assessor.  The relevant Costs
Order was made by the District
Court.  The Costs Order has not been the subject
of a successful appeal.  This Court has no power to disturb that Order.  It
follows
that the plaintiff's claims for relief must be dismissed.
<P>

10	The Notice of Motion filed by the defendants is otiose and misconceived.  It
does contain a prayer for interest.  No source of
power to make the order
sought has been identified.  Section 208JA of the Act enables the filing of the
Certificate in the appropriate
jurisdiction.  It is then taken as a judgment of
that court.  The entitlement to interest will be determined by the rules of
that
court.
<P>

11	I dismiss the Summons.  The plaintiff is to pay the costs of the Summons.
The defendants are to pay the costs (if any) of the
Notice of Motion.
<P>

I hereby certify that paragraphs 1-11 are the reasons for judgment of Master
Malpass.
<P>

Dated 30 April 1999.	(H D LEWIS)
<P>

				Associate.
