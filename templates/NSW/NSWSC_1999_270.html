<b>JUDGMENT  (Imputations - capacity - form - difference in substance)</b>
<P>

1	The plaintiff sues the defendant in respect of two broadcasts.
<P>

2	The first publication was on 15 September 1997 and is in the following terms
(as set out in Annexure A):
<P>

	"<i>ALAN JONES:</i>
<P>

	<i>I'll tell you something.  You think league's in trouble.  On Friday night,
the had the best that Sydney grade rugby could offer, with
the exception of the
Manly Club:  the champion club Randwick against a club with a magnificent
history, Gordon, and Eastwood still
trying to win a Premiership, with Warringah
likewise.  What a line-up.</i>
<P>

	<i>How many were there?  7,000.  Why?  Well, why would supporters go when
their best team isn't on the paddock?  All because the ARU
decided that they,
not the players, will determine who plays grade rugby.  Well, the public voted
on Friday night with their feet.</i>
<P>

	<i>John O'Neill, the boss of the ARU, is a failed banker.  If he keeps running
Australian Rugby the way he is, then he's equally going
to destroy the
life-blood of the game, club football.  And wherever you go, that's exactly
what supporters of the game are saying.</i>
<P>

	<i>Now, the appointment of Rod McQueen as the Australian coach has given a
fresh face to the game at a national level.  What is now needs
is a fresh face
administratively.  The players deserve better than the support they got on
Friday night.  The games deserves better
than to be run by ego-trippers like
John O'Neill".</i>
<P>

3	The plaintiff pleads in paragraph 6 of the Statement of Claim (and by reason
of correspondence containing amendments) the following
imputations:
<P>

	<i>"(a)	The plaintiff is a failed banker.</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	The plaintiff is not competent to run the Australian Rugby
Union.</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	As head of the ARU, the plaintiff is taking decisions, driven by his
exaggerated sense of his own abilities, which are likely
to destroy the game of
rugby union.</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	As head of the ARU, the plaintiff is taking decision which are likely
to destroy the game of rugby union in order to gratify
his ego.</i>
<P>

<i>	(e)	The plaintiff as head of the ARU is running so badly that he deserves
to be fired".</i>
<P>

4	The second matter complained of said to have been broadcast on 18 September
199 is in the following terms (as set out in Annexure
B)::
<P>

	<i>"ALAN JONES:</i>
<P>

<i>	I see that the Chief Executive of the Australian Rugby Union, John O'Neill,
has actually released a press statement in the light
of comments I made earlier
this week about the poor attendance at the Grade Rugby Semi-Finals on Friday
night.</i>
<P>

<i>	I've not met one person who disagreed with my points that we let the Grade
Rugby competition deteriorate at the risk of the game,
and the ARU's failure to
allow players themselves to decide their availability is not the way to go.
However, nor is Mr O'Neill's
direction the way to go.</i>
<P>

<i>	I think in the press release he referred to me as "an ill informed
commentator".  With respect, Mr O'Neill, you are a failed banker
with no
experience of the game of rugby at the highest level, or indeed at any level.
And I might say, immodestly, I did actually
once coach a team or two.</i>
<P>

<i>	I think I'm closer to an understanding of what the club scene is about than
Mr O'Neill would ever be.  Mr O'Neill, I've also been
to the club scene as
well.  I know you would have difficulty getting a job again as a banker but if
you keep going this way you will
have difficulty getting any job as an
administrator".</i>
<P>

5	Paragraph 7 of the Statement of Claim pleads the following imputations:
<P>

	<i>"(a)	The plaintiff is a failed banker.</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	The plaintiff has failed so badly as a banker that he would find
difficulty ever getting another job as a banker.</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	The plaintiff is not competent to hold his position as Chief Executive
of the Australian Rugby Union".</i>
<P>

6	The defendant moved the Court for orders in relation to the imputations
founded upon questions of capacity and form and difference
in substance.  I
deferred ruling until I had heard the contents of exhibit A being an audio tape
of the two matters complained of.
 Listening to that tape certainly cleared up
a lot of matters.
<P>

7	It is argued in relation to imputation 6(a) that it is incapable of being
defamatory.  I simply disagree.   The matter complained
of in which the words
are used and the overall tone of the broadcast which includes them, clearly
answer the question of capacity.
<P>

8	As to imputation 6(b), it is argued that it is incapable of being conveyed:
the whole of the broadcast and in particular, the
third paragraph of annexure A
is sufficient to answer the question as to the capacity of the matter to convey
this imputation.  Nor
am I persuaded that this imputation is incapable of being
defamatory.  
<P>

9	Imputation 6(c) and 6(d) do cause a problem:  it is argued that they do not
differ in substance and that there is a want of causal
connection between the
description of Mr O'Neill as a person "<i>driven by his exaggerated sense of
his own abilities</i>" or <i>"his ego</i>" and "<i>decisions likely to destroy
the game of rugby union</i>".  I agree with both propositions and imputations
6(c) and (d) will be struck out.  It will be a matter for the pleader but it
seems
to me that 6(c) goes far to capture that which is sought to be captured
but rewording will overcome the "<i>causal</i>" connection problem.
<P>

10	It is argued that imputation 6(e) is a <i>cri de coeur.  </i>This is
perfectly understandable, in my respectful view.  It is clearly insinuated by
the matter complained of that Mr O'Neill deserves
to be fired.
<P>

11	Accordingly, with respect to the first matter complained of imputations
6(a), (b) and (e) will go to the jury.  Imputations 6(c)
and (d) will be struck
out with leave to replead.
<P>

12	As to the second matter complained of the same considerations apply with
respect to imputation 7(a) as applied to imputation
6(a).  That imputation will
go to the jury.
<P>

13	As to imputation 7(b), I am persuaded that imputation (b) arises and that
the additional quality of the plaintiff as a "<i>failed banker</i>" namely,
disqualification from getting another job in that area, also is clearly
available.  Imputation 7(b) will go to the jury.
<P>

14	As to imputation 7(c), the plaintiff is entitled to rely upon the whole of
the matter complained of:  the message is quite clear
particularly in the last
paragraph as set out in annexure B.  Imputation 7(c) will go to the jury.
<P>

15	The plaintiff by letter dated 12 November 1998 proposed amendments to its
originally pleaded imputations by adding 6(c), 6(d)
and 6(e).  The plaintiff
has failed in respect only of 6(c) and (d).  The area of accommodation reached
between the parties however
is not such, in my view, as to preclude the
plaintiff overall being entitled to his costs of this application.
<P>

16	Accordingly, the formal orders are:
<P>

1.	Imputations 6(a), (b) and (e) will go to the jury.
<P>

2.	Imputations 6(c) and (d) are struck out as not differing in substance and as
being deficient in form, with leave to replead.
<P>

3.	Imputations 7(a), (b) and (c) will go to the jury.
<P>

4.	The plaintiff has leave to file an Amended Statement of Claim within 14
days.
<P>

5.	The defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs.
<P>

6.	The parties have liberty to file, by consent, orders and directions for the
further conduct of the matter in the Defamation List
within 21 days.
<P>

7.	At the expiry of 21 days, liberty to restore to the Defamation List on 3
days notice. 
<P>
