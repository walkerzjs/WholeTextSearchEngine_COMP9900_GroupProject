<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>By Summons filed on 13 July 1999, the
Plaintiff in these proceedings seeks, inter alia:-
<P>

"An order pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 75</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a> ("the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>")
alternatively <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 69</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, alternatively <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 65</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> that
the Second Defendant determine according to law the application by the
Plaintiff pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s48e.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 48E</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a> (as amended) that
the Second Defendant direct the undermentioned witnesses to attend to give oral
evidence at the hearing of committal
proceedings to take place on a date to be
fixed:-
<P>

(i)	Sheree Ann Stenning
<P>

	(ii)	Charles Lucas."
<P>

2   	The Second Defendant, a Magistrate, has filed a submitting
appearance.
<P>

3   	In proceedings previously brought by the First Defendant
against him, Mr Dawson seems to have been charged to the effect that
(the terms
of the charge are not expressed as clearly as they might be in the Affidavit of
Clayton Cross of 28 June 1999):-
<P>

"Between 6 June 1998 and 17 June 1998 at Glenn Innes... he did have sexual
intercourse with Sheree Ann Stenning, being a person
with an intellectual
disability, while Sheree Ann Stenning was in (?under) the authority of the
Plaintiff in connection with a service
run by Janet Wing Dawson for persons
with intellectual disabilities, knowing that Sheree Ann Stenning was a person
with an intellectual
disability."
<P>

4   	On 19 May 1999 the Plaintiff sought a direction pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s48e.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 48E</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a> requiring the attendance at the committal
proceedings in relation to the above charge of the following witnesses:-
<P>

(a)	Sheree Ann Stenning.
<P>

(b)	Charles Lucas
<P>

(c)	Dr Larry Yee
<P>

(d)	Janet Wing Dawson
<P>

(e)	Linda June Dawson.
<P>

5   	On 10 June 1999 the Second Defendant determined that
application and while directing that the last three of the persons named
attend
declined to make a similar order in relation to the first two.
<P>

6   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s48e.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 48E</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a> falls within subdivision
7A.  The operation of subdivisions 7 and 7A have been the subject of
consideration in a number of cases
in this court and it is unnecessary for me
to say more about the scheme of the provisions contained within those
subdivisions beyond
recording that, subject to some qualifications, they
envisage that evidence for the prosecution in committal proceedings shall be
given by means of written statements.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s48e.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 48E</a> provides some exceptions to
this.  So far as is presently relevant the Section provides:-
<P>

"(1)	For the purposes of committal proceedings, the Justice or Justices may
give a direction requiring the attendance at the proceedings
of a person who
has made a written statement for the purposes of this Subdivision.  The
direction may be given on the application
of the defendant or informant or on
the motion of the Justice or Justices.
<P>

(2)	The Justice or Justices may give the direction only if:-
<P>

(a)	in the case of a witness in proceedings that relate to an offence involving
violence who is the alleged victim of the offence
- the Justice or Justices are
of the opinion that there are special reasons why, in the interests of justice,
the witness should
attend to give oral evidence, or
<P>

(b)	in any other case - the Justice or Justices are of the opinion that there
are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice,
the witness should
attend to give oral evidence."
<P>

7   	To appreciate the issues posed for my determination, it is
necessary to set out the case as the Crown proposes to pursue it.
<P>

8   	The complainant has Down's Syndrome.  Although she is about
20, Mr Lucas, a consulting psychologist concluded that her cognitive
capacities
and overall functioning levels are compatible with those typically expected
from individuals at the pre-school to infants
school levels.  In a report dated
1 July 1998 Mr Lucas also said that the Plaintiff displayed, inter alia,
attention seeking behaviour,
emotional volatility and her behaviour was
basically visually driven and that "she tends to respond and react to the
immediate situation
she can actually visualise, rather than a communication
based upon conceptualisation and expression of her needs".  His report also
records that Janet Wing Dawson had related to him that the complainant had been
sexually abused from the age of 10 by various carers.
 Given that Mrs Wing
Dawson only came into contact with the complainant sometime between early 1997
and March 1998 this information,
unless made up by Mrs Dawson, presumably came
from the complainant.  
<P>

9   	The first time the present complaints against Mr Dawson saw
the light of day seems to have been on 17 June 1998 when the complainant
was
staying for a few days with some of Mr Dawson's children, Helga, Linda and Nola
and a flatmate, Justin Newberry.  Sheree was
looking through a section of a
People magazine containing pictures of naked men.  She volunteered "I had sex
with my dad last night".
 Linda said "What are you talking about?" and Sheree
gave further details of a sexual assault.
<P>

10   	Later that night, Helga had further conversation with
Sheree but it is somewhat difficult to decide whether this accords with,
or
throws some doubt on, what she had said earlier.  In answer to a question "Have
you had sex before?" the complainant did say,
"Yes with my other dad.".  
<P>

11   	Linda Dawson in a statement of the same date as that of
her sister Helga, viz. 22 June 1998, reports the complaint in similar
terms,
albeit Linda is uncertain whether the complaint was made on 17 or 18 June.
<P>

12   	Helga had said it was on 18 June and that Mr Dawson had
left Sheree with her on 16 June.  Obviously if these dates are correct
any
sexual assault cannot have occurred "last night".
<P>

13   	Janet Wing Dawson married the Plaintiff in about 1992.
Over the following years they cared for a number of handicapped people
although
their own relationship seems to have been marked by numerous separations and
resumptions of cohabitation.  
<P>

14   	She said that at the end of May 1988, she, Sheree and two
boys moved to Glenn Innes where Mr Dawson had been living for a
couple of
months.  She stayed there until 10 June when she had to return to Nambour.  The
complainant asked if she could stay with
Mr Dawson and did so.  On 16 June, Mr
Dawson went to Nambour to collect Mrs Dawson and the rest of her things.  On 17
June Mr Dawson
had a telephone conversation with Helga following which he
appeared angry and said to Mrs Dawson "that little bitch is saying that
I had
sex with her".  Mrs Dawson asked if there was any truth in this suggestion and
he said no.  
<P>

15   	Mrs Dawson says that on 19 June Helga repeated details of
the incident as she understood it and later that day she confronted
Mr Dawson.
She recounts other conversations with him and, without recounting all of these
in detail asserts that Mr Dawson's responses
moved from:-
<P>

"Look, she was crying and she just came in for a cuddle because she was missing
mum.  Look she had a cuddle and things got out of
hand and I put my hands
between her legs and that's all that happened."
<P>

through:- 
<P>

"Look I told you what happened.  It just got a little bit out of hand."  And a
denial of penetration.
<P>

to the following:-
<P>

"Mrs Dawson:  Before you go to bed, I want to know, did you insert in her?
<P>

Mr Dawson:  No.  I tried to, but she started to cry.
<P>

Mrs Dawson:  You did try then did you?
<P>

Mr Dawson:  Yes.  She was too small, she started to cry.  You or the fucking
cops can't do anything anyway, she consented.
<P>

Mrs Dawson:  Is this going to keep happening?
<P>

Mr Dawson:  If the chemistry's there and she's willing, why not?
<P>

Mrs Dawson:  You rotten bastard."
<P>

16   	This last conversation occurred on 20 June and on the
following day Mrs Dawson took Sheree to the police station and reported
the
matter.
<P>

17   	In the afternoon on 21 June the complainant was examined
by Dr Yee who reported that examination was difficult as the patient
was
reluctant.  There was no evidence of swelling, bruises, lacerations, bleeding
or discharge but no internal examination was done
nor swab taken as the patient
would not allow these.  He records that "the patient was alleged to have been
sexually assaulted by
carer's de facto partner between 10-15 June".
<P>

18   	A statement in the form of questions and answers was taken
from the complainant herself on the morning of 21 June.  The statement
contains, inter alia, the following:-
<P>

Q1  Sheree as I have told you my name is Dave Ryan and I am a police officer.
Do you know what police officers do?
<P>

	A  No
<P>

	Q2  Sheree can you tell me what it is to tell the truth?
<P>

A  Yes I will tell the truth.
<P>

Q3  If I said that Janet's top is black would that be the truth (top is
green).
<P>

	A  No it's green.  That's the truth.
<P>

	Q4  So can you tell me what a lie is?
<P>

A  No
<P>

Q5  If I said there is a big pink elephant in the corner would that be the
truth or would that be a lie?
<P>

	A  The truth.
<P>

	Q6  Sheree can you tell me what happens if someone tells lies?
<P>

A  Get into trouble.
<P>

Q10  Do you know what Janet has brought you here to talk to me about?
<P>

	A  No more sex with Darrell.
<P>

	Q11  Sheree have you had sex with Darrell?
<P>

A  One night.
<P>

Q12  When was that night?
<P>

	A  Last night.
<P>

	Q13  Can you tell me what having sex is?
<P>

	A  It's private.
<P>

	Q14  Can you tell me what you and Darrell did to have sex?
<P>

	A  He hurt me.  He squashed me up.  He touched my private bit.
<P>

	Q15  What is your private bit?
<P>

	A  All my body.
<P>

	Q16  Where on your body did Darrell touch you that hurt you?
<P>

	A  Down here (Sheree places hand on her groin).
<P>

	Q17  When Darrell touched your private bit and it hurt what did he touch you
with?
<P>

	A  his dick.
<P>

Q22  Where were you when Darrell did this to you?
<P>

	A  Where I'm living with Janet and Darrell.
<P>

	Q26  Has Darrell put his dick inside you more than that time?
<P>

A  Yes.
<P>

Q27  Do you know how many times he has put his dick inside you?
<P>

	A  (Shrugs shoulders)  Three hours I cried."
<P>

19   	The effect and operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s48e.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 48E</a> and the meaning to
be given to the expressions "special" and "substantial" in paragraphs 2(a) and
2(b) have been the subject of consideration
in a number of cases in this court.
It is unnecessary for me to canvass these beyond noting the following.  In the
case of paragraph
2(a):-
<P>

"The reasons must be special to the particular case.  There must be some
features of the particular case by reason of which it is
out of the ordinary
and by reason of which it is in the interests of justice that the alleged
victim should be called to give oral
evidence.  It cannot be enough that the
Defendant would be prejudiced if the alleged victim is not called." - <b>B v
Gould &amp; DPP</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2067%20A%20Crim%20R%20297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 67 A Crim R 297</a> at 303.
<P>

20   	Turning to paragraph 2(b), <b>DPP v Losurdo</b>
(unreported, CCA, 23 September 1998) makes clear that the hurdle presented by
"substantial" is not as formidable as that presented
by the word "special";
"substantial" is an ordinary English word and must be given its ordinary
meaning in the context in which it
appears.  The reasons advanced must have
substance in the context of the nature of committal proceedings and the
provisions of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a> relating to them.  It is not necessary to show
that the case is exceptional or unusual.  The application to cross-examine
requires
identification and consideration of the objective of the
cross-examiner, and the framework of the prosecution case. 
<P>

21   	The particular grounds relied on before the Second
Defendant in support of the application that the complainant be called
seem to
have been that -
<P>

(i) The complainant was not a competent witness
<P>

(ii) There is a real possibility that, if she was subject to cross-examination,
the Plaintiff would not be committed, and
<P>

(iii) the complainant has given more that one version of the alleged offence
and those versions are inconsistent.
<P>

22   	In here reasons for refusing the application relating to
the complainant, Her Worship referred to a concession by counsel
appearing for
the First Defendant that if the prosecution was reliant solely on the evidence
of the complainant, the prosecution
probably would not proceed and went on.  (I
repeat Her Worship's remarks as transcribed):-
<P>

"Now in relation to that I accept that an issue relating to the competency of
the alleged victim is a matter for the trial judge
undertaken by a Basha
Inquiry and in relation to that they are of the opinion, having regard to what
has, what evidence there is
before me and what they seek to rely on, is that
there are no special reasons before requiring the direction to be given.  Of
course,
the defence challenged that...  So it is quite clear from the DPP's
point of view that there is some issue in relation to the impact
of her mental
state upon issues concerning competency, but again that it is to be looked at
and examined by the trial judge.
<P>

Just going back to the prosecution case - sorry - not the prosecution case, the
case for the defence in calling the witness.  It
is an issue concerning the
inconsistent complaint evidence.  Previous sexual assaults, ? and access to
pornographic magazines.  Also
she is required in relation to the physical state
of the alleged victim on examination and again inconsistent complaint.  So it
would
seem to me in relation to the actual story that the alleged victim has
given to a number of people, having regard to her mental state,
is that that
demonstrates special reasons in the interests of justice.
<P>

Of course, in relation to both special reasons and substantial reasons in the
interests of justice, the apparent strength or weakness
of a prosecution case
is relevant, particularly where identification is a live issue and it is not an
issue in this case as I see
it...
<P>

So in my view the prosecution hinges upon the complaint evidence, as I have
indicated, and the reliability of the admissions and
as succinctly put in the
DPP case, that if she was to be called alone it is doubtful prosecution would
proceed.
<P>

I am of the view, in relation to this matter, that in relation to the test of
special reasons it has not been made out and in my
view the application for a
direction under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s48e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s48E</a> is to be denied in relation to the alleged victim."
<P>

23   	The first paragraph I have quoted displays clear legal
error.  Sub-sections 41(2) and (6) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a> provides that, in
committal proceedings, the magistrate shall form opinions whether the evidence
before him or her is capable of
satisfying a jury that the defendant has
committed an indictable offence and whether there is a reasonable prospect that
a jury would
convict the defendant.  Relevant to those questions is the
competence of the witnesses and it is not open to a magistrate simply
to ignore
that issue and say it will be looked at by the trial judge.  Sub-section 41(8A)
precludes a magistrate in committal proceedings
from excluding evidence on the
discretionary grounds contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p3.11" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3.11</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>.  Neither
that sub-section nor any other provision, precludes a magistrate, in forming
the opinions to which I have referred, from
taking account of any likelihood -
in some cases, perhaps near certainty - that a trial judge will exercise those
discretions so
as to exclude evidence.  The endorsement by the Court of Appeal
in <b>DPP v Losurdo </b>(at p 15-16) of the remarks of Hidden J (quoted at p
7), the Court's rejection of the argument advanced in reliance on sub-section
41(8A), and the endorsement of the following remarks of Deane J in <b>Grassby v
R</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20168%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 168 CLR 1</a> makes that clear.  Deane J said:-
<P>

"If, for example, a magistrate were of the view that the only incriminating
evidence would clearly be excluded by the trial in the
exercise of a judicial
discretion, he or she would, in my view, necessarily be of the opinion that,
having regard to all the evidence
before him or her, a jury would not be likely
to convict the Defendant of an indictable offence...  A magistrate cannot
intelligibly
address the question whether a jury would not be likely to convict
without deciding, to the best of his or her ability and on the
material before
him or her, what the evidence before the jury would be." 
<P>

24   	Deane J's remarks were made in the context of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices
Act</a> as it stood prior to the amendments made in 1996 coming into force but,
with proper allowance for the current form of the tests to
be applied by
magistrates under sub-sections 41(2) and (8), His Honour's remarks are still
applicable. 
<P>

25   	Nor is a "Basha Inquiry" - see <b>R v Basha</b> (1989) 39
A Crim R 337 - a substitute for the proper conduct of committal proceedings.
The procedure for which that case stands as
authority is commonly employed to
overcome the effect of committal proceedings not having been as complete as
they might have been
but the procedure's availability is not a reason for
magistrates not to fulfil the statutory duties entrusted to them.
<P>

26   	I turn to the application concerning Mr Lucas.  The
reasons advanced in support of being afforded the opportunity of
cross-examining
him were to obtain precise details of the history he was given
and to explore the competency of the complainant.  Most of the Second
Defendant's remarks for rejecting the application to have him called are
contained in the following passage:-
<P>

"Now in relation to Charles Lucas, the DPP in their written submissions, have
indicated that there should be, in relation to him,
that the history of other
unrelated sexual experience would be prohibited by Section 409B and I note the
particular report which
indicates principally her state of mental functioning
and as a result a battery of tests as I understand which would have been
applied
to determine that, her reading and her overall vocabulary and in
relation to that principally in my view deals with her level of
intellectual
disability.
<P>

I am of the view that in relation to the report that substantial reasons in the
interests of justice have not been made out and
in relation to Mr Lucas and the
direction sought pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s48e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s48E</a> is refused in relation to that particular
expert."
<P>

27   	Although Her Worship does not say so, it is to be inferred
that Her Worship saw the matters referred to in the first of these
paragraphs
as the reasons why "substantial reasons in the interests of justice" had not
been made out in relation to Mr Lucas.  However,
it is not possible to divorce
her Worship's reference to the complainant's level of intellectual disability
from the earlier expressed
views concerning the complainant's mental state and
its impact on her competency and that that topic was to be looked at by the
trial
judge.  It is a clear inference that Her Worship's decision concerning Mr
Lucas was affected by the same error as her decision concerning
the
complainant.
<P>

28   	The conclusions at which I have arrived make it
unnecessary for me to consider other possible bases for a challenge to Her
Worship's decision.  However, I should not leave the matter without recording
that there are parts of the reasons delivered which
suffer from a lamentable
lack of clarity.  I shall give but one illustration.  In the extract from Her
Worship's reasons which I
have quoted in paragraph [22] above the following
passages appear:-
<P>

"So it would seem to me in relation to the actual story that the alleged victim
has given to a number of people, having regard to
her mental state, is that
that demonstrates special reasons in the interests of justice." and
<P>

"I am of the view, in relation to this matter, that in relation to the test of
special reasons it has not been made out and in my
view the application for a
direction under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s48e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s48E</a> is to be denied in relation to the alleged victim."
<P>

29   	There is clear inconsistency between these statements.  It
may be that in the first of these passages Her Worship merely intended
to
indicate that problems she saw in the victim's story argued for the existence
of special reasons, an argument overwhelmed by the
matters to which she later
referred but she did not say so.  Some allowance must be made for the fact that
Her Worship's reasons
were delivered <i>ex tempore</i>, but on the assumption
that reasons given reflect what is in the mind of the person delivering them,
inconsistencies of the nature
of that to which I have referred, and lack of
clarity of expression can not but inspire great doubts as to whether issues
have been
properly addressed.
<P>

30   	In this case it is unnecessary to consider the limits or
constraints on the exercise of this Court's powers under the sections
of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> relied on by the Plaintiff, or whether reference should have
been made therein to s134 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a>.  The error was of a nature such
that there has been a constructive failure by Her Worship to exercise the
jurisdiction imposed on
her under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s48e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48E</a> - see <b>Waterhouse v Gilmore</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2012%20NSWLR%20270" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 12 NSWLR 270</a> at 275 et seq. and <b>Saffron v DPP </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2016%20NSWLR%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 16 NSWLR 397</a>
at 414.  Accordingly an order more or less in accordance with that sought by
the Plaintiff should be made.
<P>

31   	Of course, it will remain for Her Worship to make up her
own mind as to whether either or both of the complainant and Mr Lucas
should be
called.  The orders I make are:-
<P>

1. That the Second Defendant determine according to law and in accordance with
these Reasons, the application by the Plaintiff pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s48e.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 48E</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a> (as amended) that the Second Defendant direct the
undermentioned witnesses to attend to give oral evidence at the hearing of
committal
proceedings to take place on a date to be fixed:-
<P>

(i)	Sheree Ann Stenning
<P>

	(ii)	Charles Lucas.
<P>

	2. That the First Defendant pay the Plaintiff's costs of and incidental to
these proceedings.
