<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR  :</b> This is an appeal from the decision of the Master
dismissing the appellants' application for summary dismissal under Part 13 rule
5 of the<i> Supreme Court Rules</i> in proceedings commenced against them by
the respondents for alleged professional negligence.  The alleged negligence
arose in the
conduct of litigation in the Equity division of this Court which
resulted in a judgment by Young J against the plaintiffs (the equity
proceedings).  The plaintiffs had sued on various causes of action having as
their essential ingredient an alleged unauthorised appointment
by the defendant
financier of a receiver who entered into possession of certain of the
plaintiffs' assets.  The relevant instruments
providing for appointment of the
receiver set out a number of events of default, the occurrence of which
permitted the appointment.
 In the equity proceedings, the financier relied on
twelve alleged events of default.  The Court found that ten of these had been
established.  As the occurrence of any one of them could have properly
triggered the appointment of the receiver, it followed that
judgment with costs
was awarded to the financier.  
<P>

2	The disappointed plaintiffs commenced an action in due course against the
solicitors who had acted for them in the equity proceedings,
alleging
professional negligence.  The substance of this action was an allegation that
the solicitors had, or ought to have, been
aware of a body of evidentiary
material which was not adduced in the equity proceedings and which would have
assisted the plaintiffs
materially in establishing their case.  
<P>

3	It was, in effect, conceded before the Master (and before me) that the
postulated evidence was capable of bearing upon six of
the ten events of
default found by Young J to have occurred.  It was submitted by the defendants
to the Master, however, that any
one of the remaining four would have sufficed
to have determined the equity proceedings in their favour.  Accordingly,
whether or
not the defendants had failed properly to present the plaintiffs'
case in the respects alleged, the outcome would have been the same
and there
was no loss.  The Master found and, for the purposes of the proceedings before
me, the defendants conceded, that the omitted
evidence was at least relevant to
two of the remaining four events but argued that this made no significant
difference.
<P>

4	The two unaffected events of default were - 
<P>

	(i)	the plaintiffs did not pay $10,718.26 (Group Tax due under the relevant
legislation) to the Deputy Federal Commissioner of
Taxation due on 7 December
1990;  and
<P>

	(ii)	there was a failure to cause the plaintiffs' books to be audited each
year and to furnish a copy to the financiers.
<P>

5	On the part of the plaintiffs it was not disputed that these occurrences were
events of default under the relevant instruments
but it was submitted that if
they had been able to establish waiver or circumstances constituting an
estoppel they may have succeeded
nevertheless in the equity proceedings.  
<P>

6	In the course of his Honour's judgment, however, Young J said -
<P>

	Perhaps I should say here something which is pertinent to a number of
submissions made by Mr Garnsey for the plaintiffs.  In recent
years
particularly, there has been considerable stress laid by courts on looking to
the intention rather than to the form and this
has involved much more use of
equitable principles, particularly principles involving the law of estoppel,
than heretofore.  Whilst
it is also true that in recent years the old maxim
that estoppels could be used "as a shield but not as a sword" have been cast
aside,
it is still true to say that it is usually easier to employ such a
weapon as a shield rather than as a sword.  
<P>

	If this were a case in which a debtor was seeking some relief against
forfeiture because of some over-technical approach by a creditor
and the debtor
offered to do equity, then it may well be that a rather benign attitude might
be taken to the debtor's situation.
 However, it seems to me a completely
different situation where a debtor sues for substantial damages for trespass or
for unlawful
interference with economic relations.  It is difficult to see how
it can be conscionable to aid a debtor to obtain such substantial
damages by
disregarding the legal rights of the parties and substituting some artificial
equitable obligation.  Indeed, the situations
where equity has permitted
estoppels to be used as a sword appear to be limited to the case of what I have
called in another place
"equitable non-contracts".  That is, in an appropriate
case equity will say that even though at common law there is no contract,
the
parties ought to be estopped from denying the existence of a contract and
equity will grant specific performances of the "non-contract".
 Saying this,
however, is quite a different thing from saying that equity will make up any
deficiencies in a cause of action in tort.
 Indeed, the highest equity has gone
is in the <i>Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20164%20CLR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 164 CLR 387</a>
situation:  where it would be unconscionable not do so, equity has awarded
equitable damages for breach of an equitable non-contract.
<P>

	Accordingly, when one looks at the situation between the parties, due
attention must be paid to estoppels in the contracts, such
as the parties by
their conduct making it clear that payment on the last day of the month would
be sufficient, but must not, for
sympathy for the plaintiffs or otherwise,
supply ingredients in a cause of action, especially a cause of action in tort
for substantial
damages.
<P>

Even so, there was no evidence in the equity proceedings capable of supporting,
let alone establishing, a waiver or an estoppel
nor was Mr Rollinson of
counsel, who appeared for the plaintiffs before me, able to point to any
relevant evidence in the omitted
material.  It was put to me, however, that it
may have been that the exposure of the omitted material might have prompted a
response
from the financiers which might have produced hitherto unavailable
material of an unknown character that might demonstrate the existence
of the
relevant equity.  One only has to state the submission to demonstrate its lack
of persuasive force.  It was not submitted
that discovery in the equity
proceedings was or might have been inadequate, nor that interrogatories may
have yielded material facts:
 <i>cf Wickstead v Browne</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) NSWLR 1</a>, per
Handley and Cripps JJA at 11.  Even the possible unpredictable feature (vide
<i>Rushcutters Investments Pty Ltd</i> v <i>Gillmour</i> unreported NSWCA 17
June 1987) must have some recognizable element capable of assisting the
plaintiffs.  In this regard, the extensive
litigation, including use of
pretrial procedures, in the equity proceedings, provides a substantial
evidentiary context for considering
the application for dismissal which is not
usually available (cf <i>Rushcutters Investments</i>).  In the <i>Commonwealth
v Verwayen</i> (1990) 170 CLR 394, it was pointed out by Deane J (at 444) that
-
<P>

	Since an estoppel will not arise unless the party claiming the benefit of it
has adopted the assumption as the basis of action
or inaction and thereby
placed himself in a position of significant disadvantage if departure from the
assumption be permitted, the
resolution of an issue of estoppel by conduct will
involve an examination of the relevant belief, actions and position of that
party.
<P>

7	Whether or not the plaintiffs relied, in fact, upon any alleged
representation or assumption is a matter, of course, within the
knowledge of
the plaintiffs.  There was no material to which Mr Rollinson could point which
suggested any such reliance.
<P>

8	Accordingly, even if the difficulty posed for the plaintiffs in the passage
which I have quoted above from the judgment of Young
J was not as overwhelming
an obstacle which his Honour's language might suggest (which was not contended
before me), the submission
made in this respect on behalf of the plaintiffs
must fail.  The same arguments seem to me to apply to the second of the events
of
default referred to above.  
<P>

9	In dealing with the four identified events of default, the Master observed
that, as to certain of them "questions of waiver or
estoppel were argued" but,
without giving any explanation as to how such arguments might have been
resolved in favour of the plaintiffs,
declined to grant the defendants'
application upon the basis that "it appeared that there may be other ways [than
those contained
in the pleadings] of presenting their claim open to the
plaintiffs" and that he was "not satisfied that the plaintiffs' claim is
hopeless or bound to fail".
<P>

10	With the greatest respect, I consider that the exiguity of the Master's
reasons constitutes a failure of his duty to expose "not
only the evidence, and
the decision arrived at, but also the reasons for arriving at the decision":
<i>Carlson v King</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281947%29%2064%20WN%20%28NSW%29%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1947) 64 WN (NSW) 65</a> per Jordan CJ at 66;  <i>Soulemezis
v Dudley</i> <i>(Holdings) Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2010%20NSWLR%20247" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 10 NSWLR 247.</a>  
<P>

11	Quite apart from the error, I am unable to appreciate from the Master's
judgment how other possible ways of presenting their
claim open to the
plaintiffs might assist them to overcome the survival of the two events of
default to which I have referred.  Mr
Rollinson was unable in his submissions
to me to assay a recasting of the action that might have this effect.  
<P>

12	It was submitted to me on behalf of the appellants by Mr Hutley SC that of
the other two remaining events of default, at least
that which comprised the
existence of a material adverse change in the financial position of the
borrower could not have been affected
by the postulated additional evidence,
although that evidence may (according to the Master) have in one or other
respects been relevant.
 Mr Rollinson, except in the sense that the additional
evidence referred to this matter, was unable to point to its possible use
either to render the existence of the event doubtful or to support a case of
waiver or estoppel even accepting, in defiance of his
Honour's judgment in this
respect, that such equities might have constituted elements of the plaintiffs'
causes of action in the
equity proceedings.  The crucial evidence is that
contained in the affidavit of a Mr Ian Ballingall sworn 6 December 1993.  The
most
favourable view of this evidence (ignoring any technical inadmissibility)
is that the adverse changes which were objectively demonstrated
might not have
been considered by the relevant officers of the Bank, having regard to the
plaintiffs' history and the entirety of
their financial affairs, as creating a
substantial risk of default in payment of their debts.  However, that was not
the material
issue.  As Young J found (with respect, inevitably) there were
"obviously adverse circumstances affecting the business".
<P>

13	In the result, I consider that the defendants have established that the
plaintiffs' claim, insofar as it rests upon the adverse
judgment on the
substantive actions in the equity proceedings, is hopeless or bound to fail.
However, a substantial area of dispute
in the equity proceedings might have
been affected by the additional evidence and findings in favour of the
plaintiffs in those respects
may have affected the order for costs ultimately
made by his Honour.  As at present drawn, the pleadings in the current
proceedings
do not seem to me to cover this eventuality.  I do not think that
it would be just in all the circumstances to dismiss the plaintiffs'
statement
of claim if by so doing they were precluded from litigating this matter because
of the considerations arising from <i>Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty
Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20147%20CLR%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 147 CLR 589</a>;  and see<i> Ling v Commonwealth</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1996/1646.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] FCA 1646</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2068%20FCR%20180" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 68
FCR 180</a> and <i>Bryant v Commonwealth Bank</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1995/1299.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] FCA 1299</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2057%20FCR%20287" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 57 FCR 287.</a>  Accordingly,
I do not propose by the order which I make to preclude the plaintiffs from
amending their statement of claim appropriately
to permit them to litigate the
question whether, because of the alleged negligence of the defendants, a
different order for costs
may have resulted in the equity proceedings.  Subject
to this qualification, however, I allow the appeal from the Master's judgment
and dismiss the causes of action contained in the statement of claim filed on
10 October 1997.  The respondents must pay the appellants'
costs.
