<b><u>SENTENCE</u></b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  On 24 April, 1998 the prisoner, to whom I shall refer as Chun
Hing Law, following a trial by judge and jury of twelve,
which commenced on 18
March, 1998, was found guilty and convicted on a charge that between about 1
December, 1993 and about 13 January,
1995 at Sydney and elsewhere did conspire
with Joseph Law Ling (Joseph Law), Alan Tam, Mao Huang Tung, Brian Alexander
Kuan and others
to import into Australia not less than the commercial quantity
of heroin in contravention of S 233B(1)(cb) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/" class="autolink_findacts">Customs Act</a></b>, 1901
(Commonwealth).
<P>

2	On 16 March, 1998 the prisoner, Brian Alexander Kuan, pleaded guilty to a
charge that between about 1 December, 1994 and about
13 January, 1995 at Sydney
and elsewhere was knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia of not
less than the commercial
quantity of heroin in contravention of S 233B(1)(d) of
the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/" class="autolink_findacts">Customs Act</a></b>, 1901 (Commonwealth).
<P>

3	On 13 May, 1998 Kevin Chi Ho pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to
possess a prohibited import, namely not less than the
trafficable quantity of
heroin in contravention of S 233B(1)(c) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/" class="autolink_findacts">Customs Act</a></b>, 1901
(Commonwealth).
<P>

4	The prisoners Chun Hing Law and Brian Alexander Kuan are for sentence
today.
<P>

5	On 3 March, 1997Alan Tam Yu Wah (Alan Tam) pleaded guilty to a charge of
conspiring to import not less than the commercial quantity
of heroin and on 10
March, 1997 Mao Huang Tung pleaded guilty to the same charge.
<P>

6	On 23 April, 1997 Yu Tit Hoi, a co-offender of the prisoner Kevin Chi Ho,
pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to possess
a prohibited import, namely
not less than the trafficable quantity of heroin.
<P>

7	On 5 September, 1997 Barr J proceeded to sentence those three offenders, Alan
Tam, Mao Huang Tung and Yu Tit Hoi.
<P>

8	Between January, 1994 and January 1995 there existed a criminal organisation
which had as its objective, multiple importations
of heroin into Australia.
<P>

9	An appreciation of the part played by the two prisoners of their criminality
calls for an examination to some degree of the operation
of the organisation in
question.
<P>

10	The members of the group involved in the importation were predominantly Hong
Kong Chinese, who were resident in Canada, and who
had connections in mainland
China, Hong Kong and Bangkok.
<P>

11	In each of January, July, August and November of 1994 and in January of 1995
goods were consigned from Bangkok to Sydney.  The
procedure adopted regarding
each consignment bore a number of identical features.  The crates containing
the imported goods all emanated
from the same consignor in Bangkok and were
forwarded through the same carrier and the same shipping company.
<P>

12	The same airline was used and the same freight and customs agent in
Sydney.
<P>

13	The cases in which the goods were packed were similar in appearance and the
goods themselves had much in common.  The glass pictures
imported in July and
November 1994 and January 1995, which were described as "glass sculptures" in
which the heroin was concealed,
were virtually identical in appearance.
<P>

14	Prior to each importation an Asian man, not a resident of Australia, arrived
in Sydney and obtained a lease of premises to which
the goods, in due course,
were consigned.
<P>

15	Neither the man who obtained the lease nor anybody else lived in the
premises at any relevant time.
<P>

16	Following the consignments of January, July, August and November 1994
substantial sums of money were transmitted from Sydney
to bank accounts in Hong
Kong and Canada.  Although the total sum transmitted was more than $500,000,
individual sums were always
less than $10,000.  Transmissions of $10,000 or
more are required to be notified to the Australian authorities under the
provisions
of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ftra308/" class="autolink_findacts">Financial Transaction Reports Act</a></b>, 1988.  These
circumstances, together with a large body of other evidence, demonstrate
meticulous care and planning.
<P>

17	Persons involved in these activities during 1994 included Joseph Law, Alan
Tam and the prisoner Chun Hing Law.
<P>

18	Heroin may be taken to have been imported in all the shipments.  Alan Tam
gave evidence to this effect and apart from the facts
attending the importation
of heroin in January 1995, traces of heroin were found in the premises to which
the November 1994 consignment
was delivered.
<P>

19	The persons concerned with the importations had various functions.  One man
would take delivery of the consignments.  He was
the man who entered Australia
and rented the necessary premises.  However, the man concerned never lived in
the premises and by August
1994, the organisation had obtained Unit 86, Waldorf
Apartments, Liverpool Street, Sydney for the accommodation of whoever was
involved
in the importation from time to time.  Other persons concerned had a
role in supervising the importation.  They also would travel
to Sydney from
overseas for the purpose.
<P>

20	Alan Tam became familiar with the modus operandi of the organisation during
1994.  He entered Australia shortly after each of
the importations that
occurred during that year and transmitted money overseas in the manner I have
indicated.  He was responsible
for the transmission of at least $284,000 of the
$540,000 or so that has been detected as having been transmitted.  The sum of
$131,000
went into accounts in Alan Tam's name.  He was in Australia from 19 to
22 March, 26 July to 13 August, 25 August to 22 September
and 25 November to 4
December, 1994.  Although, like Joseph Law, Mao Huang Tung, and the prisoner
Chun Hing Law, he resided in Toronto,
Canada he travelled to Sydney on these
occasions from Bangkok or Hong Kong.  Contact took place during 1994 between
Alan Tam, Joseph
Law and Chun Hing Law by means of a mobile telephone acquired
by Alan Tam.  During his November visit, Alan Tam travelled with Joseph
Law.
Police surveillance of Joseph Law on 5 December, 1994 led to the discovery of
the Waldorf unit.  These premises were originally
rented by Chun Hing Law.
<P>

21	Following a report from a bank officer, police conducted surveillance of
Joseph Law on 5 and 7 December, 1994 and as a result,
identified the Waldorf
apartment.  Police conducted a covert search of this apartment on 13 December
and located a number of items,
including electronic scales, which suggested
that Joseph Law's presence in Australia was related to narcotics.
<P>

22	A listening device installed in the Waldorf apartment alerted police to the
prospect of a further importation of narcotics and
an extensive operation was
mounted by the Australian Federal Police and the New South Wales Police Drug
Enforcement Agency.
<P>

23	The brief facts relating to the 1994 importations are the following:-
<P>

24		On 10 January, 1994 a shipment of seven wooden cases, said to contain
"ceramic dolls and vases" was consigned from Zega Trans
Ship Co Ltd, Bangkok
("Zega") to "Mr Joseph Law, Unit 30, 1-19 Allen Street, Ultimo, Sydney,
Australia".  
<P>

25	The shipment arrived in Sydney on 12 January, 1994 on an Olympic Airways
flight from Bangkok.
<P>

26	Joseph Law arrived in Sydney on 30 December, 1993 and had electricity
connected to the Allen Street unit in his name. 
<P>

27	The consignment was delivered to the Allen Street unit on 17 January,
1994.
<P>

28	On 8, 9 and 10 February, 1994, Joseph Law telegraphically transferred a
total of $25,256.00 to accounts in Canada.  He left Australia
on 14 February,
1994.
<P>

29	In 1994 Chun Hing Law and Joseph Law were in Sydney from 8 April to 22
April.  While in Sydney, Chun Hing Law applied to rent
a unit at 47/344
Bulwarra Road, Ultimo and signed the lease documents on 21 April, 1994.  He
gave as his current address "30/1-19
Allen Street, Ultimo".  
<P>

30	Between 19 and 21 April, 1994 Chun Hing Law and Joseph Law telegraphically
transferred $36,529 to accounts in Hong Kong and Canada.
<P>

31	On 8 July, 1994 a shipment of three wooden crates, said to contain "glass
sculptures", was consigned by Zega in Bangkok to "Mr
Chun Hing Law, 47/344
Bulwarra Road, Ultimo, Sydney, Australia".  These crates arrived in Sydney on 9
July, 1994 on an Olympic Airways
flight from Bangkok.
<P>

32	The items in this shipment were examined by customs officers who found that
a cardboard backing to the pictures, when removed,
revealed a rough textured
sandpaper-like surface.  Scrapings from this surface, taken by customs officers
and tested, did not disclose
narcotics.  The sandpaper surface was not lifted
or removed.  These pictures were identical in nature to those imported in
January
1995 addressed to Brian Kuan.
<P>

33	The evidence of Alan Tam, together with the overwhelming inference to be
drawn, makes clear that the July consignment contained
heroin.
<P>

34	Alan Tam gave evidence that he was recruited into the group in early 1994
and subsequently recruited Chun Hing Law to be the
consignee for importations
containing heroin once he, that is to say Alan Tam, had made the decision to no
longer involve himself
in the direct handling of the imported narcotics.
<P>

35	Chun Hing Law arrived in Sydney on 11 July, 1994 and on that same day,
arranged for electricity to be connected to the Bulwarra
Road, Ultimo premises,
which he had leased during the prior visit by him in April.  The crates were
collected from Ansett by Chun
Hing Law on 14 July, 1994.
<P>

36	Two days later, on 16 July, 1994, Joseph Law arrived in Sydney and stayed
until 23 July.  Alan Tam arrived in Australia on 26
July, 1994.  Between 2
August and 11 August, 1994 Alan Tam and Chun Hing Law telegraphically
transferred a total of $56,711.00 to
bank accounts in Hong Kong and Canada.
Alan Tam left Australia on 13 August, 1994.
<P>

37	On 12 August, 1994 Chun Hing Law rented Unit 86, in the Waldorf Apartments,
to which I have previously referred.  He used the
name "Andy Law" on the lease
documents and had a telephone connected to the unit in that name.
<P>

38	On 15 August, 1994 a shipment of two wooden crates said to contain "glass
sculptures" was consigned by Zega in Bangkok to "Mr
Chun Hing Law, 47/344
Bulwarra Road, Ultimo".  The shipment arrived in Sydney on 17 August, 1994 on
an Olympic Airways flight from
Bangkok.  The two crates were delivered to Chun
Hing Law at the Bulwarra Road address on 23 August, 1994.
<P>

39	Alan Tam arrived in Sydney on 25 August, 1994.  Between 23 August and 20
September, 1994, Alan Tam and Chun Hing Law telegraphically
transferred to Hong
Kong or purchased overseas drafts totalling $107,299.99.
<P>

40	On 2 September, 1994 Alan Tam subscribed to a mobile telephone service, the
records of which disclose that this mobile phone
was used extensively during
September, 1994 as a contact point with the mobile phone and the mobile
telephone service purchased and
subscribed to respectively by Chun Hing Law on
25 July, 1994.
<P>

41	Chun Hing Law left Australia on 18 September, 1994 and Alan Tam left
Australia four days later on 22 September.
<P>

42	On 4 October, 1994 Joseph Law arrived in Australia, remaining only two days
during which he telegraphically transferred $35,812.11
to accounts in Hong
Kong.
<P>

43	Regarding the November, 1994 importation, Chun Hing Law returned to Sydney
on 11 October and remained until 17 October, 1994.
<P>

44	During this time he rented premises at 4/183 Bridge Road, Glebe and paid two
months rent in advance.  He returned to Australia
once more on 13 November,
1994 and arranged for electricity and the telephone to be connected to these
Bridge Road Glebe premises.
<P>

45	On 10 November, 1994 a shipment of two wooden crates, said to contain "13
glass sculptures" was consigned by Zega in Bangkok
to Chun Hing Law at the
Bridge Road, Glebe premises giving as the contact telephone number the mobile
telephone service subscribed
to by Chun Hing Law on 25 July, 1994.  The
shipment arrived in Sydney on 12 November, 1994.
<P>

46	This shipment was once again inspected by customs officers, who noted that
the goods were relatively identical to the pictures
imported in July, 1994, and
those subsequently imported in January, 1995.  The testing of scrapings from
the sandpaper backing conducted
by customs officers was once again negative.
<P>

47	That this shipment contained heroin was not only the subject of direct
evidence by Alan Tam, but was also supported by the fact
that in January 1995,
following the arrest of Alan Tam, Mao Huang Tung, Brian Alexander Kuan, Yu Tit
Hoi and Kevin Chi Ho, police
examination of the premises 4/183 Bridge Road,
Glebe disclosed the crates which had been broken open, together with glass
pictures
from which the backings had been removed, and upon which signs of the
carbon paper which had been wrapped around the secreted packages
were clearly
visible.  Scientific analysis of dust found in a vacuum cleaner on the
premises, dust vacuumed from the carpet by police,
and tracings found in
plastic bags at the premises indicated the presence of heroin.  These crates
were delivered to Chun Hing Law
at the Glebe unit on 18 November, 1994.
<P>

48	Alan Tam and Joseph Law also arrived in Sydney on 25 November, 1994.
Between 28 November and 5 December, 1994 Alan Tam and Joseph
Law
telegraphically transferred money to Hong Kong and Canada and purchased
overseas drafts to a total of $276,694.58.
<P>

49	Chun Hing Law left Australia on 28 November, 1994.  Alan Tam left Australia
six days later on 4 December.
<P>

50	Chun Hing Law attempted to acquire a further visa to permit him to return to
Sydney in January, 1995.  He experienced difficulties
with law enforcement
authorities in Hong Kong and in late December, 1994, his visa application was
refused.
<P>

51	The onset of criminal legal proceedings against Chun Hing Law in Hong Kong
may be accepted as having cast doubt in December 1994
upon his ability to
travel to Australia in January 1995 to fulfil the role of consignee for that
importation.
<P>

52	Alan Tam gave evidence, which I accept, of having been told by Joseph Law to
find another person to take delivery in January
1995 in case Chun Hing Law was
unable to do so.
<P>

53	Brian Kuan obtained a Canadian passport on 15 December, 1994.  On 22
December, 1994 he applied for a visa to travel to Australia.
<P>

54	On 30 December, 1994 Chun Hing Law's application for a visa to visit
Australia was rejected.  On that same day, travel arrangements
were made for
Brian Kuan to travel to Australia.
<P>

55	Alan Tam gave evidence of having recruited Mao Huang Tung to assist in
relation to the January, 1995 importation following the
searching of Joseph Law
by Hong Kong police authorities and his consequential decision not to return to
Australia.  Alan Tam gave
further evidence that it was Mao Huang Tung who
recruited Brian Kuan to be the consignee and "hands-on" functionary to receive
the
January 1995 importation.
<P>

56	On 31 December, 1994 both Alan Tam and Mao Huang Tung arrived in Australia
on the same flight.  On 4 January, 1995 Brian Kuan
arrived in Sydney on a
flight which originated in Canada.  He was met at the airport by Mao Huang
Tung.  At 10 am on the morning
of his arrival, Brian Kuan attended a real
estate agency and was invited to inspect the premises at 601 Harris Street,
Ultimo which
he did.  He completed an application form for the lease of these
premises, giving as his address 1416 Golden Gate Hotel, being the
room booked
by Mao Huang Tung on 3 January, 1995 for a period of ten nights commencing on
that day.
<P>

57	On the day of his arrival, that is to say 4 January, 1995, Brian Kuan also
rented a pager from the ABC Paging Company, which
was the same organisation
from which Joseph Law and Chun Hing Law had each rented pagers during 1994.
Mao Huang Tung and Alan Tam
also utilised a pager from the ABC Paging Company
during January 1995.
<P>

58	On 5 January, 1995 Brian Kuan signed the lease for 601 Harris Street and
paid $1,675.00 in cash, being for the bond, two weeks
rent in advance and the
lease preparation fee.
<P>

59	Between 6 and 9 January 1995, Brian Kuan was observed to meet with Alan Tam
and Mao Huang Tung on a large number of occasions.
<P>

60	On 7 January, 1995 an invoice was prepared by Zega in Bangkok for "29 glass
sculptures" which were consigned to "Mr Brian Kuan,
601 Harris Street, Ultimo,
Sydney, NSW, 2001, Australia".  This consignment, which consisted of four
wooden crates, was shipped to
Australia on 10 January, 1995.
<P>

61	The consignment arrived in Australia on 11 January and was intercepted by
police and customs officers, who opened one of the
crates, removed a glass
picture, together with the cardboard backing and rough sandpaper backing, to
disclose packages of heroin
wrapped in carbon paper.
<P>

62	During the evening of 11 and morning of 12 January, all twenty nine glass
paintings, which were contained in the four crates,
were opened and the heroin
removed and replaced with an inert substance of similar appearance.  The
pictures were reinstated with
a 30 gram control delivery sample of heroin being
placed in one picture in each crate.  The white powder which was removed was
subjected
to scientific analysis and found to be impure heroin hydrochloride
containing an average of 71.7% heroin.  The total weight of the
impure heroin
hydrochloride was 55.9 kilograms.  The total weight of pure heroin was 40.1
kilograms.
<P>

63	A controlled delivery of the four crates was made by a police officer posing
as a courier to 601 Harris Street where Brian Kuan
took delivery, assisted the
courier driver to transport the crates into the premises and paid the sum of
$2,450 to the police officer
posing as the courier for delivery fees and
clearance charges.
<P>

64	Throughout the evening of the 12th and the early morning of 13th January,
1995 Brian Kuan removed the white powder from the reconstituted
pictures and
repackaged that powder into plastic sandwich bags.  His conduct was monitored
by a listening device secreted within
the crates.  During this process Brian
Kuan was telephoned by Mao Huang Tung and that conversation was also
monitored.
<P>

65	At about 4.15 am on the morning of 13 January, Brian Kuan returned from 601
Harris Street to Room 1721 at the Golden Gate Hotel,
which he had checked into
for two nights on 12 January.
<P>

66	On 13 January, 1995 Yu Tit Hoi and Kevin Chi Ho flew from Melbourne to
Sydney, arriving at about 2 pm.
<P>

67	At about 4 pm on 13 January, Mao Huang Tung instructed Brian Kuan to bring
fifteen bags of heroin to Room 1710 of the Golden
Gate Hotel and gave him
directions about handing over what he believed to be heroin to Yu Tit Hoi and
Kevin Chi Ho.
<P>

68	That same afternoon, Kevin Chi Ho booked into the Golden Gate Hotel, using
the name Kevin Lee, and specifically requested a room
on the seventeenth floor.
 He was allocated Room 1721, which is directly across the corridor from Room
1710.
<P>

69	Brian Kuan was observed to leave Room 1710 at 4.20 pm and go first to 601
Harris Street and then to the Waldorf Apartments carrying
a black backpack.
Shortly after 5 pm Brian Kuan was observed to leave the Waldorf Apartments
carrying the same backpack and a grey
soft-sided suitcase.  He returned to Room
1710 at the Golden Gate Hotel.
<P>

70	Following the arrests of Brian Kuan, Mao Huang Tung and Alan Tam the grey
soft-sided suitcase was located in Room 1710 of the
Golden Gate Hotel and in it
were thirteen bags of white powder (being the powder substituted by police).
Two identical bags of white
powder were seized when Yu Tit Hoi and Kevin Chi Ho
were later arrested - making up the fifteen bags which had been the subject of
discussion between Mao Huang Tung and Brian Kuan.
<P>

71	I am satisfied that some time between 5 pm and 6 pm on 13 January Brian Kuan
handed over fifteen bags of white powder, which
he believed to be heroin, to
either Kevin Chi Ho or Yu Tit Hoi; that there was a problem with the white
powder which had been handed
over; that as a result Brian Kuan received back
thirteen of the bags handed over by him and these thirteen bags were ultimately
recovered
by police in the grey suitcase in Room 1710.  These events are
confirmed in the statement made by Alan Tam.
<P>

72	I am satisfied to the requisite standard, on the evidence as a whole, that
had Chun Hing Law been able to obtain a further visa
he would have returned to
Australia to carry out the functions of consignee of the January 1995
importation of heroin using the established
modus operandi followed in the 1994
importations and repeated in January of 1995.  I am further satisfied that he
would have engaged
in the transmission of moneys obtained from the sale of
heroin to overseas destinations.
<P>

73	I am further satisfied that the participation of Chun Hing Law in the period
after the January 1994 importation was at a senior
level within the
organisation when he was largely unsupervised and fulfilling a critical and
central role in the overall conspiracy
up until the time when he was unable to
once again obtain entry into Australia in late December, 1994.
<P>

74	The multiple importations of heroin and the amount of money which the
prisoner Chun Hing Law participated in transmitting out
of Australia during
1994, together with the volume of the importation in January 1995, in which I
am satisfied he conspired, being
in excess of 40 kilograms of heroin of a
wholesale value in excess of ten million dollars, make it plain that the heroin
trafficking
in which the prisoner Chun Hing Law played a vital role must
properly be regarded - as must his criminality - as falling within the
most
serious class of case.
<P>

75	Subjectively the prisoner is aged forty years, having been born on 26.7.58.
Very little subjective material by way of exhibits
or submissions has been put
before the court.  The submission is made, on behalf of the prisoner Chun Hing
Law, that he is a Canadian
National of Hong Kong-Chinese origin, a factor which
will tend to isolate him whilst in custody.  He apparently formed a romantic
liaison with a woman in Australia and his family circumstances were not the
subject of evidence or submissions by counsel.
<P>

76	The criminal antecedents of the prisoner, Chun Hing Law, are of minor
significance and I ignore this aspect as a relevant consideration.
<P>

77	Nevertheless, as has been said many times in this and other courts, good
character is of less significance for serious drug offenders
than in most other
criminal offences.
<P>

78	The principal submission made is that the degree of culpability of Chun Hing
Law is less than that of Alan Tam - counsel eschewed
comparison with Mao Huang
Tung.
<P>

79	Alan Tam and Mao Huang Tung were sentenced on the basis of the conspiracy to
import the single consignment of heroin in January
1995.  Their criminality was
assessed as falling within the most serious class of case by Barr J, warranting
imposition of the maximum
sentence.  With this assessment, I respectfully
agree.
<P>

80	Chun Hing Law's motive was self enrichment.  The importation of what can
only be described as massive amounts of heroin over
the course of that period
of the conspiracy in which he was a participant, leads only to the infliction
of misery and death and the
wide-spread perpetration of crime upon this
community.
<P>

81	The equality of ranking, which Barr J found to prevail between Alan Tam and
Mao Huang Tung, in my view, extends equally to Chun
Hing Law.
<P>

82	I take into account the matters which S 16A of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> of the
Commonwealth</b> makes mandatory.
<P>

83	The maximum penalty for the offence, of which the prisoner Chun Hing Law has
been convicted, is imprisonment for life.  Notwithstanding
the other matters to
be taken into account under the section, the need to punish Chun Hing Law and
to deter others is the overwhelming
consideration which persuades me of the
appropriateness of the maximum sentence.
<P>

84	The sentences which were imposed on the co-offenders Mao Huang Tung and Alan
Tam by Barr J on 5 September 1997 were assessed
in the light of precedent, then
binding on this court, regarding S 16G of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> of the
Commonwealth</b>, which was then considered applicable to adjust a life
sentence imposed in a state such as New South Wales where a remissions system
no longer exists.  The sentence imposed upon Mao Huang Tung and Alan Tam were
adjusted accordingly.
<P>

85	On 7 November, 1997 the High Court of Australia in <b>Vanit -v- R</b> <b>-
Tansakun -v- R - </b>and <b>Wangsaimas -v- R</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/51.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=149%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">149 ALR 1</a>; held that S 16G
does not apply to life sentences for Federal offences where sentences are to be
served in a State or Territory in
which "sentences are not subject to remission
or reduction".  Accordingly, no such adjustment may be availed of in the
present case.
<P>

86	Chun Hing Law, on the charge of conspiracy to import into Australia a
quantity of heroin, being not less than the commercial
quantity, of which you
have been convicted, you are sentenced to imprisonment for life.
<P>

87	The length of your sentence will not be reduced by any remissions because
this State no longer has a remissions system.  Your
sentence will accordingly
be for the term of your natural life.
<P>

88	The plea of guilty by the prisoner Brian Alexander Kuan to the charge of
being knowingly concerned in the importation of heroin
in contravention of S
233B(1)(d) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/" class="autolink_findacts">Customs Act</a></b> of the Commonwealth was entered on 16
March, 1998, which was the first day of his trial on that charge.
<P>

89	In early 1997 the prisoner had faced trial on a charge of conspiring to
import a commercial quantity of heroin in contravention
of S 233B(1)(cd) of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1901124/" class="autolink_findacts">Customs Act</a></b>.  On 10 April, 1997 the jury was unable to reach a verdict
and the prisoner was remanded for retrial.  Other trial proceedings, during
which other co-accused had entered pleas of guilty resulting in the trial being
aborted, do not have significant bearing.
<P>

90	The prisoner's plea of guilty, although made in the face of a powerful Crown
case in which the prisoner was "caught red handed"
entitles him to some
leniency, both as to the prisoner's contrition and to some degree, as to the
utilitarian aspects in determining
the appropriate sentence for the offence
charged to which the prisoner has pleaded guilty and which carries a maximum
penalty of
life imprisonment.
<P>

91	Regarding the prisoner's indications of contrition, I note also the matters
referred to in Exhibit "D", the affidavit of Gabrielle
Ann Drennan, sworn 19
October, 1998, in which reference is made to evidence given by the prisoner at
his earlier trial of being prepared
to plead guilty on indictment to a charge
of possessing or supply heroin, but that such an option, in my view quite
rightly, was
not available to him.  Nevertheless, some indication of contrition
at that stage was evident.
<P>

92	In addition to concerning himself in the steps taken preparatory to
receiving the consignment by obtaining the lease of the premises,
and the
equipment which enabled him to communicate with other co-offenders, the
prisoner carried out the important task of actually
breaking open the
consignment, removing what he believed to be heroin, and weighing and
repackaging it.
<P>

93	The prisoner thereafter manifested his involvement in the venture by
physically transporting the repackaged material, in compliance
with
instructions received from Mao Huang Tung, fifteen bags of the substance to the
Golden Gate Hotel where he had specifically
rented a room for the apparent
purpose of effecting distribution of at least some of the substance he believed
to be heroin.
<P>

94	The prisoner's role and function permitted those of more apparent seniority,
to distance themselves from the suspected narcotics
by virtue of the placement
of the prisoner in the front line.
<P>

95	I have appropriately been referred to what was said by Hunt CJ at CL in <b>R
-v- Raz</b> (unreported - NSWCCA - 17.12.92) where it is said:-
<P>

		"It is always relevant in the sentencing process to know where a person
guilty of importing drugs into Australia, or being knowingly
concerned in their
importation, stands in relation to the organisation for which he commits that
offence.  He may have been recruited
either here or overseas to bring the drugs
into Australia for reward on one occasion only, and to hand them over to
someone here.
  Such a person is the "bare or mere courier" and that is one end
of the spectrum of culpability.  At the other end is the principal
of the
organisation, or other senior person, who recruited the courier or who
organised a supply of the drugs overseas or the distribution
locally".  (At pp
6-7)
<P>

96	In the present case, it is clear beyond question, and the Crown
acknowledges, that the prisoner Brian Alexander Kuan received
supervision and
direction at every step along the way in the performance of the role which he
undertook.   Nevertheless, it is equally
clear and I am satisfied to the
relevant standard that he was far removed from a mere courier and that whilst
clearly of less seniority
and responsibility than those directing him, that is
to say Mao Huang Tung and Alan Tam, the prisoner's function was critical to
the
success of the enterprise associated with the very large importation of heroin
into Australia in January of 1995.
<P>

97	The selection of the prisoner whose appearance, standing and antecedents
would be unlikely to attract suspicion is the rule rather
than the exception in
the selection process of persons chosen to carry out the "hands-on"
function.
<P>

98	The need to administer appropriate punishment, and in particular to send the
clearest possible signal to those who contemplate
the importation of prohibited
narcotics, of which heroin ranks at the highest level with its calamitous and
tragic consequences to
members of the community and in particular the young
members of the community, that their endeavours will be met with the most
condign
punishment is, as I have previously indicated in these remarks, the
overwhelming consideration.
<P>

99	The approach to be adopted by the court in dealing with serious drug
importations and in the formulation of appropriate sentences
has been
adumbrated in the authorities to which I have been referred including
<b>Muanchunkingkan</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2052%20A%20Crim%20R%20354" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 52 A Crim R 354</a> at 356 per Wood J (as he then
was) and the observations of Wells J in <b>Le Cerf</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%208%20ALR%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 8 ALR 349</a> and
also per Wood CJ at CL in <b>Budiman</b> (NSWSC - 8.9.98 - unreported) and also
in <b>Trina La Shae Smith</b> (NSWCCA - 20.8.98 - unreported) and more recently
by Spigelman CJ in <b>Behar</b> (NSWCCA - 14.10.98 - unreported).
<P>

100	The thrust of these authorities is that without the willing help and
co-operation of those who might be described as the couriers
or "hands-on
functionaries" the operation of the nefarious trade of the entrepreneur and his
organisation would fall to the ground
as described by Wells J in <b>Le Cerf</b>
in the oft quoted passage at p 351:-
<P>

	"If there were no middle men and underlings, there would be no men at the top
in an organisation.  If an organisation is starved
of recruits it must
collapse".
<P>

101	The Crown contends that the prisoner has demonstrated little contrition.
Having initially elected to exercise his right to silence,
he volunteered a
detailed explanation in a record of interview in early March 1997, during the
course of the proceedings which were
then on foot against him and others.
Emphasis is placed upon the significance of the fact that that explanation was
advanced at a
time when Alan Tam had pleaded guilty, but the co-accused Mao
Huang Tung was adhering to a plea of not guilty.
<P>

102	I will not embark upon detailed examination of the evidence given by the
prisoner in the trial before Justice Barr.  It is clear
beyond question that
the prisoner was prepared to shape his evidence to suit the circumstances
prevailing at the relevant time and
that in describing his state of knowledge
as to the contents of the backing to the glass pictures which he was unpacking
being heroin,
his evidence was patently disingenuous.   Only after prolonged
and penetrating cross examination was he compelled to concede that
much of the
evidence he had given was simply incredible.
<P>

103	In his evidence before me, the prisoner admitted that sworn testimony given
by him before Barr J was not the truth.
<P>

104	Subjectively, the prisoner is aged twenty three years.  He was aged
nineteen years when he embarked upon the activities which
bring him before the
court today.
<P>

105	The prisoner is a Canadian National of Chinese ethnic origin, who was
attending university in Canada.  He enjoys very strong
family support, both his
parents having travelled to Australia to offer him support since his
incarceration here.  His father has
come to Australia on three occasions to
support his son.  The prisoner has no criminal antecedents and, for obvious
reasons, made
no financial gain from the criminal enterprise in which he was
involved in January of 1995.  He has been in custody since his arrest
on 13
January of that year.
<P>

106	In his evidence the prisoner made reference to the apprehension he felt
concerning the safety of the members of his family and
Mr Brewer of counsel
appearing for him, recognises the difficulty the court has in seeking to gauge
the extent of any such threats
or duress.  The prisoner's father gave evidence
that there had been police activity in Canada relating to certain persons
associated
with drug offences, unrelated to the matters presently before this
court.
<P>

107	I have previously referred to the sequence of events relating to the plea
of guilty and the prisoner's attitude to alternative
pleas, and I take those
matters into account.
<P>

108	The role of the prisoner in the importation in question has variously been
described as that of a "boy"; a "mule"; a "foot soldier"
and by his counsel as
"cannon fodder".   There is no doubt a certain amount of force in the
impression there sought to be conveyed.
 Certainly I accept that the prisoner
was the subject of direct control and direction by others who occupied a far
more senior position
in the hierarchy of the organisation.
<P>

109	I am, however, nevertheless satisfied that his participation in the
enterprise was a voluntary one on his part and that he was
fully aware of what
he was doing at the time.
<P>

110	The comprehensive surveillance which was undertaken by police, once they
became aware of the proposed importation of heroin
on 15 January, 1995, leaves
no doubt that every person associated with this enterprise was identified and
subjected to surveillance.
 The fiction persisted in by the prisoner of the
existence of a mysterious "third man" exhibits a persisting disingenuousness on
the part of the prisoner.
<P>

111	I note that in cross examination, Mr Kuan senior when asked about the
concern he had about persons associated with drug crime
in Canada conceded that
there was nothing in those matters in Canada that had anything to do with
Australia.
<P>

112	I note that during the course of his time in custody, the prisoner has
applied himself to a number of beneficial courses and
other activities and that
in this regard, he indicates prospects of rehabilitation and progress.
<P>

113	I take into account the matters which S 16A of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a></b> of the
Commonwealth requires; the seriousness of the offence and the other relevant
objective and subjective matters.
<P>

114	I consider a sentence of 18 years imprisonment to be appropriate.
<P>

115	This is a sentence to which S 16G of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a></b> applies.  To
take account of the absence of remissions in New South Wales, I reduce the head
sentence to 12 years.
<P>

116	In determining a non parole period, I take into account the subjective case
presented and in particular the prisoner's youth
and prospects of
rehabilitation.  I fix a non parole period of 7 years.
<P>

117	<b>Brian Alexander Kuan</b> I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 12
years, commencing on 13 January, 1995 and I fix a non parole period of 7 years
commencing
on the same day.
<P>

118	The length of your sentence will not be reduced by remissions, because this
state no longer has a remissions system, but in
order to allow for the absence
of remissions, I have reduced the period which would otherwise have been
appropriate.
<P>

119	You will serve the whole of the non parole period of 7 years, commencing on
13 January, 1995 in prison, but if a parole order
is made there will be a
period of service in the community, called the parole period, to complete your
service of the sentence.
<P>

120	If a parole order is made, it will be subject to conditions, and you must
comply with them until you have completed the service
of your sentence.  If you
misbehave whilst on parole or fail to comply with any of the conditions
imposed, your parole may be revoked
and you will then be returned to custody to
serve the remainder of your sentence in prison.
