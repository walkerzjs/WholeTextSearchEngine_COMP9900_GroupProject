<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	By summons dated 12 July 1998, the plaintiff sought a declaration that the
first named defendant, a magistrate sitting in the
Local Court at Parramatta,
had jurisdiction sitting as a court under s.6 of the Local Court (Civil Claims)
Act (the Act) to hear
and determine, pursuant to s.12(1) of that Act, an action
brought in that court by the plaintiff against the second defendant, Le
Tan
Thanh, and also sought consequential orders. In addition to the claim for a
declaration, orders were sought quashing the decision
that the defendant did
not have jurisdiction to determine the claim, to require the defendant to hear
and determine the proceedings
according to law and further consequential
orders, that is, orders in the nature of certiorari and mandamus as provided
for in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.69</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> or alternatively to the latter an order
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.65</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a>.
<P>

2	The action in the Local Court was one in which the plaintiff, by the
pleadings in his statement of claim, sought judgment for
a sum for contribution
as and between himself and the second defendant for one-half of monies alleged
to have been paid by the plaintiff
in satisfaction of certain guarantees given
by the plaintiff and the second defendant jointly to a bank in support of a
company's
indebtedness which indebtedness the plaintiff asserted in his
pleadings he had thus discharged.  The plaintiff also claimed interest
and
costs.
<P>

3	On 3 December 1997, when the matter came before him, the learned magistrate
held there was no jurisdiction under the Act to hear
and determine the
plaintiff's claim and ordered the plaintiff to pay the defendant's professional
costs in the sum of $300.
<P>

4	In response to the statement of claim, the second defendant had filed a
defence in which it stated that the defendant did not
admit that any monies
paid by the plaintiff to the bank were paid in respect of any liability the
subject of the guarantees referred
to, asserting an estoppel by reason that the
subject of the claim was not raised in certain complex proceedings in the
Equity Division
of this court, and further asserting a bar under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation
Act 1969</a>.
<P>

5	The plaintiff's pleading did not expressly define the nature of the
contribution sought and in particular whether it arose by
way of express
agreement or at law or in equity.  The certificate of judgment in evidence does
not disclose that the magistrate gave
any judgment or made any order as
contemplated by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/index.html#p4" class="autolink_findacts">Part 4</a> Division 4 of the Act other than the order for costs, an
order which the court was expressly empowered to make under Division 5,
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(1)(b)</a> of the Act.
<P>

6	It is regrettable that we do not have the reasons of the learned magistrate.
No reasons for judgment or transcript of the magistrate's
decision was tendered
in evidence before me.  However, there was tendered, without objection, a
letter from counsel appearing for
the plaintiff, to the instructing solicitor,
which recorded that the submissions of counsel for the second defendant when
appearing
before the learned magistrate, that the Local Court had no
jurisdiction to consider the claim because the claim sought equitable
relief
and the Local Court had no equitable jurisdiction, had succeeded,
notwithstanding the submission put by the plaintiff's counsel
(ie, that
although the right of contribution between co-guarantors was subject to
equitable principles, when the guarantee had been
paid in full the right of
contribution created a debt, and that debt was recoverable under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.12</a> of the
Act).  The submission was that in the events that had occurred the plaintiff
was suing for a debt at common law.  That letter
records the magistrate as
having accepted the submissions of counsel for the (second) defendant and
"accordingly he (the magistrate)
indicated that he would mark the papers 'no
jurisdiction' and order the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs of $300".
It is on
the parties' concessions that letter and the certificate of judgment I
have drawn to ascertain the basis for the magistrate's conclusion.
<P>

7	Here, the plaintiff contends the magistrate fell into jurisdictional error
and maintains the submission made below, that is, that
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.12</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">19</a> of the Act
do not result, in their proper construction, in denying to the court the
ability to recognise a right which, even if it
had its historical origins in
equitable principles, nonetheless in modern times, it is submitted, is
enforceable in an action for
debt, indeed on a common money count, when the
co-guarantor claiming contribution has paid more than his just proportion of
the principal
debt.
<P>

8	To that submission, the second named defendant (the first named defendant
having appeared and submitted to such order as the court
might make except as
to costs) responded by asserting (1) there was no error since the jurisdiction
was so narrow as not to permit
such an action, where, as here, the action
relies on contribution by implication of law rather than by express agreement;
(2) that
in any event, the proceedings in this court should not result in the
matter being returned to the magistrate since, before him, the
proceedings
could not, in any event, succeed as the defendant was entitled to a stay on a
basis on which he had sought it below and
on which he had defended the
proceedings, ie. by reason of the estoppel pleaded as referred to above.  The
estoppel was said to arise
in the circumstances to which I have referred by
application of the doctrine in <b>Anschun Pty. Limited v. Port of Melbourne
Authority</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20147%20CLR%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 147 CLR 589</a>;  (3) it was urged that there had been
disqualifying delay in the institution of these proceedings;  and (4) that
relief if otherwise
available should be declined as there was an alternative
remedy by way of appeal under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.69</a> of the Act of which the plaintiff had failed
to seek.  It was said that particularly by reference to the time limit of some
35 days
for the instituting of such an appeal, the delay in the institution of
the present proceedings was such that on that ground alone
or in combination
with the contended availability of the appeal, the court would in its
discretion decline to grant the declaration
or make the orders sought.
<P>

9	On the issue of delay, the affidavit of the plaintiff sworn 7 July 1998 and
that of the plaintiff's instructing solicitor sworn
16 July 1998 were read.
That evidence was not the subject of cross-examination.  What was deposed to
was left uncontradicted and
unchallenged.  The evidence was to the effect that
the plaintiff received notice of what the magistrate had done shortly before
Christmas
in 1997 and sought a conference with his solicitor and counsel which,
because of the legal vacation, did not occur until on or about
19 January 1998.
At that conference the plaintiff was advised that he should obtain independent
legal advice.  It would appear that
advice was tendered on the basis there may
have been some apprehension of a claim against the plaintiff's then solicitors
and counsel
as a consequence of the magistrate's decision.  Subsequently the
plaintiff consulted a solicitor whose practice related to matters
of a
different nature and whom the plaintiff considered might be inappropriate in
respect of this sort of matter and the plaintiff
then consulted his present
firm of solicitors with whom he met on 25 February 1998, that is, a little more
than a month after he
had received the prior advice.
<P>

10	That firm, upon being consulted, was concerned as to whether it might have
been retained to advise, in conflict with the interests
of another client.  The
papers and material were delivered to that firm and the instructions to brief
counsel confirmed on or about
10 March 1998, the matter being regarded as
appropriate for senior counsel, the plaintiff's present senior counsel was
retained.
<P>

11	The documents relating to the litigation to which the defendant has already
adverted to were obtained and in due course senior
counsel's advice obtained
and proceedings instituted.  In that context I do not accept the submission
that the lapse of time in itself
and in comparison with the time that would
have been available for an appeal is such that the plaintiff should be denied
relief even
if otherwise entitled.
<P>

12	Nothing has been put forward by the second defendant to indicate that it is
in any way prejudiced by that lapse of time between
the magistrate's decision
and the commencement of these proceedings.  Indeed, none of the matters that
the defendant might have raised
in the proceedings before the magistrate are in
any way prejudiced in the event the matter should be returned there, since it
appears
that such evidence as might be expected to be tendered before the
magistrate is unlikely to be affected by the passing of time considering
the
issues raised in those proceedings.  In any event, no claim for any particular
prejudice is raised.  Although the plaintiff could
have moved faster, the
complications presented by the questions involving the legal practitioners are
such that I would not, on that
ground, deny relief.
<P>

13	The comparison between the delay in instituting the proceedings and the time
allowed to institute the statutory appeal requires,
as does the submission that
a discretion should be exercised against the plaintiff by reason of the
asserted existence of an alternative
remedy by way of the appeal under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.69</a> of
the Act, some further consideration.  That appeal is peculiar to matters under
the Act.  That section provides for the judgments
and orders "of a court
exercising jurisdiction under this Act" to be "final and conclusive" subject to
an appeal to the Supreme Court
by a party to proceedings under the Act "who is
dissatisfied with the judgment or order of the court as being erroneous in
point
of law".  It is clear from subsection (2A) of that section, inter alia,
that the words "erroneous in point of law" are wide enough
to embrace a denial
of natural justice or error in respect of jurisdiction.  To such an appeal the
stated case provision of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a> are applied by subsection (3).
<P>

14	However, in the absence of a judgment or order, the stated case procedure
could not be invoked:  <b>Johnson v. Gibbings</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281895%29%2011%20WN%20%28NSW%29%20137" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1895) 11 WN (NSW) 137</a>;
<b>Ex parte Hornsby Shire Council;  re Crandon</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281935%29%2053%20WN%20%28NSW%29%2022" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1935) 53 WN (NSW) 22</a>;
<b>Hope v. Bathurst Council </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%201%20NSWLR%20535" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 1 NSWLR 535.</a>  The alternative remedy was
not available.  The time limit provided for seeking it therefore was not
particularly relevant except
as perhaps a general guide.
<P>

15	It was accepted in argument by counsel for the second defendant that what
the magistrate did in respect of declining to hear
the matter did not amount,
in itself, to an order or judgment under the Act but it was urged that as a
result of the making of the
order for costs, it was open to test whether the
basis for that order was erroneous in law and thus the basic question could
have
been raised on a stated case brought in respect of the costs order.  I
have grave doubts about this argument on a number of bases.
 Even if such a
review was available and successful without consent, it would not extend to
allowing an order reviewing the magistrate's
declining of jurisdiction in the
principal proceedings, ie. subsequent proceedings would have been necessary
relying on an estoppel
or res judicata.  In any event, it is a matter that goes
to discretion to determine as and between a claim for relief in the nature
of a
prerogative writ or for alternative appellate relief which might be
appropriate:  <b>Hill v. King</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2031%20NSWLR%20654" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 31 NSWLR 654.</a>  I do not regard it as
an appropriate matter to operate as a discretionary bar to the plaintiff's
claim that he may possibly have
been able to have a legal issue incidentally or
collaterally determined.
<P>

16	In support of the assertion that relief, otherwise available, should be
declined in discretion because if the plaintiff succeeds
and the matter returns
to the magistrate a determination in favour of the second defendant would on
the estoppel defence at least
be inevitable and thus these proceedings, so it
is said would be futile, the defendant tendered the amended statement of claim
and
defence thereto in proceedings No. 4774 of 1990 in the Equity Division of
this court, together with the judgments of his Honour Mr.
Justice Young of 20
May 1996, 11 June 1996 and 5 September 1996.  In response the plaintiff relied
upon a notice of motion in the
Local Court seeking the stay of 20 June referred
to earlier and the affidavit sworn 21 November 1997, filed in the Local Court
in
response to that motion, originally to demonstrate that there was before the
magistrate at the time of the finding of no jurisdiction,
awaiting hearing, the
application to have the proceedings stayed because of the application of the
<b>Anschun</b> principle.  After some debate it was accepted that I could have
regard to the material in that affidavit and in particular paragraph
4 thereof
as being the material that raised the questions before the magistrate, ie.
being the evidence before him on the stay application,
on which he would have
to determine that question.  It was common ground between the parties that the
claim in question before the
learned magistrate had not been raised in the
litigation before Young, J.
<P>

17	It was accepted by counsel for the defendant that to succeed in invoking a
futility argument to persuade me that the discretion
should not be exercised to
determine the plaintiff's claim here, it was necessary for him to persuade me
that the <b>Anschun </b>point must, inevitably, either on an application for
stay or by way of defence succeed and notwithstanding that the application of
the doctrine in <b>Anschun</b> is to an extent discretionary.
<P>

18	The decision in <b>Anschun</b> (supra) has been the subject of considerable
debate and judicial exegesis.  The majority of the High Court held that an
order staying
a common law action in tort was correct where the owner of a
crane, against whom damages had been awarded in an action brought by
a workman
who suffered injury arising out of the use of the crane by a hirer, and had
sued the hirer and the owner for damages, had
brought separate proceedings
against the hirer claiming an indemnity in respect of those damages.  It was
held that the owner was
estopped from raising the indemnity agreement in the
separate action on the grounds that, as it had unreasonably refrained from
raising
it in the initial action (since that agreement was a defence to the
hirer's claim for contribution in that action) and it was so
closely connected
with the subject matter of the first action that it was to be expected the
owner would raise it as a defence and
as a basis for recovery from the hirer,
and that a judgment in the second action on the indemnity would conflict with
that on the
first action if in favour of the owner.  At 602 the majority
held:-
<P>

	"In this situation we would prefer to say that there will be no estoppel
unless it appears that the matter relied upon as a defence
in the second action
was so relevant to the subject matter of the first action that it would have
been unreasonable not to rely on
it.  Generally speaking it would be
unreasonable not to plead a defence if, having regard to the nature of the
plaintiff's claim,
and its subject matter, it would be expected that the
defendant would raise the defence and thereby enable the relevant issues to
be
determined in the one proceeding.  In this respect we need to recall that there
are a variety of circumstances, some referred
to in the earlier cases, why a
party may justifiably refrain from litigating an issue in one proceeding yet
wish to litigate the
issue in other proceedings, eg. expense, importance of the
particular issue, motives extraneous to the actual litigation, to mention
but a
few."
<P>

19	Their Honours referred to illustrations of those propositions.  The
principle here enunciated has been discussed and refined
in numerous subsequent
cases but the entitlement, justifiably to refrain, remains and the
circumstances in which that entitlement
might be exercised have not been
judicially codified.  Thus it would be necessary for a court before it could
determine whether an
<b>Anschun</b> estoppel arises, in almost any case, to
look beyond the pleadings in the original action and the pleadings in a
subsequent action
to ascertain the basis on which a claim had not previously
been litigated.  Particularly would this be necessary in a case of this
sort
where the pleadings and the judgment in the action before Young, J. disclose a
complex series of commercial transactions involving
a business relationship
between the parties concerning the purchase of a 50% interest in a business and
contentions that the sale
was affected by deceit, concealed insolvency and
other matters going to fraud.  Complex factual questions involving, in
particular,
conversations and documents and turning greatly on credibility,
were before his Honour.  Evidence might well have disclosed some
proper basis
to avoid inclusion of this claim in that litigation.
<P>

20	It sufficiently appears that the proceedings before Young, J. were such as
not to put the suggestion, that it might be considered
reasonable not to
litigate matters that might be dealt with by a magistrate sitting in the Local
Court, out of court.  Notwithstanding
the contention that the guarantees here
concerned were given in support of the indebtedness of the company, the shares
in which and
the business of which was the subject of the proceedings before
Young, J., it does not appear to me, certainly in the light of what
appears in
the affidavit of the plaintiff sworn 26 November 1997 in which he deposes that
his solicitor advised him that these proceedings
should be separately commenced
to avoid them becoming involved in the complicated Supreme Court proceedings,
that the magistrate
would inevitably or, at least, would have had to, to avoid
falling into error, conclude that the subject matter of the plaintiff's
claim
for contribution was so relevant to the subject matter of the Equity action
that it would have been unreasonable for it not
to have been raised there, ie.
that there was no justifiable basis upon which the plaintiff might have
reasonably refrained from
litigating the issues posed in the proceedings before
the magistrate before Young, J.  I do not consider that the magistrate was
bound to reach such a decision on the material before me and indeed it is clear
that the magistrate would be bound to receive evidence
on the matter raised.
In those circumstances, I do not consider that it would be futile to determine
the question of whether the
magistrate wrongly declined jurisdiction on that
basis. Thus no occasion, as suggested in any of the arguments, for the exercise
of my discretion to decline to grant the plaintiff relief, if otherwise
appropriate, arises.
<P>

21	I turn then to the principal contentions of the parties.  On behalf of the
plaintiff it is contended that a general doctrine
of contribution has been
recognised at common law and in equity since at least the 18th century as
applying between co-sureties.
 But at common law, it would be necessary for the
guarantor, claiming contribution to show that he had already paid more than the
just proportion of the principal debt, although in equity a declaration could
be obtained before payment, provided the necessity
for payment was imminent.  A
claim for contribution could be brought on a common money count claiming money
paid for the use of another
and thus was cognisable at common law and
therefore, even if the statutory jurisdiction of the Local Court does not
include an Equity
jurisdiction, such a claim could be made in an action for the
recovery of any debt, demand or damage "(whether liquidated or unliquidated)
in
which the amount claimed was not more than $40,000" under s.12(1) of the Act,
since such a claim did not fall within the exceptions
from jurisdiction
provided for by s.19.
<P>

22	The defendant, however, contended that the jurisdiction of the Local Court
is limited (relevantly) to what are historically common
law claims for debt or
damages not exceeding $40,000, ie. claims the basis for which does not lie in
the enforcement of the principles
of equity;  that the word "action" as used in
the Act and in particular in ss.12 and 19 connotes an action at common law and
thus
an action in which the principles of equity and rights derived from
equitable principles are not given effect to nor is equitable
relief available.
It is contended that the words "debt, demand or damages" similarly connote a
liability exclusively at common law.
<P>

23	It is submitted that a claim for contribution against a co-guarantor is not
a common law claim for debt but an equitable claim
for contribution and that a
debt does not arise as on the common money count for money paid to the use of
the defendant because where
one of several co-guarantors pays off the creditor,
then that, so it is submitted, is a payment to the use of the principal debtor
not the co-guarantors because the principal debtor is entitled to look to each
of the guarantors for the whole of the indebtedness.
 It is contended that such
a payment is exclusively to the use of the principal debtor and should not be
categorised as also to the
use of the co-guarantor to the extent that payment
exceeds the just proportion of the principal debt as the plaintiff contends.

<P>

24	These submissions raise most interesting and important questions for the
jurisdiction of the Local Court, as to the ambit of
matters which may be
pleaded using a common money count and the entitlement to and provenance of the
modern right to contribution.
<P>

25	It is to be noted that the Act at no point expressly repudiates equitable
jurisdiction or expressly adopts a solely common law
jurisdiction.  Section
12(1) provides:-
<P>

	"Subject to this Part, a court sitting in its General Division has
jurisdiction to hear and determine actions for the recovery
of any debt, demand
or damage (whether liquidated or unliquidated) in which the amount claimed is
not more than $40,000, whether
on a balance of account or after an admitted
set-off or otherwise.
<P>

26	Section 19 provides for exceptions to jurisdiction as follows:-
<P>

	"(1)	A court shall not have jurisdiction under this Act in any of the
following cases:-
<P>

	(a)	where the validity or effect of any devise, bequest or limitation under
any will or settlement, or under any document in the
nature of a settlement, is
disputed;
<P>

	(b)	actions for passing-off, wrongful arrest, false imprisonment or malicious
prosecution, or for or in the nature of defamation,
or for seduction or
enticement, or for breach of promise of marriage;
<P>

	(c)	actions for infringement of letters patent or copyright;
<P>

	(d)	actions for the detention of goods, where any such action is for the
detention of goods comprised in a hire-purchase agreement,
by the owner of
those goods, or any person acting on the owner's behalf;  or
<P>

	(e)	actions in which the title to land is in question.
<P>

	(2)	If the title to land incidentally comes in question in an action, the
court shall have power to decide the claim which it is
the immediate object of
the action to enforce, but the judgment of the court shall not be evidence of
title between the parties or
their privies in another action in that court or
in any proceedings in any court, whether or not it is a Local Court."
<P>

27	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 20(2)</a> provides for contribution from a joint debtor.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ja119/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 20(1)</a>
and (2) read:-
<P>

	"(1)	Where a plaintiff has a cause of action against two or more persons
jointly answerable, it shall be sufficient if any one
or more of those persons
is served with process, and judgment may be given or entered up and enforced
against the person or persons
so served notwithstanding that others jointly
liable have not been served or sued, or are not within the jurisdiction of the
court.
<P>

	(2)	A person against whom such a judgment is given or entered up and who
satisfies the whole or any part of the judgment shall
be entitled to demand and
recover contribution from any other person jointly liable with the person."
<P>

28	A statutory right for indemnity or contribution between co-sureties or
co-debtors and of obtaining the specialty or security
surety had existed in New
South Wales from well prior to the insertion by the Government Guarantees Act
(No. 57 of 1934) in The Usury,
Bills of Lading, and Written Memoranda Act
(1902) of s.8A which reads as follows:-
<P>

	"Every person who, being surety for the debt or duty of another or being
liable with another for any debt or duty, shall pay such
debt or perform such
duty, shall be entitled to have assigned to him or to a trustee for him every
judgment specialty or other security
which shall be held by the creditor in
respect of such debt or duty whether such judgment specialty or other security
shall or shall
not be deemed at law to have been satisfied by the payment of
the debt or performance of the duty;  and such person shall be entitled
to
stand in the place of the creditor and to use all the remedies and if need be
and upon a proper indemnity to use the name of the
creditor in any action or
other proceeding at law or in equity in order to obtain from the principal
debtor or any co-surety, co-contractor,
or co-debtor, as the case may be,
indemnification for the advances made and loss sustained by the person who
shall have so paid such
debt or performed such duty and such payment or
performance so made by such surety shall not be pleadable in bar of any such
action
or other proceedings by him:
<P>

	Provided always that no co-surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor shall be
entitled to recover from any other co-surety, co-contractor,
or co-debtor by
the means aforesaid more than the just proportion to which as between those
parties themselves such last-mentioned
person shall be justly liable."
<P>

29	That provision had been taken from United Kingdom legislation which had long
recognised a right by statute by that means to obtain
contribution.
<P>

30	The Usury, Bills of Lading, and Written Memoranda Act was, by the Usury,
Bills of Lading, and Written Memoranda (Repeal) Act
(1990) (No. 7) repealed but
by that Act the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lrpa404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act</a> (1965) (No. 32) was
amended by omitting <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lrpa404/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.3</a> thereof and by inserting after <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lrpa404/index.html#p1" class="autolink_findacts">Part 1</a> a new Part, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lrpa404/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part
2</a>, viz:-
<P>

	"<b>Guarantees</b>
<P>

	<b>Surety discharging liability to be entitled to securities (see Act No. 43
1902, s.8A)</b>
<P>

	3(1)	A person who, being surety for the debt or duty or another, or being
liable with another for a debt or duty, pays that debt,
or performs that duty,
is entitled:-
<P>

	(a)	to have assigned to that person, or to a trustee for that person, every
judgment, specialty or other security held by the creditor
in respect of that
debt or duty, whether or not that judgment, specialty or other security is
taken at law to have been satisfied
by the payment of the debt or the
performance of the duty;  and
<P>

	(b)	to stand in the place of the creditor and to use all the remedies, and, if
necessary, and on a proper indemnity, to use the
name of the creditor in any
proceedings to obtain from the principal debtor or any co-surety, co-contractor
or co-debtor (as the
case requires) indemnity for the advances made and loss
sustained by the person who paid the debt or performed the duty.
<P>

	2.	The payment of the debt or the performance of the duty by a surety is not a
defence to any such proceedings referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lrpa404/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">subsection 1.</a>
<P>

	3.	A co-surety, co-contractor or co-debtor is not entitled under this section
to recover from another co-surety, co-contractor
or co-debtor more than the
proportion to which, as between those parties themselves, that person is justly
liable."
<P>

31	Previously, the Small Debts Court under the Small Debts Recovery Act (1912)
and its predecessors of 1905 and 1899, recognised
a similar right to
contribution by a defendant from other persons jointly liable and the ability
to assert that right in those courts.
 By s.15 of the Small Debts Recovery Act,
contribution might be similarly recovered.  Thus generally, contribution could
be obtained
under statute and in the Local Court in particular circumstances.
All of which is strongly suggestive that the restriction that counsel
for the
second defendant contends is inherent in the drafting of the Act is unlikely to
be so contained.
<P>

32	Further, the drafting of the Act is such that it would seem likely that if
contribution could have been obtained, historically
on a special assumpsit or
if a pleading in quasi contract, as on a special money count for money to the
use of another or money paid
by the plaintiff for the defendant at his request,
might be available (they being common law pleadings) or if the common law
itself
recognises, whether the origin of the principle was in equity or not, an
actionable right to contribution in these circumstances,
then such an action
would be within jurisdiction even at common law and the magistrate would have
fallen into error in declining
jurisdiction.
<P>

33	A matter of mere history should not fetter the construction of the statute.
It is one thing to look to the origin of a principle
on which a right to relief
may have been based but another entirely to hold that there is no jurisdiction
to afford relief now, when
the older rigid demarcations of jurisdiction are
regarded as arid, on the ground that the origins of the principle defining the
liability
lie in antiquity in equity, notwithstanding that the product of the
application of the principle will enable a finding of liability
as and between
one party and another in money terms such as to have the form of a judgment for
the payment of money from one party
to another as is apparently contemplated by
the Act and contemplated by the common law.  As will later be seen, the origin
of the
right to contribution was said to be in natural justice, which one in
modern times would expect to be recognised in all courts.
<P>

34	Insofar as the argument is that so much depends on the word "action", in
Volume 37 of Halsbury's Laws (4th ed.), para.17, the
word is defined as apt to
include any civil proceedings commenced by writ or in any other manner
prescribed by rules of court and
is described as having a wide signification in
its natural meaning extending to any proceedings in the nature of litigation
between
a plaintiff and a defendant of a civil nature.
<P>

35	It has been held in New South Wales in <b>re Carter Smith, ex parte Taxation
Commissioners</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1908/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1908] NSWStRp 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281908%29%208%20SR%28NSW%29%20246" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1908) 8 SR(NSW) 246</a> at 249 by Street, J. (as he then was)
that the word, when being used by the legislature and construing it according
to its true legal
meaning, "in its proper legal sense it is a generic term of
<i>nomen generale</i>, and includes every sort of legal proceeding".
<P>

36	The additional words "debt, demand or damages" appear to be used in the
sense of limiting the jurisdiction of the court to the
recovery of money sums
as a result of pre-existing liability.  None of these terms preclude
proceedings and remedies in which equitable
principles are applied.
<P>

37	Debts may be both legal and equitable:  <b>Webb v. Stenton</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281883%29%2011%20QB%20518" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1883) 11 QB
518.</a>  A debt is a sum of money which is now payable or will become payable in
the future by reason of a present obligation:  <b>Webb</b> (supra) per Lindley,
LJ. at 526-528.  It is something recoverable by an action for debt and thus
involves a sum that is ascertained
or can be ascertained:  <b>Ogdens Limited v.
Weinberg</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281906%29%2095%20LT%20567" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1906) 95 LT 567.</a>  A demand is simply a clear intimation of a
peremptory and unconditional character that payment is required.  See <b>re
Colonial Finance, Mortgage, Investment and Guarantee Corporation Limited</b>
(1905) 6 SR(NSW) at 9.  It was held in <b>Hall Brothers SS Co. Limited v.
Young</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281939%29%201%20KB%20748" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1939) 1 KB 748</a> at 756 by the Court of Appeal per Green MR.,
that:-
<P>

	"'Damages' to an English lawyer imports this idea, that the sums payable by
way of damages are sums which fall to be paid by reason
of some breach of duty
or obligation, whether that duty or obligation is imposed by contract, by the
general law, or legislation."
<P>

38	In my view, none of these terms carries the inherent limitation for which
the second defendant argues.
<P>

39	The second defendant in its submissions concedes <b>Buzera Pty. Limited v.
Megan Enterprises Pty. Limited</b> (Cohen, J. unreported, 19 March 1998)
involved a claim for rent under an equitable lease and while the application of
an equitable
principle arose, the claim for rent was a common law claim for
debt, ie. thus the case supports the view that a common law entitlement
to a
sum of money ascertained or ascertainable in quantum may proceed out of the
application of equitable principles to the relationship
between the parties.
<P>

40	In order to support the argument that those terms embrace only purely common
law concepts, counsel seeks to rely on cases on
s.24 of the Common Law
Procedure Act which limited the entitlement to the facilitative procedure of
the specially endorsed writ to
liquidated claims, at a time preceding the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a>, when common law and equity were separately administered
by this court.  The decision of Mr. Justice Brereton in <b>Secretary of the
State Advances Recovery Office of the Republic of South Africa v. Fine</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281968%29%2087%20WN%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1968) 87 WN 1 (NSW)</a> 445 was referred to.  In that case the plaintiff sued at
common law and purported to rely upon a common money count for money lent
but
sought to rely upon particulars that the liability arose pursuant to a written
agreement requiring the monies lent to be repaid
in South African currency in
Pretoria.  In those circumstances for technical reasons the common money count
for debt or on accounts
stated was not available.  However, his Honour held
that the claim was technically a claim for damages rather than debt, but
notwithstanding
remained liquidated.  His Honour was concerned to examine
whether the claim was for "a debt or liquidated demand for money arising
out of
a contract express or implied" as required by s.24(1) of the Common Law
Procedure Act (1899).  He noted that Mr. Justice Sholl
in <b>Alexander v. Ajax
Insurance Co. Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1956/70.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] VicLawRp 70</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%20VLR%20436" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) VLR 436</a> had held that the phrase "a debt or
liquidated demand" in respect of a claim at common law included a claim for
which an action in
debt would lie, a claim for which an indebitatus count would
lie, including those covered by quantum meruit or quantum valebat and
a claim
for which an action in covenant or special assumpsit would lie, provided, that
the claim was for a specific amount, not involving
in the calculation thereof,
elements, the selection whereof, was dependent on the opinion of a jury.
<P>

41	Sholl, J. in <b>Alexander</b> (supra) was concerned to examine the meaning
of the expression "debt or liquidated demand" as used in O.XIII, r.3 of the
Victorian
Supreme Court Rules for the purpose of distinguishing between that
concept and damages, since judgment had been signed on a writ
of summons which
was not "endorsed for a liquidated demand" within the meaning of the Rule and
therefore, it was asserted, the judgment
had been irregularly entered.  In
reaching the conclusion to which I have already referred, his Honour referred
to <b>Lagos v. Grunwaldt</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281910%29%201%20KB%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1910) 1 KB 41</a> and the views of Cozens Hardy, M.R.
and Farwell, LJ. that the phrase "debt or liquidated demand" was intended to
refer to everything
that could be sued for under the old common law indebitatus
counts.
<P>

42	He also referred to <b>Finn v. Gavin</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1905/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1905] VicLawRp 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281905%29%20VLR%2093" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1905) VLR 93</a> in which Madden, CJ.,
holding that a claim could not be specially endorsed when brought as an action
on a covenant of indemnity,
held that the remedy lay in damages, the indemnity
arising from an express agreement rather than by implication of law.
<P>

43	As his Honour's exploration of the history of the phrase discloses, it had
long been used, certainly since the first report of
the Law Commissioners in
the United Kingdom in 1851, as expressing the necessary circumstances in which
a specially endorsed writ
could be obtained at common law.  Not surprisingly,
since his Honour was dealing with circumstances prior to the coming into effect
of the Judicature Act (1873) (36 and 37 Vict., C. 66) (and hence as applicable
in New South Wales before the passing of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a>) his Honour was
not concerned to distinguish between liabilities arising at law and in equity.
In my view, neither the decision of
Brereton, J. nor that of Sholl, J. assist
the defendant's submission and insofar as contribution might be obtained at
common law
by an action on a common money count or on a special assumpsit, they
are against it.
<P>

44	Even before the "fusion" (pace Meagher, Gummow &amp; Lehane Equity (1992)
[220] et. seq.) occasioned by the Judicature Act, Bullen
&amp; Leake's
Pleadings (3rd ed.) (Precedents of pleadings in personal actions in the
superior courts of common law ... by Edward
Bullen, Esq. and Stephen Martin
Leake, Esq. at p.43), notes the common indebitatus count for monies paid as
being available, where
a surety pays the debt of the principal debtor or where
one of several co-contractors pays the whole debt for which the other
co-contractors
are jointly liable with him, in an action for contribution in
this form.  Similarly, an action brought pursuant to a statutory right
for
payment of monies might appropriately be brought at common law on a common
money count.
<P>

45	As to the argument for unavailability of the money paid count on the basis
that in the contribution context the money was paid
solely for the benefit of
the principal debtor or the creditor, the passage in the judgment of Mr.
Justice Brennan (as he then was)
in <b>Mahoney v. McManus</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/54.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 54</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20180%20CLR%20370" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 180 CLR
370</a> at 386, whilst clearly enough confirming the entitlement of a co-surety who
has paid the debt to recovery by way of contribution
of his just proportion,
does not support the proposition that the payment of the entire debt is solely
for the purpose of the creditor
(and it follows for the purpose of the
principal debtor).  His Honour is there discussing the application of the
equitable principle
that a creditor ought not to exercise his legal rights
inequitably, enforcing disproportionate contributions from co-sureties.  That
case concerned the appropriateness of contributions in equity. The trial judge
had declared payments by the company, which had gone
into liquidation, to its
creditors as having to be treated as if they had been made by a co-guarantor.
In such circumstances in equity
there would be an entitlement to contribution.
The case was merely concerned with the proposition of whether an equity arose.
His
Honour's reasons do not support the unavailability of the common money
count or a common law remedy.
<P>

46	Whatever may be the origin of the right of contribution, it is discussed in
great detail in the judgment of Giles, J. (as he
then was) in <b>Morgan
Equipment Company &amp; Ors v. Rodgers (No. 2) </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2033%20NSWLR%20467" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 33 NSWLR 467</a> at
481D-486A in a most instructive review of the authorities.  What his Honour was
concerned to examine in that case was not whether
the common law gave a right
of contribution or whether the right exclusively lay in equity.  That latter
proposition, of course,
was not what he held to be the case in the passage at
p.482 where his Honour expressly acknowledged the right to obtain contribution
between co-sureties in an action at law in assumpsit as referred to in
<b>Knight v. Hughes</b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1828/917.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1828] EngR 917</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281828%29%203%20C%20%26%20P%20467" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1828) 3 Car &amp; P. 467</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=172%20ER%20504" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">172 ER 504.</a>  He was
concerned to consider whether in such an action there should be an equitable
division of the costs of obtaining the contribution.
 His Honour said:-
<P>

	"... equity was not confined by the form of action but could develop its own
principles according to the basic concept of natural
justice described by
Kitto, J. in <b>Albion Insurance Co. Limited v. Government Insurance Office
(NSW)</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1969/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1969] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281969%29%20121%20CLR%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1969) 121 CLR 342</a> at 350-352.  There may not have been a clear
dividing line between contribution at law and contribution in equity, and the
same basic
concept underlay both:  see <b>Manufacturers Mutual Insurance
Limited v. GIO</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%207%20ANZ%20Insurance%20Cases%2061%2d158" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 7 ANZ Insurance Cases 61-158.</a>  But at the present day
the rights of sureties inter-se are substantially equitable rather than
contractual (see <b>AGC (Advances) Limited v. West</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%205%20NSWLR%20590" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 5 NSWLR 590</a> at
604) and I should act accordingly."
<P>

47	What his Honour there says is in the context of looking at the question of
whether the sureties should between themselves bear
equally the burden and
benefit of obtaining contribution by contributing equally to the costs as the
balance of his judgment makes
clear.  He was not concerned in the last sentence
quoted to assert that contribution, well recognised as a legal remedy in the
19th
and early 20th century had evolved to being an entitlement which lies
solely in equitable principles.  Indeed many of the cases cited
by his Honour
for the availability of an action for contribution were common law cases.
<P>

48	Similarly Hodgson, J. (as he then was) in <b>AGC (Advances) Limited v.
West</b> (supra) in the passage at 664, commencing at B-F, was concerned to
examine the origins and nature of the right of contribution arising
as between
co-sureties and whether such a right depended upon an implied contract or upon
principles of equity rather than whether
the right was enforceable at common
law or in equity.  His Honour was concerned to undertake that task since in
that case he said:-
<P>

	"However, in a case such as the present, I do not think that such an implied
contract would arise, or at least if there were such
an implied contract, I do
not think it would prevail over any equitable principles relating to
contribution and indemnity which conflicted
with it."
<P>

49	Thus, his Honour was concerned with the prospect of conflict between those
principles, the operation of which would lead to the
implication of a contract
and its particular terms and the principles of equity relating to contribution
and indemnity.
<P>

50	It was for that reason his Honour reached his conclusion:-
<P>

	"In my view in this case, equitable principals relating to contribution of
indemnity should be applied having regard to the substance
of the transaction
as I have found it, and I do not think that any implied contract which might be
thought to arise between the parties
would prevent the application of such
principals."
<P>

51	His Honour was concerned to ascertain whether or not the prima facie
equitable principle of equal contribution between sureties
who had co-ordinate
liabilities should or should not be departed from, not whether each could
enforce an obligation to contribute
at common law.
<P>

52	There is nothing in the equitable principles which would operate to bar a
common law remedy, nor do any of the cases support
such a bar.
<P>

53	It is to be noted that the judgment of Kitto, J. in <b>Albion Insurance Co.
Limited v. Government Insurance Office (NSW)</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1969/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1969] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281969%29%20121%20CLR%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1969) 121 CLR 342</a> in dealing
with contribution between insurers, points out that Lord Mansfield in such
cases as <b>Godin v. London Assurance Company</b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1758/138.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1758] EngR 138</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281758%29%201%20Burr%20489" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1758) 1 Burr. 489</a>;  (97) ER
419 was sitting at common law and simply brought together the two principles
applicable at law no less than equity that
persons who are under co-ordinate
liabilities to make good the one loss (eg. sureties), must share the burden pro
rata;  the second
being that the policies of marine insurance being contracts
of indemnity, the relationship between insurers in such a case is analogous
to
the relationship between several sureties for a debt.  In examining this
question, his Honour held:-
<P>

	"The general doctrine of contribution, as I have said, forms part of the
common law.  It was applicable by Lord Mansfield in <b>Godin v. London
Assurance Co.</b> (178) 1 Burr.489;  <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1758/138.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1758] EngR 138</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=97%20ER%20419" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[97 ER 419]</a> and <b>Newby v. Reed</b><a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1746/596.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1746] EngR 596</a>; (1763)
Bl. W. 416  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=96%20ER%20237" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[96 ER 237]</a> no less than by Lord Chief Baron Eyre when exercising
the equitable jurisdiction of the Court of Exchequer in <b>Dering v. Winchelsea
(Earl)</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281787%29%201%20Cox%20Eq%20Cas%20318" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1787) 1 Cox Eq. Cas. 318</a> [  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=29%20ER%201184" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">29 ER 1184].</a>  This was because the basic
concept was accepted by both law and equity as one of natural justice, as
indeed it had been by the law
of other countries since ancient times"
<P>

54	His Honour illustrated that proposition with numerous examples including
referring to the judgment in <b>Dering v. Winchelsea </b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281787%29%201%20Cox%20Eq%20Cas%20318" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1787) 1 Cox Eq. Cas.
318</a> and cited the passage from 321:-
<P>

	"If we take a view of the cases both in law and equity we shall find that
contribution is bottomed and fixed on general principles
of justice. ...
founded on equality, and established by the law of all nations ..."
<P>

55	His Honour went on:-
<P>

	"And it had gone on to show that law and equity were at one as to the nature
of the right, though the doctrine of equality operated
more effectually in a
court of equity than in a court of law, and there were differences as to the
mode and conditions of its application;
 see generally Halsbury's Laws of
England (3rd ed.), Vol.14, pp.492, 493, paras.394, 395;  Vol.22, pp.266-268,
paras.527, 528.  The
right arises at law when 'one of several persons had paid
more than his proper share towards discharging a common obligation':  <b>Davies
v. Humphries</b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1840/223.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1840] EngR 223</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281840%29%206%20M%20%26%20W%20153" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1840) 6 M &amp; W 153</a> at 168-169 <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1840/223.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1840] EngR 223</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=151%20ER%20361" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(151 ER 361</a> at 367-368)."
<P>

56	Windeyer, J. agreed.  Barwick, CJ., McTiernan and Menzies, JJ. noted the
origin of the right as arising from the common law decisions
of Lord Mansfield
but did not find it necessary to discuss the history in such detail.  The
reasoning of Kitto, J. was accepted by
Gibbs, CJ. with whom Murphy and Aitken,
JJ. agreed, as authority for the general principles as to entitlement to
contribution from
co-sureties in <b>Mahoney</b> <b>v. McManus </b>(supra) at
376, although his Honour was not concerned in that case to distinguish between
an entitlement at law or in equity.
<P>

57	It must be remembered that there were distinctions between the right of
contribution as in equity or in law.  At law, as and
between several
co-sureties where one became insolvent, the right to contribution differed from
that provided in equity.  At law
the proportion recoverable was taken according
to the whole number of sureties, no account being taken of the fact that one
surety
was no longer available for contribution:  <b>Cowell v. Edwards</b>
<a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1800/234.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1800] EngR 234</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281800%29%202%20Bos%20%26%20P%20268" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1800) 2 B &amp; P 268.</a>  Equity, on the other hand, did take account of this
fact and allowed the recovery of a proportion according to the number remaining
available for contribution without the insolvent co-surety.
<P>

58	Following the passing of the Judicature Act (36 and 37 Vict., C. 66) (and in
New South Wales, The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a> and in particular <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p4" class="autolink_findacts">Part 4)</a> in the
event of conflict equitable rules generally prevail so that it was rarely
necessary nor as efficacious to invoke the common
law.  Further, at common law,
it was as the plaintiff submitted, necessary for the party claiming
contribution to show that they
had already paid more than the just proportion
in order to recover their loss.  This distinction is noted by Starke, J. in
<b>McLean v. Discount and Finance Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1939/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1939] HCA 38</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281939%29%2064%20CLR%20312" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1939) 64 CLR 312</a> at 341, when
noting the right to contribution at law.
<P>

59	In any event, nowadays damages, whether legal or equitable, are damages and
a debt, whether at law or in equity, is a debt. 
The Act refers to "damages"
and damages or "debt".  It does not seek to distinguish expressly between legal
and equitable debts.
 Although the question was not decisive of the appeal,
these concepts were discussed in <b>McIntosh v. Shashoua</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281931%29%2046%20CLR%20494" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1931) 46 CLR 494</a>,
in particular in the context of bankruptcy legislation as the Federal
Bankruptcy Act, in dealing with a debt, had omitted the formula
used in former
legislation "in law or equity".  Both Gavan Duffy, CJ. and Dixon, J.
categorised an equitable liability for contribution
to a co-surety as a debt.
Starke, J., after a review of authority, was of the view that debts, whether
due at law or in equity, were
debts sufficient to ground a bankruptcy petition
against a debtor and that the Federal Bankruptcy Act in which the words
"whether
due at law or in equity" were omitted in conformity with the Western
Australian Bankruptcy Act of 1892 where the Judicature Act was
in force, so
that the language of the Federal Bankruptcy Act should be construed
consistently with that in the then United Kingdom
Bankruptcy Act and the
bankruptcy law previously enforced in all the States of Australia, so that for
that purpose the word "debt"
had this broader meaning.  On this issue, Evatt,
J. differed since at that time, the judicature system which now prevails with
its
fusion of law and equity in New South Wales, was not then in force and
because, in his view, the omission of the words "due at law
or in equity" from
the stated requirement for a petitioner's debt left to such jurisdictions as
New South Wales, the question of
determination as to whether what was recovered
was or was not a debt.
<P>

60	In the context of discussing the right of the guarantor to an indemnity
against the principal debtor and in particular the rights
peculiar to equity,
the Federal Court in <b>Abigroup Limited v. Abignano</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/567.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCA 567</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2039%20FCR%2074" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 39 FCR 74</a> at 83
following an extensive review of authority, noted that a merely equitable right
to enforcing an indemnity does not constitute
a debt and that until the
guarantor had paid up he had no debt or right at law at all.  But, their
Honours were not there concerned
to distinguish between the debt that arose at
common law when a surety paid more than the just proportion of the principal
debt and
equitable entitlements.  They were dealing with the position when only
the equitable pre-conditions to relief were satisfied.  Their
Honours referred
to the very passages in the judgment of Starke, J. in <b>McLean</b> (supra) and
that of Gibbs, J. in <b>Mahoney</b> (supra) to which I have referred.  They
concluded that there would in the instant case be a debt when the appellant had
discharged
the relevant claim.
<P>

61	It was no doubt because of the recognition by the Bankruptcy Act (UK 1883)
in s.37 of equitable debts as capable of supporting
a petition that it was held
in <b>Wolmershausen v. Gullick</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281893%29%202%20Ch%20514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1893) 2 Ch. 514</a> that the liability of a
bankrupt co-surety to contribution, though unascertained at the time of the
bankruptcy proceedings, is a
debt provable in a bankruptcy.  In that often
cited decision, Wright, J. traced the history both at common law and in equity
of the
right to contribution and noted the right at common law as existing when
there had been actual payment by the plaintiff of more than
his share.
<P>

62	In <b>Armstrong v. Commissioner of Stamp Duties</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%202%20NSWLR%2063" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 2 NSWLR 63</a>
although the President, Mr. Justice Wallace did not find it necessary to
distinguish between equitable or legal rights as to contribution,
Mr. Justice
Walsh held, commencing at 70:-
<P>

	"The other point upon which I wish to make some comment concerns the question
whether a claim made for contribution, by a donor
who has paid the whole of the
duty, would be enforceable at common law or only in equity and the further
question whether, if the
claim is an equitable one, this makes any difference
which for present purposes is relevant.  In the cases there are statements to
the effect that the right depends upon equitable principles and 'is founded in
doctrines of equity'.  See <b>Ruabon Steamship Co. v. London Assurance</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1900%5d%20AC%206" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1900] AC 6</a> at 11, citing <b>Stirling v. Forrester</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281821%29%203%20Bli%20575" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1821) 3 Bli. 575.</a>  But,
although the doctrine of contribution originated in equity, it was at a later
time recognised and applied in the common law
action for money paid, although
these actions were 'almost always accompanied by the suggestion of being a sort
of importation from
equity' (<b>Stoljar</b>, p.148).  I think it must be
accepted that, as between two co-debtors who are both directly liable for the
debt to the same creditor,
one of them who has paid more than his proper share
may sue at common law for contribution.  It may be true, as Vaughan Williams,
LJ. said in <b>Bonner v. Tottenham and Edmonton Permanent Investment Building
Society</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281899%29%201%20QB%20161" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1899) 1 QB 161</a> at 174-176;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1895%2d9%5d%20All%20ER%20549" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1895-9] All ER Rep. 549</a>;  that there
are two separate and distinct principles of liability, one at common law and
the other in equity.  But, upon his analysis
of those principles, the present
case would be within the common law principle.  It seems, however, that in
England a claim for contribution
of a type which can be brought at common law
may be defeated if the circumstances are such that in equity the claim for
contribution
would fail.  See <b>Cunningham-Reid v. Public Trustee</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1944%5d%20KB%20602" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1944]
KB 602</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1944%5d%202%20All%20ER%206" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1944] 2 All ER 6."</a>
<P>

63	Thus, the case law does not support the defendant's submission.  Neither do
the texts.  In Restitution Law in Australia, by Mason
and Carter, the learned
authors at para.609 express the view:-
<P>

	"A general doctrine of contribution has been recognised at common law and in
equity since at least the eighteenth century (see
<b>Albion Insurance Co.
Limited v. Government Insurance Office (NSW)</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1969/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1969] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281969%29%20121%20CLR%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1969) 121 CLR 342</a> at 350-32).
There used to be differences between law and equity where one of several
co-obligors became insolvent or died (see <b>Phillips and O'Donovan</b>,
pp.525-526;  Meagher, Gummow and Lenane, 1003).  However, the equitable
principles flowing from <b>Dering v. Earl of Winchelsea</b> (1787) 2 Box &amp;
Pul 270;  <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1787/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1787] EngR 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=126%20ER%201276" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">126 ER 1276</a> now prevail (<b>Armstrong v. Commissioner of Stamp
Duties</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%2069%20SR%20%28NSW%29%2038" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 69 SR (NSW) 38</a> at 48).  The essence of the right to
contribution lies in the payment of more than (P's) 'proper share towards
discharging a common
obligation' (<b>Didmore v. Leventhal</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1936/22.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1936] NSWStRp 22</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%2036%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 36 SR
(NSW) 378</a> at 385 per Jordan, CJ.
<P>

	Despite the clear analysis in <b>Dering's</b> case itself, nineteenth century
cases explained contribution on the basis of implied contract (<b>Craythorne v.
Swinburne</b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1807/343.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1807] EngR 343</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281807%29%2014%20Ves%20Jr%20160" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1807) 14 Ves Jun 160</a> at 164, 169;  <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1807/343.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1807] EngR 343</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=33%20ER%20482" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">33 ER 482</a> at 483-484;

per Griffith, CJ).  This is now seen as a fiction.  Other grounds such as
'equitable principles' (see, eg. <b>Moulton v. Roberts </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%20Qd%20R%20135" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] Qd. R. 135</a> at
139), 'natural justice' (see, eg. <b>Albion Insurance Co. Limited v. Government

of 'reason, justice and law' (<b>Marsack v.

unhelpful except as a pointer to a non-contractual analysis.
<P>

	The leading authority on the doctrine of contribution is the judgment of
Kitto, J. in <b>Albion Insurance Co. Limited v. Government Insurance Office
(NSW)</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1969/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1969] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281969%29%20121%20CLR%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1969) 121 CLR 342.</a>  After tracing the historical origins, he drew
attention to the underlying doctrine of equality as the basis of the common law
and
equitable rules."
<P>

64	(As I have shown, the remarks there made as to equitable principles
prevailing merely relate to post-Judicature Act resolution
of conflict, the
distinction being drawn by the learned authors in order to lay to rest the
necessity for reliance on the fiction
of a contract.)
<P>

65	The learned authors of Equity, Doctrines and Remedies by Meagher, Gummow and
Lehane (3rd ed.) in their chapter dealing with the
topic commencing at p.286
recognise that that right of contribution was available both at law and in
equity, going on to discuss
the difference between the modes of exercise of
that right in the two different jurisdictions and explaining the remarks noted
above
in <b>AGC Advances Limited v. West</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%205%20NSWLR%20590" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 5 NSWLR 590</a> at 604 in the
context of the lesser restrictions and greater availability of the remedy in
equity.
<P>

66	Similarly, the common law action is noted in the Modern Law of Contract (3rd
ed.) O'Donovan and Phillips at 614  to very much
the same effect.  At 632-635,
the learned authors explore the modes of enforcement and their Honours note
that it was as a result
of the Judicature Act that it was not necessary to
distinguish between an action at law or an action in equity and the greater
facilitation
of a just result available in equity became generally available.
But they note that the action might properly be brought as a claim
at law for a
simple contract debt in quasi-contract, relying on the old common law cases.
<P>

67	In my view the analogy from the enactment of the Federal bankruptcy
legislation referred to in <b>McIntosh v. Shashoua</b> (supra) is clear and the
words employed in s.12 of the Act, particularly in the context where specific
exceptions are made in s.19,
apt to include a claim for contribution which
would result in a judgment in money terms.  The words, "action", "debt",
"demand" or
"damages" and the word "judgment" (often as it is associated with
common law claims) do not carry such significance as to indicate
that the Local
Court, unlike any other court, should have no cognisance of matters where the
origin of a claim for liability for
money might lie in an equitable doctrine.
The sections should be construed widely in my view and not to import the
restriction asserted.
 This view accords with that of Bruce, J. in <b>Batley
&amp; Anor v. Local Court of New South Wales &amp; Anor</b> (unreported 4
February 1999 at 4-6).  In any event the right was and is enforceable at common
law.  Whether the right to contribution
was adopted by the common law from
equity or whether it became available simply because it was embraced within a
common money count,
or whether it also remained in equity, in my view, there is
nothing in the Act which would exclude such a claim from the jurisdiction
of
the Local Court.
<P>

68	I therefore conclude that the right to seek contribution was and is
available in the action.  The present proceedings did not
rely on a money count
or on its face, directly on a pleading of a special assumpsit.  In accordance
with the modern practice the
facts were pleaded.  It was necessary, therefore,
to identify the causes of action.  The magistrate, as best one can ascertain,
did
not do so.  Had he sought to do so, he may have identified a cause of
action in equity but he could not have done so without identifying
also a
common law claim, without falling into error.  There was available on the facts
pleaded a concurrent, though not co-extensive
cause of action at common law
and, if the evidence disclosed full payment, it may be that the plaintiff was
entitled to recover fully.
<P>

69	The magistrate, in my view, wrongly declined jurisdiction.  That is a
jurisdictional error.  There was no suggestion in the argument
before me, but
that error of that kind in this case is of such a nature as is amenable to
relief by orders in lieu of the prerogative
writs.  I am of the view that the
plaintiff is entitled to the declaration in the appropriate terms and the
appropriate consequential
orders.
<P>

70	The matter will be re-listed so that I might hear counsel on the appropriate
form of orders and as to costs.
