70092/98	<b>REGINA   v   BASSAM CHAMI</b>
<P>

SENTENCE
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The prisoner, Bassam Chami, was charged with the
murder of Larry Cox at Auburn on 25 April 1998.  On the presentation
of an
indictment charging him with the commission of that crime on 21 September 1999,
the prisoner pleaded not guilty to murder but
guilty to manslaughter.  The
Crown accepted that plea in satisfaction of the indictment and the prisoner was
duly convicted of manslaughter.
<P>

2  	The deceased, Larry Cox, who was thirty-four years of age, was
apparently celebrating Anzac Day with friends at the Auburn Village
Tavern in
Auburn.  He sustained his fatal injuries at or shortly after midnight.  A
statement of agreed facts concerning the commission
of the crime was placed
before the Court and from that statement (Exhibit A) I set out the
following:
<P>

<i>"About midnight, the deceased became involved in a verbal argument with
Shadi Kouzaiha in the front room area of the Tavern, near
the band.  The two
security staff Paul Langi and Tausinga Langi then confronted Shadi Kouzaiha and
physically removed him from the
premises.  At this time a fight erupted between
the Security Staff and a number of other Lebanese persons near the doorway of
the
Tavern.  This incident was recorded on video within the Tavern.  A large
fight erupted between Security Staff, persons of middle-eastern
appearance and
other persons from the hotel.</i>
<P>

<i>The deceased left the inside of the Tavern and become [sic] involved in a
fight outside on the footpath area with Shady Kouzaiha.
 Kouzaiha was seen to
punch the deceased in the face.  The deceased was seen to throw a punch at
Kouzaiha, but missed.  The deceased
then appeared to stumble and got up
again.</i>
<P>

<i>Shortly after, the prisoner, who was a friend of Kouzaiha, approached the
deceased and was seen to be waving a knife in front of him
in a jabbing
motion.</i>
<P>

<i>The prisoner then stabbed the deceased in the left side of his chest with
the knife.</i>
<P>

<i>The deceased fell backwards onto the ground.  An ambulance was summoned and
the deceased was found to be dead on arrival at Auburn
Hospital.  An autopsy
was conducted on the deceased on 26 April 1998.  The deceased was found to have
a stab wound consistent with
being caused by a knife.  The stab wound was
located 65 millimetres below the left nipple and was 60 millimetres deep.  The
stab
wound entered the lower left side of the parietal pericardium and cut
through the lower lateral edge of the right ventricle of the
deceased's
heart.</i>
<P>

<i>Further confrontations and disputes continued between persons of
middle-eastern appearance, Security Staff and other persons from
the
Tavern.</i>
<P>

<i>About 3.30 am, the police stopped a vehicle on Mary Street, Auburn, a short
distance from the Tavern.  The prisoner was in that vehicle
and was spoken to
by police.</i>
<P>

<i>The prisoner was interviewed by Detectives at Flemington Police Station on 5
May, 1998.  The prisoner declined to be interviewed any
further and declined to
participate in an identification parade.</i>
<P>

<i>The prisoner was arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased on 29
May 1998.</i>
<P>

<i>On 2 March 1999 Shadi Kouzaiha pleaded guilty to affray at the Burwood Local
Court.  He was placed on a recognisance for three years
and fined $600."</i>
<P>

3  	The above statement of facts was tendered on 21 September 1999.
Counsel confirmed when the prisoner came before the Court on
8 December 1999
for evidence and submissions on sentence that the above statement of facts was
an agreed statement.  However the
Crown tendered a number of statements from
police officers and witnesses to supplement that agreed statement and Mr
O'Loughlin called
the prisoner.
<P>

4  	There was, in the material tendered by the Crown, evidence that
may have indicated that the prisoner was with Shadi Kouzaiha
inside the tavern
when the confrontation occurred inside with the security officers but the Crown
made it clear that the Crown did
not assert for sentencing purposes that the
prisoner was inside the hotel.  I was asked to approach my task upon the basis
that the
prisoner became involved in events after Shadi Kouzaiha had been taken
outside by the security staff.
<P>

5  	The prisoner gave evidence on sentence which I now summarise.
The prisoner said he had gone to the tavern with friends but had
not been
allowed to enter the building because he had no identification to prove he was
over eighteen years of age.  He said that
he remained outside whilst his
friends were inside and this was for a period of three to three and a half
hours.  He claimed that
one of his friends gave him five Rohypnol tablets and
that he remembered that he had three of them.  He was uncertain whether he
had
all five.
<P>

6  	Whilst he was waiting in his friend's car he found an orange and
a pocket knife, and he said he left the car, taking the orange
and the knife
with him.  He had the orange and put the pocket knife in his pocket.  He said
that he saw somebody being dragged out
of the hotel.  He did not know at first
that this was his friend Shadi Kouzaiha but he said that his friend was being
"bashed" by
three people he described as "bouncers".
<P>

7  	The prisoner moved towards this group and he said that he saw
another person come out of the hotel and stumble.  This person
proved to be the
deceased.  According to the prisoner, having stumbled, the deceased stood up,
holding a piece of concrete or rock
in his hand.  According to the prisoner the
deceased came towards him and, indeed, the prisoner said that he was hit on the
chin
by the concrete or rock which the deceased was holding.  The prisoner drew
the knife and stabbed the deceased with it.  The prisoner
said he then threw
the knife away but he does not remember where.  No pocket knife such as the
prisoner described appears to have
been discovered.  There is in the material
tendered evidence that a particular knife was found in the roof gutter of the
hotel but
there is nothing to link that knife, which was not a pocket knife,
with the prisoner.
<P>

8  	I was not impressed with the evidence that the prisoner gave.  He
was asked about certain firearms offences to which I shall
refer again later.
The prisoner gave an explanation concerning those earlier offences of having
"found" a weapon as he was leaving
a snooker hall, which explanation I find
implausible.  Further, his version of the circumstances in which the deceased
sustained
his knife wound differed from an account attributed to him by Ms
Barrier, the psychologist, when she interviewed the prisoner on
11 November
1999, and generally I found the prisoner's evidence unconvincing.  Whilst the
prisoner maintained that before he stabbed
the deceased he did not notice six
young Lebanese men involved in the struggle, which I am satisfied was occurring
outside the tavern,
the evidence tendered by the Crown establishes their
presence at the scene, and I find that these men were involved in the struggle
outside the tavern before the prisoner used the knife.  Further, although the
prisoner asserted in his evidence that the deceased
approached him, this does
not accord with the agreed statement of facts in which it was stated that it
was the prisoner who approached
the deceased.  
<P>

9  	Hence I am not persuaded that the prisoner stabbed the deceased
precisely in the circumstances as he described them in his evidence.
 Indeed I
have very serious reservations as to his explanation as to how the knife came
to be in his pocket, but he maintained his
explanation in cross examination.
In any event, it seems to me that I should approach my task upon the basis that
the stabbing has
not been proved to have been premeditated.  I have
reservations also about the prisoner's assertions that the deceased struck him
with a rock or concrete, but ultimately nothing really turns upon this, because
the prisoner acknowledged in cross examination that
he perceived the deceased
to be intoxicated and no threat to his well being.  The prisoner admitted that
he could have made good
his escape and could have avoided any confrontation
with the deceased simply by turning away.  There was no good reason for the
prisoner
to have become involved in what was happening outside the hotel in the
first place, and there was no excuse for him drawing out a
knife, whatever be
the reason it was in his possession.
<P>

10  	In accepting the plea to manslaughter the Crown indicated that
it did so upon the basis that the act of the accused causing
death was an
unlawful and dangerous act.  The acceptance of the plea to manslaughter
involves an acceptance by the Crown that the
prisoner did not act with intent
to kill the deceased or to cause him serious bodily harm.  I must therefore
determine what is a
proper sentence upon the basis that the prisoner had no
such intent.  Rather he is to be sentenced upon the basis following <i>Wilson v
The Queen</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/31.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 31</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20174%20CLR%20313" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 174 CLR 313</a> that he committed an unlawful and dangerous
act that from the viewpoint of a reasonable person carried with it an
appreciable risk
of serious injury.
<P>

11  	The post mortem examination was conducted by Dr Bradhurst.  The
cause of death was a stab wound to the chest.  There was only
the one stab
wound and I refer to the post mortem report:
<P>

<i>"There was a 19 x 7 mm longitudinal stab wound on the lower left anterior
chest 105 mm to the left of the midline and 1.24 m from
the left heel.  This
skin entry wound had a 1 to 2 mm wide bevel along its lateral edge.  The stab
wound was 65 mm below the left
nipple.</i>
<P>

<i>The wound track passed posterior and medially to cause a 15 x 3 mm
longitudinal wound in the anterior left thoracic cage in the interspace
between
the 5th and 6th left ribs and cutting, for a distance of 5 mm, into the
cartilaginous part of the 6th rib.</i>
<P>

<i>The stab track then entered the lower anterior left side of the parietal
pericardium and caused a cut through the lower lateral edge
of the wall of the
right ventricle, this heart wound measuring 15 x 2 mm."</i>
<P>

12  	The crime of manslaughter attracts a maximum penalty under the
<i>Crimes Act</i> of twenty-five years penal servitude and the courts have
emphasised that the starting point in determining an appropriate sentence
must
be to recognise that a human life has been taken.  In <i>R v Blacklidge</i>
(unreported, NSWCCA, 12 December 1995) Gleeson CJ said at p 4:
<P>

<i>"...the courts have repeatedly stressed that what is involved in every case
of manslaughter is the felonious taking of a human life.
 That is the starting
point for a consideration of the appropriate penalty, and a key element in the
assessment of the gravity of
the objective circumstances of the case.  (R v
Dodd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2057%20A%20Crim%20R%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 57 A Crim R 349</a>; R v Hill  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%203%20A%20Crim%20R%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 3 A Crim R 397</a> at 402)"</i>
<P>

13  	The fact that a knife was used in the commission of this offence
is a significant feature of the crime.  The Court of Criminal
Appeal has
stressed many times the gravity with which the use of a knife as a weapon is to
be regarded:  (see, for example, <i>Rothapfel</i> (unreported, NSWCCA, 4 August
1992)).  The prisoner knifed an intoxicated man who he perceived as no real
threat to his well being.
 The court's abhorrence of the use of a knife as a
weapon and the element of deterrence must be given appropriate recognition in
the sentence I impose.
<P>

14  	Viewed objectively I must regard this as a serious offence.
There is, moreover, an aggravating feature, namely that this offence
was
committed whilst the prisoner was on bail.
<P>

15  	Although the prisoner is still only a young man twenty years of
age he has a previous criminal history.  In February 1998 he
came before the
court charged with two firearms offences to which I made earlier reference.
These offences related to possessing
a loaded firearm and possessing an
unauthorised firearm.  On the day he went before the court in February 1998 he
was also charged
with intimidating a police officer in the execution of his
duty.  The prisoner was given bail on that date for these three offences
and
the offence for which he is now to be punished was committed whilst he was on
bail.  One of the conditions of the bail imposed
a curfew on him and the
prisoner was supposed to be at home with his parents between the hours of 8.00
pm and 6.00 am.  In being
outside this tavern the prisoner was defying the
curfew condition.
<P>

16  	I add that the prisoner's criminal history began in May 1996
when he was before the Children's Court charged with robbery.
 There were other
offences recorded on his criminal history before he was charged with the
offences for which he first came before
the Burwood Local Court in February
1998.  However such other offences assume no particular significance in the
present context.
<P>

17  	The prisoner has been in custody continuously since 29 May 1998.
On 29 May 1998 the prisoner commenced a fixed term of imprisonment
of one month
for the offence of intimidating a police officer and he subsequently served a
further term of imprisonment of three
months and two weeks for the firearms
offences previously mentioned.  (The magistrate in the Local Court sentenced
him to a fixed
term of four months on each firearms' charge, with the sentences
to be served concurrently, but the District Court reduced these
concurrent
sentences by two weeks).  The result is that the prisoner has been in custody
since 29 May 1998 exclusively for the manslaughter
offence, other than for a
period aggregating four months and two weeks.  This must be taken into account
in order to arrive at an
appropriate sentence.
<P>

18  	The prisoner is to be given credit for the plea of guilty.  I
accept that the prisoner pleaded guilty to this crime of manslaughter
at the
first available opportunity, that is to say upon the first occasion that the
Crown indicated a willingness to accept the plea
in satisfaction of an
indictment that charged him with murder.  I am prepared to accept the
prisoner's expression of contrition and
I accept Mr O'Loughlin's submission
that since the prosecution case depended upon identification evidence, a
conviction could not
have been regarded as certain.  Moreover, by his plea, the
prisoner has saved considerable time and expense.  So it is, with the
above
considerations in mind, the plea of guilty is to be taken into account in the
prisoner's favour.
<P>

19  	Although it would seem the prisoner comes from a stable family
background, he turned his back on this environment and ran away
from home at
the age of fifteen, adopting the view that his parents were too strict with
him.  He fell into bad company and became
a drug user.  He conceded in his
evidence before this Court that he has used cannabis, to which he became an
addicted daily user,
and he has also used cocaine, ecstasy, heroin and, in the
month before the offence, anabolic steroids, before trying Rohypnol on
the
evening he stabbed the deceased.
<P>

20  	Since he has been in custody the prisoner said he has not been
using drugs and a favourable report from a drug and alcohol
worker was tendered
in the prisoner's case.  I am prepared to accept, as the evidence given by the
prisoner's mother indicates, that
the prisoner has family willing to support
him when eventually he is realised from custody.  The prisoner has expressed a
desire
to pursue a career in real estate and his mother has indicated that
financial support will be provided for him to pursue this venture.
 A course of
study is available to him through the TAFE Granville College.  Mr O'Loughlin
tendered a number of references.  Three
of these come from sources whose
appraisal of the prisoner is out of step with his criminal history and his
acknowledged drug abuse.
 I am not assisted by these references.  There is,
however, a letter from a welfare officer with the New South Wales Lebanese
Community,
and this person has seen the prisoner since he has been in custody.
According to this referee, the prisoner has been helpful to her
in her task of
counselling Arabic-speaking people in custody.  This is to the prisoner's
credit.
<P>

21  	Plainly the prisoner has a long way to go in this regard, but
for present purposes I am prepared to approach this case upon
the basis that
there is some hope that the prisoner can be rehabilitated.  He will need an
extended period of supervision when he
is released to assist in his
rehabilitation and to assist him to stay off drugs.  He is still a young man
and the continuous period
during which he has been in prison since May 1998 is
his first period in prison.  For this combination of reasons I find special
circumstances for the purpose of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></i>.
<P>

22  	Mr O'Loughlin tendered a report from Ms Barrier, the
psychologist who assessed the prisoner on 11 November 1999.  Her assessment
was
that the prisoner has limited intellectual capacity and that his full scale IQ
places him in the lowest five percent of the general
population.  Ms Barrier
concluded her report:
<P>

<i>"At his level of ability he would [sic] a concrete thinker and it would be
more difficult for him than the average person to deal
with psychological and
emotional issues which require the developmental and utilisation of abstract
concepts.  His personality test
results show him to be someone who whilst
maintaining a flimsy bravado, would anxiously seek reassurance from his
particular peer
group and relate in a generally obsequious and self sacrificing
manner.  It is likely this young man was flattered to be allowed
to be part of
an older group and particularly one he saw as unfettered by parental and social
obligations.</i>
<P>

<i>Whilst Bassam began his time in custody exhibiting rebellious acting out
behaviour, he has settled.  He is undertaking further educational
and
vocational training, has severed contact with his former associates and is
grateful for the ongoing support of his extended family."</i>
<P>

23  	Mr O'Loughlin asked me to take into account the psychologist's
assessment for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></i>, and I do
so.
<P>

24  	In the course of their submissions counsel have taken me to a
number of decisions dealing with sentences imposed for the crime
of
manslaughter:  in <i>Bryant</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/181.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCCA 181</a> the Court of Criminal Appeal
dismissed an appeal against a sentence of ten years penal servitude with a
minimum term of six and half
years and an additional term of three and a half
years.  This was a case of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act and I
observe
was a case where the offender had been convicted by a jury of
manslaughter after being tried for murder.  Hence there was no element
in that
case of credit to be given for a plea of guilty.  In the judgment of the Chief
Justice, with whom the other members of the
court agreed, his Honour said (at
para 23):
<P>

<i>"On the basis of the material before the court it appears that the sentence
imposed in this case is at the top of the range in sentences
for this
offence."</i>
<P>

25  	In <i>Lewis</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/131.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 131</a>, the head sentence was nine
years penal servitude with a minimum term of six years and an additional term
of three years; in <i>Papandrea</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/978.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 978</a> the head sentence was nine
years penal servitude with a minimum term of six years and an additional term
of three years; in <i>Owen</i> (unreported, NSWCCA, 5 June 1997) the appeal
against a total sentence of eight a half years penal servitude with a minimum
term of
four and a half years was dismissed; in <i>Horton</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/983.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 983</a>
the head sentence was eight years penal servitude with a minimum term of five
years; in <i>Taouk</i> (unreported, NSWCCA, 20 March 1992) the sentencing judge
considered appropriate a head sentence of seven years with a minimum term
of
five years.  The Court of Criminal Appeal declined to disturb the head sentence
but lowered the minimum term.  In <i>Wright</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/1087.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 1087</a> the head
sentence was seven years penal servitude with a minimum term of four years.  In
<i>Azar</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=56%20A%20Crim%20R%20414" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">56 A Crim 414</a> the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed an appeal
against sentence where the head sentence was six years with a minimum term of
four
and half years.  In <i>Khouzami</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/979.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 979</a> the sentence was one
of five years penal servitude with a minimum term of three years.  In
<i>Robson</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/855.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 855</a> the head sentence was five years penal servitude
with a minimum term of three years.  In <i>Lam</i> (unreported, NSWCCA, 20
March 1998) the head sentence was one of five years with a minimum term of
three years.  In <i>Sofokleous</i> (unreported, NSWCCA, 13 December 1993) an
appeal was dismissed against a head sentence of four years penal servitude with
a minimum
term of three years.  I observe though that in his judgment in this
case, with which the other members of the court agreed, Kirby
P described the
sentence as <i>"an extremely light sentence"</i>.  In <i>Grenenger</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/380.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999]
NSWSC 380</a> the head sentence was one of three years with a minimum term of one a
half years.
<P>

26  	I have considered each of the above cases.  It would not be
useful to record the objective and subjective features of them
here.  They vary
greatly in their individual circumstances as the range of sentences indicates.
Ultimately I am not greatly assisted
by sentences imposed on other offenders
where the crime of manslaughter has been committed.  So much depends upon the
particular
features of the particular case, as has frequently been emphasised
at first instance and on appeal by judges of this court.  For
instance, in
<i>Blacklidge</i> (supra) Gleeson CJ said at p 4:
<P>

<i>"It has long been recognised that the circumstances which may give rise to a
conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range
of degrees of
culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established
sentencing tariff which can be applied
to such cases.  Of all crimes,
manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting
culpability."</i>
<P>

27  	Nevertheless, whilst recognising what was said in
<i>Blacklidge</i> I cannot ignore the indications of a range, albeit so wide,
as pointed to by those cases to which I have made specific reference.
<P>

28  	I must closely consider the objective and the subjective
features of this case in order to fix a sentence appropriate to this
crime.
<P>

29  	The Crown tendered a Victim Impact Statement from the deceased's
former wife, describing the way in which this victim and the
children of her
union with the deceased have suffered by reason of the untimely death of the
deceased.  That statement has been received
pursuant to s 23C of the
<i>Criminal Procedure Act</i>.  In <i>R v Previtera</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2094%20A%20Crim%20R%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 94 A Crim R 76</a>
it was determined that it is not appropriate to take account of the subject
matter of such a statement in order to arrive at a sentence.
 However, the
statement indicates some of the suffering this killing has caused, and the
Court expresses its condolences to those
victims identified in the statement.
It is to be hoped that the grief these victims have experienced and are no
doubt still experiencing
will diminish as time goes by.
<P>

30  	I have concluded that I should set a total sentence of eight
years six months penal servitude in this case.  Because of the
lengthy period
the prisoner has already been in prison solely for this crime, I am going to
backdate the sentence.  I note that after
the term served for intimidating a
police officer expired there was a period of one month served referable only to
this manslaughter
offence before the sentences in respect of the firearms'
offences commenced.  I propose therefore to backdate the sentence to begin
on
13 October 1998 which is one month before the prisoner was due to be released
for the firearm's offences.  Because of the special
circumstances I have found,
I fix a minimum term of five years six months and an additional term of three
years.
<P>

31  	Accordingly, I sentence the prisoner to a total sentence of
eight years six months penal servitude and I set a minimum term
of five years
six months penal servitude commencing on 13 October 1998 and to expire on 12
April 2004.  He will serve an additional
term of three years penal servitude to
commence on 13 April 2004 and to expire on 12 April 2007.  I specify 13 April
2004 as the
first date upon which the prisoner is to be eligible for release on
parole.
