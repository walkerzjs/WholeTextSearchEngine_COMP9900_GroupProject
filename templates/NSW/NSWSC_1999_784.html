<b>MASTER McLAUGHLIN</b>
<P>

<i>Monday, 26 July 1999</i>
<P>

<b>1028/98	ANTHONY CHARLES RICHARDSON   -v-   ELAINE MARGARET HOUGH</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b> There is presently before me a notice of
motion filed by the defendant, Elaine Margaret Hough, on 9 July 1999.  By that
notice of
motion the defendant seeks an order pursuant to section 100 of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</i> 1970</a> that the Registrar in Equity or a Deputy
Registrar in Equity be appointed to execute for and on behalf of the plaintiff
all documents
that are necessary so as to cause the defendant to be paid from
the proceeds of Westpac Banking Corporation account number 11-1435
held at the
Kiama Branch under the account name "Gearns and Garside and John R Quinn &amp;
Co in trust for Hough and Richardson"
as are payable to the defendant in
accordance with orders made in this Court on 12 November 1998.  
<P>

2   	In support of that notice of motion there have been filed
two affidavits by John Peter Littrich, sworn respectively on 8 July
1999 and 19
July 1999.  Mr Littrich is the solicitor for the defendant.  In those
affidavits he sets forth evidence of various communications
with John R Quinn
&amp; Co, the solicitors for the plaintiff, Anthony Charles Richardson,
concerning the amount in the bank account
which is the subject of the present
application.
<P>

3   	For the purposes of the present application it is
unnecessary for me to set forth in detail the procedural history of this
matter. Suffice it to say that the amount which is in the bank account, the
subject of the present application, represents the net
proceeds of sale of a
certain property which was sold pursuant to orders of the Court made on 6 June
1996.  Subsequently orders were
made that those net proceeds be held for the
plaintiff as to 4287 shares and for the defendant as to 4587 shares. 
<P>

4   	The solicitor for the plaintiff has not been able to obtain
specific instructions from his client for the solicitor to sign
a withdrawal
form in respect to the moneys which are payable to the defendant.  Indeed it
would appear that the plaintiff has personally
communicated with the solicitor
for the defendant and has expressed his opposition to the withdrawal of those
moneys in accordance
with the orders of the Court.
<P>

5   	I am satisfied that the defendant is entitled to have the
withdrawal form signed by the Registrar in Equity, to enable the
orders of the
court to be carried into effect.
<P>

6   	The provisions of section 100 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court
Act</a></i> are framed in wide language and are such as to encompass the execution
of documents of the nature which the defendant has requested
the plaintiff
through his solicitor to sign.  Unless the Court makes an order of the nature
presently sought the orders of the Court
concerning the disposition of the
moneys in this bank account will be rendered nugatory.
<P>

7   	I make the following orders:
<P>

(1)	I make an order as in paragraph 1 of the notice of motion filed by the
defendant on 9 July 1999.
<P>

(2)	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the defendant of the aforesaid
notice of motion.
<P>

(3)	I grant leave to the defendant to proceed forthwith to the assessment of
the foregoing costs.
<P>
