<b><u>115918/98 NOEL HEYWOOD WILLIAMS v WILLIAM BERNARD PATRICK LAWSON &amp; 2
ORS (THE ESTATE OF DOUGLAS KEITH CALLAGHAN)</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  Douglas Keith Callaghan died on 5
August 1998 aged eighty-four.   He left a will dated 4 May 1988 which appointed
the plaintiff,
Mr Williams, and his solicitor Mr Dalziel, as executors, gave
his property at Bathurst to his housekeeper Josephine Nairne, and gave
the
residue of the estate in equal shares to the National Heart Foundation of
Australia and the New South Wales State Cancer Council.
<P>

2   	By a codicil to that will dated 26 March 1990, he expressed
the wish that William Bernard Patrick Lawson, who is the first
defendant in
these proceedings and the cross-claimant, be engaged by his trustees to advise
them on any matters relating to the supply
and reticulation of water and
fencing on his rural properties.  Otherwise he confirmed his will.  
<P>

3   	Mr Dalziel, as I have said, is a solicitor and had acted
for the deceased for a long time.  He, however, renounced probate.
 Mr Williams
applied for a grant of probate of the will and codicil and disclosed in
accordance with the rules that there were documents
dated 22 April 1996 and 22
July 1998 which may have been documents embodying the testamentary intentions
of the deceased, in this
case, to amend his formal documents, namely the will
and codicil.  The documents are written on each side of one piece of paper
which
appears to have been torn from a journal.  It is clear that part of the
full page has been torn off but I do not think that anything
turns on that.
<P>

4   	The first document has a date at the top "Monday April 22
1996".  After that appears the words "Wed. July 22/98.  See over".
 It is
obvious those words were added at a later date. The document then says:
<P>

I Douglas Keith Callaghan make this order in the event of my death, and in
consideration of the affairs of my estate, William Bernard
Patrick Lawson
(known as 'Bill') is to be paid $800 per week to attend to the work involved in
the disposal of the said estate.
<P>

Signed 
<P>

D K Callaghan.
<P>

5   	At the foot of the document after the signature of the
deceased there is a date "Oct. 5th 1996. Attention  G Dalziel".  It
is obvious
there was something written below that which has been torn off and it is
equally clear that the date 5 October 1996 could
not be part of the document
admitted to probate.  Apart from that, I do not think that anything turns on
it.
<P>

6   	On the reverse side of this piece of paper is the other
document which is headed "Wed. July 22-98" in the following terms:
<P>

All the Perthville property is bequeathed to the aforementioned W B P Lawson to
have and to hold - and he is to be made a full executor
in place of D L Dalziel
who is to step down from this position but is to remain solicitor to the
estate.
<P>

D K Callaghan.
<P>

DOUGLAS KEITH CALLAGHAN."
<P>

7   	The deceased was a wealthy man who at the date of his death
had assets estimated to be worth $3,300,000.  Included in those
figures are the
Bathurst home of $180,000 and the Perthville property of $1,000,000.  It is
really the Perthville property which
is the subject of the contest in this
action before me.
<P>

8   	The matter falls to be decided under s 18A of the Wills
Probate Administration Act 1898.  For a document to be admitted to
probate
under that section there must be:
<P>

1.	A document.
<P>

2.	That document must purport to state testamentary intentions of the deceased,
or purport to record the testamentary intentions
of the deceased.
<P>

3.	The document must be intended at the time of signing that document or at
some later particular time without more to constitute
the will of the deceased
or an amendment to the will of the deceased.
<P>

9   	So far as this third matter is concerned, there must be an
intention that the document become of immediate operation, not that
it will
constitute a will at some later undetermined time.
<P>

10   	The evidence which is relevant to determine this question
is perhaps more convincing than is sometimes available in cases
of this kind.
Section 18A provides that it is possible when determining the intention to
consider statements made by the deceased,
and any other evidence relating to
the manner of execution or testamentary intentions which may assist in working
out whether or
not the court should be satisfied that the deceased person
intended the document to operate as a will.
<P>

11   	Mr Lawson was an old friend of the deceased.   Without
going into the details of their long relationship, he had worked with
him on
his properties over a long period of time, but normally on weekends or when he
had some time off from his ordinary work as
a field supervisor with the
Department of Lands and Water Conservation.  It is perfectly clear that he and
the deceased were good
friends and other witnesses attest to that.  There is
evidence of conversations between Mr Lawson and the deceased discussing the
intentions of the deceased to leave him the Perthville property, or at least
part of it, at some time.
<P>

12   	There is evidence that just prior to his death there was a
conversation about old ploughs when Mr Lawson asked the deceased
not sell them
as he would like to have them if he eventually got "my own place" and the
deceased said to him, "Am I going to leave
you this place or not?"  Later on
the deceased had said to him, "I will tell you one thing, Mr Billy Lawson, you
are going to need
a lot of capital to run this place", and he replied, "Is that
right?", to which the deceased said, "Yes, that's right."
<P>

13   	There was another occasion apparently some weeks before
the conversation to which I have just referred when the deceased said
to Mr
Lawson that they had better have a good talk about things because he, meaning
the deceased, had only got about five years left.
<P>

14   	There is also evidence which relates to the provision of
the $800 per week if Mr Lawson attended to work in connection with
the disposal
of the property, a conversation when the deceased asked him whether he would be
willing to do this and he had said that
he would, and the deceased said at the
end, "Do you think $800 a week will be enough?" to which Mr Lawson had said,
"Yes, that should
cover me".
<P>

15   	Probably the most crucial evidence is that given by Mr
John Burke in his affidavits.  He deposes to conversations with the
deceased
about Lawson running the property when he had died, and another conversation
when the deceased told him about an argument
he had had with Mr Dalziel over
the land which he was selling to the council.  He said that the year before he
had died the deceased
had said to him one day, "I am leaving the Perthville
property to Bill and you will have to deal with him in relation to clay". 
This
conversation took place because Mr Burke carted clay from the Perthville
property to the Bathurst brickworks and subsequently
when that company was
taken over, to CSR.
<P>

16   	Mr Burke said that not long before the deceased's death he
was at the other property, namely, the Eglinton property, when
the deceased
handed him the handwritten note which is sought to be admitted to probate and
said to him, "Read this", and that after
he had read both sides of the document
the deceased said, "Well, that is what is happening now.  I want Billy to have
the place.
 He will have to spend a few bob and fight for the place if he wants
it".  In my view those last words related to the need to expend
substantial
moneys on the property rather than fighting with anybody about keeping it.
<P>

17   	There is also evidence from a Mr Barnes who stated that he
had been told by the deceased, clearly earlier than the July 1998
date, that he
would not sell part of the property to him, Barnes, because, "If I did I would
be doing a mate of yours out of his
inheritance. This will end up being Bill's
property at some time".  I consider that this evidence of intention is relevant
to show
that the deceased had in mind that he would leave the Perthville
property to Mr Lawson and that, together with the document which
came into
existence after this express intention, is strong evidence that it was intended
to be a document which would operate from
its date as expressing what the
deceased intended from his death.
<P>

18   	It is now necessary to state how the document was found.
The deceased  was apparently late home a few days before his death
and his
housekeeper contacted Mr Lawson, and Lawson said that he would go  to look for
him. He then went out to the property, found
the deceased's truck and dogs
running around, looked in the shed and found the deceased lying on the floor,
obviously very seriously
ill. He summoned the ambulance and the deceased went
to hospital.  The next day Mr Lawson and Mr Stocks, who was also a good friend
of the deceased, decided that in view of the serious illness of the deceased
they should endeavour to get in touch with a number
of people whom they thought
should know of his serious illness.  They therefore went out to the farm to try
and find the telephone
numbers of those people.  They looked in the box on the
back of the truck and they also looked through some documents which were
in
what is described as pigeon holes in a cabinet against one of the walls of the
shed.
<P>

19   	The documents, which for the most part appear to have been
records of cattle sales, cattle purchases, equipment purchases
and the like,
were put on the table and amongst those documents appeared the document which
is now sought to have admitted to probate.
 Mr Stocks read the document to Mr
Lawson who, it is clear, did not know of its existence.  Mr Stocks retained the
document but after
Mr Callaghan died he took it to Mr Dalziel when there was a
meeting there with Mr Lawson,  Mr Dalziel and Mr Williams.
<P>

20   	Counsel for the charities says that this is one of the
indications that the document was not treated by the deceased as a
document
which was operative, or a document which was a serious document because it was
mixed up with what might be described as
ordinary farm records.  He also says
that the conversations, and even the conversation with Mr Burke, are not
sufficient to show
intention by the deceased that this document was to operate
as an amendment to his will.
<P>

21   	For the reasons for the most part put forward by counsel
for the cross-claimant I have come to the opposite conclusion.  The
documents
are in relatively formal terms.  They use legal terms and the later one removes
the executor, and there is some reason
given for this, although I am not to be
taken as saying there is any justification for this.  The documents are signed
and on their
face appear to be quite formally signed.  They clearly embody what
the deceased intended to happen and what he had stated would happen
to other
persons on many occasions.
<P>

22   	There is also evidence in the expression which was used by
the deceased when he showed the document to Mr Burke, namely, "Read
this.
Well, that is what is happening now", which would indicate that the document
was considered by the deceased to have present
effect.  On that basis, in my
view, the document ought to be admitted to probate and I will make the
necessary orders for that.
<P>

23   	I should add that if there were any doubt about the
document of 22 April 1996 as being a testamentary instrument and in effect
all
that it does is to express a wish, although it is said to be an order, the fact
is that this document has been incorporated by
a reference in the later
document and on that basis alone it ought to be admitted to probate.
<P>

24   	I make the orders as sought in paragraphs (i) to (iv) of
the cross-claim.  I order the costs of all parties be paid out of
the estate,
those of the plaintiff and the cross-claimant on an indemnity basis pursuant to
Pt 52A r 37A of the rules.
<P>

25   	The exhibits, other than the testamentary documents, can
be returned.
