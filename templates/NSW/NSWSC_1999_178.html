<b><u>70099/98 - REGINA v Edward William SZKUDELSKI</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  Edward William Szkudelski pleaded guilty to being an
accessory after the fact on 20 June 1998 of a murder committed by Pieter Egbert
Helmhout and Mark William Helmhout.
<P>

2	The facts may be summarised as follows.  On Friday night 19 June 1998 in a
flat in Queanbeyan a wake was being held for a recently
deceased man, John
Helmhout.  The flat was occupied by the brother of the dead man, Mark William
Helmhout.  Those present included
Mark Helmhout, Pieter Helmhout, Paul Harris
and the prisoner.  They were drinking heavily or smoking cannabis.  Mr Harris,
Peter
Helmhout and the prisoner were well under the influence of drink.
<P>

3	Not long after midnight Pieter Helmhout hit Mr Harris in the face with the
back of his hand.  Most of the guests left and there
were left behind Mr
Harris, the two Helmhout, Joanne Delly, the wife of Mark Helmhout, Deborah
Davidson and the prisoner.  They were
all in the kitchen.
<P>

4	Pieter Helmhout then resumed his assault on Mr Harris, punching him in the
head, and was joined by Mark Helmhout.
<P>

5	Pieter Helmhout put a belt around Mr Harris' neck and pulled him to the floor
and whilst they had him face down on the floor Pieter
and Mark Helmhout
strangled him by means of the belt and an electrical cord.  Mr Harris died.
Davidson took his wallet.
<P>

6	The two Helmhout brothers wrapped Mr Harris' body and the ligatures in
bedding and carried them to Mark Helmhout's vehicle which
was parked underneath
the unit.  The prisoner and Davidson helped them.  Mark Helmhout drove towards
Canberra and on the way handed
Mr Harris' wallet to the prisoner, who threw it
out of the vehicle.  They continued on to Fyshwick where the Helmhout brothers
and
the prisoner took the body out of the boot and dumped it in a pine grove.
Mark Helmhout then drove to another Canberra suburb and
stopped while the
bedding, the ligatures and some items of clothing Mr Harris had worn were
dumped into the Molonglo River.  Mark
Helmhout then drove Pieter Helmhout and
the prisoner back to the flat where Mr Harris had been killed.
<P>

7	Mark Helmhout went to bed with his wife and Pieter fell asleep.  The prisoner
remained in the kitchen, talking and drinking with
Davidson.  She eventually
fell asleep at about 5.20 am.
<P>

8	The prisoner left the unit straight away and went to another flat in the same
block in an attempt to rouse the occupants, whom
he knew.  When he was
unsuccessful he went to the public telephone box near the flats and telephoned
the Queanbeyan police station.
<P>

9	He was still at the telephone box when the police attended and they took him
to the Queanbeyan police station.  They could see
that he had blood on both his
hands and on his shoes.  He took the police to the Molonglo River, where the
bedding and the other
items had been dumped, and then to the place where Mr
Harris' body had been left.  He voluntarily underwent an interview by
Australian
Federal Police and made taped admissions about the matter.
<P>

10	At about 8.30 am on the same day police went to the unit and arrested the
two Helmhout brothers and Davidson.  Certain items
were taken from the unit as
evidence.
<P>

11	At about 1 pm on the same day the prisoner was interviewed at the Queanbeyan
police station and an electronic record was made
of what was said.  The
prisoner made full admissions about his involvement in the matter.  A
post-mortem examination of the body
of Mr Harris showed that he had a blood
alcohol reading at the time of death of 0.400 grams per 100 millilitres of
blood and that
he had died from asphyxia caused by strangulation.  There was
evidence of severe blunt trauma to the head, chest and other parts
of the
body.
<P>

12	The police set about charging the other offenders and preparing a brief for
court.  The prisoner appeared a number of times at
the Local Court at
Queanbeyan and it was indicated that he would plead guilty.  Ultimately on 11
November 1998 he was committed for
sentence to this Court.  His first
appearance was on 5 February 1999 and he pleaded guilty to the charge.  On the
same day he signed
a written undertaking to the Director of Public Prosecutions
to give evidence at any proceedings, including any appeal and retrial,
against
Peter Helmhout, Mark Helmhout, Deborah Davidson and Joanne Delly for offences
arising out of the murder of Mr Harris.  He
further undertook to give active
co-operation, including the giving of evidence truthfully and frankly in
accordance with a statement
that he had made on 20 June 1998.  That was a
reference to the typed record of the electronically recorded interview the
prisoner
underwent at Queanbeyan police station.
<P>

13	The Crown tendered a large body of statements of witnesses and other
documents.  It is clear from them that the prisoner had
had a good deal to
drink before his arrival at the flat on 19 June 1998.  He had had some sort of
an argument with his wife and had
been forced to leave home and go to a friend
in a flat in the same block as the one in which the murder took place.  During
the evening
he was seen at a nearby club by a person who knew him well and
thought he was more badly affected by alcohol than he had ever seen
before.
<P>

14	The Helmhout brothers seemed to have started their attack on the deceased
without warning.  I think that the prisoner was telling
the truth when he told
the police that during the attack he was trying to think of a way to get out of
the flat and go home but that
they looked at him and that Mark Helmhout said
that he was not going anywhere, he was staying there.  I think that he remained
out
of fear.  He played no part in the attack.  He assisted the others to
dispose of the body because he was afraid of what they might
do if he did not.
I am satisfied that he escaped from their presence at the earliest possible
opportunity.  If he had left earlier
than he did, at least one person would
have known of the fact and raised the alarm.  As soon as he escaped he called
the police and
waited for them to come.  He told them everything he knew and
gave them every assistance he could.
<P>

15	S 442B Crimes Act provides that a court passing sentence on a person
convicted of an offence may reduce the sentence it would
otherwise impose
having regard to the degree to which the person has assisted or undertaken to
assist law enforcement authorities
in the detection or investigation of
proceedings relating to the offence or other offences.  By subs (3) the court
is required to
consider a number of matters, including the significance and
usefulness of the assistance to the authorities concerned, the truthfulness,
completeness and reliability of the information or evidence provided, the
nature and extent of the assistance or promised assistance,
the timeliness of
the assistance or undertaking to assist, whether the offender will suffer
harsher custodial conditions, whether
the assistance or promised assistance
concerns the offence for which the offender is being sentenced or an unrelated
offence and
the likelihood that the offender will commit further offences after
release.
<P>

16	Detective Sergeant Nixon, the officer in charge of the investigation, gave
evidence, as a result of which I am satisfied that
the assistance given and to
be given by the prisoner must be valued very highly.  The deceased was no
stranger in Queanbeyan and
investigations would presumably have established
that he was present at the wake on the night of his death, but no more can be
said
than that without the evidence of the prisoner.
<P>

17	I am satisfied that the information given and evidence to be provided by the
prisoner is true, complete and reliable and amounts
to the most the prisoner
could do.  His assistance was offered at the earliest possible moment.
<P>

18	I think because of the nature of the case that after he has given his
evidence the prisoner will be at risk of attack from the
interests of those
against whom he will give evidence.
<P>

19	All these considerations lead to the conclusion that the prisoner must be
allowed a large discount from the sentence which would
otherwise be
appropriate.
<P>

20	The prisoner was born on 19 August 1958.  He lives with his de facto wife in
Queanbeyan and works as a plasterer.  He has a criminal
history.  After some
short experience in the Children's Court, which was so long ago that I regard
it as irrelevant, the prisoner
has been dealt with in Magistrates' and Local
Courts on a number of occasions.  Between 1984 and 1997 he was dealt with for
ten offences.
 All appear to have been related to or to have arisen out of his
consumption of alcohol.  They were mostly offences of violence or
offensive
conduct.  Some involved the possession of firearms.
<P>

21	Mr Ken Mayes, Unit Leader of the Queanbeyan District Office of the
Department of Corrective Services, provided a pre-sentence
report for the
Court.  Mr Mayes confirms that the offences the prisoner has committed are
alcohol related.  His previous contact
with the Corrective Services Department
has been satisfactory and he has successfully completed two community service
orders, totalling
450 hours.  He also completed a 20 hour fine default
order.
<P>

22	He moved to Queanbeyan in 1992 soon after his release from a Victorian
Correctional Centre.  For the past four years he has maintained
what is
described as an unstable relationship with his current partner.  Both drink to
excess and there is frequent conflict.
<P>

23	He has a favourable employment history and his present employer says that he
is reliable and responsible.  There is a possibility
of more permanent
employment in the future.
<P>

24	The prisoner acknowledges that alcohol abuse was a factor in the offence.
He told Mr Mayes that he was subject of intimidation
from the Helmhout brothers
and that he assisted in the removal of the body because he feared for his own
life.  I accept that as
the truth.
<P>

25	He acknowledges that alcohol abuse has been a major factor in his offences
over the years.  When a pre-sentence report was prepared
in September 1997 he
was referred for an alcohol assessment.  Counselling was offered, but he
declined to participate, stating that
he intended to limit his consumption and
did not require the offered assistance.
<P>

26	There is some sign that his attitude has changed.  He has established
contact with a Salvation Army officer in Queanbeyan who
has experience in
alcohol rehabilitation.  That officer is supporting and encouraging the
prisoner and is prepared to counsel him
professionally if requested.
<P>

27	Mr Mayes considers the prisoner suitable for a further community service
order but in view of the need to come to grips with
the prisoner's alcohol
abuse, which has constantly contributed to repeat offending, suggests that any
order be made subject to a
condition that he accept the supervision of the
Probation and Parole Service, particularly in relation to alcohol
counselling.
<P>

28	Mr Mayes considers the prisoner suitable for periodic detention but points
out, with some justification I think, that it would
be dangerous for the
prisoner to have to report to an institution at regular intervals which could
provide only dormitory accommodation.
<P>

29	The Court received a report from Dr William Lucas, psychiatrist.  Dr Lucas
thought that there was no psychiatric diagnosis apart
from alcohol abuse and
probably alcohol dependence.  In the late 1980s the prisoner was involved in a
motor vehicle accident in Victoria
and suffered serious head injuries.  He was
unconscious for five days and lost his left eye.  He developed a problem with
balance,
but that does not now affect his work.  Dr Lucas thought it possible
that a degree of brain damage had occurred, but that it was
not likely to be
gross.
<P>

30	The prisoner has no history of psychiatric disorder and does not require
psychiatric treatment.  Dr Lucas thinks that he needs
counselling for his
alcohol abuse.
<P>

31	The prisoner himself gave evidence and confirmed to the Court his
willingness to abide by his undertaking to assist the prosecuting
authorities.
He also said that if the Court as part of his sentence made it a condition that
he attend alcohol counselling he would
fulfil that condition.  I accept his
assurance about that.
<P>

32	The Crown has very fairly acknowledged the danger which would be presented
if a sentence of full-time or periodic detention were
imposed and has also
submitted that the Court will not fall into appealable error if it imposes a
sentence of less than full-time
or periodic detention.
<P>

33	A combination of factors makes this offence one of the least serious of its
type to my mind.  They are the fact that the prisoner
was accidentally present
on premises where the murder was committed without warning.  He played no part
in the attack.  He went along
with the co-offenders under the influence of the
threat, which he was entitled to take seriously, but left their presence and
raised
the alarm as soon as he could safely do so.
<P>

34	The combination of these considerations leads me to the conclusion that I
should not impose a sentence of detention.  I intend
to make an order which
will give the prisoner the opportunity and the encouragement to fulfil the need
which he has now recognised
to manage his consumption of alcohol and his
behaviour in society.
<P>

35	I have chosen the option that I have because it will permit the prisoner to
be supervised for a substantially longer period than
would be the case if I
made a work order.
<P>

36	Edward William Szkudelski, I defer passing sentence upon you and order your
release upon your entering into a recognisance without
surety in the sum of
$1,000 to be of good behaviour for three years and to come up for sentence if
called upon.
<P>

37	It will be a condition of your recognisance that you accept the supervision
of the Probation and Parole Service of the Department
of Corrective Services,
including but not limited to alcohol counselling and the management of your
propensity for violence when
you are intoxicated.
<P>

38	It will be a further condition that you report within seven days of your
release to the officer in charge of the Probation and
Parole Service in
Queanbeyan.
