THURSDAY 9 DECEMBER 1999
<P>

<b>4939/98	OAMPS LTD v ROBERT ARTHUR PORTER</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  Australian Securities and Investments Commission,
which is not a party to the litigation, has applied by Notice
of Motion for
orders under which access to, meaning inspection of documents referred to in a
subpoena be refused and the documents
be returned to it.  
<P>

2  	The subpoena was issued and served by the plaintiff on ASIC on 15
September 1999 and called for many documents which ASIC has
produced without
objection to inspection.  ASIC's application relates to cl.4 of the Schedule to
the subpoena which calls for "all
records of interview and transcripts of
examinations and/or interviews, howsoever described, conducted by ASIC with any
of the following
persons:" and names 18 persons.  ASIC has produced without
objection the records, transcripts or statements of most of those persons,
on
the principle that those persons have consented to production of the records,
and the claim for public interest immunity would
not be effective because they
are each entitled to have copies and provide them to the plaintiff.  For some
of the persons named
the plaintiff did not press for inspection. The persons
whose statements the plaintiff presses to inspect and ASIC resists are: Duncan
Glasgow, Richard Walker, Rodney Adler,
<P>

Barrie Loiterton, Ian Porter, Ian Hall and Gerry Connelly.
<P>

3  	The plaintiff's counsel said that he pressed for any records
other than two transcripts of examination relating to the defendant
Robert
Arthur Porter, but ASIC asserted that the documents already available for
inspection are all that fall within the description.
 There is no reason to
investigate further whether this response to the subpoena is correct and I do
not propose to do so.
<P>

4  	The claim to public interest immunity was supported by the
evidence of Mr AJ Orchard, who is ASIC's Director, Enforcement at
its Victorian
Regional Office.  His evidence shows that ASIC commenced and is still
undertaking an investigation into share transactions
which occurred on or about
30 June 1998 involving the parties to this litigation and that the
investigation was "based on a suspicion
that certain conduct by certain
persons, including the defendant, in connection with those transactions
involved offences under the
Corporations Law".  The events under investigation
plainly include events out of which the issues in the litigation arises.  The
investigation is not complete.  It has reached the point where the Commonwealth
Director of Public Prosecutions was briefed to advise
early in 1999, the DPP
has provided some advice on the basis of the material briefed, but has not
provided final advice. No prosecution
has been commenced.  
<P>

5  	All claims for public interest immunity are subject to judicial
determination, and documents in possession of a law enforcement
agency and
relating to an investigation do not belong to the class of documents relating
to policy and matters of national importance
which may be accorded protection
irrespective of their contents and merely because they fall within that class.
Documents of a law
enforcement agency, if they are to be within the immunity,
must be found to be so applying the test stated in<i> Alister v The Queen</i>
(1984) 154 CLR 404 at 412 by Gibbs CJ in which the public interest questions
involved in producing the documents or on the other
hand not making material
evidence available have to be balanced.  The law was referred to and, for
present purposes restated in the
judgment of Lockhart J in <i>Zarro &amp; Ors v
Australian Securities Commission</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2036%20FCR%2040" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 36 FCR 40</a> at 44 to 46 and also in
his Honour's judgment in <i>Somerville v Australian Securities Commission</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2060%20FCR%20319" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 60 FCR 319</a> at 330-331.
<P>

6  	In Spargos Mining NL &amp; Anor v Standard Chartered Aust. Ltd
&amp; Ors (No. 1)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%201%20ACSR%20311" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 1 ACSR 311</a> at 312 McLelland J said:
<P>

<i>"In my opinion, documents within the possession of the Commission of a
confidential nature recording information received by the Commission
relating
to possible offences or irregularities, or recording information received in
the course of the investigation of possible
offences or irregularities,
including the identity of informants, and confidential documents recording the
actual or possible course
of such investigations or particulars of available or
potentially available evidence, are in the public interest prima facie immune
from compulsory disclosure, on the basis that such disclosure would be likely
to seriously impede the ability of the Commission to
fulfil its function of
effectively investigating possible offences under, inter alia, the Companies
(NSW) Code, and in appropriate
cases instituting and prosecuting criminal and
civil proceedings in the public interest".</i>
<P>

7  	The prima facie immunity to which McLelland J referred does not
establish the result of the balancing exercising but it does
establish that
such documents enter into it.  McLelland J referred to the following statement
by the majority of the High Court,
in <i>National Companies and Securities
Commission v. News Corporation </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 29</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20156%20CLR%20296" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 156 CLR 296</a> at 323: -
<P>

<i>"It is of the very nature of an investigation that the investigator proceeds
to gather relevant information from as wide a range of
sources as possible
without the suspect looking over his shoulder all the time to see how the
inquiry is going.  For an investigator
to disclose  his hand prematurely will
not only alert the suspect to the progress of the investigation, but may well
close off other
sources of inquiry."</i>
<P>

8  	The claims of the public interest in favour of not requiring law
enforcement agencies to reveal the information they have before
their
investigations are complete are strong and obvious.  They are no less strong
because of several circumstances of the present
case.  
<P>

9  	For a number of sources of information no effectual claim of
immunity could be made as the information is available from other
sources.  The
form of questions put to Mr Robert Porter and recorded in a transcript which is
available show some parts of what must
be taken to be information furnished to
ASIC in some way by Mr Rodney Adler; however the whole of Mr Adler's
information is not shown
in that way.  There is probably a basis for deducing
something about ASIC's methods and lines of inquiry from the records which are
outside the immunity.  The fact that the public interest claim cannot be
effective to protect all of the investigation and can only
protect part of it
has no force as a reason for withholding immunity from that part.  
<P>

10  	Several considerations were put forward in Mr Orchard's evidence
for the balancing exercise.  It was contended that the production
of documents
would be contrary to public interest in relation to due performance by the
Commission of its statutory function to investigate
suspected contraventions of
the Corporations Law and if appropriate to refer such matters to the DPP.  The
statutory function is
conferred by subs.13(1) of the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission Act and relates to investigations where ASIC has
reason
to suspect that contraventions of law have been committed.
<P>

Mr Orchard said that the documents were comprised completely of documents
brought into existence in the course of conducting an
investigation into
suspected contraventions of the Corporations Law. These contentions only
express the initial approach to production
of a law enforcement agency's
documents which brings such documents into the balancing process.
<P>

11  	Mr Orchard said of a number of documents and classes of
information that they were given to the Commission in confidence. 
He offered
no evidence of specific arrangements with any of the informants establishing
the existence and terms of the confidence
or limiting the use to be made of the
information.  His evidence referred to confidence arising from statutory
restrictions and from
the circumstances of information being furnished to a
prosecuting authority.  It is obvious to reasonable people taking part in such
an activity and goes without saying that the information is given so as to be
used only for proper purposes connected with the prosecution.
If an examination
is conducted in accordance with s.19 statutory controls over the use of the
transcript operate.  When informants
give information without being compelled
in that way (which costs ASIC considerably less) they have a legitimate
expectation that
use of the information will be similarly restricted.
<P>

12  	There are obvious limits to the obligation of confidence, as if
there is a prosecution the information will probably have to
be revealed, in a
proper way, in connection with the prosecution; and law enforcement agencies
like everyone else may be subject
to compulsion from Parliaments, courts and
other public authorities.  The circumstances in which confidence is implied has
a part
but I feel not a large part in the balancing exercise.  It could well
have some limiting effect on the availability of information
if persons
furnishing information thought that their information was unquestionably or
readily available for use in civil litigation,
or for any use other than
investigation of law enforcement.
<P>

13  	Mr Orchard expressed this consideration as follows:
<P>

<i>"17.	From time to time during the course of any investigation, the
investigative officers may identify persons from whom admissible
evidence may
be obtained but who they also believe may have committed an offence.  In those
circumstances, the only way that the
investigative officers may obtain that
evidence from the person or persons in a form that they have confidence in
respect of its
admissibility, is to offer that person or those persons a formal
record of interview in which the proper formalities are observed.
 It is my
experience that such persons having been offered a formal record of interview,
often agree to participate in the interview
in the knowledge that the process
and interview are in confidence and that it and the transcript are conducted or
created for the
purpose of the Commission and, or the DPP being better able to
consider and decide whether to charge persons for contraventions of
the
Corporations Law or use that interview material so obtained in any future
criminal proceedings.</i>
<P>

<i> 18.	I believe that should the audio tapes and, or the transcripts of such
interviews be generally available for production to the
Court under subpoena
issued by litigants in civil proceedings, the number of occasions in which
persons who have been offered records
of interview also agree to participate in
that voluntary process would decline significantly.  Such an outcome would
significantly
hinder the ability of the Commission in future cases to obtain
admissible evidence from persons with relevant knowledge in those
future
investigations.  In some cases, that may impact of the quality of the
decision-making in respect of the question of whether
to initiate criminal
proceedings."</i>
<P>

14  	I regard these considerations as relevant, but not of great
weight in view of limits which otherwise exist on the effect of
confidentiality. Where implications of this kind exist, the public interest is
served by respecting the confidence; cf <i>Jacobsen v. Rogers</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 6</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20182%20CLR%20572" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 182
CLR 572</a> at 590.
<P>

15  	The revelation to Mr Robert Porter of parts of what Mr Adler
must be taken to have told ASIC is an illustration of how the
implied
confidence must be understood to be qualified; if the information is given, it
must become known to somebody when it is later
used, and a prosecuting
authority comes under obligations, when interviewing a person against whom
proceedings may be brought, to
give that person the opportunity to deal with
information.
<P>

16  	Mr Orchard also put forward that the consideration that
revealing documents which contained the full text of interviews conducted
with
potential witnesses will disclose all lines of inquiry pursued by the
investigation officer and the information received by
ASIC in confidence up to
the point of each interview.  I regard this as a consideration of some weight,
but limited weight as several
statements have already been made available.
<P>

17  	Mr Orchard's evidence was that revealing the documents would
seriously impede the ability of ASIC to fulfil its function of
effectively
investigating possible offences.  My view is that the ability and effectiveness
of the Commission's investigation would
be impeded to some extent, but not so
far as to make it ineffective.  Mr Orchard also referred to the prospects,
which in view of
the preliminary advice from the DPP appear to me to be quite
strong, that further investigation may have to be undertaken and further
evidence may have to be decided before a final decision is made.  He pointed to
disadvantages if, before the investigation was completed,
 the potential
evidence and relevance comprehensiveness and clarity became known; he contended
that this might compromise the reliability
of any further information.  In my
judgment this is a strong consideration favouring immunity; the investigation
is not yet completed,
and the utility of anything further found and the
opportunity to find it may be impaired if the information already collected,
with
whatever limitations it has, is made available to those potentially
affected.
<P>

18  	Overall, the circumstance that the investigation is incomplete
and has not reached the point where a decision has been taken
as to whether
there is to be a prosecution or not is a powerful consideration favouring
immunity.  An investigation in which all
information to hand from time to time
is open to knowledge of the persons potentially affected, and the parties to
this litigation
include several of those persons, is very unlikely to be
effective.
<P>

19  	The consideration set against this is another public interest in
the attainment of justice which supports the plaintiff and
other parties to the
litigation having available to them any statements made by parties and
potential witnesses about the relevant
facts.  All such statements can make a
contribution to establishing what a witness can be expected to say, and also
the reliability
of evidence; they enable processes of comparison and testing of
narrations given by witnesses at different times to be undertaken.
 For
information given by the defendant, and by all witnesses who are prepared to
consent, the plaintiff already has that material.
 For the remaining seven
persons it may be inferred that as they have not given their consent the
plaintiff may have difficulty getting
information from them, and for two of
them, Mr Adler and Mr Loiterton there is evidence that they have declined to
give information.
 Mr Frawley, a solicitor conducting the litigation for the
plaintiffs, has given evidence that he perceives that Richard Walker and
Ian
Porter (who is the defendant's brother) would be unwilling to assist the
plaintiffs.
<P>

20  	The plaintiff's counsel pointed to the decision of Lehane J in
<i>Hadid v. Lenfest Communications Inc.</i> FCA 7 May 1998, and contended that
in view of that decision there could not reasonably be much reliance on such
circumstances of
confidence.  That decision was an application of the balancing
test to the facts of that case, of which Lehane J. said "The cumulative
circumstances of this case are somewhat unusual" (p5).  Those circumstances
included that the investigation had long been concluded
and that the applicant
already had part of the witness's information, and I would respectfully say
that the following conclusion
was on the facts unremarkable: "In all those
circumstances, in my view, disclosure of the Heller documents to the parties to
this
proceeding is likely to have only a slight deterrent effect, if any, on
those who in future might contemplate voluntarily giving
information to the
ASC; ...".  This cannot be applied generally to cases where the investigation
still proceeds.
<P>

21  	The plaintiffs' wishes relate to finding out what evidence may
be available, and to matters ancillary to the adduction of evidence
relating to
credit and credibility.  Evidence already filed shows, or makes it likely that
Messrs Adler, Loiterton, Peter Hall and
Ian Hall spoke to the defendant Mr
Robert Porter before or at the time of the relevant discussions; hence it can
be inferred that
they may be able to give relevant information.  Mr Glasgow is
a witness whose affidavit the plaintiff has obtained and filed.  Mr
Walker is a
witness whose affidavit the defendant has obtained and filed.  The other five
are persons whose evidence neither party
has obtained and filed, although the
parties have been under directions which would have required them to do so.
Plaintiff's counsel
observed that the plaintiffs may wish to call evidence from
these persons depending on its contents.  The plaintiff either has not
been
able to get or has not got evidence from them.  The plaintiffs' counsel
contended "depending on what they may have told ASIC
in examinations on oath,
the plaintiffs may wish to subpoena them to give evidence in these proceedings.
At the moment that is not
a practicable course ..".  Counsel also referred to
the possibility that information given at an early stage when recollection was
fresh may be better than information available later, and may be available as a
test of recollection.
<P>

22  	The endeavour to find what these five persons told ASIC is at
one remove from the matter brought into the balancing exercise,
that is the
public interest in the administration of justice, which is served by having
relevant evidence before the court; it is
at a remove because the plaintiff
wishes to find whether they can give relevant evidence, and what it is, without
their co-operation.
 The exercise is to find out whether there is any relevant
evidence, not necessarily to get it before the court.  Plaintiffs' counsel
contended that simply to call a witness on subpoena without knowing in advance
what the witness is likely to say and find that out
from his evidence what it
is is not a practical course. I accept that in all prudence a witness cannot be
called on that basis where,
as here, the litigant has other material.  The
considerations which make it imprudent to call a witness who does not
co-operate may
be reduced if the witness' statement is available, depending on
what it contains, but remain formidable.  For Mr Glasgow and Mr Walker
the
exercise is to find what additional sources of material, which may be useful
either to assist memory or to attack credibility,
may be available in a context
where what the witness has to say in evidence in chief is already known.  
<P>

23  	Counsel also contended that it was appropriate for the court to
consider restricting access to and use of the material, for
example to
restricting access to lawyers representing the parties.  I do not regard an
attempt to restrict access as practicable;
if the information is of any use, it
must be given in the proceedings and given publicly, and there is no
substantial basis for attempting
to conduct the hearing in private.  I regard
an attempt to give limited protection to the immunity as impracticable.
<P>

24  	What these five persons may have to say could well be important,
but the evidence does not establish that it will be important
or establish
except in the most general way what it may deal with.  It has not been shown
that it is necessary for the attainment
of justice that what they have to say
should be known; the object of seeking to compel inspection is to find out what
they have to
say, whether it is significant and how it is significant.  The
matters relating to the evidence of Mr Glasgow and Mr Walker must
present
themselves in every case where civil litigation and a law enforcement
investigation deal with the same facts.  
<P>

25  	Consideration of what the public interest in the administration
of justice requires should not be broken down into an easy
assumption that all
information collected by law enforcement authorities is to be available for
litigants; law enforcement authorities
do not labour for the advantage of
private litigants, but for public purposes of high importance.  The plaintiff
does not bring into
the balance any demonstration that anything will be added
to the evidence to be put before the court in these proceedings; the exercise
is investigative.
<P>

26  	My view of the balancing exercise is that there is a decided
preponderance in favour of according immunity.  
<P>

27  	The defendant Mr Porter brought the second to sixth cross-claims
against five persons who are alleged to have been present
at a joint meeting of
the Investment Committee and the Board of Directors of OAMPS Ltd on 30 June
1998 when decisions were made which
are at the heart of the plaintiff's claim
against Mr Porter.  These cross-defendants Mr Siggins, Mr Harris, Mr Glasgow,
Mr Sharkey
and Mr Windebank each applied for orders that these cross-claims be
struck out under Pt.15 r.26.  There are four notices of motion
on the file and
I was told that Mr Sharkey so applied, although he has not filed a notice of
motion.  The defendant conceded these
applications and applied by Notice of
Motion of 11 November 1999 for leave to amend each of the cross-claims.  This
application was
opposed.  
<P>

28  	As the trial of the proceedings is almost three months off and
the cross-defendants are already involved there is adequate
time for them to
prepare for the hearing.  Part 20 r.1(2) of the Rules of Court in imperative
terms, provides: "All necessary amendments
shall be made for the purpose of
determining the real matters raised by or otherwise depending on the
proceedings, or of correcting
any defect or error in any proceedings, or of
avoiding multiplicity of proceedings."  This greatly limits the discretionary
element,
but it is relevant to consider whether the amendment will produce a
procedurally fair result in terms of clarity and particularity,
and whether the
claims raised are fairly arguable or obviously futile.  A liberal approach is
required: <i>Queensland v. J.L. Holdings Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20189%20CLR%20146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 189 CLR 146.</a>  
<P>

29  	During the course of argument the plaintiff's counsel pointed
out minor redrafting which he proposed and produced particulars
of paras 4, 5,
6 and 8; these should be incorporated.
<P>

30  	The substance of the case proposed to be raised, as revealed by
the pleading and also by the course of argument, is that each
of these
cross-defendants as a member of the Investment Committee voted in favour of a
resolution proposed by the defendant that
the second plaintiff invest a large
sum in Clifford Corporation thereby committing the second plaintiff to making
that investment;
and did so with the improper purpose of securing the position
of the defendant Mr Robert Porter as managing director of the first
plaintiff.
The purpose alleged is a condition of mind and a party pleading that condition
of mind is to give particulars of facts
relied on.  See Pt.16 r.3.  A
deficiency in the pleading proffered is that it does not explicitly say, and
should have said if it
was fairly to express the cross-claim, that the
existence of the wrongful purpose is alleged to be shown by the events set out
in
para.1(f); that Mr Robert Porter made a statement at the joint meeting of
the Investment Committee attended by each cross-defendant,
and that they then
each voted in favour of the resolution.  Unless this is stated with clarity and
in the form of particulars the
possibility exists that these cross-defendants
may be exposed to attempts to prove the alleged purpose in some other way.
This may
be overcome by redrafting the document to some extent so as to bring
appropriate precision to bear on the allegation.
<P>

31  	The facts on which this finding is, according to the pleading,
to be based are not facts which on the whole view of his case
the defendant
advocates.  He denies that he had or expressed the improper purpose of making
the investment to secure his own position,
and the claims against these
cross-defendants are in effect claims for contribution to a liability which he
disputes he should bear.
 That is, of course, an appropriate case to present in
a cross-claim.  These circumstances are alluded to in the opening lines of
para.1 of the proposed amendment:  "In these proceedings the plaintiffs have
alleged <u>and have sought to prove by affidavits filed in the proceedings</u>
..." which introduces a number of subparagraphs including 1(f).  It is
appropriate to recite those circumstances in which the cross-claim
was made but
it is not appropriate that reference to any of those affidavits should be
required to understand any of the allegations
in the cross-claim.  The pleading
should speak for itself, and even cross-references incorporating passages in
earlier pleadings
are inappropriate ways of making allegations.  
<P>

32  	The proposed amended cross-claim should be redrafted to
incorporate all the particulars to which I have referred.
<P>

33  	Another respect in which the draft is inadequate is that in not
an altogether explicit way it is alleged against each cross-defendant
that he
was present at the meeting at all material times; whereas reference to the
affidavits shows that Mr Windebank was not present
at some time, although there
is no undisputed position about when he was present and how he participated.
Reference to the affidavits
initially appeared incidental but it precipitated a
survey of what the affidavits had to say, and this is an inappropriate means
of
ascertaining what is alleged in the pleading.
<P>

34  	On behalf of Mr Windebank, the sixth cross-defendant it was
contended that paras 4 and 5 in the draft are internally inconsistent.
 To my
reading, when allowances are made for the circumstances in which allegations
adverse to Mr Porter are made and are not adopted
by him for all purposes,
there is no internal inconsistency.
<P>

35  	It was also contended by Mr Windebank's counsel that para.8(b)
in referring to "fiduciary duties" is unsatisfactory because
fiduciary duties
breached are not earlier alleged, nor are they satisfactorily identified.  This
submission is correct; any fiduciary
duty alleged and the based on the facts in
which the duty is said to exist should be clearly shown by the pleading, and
breaches
should be alleged with sufficient particularity to relate the matter
complained of to the fiduciary duty.
<P>

36  	Mr Windebank's counsel also made an observation on the reference
in para.4 of the draft to subpara.1(d); the text shows that
this reference is
incorrect and the plaintiff's counsel told me that he wished to substitute a
reference to subpara.1(f)(1).
<P>

37  	Mr Windebank's counsel also argued to the effect that it is
futile to maintain or that it is not reasonably arguable, having
regard to the
references to Mr Windebank in the affidavit, that Mr Windebank was present at
the meeting at a time when Mr Porter
made the statement alleged.  As a formal
matter it appears to me to be correct that no affidavit or combination of
affidavits establishes
that Mr Porter made the statement alleged and that Mr
Windebank was present at the meeting at the same time; this exemplifies the
difficulty for the cross-claim  that Mr Porter maintains that there was no such
statement and his affidavit is to that effect, yet
the cross-claims are based
on a view of the facts which his own evidence does not support.  The procedure
of allowing cross-claims
to be heard at the same time as principal claims
exists, in large part, to enable merits to be determined notwithstanding that
anomalies
of this kind appear to stand in the way of commencing claims; the
whole of the facts are to be sorted out at the trial of the proceedings.
 These
submissions demonstrated difficulties confronting Mr Porter; they did not
demonstrate that the cross-claim was futile.
<P>

38  	Mr Windebank's counsel made observations on a lack of
particularity in paras. 4, 5 and 6 which in my view are overcome by particulars
which the plaintiff's counsel proposes to incorporate.
<P>

39  	Mr Windebank's counsel made observations on the multifariousness
of para.6 of the draft, and offered an analysis which shows
arithmetically that
when the allegations of being concerned in, a party to aiding, abetting (and so
forth) the transaction are applied
to all the matters referred to in para.1(g),
draft para. 6 rolls up 42 different allegations, but does not state any of them
with
particularity.  Draft para.6 is introduced by the words "by reasons of the
matters referred to in paras.4 and 5" and these words
confine, to some degree
the multifariousness of para. 6, but do so only by introducing great difficulty
in reading three paragraphs
together and discerning what is referred to.  In my
view there is a need to redraft para.6 and greatly confine its reference so
that
it could be understood directly and does not introduce or roll up a large
number of mathematical possibilities which are not truly
relied on.  
<P>

40  	As the breach truly relied on is voting in support of the
resolution, para.6 should be drafted so as directly to show that
that is the
breach, and to remove possibilities that it may be used as a vehicle for
presenting some other matter which is not clearly
indicated by its terms.
Paragraph 7 is related to para.6 and suffers in a similar way.  It suffers from
excessive reliance on cross-references
and from the absence of any clear
specification that the breach complained of is voting at the meeting and doing
so with the improper
purpose.  The reference to s.79 of the Corporations Law is
very unclear as that section specifies many ways in which a person may
be
involved in a contravention.  The references to subsections 232(2),(4) and (6)
are also unclear.  Once again arithmetic could
suggest a very large number of
combinations to which para.7 could refer; the allegation must be reduced to
intelligibility and what
in substance is relied on must be shown with
particularity.
<P>

41  	Counsel for the second, third, fourth and fifth cross-defendants
traced the elaborate chain of provisions in the Corporations
Law which may
impose liability for involvement in a contravention of s.232 by another person.
This demonstrates the importance of
showing in a clear way in the pleading
whether the claim is based on a liability imposed under the Law on a particular
cross-defendant
in respect of that cross-defendant's own  conduct or its based
on involvement in breaches by Mr Porter.  Precision of definition
has
implications for the approach to be taken in Mr Porter's claims for
contribution.  
<P>

42  	Counsel for these cross-defendants contended that the
circumstances in which one director can claim contribution from another
were
limited in some way which does not extend to the present facts.  In my opinion
the authority to which he referred, <i>Walsh v. Bardsley &amp; Anor</i> (1931)
57 Times Law Reports 564, does not bear this out; that decision, in which there
is no exposition of underlying principles,
appears to me to have been based on
Romer LJ's view of the appropriate equitable adjustment upon the facts of that
case.  If Mr Porter
and the cross-defendant incurred a co-ordinate liability
for breaches of fiduciary duty arising out of the same events it is reasonably
open to contention that one or the other may be entitled to contribution or
indemnity.  
<P>

43  	Counsel also contended that the apportionment legislation of
Victoria and New South Wales referred to in para.9 of the draft
cannot support
the claim.  For the New South Wales legislation which refers only to a
tortfeasor this contention could well be right,
although counsel did not refer
to any authority establishing conclusively that this is so.  The Victorian
contribution legislation
does not speak in terms of tort and tortfeasors.  It
is introduced by subs.23B(1) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/wa1958111/" class="autolink_findacts">Wrongs Act 1958</a> (Victoria) thus "... A
person liable in respect of any damage suffered by another person may recover
contribution from any other
person liable in respect to the same damage ..."
It is reasonably arguable that this extends to causes of action created by
statute,
to causes of action founded on breach of statutory duty and to
equitable claims as well as to claims based on tort.
<P>

44  	Counsel contended to the effect that it has been established by
observations of Clarke JA in <i>Thompson v Hill</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2038%20NSWLR%20714" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 38 NSWLR 714</a> at
734-735 that a claim for contribution based on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/wa1958111/s23b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.23B</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/wa1958111/" class="autolink_findacts">Wrongs Act 1958</a>
(Victorian) is not justiciable in New South Wales.  His Honour's observations
relate to the content and application of private international
law with respect
to proceedings in New South Wales for damages for a tort committed outside New
South Wales.  The observations were
not addressed to claims based on the
statutory rights to contribution or other statutory rights, and were not
addressed to jurisdiction
under the cross-vesting legislation.  In that case
the plaintiff did not invoke the cross-vesting legislation or ask this court to
exercise the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Victoria; to do so would have
been entirely fatal to the plaintiff's claim, the
object of which was to escape
from Victorian statutory provisions.  In my respectful view Clarke JA's
observations did not deal with
the justiciability of a claim based on the
Victorian contribution legislation, and it is reasonably open to argument that
in the
claim which the cross-claimant now makes the rules of private
international law have no part.  
<P>

45  	In my view, although the amendment should not be allowed in
exactly the form in which it is put forward, an amendment should
be allowed if
redrafted in the manner which I have indicated, provided that the redraft is
put before me very promptly.
<P>

46  	The application may be restored to the list on one day's
notice.
<P>

47  	The Orders are:
<P>

(1)	I make orders as in claims 2 and 3 of Australian Securities and Investments
Commission's Notice of Motion filed on 5 October
1999;
<P>

	(2)	I order that the plaintiff pay the Australian Securities and Investments
Commission's costs of the Notice of Motion.
