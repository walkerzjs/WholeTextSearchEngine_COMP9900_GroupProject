<P>

<b>2539/98 - GLOBAL CUSTODIANS LIMITED V MESH &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>   By summons filed 22 May 1998 and amended on 17 June
1998, the plaintiff sought a declaration that it was entitled to inspect all
books of account of the Estate Mortgage Fighting Fund Trust established by deed
made 2 August 1990 between Hari Bhagat as settlor
and Pamela Ann Mesh and Helen
Chuproff as trustees.  Various ancillary orders were sought.
<P>

2	After voluminous affidavits were filed on both sides, the matter found its
way into what might loosely be called "the Estate Mortgage
Case Management
List" of which I am in charge.  On hearing the matters in that list on 9
December 1998 I ordered that the questions
in Schedule A to the plaintiff's
notice of motion be decided separately and before all the other issues in the
proceedings.  I then
listed for 18 and 19 May 1999 the hearing of these
separate issues.
<P>

3	On 18 May Mr R F Margo appeared for the plaintiff, Dr L Robinson with Mrs B
Macrae appeared for the first and second defendants,
and the third defendant,
Mr Bhagat, appeared in person.  Mr Margo said that he now only sought the
determination of three questions.
 However, the defendants objected to this and
in the end, rather than lose the hearing date, Mr Margo agreed that the
original questions
would be before the court, but he indicated that he would
only be seeking to argue questions which were the equivalent of 3 to 8.
 
<P>

4	The defendants made it quite clear that the reason why they objected to
questions 1 and 2 being deleted was that the only assignment
on which the
plaintiff could possibly rely before the proceedings were commenced on 22 May
1998 was the assignment to the Speights
referred to in question 1.  Unless the
plaintiff could establish the Speight assignment, then there was no locus
standi for it to
bring any proceedings on 22 May and accordingly the whole suit
should be dismissed.
<P>

5	Mr Margo submitted that the summons had been amended on 17 June 1998.  By
that date there had also been an assignment by the Greenlees
so that even if
the Speight assignment was bad, the Greenlees assignment would support the
proceedings.  The defendants said that
this was too late.
<P>

6	There is no doubt that the defendants' argument would have been correct
before the introduction of Part 20 r 1(3A) of the Supreme
Court Rules.  
<P>

7	I believe the appropriate way of dealing with this problem is to insert a
further question 2A, which I have inserted of my own
motion, into the questions
posed last December because it is necessary to answer this question along with
the others.  With this
amendment the questions I have to consider are as
follows:
<P>

1.	Whether Mr John Healey Speight (also known as Jack Speight) and Mrs Jessie
Barrie Marr Speight ("the Speights") were beneficiaries
of the Estate Mortgage
Fighting Fund Trust ("the Trust")?
<P>

2.	If the answer to question 1 is in the affirmative, whether the deed of
assignment dated 17 February 1998 between the Speights
as assignors and the
plaintiff as assignee was valid to assign the Speights' rights as beneficiaries
of the Trust to the plaintiff?
 (I have called this the "Speight
Assignment")
<P>

2A.	If the answer to question 1 or 2 is in the negative, whether it was
competent for the plaintiff to amend the summons on 17 June
1998 and continue
this litigation?
<P>

3.	Whether the amending deed dated 6 April 1998 between the third defendant as
settlor of the Trust and the first and second defendants
as trustees of the
Trust purporting to amend the trust deed of the Trust by amending the
definition of "Beneficiaries" in the trust
deed retrospectively to the effect
that beneficiaries in the Trust will not be entitled to assign their rights as
beneficiaries ("the
Amending Deed"):
<P>

(a)	was made in breach of fiduciary obligations owed to the beneficiaries,
further or alternatively to the plaintiff beneficiary,
by the settlor and the
trustees respectively?
<P>

(b)	is ineffective?
<P>

(c)	should be set aside?
<P>

4.	If the answers to questions 1, 2 and 3(b) or 3(c) are in the affirmative,
whether or not the plaintiff until further order and
by its external legal
advisers and independent professional accountants, who have given
confidentiality undertakings to the court,
should be permitted to inspect the
books of account of the Trust and lists of its beneficiaries ("the interim
relief")?
<P>

5.	If the answers to questions 1 and 2 are in the affirmative, and the answer
to question 3(b) and 3(c) are in the negative, whether
or not the amending deed
operated retrospectively to invalidate the assignment by the Speights to the
plaintiff?
<P>

6.	If the answer to question 5 is in the negative, whether or not the plaintiff
should be given the interim relief?
<P>

7.	Whether the deed of assignment dated 30 May 1998 between Mr Archie Greenlees
and Mrs Norma Patricia Greenlees ("the Greenlees")
as assignors and the
plaintiff as assignee was valid to assign the Greenlees' rights as
beneficiaries of the Trust to the plaintiff?
<P>

8.	If the answer to question 7 is in the affirmative, whether or not the
plaintiff should be given the interim relief?
<P>

I will deal with these questions in turn.
<P>

8	1 &amp; 2.		The first matter of fact that arises before I can answer these
questions is whether the Speights were ever members
of the Trust.  
<P>

9	The background facts are more or less undisputed.  In June 1990 concern was
felt amongst a lot of investors in a series of property
trusts which can
conveniently be described as "the Estate Mortgage Trusts".  There were many
small investors in these trusts including
many pensioners.  A Mr Van Breugel in
Melbourne and Mr Hari Bhagat in Sydney, concerned themselves in organising unit
holders into
groups for the purpose of bringing recovery actions.
<P>

10	At a meeting in Melbourne on 8 July 1990, a national committee was elected
to represent unit holders and the Estate Mortgage
Fighting Fund was formed.
Messrs Galbally and O'Bryan were appointed solicitors to that Fund.
<P>

11	On 16 July 1990, Mr Bhagat placed advertisements in newspapers, for a
meeting to be held at the Hordern Pavilion in respect of
the Estate Mortgage
Fighting Fund.  The advertisement bore the names Hari &amp; Pamela Bhagat.
Pamela Bhagat is the wife of Hari
Bhagat and is identical with the first
defendant, Pamela Anne Mesh.  Mr Van Breugel, who by that stage called himself
the chairman
of the national committee, gave that meeting his goodwill, but
indicated that any money collected should be sent to Melbourne, that
the NSW
committee would be considered a sub-committee of the national committee, and
that careful arrangements should be made to
record the names of subscribers so
that they could receive the news releases.
<P>

12	At the Hordern Pavilion on 22 July, Mr Bhagat made a speech, the text of
which is in evidence.  A hundred dollars was collected
from each of a series of
people and was banked by Brambles Security with the Westpac Bank, initially in
Brambles own bank account.
<P>

13	However, even by the next day, a dispute arose between the national
committee and the NSW group as to various matters.  It was
initially proposed
that the NSW moneys would be covered by a trust deed in which there would be
six trustees including a Mr Clout.
This deed was executed on 25 July 1990.  On
the same day a bank account was opened at the Westpac Bank Royal Exchange
Branch and
Brambles transferred the moneys collected at the Hordern Pavilion
into that account.
<P>

14	The settlor named in the trust deed was Hari Bhagat.  Clauses 2.1 to 2.3 of
the trust deed were as follows:
<P>

"2.1	The Settlor declares and directs that the Trustees shall act and the
Trustees agree to act as Trustees of the Trust Fund and
will hold the Trust
Fund upon the trusts subject to the provisions of this deed.
<P>

2.2.	The Trustees may in their absolute discretion at any time or times during
the continuance of the Trust accept or reject any
moneys, investments and
property which may be donated or otherwise given or offered to the Trust by any
person.
<P>

2.3	The Trustees shall stand possessed of the Trust Fund in trust for the
Beneficiaries in proportion to their respective contributions
to the Trust
Fund."
<P>

15	"Beneficiaries" was defined in clause 1.2 as "Those parties who have, at any
time, been represented by the Settlor and Pamela
Mesh/Bhagat in the Proceedings
and any other person who has contributed moneys, investments or property to the
Trust which has been
accepted by the Trustees."
<P>

16	Paragraph 9.1 of the trust deed is as follows:
<P>

"At the direction of the Settlor, the Trustees must by deed alter, modify, add
to or cancel all or any of the provisions of this
deed (including this clause)
in such manner and to such extent that the Settlor thinks fit on the condition
that the Settlor is and
the Trustees are satisfied that such alteration,
modification, addition or cancellation does not, unless all the Beneficiaries
agree,
prejudice the interests of the Beneficiaries at the time of such
alteration, modification, addition or cancellation."
<P>

17	Clause 10.1 permitted the settlor by instrument to remove any trustee in his
absolute discretion and without giving any reason
for the removal.
<P>

18	On 27 July 1990, Mr Bhagat indicated to Mr Van Breugel, that as far as he
was concerned, the Estate Mortgage Fighting Fund Trust
NSW was not a party to
the national committee.  He stipulated his terms for co-operation with the
national committee.  On 29 July,
there was a purported removal of Mr and Mrs
Bhagat from their office in the NSW Estate Mortgage Fighting Fund with them
being replaced
by Messrs Priddy and Joyce.
<P>

19	On 30 and 31 July, the six trustees directed Westpac to freeze the account
until further notice.
<P>

20	On 31 July Mr Bhagat as settlor, purported to remove all the trustees and to
appoint instead his wife and a Mrs Chuproff, who
are the present first and
second defendants.
<P>

21	A new trust deed was then executed on 2 August 1990 with Mr Bhagat as
settlor and Ms Mesh and Mrs Chuproff as trustees.  Apart
from the change of
trustees, the only difference was the omission of clause 10.4 which had
required the trustees to give notice of
the fact of removal of a trustee to all
beneficiaries.
<P>

22	On 5 August 1990, Mr Bhagat as settlor, purported to amend the 25 July 1990
deed to delete clause 10.4.
<P>

23	The Speights, it would appear, attended the Hordern Pavilion meeting and a
cheque butt has been produced dated 22/7/1990 with
the notation "Estate Mort
Fighting Fund $100".  Although Exhibit DX218 gives a list of the people who had
contributed at the Hordern
Pavilion and elsewhere, there is no mention of this
$100 having been banked.
<P>

24	On 7 August, J &amp; B Speight wrote to the Westpac Bank alleging that they
had subscribed $100 by cheque, that they understood
the money had been
deposited with Westpac and under no account did they want their money removed
by Mr Bhagat.  
<P>

25	In November 1990, a settlement was reached between the Melbourne group and
Mr Bhagat.  The settlement was that if a donor requested
his or her money to be
returned that would happen, where there was a request that a fund go to either
the Sydney or Melbourne fund
that would be implemented;  otherwise the funds
would be divided one-third to Melbourne and two-thirds to Sydney.
<P>

26	Although the evidence is fairly slim, it would seem that Mr Clout's copy of
the Westpac list confirmed a payment by the Speights
and that Mr Clout's
recollection is that that payment eventually found its way to Melbourne.
Neither Mr Clout nor Mr or Mrs Speight
gave evidence.
<P>

27	In March 1992, the Speights wrote to Mrs Chuproff requesting a meeting of
beneficiaries to consider and determine the Trust pursuant
to clause 8.3 of the
trust deed and asking for a full audited account to be sent to the
beneficiaries prior to the meeting.   There
is no evidence as to what happened
following this letter.
<P>

28	My duty is to find the facts on the material that I have.  On that material
I must find that the Speights paid their $100 at
the Hordern Pavilion, it was
collected by Brambles and banked to the Westpac account in the name of the six
trustees and then transferred
to Melbourne.  The question is on these facts
were they  beneficiaries?
<P>

29	The reason why this question is important is that on 17 February 1998 the
Speights executed a deed of assignment of their interest
in the Trust to the
plaintiff.   The plaintiff claims that that assignment gives it locus to
commence these proceedings (alternatively
if this assignment does not, then the
Greenlees assignment, to which I will pass in due course has that effect).
<P>

30	I should note here that although it is not relevant for this set of reasons,
it would seem that the Melbourne group settled with
the persons involved with
the Estate Mortgage Funds whereas the Sydney group is still very much in battle
with them.  The plaintiff,
which is closely connected with the current trustees
of the Estate Mortgage Funds is very much interested in the activities of the
NSW group.   Mr Bhagat has been its very vocal opponent in various pieces of
litigation now before the court.
<P>

31	I have already set out the definition of beneficiaries.  On the facts as I
have found them, there is a literal compliance with
the definition in that the
Speights' money was contributed at the Hordern Pavilion and  it was banked in
the name of the six trustees
with Westpac Bank.  Only later did it go to
Melbourne either as a result of the Speights' letter of August 1990 or because
of some
formal or informal distribution of contributions.  There does not
appear to be any qualification on the definition as to a person
who has been a
beneficiary but who has ceased to have any involvement with the Trust.  That
this is so is reinforced by the words
"at any time" in the definition.
<P>

32	However as has been seen, under clause 2.3 the Trust Fund is held in trust
for the beneficiaries in proportion to their respective
contributions to the
Trust Fund.  This would seem inequitable if, pursuant to the settlement with
the people in Melbourne, people
who had their money in the Westpac Bank account
returned to them were still able to claim as beneficiaries.
<P>

33	However, on the other hand, it is to be noted that the rights of
beneficiaries are incidentally noted throughout the deed.  The
most important
reference is clause 8.3 that the Trust may be determined by a two-third
majority vote of the beneficiaries which suggests
that there is a definable
number of beneficiaries and that a list is kept of them.  There are other
provisions dealing with the consent
of all the beneficiaries.
<P>

34	This causes one to analyse what are the rights of the beneficiaries.  
<P>

35	There was much debate before me as to whether the present trust is a fixed
trust or a discretionary trust.  
<P>

36	The defendants submit that the distinction between the two types of trust is
that with a discretionary trust the trustee has
a discretion as to when any
payment from the trust fund will be made and as to who in a definite class of
beneficiaries will receive
it, whilst in a fixed trust the trustee has no such
discretion.  They cite <b>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Vegners </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2090%20ALR%20547" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989)
90 ALR 547.</a>  However, at p 552 in that report Gummow J, when a Federal Court
Judge, said that the meaning of the term "discretionary trust" is
"Primarily a
matter of usage, not doctrine."
<P>

37	The argument then proceeded that as none of the beneficiaries had an
interest in the capital or income of the Trust until the
time of distribution
their entitlement was merely to due administration of the Trust and so they did
not have an interest in the
benefit under the Trust and thus had no standing.
<b>Collins v AMP Superannuation Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20147%20ALR%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 147 ALR 243</a>, 251, was cited in
this connection, but that was a case as to standing before the Commonwealth
Superannuation Tribunal.  
<P>

38	There is no element of discretion in the instant Trust.  Clause 2.3 is quite
clear.  The Trust Fund is held for the beneficiaries
in proportion to their
contributions.  However, in the meantime it is to be utilised for the common
purpose of recovering moneys
from what Mr Bhagat calls "the Estate Mortgage
debacle".
<P>

39	However, this does not necessarily mean that a beneficiary's interest is
assignable.  All that happens to a person who purports
to assign his or her
interest is that he or she ceases to be a beneficiary.
<P>

40	For practical purposes, as the Speights are not plaintiffs, what must be
shown is the assignment of a legal chose in action within
the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 12</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a>.  The reason for this is that it would only be
such an assignment which would have the effect of enabling the plaintiff to sue
in
its own name or at least enabling the plaintiff to sue in its own name
without naming the Speights as defendants.
<P>

41	A legal chose in action within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 12</a> comprehends all assignable legal rights:
<b>King v Victoria Insurance Co Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1896%5d%20AC%20250" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1896] AC 250</a>, 254.  "An essential
criterion of a chose in action is that the right concerned is one of a
proprietary character;  a purely personal
right, however valuable it may be
from the standpoint of the person entitled thereto, cannot be of the nature of
a chose in action
...".
<P>

42	In the instant case it is only when the Trust has been terminated, the
beneficiaries and their respective shares known, that
there could be a
situation where a legal chose in action existed.  Up until that time there is
either an equitable chose in action
or an equitable right short of a chose in
action.  In either case <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 12</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a> would not be
applicable.
<P>

43	It follows that the present suit cannot be properly constituted without the
assignors being parties.
<P>

44	I pause here to note that there appears to be a gap in the State's
protection of funds raised at a public meeting.  Probably,
though not
certainly, as funds were raised from Estate Mortgage investors there was no
fund raising from "the public" under the Corporations
Law.  As the funds were
not raised for any charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or patriotic purpose,
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfa1991201/" class="autolink_findacts">Charitable Fundraising Act 1991</a> is inapplicable.  Thus it would not appear
that any public official could intervene to ensure that the fund is, as
promised, controlled
by trustees, rather than being used at the settlor's sole
discretion.  However, there is some control as a beneficiary may obtain
relief
if he or she can show a breach of trust or otherwise good cause for the court
to involve itself in the administration of the
trust.  Experience with other
public funds tends to show that this is insufficient as only very few
beneficiaries will spend their
own moneys to take this step.  I thus draw the
matter to the attention of Law Reform bodies.  
<P>

45	It is tempting to stop at this point, but as the Speights are obviously in
the plaintiff's camp, and were persons who probably
held the beneficiary's
right for an account at the date of institution of the proceedings, it would be
doubtless an easy matter for
them to be added as plaintiffs or defendants.
Accordingly, I will need to consider the problem a little more deeply, that is,
is
the right of a beneficiary at this stage something which can be assigned?
<P>

46	I believe that it is useful to start with the case of a discretionary trust
even though the present is not a discretionary trust.
 Although there is very
little learning on the point, the better view is that one cannot assign one's
interest as a possible object
of a discretionary trust in such a way as to give
the assignee the benefit accruing to the object of the trust in the form of
appointed
property;  see Grbich and others <b>Winding Up Trusts </b>(CCH,
Sydney, 1984) p 56. At the most, what would be able to be assigned would be the
right to have the Fund properly administered.
 That is the right to apply to a
court of equity to have the Fund properly administered.
<P>

47	It is clear that a bare right of action cannot be either a chose in action
or assignable under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cfa1991201/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 12</a> or otherwise;  see eg <b>Glegg v Bromley </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1912%5d%203%20KB%20474" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1912] 3

</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%201%20QB%20101" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965] 1 QB 101</a>, 120.  The test is, in the words of Parker J in <b>Glegg's
case </b>at p 490, "Whether the subject-matter of the assignment was, in the
view of the Court, property with an incidental remedy for its
recovery, or was
a bare right to bring an action either at law or in equity."
<P>

48	Thus with a discretionary trust the assignee would only get the right to
bring proceedings for due administration and accordingly
there could be no
assignment of the interest.
<P>

49	The present Trust is not a discretionary trust but clause 7.3 of the trust
deed reads as follows:
<P>

"7.2	A Beneficiary is not entitled to require the transfer to him of any of the
property comprised in the Trust Fund nor (subject
to the Beneficiaries's rights
created by this deed and by law) is he entitled to interfere with or question
the exercise or non-exercise
by the Trustees of any of the trusts, powers,
authorities or discretions conferred upon them by this deed or in respect of
such property."
<P>

50	 As Ford and Lee show in their <b>Principles of the Law of Trusts </b>(LBC,
Sydney, 1996) at para [9290] as substituted in 1999, it is misconceived to
think of the right of the beneficiary to inspect
documents in terms of a
proprietary right of the beneficiary.  Although that thought has passed through
the minds of various  Judges
who have given recent decisions in this area, as
those learned authors say, that theory gives rise to more problems than it
solves.
 All the beneficiary really has is rights against the trustee;  <b>Re
Simersall </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/221.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCA 221</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20108%20ALR%20375" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 108 ALR 375</a>, 381.  See also <b>Morris v Morris </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%209%20WAR%20150" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993)
9 WAR 150</a>, 153.
<P>

51	It should also be observed that this procedural equity to inspect documents
is in any event subject to the proviso that such
right is only exercisable when
it would not be inconsistent with the purpose of the Trust;  see Ford and Lee
op cit para [9290].
<P>

52	Thus the "right" to call for accounts or to inspect documents is a mere
procedural right which has not passed to the assignee.
<P>

53	It follows that at least unless the trustee has committed an actual breach
of trust or the Trust is at home, all that the beneficiary
has is a right of
action in equity.  This is not the subject of an assignment.
<P>

54	There seems to be no provision made in the deed for assigning the right to
receive a pro rata payment at the termination of the
Trust.  However, prima
facie all species of property legal or equitable present or future can be
assigned at least in equity.  However,
an assignment of a right to receive
proceeds at the end of the Trust does not transfer the right to interfere with
the Trust itself.
 An analogy is an assignment of a share in a partnership.
Unless the partnership agreement makes special provision, an assignment
of a
partner's interest merely assigns the share of capital or income otherwise
payable to the assignor.   Although the assignment
of the interest of a partner
is now dealt with by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pa1892154/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 31</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pa1892154/" class="autolink_findacts">Partnership Act 1892</a>, that section is merely
declaratory of the rules of law and equity before the Act was commenced.  
<P>

55	The assignment of an interest in the partnership operates to assign the
income and capital of the partnership in such a way as
to make the partner a
trustee of the assignee, but it in no way entitles the assignee to interfere
with partnership affairs:  <b>Commissioner of Taxation v Everett </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1980/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] HCA 6</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20143%20CLR%20440" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 143
CLR 440.</a>  Furthermore in partnership it is clear that the assignee is bound to
accept the account of profits as agreed by the original partners
and the
partnership books of account are conclusive in the absence of contrary
agreement:  <b>Yuill v Kidman </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1910/63.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1910] HCA 63</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281910%29%2011%20CLR%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1910) 11 CLR 601</a> and see Higgins and
Fletcher, <b>Law of Partnership in Australia and New Zealand </b>7th ed (LBC,
Sydney, 1996) pp 67 and 68.
<P>

56	Thus, although the deed in the instant case purports to be an absolute
assignment of all the legal and beneficial rights title
and interests of the
Speights, it operates only to transfer the ultimate interest in the Trust
Fund.
<P>

57	It should be noted that the way the deed is drawn the ultimate benefit in
the Trust Fund will not include any of the moneys that
may be recovered from
those responsible for the so-called Estate Mortgage debacle.  All that will be
left is what is left in the
Fund after the action is completed or the Trust
terminated, augmented if need be by any recovery from the present trustees of
the
Estate Mortgage Fighting Fund Trust.
<P>

58	It follows that questions 1 and 2 should be answered as follows:   1.
Yes;
<P>

2.	Yes, but it only operates so that the rights that the Speights otherwise had
to the ultimate distribution from the Fund is now
held by them in trust for the
plaintiff.  It does not operate so as to permit the plaintiff to maintain these
proceedings.
<P>

59	2A.	The real question here is whether a person must have locus standi at the
time the suit is instituted or whether by virtue
of Part 20 of the Supreme
Court Rules or otherwise, a suit can be saved if the plaintiff has locus standi
at the time of hearing.
<P>

60	The decision of Yeldham J in <b>Marshall v DG Sundin &amp; Co Pty Ltd
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2016%20NSWLR%20463" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 16 NSWLR 463</a>, and my own decision in <b>Darrington v Caldbeck
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2020%20NSWLR%20212" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 20 NSWLR 212</a>, seem to suggest that if a person does not have locus
standi at the date of institution of the suit, then the mere fact that he or
she gets standing at a later time such as by obtaining a grant of probate does
not affect the fact that initially the proceedings
were a nullity and as a
nullity cannot be validated.  
<P>

61	However, in <b>Farley and Lewers  Ltd v Attorney-General </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281962%29%2063%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20814" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1962) 63 SR
(NSW) 814</a>, the Court of Appeal, though holding that a local council did not
have standing to maintain an action, allowed an amendment to substitute
the
Attorney General as plaintiff.   It did this, as p 821 of the report shows,
under a special rule then in force that if proceedings
had been commenced
through a bona fide mistake in a doubtful case in the name of a wrong person a
plaintiff can be substituted. 
That rule no longer applies.  
<P>

62	In <b>Attorney-General v Beck </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20NSWLR%2077" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 2 NSWLR 77</a>, 93, Powell J said that
the proceedings in the <b>Farley and Lewers case </b>prior to the new plaintiff
being substituted could not have been a nullity because if they were, the Court
of Appeal could not have
done what it in fact did do.  He also noted that there
were like cases in England.  The defendant may at the relevant time move for
dismissal, but unless that happens the proper plaintiff can be substituted.

<P>

63	The proper plaintiff would have to be a person who had the right as at the
date of institution of the suit.  There does not appear
to be any authority
which would allow a person not entitled to the relief as at the date of
institution of the suit to be substituted
as plaintiff.
<P>

64	It follows that even if the Greenlees Assignment had a greater effect than
the Speight Assignment, it would not be sufficient
to entitle the present
plaintiff to maintain these proceedings. Question 2A is thus answered "No:  At
least not without further amendment".

<P>

65	3.	This question does not arise because the plaintiff has no locus standi to
raise it.
<P>

66	However, in case the matter should go elsewhere I will deal briefly with
some of the submissions that were made.
<P>

67	There are various provisions of trust law which are so basic to the concept
of a trust that a court of equity is loath to see
them by-passed.  These
principles include:
<P>

(1)	When a settlor parts with the trust property either by conveyance or
declaration of trust the settlor thereby relinquishes all
right title and
interest in the trust property save and except that which is reserved to the
settlor under the trust deed (Underhill
and Hayton <b>Law of Trusts and
Trustees </b>15th ed (Butterworths, London, 1995) p 6.
<P>

(2)	Up until the repeal of the Statute of Uses, the only effective way of
reserving to the settlor any power to alter the trusts
was to limit the trust
property in such a way that the trustees held to the use of the settlor in
certain circumstances or there
were shifting uses to take effect on certain
acts of the settlor.  Unless the power given to the settlor was explicitly
conferred
to occur from time to time the power could be exercised once only.
<P>

(3)	Essentially, a power to amend is part of the declaration of trust by the
settlor which is to be construed along with all the
other trusts in the
document.
<P>

(4)	It is difficult for a settlor to maintain that a power to amend or any
other power which prima facie contradicts other trusts
in the trust deed should
be permitted because a subsidiary trust repugnant to the main trust will be
considered to be void in equity.
<P>

(5)	The exercise of a power to amend cannot affect any vesting which has
already taken place.  This is because the power to alter
the trusts is itself
an interest in the Trust and its exercise cannot affect an already vested
interest.
<P>

(6)	Subject to principle (5), if a trust deed is drafted in a sufficiently wide
way a retrospective amendment will be valid:  <b>Gra-Ham Pty Ltd v Perpetual
Trustees WA Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%201%20WAR%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 1 WAR 65.</a>
<P>

68	What happened in this particular Trust does not measure up particularly well
against some of these principles.
<P>

69	There are also a series of other problems with this particular deed amongst
which are:
<P>

(1)	The trust deeds of 25 July and 3 August 1990 are not precisely in
accordance with what was told to the people contributing money
in the Hordern
Pavilion and it was on the basis of what they were told at that meeting that
they contributed their money on trust.
<P>

(2)	The scheme of the deed is that the trustees make the amendment on the
demand of the settlor, but at least one amendment was
not so made because the
trustees declined to do so and the settlor purported to put in new trustees and
make a new trust deed.
<P>

(3)	There are problems with the phrase "Unless all the beneficiaries agree" in
clause 9.1.  This has been interpreted by the settlor
as meaning that if one
beneficiary considers that the alteration does not prejudice the interests of
the beneficiaries, then the
stage can never be reached where all the
beneficiaries agree that it does so.  There would be good arguments for other
constructions.
<P>

(4)	The absence of the words "from time to time" in clause 9.1 and their
presence in clause 9.2 may mean that there can only be
one amendment to the
deed and not subsequent amendments whenever the settlor thinks it
appropriate.
<P>

70	However, having said all that, the plaintiff at present does not have
standing to get an answer to question 3.  In any event
a major hurdle to the
plaintiff would be to have the court hold that the settlor owes a duty to the
beneficiaries in and about exercising
the power to amend.  Prima facie there
would be no such obligation because as I have said earlier, the power to amend
is given beneficially
to the person concerned and not as a fiduciary power.
<P>

71	Accordingly, question 3 should merely be answered "This does not arise at
this stage."
<P>

72	4-6.	Do not arise.
<P>

73	7.	The deed of assignment between Greenlees and the plaintiff is in the same
form as the Speight Assignment.  Accordingly, exactly
the same problems
arise.
<P>

74	However, a different question of fact arises as to whether Mr Greenlees and
his wife were ever beneficiaries.
<P>

75	Mr Greenlees did give evidence.  He says that on 15 August 1990 he sent a
bank cheque for $100.  He sent that to the Sydney accountants
for the NSW
branch of the Trust.  He was appointed a member of the committee in August 1990
and in September 1990 became Vice-President
of the committee.  He resigned
about 13 May 1991.
<P>

76	Mr Bhagat says that there are no records of the Trust showing Mr Greenlees'
money having been received and that whilst it is
acknowledged he was
Vice-President of the committee, it must have been because everyone assumed
that a man of such profile in the
organisation had in fact made a donation.
<P>

77	It is more likely than not, especially in view of the inadequacy of many of
the records of the Sydney Trust, that Mr Greenlees
did make a payment of $100.
His affidavit really was not answered by the fact that Mr Bhagat did not have
records.
<P>

78	Accordingly I would find as a fact that Mr and Mrs Greenlees were
beneficiaries of the Trust at the date they entered into the
deed of
assignment.
<P>

79	However for the reasons already indicated, the question must be answered the
same way as question 2.
<P>

80	8.	This does not arise.
<P>

81	It would follow from the answers to these questions that no interim relief
should be given at present and that unless some move
is made by the plaintiff
in the near future, there is danger that the suit may be dismissed.
<P>

82	However, for the moment I will merely publish these reasons and the answers
to the questions and stand over the suit to be mentioned
on 16 July 1999 at 10
am which is the next occasion when the matters involving Estate Mortgage are
before me.
