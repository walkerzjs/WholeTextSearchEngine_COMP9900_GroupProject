<center><b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  
<P>

(<u>NOTE</u>: During the trial in this matter, I made an order that there be no
identification of the Prisoner other than by the pseudonym "K"
in any report of
the proceedings and later a further order that there be no publication of (the
names of) the persons named in the
departmental file (of the Department of
Community Services).  It is appropriate to limit that order to persons (other
than the deceased)
to whose care the Prisoner was entrusted over the years, and
to add the qualification "otherwise than by their initials".  I now
so order.
Consistently with that order, I intend to refer to such persons by their
initials. 
<P>

In large part these Reasons were prepared prior to any decision being made as
to the appropriate sentence to be imposed.  It is
convenient to continue to
refer to K as "the Prisoner", notwithstanding the order made prior to the
publication of these Reasons.)
<P>

1   	A decision as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed in
this case was difficult.  The circumstances presented starkly the
competing
requirements of deterrence and retribution on the one hand, and rehabilitation
and allowance for the subjective considerations
of the Prisoner on the other.
Ultimately I decided he should be placed on recognisance.  These are the
reasons for that decision.
<P>

2   	On 17 May last an indictment charging the Prisoner with the
murder of Geoffrey Boyson on or about 24 October 1996 was presented.
 The
Prisoner pleaded not guilty.  On 8 June a jury found him guilty of
manslaughter.
<P>

3   	In substance the issues in the trial were the partial legal
defences of provocation and diminished responsibility, doctrines
which have the
effect of reducing what would otherwise be murder to manslaughter.  The onus of
negativing the former beyond reasonable
doubt lay on the Crown.  The onus of
establishing the latter, albeit only on the balance of probabilities, lay on
the Prisoner. 
The jury's verdict does not disclose which of these issues was
resolved in favour of the Prisoner or, indeed, whether both were.
 Indeed,
these are matters I must decide - <b>R v Isaacs</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2041%20NSWLR%20374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 41 NSWLR 374</a> -
recognising where the onus of proof of each lies and what the standard of proof
of each is.
<P>

4   	I acknowledge also that quite separately from these
matters, before I can use any matter against the Prisoner I must be satisfied
of it beyond reasonable doubt.  In the resolution of these matters and those
referred to in the preceding paragraph issues, it may
be necessary for me to
reach conclusions on incidental issues that arise.  Except where those
conclusions are essential to a finding
which must be made beyond reasonable
doubt, it is not necessary that those incidental issues are determined to that
standard.  Having
stated this will be my approach, I shall not encumber these
Reasons with frequent references to the standard or onus of proof.
<P>

5   	The Prisoner was born on 2 January 1980.  He became a ward
of the State.  He and the deceased had become acquainted at Central
Railway
Station.  The Prisoner is recorded as lodging with the deceased in November
1995.  During 1996 the Prisoner expressed a wish
to live with the deceased and
took up residence there in or about late August 1996.  Representatives of the
Department of Community
Services visited and interviewed the deceased and had a
police record check carried out on him and the Department formally recognised
the deceased as the Prisoner's carer on 23 October 1996.  I use the term
"carer" advisedly.  That is the term on a document signed
by the Manager of the
Bowral branch of the Department of Community Services.  I am satisfied that in
so doing officers of the Department
felt that their hand was very largely
forced by the Prisoner who had absconded on a number of occasions from where he
should have
been and, despite agreeing not to go to Mr Boyson's to live until
all Departmental inquiries and processes were concluded, took himself
there at
the time I have indicated.
<P>

6   	According to Dr Wong, a psychiatrist who interviewed the
Prisoner for the purposes of the trial, the Prisoner told him that:-

<P>

"He had been with Geoff, the deceased, for about 2 months.  He spent most of
that period on the street, using drugs and doing crime
and spent very little
time with Geoff.  He used Geoff's place for drugs and was there only when they
used drugs together...  Geoff
brought back drugs which he had confiscated from
residents at the place he worked.  They gave each other drugs.  He said that
was
the basis of their relationship.  He was adamant that he would not have
gone to Geoff if he were not allowed to use drugs.
<P>

Their relationship deteriorated after Geoff raped him, "maybe a week, maybe two
weeks" before he was killed.  He raped him when
Tomi was using drugs and could
not do anything about it.  However, he did not want to tell me more about the
incident.
<P>

The next time he went back to Geoff was on the day when the killing took place.
He did not have any food or clothing and wanted
to go back to get his
belongings before he moved to Wollongong.  ... When he went back, Geoff was
using drugs and both of them used
drugs together.  Geoff was rubbing his crutch
and leg and said he was turning him on.  Tomi did not want the same thing
(rape) to
happen again and wanted him to leave him alone.  He told Geoff he was
getting something to eat and went into the kitchen.  He sat
there for 10
minutes, thinking of what to do.  He just wanted Geoff to leave him alone.  He
got a knife from a knife holder next
to the microwave.... He wanted to scare
him so that he would let him leave and "the thing" would not happen again.  As
he went out
Geoff was just standing up and waiting for him.  He then came
towards Tomi who stabbed him, just to scare him, he could not remember
where he
stabbed him."
<P>

7   	Although there were differences Dr Canaris, another
psychiatrist, was given a not dissimilar story.
<P>

8   	The deceased had homosexual, if not paedophiliac
tendencies.  Although the documents themselves were not in evidence, there
were
found in his apartment what would seem to have been classified advertisements
for two magazines - "Outrage" and "Campaign".
 Copies of those magazines were
tendered and they clearly are directed to the homosexual members of the
community.  Also found was
an index to advertisements in more common womens'
magazines.  The advertisements so indexed were of young children or babies,
naked
or semi-naked.  Although there are aspects of the evidence which must
cause one to consider the possibility that the Prisoner has
or had similar
tendencies, I am satisfied that he does and did not.  This conclusion is
supported by, inter alia, what the Prisoner
has said after the deceased's
death, by evidence from a Mr W with whom the Prisoner resided for a period, and
by the absence from
the numerous professional assessments of the Prisoner of
any finding to the effect that he had. 
<P>

9   	In regarding Mr W's evidence as supporting the conclusion
expressed in the last paragraph, I do not ignore evidence Mr W gave
as to the
desire and, at times, practice of the Prisoner to sleep in Mr W's bed.  However
I regard those matters as an indication
of the Prisoner's need for affection
rather than anything more.
<P>

10   	I am satisfied that a week or two or thereabouts before 24
October 1996, the deceased anally raped the Prisoner while the
latter was
intoxicated on alcohol and/or drugs.  Some time thereafter the Prisoner was at
a squat in Parramatta with an acquaintance,
Mr Stone.  The Prisoner looked down
in the dumps.  Mr Stone tried to find out what was wrong and conversation
which, despite Mr Stone's
expressed doubts, I am satisfied occurred with the
Prisoner along the following lines ensued:-
<P>

PRISONER		"What would you do if someone raped you?"
<P>

MR STONE		"In what way?"
<P>

PRISONER		"Rooted you and stuff like that?"
<P>

MR STONE		"I'd kill `em"
<P>

11   	On 24 October the Prisoner returned to Mr Boyson's unit.
He said to the two psychiatrists that this was to collect some of
his
belongings that were stored there.  There seem to have been such but be that as
it may and despite what happened, I am not prepared
to infer that the Prisoner
went to the deceased's unit with any intention of harming the deceased.
<P>

12   	Precisely what happened at the unit is not clear.  Apart
from the objective signs present when the police arrived 2 days later,
one is
largely dependent on what the Prisoner has said, either in cryptic accounts
given within a few days of the deceased's death
or to the psychiatrists on and
after 30 April 1999 against the background of his trial.  I am however
satisfied that the Prisoner's
account, which I find was given to Mrs Whitton on
28 October 1996, is substantially accurate so far as it goes.  
<P>

"Well, a while back Geoff got me stoned on drink and drugs and fucked me up the
arse twice.  Last Thursday, after I had drunk a
half bottle of scotch, Geoff
kept touching me on the leg and saying `You're making me horny' so I got up and
went to the kitchen
and cut his throat and stabbed him a few times."
<P>

13   	That he drank some whisky was also stated by the Prisoner
to Drs Wong and Canaris.  To the latter, the Prisoner said that
he got really
smashed.  To Dr Wong the Prisoner said that the two were using drugs.
<P>

14   	These references to what the Prisoner told Dr Wong and Dr
Canaris make it appropriate at this time to say something about
the reliability
of such statements.  Although venturing on matters logically dealt with below,
it is appropriate to record that both
psychiatrists formed the opinion that the
Prisoner was suffering from an abnormality of mind.  To the doctors the
Prisoner indicated
inability to remember in some areas and in a number of
respects there are differences in the detail of the history the doctors were
given.  In the result, I am not persuaded that all the Prisoner told the
doctors should be accepted, particularly where his account
to one doctor is the
only evidence on the topic.  
<P>

15   	Of the matters just mentioned, I am satisfied that the
Prisoner would have had drugs if they were available but, in light
of the fact
that it he seems not to have mentioned taking drugs that day to Dr Canaris, I
am not be prepared to find either that
they were or were not.  In light of the
mention to Mrs Whitton of half a bottle of whisky, I find that the Prisoner
consumed a significant
quantity while in the deceased's company.  However he
told Dr Wong that he could finish 2 to 3 bottles a day and I am not satisfied
that he was "smashed".  Obviously that is not a finding that he was not.  The
probabilities are that the whisky was supplied by the
deceased.
<P>

16   	Dr Wong understood that the rubbing or touching by the
deceased was of himself although according to what the Prisoner told
Dr Canaris
it was of the Prisoner.  I doubt that it matters.  I am satisfied that the
deceased attempted to seduce the Prisoner.
<P>

17   	When found, the deceased's body was nude and there is no
suggestion it was not in this condition when the deceased was attacked.
 There
is no evidence of when the deceased undressed, and some suggestion that he
commonly adopted this attitude of nudity in his
apartment.  Nor was there any
explanation given why, in light of the previous incident, the Prisoner
participated in drinking or
drug taking while at the deceased's unit.  That
said, explanation may exist in the Prisoner's lifestyle detailed above, or in
his
statements to Dr Wong that he drank heavily and could finish 2 to 3 bottles
of vodka or whisky in a day.
<P>

18   	The Prisoner went to the kitchen, took hold of a kitchen
knife and attacked the deceased.  The Prisoner inflicted a 135 mm
cut to the
deceased's throat, one stab wound to the head, penetrating the skull though not
the underlying membrane, and four stab
wounds to the upper right part of the
deceased's back.  These wounds varied in depth between 90 and 180 mm and three
of them penetrated
bones.  All four penetrated one of the deceased's lungs and
caused his death from loss of blood.  The nature and location of the
wounds
lead to the conclusion that at the time they were inflicted the Prisoner had
lost self-control. 
<P>

19   	From the injuries to the deceased, the fact his body was
found in the kitchen and the distribution of blood in the unit, I
would infer
the attack occurred, at least in part, in the lounge room or thereabouts. 
<P>

20   	According to what the Prisoner told Dr Wong he
unsuccessfully searched the unit for a key, took some clothes and the remains
of a bottle of whisky he and the deceased had been drinking and left the unit
by climbing over the balcony.  I accept that this is
what occurred.
<P>

21   	At 9.32 pm on 24 October 1996, the Prisoner made a call to
000 from a public telephone close to the deceased's premises. 
In it he said
something to the following effect:-
<P>

"Hello (would I get) I'd like to report a murder at erm 11/3, London Street,
Enmore.  Anonymous caller.  A murder someone's been
stabbed."
<P>

22   	At some time between about 1.00 am and 8.20 am on 25
October, the Prisoner left a message on the deceased's answering machine.
 The
message was:-
<P>

"Yeah, Geoff.  Its me, Tomi.  I'll be back home in a week. O.K.  Bye."
<P>

23   	In the period between the deceased's death and the evening
of 26 October, the Prisoner again joined Mr Stone at the squat
at Parramatta.
On this occasion conversation to the following effect occurred:-
<P>

Q	What did he say to you?
<P>

A	That he killed someone because he got raped.
<P>

Q	What were the words he said to you?
<P>

A	He said "I done it."
<P>

Q	Were they the first words he uttered?: "I done it?
<P>

A	Yeah.
<P>

Q	What did you say in response to that?
<P>

A	"Done what?"
<P>

Q	What did he say?
<P>

A	"Killed the bloke I was living with because he raped me."
<P>

24   	At about 7.25 pm on 26 October 1996 the Prisoner made
another call from a public phone again some few blocks from the deceased's
premises.  In it the Prisoner said:-
<P>

"Hello.  There's been a murder at 11/3 London Street, Enmore.  They've killed a
person, erm, I dunno.  I done it."
<P>

25   	At about 7.30 pm on that day the Prisoner arrived at the
block in which the deceased's unit was situate.  In consequence of
concerns
held by people who worked with the deceased, the police were already there.  In
response to inquiry the Prisoner informed
the police that he lived at unit 11
with Geoffrey Boyson.  In the course of further questioning the Prisoner said
that he had been
camping for a week and had just got back.  After a little time
he went with police to the police station.  Because of his age it
was necessary
for there to be present at any questioning an adult not connected with the
police force.  When the officer in charge
of the investigation, a Detective
Jackson, approached the Prisoner to tell him that arrangements in that regard
had been made the
Prisoner said "I stabbed him".  Detective Jackson said
"What?" and the Prisoner said:-
<P>

" I stabbed him.  I stabbed him `cause he was fucking me up the arse."
<P>

26   	On 28 October at the Bidura Children's Court the Prisoner
made the statement to Mrs Whitton which I have recounted above.
<P>

27   	I turn to the issue of provocation.
<P>

<b>PROVOCATION</b>
<P>

28   	Pursuant to s23of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>, an act is done
under provocation where:-
<P>

(a) 	the act is the result of a loss of self-control on the part of the accused
that was induced by conduct of the deceased (including
grossly insulting words
or gestures) towards or affecting the accused; and
<P>

(b) 	that conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary
person, not intoxicated, in the position of the accused
to have so far lost
self-control as to have formed an intent to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily
harm upon, the deceased.
<P>

29   	It was submitted on behalf of both the Crown and the
Prisoner that I should find that the Crown had not disproved that the
Prisoner's offence was committed in such circumstances.  I so find.  Indeed I
am satisfied that the circumstances of the Prisoner's
offence fulfil the
criteria stated.
<P>

30   	So far as paragraph (a) is concerned, I need add nothing
to what I have said above.  I should say more concerning the matters
encompassed in paragraph (b).  Any rape, be it of a man or a woman, is a gross
violation of the victim.  Although it is no longer
a crime, anal intercourse is
to many members of the community both revolting and degrading.  It is even more
so when it is inflicted
without free and willing consent.  In my view anal rape
could well, in some circumstances, induce an ordinary person, not intoxicated,
to so far lose self-control as to form an intent to kill, or to inflict
grievous bodily harm upon the rapist. 
<P>

31   	Here of course, there was an appreciable passage of time -
a week or two or thereabouts - between the rape and the deceased's
death - time
enough, it may be argued, for anyone's emotions to cool down.  However one must
also take into account the fact that
the deceased displayed an indication of
repeating his actions - conduct calculated to rekindle any adverse reaction in
a victim.
 Furthermore, regard must be had to "the position of the accused".
To put the provocation into perspective, to appreciate its content,
extent and
gravity, one must consider the position of the accused, including his "age,
sex, ... personal attributes, personal relationships
and past history" -
<b>Masciantonio v R</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/67.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 67</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20183%20CLR%2058" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 183 CLR 58</a> at 67.
<P>

32   	"The position of the accused" is in this case, a matter of
some significance.  I will detail it more when I come to deal with
his
circumstances rather than the circumstances of the offence.  It is sufficient
for present purposes to say that he has had an
exceedingly emotionally deprived
background, in his early years was let down badly by those whose obligation was
to care for him
and, at the time of the offence had and had had so little in
terms of personal relationships or achievements that to be anally raped
was
likely to be especially degrading and provocative.  The prospect of being
subjected to, or even a fitting candidate for, a second
instance of anal
intercourse may well not have been less so. 
<P>

33   	The need of the Prisoner for his belongings provides a
sufficient explanation for his return to the deceased's unit.  Not
as readily
explicable is his participating in drinking and, possibly drug taking while he
was there.  But that said, regard must
be had to his past and these matters do
not incline me to the view that the Crown has excluded the defence of
provocation.
<P>

34   	Given that these reasons are concerned with the question
of sentence and not guilt, it is appropriate that I say something
about the
weight I am disposed to give to the topic of provocation.  The myriad of
circumstances to be considered in any case of
provocation mean that it is
difficult to compare quantitatively one case with another.  However it is
appropriate to say that, while
I do not regard this case as in a worst category
so far as the victim's conduct is concerned, I put it high on that scale and,
when
one has regard to the position of the Prisoner faced with that
provocation, one where the provocation was very high.  Furthermore,
his history
summarised in some detail below, makes his loss of self control much more
easily understood and more excusable than in
the case of the vast majority of
the community who have far greater reserves of emotional stability to draw
upon.
<P>

<b>DIMINISHED RESPONSIBILITY</b>
<P>

35   	It was submitted on behalf of the Prisoner that I should
also find that Diminished Responsibility, as that concept was expressed
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s23a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s23A</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> in October 1996, has been established on the balance of
probabilities.  The Crown opposed such a finding.  So far as is relevant,
at
the time <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s23a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s23A</a> provided:
<P>

"(1) Where, on the trial of a person for murder, it appears that at the time of
the acts or omissions causing the death charged
the person was suffering from
such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or
retarded development of mind
or any inherent cause of induced by disease or
injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for the acts or
omissions,
he shall not be convicted of murder" (but of manslaughter).
<P>

36   	Both Dr Wong and Dr Canaris formed the opinion that at the
time of his offence the Prisoner was suffering from an abnormality
of mind
which answered the description within that provision although they differed in
their description of what it was.  There is
little which would justify
rejection of the common view of these psychiatrists and indeed the Crown did
not suggest that there is
any.  The sole aspect of the doctrine with which the
Crown took issue was whether the Prisoner's abnormality of mind substantially
impaired the Prisoner's mental responsibility for the acts causing death.
<P>

37   	That is an issue on which medical evidence is not
decisive.  Indeed it has been said that "expert medical evidence is not
really
of great assistance in determining" it - <b>Trotter</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2068%20A%20Crim%20R%20536" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 68 A Crim R 536.</a>
Nevertheless, in the circumstances of this case, it seems to me necessary to
pay significant regard to the medical evidence, although
I confess at the
outset to having difficulty in accepting some of it.  That difficulty does not
arise through any preference for
either Dr Wong or Dr Canaris as witnesses but
rather from the content of what they said.
<P>

38   	Dr Canaris thought that Prisoner's abnormality of mind
substantially impaired the Prisoner's mental responsibility for the
acts
causing death.  However, the weight I am disposed to give to this opinion is
reduced by at least four matters in his own evidence.
 Firstly, I am
disinclined to accept his diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,
principally for the reasons advanced by Dr
Wong in answer to some questions by
myself and in particular the reason that there is no evidence that the
Prisoner, prior to killing
Mr Boyson, commonly re-experienced any traumatic
event.  Secondly, having examined all of the DOCS file at length, I am
unpersuaded
that in his past the Prisoner suffered anything like the amount of
sexual abuse to which Dr Canaris seems to refer.  I remain unpersuaded
that he
suffered any, a conclusion which echoes what the Prisoner told Dr Wong although
I have arrived at it by a different route.
<P>

39   	In that regard, it is proper to recognise that there are a
significant number of references to sexual abuse within the documents
in the
Department of Community Services (DOCS) file.  However a close and
chronological examination of them provides a good illustration
of what happens
to an account when it passes through a number of hands.  References to primary
material tells a story different from
later versions.  (Although I do not rely
on the fact - because I have no need to do so and because there is something to
be said
for the view that the mind may bury traumatic events - I note that the
Prisoner told Ms Jones of the Department of Juvenile Justice
that he had no
memory of sexual abuse.)
<P>

40   	Thirdly, in response to some questions from me, Dr Canaris
indicated that if conversation to the effect of that deposed to
by Mr Stone had
occurred, he would have some doubt as to the significance of the defence of
diminished responsibility "not because
of the conversation per se as such, but
because I am now offered a history very inconsistent with the history that the
defence case
has which makes me wonder whether I can believe what he is telling
me.  You know, I have to then ask myself: well, is he telling
me about a pack
of lies about his mental condition."
<P>

41   	Fourthly, a little later Dr Canaris indicated, in effect,
that if the events leading up to the killing of the deceased included
the
suggestion by Mr Stone to the Prisoner of killing the deceased, that suggestion
may have influenced the Prisoner towards forming
an intention to kill and that
possibility reduced his confidence in any diagnosis of operative diminished
responsibility.  In so
expressing Dr Canaris' conclusion, I have departed from
the terms of statements to the effect "I would find it an uphill battle to
come
up with diminished responsibility" but because of the less than perfect clarity
in the questions and answers on this topic I
think what I have said more
accurately expresses the tenor of Dr Canaris' evidence.  Dr Canaris did agree
that any judgment of the
impact of Mr Stone's statement to the effect "I would
kill him" on the Prisoner depends to a significant degree on what view one
forms as to the details of the events that follow.  He went on to say that the
impact on the Prisoner depended also on his state
of mind at the time of asking
"what would you do if someone were raping you" and what he was actually
thinking at the time of the
killing.  On that latter topic, the only express
evidence is what the Prisoner told the two psychiatrists and Mrs Whitton.
<P>

42   	Dr Wong was of the view that the Prisoner's abnormality of
mind did not substantially impair his mental responsibility for
the acts
causing death.  He expressed his conclusion in these terms:-
<P>

"... If Tomi's version is accurate, his ability to exercise control over his
physical acts at the time of the alleged killing did
not appear to be impaired.
According to him, he sat in the kitchen for 10 minutes pondering what to do
before he committed the stabbing.
 Admittedly, the deceased had 6 stab wounds
whereas Tomi did not suffer any significant injury and told the police the
deceased did
not fight back.  However, I do not feel we can conclude from this
that the attack was one committed under impaired control.
<P>

I have some difficulty in convincing myself that the version of events given by
Tomi is a reliable one... However, on the basis
of such information as is
available to me, I have no reason to believe that his ability to exercise
control over his physical act
was significantly impaired at the time.  He did
not appear to be unduly prone to impulsive behaviour.  Even when he was very
keen
to live with Geoff, he was prepared to wait until the necessary
arrangements were made."
<P>

43   	The statement in the last sentence is wrong.  Although the
Prisoner said that he was prepared to wait, a consideration of
the Department
of Community Services File relating to the Prisoner shows that he did not.  The
file also refers to incidents which
to my mind do indicate impulsive behaviour,
although whether such incidents were sufficient in number or degree to indicate
that
the Prisoner was unduly prone in that regard is not a matter which was
canvassed or on which I find it necessary to reach a conclusion.

<P>

44   	In light of the Prisoner's statement to Dr Wong of
spending some 10 minutes in the kitchen contemplating his course of action
and
his failure to give evidence disavowing or explaining that, I must, I think,
proceed on the assumption that some such event may
have occurred.  I say that
notwithstanding I share Dr Wong's reservations concerning this matter and I
certainly do not regard the
10 minute estimate, given some years after the
event as in any way reliable.  However, Dr Wong does not address the difference
between
the Prisoner's actions or thought in the kitchen when his control may
not have been impaired and his actions in stabbing the deceased,
when, judged
by the injuries, in my opinion self control was impaired.  This omission makes
me unwilling to simply accept Dr Wong's
conclusion. 
<P>

45   	I am thrown back, it seems, largely onto my own judgment
on the issue.  The conclusion at which I have arrived is that the
Prisoner's
abnormality of mind did substantially impair his mental responsibility for the
acts causing death.  My reasons are as
follows.  Firstly, the Prisoner did have
an abnormality of mind.  Dr Wong described it as "gross psychiatric
disturbance".  Dr Canaris
described the Prisoner as "a  profoundly disturbed
individual (who had suffered) an innumerable series of severe psychological
traumas".
 The Prisoner's history and other psychiatric and psychological
assessments to which I refer below satisfy me that these are not
overstatements.  Secondly, that history and those assessments indicate that the
Prisoner was very ill equipped to cope with stress
which impacted on him
personally.  It is inescapable that this deficiency was part of his abnormality
of mind.  Thirdly, even if
his relationship with Mr Boyson was primarily
dictated by a common interest in drugs and the freedom which Mr Boyson afforded
the
Prisoner, as the latter seemed to indicate to Dr Wong, I have no doubt that
Mr Boyson's actions were but another of the many and
gross disappointments by
which the Prisoner's life to that time had been dominated.  Fourthly, it was
against this background that
the Prisoner did lose self control.
<P>

46   	In this concomitance of circumstances it seems to me
probable that not only did the Prisoner's abnormality of mind contribute
to the
acts causing death but did so to such an extent as to substantially impair his
mental responsibility for the acts causing
death.
<P>

47   	It may not be inappropriate to observe that to some
degree, and despite my reservations, this chain of reasoning bears some
similarity with that of Dr Canaris where he said:-
<P>

"I also believe that your client could avail himself of the defence of
diminished responsibility.  Even if your client may have
seemed cool, calm and
collected on the day in question and over the next few days, the anger he would
have experienced would have
been far in excess of anything which the putative
normal person could expect to control.  Furthermore, as a profoundly damaged
individual,
he would have been far less equipped to contain such anger that an
ordinary person who had hitherto led an ordinary life.  His capacity
to judge
his situation correctly and to control his impulse to kill would have been
substantially impaired.  Unlike an ordinary person,
his personal boundaries
would have been grossly disrupted by the cumulative impact of childhood sexual
and physical abuse, gross
emotional deprivation, institutional abuse and life
on the streets."
<P>

48   	In coming to the view I have, I do not forget that the
Prisoner carries the onus on the issue of diminished responsibility,
that he
did not give evidence during the trial or on sentence, his statements to the
effect that he approached the deceased with
a conscious plan of action in mind
- "to scare him" - that he had been drinking and perhaps drug taking, and seems
to have exhibited
some thought in and about leaving the deceased's unit.
Nevertheless, my conclusion on this topic is as I have indicated.
<P>

49   	So far as the Prisoner's actions in and about leaving the
unit are concerned, the Crown placed reliance on the Prisoner's
actions after
stabbing the deceased in, inter alia, collecting some of his clothing, the
bottle whisky and a bag and in then climbing
down a series of balconies from
the deceased's unit to the ground.  These actions demonstrated, so it was said,
possession of the
Prisoner's faculties.  The latter proposition may be
accepted, although questions arise whether they were in a fully normal state
and whether the killing of the deceased may not have had the effect of sobering
the Prisoner up to some extent.  And it must also
be borne in mind that the
Prisoner left his wallet and watch in the deceased's bathroom - an action or
omission calculated to identify
him and indicative of some degree of haste,
thoughtlessness or panic.  I do not find in the Prisoner's actions at the unit
after
the deceased's death any guide to the issues which I have to decide.
<P>

<b>Subjective Circumstances</b>
<P>

50   	I turn to the subjective circumstances of the Prisoner.
His history prior to going to live with the deceased is the subject
of
extensive record in files of the Department of Community Services.  It makes
appalling reading but bears detailed reference.
<P>

51   	The Prisoner was born on 2 January 1980.  His mother was
an alcoholic and had been one while carrying the Prisoner and his
sister Suzie
born in May 1978.  Departmental records show that on a number of occasions
during 1980 when officers of the Department
visited the home, they found it
littered with rubbish, food scraps, beer and other alcoholic drink bottles,
cigarette butts, unwashed
plates and cutlery and clothes.
<P>

52   	In June 1980 the Prisoner was hospitalised for severe
nappy rash after his mother was found unconscious outside a local hotel.
 A Dr
Waterlow recorded that between the Prisoner's birth and 18 June 1980 the
Prisoner presented as generally unkempt, not well
cared for and a very unhappy
baby whose mental age was beginning to lag.  When admitted to hospital at that
time he lay miserably
in his cot and did not interact with staff.  Tests
carried out showed there was then considerable delay in his personal, social
and
language development.  His development advanced whilst in hospital but
following discharge he showed signs of regression.
<P>

53   	In August 1980 the Prisoner's mother left the children
with her parents and disappeared.  In that month the two children were
placed
in an institution when their mother and grandmother were found in a drunken
disorderly state.  After 3 weeks in the institution
a marked improvement was
observed in the case of both children.  In September 1980 it was recorded that
Suzie suffered from late
development in consequence of the drinking habits of
her mother during pregnancy, was exceptionally small, was unable to speak and
uttered only single syllables.  The Prisoner's development was noted also to be
slowing.  On 24 November 1980 the Prisoner was recorded
as being considerably
behind developmentally.
<P>

54   	The Prisoner was made a ward of the State on 11 November
1980.  On 8 December 1980 he and his sister were placed with foster
parents.
The considerable criticism of these persons in the Departmental files to which
it will be necessary to refer, and the absence
of any opportunity to respond to
that criticism are among the reasons it is appropriate to refer to these
persons as Mr and Mrs B.
<P>

55   	Apart from some emotional instability during the settling
in period the Prisoner apparently settled down well initially and
showed
considerable improvement in his developmental level.  However in March 1981 he
began to suffer convulsions intermittently.
 Later Dilantin was recommended,
and in October 1983 it was noted that he had been free from seizures for the
last few months.  In
May 1981 he was recorded as having temper tantrums and
breath holding attacks.
<P>

56   	In 1984 and 1985, the Prisoner was seen by a Mr Robertson,
a psychologist.  He recorded a good relationship and communication
between the
Prisoner and Mr and Mrs B and that the Prisoner appeared to be stopping a habit
of putting things in his mouth.  In July
1985 Mr Robertson recorded that he had
seen both children fairly regularly and the initial improvement appears to have
remained.
 Because Mr and Mrs B were concerned about unusual behaviour of both
children - Suzie's overt sexual behaviour and the Prisoner's
propensity towards
eating almost anything - Mr Robertson recommended thorough psychiatric and
neurological assessment.
<P>

57   	In June 1985 the Prisoner's kindergarten teacher for the
year recorded his eating of glue, plasticine dirt, plant, blue tack,
pencils
and crayons without any apparent fear of harming himself and as an almost self
punitive attention getting device.  He was
often disruptive to class routine
due, she felt, to a very limited concentration span and thereby alienated
himself from others.
 She recorded the depositing of urine and faeces in wash
bowls and that he didn't seem to register shame or fear of reprimand.  Asked
why, he would reply, "I don't know." then a strange smirk would appear on his
face.  He had been reprimanded for injuring other children
with sticks and
throwing stones and again showed no shame, fear of reprimand or awareness of
the wrongness of his actions.
<P>

58   	In August 1985 the Prisoner was the subject of assessment
and a detailed report from a paediatric neurologist at the Westmead
Neurological Centre.  The history recorded, given by Mr and Mrs B, included the
statement that a major problem was the Prisoner's
self destructiveness.  He
would hang upside down on a monkey bar and fall directly on his head, bites his
fingers, gouge his eyes
and had been seen to rub his feet into glass on the
floor:  He constantly talked about death and tried to kill or hurt small
animals
and insects:  He ate inappropriate things including cockroaches:  He
was constantly disruptive in class with hyperactive behaviour
and poor
concentration:  He attempted to attract attention by putting his head in the
toilet bowl and urinating on the floor:  He
was not very affectionate and
indifferent to praise or physical or verbal punishment:  Convulsions were
generally but not always
provoked.  
<P>

59   	There were no focal signs on neurological examination.
The final paragraph of the report reads:-
<P>

"In summary, Suzie and Tomi are both extremely disturbed children who came from
a very deprived background.  Their behaviour is
typical of that classically
described in children with this degree of deprivation including excessive
eating of normal and abnormal
things as well as the lack of affect and any
sense of guilt or responsibility.  I should think that the prognosis for the
children
from a psychological point of view is very dismal indeed.
Unfortunately, the foster parents have been trying to tell the Youth and
Community Services for many years how disturbed these children are and have
gotten very far (sic).  I certainly do not think there
is any evidence that
there a neurological disease (sic) except for the brain damage and clumsiness
which are the result of the alcohol
exposure during pregnancy."
<P>

60   	Departmental reports of October 1985 record the making of
a decision to remove the children on the recommendation of a social
worker and
Dr Dudley of the Department of Psychiatry of the Royal Alexandra Hospital for
Children, and that Mrs B said that she could
not cope with Suzie for another 3
months.  By November Mrs B is recorded as saying that if alternative placement
was not arranged
within 3 days, Suzie would be left at the office of the
Department of Community Services.  On 14 November 1985 Suzie was brought
to the
office and then taken to Minali, which was apparently a departmental home.
<P>

61   	An assessment of 1 November 1985 by Dr Dudley refers to
Suzie having foetal alcohol syndrome but both children having "gross
behavioural, emotional, educational and cognitive problems ... explicable on
the basis of the grossest abuse and disruption of attachment
in their early
years".  The Prisoner's problems, I infer as described by the Bs, are noted as
encopresis (depositing faeces in abnormal
places), pica (eating of
non-nutritive substances), self injuring and dangerous behaviour, destructive
behaviour, some precocious
sexual interest, and lying.  The report continues
"The Bs have attempted to restore the deficiency with little support" and that
further neuro-psychological assessment is needed as is residential help, and
that this was being sought for Suzie at Bernardo's and
for Tomi at Arndell (I
infer, another departmental institution).
<P>

62   	In December 1985 a report of a clinical psychologist. Mr
Said, recorded:-
<P>

"Tomi's general intellectual ability is clearly in the average range and his
ability to learn, retain and recall auditory verbal
material is also normal.
However on the McCarthy memory and motor scales (which measure attention and
immediate recall) Tomi scored
below the normal range and these scores indicate
problems with attention, concentration and co-ordination.  There is no
indication
that these problems are caused by organic impairment and they are
most likely caused by disruptive early development and current
emotional
problems."
<P>

63   	The Prisoner and his sister were the subject of a report
by Mr Defina, another psychologist, sometime after 3 March 1986.
 This document
refers to reports on file indicating Mrs B had unrealistic expectations and her
management of children was incompetently
inappropriate and the behaviour of the
children deteriorated.  On testing Tomi was well behaved but clumsy and
possibly coached.
 He displayed attachment to Mr B.  Tomi perceived Mrs B as
being ambivalent towards him.  One test indicated Tomi had a pre-occupation
with being punished often over trivial incidents.  He saw himself as being
isolated within a fairly hostile environment.  "Taking
(other tests) into
account, it would appear that Tomi feels quite insecure in this present
placement.  The weight of evidence suggests
that this is due to an
unsatisfactory, punishing relationship between himself and the Bs rather than
to any fears he may have of
being removed from their care."
<P>

64   	Tomi's general intellectual abilities were diagnosed as in
the average range but he displayed poor concentration and co-ordination.
 The
report continued:-
<P>

"Tomi is now nearly 6 and has been in the care of the Bs for more than 5 years.
The weight of psychological research demonstrates
clearly that early trauma, on
its own, does not lead to irreversible damage.  It is only when that trauma is
just the first link
in a whole chain of unfortunate experiences, or when the
child is subjected to some continuing pathological influence that remains
throughout a large part of childhood, that more permanent effects are likely to
emerge.  Clearly, then, if Tomi had been receiving
appropriate, quality care,
his condition should have improved rather than deteriorated as it has.
<P>

... There were implications of possible sexual abuse.  I believe the assessment
by Arndell (apparently another departmental home)
also raised this possibility.
I stress that the evidence for possible sexual abuse is implicit only and does
not constitute grounds
for believing or assuming that it has occurred.
<P>

It appears that Tomi's present condition is likely to have had its roots in
early trauma, but that the effects of that trauma have
been maintained and
probably exacerbated by the care he has received since being placed with the
Bs.
<P>

... Reports on file indicate that Mrs B acted in a manner contrary to that
required by the therapists.
<P>

... The overwhelming need in this case is for Tomi to undergo therapy.  ...  It
is more important to maintain the relationship between
Suzie and Tomi than the
relationship between Tomi and the Bs.  ... I see no alternative in this case
than to remove Tomi from his
present placement."
<P>

65   	On 4 March 1986 the Prisoner was removed from the Bs and
taken to Minali.  By June 1986 he was residing at the Bernardo's
Lindfield unit
for severely emotionally disturbed children.  There his conduct seems to have
improved although in April 1987 it was
recorded that his "behaviours are still
inconsistent and do not appear to follow a significantly predictable pattern"
and "When Tomi
first entered the unit he was very closed and hostile towards
physical affection. ... He will now allow people to give him a cuddle."
 In
that month he and his sister were then placed with another foster carer, Miss
W.
<P>

66   	A report of 10 June 1987 indicates that this placement
seems to have then been progressing well although much work remained
to be
done.  A note of 4 April 1987 and an undated application to the Director
General of Health and Community Services for approval
to continue paying a
triple boarding out allowance but which bears a supporting recommendation dated
21 March 1988 says, "the two
children are very difficult management problems
who require intensive and continuous care which is far beyond that required for
a
ward in normal circumstances".  The departmental files seem to contain little
by way of records in this June 1987 to February 1988
period.  Minutes of a case
conference on 15/3/88 seem to be missing although a note on the submission to
which I have referred records
that at the case conference, restoration in
March/April was still the confirmed case plan.
<P>

67   	The Departmental records indicate that by 1986 the
Prisoner's natural mother was leading a much more stable life and in February
1986 was coping admirably with 3 other children.  Restoration to the natural
mother was recommended if that was in the interests
of the Prisoner and Suzie.
This aim seems to have played a large part in Departmental thinking from that
time onwards and on 18 March
1988 restoration occurred.  This was despite the
matters referred to in the preceding paragraph, despite the enormous increase
in
pressure 5 children rather than 3 would impose, and a case conference note
on 3 March 1986 that the Prisoner's mother appeared to
be avoiding much of the
responsibility which caused the Prisoner and Suzie to become wards and for the
lack of contact which followed.
 It is however appropriate to record also that
on 21 August, the District Officer observed that the mother was increasingly
taking
responsibility for these events.
<P>

68   	Both children were discharged from the Minister's
guardianship in November 1988.  However by March 1990, the Prisoner's conduct
had deteriorated sufficiently for him to be referred by a local doctor to the
Fairfield Community Health Centre.  By November the
natural mother and her
husband were unable to cope and in December it was recorded that the Prisoner
was very emotionally disturbed,
running away and placing himself in danger and
sniffing turpentine or some other substance.  His behaviour at school led to
him being
suspended.  On 14 December 1990 he was again placed at Minali.
<P>

69   	Another psychologist, Barbara Kennett, examined him in
January 1991.  She reported:-
<P>

"(Tests) indicated that Tomi has a poor self image ... .
<P>

He did not have his dependency needs met when younger and this means that he is
unable to trust adults.  He views the world as a
rather threatening place and
certainly nothing in his history has assisted in disabusing him of this
fear.
<P>

Much of his behaviour is attention seeking which he learned during his first
six years of life.  When Tomi feels secure and is not
pressured into showing
emotional responses his behaviour falls within the normal range.  This has been
seen several times, when he
was with the (W)s' (sic) and again at Minali.
However, when placed under any stress he responds with the earlier noted
aberrant behaviours.
<P>

Tomi lacks the personal resources to deal with emotional pressures."
<P>

70   	The minutes of a departmental case conference of 11
February 1991 record that Tomi's parents - (This probably means his mother
and
her husband - not the Prisoner's father.) - were agreeable to wardship and were
unable to care for him.  It is also noted that
the "any move for Tomi to other
alternative care should be his first and last placement due to his fragile
emotional state and vulnerability
..."
<P>

71   	On 23 April 1991 the Prisoner was again declared a ward
under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Care and Protection) Act 1987</a>.  On 29 April he was
transferred to Renwick, a departmental institution at Mittagong.  While there
he absconded on a number of occasions
in the company of other boys, on one
occasion being found at Kings Cross.  In December he was informed by his
step-father that he
could not go home even for a visit and his natural mother
refused to have him home for Christmas.  In a report of 11 March 1992,
Dr
Moore, a psychiatrist, was to refer to this incident as one which was
"following his ultimate rejection in the Christmas holiday
period".  On 16
December 1991 he was involved with the theft of a bag on a beach and on 18
December he burnt his arm badly with a
cigarette lighter.  
<P>

72   	In January 1992 the Prisoner was involved in two offences
of breaking entering and stealing and one car theft.  A file note
records that
he was angry, hurt and disappointed that, despite some promises by his mother,
he could not go home - a circumstance
for which he blamed his step-father.
Tomi requested the phone number of his natural father who he believed could
care for him.  (The
pathos in this request becomes apparent when it is
recognised that there seems to have been no contact between the two for many
years.)
<P>

73   	The note records:-
<P>

"Cottage staff report Tomi's behaviour continues to deteriorate and he is now
openly defiant, verbally abusive and sullen when checked.
<P>

... Intense therapy is vital, but ineffective until a permanent placement is
found. ...Stability, security and a clear map of his
future is essential to him
at this point of time."
<P>

74   	I have referred briefly to a report of 11 March 1992 by Dr
Marilyn Moore.  The report bears further attention.  In it Dr Moore
records:-
<P>

"... He was uncertain why he had come to see me and seemed indifferent about
it.  He showed no spontaneity or interest in anything.
 He replied woodenly and
with little reflection, to questions.  As the interview progressed he smiled
occasionally.  He showed no
anxiety, indeed he appeared to be affectively
constricted.
<P>

He told me that nothing makes him happy or sad "I've been through so much that
I don't know who I feel any more."  He used to get
angry with his step-father
but he doesn't now - "I don't care any more".
<P>

... Tomi maintained he would not remember any one special from any of his
placements.  He does not care for any one in particular
at Renwick.
Concentration and attention were sustained throughout the interview.  Tomi
seemed to be of average intelligence.
<P>

Tomi had been severely emotionally deprived for much of his life. ... His view
of his mother seems ambivalent with a tendency to
idealise her in her absence,
tempered by the realism of being with her.  Contact with her has been erratic
and unpredictable so that
Tomi does not trust others.  I do not think that Tomi
has an internal concept of a family.
<P>

Apart from his brief burst of self-destructiveness and antisocial activity
following his mother's latest unexpected rejection of
him, Tomi has showed
least emotional disturbance when placed in an environment where there are no
emotional expectations placed on
him e.g. at Minali and Renwick.  His behaviour
has settled again at Renwick.
<P>

Given his history, I do not believe that he would do well in a normal family
setting where there would be emotional expectations
of him.  He would be very
reluctant to trust and would be likely to display some anxious needy behaviours
again, (such as pica or
stealing).  The possible advantage of gaining some
family life needs to be weighed up against the stresses for him of such a
placement
which might well end in yet another rejection for him (because his
needy behaviours are aberrant).
<P>

He does not seem to be clinically depressed, rather he has an "empty" quality
about him.  He is likely to develop a personality
disorder, possibly of an
avoidant type."
<P>

75   	File notes of 1 and 19 June 1992 written by the
department's District Officer record that "Tomi appears to be more confused
and
distressed about his current situation and his mother's refusal of contact than
ever.  He seems fearful of his future, which
at this stage is still uncertain."
and that "Tomi's sense of loss and grief re his family are, at times, quite
overwhelming for the
child, and he needs to be encouraged to vent his anger and
despair.  Within the last week we have been advised that Turner Cottage
(where
the Prisoner was living) is to close in the next few weeks and Tomi has been
quite devastated by this news and insists he
must stay with his house master
... and the other Turner boys - `quite interesting for a child who lacks
attachment/significant others'
(sic)."
<P>

76   	Throughout 1992 up until September there were numerous
instances of absconding and other significant misconduct, including
stealing.
On at least 2 occasions he went to his natural mother.  She instigated his
return and reports indicate that he was somewhat
traumatised by what seemed to
be double messages from her.  In October Jackie Cope, a psychologist reported,
inter alia, that
<P>

"In the absence of his father Tomi seems to have idealised his image of his
father.
<P>

"Tomi appears so desperate to have someone to care for him that he fantasises
about attaching to a variety of Aboriginal or "Street
People". ... 
<P>

"Tomi is desperately searching for parents who will care for him."
<P>

77   	In December 1992, apparently at the instigation of the
department, the Prisoner commenced to spend weekends with Mr W who
lived in the
highlands south of Sydney.  On 13 January 1993 he was discharged from Renwick
into Mr W's care.  Although as might be
expected there were some difficulties,
things seem to have gone fairly well during 1993.  However a report on file
dated 1 July 1994
reads:-
<P>

"Tomi became very aggressive.  (Mr) W distressed - Tomi threw tools from roof -
wants to move as sick of chooks and (mr W) - (Mr
W) constantly touched Tomi -
unable to detach himself emotionally - he should give Tomi space."  
<P>

78   	Later that month the Prisoner received a letter from his
mother which concluded "Lots of Love" and he absconded, though not
necessarily
in that order.  A report of 22 July 1994 records that he had been indulging in
bouts of attention seeking behaviour at
intervals of approximately 3 months
since his placement, that this behaviour had recently escalated and included
setting fires, destruction
of property, some violence and stealing.  On 26 July
he was involved with others in throwing rocks at glass doors and windows
belonging
to the St Vincent de Paul society, causing $2,000 worth of damage.
On 6 August he was reported to be sniffing again.  On 9 August
he was asked to
leave a recreation room at Minali.  He declined, kicked a plate glass door,
then picked up a concrete slab and threw
it through another plate glass door.
He was again charged.  He absconded but after a few days gave himself up to
police.
<P>

79   	In early August 1994 Barbara Kennett prepared another
psychological report.  In it she records that that during the Prisoner's
second
visit to Mr W in 1992, the Prisoner had asked Mr W if he would adopt him.  She
also records that after the period with Mr
W, Tomi settled into Minali and
staff reported that he was generally co-operative and pleasant though reserved.
He showed little
affect until a letter from his natural mother around 24 July
when he became very upset and angry asking "what right has she to get
to walk
back into my life after ignoring me for years?".  He was still very angry on 26
July 1994 when he damaged property of the
St Vincent de Paul Society, tried to
set fire to some toilets and damaged two cars.  Other observations made in the
report were:-
<P>

"As with his previous testing Tomi related easily to the examiner on a very
superficial level.  However it was difficult to establish
any real rapport with
Tomi as his general affect is flat and passive.
<P>

"Tomi had very good attentional skills and his approach to tasks is considered
and methodical.  He requires no encouragement to
continue when items become
difficult as he is self motivated to persist.
<P>

".... Tomi retains his fantasy of a perfect family life and still wishes to be
part of that family with both a mother and a father.
 But as has been seen from
his last foster placement, Tomi cannot handle the closeness associated with
family life. ...
<P>

"Despite Mr W's personal efforts to provide Tomi with a safe, warm home life
without emotional strings attached, by definition the
expectation was there
that Tomi would respond appropriately.  Tomi realised he wasn't able to respond
even though he hasn't acknowledged
this fact and thus wanted the pressure
removed by leaving the placement
<P>

"... (Tomi) has made considerable personal gains over the past couple of years
but he is still immature.  He continues to have that
"empty quality" about him
that years of neglect and abuse have effected.  This cannot be "made right" by
emotional input from others
as Tomi is unable to respect or respond
appropriately.
<P>

"As much as Tomi wants to be placed with other foster parents, this would not
be in his best interests, as the anxious, needy behaviours
which can display
(sic) would surface as soon as he was placed under any emotional stress."
<P>

80   	On 29 August 1994, one may infer in consequence of one of
the malicious damage incidents to which I have referred, the Prisoner
was
placed on probation for 9 months on condition he be of good behaviour.  On 14
September he was again formally made a ward.  His
behaviour over the next 9
months or so seems to have deteriorated significantly.  There are reports of
him absconding, becoming intoxicated
on drink and drugs, inhaling lighter
fluid, self-mutilating and stealing cars or from them.  He was picked up by
Flemington Police
at the home of a paedophile.  He made contact with two other
adults who indicated some interest in adopting or caring for him.  One
of these
also seems to have been a paedophile.  A report of 23 June 1995 records that
the Prisoner said that he would like to live
with his sister and his second
choice was to live on the streets.  One of 16 July 1995 records a chance
meeting between a youth worker
and the Prisoner who said he was stealing car
radios and swapping them for marijuana.
<P>

81   	In late August 1995, the Prisoner arrived at Mr W's home
and asked for another chance to live with him and go to school. 
Mr W indicated
that he was happy to give the Prisoner a second chance if he was sincere.  The
department approved.  A detailed school
report of 11 October 1995 records 50
out of the 56 classifications given as satisfactory or good or excellent.
However by that time
there were again indications that the placement was
breaking down.  The Prisoner had said that he only returned to Mr W so he would
not get locked up and felt Mr W's place restrictive and did not wish to stay.
Somewhat inconsistently, according to notes of 26 October
1995, the Prisoner
was sleeping in Mr W's bed again despite efforts by Mr W to get him back to his
own bed.  (Professor Hayes, called
during the proceedings on sentence, clearly
had serious reservations as to the adequacy of Mr W's responses to the
Prisoner.) 
<P>

82   	A file note of 22 November 1995 records that the Prisoner
had been lodging of late with the deceased.  The Prisoner was advised
that the
Marrickville Community Services Centre would facilitate the Prisoner's
placement with the deceased after the Prisoner's
16th birthday if that remained
his wish.  A later note of 17 January 1996 records that "it was pointed out to
Tomi the last time
he was on the run and spent time with Geoff, this person who
allegedly is responsible, failed to notify the Department, allowed Tomi
to roam
the streets day and night".
<P>

83   	On 22 November 1995 the Prisoner returned to Mr W's and
seems to have continued there until Anzac day in 1996.  He visited
the deceased
in Sydney, failed to return and disappeared until 8 June when he called Mr W
asking if he could return.  On 11 June
he arrived saying he was back to stay.
However by 24 June Mr W demanded that he leave and arrangements were made for
the Prisoner
to stay at the department's Bowral refuge pending completion of
inquires into Mr Boyson's fitness.
<P>

84   	In early August 1996 the Prisoner collapsed and was taken
to hospital with alcohol intoxication.  On 22 August he absconded
and went to
Mr Boyson's unit.  He said he intended to stay there.  On 1 October 1996 the
Prisoner and the deceased collected the
Prisoner's belongings from Bowral.
<P>

85   	The above summary of information contained in the
departmental files is by no means comprehensive.  There are, for example,
reports which show the Prisoner at times having tried hard with school work,
possessing good verbal and social skills, could be clear
and assertive and had
performed reasonably well.  There were notes that his positive points were the
enjoyment of gross motor skills
and challenges, liked to be doing things and
enjoyed positive reinforcement and praise.  At times his behaviour was
excellent.  Other
records show that he had been disruptive far more often than
I have indicated.  At times he was noted as aggressive although there
does not
seem to be any record of significant violence beyond that to which I have
referred.  He displayed an unusual attitude of
not caring for toys or clothes.
However the summary I have given is enough for present purposes.
<P>

86   	Additional material is to be found in the reports of Drs
Wong and Canaris.  It is sufficient if I quote parts of Dr Wong's
assessment-
<P>

"He has marked emotional coldness, lack of empathy and shallow affect.  This is
an observation which has been referred to, in one
way or another, by almost all
the professionals who interviewed him.  ... At no time was I able to detect any
of the warmth and empathy
that I would normally expect in interactions with a
fellow human being.  I consider this abnormal, even after making due allowance
for the fact that he is amidst his trial for murder...
<P>

Probably as a result of his emotional callousness he had a lot of difficulties
whenever emotional demands of any kind were put on
him.  This is another
recurrent theme that emerges on reading the various reports on him...
<P>

In summary, Tomi has gross emotional coldness, shallow affect and lack of
empathy, a persistent failure to conform to social norms,
a reckless disregard
for the safety of others and lack of remorse.  Taken together, this is
indicative of gross psychiatric disturbance.
...
<P>

Tomi had suffered gross neglect, both emotional and physical, in the first year
of his life ... While emotional deprivation and/or
sexual abuse may certainly
predispose to the development of personality disorders or other psychiatric
abnormalities in later years,
this is not invariable and a person might emerge
relatively unscathed.  I therefore base my diagnosis on the abnormalities he
manifested
around the time of the alleged offence, rather than on the presence
of events which may predispose to the development of such abnormalities."
<P>

<b>REMORSE</b>
<P>

87   	I am satisfied that the Prisoner has experienced genuine
and significant remorse for what he has done.  The timing and terms
of his
second 000 phone call, combined with the fact that he then turned up at the
block in which the deceased's unit was situate
some 5 minutes later seem to me
to argue compellingly in this direction.  His early statement to police
officers that he had stabbed
the deceased argues in the same direction.
<P>

88   	In arriving at the conclusion I have, I am not unmindful
that the Prisoner left a message on the deceased's answering machine
which was
clearly directed to providing evidence of an alibi and told a similar story of
having been on a camping trip when first
questioned.  I accept also that at
least in part, the idea of turning himself in was put in the Prisoner's mind by
Mr Stone and that
the Prisoner is reported to have said on at least one
occasion that to return to Mr Boyson's unit he must have forgotten Mr Boysen's
death.  Although it is consistent with what Ms Jones wrote in her Department of
Juvenile Justice report, I acknowledge that my conclusion
is inconsistent with
the view of Dr Wong at, for example page 445 of the transcript.
<P>

89   	And I do not suggest that the Prisoner's remorse is, or
has always been unqualified.  He has expressed a view to the effect
that he
eliminated a "faggot" and may well regard or have regarded the deceased as in
part the author of his own misfortune.  Evidence
of those who have discussed
with the Prisoner the events of 24 October 1996 suggest that he may not yet
have mentally faced up to
the full circumstances of what occurred.  However the
actions of the Prisoner to which I have referred in paragraph 86 speak
loudly.
<P>

<b>MISCONDUCT SUBSEQUENT TO ARREST</b>
<P>

90   	After his arrest on 26 October 1996, the Prisoner seems to
have been in custody till granted bail by Bruce J on 18 November
1996.
Conditions of the bail were that the Prisoner was to reside at Mark David Farm
at Sutton Forest, not leave the farm except
in the company of an employee of
that institution, not use illegal drugs or alcohol and report to police.
<P>

91   	On 18 August 1997, the Prisoner threw a piece of fencing
wire onto power lines to arc them out.  One wire broke, starting
a fire.  The
Prisoner absconded but was found 1km up the road.
<P>

92   	In July and again on 25 August, the Prisoner's natural
father visited him.  The visits are recorded as having gone well and
that on
the second occasion his father quietly chastised the Prisoner for starting the
fire.  On 29 September his father, step-mother
and 2 step siblings visited
again as arranged.  The Prisoner disappeared when he saw the car coming and did
not return until after
the family had left.
<P>

93   	In October 1997, the Prisoner went to a fuel bowser,
emptied fuel onto the ground and lit it.  It would seem that because
the bowser
was locked, he was able to obtain only a small quantity.  His co-ordinator is
recorded as believing the Prisoner engaged
in these actions because he was
being moved to another unit for a 2 week drug &amp; alcohol program.
<P>

94   	Reports in January 1998 were generally favourable.  One
recorded that the Prisoner's "at risk" behaviour such as fire lighting
seems to
have abated.
<P>

95   	Putting aside the matters I have mentioned some of which
may fall into this category, there have been two occasions when the
Prisoner
has breached his bail conditions.  One involved a failure to report on one
occasion but there is nothing to suggest that
this incident is presently
significant.  The other was when he was allowed by a youth worker associated
with Mark David Farm to be
unsupervised within ready distance of a liquor
outlet.  The Prisoner purchased alcohol and drank a significant quantity.
There is
some evidence that there was another breach also involving alcohol
although, in light of Father Rileys' evidence, I remain unpersuaded
of 3
breaches.
<P>

96   	The incident mentioned was reported and the Prisoner
arrested and detained at Kariong for some little time.  On 20 May 1998
bail was
again granted by this Court.  Apart from the fact that the institution involved
was to be the John Miller Farm, the conditions
were, so far as is presently
relevant, the same as had been imposed by Bruce J. 
<P>

<b>ANTECEDENTS</b>
<P>

97   	According to the report from the Department of Juvenile
Justice put before me, the Prisoner had the following history of offending:-

<P>

98   	The only conviction recorded in the report of the
Prisoner's antecedents which was tendered is one which occurred on 27 June
1997
for an offence of breaking entering and stealing on 14 October 1996.  The
Prisoner was placed on 12 months probation.  I infer
that this is the fourth of
the offences referred to in the Juvenile Justice report.  The effect of s15 of
the Children (Criminal
Proceedings) Act is that I should not take this offence
or any of the other convictions to which I have referred into account.  Given
firstly the difference in nature of the offence for which the Prisoner now
stands for sentence and these other matters and secondly,
the general history
and circumstances of the Prisoner otherwise, including his history since
October 1996, I would not in any event
have regarded these convictions as
having any impact of present significance.
<P>

<b>OTHER MATTERS</b>
<P>

99   	During the course of proceedings on sentence a report as
required by s25 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act was tendered
and
evidence given by one of its authors, Ms Jones.  Later, the co-author, Ms
Duncan gave evidence.  In the report, it was said that
the Prisoner's attitude
and beliefs were not characteristic of an individual who possessed anti-social
beliefs to a significant degree,
that he demonstrated a level of insight into
his offending behaviour and was responsive to treatment and intervention; he
appeared
to have a high degree of impulse control in relation to anger and
stress.  Nevertheless, it was suggested that, if the Prisoner were
not sent
into custody he participate in a Violent Offenders' Program, one Ms Jones
described as a program for serious and repeat
offenders.  Although I do not
need to, and in consequence, do not rely on the fact, the authors of the report
suggested that the
Court consider imposing a community based order.
<P>

100   	On behalf of the Prisoner evidence was called from
Professor Hayes, the head of the Department of Behavioural Sciences in
Medicine
at the University of Sydney, and from persons associated with Youth off the
Streets Inc, the organisation which conducts
the homes at which the Prisoner
has been residing since his arrest.  Though there were some minor differences,
I accept generally
what these witnesses have said.
<P>

101   	Professor Hayes observed that the Prisoner's presentation
was in marked contrast to how his appearance as recorded by Drs
Canaris and
Wong and that he smiled and laughed and made eye contact appropriately through
his interview with her and appeared enthusiastic
when he spoke of his present
and future life.  Professor Hayes also said that the Prisoner's profile on a
Personality Assessment
Inventory test indicated that he was not suffering from
any psychiatric symptoms, albeit she added that there were grounds for thinking
that the Prisoner was dealing with past traumas by a process of denial.
<P>

102   	Some of these matters made me wonder whether the Prisoner
had been putting on an act for the benefit of Drs Wong and Canaris
and indeed
during the course of the trial when the Prisoner had sat for almost all of its
12 or so days with head bowed looking at
the floor and exhibited little, if
any, emotion.  The view that the Prisoner was not suffering from any
psychiatric symptoms also
provides ground for wondering about the accuracy of
the opinion of the doctors that at the time of Mr Boyson's death, the Prisoner
was suffering from an abnormality of mind.
<P>

103   	Although it was tendered after counsel had made their
submissions on the issue of diminished responsibility, Professor Hayes'
report
and her evidence are matters I have taken into account on that issue.  However
at the end of the day I reached the conclusion
expressed above.  The Prisoner's
affect of which Drs Canaris and Wong spoke was noted sufficiently often in the
past by authors of
documents in the DOCS file that I do infer it was genuine
and one must recognise that there have been changes in the Prisoner's
circumstances
over time.  Professor Hayes observed that from what the Prisoner
had said, his time with Youth off the Streets has been the most
stable and
happy environment that he has ever been in throughout his entire life and he is
learning to trust people.  Other evidence,
some of which I refer to below,
shows that he has participated in programs calculated to overcome a number of
his problems and that
there have been significant changes in him since he was
taken in by that organisation.  One must recognise that of the 2&#190; years
the Prisoner has been with YOTS prior to his interview with Professor Hayes,
2&#189; years occurred prior to his interviews with
Drs Canaris and Wong
although neither must one forget that, although he still faced the prospect of
going to jail at the time of
seeing Professor Hayes, he had by then been
acquitted of murder.
<P>

104   	Furthermore, in the period between seeing the doctors and
Professor Hayes, the Prisoner had also been interviewed on 5 occasions
for a
total of some 9 hours by Ms Jones, who noted that the Prisoner had become
noticeably more relaxed and talkative and made more
eye contact as time
progressed, and had been intensively counselled by a Dr Brentrow for periods
totalling some 23&#189; hours over
some 4 or 5 days.  One hesitates to conclude
that after a lifetime of experiences such as the Prisoner had had, counselling
over
but a few days could make much difference but in this case the evidence of
Father Riley suggests it did. 
<P>

105   	Although the topic is of more significance later, it may
be appropriate to divert and say something about YOTS and Father
Riley.  YOTS
operates a number of residential premises ranging from highly structured
environments to independent houses.  These
residential premises include farms
such as those where the Prisoner resided pending trial.  It has about 110 beds
for residential
placements.  The farms incorporate or have access to a school
run by the organisation and which is accredited and educates persons
within the
organisation's care up to the Higher School Certificate standard.  
<P>

106   	YOTS also operates on the streets of, and has crisis
centres in, inner Sydney.  It operates drug and alcohol programmes.
 In Father
Riley's words, given in the course of an application for bail, but to which the
parties agreed I could have regard :-
<P>

Its "profile would be we would take kids who no one else will be involved with,
who are basically on the streets, or kids who are
in custody for welfare
issues, or kids in custody who have no other options for them, so, in terms of
maybe eligible for bail but
there is no one there to take them out.  So we are
involved with the chronically homeless or hard core street kids."
<P>

107   	At least in part it tries to model itself on a family,
and its approach is "getting close to kids".  Though it has a cut-off
(entrance) age of 18, the organisation only moves people out when they are
ready or breach some of the rules, e.g. fail a urinalysis.
 It remains involved
with, at least some, persons who have left its programmes or who are in
independent living.
<P>

108   	Father Riley is the Director and Chief Executive Officer
of YOTS.  He is a qualified teacher, is a Bachelor of Theology and
Bachelor of
Arts majoring in sociology, and has Diplomas in Psychology, Abuse Counselling,
Residential Care and Teaching.  He said
that he has not previously been
involved in the supervision of persons subject to recognisances but it is clear
that he has been
involved with persons on bail.  He said, and I accept, that it
is his invariable rule to report persons released into his care who
breach
their bail conditions and I have no doubt that Father Riley would, as he said,
report the Prisoner if the latter breached
the terms of any recognisance to
which he was subject.
<P>

109   	Among the programmes employed by YOTS is one referred to
as Positive Peer Culture, a programme designed to induce young people
to
address and help each other with issues that concern them and to identify
strengths they have and can use in that regard.  A leading
proponent and
perhaps developer of this program is Dr Brentrow who comes from the United
States.  He has been an adviser to YOTS
for some 2 years and during the period
the Prisoner was on bail awaiting sentence was in Australia giving in-service
training to
YOTS staff.  Father Riley induced Dr Brentrow to consult with the
Prisoner.
<P>

110   	During an application for bail on 8 June 1999 following
the Prisoner's conviction, Father Riley said that the Prisoner had
significant
problems in the Positive Peer Culture program and that, while there has been
some improvement, he still had difficulty
in articulating his emotions.  It was
subsequent to this that the counselling with Dr Brentrow occurred. According to
Father Riley's
evidence on 13 August, during the last consultation "we were
dealing with a very different type of person that was portrayed in (the)
court
room" and that the Prisoner had changed dramatically.  Father Riley did not
suggest, and nor do I, that all of the Prisoner's
emotional or behavioural or
lifestyle problems were behind him.  As did others, Father Riley said that the
Prisoner still needed
a supported and structured environment.  However the
matters to which I have referred are enough to persuade me that Dr Hayes'
assessment
of the Prisoner does not invalidate what Drs Wong and Canaris had
said bearing on the topic of diminished responsibility at the time
of Mr
Boyson's death.  It may be noted that Professor Hayes was of the view that the
Prisoner had not been "putting it on" for Drs
Canaris and Wong.
<P>

111   	Other matters relevant to the sentence to be imposed
include the following.  The Prisoner has been assessed as of average
intellectual ability although Mr Sims, one of his teachers, describes the
Prisoner as above average.  Since he has been at YOTS he
has applied himself to
study and achieved his school certificate.  He is studying for his Higher
School Certificate this year.  His
school reports consistently describe his
behaviour as very good and his class activity as good or very good.  He
commenced an entry
course at Wollongong University in 1998 although he withdrew
due to the workload and his perception that there were too many drugs
readily
available there.  The Prisoner has identified careers in which he is
interested.
<P>

112   	The Prisoner has participated in drug and alcohol
counselling.  Father Riley said that the Prisoner had not reacted angrily
or
violently while at YOTS although Mr Sims refers to one incident of what he
described as legitimate anger.  Father Riley said that
the Prisoner had
developed greatly over the 2&#189; years with YOTS and while he had
particularly major issues to deal with emotionally,
there was significant hope
for rehabilitation and indeed the Prisoner had come a long way already in that
respect.  Father Riley
said:-
<P>

"We have had other kids with very serious charges in our programs who have not
held together nearly as effectively as Tomi has and
that, from my point of
view, is a real credit; that he is able to deal with the incredible stress and
pressure that he has had to
deal with in such a mature way.  I know it has been
hard for him."
<P>

113   	Father Riley gave some further evidence on this topic at
T89 on 13 August 1999 which it is unnecessary to repeat but which
I found
impressive, as indeed I found him.
<P>

114   	Professor Hayes opined:-
<P>

"He continues to be, I think, a very traumatised young man and I think that he
is probably denying, to some extent, his own distress
and problems, but I'm not
sure that they can be addressed at the moment until there has been a settling
and trust-creating process,
and I don't think, also, that those disturbances
would necessarily result in violent behaviour in the future."
<P>

115   	Professor Hayes also said that all the factors which
would predict violence in the future are in favour of the likelihood
that there
will be no violent incidents in the future.
<P>

116   	Another factor which argues against a custodial sentence
is the evidence which has been given as to the undesirable features
of
detention centres.
<P>

117   	Professor Hayes gave evidence that the environment of the
Juvenile Justice Detention Centres of Kariong and Minda was violent
in the
sense that in-mates tended to prey on one another, that at Kariong (and I would
infer at other detention centres also) there
was a "tough environment pecking
order, where the crime and what has been committed is often the topic of
conversation."  She said
drugs were available in both institutions and the
opportunity to engage in therapeutic programs is much more limited than in the
environment where the Prisoner has been pending trial. 
<P>

118   	On the occasion when the Prisoner sought bail pending the
sentencing hearing, I asked Father Riley whether he saw any likelihood
of
damage if between then and sentence the Prisoner was kept in a detention
centre.  Father Riley answered firmly in the affirmative.
 Inter alia he
said:-
<P>

"I do get kids out of these detention centres time and time again, fixing up
what happens to them in those facilities is major and
the ones that have been
institutionalised - and I can think of two in the last week - for periods of
even 18 months in a juvenile
detention centre - the damage that has happened to
them and the hardness - I wonder, with these two I have got last week, whether
I still have hope with them.  They are 17.  They are so institutionalised I do
not know if we can break through that.
<P>

Tomi is not institutionalised at this point, I don't believe."  
<P>

<b>THE PRINCIPLES</b>
<P>

119   	The approach and the considerations which a Court must
take into account in a case such as this are well know.  The appropriate
starting point is the recognition that the offence has involved the felonious
taking of a human life - <b>R v Blacklidge</b> (unreported, CCA, 12 December
1995) - a matter of the utmost seriousness.  The subjective features of an
offender must not be allowed
undue weight - <b>R v Geddes</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20554" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) SR (NSW)
554</a> at 556.  In that regard I should acknowledge that I am conscious that, in
these Reasons, attention to those subjective circumstances
has occupied far
more space than the objective circumstances of the offence.  That is largely a
reflection of the fact that the circumstances
of the offence are essentially
simple while the subjective circumstances cover the full period of the
Prisoner's life.  It is not
an indication of an inadequate recognition of what
happened to Mr Boyson.
<P>

120   	On the other hand, the circumstances of both offences of
manslaughter and offenders convicted of that charge vary enormously,
and this
Court has recognised that not in all cases is a custodial sentence required.
Examples of cases of manslaughter where custodial
sentences have not been
imposed include <b>R v Thiel </b>(unreported, Finlay J, 27 September 1990),
R<b> v Gardner </b>(unreported, Wood J, 27 March 1992, <b>R v Gilham</b>
(unreported, Abadee J, 7 April 1995), <b>R v Platts </b>(unreported, Newman J,
7 June 1996), and <b>R v Kennedy </b>(unreported, Greg James J, 30 June 1998).
Nevertheless, it must be recognised that the circumstances of those cases might
fairly be
described as exceptional or extreme.
<P>

121   	In my view, the same may be said of the circumstances of
this case.  In that regard, I do not find it necessary to rely on
the factors
of diminished responsibility and provocation, although I do regard both of
those factors as arguing with significant
weight for a sentence towards the
lower end of the range.  The provocation, as I have said, was very high and a
case where the offender
was suffering from an abnormality of mind is not one
where the element of deterrence has the same weight as in other circumstances
-
<b>R v Scognamiglio</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2056%20A%20Crim%20R%2081" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 56 A Crim R 81</a> at 85-6, <b>R v Bus and AS</b>
(unreported, CCA, 3 November 1995).
<P>

122   	Furthermore allowance must be made for the offender's
youth. <b>R v GDP</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2053%20A%20Crim%20R%20112" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 53 A Crim R 112</a> and the prospects of
rehabilitation which, for reasons indicated below, are attendant upon a
non-custodial sentence.  The circumstances
of the offence in this case are not
ones where the considerations of youth may or should, be or be almost,
disregarded - c.f. <b>R v Gordon</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2071%20A%20Crim%20R%20459" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 71 A Crim R 459</a> at 469, <b>R v
MacIntyre </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2038%20A%20Crim%20R%20130" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 38 A Crim R 130</a> at 139.  However, in light of the matters
to which I am about to refer, I do not need to consider whether, in their
absence, a custodial
sentence would have been required.
<P>

123   	What makes this case one which may fairly be described as
exceptional or extreme is the Prisoner's upbringing.  It may be
summarised as
follows.
<P>

124   	Developmentally delayed in his first year of life due to
the lack of care by his alcoholic mother he was removed from her.
 Exhibiting
"gross behavioural, emotional, educational and cognitive problems" by the time
he was nearly 6 - caused or contributed
to by inadequacies in the persons with
whom he was fostered - he was removed from them.  After 2 years in Bernardos
and in another
foster care, both of which placements seem to have progressed
well in the circumstances - he and his sister were again moved - back
to his
mother.  Although by then she had apparently overcome her alcoholism, given
that history and the "very difficult management
problems" which the Prisoner
and his sister were, not surprisingly his mother could not cope and in December
1990 he was once again
removed.
<P>

125   	Nearly 11, and diagnosed as unable to trust adults,
viewing the world as a rather threatening place and lacking the personal
resources to deal with emotional pressures, there cannot have been much, if
any, time since he was born that he had the benefit of
love, self esteem, or
self-confidence.  Institutionalised during 1991 he was rejected again by his
mother at Christmas time of that
year.  His subsequent placement with Mr W may
have been of a steadying nature, but a consideration of what happened after
December
1991 leads to the conclusion that the die was cast.  Certainly, the
Prisoner's history reminds one of the maxim, attributed to the
Jesuits, to the
effect, "Give me a child till the age of seven, and I will give you the
man".
<P>

126   	Although the Prisoner's past does not entitle him to
ignore or disobey the laws essential to the operation of a civilised
society,
his upbringing was so different from the norm that it seems to me it would be
wrong simply to judge his actions by the standards
one would apply to a person
who had enjoyed a normal, loving and reasonably emotionally stable upbringing.
In my view the circumstances
of the case are such that, notwithstanding the
Prisoner's offence was manslaughter, (and alcohol a possibly drugs were
involved)
a custodial sentence should not be imposed.
<P>

127   	In reaching this conclusion I have not ignored the
possibility that the Prisoner's past may render him more likely than others
to
again indulge in anti-social and criminal behaviour.  However, on this topic,
the Prisoner has the advantage of the good reports
as to his behaviour while he
has been with YOTS and the favourable opinion of Professor Hayes which I
accept.  Furthermore, the course
I propose to adopt is calculated to provide
the Prisoner with continued guidance and instruction for some time to come.  It
is also
unlikely that the strain which the Prisoner must have experienced in
awaiting for some 2&#189; years his trial for murder will not
have had a
salutary effect on him.
<P>

128   	I have not found it necessary to take into account the
conditions described as operating at the detention centres to which
I have
referred, beyond recognising that such centres could not provide the
environment for rehabilitation which I am satisfied exists
with Youth of the
Streets.  At the same time I cannot but record my dismay that, despite the
clear advantage to the community of
rehabilitation of young offenders, the
Courts of this State are required to send such persons to institutions which
the evidence
in this case (and in other cases I have heard) shows, are likely
to make such young offenders worse.  That such institutions cannot
be kept drug
free or virtually so, is a damning indictment of those responsible for their
administration.
<P>

129   	Having, on 13 August 1999, arrived at the conclusion that
I should not impose a custodial sentence, I sought further assistance
from the
Crown, the Department of Juvenile Justice and Father Riley as to the course
which should be followed.  While not resiling
from his primary submission that
a custodial sentence was required, the learned Crown Prosecutor did not contend
that a properly
structured recognisance under Section 558 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> was
not the next most appropriate course.  He did, however, submit that the
conditions of any such recognisance should refer to and
involve the Prisoner's
supervision by the Department of Juvenile Justice rather than, as I had
suggested, Father Riley.
<P>

130   	In that regard he pointed out that the Department was
constituted by Parliament for the very purpose and represented a permanent
institution with officers dedicated to, and likely to be experienced in, the
tasks.  He pointed out that by contrast YOTS was but
a voluntary organisation
and Father Riley had not undertaken such a role before.
<P>

131   	Although I do not judge the Department of Juvenile
Justice or its present or future staff by the Department of Community
Services
or those officers within it who have had responsibility prior to this for the
Prisoner, the performance by the Department
of Community Services in looking
after the Prisoner's interests is sufficient to greatly weaken, if not remove,
any presumption that
a Department of State is better than a voluntary
organisation.  Although it is not my primary function to sit in judgment upon
the
Department of Community Services, it is I think not inappropriate to record
that that Department's performance so far as the Prisoner
is concerned seems to
me to have been appalling.  Having taken control of the Prisoner, for 5 years
after he was first made a ward
the Department failed to ensure that he and his
sister were being properly looked after and not emotionally abused.  Then, to
return
the Prisoner and his sister to his natural mother, when she presumably
still had the emotional or physiological inadequacies which
had led her to
becoming an alcoholic in the first place, at a time when the children were
still regarded as "very difficult management
problems who require intensive and
continuous care which is far beyond that required for a ward in normal
circumstances" is impossible
to understand given the risks which yet a further
rejection would involve.  Despite some 16 assessments of the Prisoner by
psychologists
and psychiatrists between 1982 and 1996 and a file of paper some
13 cm thick, the Department never overcame the problems to which
they had
contributed.  Although the circumstances have been different it is appropriate
to observe that Father Riley and his organisation
has achieved more in 2&#189;
years than the Department did in 15.
<P>

132   	Furthermore, although the Department of Juvenile Justice
may be permanent, its employees are not.  Amanda Jones, the officer
who
interviewed the Prisoner for the purposes of the sentencing proceedings had
left the Department before those proceedings were
concluded.  She had been with
the Department but 2&#189; years and her co-signatory, Ms Duncan, 5&#189;
years.  Both were young and
although the likelihood is that some other person
would supervise the Prisoner if the Department was the supervising body, these
facts demonstrate that such a person may not have anywhere near the experience
and expertise one may infer Father Riley has.  And
there is some evidence to
suggest that the Department has, by no means, adequate resources.  Although Ms
Duncan said that there was
a Juvenile Justice officer in Bowral who could
travel quite regularly to monitor the Prisoner's progress, Father Riley's
evidence,
which I accept, was that when the Prisoner was required to be
interviewed for the purposes of placing the Juvenile Justice report
before me,
the Department's resources were not such as enable its officer even to travel
to the Prisoner.  YOTS had to transport
the Prisoner 4 times to the Department.
Of some relevance also is that, according to Amanda Jones' report, the Prisoner
did not respond
well to supervision by the Department of Juvenile Justice in
1995 and, although the period of his absence is unknown to me, the Department
did not know of his whereabouts.
<P>

133   	In any event, I am satisfied that the supervision of the
Prisoner by Father Riley or other officers of his organisation is
likely to be
at least as thorough, and for some years substantially more constant, than
supervision by the Department.  I am also
satisfied that the rehabilitation
available to the Prisoner at or through YOTS is at least the equal of that
which the Department
can provide.  I do not regard participation in a specific
Violent Offender's Program as required.  Given what YOTS has achieved it,
or
more specifically Father Riley, should continue to supervise the Prisoner.
<P>

134   	The Crown prosecutor also submitted that any recognisance
should be for a period of 5 years.  In light of the fact that the
Prisoner has
already been subject to significant restrictions on his liberty for over
2&#189; years now, I do not regard so long
a period as required.  I propose to
limit the period of the recognisance to 4 years.  The other provisions of the
recognisance were
not the subject of contention.  As imposed on 15 September
1999, it was in the following terms:-
<P>

"(K) for the offence of manslaughter, of which you have been convicted, I defer
passing sentence and order your release upon your
entering into a recognisance,
without surety, in the amount of $500, for a period of four years, such
recognisance to include the
following conditions:-
<P>

1.  that you be of good behaviour;
<P>

2.  that you not partake of illegal drugs;
<P>

3.  that you not partake of alcohol for a period of twelve months.
<P>

4.  that you reside only at such places as may be approved of by Father Riley
or other the Director for the time being of Youth
Off the Streets Inc;
<P>

5.  that you participate in such educational, vocational, drug and alcohol, and
other programs as may be directed by Father Riley
or other the Director for the
time being of Youth Off the Streets Inc;
<P>

6.  that you undertake such employment and only such employment as may be
approved of by Father Riley or other the dire tor for
the time being of Youth
Off the Streets Inc;
<P>

7.  that you obey all reasonable directions of Father Riley or other the
Director for the time being of Youth Off the Streets Inc,
including directions
concerning the ingestion of alcohol at the expiration of the twelve months
referred to in condition 3."
<P>
