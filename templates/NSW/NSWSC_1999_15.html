<P>

EQUITY DIVISION

<P>

4 FEBRUARY 1999
<P>

<b>2881 / 98</b>
<P>

PARTIES:		<b>CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF STAMP DUTIES</b>
<P>

Plaintiff
<P>

			<b>PALIFLEX PTY LTD</b>
<P>

Defendant
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	By a summons filed on 19 June 1998 the plaintiff seeks orders for winding up
the defendant, relying on a statutory demand served
under s.459E of the
Corporations Law.  The defendant contests the application.
<P>

2	The Corporations Law requires that unless the leave of the Court is obtained,
a person may not oppose an application to wind a
company up in insolvency
unless a notice of grounds is filed and served within the period prescribed by
the Rules:  s.465C;  Supreme
Court Rules Part 80A rule 17.  The defendant did
not comply with this requirement prior to the hearing, but at the beginning of
the
hearing it applied for leave to oppose the application for winding up on
the following grounds:
<P>

	(a)  the statutory demand dated 7 May 1998 was not properly served;
<P>

	(b)  the plaintiff is not a creditor of the defendant;
<P>

	(c)  the defendant is solvent and, accordingly, leave should be granted under
s.459S of the Corporations Law.
<P>

	Since it was clear from earlier mentions of this matter before me that the
plaintiff had ample notice of the defendant's intention
to oppose the
application, and the grounds of opposition, I granted leave as sought.  
<P>

3	When the matter first came before me for mention in September 1998 it was
contemplated that it may be necessary to formulate and
settle questions for
determination.  The reason was that the defendant's contentions about whether
the debt is owing may raise a
matter arising under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> or
involving its interpretation, which cannot be determined by the Court unless
notices are given to the Attorneys-General of the
Commonwealth and the States
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s78b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.78B</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act 1903</a> (Cth).  In an effort to contain the
litigation the parties had not given the requisite notices, and wished to have
the Court determine
as separate questions those aspects of the case which would
not raise constitutional issues.  Pursuant to directions which I gave
in
September, the parties filed separate questions for determination, but at the
hearing it did not seem to be necessary to proceed
in that fashion, and no
order for the determination of separate questions under Supreme Court Rules Pt
31 was made.  The judgment
which I shall now deliver will, in effect, cover the
issues which were put forward as separate questions for determination under
Pt
31.  
<P>

4	My decision is that the statutory demand and supporting affidavit have been
properly served on the defendant, and that the defendant
should be granted
leave under s.459S of the Corporations Law to oppose the plaintiff's winding up
application on the ground that
the debt claimed by the plaintiff is not due and
payable.  My resolution of the issues in this way means that the question
whether
the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff must be considered and
resolved as part of the next step in the litigation, the other
part being
whether the defendant can prove that it is solvent in an over-all sense.  The
question of indebtedness gives rise to a
constitutional issue and so it will be
necessary for s.78B notices to be given before that issue is heard and
determined.  I shall
return to these matters later in my reasons for
judgment.
<P>

	<b>Facts</b>
<P>

5	Prior to 31 January 1998 Mr Barry Anstee, the sole director of the defendant,
lived at 61 Mulga Road, Oatley.  Mr Anstee's daughter
lived with Rory McCann at
59 Mulga Road.  Those two properties are in a row of four houses owned by
Balbabe Pty Ltd, a company related
to Mr Anstee.  From about March 1997 to 4
February 1998, the basement garage at 59 Mulga Road was used as an office for
several of
Mr Anstee's companies including the defendant.  On 5 September 1997
a notification of change of address (Form 203) was lodged for
the defendant
with the Australian Securities Commission, recording that the registered office
of the defendant was changed on 2 September
1997 to 59 Mulga Road, Oatley.
<P>

6	By a contract dated 5 September 1997 the defendant purchased the property at
97 Elizabeth Bay Road, Elizabeth Bay from the Commonwealth
of Australia for $9
million.  Mr Anstee attended at the Office of State Revenue in Parramatta on 5
November 1997 and lodged the contract
with a `Non-Urgent Application for
Impressed Stamping'.  His evidence is that he had a conversation with an
officer of the plaintiff
in which he said that the contract was lodged for
stamping on the basis that it was not dutiable.  He says that the Office of
State
Revenue took the document and provided a receipt which recorded a nil
amount.  The defendant then required that the transfer in its
favour be
stamped, believing that the duty would be $2.00.  However, by a letter dated 21
November 1997 the plaintiff informed the
defendant that stamp duty had been
assessed at $480,490.  Additionally, a fine of $96,098 had been imposed, and
the fine would increase
to $120,122.50 if not paid by 5 December 1997, and
$480,490 if not paid by 5 January 1998.
<P>

7	The defendant arranged with the plaintiff that the stamped transfer would be
released if it provided an undertaking in an appropriate
form.  The defendant
accordingly wrote to the plaintiff on 26 November 1997, enclosing an
undertaking under seal whereby the defendant
undertook to pay the `assessed
duty and any additional interest' in respect of the contract.  The covering
letter recorded the defendant's
understanding that the duty payable was
$480,494 and explained that the money to pay stamp duty formed part of the
funding arrangements
for the purchase.  The letter requested that an interest
charge for late payment be imposed, rather than a fine.  
<P>

8	Mr Anstee had several telephone conversations with Mr Cunneen of the Office
of State Revenue in the early part of 1998.  There
is conflicting evidence as
to precisely what was said, but the flavour of the conversations was that Mr
Anstee was seeking to negotiate
an interest payment rather than a fine, and was
endeavouring to assemble funds for payment.  
<P>

9	On 31 January 1998 Mr Anstee, his wife and daughter moved from Oatley to 97
Elizabeth Bay Road, Elizabeth Bay.  The relationship
between Mr Anstee's
daughter and Rory McCann had come to an end, but Mr McCann remained in
occupation at 59 Mulga Road as a tenant.
 It appears that there were some other
occupants with Mr McCann.  He remained in occupation until 12 June 1998. 
<P>

10	Mr Anstee says that on 4 February 1998 he returned to Oatley and prepared
notices of change of registered office for a number
of his companies including
the defendant.  He says he posted the notices to the Australian Securities
Commission from Oatley.  The
plaintiff tendered extracts from the Commission's
records taken on 19 June 1998, 8 September 1998 and 9 December 1998, which all
showed 59 Mulga Road, Oatley as the address of the current registered office of
the defendant.  I do not accept Mr Anstee's evidence
that he posted the notices
of change of registered office.  He gave evidence that he had left it in the
hands of his accountant to
attend to corporate records but his evidence also
suggests that some of the corporate records for his companies are in disarray.
It would be puzzling that, if the notices had been posted, no action appears to
have been taken by him or on his behalf to follow
up the alleged lodgment, to
ensure that the Commission's records had properly been adjusted.  In any event,
it is clear from the
extracts from the Commission's records which are in
evidence that no change of registered office has been recorded for the
defendant,
and I find on the balance of probabilities that this is because no
such notice was lodged with the Commission.
<P>

11	In telephone conversations on about 27 March and 20 April 1998, Mr Anstee
informed Mr Cunneen of the Office of State Revenue
that the defendant had
changed its address from 59 Mulga Road, Oatley to 97 Elizabeth Bay Road,
Elizabeth Bay.  Mr Anstee's evidence
is that he used the words `registered
office' but I regard that as unlikely.  Mr Cunneen made a handwritten note on
the defendant's
letter of 26 November 1997 that `Mr Anstee advised new address
is  97 Elizabeth Bay Road, Elizabeth Bay', and in two later handwritten
notes
Mr Cunneen used the word `address' rather than `registered office'.  While I do
not accept Mr Anstee's evidence that he used
the words `registered office', I
accept that Mr Cunneen orally agreed to note the change of address and to act
upon it in correspondence;
 but in fact the change of address was not recorded
in the plaintiff's computerised records until about 10 September 1998, the date
of a handwritten note by Mr Cunneen confirming that the address on the system
had been changed.  Mr Cunneen also spoke by telephone
with Mr Jordon of Elliott
Tuthill &amp; Co, the defendant's solicitors, to discuss payment of the duty,
but there is no evidence
that they discussed the defendant's address.
<P>

12	The evidence indicates that the defendant's request in his letter of 26
November 1997 to pay interest rather than a fine was
acceded to by Mr Cunneen
on the plaintiff's part in telephone conversations in March 1998.  But the
accounts given by Mr Anstee and
Mr Cunneen are sharply divergent.  Mr Anstee
says that he had a conversation with Mr Cunneen on 30 March in which Mr Cunneen
gave
him a calculation of interest up to Friday 3 April 1998 and when he told
Mr Cunneen that he could not pay by Friday, Mr Cunneen said:
<P>

	`That will be alright but please contact me when you are ready to pay the duty
so that I can calculate the precise amount of interest
you will have pay.'
<P>

	Mr Cunneen denies having said this.  He says he asked Mr Anstee when the duty
and interest, which he called a fine, would be paid,
and Mr Anstee promised to
phone back.  He says he spoke to Mr Anstee again on 3 April 1998, when Mr
Anstee said he would see his
solicitor that day and that the illness of his
partner and his secretary had taken up some of his time that week.  A letter
was written
by the plaintiff to the defendant on 6 April 1998 demanding payment
of $960,976.40, rather than the smaller amount of $480,490 plus
a fine or
interest of $55,289.26.  The plaintiff says that this letter and a subsequent
reminder of 1 May 1998 made it clear that
any offer by the plaintiff to accept
a lesser fine had been withdrawn and the full debt of duty and a 100% fine was
required to be
paid.  Mr Anstee says there were further telephone conversations
with Mr Cunneen after the letter of 6 April 1998, in which Mr Cunneen
concluded
by saying:
<P>

	`Could you please let me know as soon as you know what date you will be able
to pay so that I can calculate the interest that you
will owe on the stamp
duty.'
<P>

	Mr Cunneen denies having said this.  He says that such a statement would be
inconsistent with the instructions which he had received.
 
<P>

13	On these matters I prefer the evidence of Mr Cunneen to Mr Anstee.  I find
it inherently implausible that in all the circumstances
Mr Cunneen would have
made such accommodating statements as Mr Anstee attributes to him.  That
conclusion is reinforced by the fact
that (as noted below) on 21 April 1998 Mr
Cunneen referred the matter for legal debt recovery action, and the computer
record of
his notes of telephone conversations which was tendered by the
defendant (rather than the plaintiff) is consistent with Mr Cunneen's
evidence.
In summary, I find that the plaintiff had resiled from accepting a smaller
amount of interest rather than the full 100%
fine by the time it wrote to the
defendant on 6 April 1998, and that it communicated its new attitude to the
defendant by that letter
and in subsequent telephone conversations between Mr
Anstee and Mr Cunneen.
<P>

14	Having spoken to Mr Anstee on 20 April 1998, when Mr Anstee referred to
settlement of sale of another property, Mr Cunneen filled
out a form entitled
`Referral for legal debt recovery action stamp duties (impressed)', which is
dated 21 April 1998.  In that document
he drew attention to the change of
address advised by Mr Anstee and recorded the defendant's address as the
Elizabeth Bay address
with the word `note' next to the address, in capitals and
doubly underlined.  This is consistent with Mr Anstee's evidence, which
I
accept, that he drew Mr Cunneen's attention to the change of address in
telephone conversations on at least three occasions, namely
on about 27 March
1998, 20 April 1998 and in early May 1998.  I also accept that Mr Cunneen
assured Mr Anstee on each occasion that
the change of address would be recorded
and that correspondence would not thereafter go to the Oatley address, but I
find those conversations
were about the `address' rather than the `registered
office' of the company, and in particular there was no undertaking by Mr
Cunneen
to treat the Elizabeth Bay address as the address of the registered
office of the defendant.
<P>

15	By facsimile letter dated 12 May 1998, the Crown Solicitor's Office wrote to
Elliott Tuthill &amp; Co, saying that `a section
459E Creditor's Statutory
Demand was recently served on your client company'.  The amount of the demand
was not specified in the
letter, though by that time the defendants had
received several letters making a demand for stamp duty of $480,490 and a fine
of
the same amount.  The letter of 12 May 1998 expressed a concern that the
defendant may be attempting to divest itself of the property
without paying
stamp duty and stated that unless certain undertakings were received, this
Court would be approached for orders preventing
disposal of the property.  
<P>

16	Mr Anstee's evidence, which I accept, is that he was in his solicitor's
office when this letter was received.  He responded by
making inquiries with
his family and occupants of 59 Mulga Road, Oatley to ascertain whether the
documents had been received.  Mr
Anstee's evidence is that he made the
inquiries by telephone at about 3.45pm on 13 May 1998, in preparation for a
response by Elliott
Tuthill to the Crown Solicitor's letter, which required a
response by 5pm on that day.  Having made those inquiries, he instructed
Elliott Tuthill &amp; Co to write their letter to the Crown Solicitor of 13 May
1998, in which they said `we advise that no Section
459E Creditor's Statutory
Demand has been served.'  The letter also indicated that there was no proposal
to sell the Elizabeth Bay
property.
<P>

17	In fact the statutory demand was not served on 12 May 1998, as asserted by
the Crown Solicitor.  While I accept Mr Anstee's evidence
that he did not see a
copy of the demand until one was forwarded to Elliott Tuthill &amp; Co with the
Crown Solicitor's letter of
1 July 1998, I find that the statutory demand and
the accompanying affidavit were left at the house at 59 Mulga Road, Oatley on
the
afternoon of 13 May 1998.  
<P>

18	The evidence to this effect is not completely satisfactory.  The process
server who says he left the documents at 59 Mulga Road,
Mr Hewer, swore two
affidavits and gave oral evidence.  His evidence changed substantially over
time.  He initially said that he
handed the documents to a female employee at
the registered office, that he asked her whether the premises were the
registered office
of Paliflex, and whether she was authorised to accept service
of the demand on their behalf, and she answered in the affirmative.
 Eventually
his evidence was that the person to whom he handed the documents was not an
employee, he did not use the words `registered
office', and he did not ask her
whether she was authorised to accept service, but only whether she could take
the documents.  I am
satisfied, however, that he was at 59 Mulga Road, Oatley
on 13 May 1998 and that he left the statutory demand and affidavit with
a
female person at the door of the premises there.  His second affidavit annexes
a copy of an `Agent Work Sheet' which is a contemporaneous
record, and his
account of the house numbering of numbers 47 and 61 is consistent with Mr
Anstee's affidavit.  According to the work
sheet he spoke to a female at the
address who said `yes, it's downstairs and is just a garage, we'll pass it on'.
This is also consistent
with Mr Anstee's evidence that the office was in a
basement garage.  The evidence does not indicate the identity of the person who
took the documents from Mr Hewer, nor what happened to the documents
afterwards.
<P>

19	Mr Hewer's first affidavit of service was dated 18 May 1998 and was received
by Mr Staka, the member of the plaintiff's legal
debt recovery team who was
handling the defendant's file, on 21 May 1998.  Mr Staka acknowledged in
evidence that he had access to
Mr Cunneen's notes about the correct address of
the defendant at all relevant times.  He also acknowledged that the Crown
Solicitor
had forwarded to him a copy of Elliott Tuthill's letter of 13 May
1998 in which Elliott Tuthill denied that a statutory demand had
been served.
He did not respond to Elliott Tuthill, or cause a response to be given, until
11 June 1998, after the expiry of the
period for compliance with the statutory
demand.  By his letter of that date to Elliott Tuthill &amp; Co, he stated that
the statutory
demand and accompanying affidavit had been served on the
company's registered office on 13 May 1998, and that further steps to wind
the
company up would be taken if full payment of the stamp duty and fine was not
received by 18 June 1998.  Elliott Tuthill replied
on 19 June 1998, stating
that Mulga Road Oatley was not the registered office of the defendant, the
defendant was not in occupation,
and that no mail should be directed there.
The letter recorded that no reply had been made to the earlier letter of 13
May, and re-asserted
that no notice had been served.  It stated that loan funds
would shortly be available to enable payment of the duty to be made.
<P>

20	The plaintiff's summons for the winding up of the defendant, and the
accompanying affidavit, were left at 59 Mulga Road, Oatley
on 25 June 1998.  On
1 July 1998 the Crown Solicitor wrote to Elliott Tuthill &amp; Co asserting
that the statutory demand and summons
had been served at the registered office
of the company as recorded in the Commission's records.  Photocopies of the
affidavits of
service of the summons and demand, with annexed copies of the
documents which were served, were enclosed.
<P>

21	Mr Anstee says the summons and supporting affidavit which were left at 59
Mulga Road, Oatley were not received by him, notwithstanding
that he has made
inquiries of all the occupants.  It is curious that according to Mr Anstee,
neither the summons nor the demand was
received by him although they were both
physically at the premises at 59 Mulga Road, Oatley, while letters to the
defendant at that
address dated 29 May and 19 June 1998 were received Mr Anstee
and are annexed to his affidavit in these proceedings.  However, on
balance I
accept Mr Anstee's evidence that the summons, like the demand, was not received
by him, although little turns on this because
copies of all of the documents
were forwarded to the defendant's solicitors on 1 July 1998.  
<P>

	<b>Service of statutory demand</b>
<P>

22	The defendant's claim that the statutory demand was not properly served is
made on two grounds.  First it is said that the demand
was not in fact served
in the manner required by the Corporations Law.  Secondly, it is said that the
plaintiff is estopped from
asserting that service has been validly effected.

<P>

	<i>Service under the Corporations Law </i>
<P>

23	Prior to the amendments to the Corporations Law which took effect on 1 July
1998, the requirement of s.459E(1) to `serve on the
company a demand' was
explained by s.220.  According to s.220(1), a document may be served on a
company by (inter alia) leaving it
at the registered office of the company.
Section 220(2) says (relevantly) that the situation of the registered office of
the company,
where a notice of change of situation of the registered office has
been lodged as required by s.218, is the place the address of
which is
specified in the notice, the new address taking effect seven days after the
notice was lodged.  This is deemed to be true
irrespective of whether the
address of a different place is shown as the address of the registered office
the company in a return
or other document (other than a notice of change of
address) lodged afterwards.  
<P>

24	Literally, these provisions mean that if the demand is left at the address
which is the registered office of the company according
to the Commission's
records (the last notification of change of address having been lodged more
than seven days previously), then
the demand has been effectively served on the
company.  As far as effective service is concerned, this is the result
regardless of
whether the registered office has in fact been changed though not
notified to the Commission, and of whether the creditor is aware
that the
company no longer has an office there at the time when service is effected.
<P>

25	However, there are suggestions in cases that this literal construction needs
to be qualified.  I believe those cases should be
treated with caution.  Some
of the cases deal with service by post.  Section 109Y of the Corporations Law,
which follows similar
provisions in Commonwealth and State interpretation
statutes, says that service is taken to be effected `unless the contrary is
proved'.
 This permits the company to prove non-delivery, though proof of
non-receipt is not sufficient, as the High Court of Australia explained
in
<i>Fancourt v Mercantile Credits Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20154%20CLR%2087" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 154 CLR 87</a>;  see also <i>F P

<P>

26	Where service is effected by leaving the demand at the place recorded as the
registered office, rather than by posting it, the
statutory provisions to which
I have referred are conclusive and without qualification.  However, the courts
have recognised that
in some circumstances it would an abuse of process to
allow the creditor to take advantage of the company by relying on literal
compliance
with the statutory provisions for service.  In <i>Re Future Life
Enterprises Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2033%20NSWLR%20559" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 33 NSWLR 559</a> McLelland CJ in Eq agreed with
Santow J in the <i>F P Leonard Advertising </i>case that the earlier case law
is best explained by reference to the principle of abuse of process.  In the
<i>Future Life </i>case the registered office of the company was the office of
a firm of accountants.  In fact the accountants had had no contact with
the
company for several years.  Mail for the company had been passed on by the
accountants to an address which they had been given
for the company, but had
been returned unclaimed.  His Honour found no possible basis for suggesting an
abuse of process because
the solicitors for the creditor had done all they
reasonably could to ensure that fair notice of the statutory demand was given
to
those in control of the affairs of the company.  Similarly in <i>Cornick v
Brains Master Corporation </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1995/1710.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] FCA 1710</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2014%20ACLC%20269" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 14 ACLC 269</a> Whitlam J held that service
was effective when the creditor's agent left the documents under the door at
the recorded registered
office after normal office hours, and it transpired
that the company no longer occupied that address, though it was also relevant
in that case that the creditor's solicitors had sent a copy of the demand to
the business address of the company.
<P>

27	Conversely in <i>Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Abberwood Pty Ltd
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%202%20ACSR%2091" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 2 ACSR 91</a> a statement of claim in proceedings was served at the
address recorded as the defendant's registered office, which had been the
address
of the defendant's accountants until they moved two years previously.
Although the statement of claim was returned to the plaintiff's
office by the
current occupants of the address, with a note explaining that the defendant was
no longer there, the plaintiff proceeded
to sign judgment in default of
appearance.  The judgment was set aside on the ground that the statement of
claim had not been properly
served.  The issue of abuse of process was not
argued, and the principles enunciated by Waddell CJ in Eq may not be directly
applicable
to service of a statutory demand at the company's registered office.
However, as Santow J pointed out in the <i>F P Leonard Advertising </i>case (at
139), <i>Abberwood</i> was a clear case of abuse of process, since the evidence
indicated that the plaintiff knew that the documents had not come to the
defendant's attention, and was aware of the address of the defendant's place of
business and the identity of its accountants and
solicitors but had not brought
the statement of claim to their attention, and had made no reference to the
proceedings in discussions
with the defendant's representatives.
<P>

28	In <i>Duwina Trading SDN Bhd v Ion International Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2014%20ACLC%201603" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 14 ACLC
1603</a> a statutory demand was served by leaving it at the company's registered
office, which was the office of the company's former accountants.
 The
accountants told the solicitors who served the demand that the company's
registered office was no longer there.  This was not
correct.  But the creditor
and its solicitors did not communicate with the company during the period for
compliance with the statutory
demand.  When the company did not comply with the
demand, the creditor applied to wind it up in insolvency.  The company's
attempt
to set the winding up proceedings aside as an abuse of process was
unsuccessful.  There was no evidence that the creditor's solicitors
were aware
that the address of the registered office was of a firm of accountants who had
ceased to act for the company.  They subsequently
became aware that the
accountant who received the demand asserted that his office was not the
registered office of the company, but
that assertion was incorrect according to
the Commission's records.  Moore J held that even if it had been demonstrated
that the
creditor's solicitors knew the demand was unlikely to come to the
company's attention, that fact would have been insufficient to
establish an
abuse of process.  In his Honour's opinion, for an abuse of process to arise
there must other matters which demonstrate
that the application is made for an
improper purpose - for example, where a creditor who knows that the demand is
not likely to come
to the attention of the company allows the period for
compliance to pass and then seeks to press the company to undertake some act
for the creditor's benefit, making an application to wind up the company as
part of that process.  
<P>

29	In my opinion, it is clear in the present case that the statutory demand and
supporting affidavit have been effectively served
under the Corporations Law.
They were left at the address recorded in the Commission's records.  They were
left there with a person
who said she knew the company and would pass the
documents on to them (compare <i>Golden Orchid Pty Ltd v Comax Pty Ltd</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2058%20FCR%20113" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 58 FCR 113).</a>  I reject the defendant's submission that it should have
been obvious to Mr Hewer that the garage at Oatley was not the registered
office of the company because of the requirement of s.217 of the Corporations
Law that the registered office must be open for not
less than five hours
between 10am and 4pm each business day.  The recorded address of the registered
office was 59 Mulga Road, not
the garage at that address, and Mr Hewer's
evidence is that he did not closely observe the garage.
<P>

30	Before the demand was served the plaintiff was told, more than once, that
the defendant's address had changed, but I have found
that the words
`registered office' were not used in those communications.  Even if the words
`registered office' had been used, the
Commission's records had not changed.
Moreover, the fact that they were aware of a new address or registered office
did not mean
that the plaintiff's officers knew that the demand was unlikely to
come to the company's attention.  Mr Cunneen was aware, prior
to 13 May 1998,
that correspondence written to the defendant at the Oatley address had been
received by Mr Anstee, for Mr Anstee
himself deposes to conversations with Mr
Cunneen in which he acknowledged receipt of the plaintiff's letters of 6 April
and 1 May
1998.  Mr Cunneen was entitled to infer that Mr Anstee had
arrangements in place for passing on correspondence and documents addressed
to
the defendant at the Oatley address.  
<P>

31	It is true that the defendant's solicitors informed the plaintiff on 13 May
1998 that no demand had been served.  However, that
letter was written on the
day of service, and it was open to the plaintiff to infer that, service having
been effected at the registered
office, the demand would shortly come to the
attention of the defendant.  
<P>

32	The plaintiff could have sent a copy of the demand and affidavit to the
Elizabeth Bay address, and also to the defendant's solicitors.
 It could have
sent them a copy of Mr Hewer's first affidavit of service dated 18 May 1998.
But I do not believe its failure to take
these steps, though they may well have
been a prudent precaution, amounts to an abuse of process in the sense
discussed in the cases.
 I do not accept that there was any intentional
suppression of the demand until the expiry of the period for compliance, for
the
purpose of preventing the defendant from applying to set it aside.  While
the plaintiff was aware that the defendant initially claimed
that no stamp duty
was payable on the contract and transfer, apart from a nominal sum, the
defendant had subsequently undertaken
to pay the assessed duty and interest and
Mr Anstee and Mr Cunneen had several discussions about payment.  That being so,
it is unlikely
in my opinion that the plaintiff would have expected any
challenge to the demand.  My impression from Mr Staka's evidence is that
he is
inexperienced and not especially cautious but was not improperly motivated. 
<P>

	<i>The estoppel argument</i>
<P>

33	The defendant asserts that the plaintiff was estopped from denying that the
defendant's registered office was the Elizabeth Bay
address because the
plaintiff was notified of the change of registered office to the Elizabeth Bay
address on 27 March 1998 and in
subsequent telephone conversations.  I have
found that while Mr Anstee told Mr Cunneen that the defendant's address had
changed,
he did not use the words `registered office'.  But even if he did, my
opinion is that the facts would not support the asserted estoppel.
 At most, Mr
Cunneen agreed to note the new address on the plaintiff's file and send
correspondence to that address.  The facts do
not support an interference that
he represented that any documents to be served on the defendant would be served
only at the new
address, regardless of any legal advice the defendant may
subsequently receive as to the proper method of service.  Further, if (contrary
to my finding) Mr Anstee had said that the registered office had changed to the
Elizabeth Bay address, that statement would have
implied that all necessary
steps had been taken to make the change effective, and any representation made
by Mr Cunneen would have
been made on the assumption that that was true.  When
it appeared, over six weeks after the first conversation, that no notice of
change of registered office had been lodged with the Commission, the plaintiff
would have been entitled to resile from any representation
that it would serve
documents on the new address, if such a representation had been made. 
<P>

34	The plaintiff's course of conduct in not responding to Elliott Tuthill &amp;
Co's letter of 13 May 1998, and in not forwarding
Mr Hewer's affidavit of
service of 18 May 1998 to the defendant, does not assist the defendant to patch
up the factual deficiencies
of the estoppel argument.  It would have been
reasonable for officers of the plaintiff to assume that the statutory demand
had been
passed on to the defendants shortly after the letter of 13 May was
written, just as other correspondence had been passed on.  In
those
circumstances the plaintiff had no duty to send copies of the demand to the new
address or the solicitors.  The defendant says
that a letter from the plaintiff
to the defendant dated 29 May 1998 supported the defendant's belief that no
statutory demand had
been served.  The letter was marked to the attention of Mr
Anstee and said 
<P>

	`Please inform me whether you are still acting in this matter and, if so, what
action is being taken to satisfy the outstanding
requisitions.  In the absence
of any reply from you within 14 days from the date of this letter, all persons
primarily liable for
the duty will be contacted and requested to pay the
outstanding amount.'
<P>

	In the circumstances which obtained on 29 May 1998, by which time a statutory
demand had been served on the person primarily liable
for the duty, this letter
was nonsensical.  It cannot be relied on by the defendant as a justification
for any assumption.  
<P>

	<b>Defendant's claim that plaintiff is not a creditor</b>
<P>

35	The defendant contends that the debt for stamp duty is not owing having
regard to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/" class="autolink_findacts">Commonwealth Places (Mirror Taxes) Act 1998</a> (Cth), and
consequently the plaintiff is not a creditor of the defendant.  That being so,
the plaintiff has no standing under s.459P
to apply to the Court for the
defendant to be wound up in insolvency. 
<P>

36	In my opinion it is not open to the defendant to make this argument unless
the Court grants leave under s.459S.  Section 459S(1)
applies where an
application for a company to be wound up in insolvency relies on failure by the
company to comply with a statutory
demand.  The plaintiff's application in the
present proceedings relies solely on the defendant's failure to comply with the
statutory
demand which was served on 13 May 1998.  According to s.459S(1), the
defendant may not, without the leave of the Court, oppose the
plaintiff's
application on a ground that the company could have relied on for the purposes
of an application to set the demand aside.
 A challenge to the plaintiff's
application on the ground that the plaintiff is not a creditor and therefore
has no standing, is
a method of opposing the application, and therefore falls
within the ambit of s.459S(1).  The ground of opposition is that the defendant
is not indebted to the plaintiff, and therefore the plaintiff is not a creditor
of the defendant, and therefore the plaintiff has
no standing under s.459P.
That ground of opposition could have been relied on in an application to set
aside the statutory demand,
had an application been made in time.  In such an
application, the company would assert that the debt was not owing, and
therefore
there is a genuine dispute between the company and the respondent
about the existence of the debt to which the demand relates:  see
s.459H(1)(a).
It is true that formally speaking, the ground for challenging standing under
s.459P asserts that there is no debt,
while the ground for challenging a
statutory demand merely asserts that there is a genuine dispute about the
existence of the debt.
 But the subject matter of the contention is the
same.
<P>

37	Were it possible to raise the issue of indebtedness by challenging standing
under s. 459P after it had become too late to set
the demand aside by claiming
a genuine dispute about the existence of the debt, the policy underlying the
reform of the law of statutory
demands made by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/clra1992225/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporate Law Reform Act
1992</a> would be undermined.  As Gummow J noted in <i>David Grant &amp; Co Pty Ltd
(rec apptd) v Westpac Banking Corporation </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 43</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2018%20ACSR%20225" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 18 ACSR 225</a>, 227 the
provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/clra1992225/index.html#p5.4" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5.4</a> now constitute a legislative scheme for quick resolution
of the issue of solvency and the determination of whether the company should
be
wound up without the interposition of disputes about debts, unless they are
raised promptly.  
<P>

38	In my opinion, the scheme contemplates that disputes about the existence of
debts are to be resolved through the process of applying
to set aside the
statutory demand which relies on the debt.  The purpose of the reform was to
reduce the occasions when disputes
would arise about the debt at the hearing of
the winding up application:  Explanatory Memorandum to the Corporate Law Review
Bill
1992, para 685.  To that end, the provisions in relation to the setting
aside of a statutory demand are intended to be a complete
code for the
resolution of disputes involving statutory demands:  Explanatory Memorandum,
para 688.  The scheme `provides a means
of dealing with statutory demand
disputes in such a way that an alleged defect in the statutory demand does not
have the effect of
prolonging proceedings leading up to the commencement of a
winding up, by requiring debtor companies to raise genuine disputes (about,
for
example, whether a debt is owed) at an early stage, rather than after winding
up proceedings have commenced':  Explanatory Memorandum
para 689.  The
construction for which the defendant contends would fly in the teeth of the
legislative intention so revealed.  This
was the conclusion reached by Brownie
J in <i>House of Tan Pty Ltd v Beachiris Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2014%20ACLC%201536" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 14 ACLC 1536.</a>
<P>

39	Section 459S therefore precludes an argument that the applicant for winding
up on the ground of non-compliance with the a statutory
demand is not a
creditor under s.459P.  This was recognised by Master Sanderson in <i>Zann
Holdings Pty Ltd v Bay View Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2015%20ACLC%201238" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 15 ACLC 1238</a>, 1240.  A variation
of the argument, in which it was asserted that it was an abuse of process for
an applicant to seek winding up
in reliance on a statutory demand, because it
was not a creditor, was considered by Brownie J in <i>House of Tan Pty Ltd v
Beachiris Pty Ltd</i>.  His Honour said (14 ACLC at 1538-9):
<P>

	`In my judgment, the defendant does require the leave of the Court under
s.459S, if it is to litigate the issue.  Part 5.4 was
enacted to change a
branch of the law that was perceived to be unsatisfactory.  That branch of the
law included a multitude of cases
that proceeded on the basis that a company,
faced with winding up proceedings, might effectively defend itself by asserting
that
the alleged creditor was not in truth a creditor, in that the supposed
debt was disputed, so that the supposed creditor had no standing
to bring the
winding up proceedings.  The plain intention of the drafters of the
legislation, and of the Parliament, was to replace
that body of law with the
new procedure provided for in Part 5.4....
<P>

	The defendant contended that its application to restrain the plaintiff from
proceeding with the winding up proceedings was outside
the scope of the Part,
in that the application was brought under the Court's general powers.  In a
sense, this is correct, but ...
I conclude that this general power has been
limited by the enactment of the Part.  This conclusion carries with it the
consequence
that, if a company facing a winding up summons wishes to assert
that the plaintiff lacks the standing of a creditor, the company
must now take
that point by way of applying to set aside the statutory demand, or must obtain
leave under s.459S'.
<P>

	I respectfully agree with these observations.  I must therefore consider
whether this is an appropriate case in which to grant
leave under s.459S.
<P>

	<b>Leave under s.459S</b>
<P>

40	As I have already mentioned, s.459S applies, in the circumstances of the
present case, to prevent the defendant without the leave
of the Court from
opposing the plaintiff's application for winding up on a ground that the
defendant could have relied on for the
purposes of an application to set the
demand aside.  In the <i>David Grant </i>case (at 229) Gummow J acknowledged
the Court's statutory discretion under this provision, but in a context which
implied that the
discretion under s.459S should be used cautiously and even
sparingly given the overall policy of Part 5.4.  Nevertheless, as Hayne
J
observed in <i>Texel Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1994/62.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] VicRp 62</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACSR%20535" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11
ACSR 535</a>, 537, the discretion under s.459S is there as a `safety net' in the
sense that there are special cases in which a dispute as to the
existence of
the debt may be litigated at the time of the application for winding up in
insolvency, even if there has been no application
under s.459G.
<P>

41	The Court's task, therefore, is to identify circumstances in which it is
appropriate to provide a safety net for the company
in winding up proceedings,
without softening the legal policy of Part 5.4.  There are some semantic
problems created by s.459S, principally
by use of the word `ground', as Young J
noted in <i>Ketatos v Holmark Construction Co Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2018%20ACSR%20199" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 18 ACSR 199.</a>
Nevertheless, the section has comprehensible field of operation.  In my
opinion, s.459S operates by allowing the Court to grant leave
to the company to
oppose the application to wind it up on a ground <i>relevant to the winding up
application</i>.  It does not permit the company to litigate, at the winding up
stage, an application to set aside the statutory demand.  Where the
question of
indebtedness is raised in the winding up proceedings, the question is not
whether there is a genuine dispute about the
existence of the debt, but rather
whether the dispute about the debt affects the plaintiff's standing or the
ultimate question whether
the company is solvent.  The matter must be addressed
in three stages:  the first is whether leave should be granted to permit the
company to dispute the debt upon which the demand was based, and the second
(which arises if leave is granted) is whether the plaintiff
has standing as a
creditor under s.459P; and the third is whether the company is solvent, taking
into account the dispute about the
debt.  
<P>

42	The Court is precluded from granting leave under s.459S(2) unless it is
satisfied that the ground is material to proving that
the company is solvent:
s.459S(2).  Properly understood, subs.(2) is simply a corollary of the basic
proposition that the Court's
order to wind the company up is made only where
the company is an insolvent company (either in fact or because of a presumption
under
s.459C):  s.459A.  In <i>Master Paving Pty Ltd v Heading Contractors Pty
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2015%20ACLC%201025" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 15 ACLC 1025</a>, 1032 the Court observed that if the debt in the
statutory demand is small and the company's assets far exceed its liabilities
and
it is able to pay its debts as and when they become due and payable, then
the existence or otherwise of the debt will not be material
to the company's
solvency and leave will not be granted.  That is a safe proposition, as long as
both the `balance sheet' and `cashflow'
criteria are satisfied.  It does not
follow, of course, that the debt will not be material to solvency simply
because it is small
in comparison with the excess of assets over liabilities,
since the assets may be unrealisable or illiquid.  
<P>

43	In <i>Zann Holdings Pty Ltd v Bay View Holdings Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2015%20ACLC%201238" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 15 ACLC
1238</a>, 1241, Master Sanderson remarked that `it is necessary for a corporation
to show that the debt upon which the statutory demand is
based is the
difference between actual solvency and insolvency before leave under subs.(1)
can be granted'.  He continued:
<P>

	`In effect, if by ignoring the debt upon which the statutory demand is based,
the company might be found to be solvent, then, and
only then, the existence of
a bona fide dispute would be a relevant consideration....  In circumstances
where existence of the debt
on which the statutory demand is based is pivotal
to a decision on solvency, then the existence of the debt is a relevant
consideration.
 What the section seems designed to avoid is companies against
which an application for winding up based on the statutory demand
is pending,
challenging the standing of the applicant late in the day.'
<P>

44	With respect, those observations seem to set the materiality threshold too
high.  The Court considers the materiality question
before deciding whether to
grant leave to the company to dispute the debt.  It has not, at that stage,
reached a conclusion about
the company's overall solvency, and may not have
heard all the relevant evidence.  It is not in a position to decide, at that
stage,
whether the debt in question is the difference between solvency and
insolvency.  Further, Master Sanderson's formulation tends to
substitute
`decisive' for `material' in subs.(2).  In other contexts, `material' is taken
to refer to a likelihood or significant
propensity to affect an outcome, or
even a mere possibility of doing so:  see <i>Ford's Principles of Corporations
Law </i>(looseleaf) para [23.371] and cases there cited.
<P>

45	<i>The Roy Morgan Research Centre Pty Ltd v Wilson Market Research Pty Ltd
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2020%20ACSR%20108" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 20 ACSR 108</a> shows that an application may be made on general
equitable principles of abuse of process where an applicant to wind the company
up on the ground of actual insolvency relies on a disputed debt to provide
standing to apply.  The case does not raise the question
whether proceedings
for abuse of process are limited by s.459S because there was no statutory
demand involved in that case.  
<P>

46	In <i>Gradfan Pty Ltd (in liq) v Miling Nominees Pty Ltd </i>(1995) 19 ACSC
466 Master Ng dismissed applications to wind up the defendants on the ground of
insolvency, based on statutory demands,
for two reasons.  First, he found that
the debts relied upon in the demands could not have been owed to the plaintiff,
since they
were debts due to a trust of which the plaintiff was no longer the
trustee.  It followed, in his view, that the plaintiff had no
standing as a
creditor to apply for winding up orders.  In my respectful opinion there is a
flaw in this reasoning, in the assertion
that the question of indebtedness can
be considered under s.459P without regard to s.459S.  I prefer the reasoning of
Brownie J in
the <i>House of Tan</i> case.
<P>

47	Master Ng's second ground was that leave should be granted to permit the
question of indebtedness to be raised because the defendants
had behaved
reasonably in thinking that the plaintiff would not proceed once they
acknowledged indebtedness to the trust rather than
its former trustee.  To that
extent, the case is a useful indication of matters relevant to the exercise of
the discretion under
s.459S.  
<P>

48	The exercise of the Court's discretion under s.459S(1) does not lead to the
setting aside of the statutory demand and therefore
does not remove the
presumption of insolvency which arises under s.459C(2)(a).  Having granted
leave, the Court's task is to deal
with the proceedings for winding up, rather
than cutting away the demand which is their substratum.  The overall question
of solvency
is the critical issue.  If it emerges that the debt upon which the
applicant has relied is not owing, the Court may grant leave to
a creditor to
be substituted as applicant, and if that happens the new applicant may be able
to take advantage of the presumption
of insolvency which arose out of
non-compliance with the initial demand.  As Gummow J said in the <i>David Grant
</i>case (at 234), Part 5.4 may appear to operate harshly, but that is
consequence of the legislative scheme which has been adopted, and
in an
appropriate case the applicant for winding up may be restrained on the ground
of abuse of process.
<P>

49	In my opinion the exercise of the discretion to grant leave under s.459S(1)
involves three considerations, namely:  
<P>

	(i)  a preliminary consideration of the defendant's basis for disputing the
debt which was the subject of the demand;
<P>

	(ii)  an examination of the reason why the issue of indebtedness was not
raised in an application to set aside the demand, and
the reasonableness of the
party's conduct at that time;  and
<P>

	(iii)  an investigation of whether the dispute about the debt is material to
proving that the company is solvent.
<P>

	<i>The dispute about the debt</i>
<P>

50	In argument before me the plaintiff relied on a construction of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/" class="autolink_findacts">Commonwealth Places (Mirror Taxes) Act 1998</a> (Cth) to demonstrate that no debt
was owing for stamp duty.  The plaintiff relies on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7</a> of the Act, which
provides:
<P>

	`7(1)  An applied law does not have effect in relation to an amount that would
(apart from this sub-section) have become due for
payment before 6 October 1997
under the applied law.  
<P>

	(2) In determining whether an amount is or was payable under an applied law,
it must be assumed that all obligations of any relevant
person that arose
before 6 October 1997 had been fully and promptly complied with.
<P>

	(3) An applied law does not have effect in relation to an amount that would
(apart from this sub-section) have become due for payment
as stamp duty on an
instrument made before 6 October 1997.
<P>

	(4) In determining whether an amount is or was payable under an applied law
relating to stamp duty, it must be assumed that:
<P>

	(a) all relevant instruments made before 6 October 1997 were lodged for
assessment at stamp duty;  and
<P>

	(b) the stamp duty (if any) on those instruments was assessed and paid.'
<P>

51	In the present case the contract for sale between the Commonwealth of
Australia and the defendant was made on 5 September 1997.
 The defendant says
that the effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7</a> is that no NSW stamp duty is payable on the contract.
The contract is a relevant instrument made before 6 October 1997, and under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7</a>
it must be assumed it was lodged for assessment of stamp duty and that stamp
duty was assessed and paid.  
<P>

52	In my opinion there is a simple answer to this contention.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 7</a> only
applies to an `applied law'.  An applied law is defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.3</a> to mean the
provisions of a State taxing law that apply in relation to a Commonwealth place
<i>in accordance with this Act</i> (emphasis supplied).  If a State stamp duty
law applies of its own force to an instrument, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7</a> is irrelevant.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 7</a>
only comes into play when the State stamp duty law does not apply of its own
force because the instrument relates to a Commonwealth
place and paragraph
52(i) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> prevents the State law from applying to that place.
In such a case, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.6</a> of the Act provides in part:
<P>

	`6(1) 	In this section:
<P>

	<b>Excluded provisions</b>, in relation to a State taxing law, means
provisions of that law to the extent that they are excluded by paragraph 52(i)
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.
<P>

	(2) Subject to this Act, the excluded provisions of a State taxing law, as in
force at any time before or after the commencement
of this Act, apply, or are
taken to have applied, according to their tenure, at that time, in relation to
each place in the State
that is or was a Commonwealth place at that time.'
<P>

53	In <i>Allders International Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue</i>
(1996) 140 ALR 189 the High Court held that a lease of a duty free store at an
airport, which was a Commonwealth place for the purposes
of paragraph 52(i) of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, was exempt from State stamp duty.  According to the
explanatory memorandum to the Bill for the Act, the Bill was part of a package
which represented the Government's legislative response to the <i>Allders
International </i>case.  The purpose of the provisions of the Bill is to ensure
that taxes which mirror State taxes such as stamp duties (inter alia)
apply in
relation to Commonwealth places in the same State:  explanation memorandum,
paragraph 1.2.
<P>

54	Thus, s.6 of the Act, exercising the exclusive power of the Commonwealth to
legislate in respect of Commonwealth places, provides
that by force of
Commonwealth law the State taxing law applies to Commonwealth places in the
State.  It is only those `applied laws'
which fall within s.7.
<P>

55	The plaintiff says that in the present case, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act 1920</a> (NSW)
is not an applied law because its direct application is not excluded by
paragraph 52(i) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.  The defendant's submission that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7</a>
applies carries with it the implication that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a> is an applied
law, and therefore that the contract for sale in the present case would not be
subject to stamp duty but for the Act,
having regard to paragraph 52(i) of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.
<P>

56	Understood in this fashion, the dispute between the plaintiff and the
defendant involves a matter arising under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> or involving its
interpretation, and it is the duty of this Court not to proceed unless and
until the Court is satisfied that appropriate
notice has been given to the
Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth and the States:  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act 1903</a>
(Cth), <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s78b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.78B.</a>  The orders which I propose to make will ensure that this duty is
discharged.  For the purpose of assessing whether to grant leave
under s.459S,
it is sufficient for me to say that in my opinion, there is a plausible
argument to be made for the defendant's contention;
 to put it another way, the
defendant's case is not so hopeless that I should deprive it of the opportunity
of developing its case
for this reason alone.  
<P>

	<i>The reason for the company not applying to set aside the demand</i>
<P>

57	As mentioned earlier, the Court must balance the legislative policy of
preventing disputes about debts from being raised at the
winding up stage,
against the potentially harsh effect of the 21 day time limit for challenging a
statutory demand, which was held
in the <i>David Grant </i>case not to be
capable of extension.  In the present case, I have found that Mr Anstee (who
for practical purposes is equivalent to
the defendant) did not receive the
statutory demand and supporting affidavit until after the expiration of the 21
day period.  He
was aware that the plaintiff claimed to have served the
documents on 12 May 1998 (a claim which was clearly false).  He was also
aware
that his solicitor had written to the plaintiff's solicitor on 13 May 1998
denying that service had taken place.  In my opinion,
it was reasonable for him
in these circumstances to wait for a reply to the letter of 13 May, provided
that he also made all reasonable
inquiries to discover whether the documents
had in fact been left at 59 Mulga Road, Oatley.  I have accepted his evidence
that he
made inquiries of his own family and the occupants of 59 Mulga Road and
I regard those inquiries as reasonable.  While whatever he
might have done had
not led to the lodgment of a notice of change of registered office from Oatley
to Elizabeth Bay, he had at least
informed Mr Cunneen several times that the
defendant's address had changed to the Elizabeth Bay address.  
<P>

58	It is also relevant to the exercise of my discretion that the plaintiff
might have taken steps to provide a copy of the demand
and supporting affidavit
to the defendant, either by sending them to Elizabeth Bay or to the defendant's
solicitors, but they did
neither.  While their conduct did not fall to the
level of the creditor's conduct in the <i>Abberwood</i> case, and did not
otherwise provide the basis for a case of abuse of process, it did not live up
to the punctilious standard observed
in <i>Re Future Life Enterprises</i>.  
<P>

	<i>Materiality of the dispute about the debt to proof of  insolvency</i>
<P>

59	The evidence relating to the company's solvency is quite thin at the present
time.  The defendant foreshadowed that it would
seek leave to adduce further
evidence on the issue of solvency once the question of leave under s.459S was
determined.  
<P>

60	The evidence before me is that the defendant owns the property at 97
Elizabeth Bay Road, Elizabeth Bay, which was valued by the
Valuer General at
$12.5 million.  That appears to be the only substantial asset of the defendant.
According to Mr Anstee's affidavit
in the proceedings, the defendant has debts
of approximately $9.5 million.  The debts are not specified, but there is
affidavit evidence
that Elliott &amp; Tuthill (Mortgages) Pty Ltd is the first
registered mortgagee over the property.  The amount advanced is $6.6
million
and the term of the mortgage expires on 8 October 1999.  According to that
evidence, the first mortgagee is able and prepared
to advance a further $1
million subject to the consent of the other mortgagees registered on the title
and to the valuation of the
property being not less than $11,516,000.  
<P>

61	Further affidavit evidence is that there is a second mortgage to Presland
Properties Pty Ltd to secure an amount of $900,000,
and a third mortgage to
Southern Finance and Investment Pty Ltd to secure an advance of $1,780,450.
The total amount secured by the
three mortgages is $9,280,450.  The third
mortgage falls due on 10 June 1999 but there is no information about the due
date of the
second mortgage.  There is no information about the interest rates
charged by the mortgagees, nor about the cash flow of the mortgagor.
 
<P>

62	Apart from its secured debts, the company has current council, water and
electricity accounts which may be outstanding.  It is
has a bank account with
the National Australia Bank at Hurstville.  During the period from 19 June to 9
September 1998 the maximum
credit was $55,452.22 and the maximum debit was
$10,934.82.  During that period the company was charged a reference fee for
permitting
overdrawings on five occasions.
<P>

63	If the question of standing is overcome, the defendant will need to adduce
clear evidence of solvency in order to overcome the
statutory presumption of
insolvency which currently operates against it under s.459C(2)(a).  Given the
relative illiquidity of company's
sole substantial asset, the excess in value
of that asset over liabilities may not be of any real significance.  If the
defendant
is required to pay the whole of the debt claimed by the plaintiff,
the evidence suggests that that amount can be obtained wholly
from the first
mortgagee if the other mortgagees consent, but it is unclear whether they will
do so.  There is also an undrawn facility
in the third mortgage of a little
over $200,000.  
<P>

64	In these circumstances, it cannot be seriously doubted that the argument as
to the existence of the debt claimed by the plaintiff
is material to proving
the solvency of the defendant, even in the absence of evidence of cashflow.  If
the second and third mortgagees
refuse to consent to a further loan by the
first mortgagee, or the first mortgagee's valuation does not meet the threshold
amount
which it requires, it will not be possible to raise funds to pay the
plaintiff's claim without selling the property, and so the company
will be
unable to pay the debt to the plaintiff (if there is one) which will have
already fallen due.  If the plaintiff's claim does
not have to be paid, then
the question will be whether the plaintiff is solvent in the normal sense, and
that will largely depend
on e&#180;vidence about cashflow which has not yet
been tendered. 
<P>

	<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

65	Although
<P>

	*	the statutory demand and supporting affidavit have been validly served on
the defendant and there is no abuse of process involved
in relying on that
valid service;  and
<P>

	*	no estoppel operates against the plaintiff to prevent it from relying on
valid service;  and
<P>

	*	the defendant cannot challenge the standing of the plaintiff as creditor
under s.459P without first obtaining leave under s.459S(1);
<P>

	I have come to the conclusion in the exercise of my discretion that this is an
appropriate case in which to grant leave to the
defendant under s.459S(1) to
contest the question whether it is indebted the plaintiff at all.  The contest
as to whether there is
such a debt is wholly or substantially a matter arising
under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> or involving its interpretation.  Therefore I propose to
direct the defendant to give s.78B notices to the Commonwealth and State
Attorneys-General so that the matter may proceed to a determination.
<P>

66	Given that that process will involve a certain amount of time, I believe it
is appropriate to grant leave to the parties to provide
further evidence on the
question of solvency in the meantime.  I have considered whether I should make
my orders conditional the
defendant paying some money into court or otherwise
securing the indebtedness which it may eventually be found to have.  I have
decided
that it is not appropriate to impose such a requirement as a condition
of granting the relief which has been sought.  This is because
the relief is
specifically intended to permit the defendant to argue that it is not indebted
to the plaintiff;  and to require it
to pay out the whole or a significant part
of that amount pending the resolution of the dispute may impose some hardship
on the defendant
which proves in the end to have been totally unjustified. 
<P>

67	I therefore propose to make orders along the following lines:
<P>

	(a)	to grant leave to the defendant under s.459S(1) to oppose the plaintiff's
application for orders for the winding up of the
defendant on the ground that
the amount claimed in the statutory demand served by the plaintiff on the
defendant on 13 May 1998 is
not a debt due and payable by the defendant to the
plaintiff;
<P>

	(b) to direct the defendant to give notice of this cause under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s78b.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 78B</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act 1903</a> (Cth) to the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth and
of the States, within seven days of the making of my orders;  
<P>

	(c) to direct that the defendant file and serve on the plaintiff within seven
days any further affidavit evidence upon which it
proposes to rely on the
question of the defendant's solvency;
<P>

	(d) to direct that the plaintiff file and serve on the within 14 days any
affidavit evidence upon which it proposes to rely on
the question of the
defendant's solvency;
<P>

	(e) to direct that the defendant file and serve on the plaintiff within 21
days any further affidavit evidence on which it proposes
to rely in reply to
the plaintiff's affidavits on the question of the defendant's solvency.
<P>

68	On 18 December 1998 I made an order pursuant to s.459R(2) that the period
within which the plaintiff's application in the summons
must be determined is
extended up to and including Monday 8 February 1999, and I stood the matter
over to the Company List before
me on that day.  I propose to make orders on
that day and I direct the plaintiff to prepare draft short minutes of order for
that
purpose.  I shall hear submissions as to costs at that time.
