<P>

<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Statement of claim be struck out;</b>
<P>

<b> default judgment be entered; Stay of</b>
<P>

<b>proceedings;  amend statement of claim)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed 6 August 1997 the first
and third defendants seek that the amended statement of claim filed on 23 April
1997 be struck out or alternatively that the amended statement of claim be
struck out so far as it relates to the claims made by
the first and third
defendants.  By notice of motion filed 10 September 1997 the second defendant
also seeks that the amended statement
of claim filed on 23 April 1997 be struck
out or alternatively that the amended statement of claim be struck out in so
far as it
relates to the claims of the first plaintiff and third plaintiff.
The first and third defendants relied on an affidavit of Wayne
Vincent
Annis-Brown sworn 7 August 1997 and the second defendant relied on affidavits
of Camilla Whalen sworn 4 and 11 August 1997.
<P>

2  	The plaintiffs have filed two motions both on 11 May 1999.  The
first motion (called A) seeks that the proposed (but not yet
served notice of
motion) be struck out as an abuse of process and secondly that judgment be
entered in favour of the first to third
defendants due to failure to comply
with the Supreme Court Rules.  Although the plaintiffs refer to judgment being
entered in favour
of the defendants this appears to be a typographical error
and the plaintiffs would be seeking that default judgment be entered in
their
favour.  The second longer motion (called B) also filed on 11 May 1999 seeks
that these proceedings be stayed pending an application
to the Federal Court of
Australia seeking leave to appeal against a judgment of Wilcox J in Nos NG 7787
and NG 7788 of 1997 following
the misleading of Wilcox J;  secondly, leave to
further amend as a result of continuing harassment and by adding the further
claim
pursuant to s 12BC of the <b>Australian Securities and Investments
Commission Act</b> 1989 and thirdly, that the hearing of the defendants' notice
of motion now before this court (but not yet served on the plaintiffs)
be
vacated.  Mr Campbell relied on two affidavits sworn by him on 7 and 9 May
1999.  The orders sought by the plaintiffs namely that
the notices of motion
not be served and that the hearing date be vacated are no longer being pursued.
Mr Campbell acknowledged that
service of the notice of motion had been
effected.  He also stated that he was in a position to argue the notices of
motion.
<P>

3  	In these proceedings, the first plaintiff is Keith Malcolm
Campbell the second plaintiff is Lois Audrey Campbell and the third
plaintiff
is Arnoya Holdings Pty Limited (the company).  The first and second plaintiffs
are married and were officers of the third
defendant.  The second plaintiff has
written a letter which requested that her husband represent her when these
motions were heard
before the court.  I granted leave for the first plaintiff
to represent the second plaintiff.  Mr Campbell also purportedly acted
for the
third plaintiff and his submissions in relation to the third defendant were
heard.  The first defendant is Metway Leasing
Limited, the second defendant is
Pigott Stinson Stuart Thoms, a firm of solicitors, and the third defendant is
Metway Bank Limited.
<P>

4  	On 19 December 1995 the statement of claim was filed.  The
defendants accept, solely for the argument of these motions, that
at the time
that the statement of claim was filed both Mr and Mrs Campbell were competent
to bring proceedings.  However on 6 June
1996 an order for sequestration was
made against the estate of Mr Campbell.  On 4 April 1997 a sequestration order
was made against
the estate of Mrs Campbell.  
<P>

5  	On 10 March 1997 the court ordered that Arnoya Holdings Pty
Limited be wound up under the <b>Corporations (NSW) Act - Corporations Law</b>
and that James Millar of Ernst &amp; Young be appointed liquidator of the
defendant company.  The first plaintiff admitted that both
he and the second
plaintiff are still bankrupt.  However on 5 July 1999 an application was lodged
on their behalf in the Federal
Court seeking to have those bankruptcies
annulled.  
<P>

6  	There is a history between these parties which was helpfully set
out by McInerney J in his judgment in these proceedings.  I
respectfully repeat
them.  They are as follows:
<P>

<b>"[A] JVA [joint venture agreement] was made between Baystan Pty Limited
(Baystan) and Prudential Finance Limited (Prudential).  It
related to the
refurbishment and construction of home units at 57 Lindfield Avenue, Lindfield.
Prudential made advances to Baystan
and these were secured by Mortgage.  There
was default.  The first defendant purchased Prudential.  It brought proceedings
against
Baystan.</b>
<P>

<b>A compromise was then reached.  On 18 December 1990, a Deed of Settlement
was executed.  The parties were Baystan, the first and second
plaintiffs and
the first defendant.  It was a document intended to implement the compromise
reached.  There was agreement to the
discharge of the earlier Mortgage given by
Baystan.  Broadly speaking, there were releases and relinquishments made in
respect of
JVA.  There was agreement to pay a sum of $2,400,000 (being part of
the monies claimed).  This sum was paid by the due date.  In
a general sense,
the Deed may be said to have made provision for the giving of security for the
payment of a further sum of $58,000
(which has been described as a shortfall)
and any interest accruing thereon.  The first and second plaintiffs (who are
referred to
therein as Guarantors) agreed to execute second Mortgages over two
properties.  The Mortgages were duly given.</b>
<P>

<b>There was default in payment of the sum of $58,000.  On 15 November 1991,
the first defendant commenced proceedings in this Court.
 The proceedings were
disposed of at first instance on 26 April 1995, when the first defendant
obtained judgment against all of the
plaintiffs and Baystan <i>[Metway Leasing
Limited v Arnoya Holdings Pty Ltd</i> (unreported, SCNSW, Barr AJ, 26 April
1995)]."</b>
<P>

7  	On 9 April 1997 McInerney J gave the plaintiffs leave to amend
their statement of claim in these proceedings within 14 days.
 An amended
statement of claim was filed on 23 April 1997.  Paragraph (37) of the amended
statement of claim pleads that the conduct
outlined in paras (20) to (35) was
conduct against the first and/or second and/or third plaintiffs engaged in or
on behalf of the
first and/or second defendant and/or third defendant in breach
of s 55 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a></b> 1987 (NSW).  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 55</a> of the
<b>Act</b> provides:
<P>

<b>"Harassment and coercion </b>
<P>

<b>A person shall not use physical force or undue harassment or coercion in
connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or
services to a
consumer or the payment for goods or services by a consumer."</b>
<P>

8  	Paragraph (38) pleads that as a consequence of the defendants'
conduct the first and second plaintiffs have suffered loss and
damage.
Particulars of loss and damage are pain and suffering, including but not
limited to post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
 No claim has been pleaded,
nor could there be a serious allegation that the third plaintiff (a company)
has suffered personal injury.
 Paragraphs (52) and (53) of the ASC plead that
the second defendant has aided and abetted or been a party to contraventions by
Metway
Leasing and Metway.  
<P>

9  	The allegations pleaded in paras (20) to (35) are serious.  They,
in part, concern alleged actions of solicitors involved in
the hearing of
proceedings <b><u>Metway Leasing Ltd v Arnoya Holdings Pty Ltd</u></b> before
Barr AJ (as he then was).  Paragraph (20) complains about the actions of the
defendants' solicitor when he sought sequestration
orders against the first and
second plaintiffs.  The allegation that the bankruptcy proceedings were
commenced for an improper purpose
was argued before the Court of Appeal.
<P>

10  	The Court of Appeal in <b><u>Arnoya Holdings Pty Limited v
Metway Leasing Limited</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/120.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCA 120</a> dismissed the appeal from Barr
AJ's decision.  At pages 2 and 3 the Court of Appeal referred to the annulment
proceedings before
Wilcox J and the allegations that the bankruptcy proceedings
have been commenced for an illegitimate purpose.  (These are the same
allegations raised in para (20) of the amended statement of claim in these
proceedings).  They found no substance in these allegations.
 Sheller JA with
whom Powell and Beazley agreed, considered the effect of s 60(4) of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a> </b>1966.  Before I refer to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60(4)</a>, it should be stated
that s 58 (1) of the Act provides:
<P>

<b>"58	Vesting of property upon bankruptcy</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	Subject to this Act, where a debtor becomes a bankrupt:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the property of the bankruptcy, not being after-acquired property, vests
forthwith in the Official Trustee or, if, at the time
when the debtor becomes a
bankrupt, a registered trustee becomes the trustee of the estate of the
bankrupt by virtue of section 156A,
in that registered trustee;  and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	after-acquired property of the bankrupt vests, as soon as it is acquired
by, or devolves on, the bankrupt, in the Official Trustee
or, if a registered
trustee is the trustee of the estate of the bankrupt, in that registered
trustee. ..."</b>
<P>

11  	Thus the property of the bankrupt upon bankruptcy vests in the
Official Trustee.
<P>

12  	The Court of Appeal referred to the provisions of s 60(2) of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a></b>.  Sheller JA stated:
<P>

<b>"Section 60(2) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a></i> provides that an action
commenced by a person, who subsequently becomes a bankrupt, is, upon his or her
becoming a bankrupt, stayed
until the trustee makes election in writing to
prosecute or discontinue the action.  Subsection (3) provides if the trustee
does
not make such an election within 28 days after notice of the action is
served upon him or her by a defendant or other party to the
action, he or she
shall be deemed to have abandoned the action.  Subsection (4) provides that
notwithstanding anything contained
in this section, a bankrupt may continue in
his or her own name, an action commenced by him or her before he or she became
a bankrupt,
his or her spouse or a member of his or her family, or, (b) the
death of his or her spouse or of a member of his or her family."</b>
<P>

13  	On 5 May 1997 the defendants' solicitors wrote to the Official
Trustee in Bankruptcy.  The letter stated that shortly after
Mr Campbell became
bankrupt, the Official Trustee elected not to continue with the proceedings in
the Supreme Court.  However they
did not presently know whether or not the same
election was made in respect of Mrs Campbell.
<P>

14  	On 11 July 1997 the Official Receiver wrote to the defendant's
solicitors.  The letter confirmed that the Official Trustee
did not propose to
continue on behalf of Lois Campbell the bankrupt in these proceedings.  The
Federal Court ordered the Official
Trustee had until 26 August 1996 to make an
election whether to prosecute or discontinue the proceedings of Mr Campbell
against the
second defendant.  No election was made by that date and according
to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 63</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a></b> 1966 the claim by Mr Campbell was
deemed to have been abandoned.  The Official Trustee confirmed that the
proceedings had been abandoned
by letter dated 5 September 1996.
<P>

15  	At p 7 of the Court of Appeal decision in <b><u>Arnoya Holdings
v Metway Leasing Pty Ltd</u></b> the court in relation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60(4)</a> said:
<P>

<b>"In determining whether or not the action can be regarded as one in respect
of any personal injury or wrong done to the bankrupt,
Handley JA referred to
the following passage from the judgment of Sir Owen Dixon in <i>Cox v Journeaux
and Ors [No 2]</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1935/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1935] HCA 48</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281935%29%2052%20CLR%20713" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1935) 52 CLR 713</a> at 721.  Sir Owen Dixon said:</b>
<P>

<b>`The test appears to be whether the damages or part of them are to be
estimated by immediate reference to pain felt by the bankrupt
in respect of his
mind, body or character and without reference to his rights of
property.'"</b>
<P>

16  	The Court of Appeal also referred to a passage from the judgment
of Handley JA in <b><u>Mannigel v Hewlett Phelps</u></b> (unreported, NSWCA 1
June 1991) where he said:
<P>

<b>"The plaintiffs claimed damages in the proceedings in the manner
particularised in para 17 (e), (I) and (g) of their amended statement
of claim
but these claims were consequential upon alleged breaches of professional duty
owed to them by the defendants in relation
to the purchase of the land and the
contract by the vendor to erect a dwelling house on it.  The plaintiff's claims
for damages for
loss of credit for mental distress, inconvenience and for
injury to their physical and mental health therefore were not claims `without
reference to their rights of property' within the principle stated by Dixon J.
On the contrary, those claims were consequential on
damages to the plaintiff's
financial and property interest as a result of alleged breaches of professional
duty by the solicitors."</b>
<P>

17  	Paragraph (36) of the amended statement of claim alleges that
harassment and/or coercion was "in connection with the payments
due to the
first defendant of the sum of $58,000 plus interest owing under the 18 December
1990 deed".  It is my view that the personal
injury or wrong that the first and
second plaintiffs allege to have suffered are made with reference of their
rights in relation
to the $58,000.  I am satisfied that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60</a> of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a></b> applies to these proceedings and the Trustees in
Bankruptcy have elected not to pursue these proceedings.  Therefore the
statement
of claim should be dismissed as against first and second
plaintiffs.
<P>

18  	On 26 June 1997 the liquidator of Arnoya Holding Pty Limited (in
Liq) advised the plaintiffs' solicitors that after consulting
with creditors of
the administration he decided that he would not be pursuing proceedings in the
Supreme Court which were initiated
by Arnoya prior to his appointment.  He
referred specifically to these proceedings.  As the liquidator has elected not
to pursue
these proceedings, it is my view that the statement of claim should
be dismissed as against the third plaintiff.
<P>

19  	However the first plaintiff urged the court not to dismiss the
statement of claim at this point in time but rather await the
outcome of the
first and second plaintiffs' application to have the bankruptcy annulled.  The
plaintiffs opposed this course of action
because it submitted that the
proceedings should not be held up while the second application is made
particularly after the bankruptcies
occurred as long as three years ago.  It is
my view that the proceedings should not further be delayed while this court
awaits the
outcome of the first and second plaintiffs' application in the
Federal Court.  Some of the issues raised in Mr and Mrs Campbell's
affidavit in
the Federal Court have previously been considered by Wilcox J who dismissed
their earlier application for an annulment.
It is unlikely that the bankruptcy
proceedings will be annulled at this late stage.
<P>

20  	If I am wrong and the statement of claim should not be struck
out the defendant in motion A has sought that default judgment
be entered on
the basis that the first and third defendants have not filed their defence
within the time period stipulated under
the rules, namely 14 days.  The first
and third defendants say that they are in a position to file a defence within
the next few
days.  It would be my view that even though the defendants are in
default of the timetable they should be given a further opportunity
to file the
defence and I would extend the time for filing the defence for a further 7
days.
<P>

21  	In the plaintiffs' motion B it seeks that proceedings be stayed
pending an application to the Federal Court seeking leave to
appeal against the
judgment of Wilcox J.  Einfeld J in the Federal Court refused leave to Mr and
Mrs Campbell to appeal from the
decision of Wilcox J of the 1 September 1998.
As the application for leave has been determined there is no longer a need for
a stay
of proceedings.  The plaintiffs also seek leave to further amend the
statement of claim as a result of continuing harassment by adding
a further
claim pursuant to s 12B of the <b>Australian Securities and Investment
Commission Act</b> 1989.  As I have already dismissed the statement of claim it
would be futile to make such an order and I refuse to do so.  
<P>

22  	As the defendants were successful in obtaining the orders they
sought in the notices of motion they would normally be awarded
their costs.
However as the first and second plaintiffs are bankrupt and the third defendant
is in liquidation it is debatable whether
a costs order would have any utility.
It is noted that no order for costs was made in the Court of Appeal.  I grant
liberty to the
plaintiff to apply to argue the issue of awarding them their
costs of the notices of motion.
<P>

23  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The amended statement of claim filed on 23 April 1997 is struck out.
<P>

(2)	The plaintiffs' two notices of motions filed 11 May 1999 are dismissed.
<P>

(3)	Liberty to the defendants to restore the matter to argue the issue of
whether they should be awarded the costs of their notices
of motion.
