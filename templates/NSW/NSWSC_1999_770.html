<P>

<b>NO 55013/98  -  A NOLASCO PTY LIMITED V RICHARD ELLIOT GREEN</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT:</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  There is before the court for hearing an
amended notice of motion filed by the defendant on 6 July 1999.
<P>

	The notice of motion seeks orders in the following terms: -
<P>

<i>2A.	The Plaintiff file and serve all statements, including expert reports,
upon which it proposes to rely in support of its Summons
by 4.00pm on 6 August
1999.</i>
<P>

<i>2B.	The Plaintiff provide security for costs of the Defendant by way of bank
guarantee in the sum of $150,000 by 23 July 1999.</i>
<P>

<i>2C.	The proceedings stand dismissed if the Plaintiff fails to comply with
either order 2A or order 2B.</i>
<P>

<i>2D.	The Plaintiff pay the costs of the Defendant on an indemnity basis if
the Plaintiff fails to comply with either order 2A or order
2B.</i>
<P>

2   	The proceedings have a sorry history from the perspective
of the plaintiff's attendance to prosecuting the proceedings.  They
began on 1
April 1998 when a summons was issued. The plaintiff is A Nolasco Pty Limited.
The defendant is Mr Richard Elliot Green.
<P>

3   	As I understand the position, the plaintiff asserts that
the shareholding in the plaintiff is held by Mr Arides Nolasco.  Any
shares in
the company owned by Ms Maria Zaharia, Mr Nolasco's wife, are said to be owned
by her in trust for Mr Nolasco.
<P>

4   	On 27 April 1998 his Honour Hunter J ordered that a notice
of motion for security for costs be filed within fourteen days and
a defence
and cross claim filed within twenty eight days.
<P>

5   	The defendant filed a notice of motion seeking security for
costs on 8 May 1998, which motion was stood over on 16 May 1998
until 19 June
1998.
<P>

6   	A defence was filed on 12 June 1998 and a cross claim was
filed on 16 June 1998. 
<P>

7   	On 26 June 1998, Hunter J ordered, inter alia, that the
defendant's notice of motion for security for costs be stood over for
hearing
on 27 April 1998. 
<P>

8   	On 17 July 1998 Hunter J stood the notice of motion for
security for costs over to 7 August 1998 and on 17 July 1998, Hunter
J ordered
that the notice of motion be stood over until 21 August 1998.
<P>

9   	On 4 September 1998, security for costs was furnished. That
security took the form of a deed and an undertaking to the Court,
given
respectively by Mr Nolasco and by Ms Maria Zaharia and in each case given in
the same terms. The form of the undertakings dated
16 September 1998, comprised
an undertaking to the Court "to provide the defendant with at least fourteen
days notice prior to dealing
with any of the assets owned by me (jointly or
otherwise) having a value in excess of $10,000."
<P>

10   	The deed of 16 September 1998 executed by each of those
persons as guarantors, provided that the guarantor promised the defendant
that:-
<P>

<i>". . . if the Plaintiff does not pay to the Defendant all costs which the
Plaintiff may have been ordered to pay to the Defendant
in the proceedings, the
guarantor will pay to the Defendant whatever is required to make good the
Plaintiff's default to a limit
of $95,000". </i>
<P>

11   	On 18 September 1998, Hunter J gave directions which
required as follows:
<P>

<i>"(a) the defendant cross claimant to file and serve an amended cross claim
within fourteen days.</i>
<P>

<i>(b) the cross defendant to file and serve a defence to the cross claim
within twenty eight days. </i>
<P>

<i>(c) the plaintiff and cross claimant's statements to be served by 21
December 1998,</i>
<P>

<i>(d) the defendant and cross defendant's statements to be served by 15 March
1999,</i>
<P>

<i>(e) the plaintiff and cross claimants' statements in reply to be served by
12 April 1999."</i>
<P>

12   	The proceedings were at that time stood over for further
directions to 16 April 1999. 
<P>

13   	On 22 October 1998, the cross claimant filed and served an
amended cross claim. 
<P>

14   	On 12 March 1999, the defendant's solicitors wrote to the
plaintiff's then solicitors noting the significant departures from
the time
table set by the Court and advising that they were instructed that if the
plaintiff's statements were not filed and served
by 19 March 1999, they would
proceed to put on a motion to strike out the summons. They advised that, in the
alternative, if the
Court was not minded to make that order at that time, that
they would seek an order increasing the orders for security for costs
to
$150,000.  
<P>

15   	On 23 March 1999, the defendant/cross claimant filed and
served evidence in support of its cross claim.
<P>

16   	On 8 April 1999, the defendant filed and served a notice
of motion seeking to strike out the summons.
<P>

17   	On 19 April 1999, by consent, Hunter J made a number of
orders, including orders that the cross defendant file and serve its
defence to
the cross claim by 22 April and that the plaintiff/cross defendant file and
serve its statements, including expert's reports,
by 11 June 1999.
<P>

18   	On 22 April 1999, the plaintiff filed and served a defence
to the amended cross claim.
<P>

19   	On 25 June 1999 the defendant filed a motion seeking to
strike out the summons and seeking judgment on the cross claim.
<P>

20   	The notice of motion came on for hearing last week and a
number of affidavits were read. The proceedings were stood over until
this
week. The defendant has now filed an amended notice of motion on 6 July, to
which I have already referred.
<P>

21   	The proceedings concern a dispute arising out of the
construction of a residence in Terry Hills by the plaintiff for the defendant
for a contract sum of $2,778,300. The following details are taken from the
allegations in the summons. 
<P>

22   	The construction contract was entered into on 28 October
1994 and the architect certified practical completion to be 9 December
1996.
The summons further alleges that on 4 February 1997, the defendant took defect
rectification work out of the hands of the plaintiff.
On 26 February 1998, the
superintendent issued a final certificate saying that the plaintiff owed
$116,612.65 to the defendant. 
<P>

23   	By the summons the plaintiff, inter alia, asserts that the
superintendent incorrectly assessed variations and provisional
sums and
incorrectly awarded liquidated damages for delay to the defendant. The
plaintiff further claims an entitlement to prolongation.
The plaintiff claims a
total of $1,188,728.99 as at December 1997, plus interest. The summons does not
make plain how the $1,188,728.99
sum is made up. 
<P>

24   	The cross claim to which I referred, raises a liquidated
claim based on the final certificate, claims for defects and a s
52 <i>Trade
Practices Act</i> claim based on certain precontractual representations by the
plaintiff.
<P>

25   	The security for costs issue was dealt with, as I have
indicated, by the provision of personal guarantees to a $95,000 limit.
The
security for costs issue was then resolved by consent orders.
<P>

26   	It is common ground that the guarantees given are
unsecured. 
<P>

27   	By 12 March 1999, notwithstanding the directions which had
been given, the plaintiff had served neither a defence to the cross
claim nor
evidence in chief. 
<P>

28   	When, on 16 April 1999, the defendant applied to strike
out the summons, Hunter J declined that application and instead gave
the
plaintiff yet a further opportunity to prepare its case. The plaintiff was
given almost two months to prepare its evidence in
chief. 
<P>

29   	Even by the time of the hearing of this motion today,
evidence in the proceedings has not been served by the plaintiff.
<P>

30   	On 23 June 1999, the plaintiff's newly appointed
solicitors applied to have the matter relisted with a view to seeking a further
six weeks for filing evidence. 
<P>

31   	It is then the case that some fifteen months has elapsed
since the proceedings commenced; eight months since orders were first
made for
the plaintiff to file statements and over six months since the elapse of the
period first ordered for filing of evidence
by the plaintiff. Apparently after
comments were made by Hunter J about the delay in April 1999 and after the
plaintiff was given
a second opportunity to prepare its case in accordance with
the consent directions, the plaintiff has yet still to produce a single
witness's statement.
<P>

32   	The burden of the defendant's application to strike out
the summons is: -
<P>

<i>"(a) that there has been such substantial non compliance with court
directions that no order short of striking out would properly
penalise the
plaintiff,</i>
<P>

<i>(b) that the plaintiff's explanations for non compliance are feeble and
unmeritorious,</i>
<P>

<i>(c) that the plaintiff has not demonstrated that it can now prepare the
matter promptly and efficiently,</i>
<P>

<i>(d) that the plaintiff suffers no real prejudice if the matter is struck
out,</i>
<P>

<i>(e) that the defendant has suffered and will continue to suffer prejudice
from allowing the matter to meander on."</i>
<P>

33   	I accept the defendant's submission that the Construction
List like the Commercial List has been established to provide prompt
and expert
resolution of construction matters.  All matters are case managed by judges.
Practice Note 100 provides a regime for directions
to ensure the "Just quick
and cheap disposal of proceedings". I accept also that the price for this
preferential service is an obligation
to adhere to interlocutory directions:
See <i>TSF Engineering Pty Ltd v Hill</i><b> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20NSWLR%20105" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 2 NSWLR 105</a> at 110, a
`repeated example....of the oft repeated warnings against the consequences of
delay'; <i>Challenge Bank  v Raine &amp; Horne Commercial Pty Ltd</i><b>
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2017%20NSWLR%20297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 17 NSWLR 297</a> at 303;  <i>GSA Industries Pty Ltd v  N T Gas Ltd</i>

<P>

34   	I further accept the defendant's submission that the court
will, in considering the consequence of non compliance with directions,
take
into account not only the interests of the individual litigants but also the
court lists and the general desirability of efficiency
in the conduct of
litigation. (see <i>State Pollution Control Commission v Australian Iron and
Steel Pty Limited</i> (93)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=29%20NSWLR%20487" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">29 NSWLR 487</a> at 493-495 and see <i>GSA Industrial
Pty Limited v NT Gas Limited</i> (90)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=24%20NSWLR%20710" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">24 NSWLR 710</a> at 715-716.)
<P>

35   	It is necessary to examine the affidavit evidence filed by
both parties and in particular by the plaintiff to follow the plaintiff's
explanation, or several explanations for delay. Those explanations include the
following:-
<P>

<i>"(a) Mr Nolasco is inexperienced in litigation,</i>
<P>

<i> (b) Mr Nolasco was otherwise occupied,</i>
<P>

<i>(c) persons whom Mr Nolasco had sought to retain to assist him for
preparation of his case, namely, Messrs Haralambis, Wilson and
Zakos are
incompetent."</i>
<P>

36   	In his affidavit made on 30 June 1999, Mr Nolasco gives
detailed evidence of his dealings with Mr Haralambis, his lawyer at
that stage
retained. Mr Nolasco's affidavit covers a number of conversations which he had
with Mr Haralambis about the progress of
the proceedings. Mr Nolasco deposes
that by 22 April 1999 he was aware that nothing was happening in the
proceedings and had become
concerned about the conduct of the matter and the
direction of the proceedings. He felt, he deposes, that his lawyer was out of
his
depth and that he ought to get someone involved who was experienced in
building disputes. His further evidence is that in April 1999
he had dealings
with a Mr Wilson, an independent construction consultant, and sought to arrange
and did arrange to meet Mr Wilson
to use him as a consultant in this dispute.
Mr Nolasco then deposes that throughout May 1999, he contacted Mr Wilson three
or four
times a week and was generally under the impression that Mr Wilson
would, as apparently Mr Wilson informed Mr Nolasco, be closely
examining the
relevant files and drafting up statements and the like.
<P>

37   	Mr Nolasco's affidavit then includes evidence that between
April and June he spoke with Mr George Zakos to retain him as an
expert and was
told that he was finalising his report. Mr Nolasco deposes, inter alia, that on
21 June 1999, Mr Wilson said to him
that he had spoken to Mr Haralambis and
thought that the plaintiff would have to change its solicitors. Mr Wilson said
that he was
concerned that the plaintiff's retained solicitor was focusing on
the wrong issues and that as far as Mr Wilson was concerned, the
case revolved
around issues concerning administration of the contract and interference with
the subcontracts.
<P>

38   	A short summary of the affidavit of 30 June 1999 of Mr
Nolasco is that it discloses a significant delay in the moving forward
of the
plaintiff's case apparently taking place, while Mr Nolasco spoke to various
persons to assist him, including his lawyer. 
<P>

39   	There is a further parameter included in that affidavit
which is Mr Nolasco's evidence that in February 1999 he had been involved
in a
personal dispute with his brother involving Supreme Court proceedings which he
found to be distressing to the extent that he
could not focus on the dispute
with Mr Green. His evidence is that he relied totally on Mr Haralambis to guide
him, being himself,
totally inexperienced in matters of this nature.
<P>

40   	Also filed on behalf of the plaintiff on the motion was an
affidavit by Mr Wilson, a civil engineer, dealing with his initial
contact
during March 1999 with the plaintiff's representatives and the documents which
he had received from the plaintiff's lawyers
and his realising, but fairly late
in the piece, that the settling of statements of evidence from Mr Nolasco and
his personnel would
take a considerable period of time. He gives evidence that
he was not aware of the volume of documents that he had not seen or reviewed.
Mr Wilson also descends to detail in respect of his otherwise commitments
during the period of contact.
<P>

41   	There was also filed an affidavit by Mr Massey, solicitor
of Norton Smith &amp; Co., who was first retained by the plaintiff
only some
sixteen or so days ago, and deposes that he received instructions to take over
carriage of the matter from the plaintiff's
previous solicitor, Mr
Haralambis.
<P>

42   	Mr Massey deposes that since being retained he has spoken
to Mr Wilson, the consultant who had been retained to prepare evidence
for the
plaintiff and has himself commenced preparation of the plaintiff's evidence,
having received some forty two lever arch files
and two boxes of drawings and
correspondence and files both from the plaintiff and the plaintiff's previous
solicitors. Mr Massey
deposes that he has arranged to meet with particular
named witnesses and has generally completed a preliminary review of the summons
and that based on his experience, the plaintiff has reasonable prospects of
success.
<P>

43   	Also read on the hearing of the motion on behalf of the
defendant was an affidavit by the defendant's solicitor, Mr Hansen,
of 1 July
1999 in which he, inter alia, asserts that he has sighted papers in a number of
court proceedings involving the plaintiff
and Mr Nolasco which relate to
construction disputes, and there are then set out some twenty one numbered sets
of proceedings before
the Local Court of New South  Wales, the District Court
of New South Wales and the Supreme Court of New South  Wales. Additionally,
Mr
Hansen deposes that he is aware of another six sets of proceedings in the
Supreme Court and of another four sets of proceedings
in the District  Court.
In each case the proceedings number is given.
<P>

44   	From the further evidence filed it appears that Mr Massey
on 5 July 1999 had a lengthy discussion with Mr Nolasco about the
question
relating to security and, in particular, the security previously given by the
plaintiff in September 1998. Mr Massey deposes
that in the course of that
discussion the issue of certain orders made by his Honour Young J in other
proceedings was raised and
as a result, Mr Massey formed the view that it was
possible that Mr Nolasco had breached his undertaking which, I gather, was
meant
to be a reference to his undertaking to the court. 
<P>

45   	Emphasis has been placed by the defendant on the hearing
of the motion upon evidence which indicates that Mr Harry Nolasco
has indeed
breached his undertaking given to the court on 4 September 1998. That evidence
comprises a title search on the property
at 148 Glenmore Road, Paddington, of
15 June 1998, in respect of which Mr Nolasco and Ms Zaharia are the registered
proprietors.
This title search discloses that at that point in time the
property was encumbered by two mortgages, one to Permanent Custodians
Limited
and one to Desate Pty Limited and Panorama Metals Pty Limited. There is then
annexed to Mr Hansen's affidavit of 6 July 1999,
a title search on the same
property of 2 July 1999, this time recording that neither of the two previous
mortgages are shown as encumbrances
but rather that there are now three new
mortgages shown as encumbrances, one to Permanent Trustee Australia Limited,
one to Ginelle
Pty Limited and one to Richard Nolasco, whom I understand to be
the brother of Mr Harry Nolasco. 
<P>

46   	The mortgage to Mr Richard Nolasco is also in evidence
before me being dated 26 May 1999.  Annexure A to that mortgage inter
alia
states:-
<P>

<i>1.  By heads of agreement dated 1 September, 1997, the Mortgagors, amongst
others, agreed to:-</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	indemnify the mortgagee against all and any liability incurred by him as
a result of executing the registered first mortgage No.
3421092 registered on
computer folio certificate C/100463 ("the First Mortgage"), and a deed of
guarantee and indemnity limited to
$770,000 in favour of Ronald Freeman, Sharon
Freeman, P L Dyce Pty Limited and National Mutual Trustees Limited to support
advances
made by those parties to A. Nolasco Pty Limited ("the Deed")
(collectively "the Mortgagors' Indemnity").</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	inter alia, execute a second or subsequent mortgage over the property
known as 148 Glenmore Road, Paddington to secure the Mortgagors'
Indemnity.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	The mortgagors agree to pay to the mortgagee such sum as may be required
to indemnify him against any lawful demand made upon him
pursuant to the Deed,
or the First Mortgage, or either of them ("the Sum Secured").</i>
<P>

<i>3.	The mortgagors and the mortgagee agree that this mortgage will secure the
Sum Secured.</i>
<P>

47   	Plainly then the mortgage to Mr Richard Nolasco is to a
limit of $770,000 by way of an indemnity to the mortgagee against
liability
incurred to that limit in the manner described in annexure A. 
<P>

48   	As I have understood the position, there is no issue but
that no notice of these dealings was given to the defendant pursuant
to the
undertakings given to the court, nor was such notice given of any intent or
proposal to deal with the assets which it is common
ground had a value in
excess of $10,000. Indeed, certain evidence sought to be relied upon by Mr
Nolasco today includes his comment
that the property is worth $1.6 million to
$1.7 million.
<P>

49   	Mr Nolasco's further evidence in his affidavit of 8 July
1999 goes into the difficulties which he apparently was under when
in 1983 his
father became liable to pay a very large sum pursuant to a judgment of the
Federal Court. He deposes that in order that
his father not be bankrupted, he
agreed that he would both personally and through the business of the plaintiff,
ensure that his
father's debts were taken care of and that he would be able to
live comfortably for the rest of his life, together with Mr Nolasco's
mother.

<P>

50   	Mr Nolasco deposes that in order to secure some of the
borrowings necessary to settle his father's financial position it was
necessary
to encumber his mother's assets, including a particular home in which she lived
at 146 Glenmore Road.  When his mother
died in May 1996, Mr Nolasco's mother
left that property to his brother Richard. 
<P>

51   	Mr Nolasco deposes that Richard had been aware of his
father's financial difficulties and of the acts which had been necessary
to be
undertaken to resolve those matters, including the encumbering of both 146 and
148 Glenmore Road and the sale of another property
during his mother's life.
<P>

52   	Mr Nolasco deposes that he had entered into a Heads of
Agreement with his brother Richard on 1 September 1997 and those Heads
of
Agreement are before the court. Essentially those Heads of Agreement include
the plaintiff company and Mr Harry Nolasco and Ms
Maria Zaharia agreeing to
indemnify Richard against any liability incurred by him pursuant to particular
securities identified in
paragraph 1 of the Heads of Agreement to a limit of
$770,000. 
<P>

53   	Mr Nolasco's brother Richard commenced Supreme Court
proceedings in respect of the Heads of Agreement in April 1998 and apparently
Young J gave judgment in those proceedings on 21 October 1998. 
<P>

54   	Mr Nolasco deposes that pursuant to the orders of Young J,
he organised for the sale of a particular factory owned by the
plaintiff. He
deposes that the orders of Young J:-
<P>

<i>". . . effectively required me to carry out the matters in the heads of
agreement."</i>
<P>

55   	Those orders have not been tendered before the court.
<P>

56   	Further, Mr Nolasco deposes that as a result of the sale
of that factory, he was able to provide to his brother Richard $620,000
of the
$770,000 necessary to unencumber the inheritance pursuant to the Heads of
Agreement. He deposes that Richard has refused to
accept that money until such
time as he is able to provide Richard with the full $770,000 and that the
$620,000 is held in a trust
account jointly by his solicitors and Richard's
solicitors.
<P>

57   	Mr Nolasco deposes that the mortgage to his brother, to
which I have referred, being the third mortgage on the property at
148 Glenmore
Road, is effectively to secure the remaining $150,000 that he must pay his
brother. 
<P>

58   	He deposes that as a result of the judgment of Young J and
the 1997 Heads of Agreement, he needed to refinance 148 Glenmore
Road; that to
do so he discharged the loan secured by the earlier mortgages to which I have
referred and which were on the title
as at 15 June 1998; and that the effect of
the refinancing is that the previous mortgages which secured $970,000 are
replaced by
the new mortgages [which Mr Harper of counsel has informed me is
intended to refer to the two mortgages, one to Permanent Trustee
Australia
Limited and one to Ginelle Pty Limited, securing the amount of $1,040,000.]
<P>

59   	Mr Nolasco deposes that:- 
<P>

<i>"In entering into the sale of the factory and the refinancing of 148
Glenmore Road, I believed that I was carrying out all the obligations
under the
1997 Heads of Agreement and the orders of Young J. It did not occur to me that
the necessity to comply with the orders
of Young J had any impact upon my
undertaking in this matter".</i>
<P>

60   	Mr Nolasco also deposes that he has made inquiries in
respect of the obtaining of a bank guarantee such as presently is sought
on the
motion but to date has not been successful in his inquiries and deposes that,

<P>

<i>"I do not hold out much hope of obtaining such a guarantee".</i>
<P>

61   	Evidence has been given as to the expenditure of the
defendant on legal costs relating to the proceedings up to this point
of time
and as to estimates of the future expenditure requirements of the defendant.
That evidence is that up to 7 April 1999 the
defendant's costs were in the
order of $63,330. The evidence also is that up to 6 July 1999 the defendant's
costs are in the order
of $71,291. The evidence given by the defendant's
solicitor, Mr Hansen, is that his estimate of the defendant's costs up to a
concluded
hearing, which he believes will take at least ten days, is $177,757.

<P>

62   	Mr Massey does not disagree with the general estimates
given by Mr Hansen but Mr Massey does not believe the trial will last
ten days.
In short, looking at annexure `G' to Mr Hansen's 6 July 1999 affidavit, Mr
Massey's estimate would appear to require that
to be reduced by about $25,000
to let us say $150,000.
<P>

63   	Returning to the plaintiff's explanation for delay, I
accept the defendant's submission that Mr Nolasco's preoccupation with
other
proceedings is not of particular relevance to the defendant's entitlement to
have these proceedings regularly proceed. The
defendant submits that Mr Nolasco
is unable to suggest that those other proceedings occupied one hundred percent
of his time, nor
that he was the only person who could give necessary
instructions on the part of the plaintiff in those proceedings. 
<P>

64   	The defendant also makes the point that the plaintiff
consented to the 18 September 1998 and 19 April 1999 directions, no
doubt with
the full knowledge and requirements of the other proceedings. 
<P>

65   	It is submitted by the defendant, and I accept, that Mr
Haralambis' alleged incompetence being put forward by the plaintiff
as one
excuse is a matter in respect of which Mr Haralambis' evidence is not before
the court. 
<P>

66   	It is submitted, and I accept, that Mr Wilson's apparently
self confessed incompetence, is a matter for which Mr Nolasco must
bear
complete responsibility. It does seem to me that there is substance in the
defendant's submission that one wonders how anyone
involved in complex building
litigation could seriously contemplate retaining a non lawyer to draft
witness's statements. Mr Massey's
conclusion, it will be recalled, was that the
draft statement prepared by Mr Wilson "is wholly inadequate". 
<P>

67   	I accept generally the defendant's submission that up
until the time when Norton Smith was retained, the plaintiff's camp
could be
said to have been in complete disarray. No witnesses had been spoken to and the
assurances given by Mr Nolasco would have
to be discounted given what he
himself acknowledged was his inexperience, his failure to retain competent
persons by this time and
his record of non-compliance, even in the face of
direct assurances to the Court.
<P>

68   	I accept the defendant's submission that there are a
number of aspects by which the defendant suffers prejudice from the unjustified
prolongation of the proceedings. First, the defendant is an individual and the
proceedings concern his place of residence. This is
different to a commercial
dispute between two significant companies. I accept that it is unacceptable
that proceedings should hang
over an individuals head for extended periods
through no fault of his own.
<P>

69   	There is further the fact that the proceedings concern
building work which commenced almost five years ago and in which practical
completion occurred almost two and a half years ago. The time lapses between
those events and any hearing are becoming more and more
significant.
<P>

70   	Further, there is the defendant's submission of substance,
that prima facie it is the defendant rather than the plaintiff
who appears to
be owed money within the contract. (See the final certificate for the plaintiff
to pay $116,612 to the defendant.)
Further, the defendant has, as I accept,
given evidence on the motion that he has incurred costs by 24 June 1999 of over
$63,000,
increased by 6 July 1999, to $71,291.84.
<P>

71   	I turn then to the appropriate approach for the court's
discretion which requires to be exercised. There are, as Mr Harper
of counsel
for the plaintiff points out, the two applications put in the alternative in
the same motion. The first is for the summons
to be struck out and the second
is for a series of alternative orders to be made.
<P>

72   	The court is in a position in which the application for
further security for costs should be treated as a parameter of the
strike out
application so that, as it were, in the exercise of its discretion the court
might strike out the summons in the absence
of further security of a particular
type and in a particular amount being provided by a particular point in time.
The court has a
general discretion to exercise in terms of the dealing with the
motion.
<P>

73   	Insofar as the motion for security for costs is concerned,
it is pursued both pursuant to the provisions to be found in Part
53 of the
Supreme Court Rules and in terms of s 1335 of the Corporations Law.
<P>

74   	The defendant's contention is that if the court is minded
to grant to the plaintiff an indulgence of extending the time for
preparing its
case, a condition of doing so ought be that the defendant receive proper
security for its costs. The defendant's submission
is that the plaintiff
apparently resists the order to provide security by way of a bank guarantee on
the grounds more generally applicable
in applications for security under s
1335, namely:- 
<P>

		(a) That its impecuniosity was caused by the defendant.
<P>

		(b) That Mr Nolasco does not have the resources to do so.
<P>

75   	Mr Nolasco asserts that it is the defendant who is
responsible for his 1997 balance sheet showing a deficiency of assets over
liabilities. Mr Nolasco suggests that the defendant has failed to pay over one
million dollars due under the contract. The defendant
disputes that claim and,
in turn, claims that the final certificate shows that the defendant is owed by
the plaintiff, $116,000.
<P>

76   	I accept the defendant's submission that there is a real
relevance that the alleged losses are "of a promissory kind rather
than
`reliance' damages" - see <i>FAI - Sel Pty Ltd v Brambles Holdings Ltd v.
Elizabeth Holdings </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%203%20ACLC%20312" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 3 ACLC 312</a> at 315.
<P>

77   	Although Mr Nolasco asserts that the plaintiff incurred
costs as a result of the defendant's conduct, he has not, I accept,
identified
nor quantified those costs. The summons, I accept, acknowledges that the
plaintiff has received over $1.9 million from
the defendant. I accept that
without some concrete evidence that the plaintiff has incurred costs
substantially in excess of that
amount in carrying out the works, it is
difficult for the court to accept the plaintiff's said assertion. 
<P>

78   	The defendant has, in written submissions, submitted that
in any event a brief analysis of the 1997 accounts shows that during
the
1996/97 year the plaintiff disbursed approximately $703,000 by movements in the
loan against other related parties. The particulars
given in those submissions
which appear from the documents are:-

<P>

79   	I accept the defendant's submission that during the
1996/97 year the plaintiff's position has substantially deteriorated due
to
payments which ex facie, appear to have had nothing to do with the Green
contract. 
<P>

80   	I further accept the defendant's submission that Mr
Nolasco's strongly held optimism of June 1998 that the plaintiff would,
by
September 1998, have remedied its negative assets position so as to be able to
meet the cost estimates of the proceedings then
in place, was apparently
misplaced.  The plaintiff has not produced any evidence of its financial
position as at 30 June 1997 and,
in fact, it has ceased trading.
<P>

81   	Also of relevance on this topic is the fact that the
defendant serve the plaintiff with a notice to produce returnable this
morning,
requiring production inter alia of the accounts of the plaintiff for the
financial years 1997/1998 and 1998/1999. The notice
to produce was called. The
documents were not produced. The principal objection appeared to be relevance.
The notice to produce has
been marked as exhibit A2 on the application.  To my
mind the court is entitled to infer from the failure to produce those documents
and from the evidence given on affidavit and by Mr Nolasco in cross
examination, that the plaintiff's financial position is one of
particular
difficulty and possibly that is the reason why no such evidence of its current
financial position has been produced.
<P>

82   	Mr Kerr has submitted on behalf of the defendant that on
an application for security under Corporations Law s 1335 where those
standing
behind the company claim impecuniosity, they must prove that they are without
means. (See <i>Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corp</i><b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1984/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] FCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%202%20FCR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 2
FCR 1).</a>  Further that if they are willing to expose themselves to the risk of
costs, the court may take that into account. (See <i>K P Cable Investments Pty
Ltd v Meltglow Pty Ltd</i><b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1995/76.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] FCA 76</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2013%20ACLC%20437" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 13 ACLC 437</a> at 440, 444-445 - see
generally in terms of the appropriate principles to be dealt with on a security
for costs application <i>De Safo Pty Limited v South Sydney Leagues Club</i>,
(Unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 22 May 1998, Einstein J.)
<P>

83   	Of the two persons dealt with in the affidavits both of
whom gave security, Mr Nolasco who owns all the shares beneficially
and Ms
Zaharia (to whom loan monies are owed), neither has given evidence of their
personal financial position, other than Mr Nolasco's
statement provided over a
year ago that he does not have sufficient assets to provide security. Neither
has set out even a basic
statement of their assets and liabilities, when it is
clear from the plaintiff's accounts that each owns shares in a number of other
companies and that each is owed money by the plaintiff.
<P>

84   	During the course of the argument on the motion, Mr Harper
obtained instructions that Mr Nolasco and Ms Zaharia would be prepared
to
increase the current security from $95,000 to $150,000. 
<P>

85   	The plaintiff, as I have said, has adduced no evidence of
its current financial position. Given that it has ceased trading,
it seems to
be a reasonable inference that other creditors stand to benefit from this
litigation, yet those creditors are not identified,
nor is there any evidence
that they have been approached to provide security.
<P>

86   	A very important factor, to my mind, to be taken into
account in terms of the courts determination of the motion, is the breaches
of
undertaking given to the court. That has already been referred to. In fact, not
only was the 26 May 1999 mortgage over the property
at 148 Glenmore Road
executed without notice, but the two additional mortgages to which I have
referred over the same property, took
the total amount secured from $970,000 to
$1,190,000. 
<P>

87   	In short, if one accepts, and I have considerable doubt
that this is the correct approach, but if one accepts that the monies
now held
in the trust account should be taken into account, there is quite plainly, on
Mr Nolasco's own evidence, now secured over
the property at 148 Glenmore Road,
an amount of $1,190,000. 
<P>

88   	Mr Nolasco has deposed to the value of that property in
glowing terms. He has annexed a valuation of the property said to
be
$1,350,000. He himself believes it to be worth $1.6 million to $1.7 million.

<P>

89   	<i>M A Productions v Austarama Television Pty Ltd &amp;
Anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%207%20ACLR%2097" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 7 ACLR 97</a> at 100 sets out the view of Needham J, which I
follow, that there is no predisposition to fetter the exercise of the court by
its
jurisdiction. The correct principle is that the discretion is untrammelled
by any preconceived opinions and that the court should
exercise a discretion in
relation to security for costs applications, taking account of all relevant
factors. Those factors Needham
J held at page 100, include:-
<P>

90   	1.	The Court can consider the strength and bona fides of
the plaintiff's case.
<P>

	2.	The Court can consider whether the defendant's application for security is
oppressive in the sense that it is being used merely
to deny an impecunious
<P>

		plaintiff a right to litigate.
<P>

	3.	The Court can consider whether the want of assets experienced by the
plaintiff is caused by the default of the defendants.
<P>

	4.	The Court can consider whether the order, if made, would stultify the
plaintiff's action, and it is not bound in such an application
to accept the
<P>

		estimate by the defendant of the costs of the proceedings.
<P>

91   	This is not, of course, an application which is simply to
be regarded as an application for security for costs. It is an application
to
strike out and, in the alternative, an application for security for costs and
for other orders. 
<P>

92   	There is a substantial body of principle, the gravamen of
which identifies the generally extreme reluctance of a court to
strike out a
summons on the ground of want of prosecution. Peremptory relief in the form of
a strike out application may be granted
but is usually granted in exceptional
cases and only where the application to strike out is very clearly made out on
the evidence.
<P>

93   	To my mind the defendant on the present application has
made good the proposition that there has been a totally unsatisfactory
attendance by the plaintiff to its obligations in terms of prosecuting the
proceedings. The fact that the plaintiff has now, at the
last moment,
apparently retained yet a further firm of solicitors, one certainly hopes will
augur well for the future prosecution
of the proceedings and for no further
recurrence of the plaintiff's conduct to this point in time. 
<P>

94   	Further, the blatant disregard of the Court's directions
in the circumstances of the evidence before the Court today, when
taken into
account with the breaches of the undertaking to the Court forming part of the
security for costs now in place, are factors
which, to my mind, require the
Court to be particularly careful in formulating the orders now made so as to
ensure that not only
is the plaintiff given a reasonable opportunity to put
forward its further submissions on costs and to have its day in Court, but
also
to ensure in a realistic and practicable fashion, that the defendant is no
longer exposed to what appears to have been a disastrous,
to date, attempt by
the plaintiff to prosecute the proceedings.
<P>

95   	In all of those circumstances I am disposed not to make
Order 2 in the summons but to make orders which are seen as, in effect,
a
conditional striking out or, alternatively, as in effect, orders within the
Court's discretion, in terms of the application for
security. Those orders
will, to my mind, properly secure to the defendant an assurance that the
plaintiff will move and will move
expeditiously to file its further evidence.
Hence, the orders which I propose to make will include a guillotine order that
the proceedings
stand dismissed in certain circumstances.
<P>

96   	I do not accept Mr Harper's submission that the Court
should simply permit, in an unsecured form, the security by way of personal
guarantee by Mr Nolasco and Ms Zaharia to be increased to $150,000.
<P>

97   	A question was raised as to whether the Court's order 2
made on Friday last was to be in substitution of the existing security
regime
provided pursuant to orders made by the Court on 4 September 1998 whereunder Mr
Nolasco and Ms Zaharia, in separate deeds
and by separate undertakings to the
Court as guarantors, each promised the defendant:
<P>

<i>`That if the plaintiff does not pay to the defendant all costs which the
plaintiff may have been ordered to pay to the defendant in
the above
proceedings, the guarantor will pay to the defendant whatever is required to
make good the plaintiff's default to a limit
of $95,000.'</i>
<P>

98   	To my mind, the question of the continuance of the
existing security regime in the light of order 2 made on Friday, does require
fairly close examination.
<P>

99   	It will be recalled that at the end of the hearing, the
defendant's costs are likely to be in a range between $221,000 and
$248,000
depending as the evidence of the defendant's solicitor or plaintiff's solicitor
as to expected length of hearing period,
prove correct.
<P>

100   	The orders made on Friday last, 9 July, plainly require
the plaintiff to provide further and altered security to that presently
in
place and provided pursuant to the Court's orders of 4 September 1998.
<P>

101   	If order 2 of the orders made on 9 July 1999 is complied
with in terms, then the level of security provided by the plaintiff
to be in
place within five days after the date when the proceedings receive a final date
fixture, will be in the sum of $120,000
provided by bank guarantee.
<P>

102   	If either or both of the $80,000 and/or $40,000 bank
guarantees the subject of order 2 made on 9 July 1999 are not provided,
the
defendant by order 4 of the orders of 9 July 1999 will be entitled to its costs
on an indemnity basis.
<P>

103   	If the $80,000 bank guarantee is not paid, the only
security which will then be in place to secure the plaintiff's obligation
to
pay indemnity costs will comprise the existing guarantees by Mr Nolasco and Ms
Zaharia.
<P>

104   	If the first bank guarantee for $80,000 is paid and the
remaining $40,000 bank guarantee is not provided, the securities
which will be
in place to secure the plaintiff's obligation to pay indemnity costs will be
:
<P>

	(a)	The $80,000 first bank guarantee;
<P>

	(b)	The existing guarantees by Mr Nolasco and Ms Zaharia.
<P>

105   	The costs of the defendant on an indemnity basis up to a
point in time being five days after the date when the proceedings
receive a
final hearing date fixture, are not estimated with any precision in the
existing affidavits.  They would, however, clearly
be less than the $221,000 -
$248,000 estimate for completion of a final hearing.  They are likely to be
well in excess both of the
present costs of $71,291, and of the $80,000 amount
which would by then have been secured by the provision of bank guarantee.  This
is because by a point in time which is five days after the date when the
proceedings receive a final hearing date fixture, the defendant's
costs would
include costs of the preparation of all evidence in answer - see the terms of
order 1 of the orders made on 9 July 1999.
<P>

106   	In order to cover the defendant's costs on an assumed
indemnity basis up to the point in time which is five days after the
date when
the proceedings receive a final hearing date fixture, it seems to me
appropriate that the existing regime for security,
including the guarantees
provided by Mr Nolasco and Ms Zaharia, remain in place, but also that the
defendant, Mr Nolasco and Ms Zoharia,
if and only if both bank guarantees of
$80,000 and $40,000 are provided as ordered by the due date, be granted leave
to revisit the
question of the continuance of the existing regime.  For one
thing, once both those bank guarantees have been provided, then the
likelihood
that the defendant will be entitled to indemnity costs falls dramatically.
<P>

107   	To my mind, it is appropriate to add a further order to
the orders made on 9 July 1999 to permit the question of the continuance
of the
existing guarantees provided by Mr Nolasco and Ms Zaharia to be revisited,
should the two bank guarantees have been provided.
<P>

108   	I therefore add the following order:
<P>

<i>`Order that upon the due compliance by the plaintiff with order 2 of the
Court's orders made on 9 July 1999, the plaintiff, Mr Nolasco
and Ms Zaharia
have leave to approach the Court as they may be advised to have varied or
discharged order 1 of the orders made on
4 September 1998 and/or to have orders
made permitting a variation of the deeds of guarantee so as to reduce the
amounts now included
in those Deeds of Guarantee.'</i>
<P>
