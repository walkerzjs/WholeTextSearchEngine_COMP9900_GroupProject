WEDNESDAY 23  JUNE 1999
<P>

<b>4373/98	LANCEDALE HOLDINGS PTY LIMITED &amp; ANOR  v  HEATH GROUP
AUSTRALASIA PTY LIMITED &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>These proceedings relate to a parcel of
316,579 ordinary shares of 50 cents each in the capital of Heath Fielding
Australia Pty Limited.
 The first defendant's name formerly was Heath Fielding
Australia Pty Limited; it has been renamed Heath Group Australasia Pty Limited,
but I use its former name.  The second defendant is Heath Nominees Ltd.
<P>

2  	The plaintiffs allege that the beneficial owner is the second
plaintiff Mrs Wendy Langley.  The defendants' position is that
the shares had
no economic value, and that they have now been cancelled.  The plaintiffs do
not accept that they had no value.  In
the words of Mr Andrew Clive Langley in
his evidence:
<P>

<i>"....One day the shares may be worth something." </i>
<P>

3  	During negotiations the defendants' solicitors showed the
plaintiffs' solicitors a "<i>Pro-Forma Summary of the unaudited accounts</i>"
for the period ending 31 December 1997, which showed net assets at $6, 478,153,
and this appears to have influenced the plaintiffs'
view of what is involved in
the proceedings.  There is no basis on which I could make a finding about the
value of the shares, except
to say that they may have significant economic
value.
<P>

4  	In the Amended Summons the plaintiffs seek seven declarations
establishing various propositions relating to dealings in the
shares; and also
seek orders giving effect to their propositions.  The first defendant
cross-claims for a debt which it says is payable
in respect of the loan to
acquire the shares.
<P>

5  	At some date in 1992 Mr A.C. Langley, who is an Insurance Broker,
commenced employment with Heath Fielding Australia in a senior
executive
position.  By a letter of 11 January 1993 Heath Fielding Australia invited Mr
A.C. Langley to participate in the Executive
Share Plan which the company
conducted.  The company by a letter of 11 January 1993 sent him documentation,
including a document
of nine pages headed <i>"Rules of the Heath Fielding
Executive Share Plan."</i>  I call these the Plan Rules.  The letter set out
some additional rules, one requiring confidentiality and one requiring Mr
Langley
to enter into a Contract of Service.  Mr A.C. Langley acted on this
invitation by applying for shares to be issued to Lancedale Holdings
Pty
Limited, the first plaintiff, a private company effectively owned at all
relevant times by himself, and a Family Company within
the meaning of the Plan
Rules.  In the application for shares he agreed to an issue price of
$122,368.44 payable in full on issue
of the Plan Shares and requested Heath
Fielding Australia to lend him the aggregate issue price to enable him to
finance acquisition
of the Plan Shares.  He acknowledged that the Plan Shares
would be issued pursuant to the Plan Rules and that they would be registered
in
the name of Heath Nominees and held in trust for himself.  (This must be
understood to mean in trust for Lancedale Holdings).
 Mr A.C. Langley agreed to
be bound by and to comply with the Plan Rules and the Memorandum and Articles
of Heath Fielding Australia.
 
<P>

6  	Mr A.C. Langley completed a Loan Agreement in his own name for
Heath Fielding Australia to lend him $122,368.44.  Clause 3 limited
the amount
repayable:
<P>

<i>"3.  REPAYMENT</i>
<P>

<i>3.1	Subject to the provisions of clause 3.2. the Principal Sum is repayable
by the Executive -</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	in full, upon disposal by the Executive of all his Plan Shares;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	in part, upon disposal by the Executive of some only of his Plan Shares,
the partial repayment to bear the same proportion to
the Principal Sum as the
number of Plan Shares disposed of bears to the total number of Plan Shares held
by the Executive immediately
prior to the disposal.</i>
<P>

<i>3.2	If the Sale Price of any Plan Shares is less than the Issue Price, the
Executive's liability to repay the Principal Sum shall
be reduced by the
aggregate difference between the Issue Price and the Sale Price of those Plan
Shares."</i>
<P>

7  	Heath Nominees made a Declaration of Trust which established that
the shares were held in trust for Lancedale Holdings.  A written
Contract of
Service was executed.  It bore date 1 January 1993 but was probably executed a
little later that month.  In January 1993
or soon afterwards the shares were
issued to Heath Nominees.  The evidence does not show the exact date on which
the shares were
issued to Heath Nominees, as the parties left significant
documents undated and did not supply this information by evidence, but
this
probably happened in January 1993.  Heath Nominees remained the registered
holder of the shares until they were cancelled on
27 May 1998.  By January 1998
or thereabouts the shares were Eligible Shares within the meaning of the Plan
Rules; this was so because
by then they had been held by Lancedale Holdings for
more than five years.
<P>

8  	The arrangements for loan finance for acquisition of the shares
were contemplated by the Plan Rules.  So too was the holding
of shares by a
Family Company and not by the Executive.
<P>

9  	Mr A.C. Langley's employment ceased on 7 August 1995, and
thereafter until the events of 1998 which I will set out no steps
were taken to
alter the beneficial ownership of the shares.
<P>

10  	Rule 6 of the Plan Rules dealt with disposal of Plan Shares
during employment and provided machinery, under which Heath Fielding
Australia
was able to buy back or arrange for the sale of Eligible Shares but was not
obliged to do so.  Rule 6 related only to Eligible
Shares, and the shares in
dispute were not Eligible Shares during Mr A.C. Langley's employment.
Otherwise Rule 6 forbad disposition
of Family Company shares during
employment.
<P>

11  	Rule 7  "Disposal of Plan Shares after termination of
employment" is of high importance:
<P>

<i>"7.	DISPOSAL OF PLAN SHARES AFTER TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT</i>
<P>

<i>7.1	The Company shall for a period of 60 days ("the Buy-Out Period") from
the Termination Date in respect of an Executive or Family
Company (as the case
may be) have the right (but not the obligation) to purchase or to arrange for
another person to purchase all
(but not only some) of the Plan Shares of that
Executive or Family Company (as the case may be), in accordance with the
following
provisions.</i>
<P>

<i>7.2	The right referred to in Rule 7.1 must be exercised by notice in writing
("Exercise Notice") served on the Executive or the Designated
Executive (as the
case may be) before expiry of the Buy-Out Period.</i>
<P>

<i>7.3	Subject to the provisions of Rule 7.4 the purchase price for the Plan
Shares shall be:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	in respect of those Plan Shares which were Eligible Shares on the
Termination Date, the higher of the Fair Value and the Issue
Price;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	in respect of those Plan Shares which were Ineligible Shares on the
Termination Date, the Issue Price.</i>
<P>

<i>7.4	In the case of:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	termination of the Executive or Designated Executive's services due to
death, permanent disability, retirement (with the approval
of the Committee) or
retrenchment, all of the relevant Plan Shares shall be deemed to be Eligible
Shares;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the lawful summary dismissal of the Executive or Designated Executive,
all of the relevant Plan Shares shall be deemed to be Ineligible
Shares.</i>
<P>

<i>7.5	The holder of the relevant Plan Shares shall in return for the price to
be paid for the Plan Shares, tender to the Company -</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the share scrip in relation to the Plan Shares;  and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	a duly executed transfer form in respect of the Plan Shares</i>
<P>

<i>failing which the Company may cause the Plan Shares to be transferred to the
Company (or other person referred to in Rule 7.1) and
shall hold the price to
be paid for those shares in trust for the former holder.</i>
<P>

<i>7.6	If the Company does not exercise its right under Rule 7.1 then, subject
to the Articles of Association of the Company, the Executive
or Family Company
(as the case may be) may after expiry of the Buy-Out Period dispose of his or
its Plan Shares to any third party."</i>
<P>

12  	Heath Fielding Australia took no action under Rule 7.1 within 60
days after Mr A.C. Langley's employment ended, and took no
action of the kind
indicated until 1998.
<P>

13  	Rule 8 dealt with repayment of loans, but only operated unless
otherwise agreed, and that subject was dealt with in Mr Langley's
Loan
Agreement.
<P>

14  	Rule 13.1(d) "<i>Powers and Procedures of the Committee"</i> is
also of importance:
<P>

<i>13.	POWERS AND PROCEDURES OF THE COMMITTEE</i>
<P>

<i>13.1	The Plan shall be administered by the Committee which shall have power
to:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	determine appropriate procedures for administration of the Plan
consistent with the Rules;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	resolve conclusively all questions of fact or interpretation arising in
connection with the Plan or these Rules;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	delegate to any one or more persons for such period and on such
conditions as they may determine the exercise of their powers
or discretions
under these Rules; and</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	alter, modify, add to or repeal the Rules (even where such alteration,
modification, addition or repeal might adversely affect
existing rights or
otherwise disadvantage an existing Plan participant).</i>
<P>

<i>13.2	The Committee shall endeavour to reach decisions by consensus.
However, if a consensus cannot be achieved, decisions shall be
made by majority
vote."</i>
<P>

15  	Rule 16  -  <i>"Application of Rules" </i>provided:
<P>

<i>"16.	APPLICATION OF RULES</i>
<P>

<i>16.1	Subject to the provisions of Rule 16.2, these Rules cease to apply to
Plan Shares when those Plan Shares are validly transferred
away from the holder
in accordance with these Rules.</i>
<P>

<i>16.2	These Rules continue to apply if the transferee of the Plan Shares is
also an Executive or a Family Company."</i>
<P>

16  	For over two years after Mr A.C. Langley left Heath Fielding
Australia's employment the shareholding was at a stand.  By 1998
Mr A.C.
Langley was working in a competing business.  Heath Fielding Australia reported
losses, there were no dividends and there
was no action relating to the shares
and involving Lancedale Holdings of which evidence speaks.  In January 1998
Lancedale Holdings
took some action which the evidence does not describe, and
this led to a meeting between representatives of the parties on 12 February
1998.  The meeting was followed by correspondence in which solicitors
representing Lancedale Holdings recorded that Heath Fielding
Australia was to
give consideration to the price, if any, it was prepared to offer to purchase
the shares, asked for financial information
and called for the shares to be
transferred to Lancedale Holdings.  This call was not complied with.  
<P>

17  	On 19 February Heath Fielding Australia through its solicitors
stated that it was interested in acquiring the shares by way
of Buy-back
....<i>as the policy of the controlling shareholder ....is that the only other
persons who should hold HFA's shares are executives working
for HFA".
</i>After putting some considerations affecting the value of the shares and
suggesting that the fair market value was nominal, Heath Fielding
Australia
offered to buy back the shares for $122,368.44, which it was said would have
been the price if the Buy-back arrangements
under the Share Plan applied.  In
this offer the payment of the Buy-back Price was to be satisfied by
extinguishing the loan, and
any Buy-back Agreement was to be conditional on
approval by shareholders pursuant to s. 206E of the Corporations Law.  The Pro
Forma
Summary of the unaudited accounts for the period ending 31 December 1997
was furnished in support of this offer.  
<P>

18  	The attractiveness to Lancedale Holdings of the proposed
extinguishment of the loan is qualified by the terms on which the
loan was
repayable; it was not repayable unless the shares were disposed of, and in that
case liability to pay was reduced, in effect
to the sale price. 
<P>

19  	The reason offered for not complying with the call to transfer
the registered ownership of shares to Lancedale Holdings was
that the Committee
of the Share Plan required that all Plan Shares be held by Heath Nominees; this
appears to reflect Rule 5.5 of
the Plan Rules:
<P>

<i>"5.	ACCEPTANCES</i>
<P>

<i>5.5	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these Rules, the
Committee may require any Plan Shares issued pursuant to
these Rules to be
issued to and registered and held in the name of a nominee company specified by
the Company."</i>
<P>

20  	On 25 February 1998 the Share Plan Committee resolved to modify
the Share Plan in a number of ways pursuant to the power in
Rule 13.1(d).  On
the face of things these amendments had a radical effect.  One amendment
deleted "<i>for a period of sixty days" </i>in Rule 7.1 and substituted "<i>at
any time"; </i>this had the effect of extending the Buy-out Period permanently.
Associated with this extension was Substituted Rule 7.6:
<P>

<i>"7.6	If the Company has not after the Termination Date sought to exercise
its rights under Rule 7.1 the Executive or Family Company
which holds the Plan
Shares otherwise the subject of Rule 7.1 may by notice in writing served on the
Company before the expiry of
the Buy-Out Period require the Company to offer to
acquire all of the Executive's or Family Company's (as the case may be) Plan
Shares
on the terms of Rules 7.3, 7.4 and 7.5".</i>
<P>

21  	The reference in Substituted Rule 7.6 to giving notice
"<i>before the expiry of the Buy-out Period" </i>has a ridiculous aspect, as
the Buy-out Period became permanent with the amendment to Rule 7.1.   
<P>

22  	New Rule 7.7 was added in these terms:
<P>

<i>"If the Company does not comply with its obligations under Rule 7.6 and
buyback the Executive or Family Company's Plan Shares within
90 days of
receiving the notice referred to in Rule 7.6, then subject to the Articles of
Association of the Company the Executive
or Family Company (as the case may be)
may dispose of his or its Plan Shares to any third party permitted by the
Committee in its
absolute discretion and subject to such terms and conditions
as the Committee may see fit.  The Committee shall not be required to
give any
reasons for withholding approval to a proposed sale of Plan Shares to any
transferee."</i>
<P>

23  	One effect of the interaction of New Rule 7.7 with the other
Rules as amended is that the Executive or the Family Company would
never obtain
an unqualified entitlement to dispose of its shares; the position would
permanently be at the discretion of the Committee.
 This is a sharp contrast to
the previous situation in which, if Heath Fielding Australia did not accept the
shares and pay the price
in a transfer tendered by the Executive or Family
Company, the Executive or Family Company became entitled to dispose of the Plan
Shares to a third party.  That entitlement was subject to restrictions on
transfer in the Articles, and in turn the restrictions
were subject to the
powers of the Court under s. 1094 of the Corporations Law.
<P>

24  	Heath Fielding Australia's offer of 19 February 1998 made any
Buy-back Agreement conditional on approval by its shareholders
pursuant to s
206E of the Corporations Law; it would seem that this condition was imposed
because the shares would be cancelled.
 However approval by Heath Fielding
Australia's directors or shareholders, under s 206E or otherwise, was not made
a condition of
the effectiveness of the alterations of the Plan Rules by the
terms of the Share Plan Committee's resolution, and  the Plan Rules
impose no
such condition on an alteration under Rule 13.1(d).  
<P>

25  	On 25 March 1998 Heath Fielding Australia, in a notice directed
to Mr Langley and not to Lancedale Holdings, gave Mr Langley
a purported notice
of an Extraordinary General Meeting of Heath Fielding Australia to be held on
Friday 17 April 1998, and an Explanatory
Memorandum. Heath Fielding Australia
told Mr Langley that Heath Fielding Australia had been instructed to issue the
notice to all
shareholders on behalf of Heath Nominees.  In other
correspondence the position had been put that Heath Fielding Australia was not
obliged to give notices of company meetings to beneficial owners of shares, but
only to Heath Nominees.  The beneficial owners were
not on the share register
and had no right as against Heath Fielding Australia to receive notices or
attend meetings.  The discharge
of trustee responsibilities to beneficial
owners was a concern of Heath Nominees.  Mr A.C. Langley was also given a Form
of Direction
to Heath Nominees Limited in the nature of a proxy.  The
resolution proposed was that the amendments made by the Plan Committee on
25
February be approved.  The Explanatory Memorandum did not explain the need for
approval.
<P>

26  	On 7 April 1998 Lancedale Holdings sold the shares to the second
plaintiff Mrs Wendy Langley, who is the wife of Mr A.C. Langley,
for $100.  The
sale was effected by an Agreement under seal, and I regard the sale as an
effectual equitable assignment of the beneficial
ownership of the shares for
value.  However this conclusion is subject to the question of the operation of
the alteration of Rule
7.1 which was made on 25 February 1998, with which I
deal elsewhere.
<P>

27  	On 15 April 1998 solicitors representing Lancedale Holdings and
Mr A.C. Langley wrote to Heath Fielding Australia disputing
that the amendments
had effect or would have effect if approved, on the ground that after expiry of
the Buy-Out Period the power
of alteration could not be exercised to take away
acquired rights; and further grounds were put forward.  The same letter gave
notice
of the assignment of the shares, contended that the consideration of
$100 was payable by Lancedale Developments to Heath Fielding
Australia in
accordance with the Loan Agreement and forwarded a cheque for that sum.  The
letter referred to the call which had been
made to Heath Nominees for the share
certificate and transfer, and indicated that when available these would be
delivered for registration
of a transfer to Mrs Wendy Langley.  Notice was also
directed to Heath Nominees.
<P>

28  	On 19 May 1998, in a letter to Mr A.C. Langley care of Lancedale
Holdings, Heath Fielding Australia gave a Buy-back Notice
under Rule 7.1 in its
new form at a price of $122,368.44; the notice said that the price was to be
retained by Heath Fielding Australia,
and that this would extinguish the loan.
Heath Fielding Australia asked that Lancedale Holdings give a direction to
Heath Nominees
to transfer the shares to Heath Fielding Australia.  Lancedale
Holdings did not comply, and on 27 May 1998, Heath Fielding Australia
wrote
stating that it had exercised its power under Rule 7.5 and had caused the
shares to be transferred to Heath Fielding Australia.
 The letter stated that
the transfer had been approved by the Board on 27 May 1998, that the transfer
had been registered, that pursuant
to s 206I(3) of the Corporations Law the
shares had been cancelled; and also said that the loan had been extinguished.
The Transfer,
Minutes and other documents which purport to carry out these
transactions are in evidence.
<P>

29  	Claim 1 in the Amended Summons claims a declaration which would
establish that the plaintiffs are unaffected by these events
because the Plan
Rules in their first form were incorporated in a contract between Lancedale
Holdings and Heath Fielding Australia.
 The contention is that there is no
power to vary them so as to affect that contract.
<P>

30  	Claim 2 claims a declaration that the purported acquisition of
27 May 1998 was of no effect.  Claim 3 makes a similar claim
about the
purported cancellation of the shares.  Claim 4 claims rectification of the
Register under statutory powers.
<P>

31  	Claim 5 claims a declaration establishing the effectiveness of
the transfer of the beneficial ownership to Mrs Wendy Langley.
 Claim 6 claims
an entitlement to discharge the loan on payment of $100.  Claims 7, 8 and 9 are
supplemental to these.  Claim 10
claims damages arising out of the
cancellation, alternatively to Claims 2, 3 and 4.
<P>

32  	As a matter of language, the defendants are in a strong position
because of the apparent breadth of the language in which the
power of
alteration is conferred by Rule 13.1(d).  The defendants' position is also
aided by the incorporation of the Plan Rules
in the contract arising from the
Application for issue for shares made by Lancedale Holdings to Heath Fielding
Australia followed
by their issue.  Paragraph 4 of the Application acknowledged
"...that the Plan Shares will be issued pursuant to the Rules of the
Heath
Fielding Executive Share Plan (the Plan Rules) " and an acknowledgment "...that
he has read and understands the Plan Rules...".
 (The acknowledgment went on to
say that the applicant "....understands that on his departure from the company
the company will have
the right, but will not be obliged, to buy-back his Plan
Shares."  The reference was to the rights arising on his departure, and
not
permanently.)  Argument at the hearing related principally to the effect of
Rule 13.1(d) and whether it should be interpreted
in this simple way.
<P>

33  	The operation of the Plan Rules is contractual; they have force
because they are incorporated in the contractual relationship
between a
particular Executive or Family Company and Heath Fielding Australia.  They do
not operate in the way in which Articles
of Association operate, and they are
not subject to statutory powers of amendment.
<P>

34  	Lancedale Holdings' property right was a beneficial interest in
shares, and had its origin in the contract between Heath Fielding
Australia and
Lancedale Holdings which incorporated the Plan Rules and empowered action under
Rule 13.1(d).  To speak of Lancedale
Holdings' interest as beneficial ownership
of the shares is an abbreviation, accurate for most purposes, but not a
complete statement
of what Lancedale Holdings' interest in the shares was.  A
full definition of its equitable interest would refer to the whole scheme
of
the contractual relationship including the power of alteration and the
restrictions on the right to transfer.  
<P>

35  	Plaintiffs' counsel contended that Rule 13.1(d) gave the
Committee power to amend the general machinery of the Share Plan available
from
time to time for the Executive or the Family Company to take advantage of, but
did not enable the Committee to modify the Rules
so far as they had become part
of a particular contract with an Executive or a Family Company.  On this
reading, the Share Plan is
a standard set of provisions under which an Employee
Share Acquisition Scheme Program is conducted, and those provisions may be
altered,
but they may only be altered up to the time when the Plan becomes part
of the contractual relationship between Heath Fielding Australia
and a
particular Executive or Family Company.
<P>

36  	The plaintiffs' counsel contended that the Committee was not at
liberty to alter a contractual relationship retrospectively,
that is to say was
not able to alter some entitlement which had already come into existence, by an
alteration made after it came
into existence.  Counsel pointed to the events
which made the Share Plan one of the advantages accorded to Mr A.C. Langley by
reason
of his employment.  After he had been in the employment for a period he
had been given a fresh contract of which the Share Plan was
part, and continued
to serve for over two years until August 1995; before 1998 he had conferred
every advantage on Heath Fielding
Australia which he was obliged to confer and
had no further obligation which he had not discharged, yet Heath Fielding
Australia
still had outstanding obligations and relationships of benefit to
him, and it was these that the Committee chose to alter.  
<P>

37  	Counsel characterised the amendment as a retrospective
deprivation of an accrued right to sell to a third party, and of an
accrued
right to beneficial ownership of the shares.  
<P>

38  	Where a power is conferred by a contract in language which
literally appears to authorise one party to defeat contractual entitlements
after they have accrued to another party, the construction of the contract
should be approached with some care.  I have in view the
principle referred by
McHugh and Gummow JJ in <b>Bailey v New South Wales Medical Defence Union
Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20184%20CLR%20399" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 184 CLR 399</a> at 430 in these terms:
<P>

<i>"In the present case, the substance of the contract was to confer upon Dr
Bailey, in the events that had allegedly happened during
his treatment of Mr
Crawford, an entitlement to indemnity in respect of the claim which might later
be made upon him.  In that sense,
Dr Bailey acquired vested or accrued rights
or interests.  Consistently with general principle, a power which might be
construed
so as to curtail or abrogate what otherwise would be rights or
interest in favour of one party to the contract is construed as operating
prospectively ."</i>
<P>

39  	At Note 75 their Honours referred to <b>Swabey v Port Darwin
Gold Mining Co. </b>(1889) 1 Meg<b> </b>385 and to five other illustrations of
the principle, three being decisions of the High Court itself.  The
illustrations to which
their Honours referred show, with varying degrees of
force, the general approach of Courts; they show a general approach to
construction,
and do not show any special legal doctrine relating to the
construction of contracts.  The discussion to which their Honours referred
in
<b>Victrawl Pty Limited v Telstra Corporation Limited </b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/51.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20183%20CLR%20595" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 183 CLR 595</a>
at 620-621 relates to amending statutes, but exemplifies the general
principle.
<P>

40  	Rule 13.1(d) may well have been drafted with this principle
under consideration, as its parenthesis appears to displace the
principle.
<P>

41  	Counsel pointed to some anomalies which could arise from
conceivable amendments to other clauses of the Plan.  It was said
to be an
anomaly that an amendment could extend the period of twelve months following
the termination date during which competition
was restrained under Rule 11.
During argument I raised the possibility of an alteration regulating some
subject with which the Plan
Rules do not deal at all; my example of a Rule
prescribing where the employee is to live was an extreme one, but less extreme
examples
could readily be devised.
<P>

42  	Plaintiffs' counsel then contended that if the power of
alteration had the breadth contended for by the defendants it would
render the
contract illusory; it would not be a contract at all because of the amplitude
of the Committee's power over it.  The argument
proceeded on the assumption,
not expressly articulated, that the Committee and Heath Fielding Australia are
in substance the same
thing.  In the Share Plan the definition of Committee
establishes that the Committee comprises the managing director and two nominees
of Heath Fielding Australia, and this to my mind shows that the unspoken
assumption was correct.
<P>

43  	Counsel for the plaintiffs then contended that the contract
should be construed with a view to a construction which supports
its validity
rather than a construction which introduces an illusory character to the
contract.  Counsel referred to <b>Biotechnology v Pace </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2015%20NSWLR%20130" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 15 NSWLR 130</a>
at 150-151.  Counsel contended that Rule 13.1(d) would be effectual if on its
construction it does not authorise what purportedly
happened on 25 February
1998.
<P>

44  	Counsel also observed that Heath Fielding Australia, the
Committee and it would seem the General Meeting acted on the basis
that the
decision of 25 February 1998 would not have finality until the General Meeting
approved, and that as the General Meeting
did not approve until 23 April after
the transfer to Mrs Wendy Langley, the transfer of the beneficial interest to
her could not
be unravelled; the alteration could not and did not purport to
deal with sales which had already taken place.  
<P>

45  	Counsel referred me to authorities which show that the Court
endeavours to determine the meaning of an ambiguous contract so
as to avoid
capricious, inconvenient and unjust results.  He referred to the following
observations of Gibbs J in <b>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v
Australasian Performing Right Association Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1973/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1973] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20129%20CLR%2099" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 129 CLR 99</a> at
pp109-110.  The whole of the passage is important; the sentences most
immediately significant are, at 109:
<P>

<i>"The court has no power to remake or amend the contract for the purpose of
avoiding a result which is considered to be inconvenient
or unjust.  On the
other hand, if the language is open to two constructions, that will be
preferred which will avoid consequences
which appear to be capricious,
unreasonable, inconvenient or unjust, `even though the construction adopted is
not the most obvious,
or the most grammatically accurate.'"</i>
<P>

46  	Counsel contended that it would be capricious, inconvenient and
unjust if Lancedale Holdings were to be told that the Committee
could amend the
Rules retrospectively and deprive it of its rights to sell to a third party.
Plaintiffs' counsel referred to <b>Swabey v Port Darwin Gold Mining
Company,</b> an obscurely reported decision referred to in <b>Bailey v NSW
Medical Defence Union</b>.  In <b>Swabey's case</b> Articles of Association had
been altered to diminish the rate of Directors' remuneration.  Lord Halsbury
L.C. (at 386) held that
an alteration in the Articles could only operate to
vary the Agreement for Remuneration between a Director and the company
prospectively:
<P>

<i>"A person who acts as director with those articles before him entered into a
contract with a company to serve as a director, the remuneration
to be at the
rate contemplated by the articles.  The person who does this has before him, as
one of the stipulations of the contract,
that it shall be possible for his
employer to alter the terms upon which he is to serve, in which case he would
have the option of
continuing to serve, if he thought proper, at the reduced
rates remuneration.  Those terms, however, could be altered only as to
the
future.  In so far as the contract on those terms had already been carried into
effect, it is incapable of alteration by the
company."  </i>
<P>

At 387 Lord Esher MR said:
<P>

<i>"It would be absurd to hold that one of the parties to a contract could
alter it as to service already performed under it."</i>
<P>

47  	Counsel also offered examples of possible alterations which
would not impact on existing rights; for example, the percentage
of issued
ordinary shares which could be Plan Shares prescribed at 24% by Rule 2.2.
These examples were said to show that there is
room for Rule 13.1(d) to have a
wide operation if limited as he contended it should be.  However he contended
that it should not
be understood that Lancedale Holdings and Mr Langley agreed
to be bound by or to comply with the Plan Rules in relation to an alteration
which could expropriate them years after they had complied with all their
obligations.  Counsel contended that an alteration could
relate to and operate
on Plan Rules which were to be laid before a new employee who had not yet
adhered to them in a different way
to their operation on the plaintiffs'
accrued rights.
<P>

48  	Counsel gave several illustrations of what could have been
achieved in certain ways, for example by a Plan established under
the Articles
or by Scheme of Arrangement under s 411 of the Corporations Law as it stood in
1993.  However these illustrations do
not bear directly on the argument.  
<P>

49  	I was not referred to any ground on which, if the alteration to
Rule 13.1(d) was effective, the cancellation of the shares
was not effective.

<P>

50  	Plaintiffs' counsel contended alternatively that the Court
should regard Rule 13.1(d) as limited to administrative matters.
 I do not
think that a limitation to administrative matters is authorised by the language
used, or can be clearly implied, or if
it were to be implied, that it could be
readily applied.  
<P>

51  	Defendants' counsel stood firmly on the breadth of the language
in Rule 13.1(d).  In this I think he was justified.  Drafting
can achieve
intended results, however surprising they are, if it is sufficiently clear, and
I think that Rule 13.1(d) is sufficiently
clear.  Defendants' counsel also
pointed out that there was no provision in the Articles in <b>Swabey's</b> case
analogous to Rule 13.1(d) including its parenthesis.  
<P>

52  	Defendants' counsel contended that cases relating to contracts
which were construed so as not to be illusory, such as <b>Biotechnology v
Pace</b> and cases there referred to, are concerned with the situation where
consideration is payable only if the promisor elected to pay
it; and that they
are all distinguishable for that reason. 
<P>

53  	In answer to the submission at para.44, defendants' counsel
submitted that no condition of approval is imposed by the terms
of the
Committee's resolution, or in any other way, and that there is nothing to
suggest that approval by an Extraordinary General
Meeting was a condition of
what the Committee intended to do.  I hold that according to its terms the
alteration of the Plan Rules
took effect on its date, 25 February 1998; and
that as the alteration was effectual it prevented the purported assignment to
Mrs
Wendy Langley from having effect.  The Buy-out Period had been extended
permanently before 7 April 1998, and the assignment was not
authorised by but
was contrary to the provisions limiting transfer under New Rule 7.7 without
first going through the Notice of Procedures
in Clause 7.6.  Those provisions
prevent the assignment from having effect.
<P>

54  	Alternatively, defendants' counsel contended that it should be
found that the transaction between Lancedale Holdings and Mrs
Wendy Langley was
not a genuine one and that Mrs Langley was under the control of Mr Langley;
that the transaction had a nominal
character only and was not in truth a sale,
and there was no obligation to accept the $100 proceeds in discharge of the
debt to Heath
Fielding Australia. One of the pillars of this argument was that
it was said to be strikingly anomalous that Mr Langley should sell
his shares
to Mrs Langley for $100 and discharge his debt to Heath Fielding Australia for
$100 rather than selling them to Heath
Fielding Australia for $122,638.44.
However in his overall situation, including the limits of his liability under
the Loan Agreement,
I do not see this conduct as anomalous. As the transaction
was ineffective for other reasons it is not necessary to decide the case
on
this issue.  However I am of the view that on the evidence before me, including
the oral evidence of Mr A.C. Langley, it should
be found that the transaction
was a genuine transaction and that Mrs Langley was not a nominee or otherwise
acting under the control
of Mr Langley.  If there had been no alteration to
Rule 7.1 the transfer to Mrs Langley would have been effectual.
<P>

55  	The question whether the shares truly have value is speculative
and unknown, and it was reasonable for Mr A.C. Langley and
Mrs Langley to act
on the basis expressed in evidence that one day the shares may be worth
something.  On that basis, and from the
point of view of Mr Langley and
Lancedale Holdings, $100 from Mrs Langley was the better offer.  
<P>

56  	The defendants' counsel submitted that there is a limit to the
operation of Rule 13.1(d), and the limit is that it relates
to matters with
which the Rules deal.  He said that the submission can be expressed by
reference to the principles in <b>Gambotto v. W.C.P. Ltd &amp; Anor </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20182%20CLR%20432" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995)
182 CLR 432</a> and the limit is one of degree.  He contended that in this case the
alteration was not concerned with fundamental matters or absurdly
onerous
matters, but was concerned with matters which on their face are not oppressive
in their formulation or operation, and are
not different in kind to provisions
which already have been made by the Plan Rules.  He pointed out that it was not
a situation where
Lancedale Holdings had been entirely deprived of all
opportunities to dispose of its shares, and contended that there was no abuse
of the power of alteration.
<P>

57  	The principles established in <b>Gambotto</b> relate to the
amendment of Articles of Association under statutory powers and cannot, in my
opinion, be applied outside the context
in which they were established.  In my
opinion the power in Rule 13.1(d) must be exercised in good faith for the
purposes for which
it was conferred.  However those purposes are very wide and
are not limited to regard for or protection of the interests of Lancedale
Holdings.  
<P>

58  	Nothing in the context suggests that the power of alteration
existed solely for the benefit of the employer on the one hand
or of the
employee on the other.  The power is a wide one, and can be exercised to
produce advantages for the employer without going
beyond the purposes of the
power, just as much as it can be exercised to produce advantages for the
employee.  The alterations extend
and modify provisions which already existed
in the Rules, and the power has not, in my opinion, been exercised in a way
which goes
beyond the purposes of the power discernible from the Rules as a
whole.  
<P>

59  	The power of alteration in Rule 13.1(d) is so wide as
practically to put it in the hands of the Committee, and in truth of
the
employer, to defeat the Executive's advantages under the Share Plan.  However
those advantages have no other origin than the
Share Plan, and the employer can
decide to grant and the parties can join in contractually adopting advantages
as heavily qualified
as they choose.  I do not see it as strange or anomalous
or inconsistent with the grant of an interest in the shares that the employer
should have or control an extremely wide power of alteration, and should keep a
strong upper hand in influencing whether the employee
really gets any benefit
of substance.  The parties can have a worm in their bud if they join together
in contracting to do so, and
the employer may not be prepared to give any
advantage at all except on that basis, while the Executive may regard it as
appropriate
to receive it on that basis rather than to have no Share Plan and
no advantage.  
<P>

60  	I do not see Rule 13.1(d) as entirely unlimited.  There are
limits arising from the limits (such as they are) of the concepts
of an
alteration, a modification and an addition.  A purported alteration which
introduced a new obligation of an entirely different
kind, or a transforming
alteration in an existing obligation, might be found to be beyond the concept
of an alteration and beyond
the powers in Rule 13.1(d).  
<P>

61  	The power of alteration should be approached with a
predisposition not to see it as extending to deprivation of rights which
have
accrued under the Plan Rules; I should apply a long-established judicial
predisposition to see documents which authorise alterations
of rights as not
operating on rights which have accrued or on property rights unless the
intention that they should is clearly discernible,
either from express language
or necessary implication.  However that approach does not in my view require me
to regard the alterations
made by the Committee on 25 February 1998 as beyond
power.  The parenthesis in paragraph (d) of Rule 13.1 expressly provides that
the alteration might adversely affect existing rights, or might otherwise
disadvantage an existing participant.  In the absence of
the parenthesis it
would be difficult to uphold the alteration, but the parenthesis is there, and
must be given effect.
<P>

62  	If Rule 13.1(d) had the effect that the Committee was
unrestricted in the alterations it could make, and could make alterations
which
entirely defeated any right of Lancedale Holdings, it is not clear to me that
the contract incorporating the Plan Rules would
be illusory for that reason.
Unless and until there were an alteration which had that effect there would be
real advantages for Lancedale
Holdings under the Agreement, and this is no less
true because they could be defeated by conduct which is entirely in the control
of one party.  I would not on any view class the contract as illusory in the
sense that the obligations of Heath Fielding Australia
were subject to
reservation of an option as to performance, so as not to create a contract at
all; see <b>Placer Development Limited v The Commonwealth </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1969/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1969] HCA 29</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281969%29%20121%20CLR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1969) 121 CLR
353</a> at 356 (Kitto J); and the restatement of the law on this subject in
<b>Biotechnology Australia Pty Limited v Pace</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2015%20NSWLR%20130" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 15 NSWLR 130</a> at
150-151 (McHugh JA).  See too the consideration of this subject by Emmett J in
<b>GIO v AMP Insurance Investment</b> (1998) 29 ACSR 584 at 636-637.
<P>

63  	If there were a problem with Rule 13.1(d) being illusory there
would also be a problem of severance; the possible outcomes
if the illusory
character of Rule 13.1(d) were to destroy the whole contract could be radical
and could themselves destroy the plaintiffs'
position and any interest in the
Plan Shares.<b>  </b>
<P>

64  	Although I approach the construction of Rule 13.1(d) with a
sense that it is anomalous that the power should extend to an alteration
which
took away some contractual right or advantage which had already accrued to the
Executive or the Family Company before the alteration
was made, and with a
disposition to adopt a construction in which an alteration can only operate
prospectively on such a right, the
parenthesis appears to me to make it
completely clear that the power to make an alteration extended to allow the
imposition of disadvantages
on any rights of the Executive or Family Company,
accrued or yet to accrue.  The alterations made on 25 February 1998 appear to
me
to show clearly an intention actually to affect existing rights as well as
to act prospectively.  The power of alteration is a qualification
of the grant
or concession made by the employer, and must be regarded as part of any
definition of what was granted.  The terms of
Rule 13.1(d) including the
parenthesis make this sufficiently clear.
<P>

65  	In the context of a pension fund and trust powers the judgment
of Waddell CJ in Eq in <b>Lock v. Westpac Banking Corporation </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2025%20NSWLR%20593" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 25
NSWLR 593</a> shows the nature of the limitations which may exist on a power of
amendment, and also the breadth of the amendments which may yet
be authorised.
His Honour referred to a number of significant decisions in cases with some
factual similarities.  However, where
a power of amendment is given to one of
the contracting parties, and there is no context of a trust or of powers of a
trustee, there
is little room for implying limitations on the power.  The terms
of Rule 13(1)(d) show that an alteration may prejudice the employee
and confer
advantage on the employer, and this leaves little room for practical operation
of limitations to exercise in good faith,
for the purposes of the share plan,
or for the benefit of all parties.
<P>

66  	After judgment was reserved the report of the decision of the
House of Lords in <b>Lord Napier and</b> <b>Ettric v. R.F. Kershaw Limited
</b><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/22.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] UKHL 22</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20WLR%20756" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 WLR 756</a> became available and I received written submissions from
each party's counsel dealing with its implications.  
<P>

67  	That case related to a power of amendment of a Premium Trust
Deed, an elaborate commercial arrangement under which moneys becoming
payable
to Lloyd's Names were carried to a trust fund to ensure payment of liabilities
entered into on behalf of each Name.  The
Society of Lloyd's was trustee and
had a power of amendment.  The trust existed in a commercial context of
protection of the insurance
industry regulated by Lloyds and of enabling the
industry's obligations to be met, not in any context of benefaction. Under the
Trust
Deed various moneys becoming payable to Names were to be carried to the
Trust Fund, and the Society of Lloyd's exercised the power
of amendment to
extend the range of moneys so payable to certain damages. The validity of the
amendments was the subject of a cross-appeal
which was successful in part, for
reasons stated by Lord Steyn at pp 765 to 767, affirming and in large part
adopting the reasoning
of Hobhouse LJ, who dissented in the Court of Appeal on
this subject.  
<P>

68  	Hobhouse LJ in a passage adopted by Lord Steyn addressed the
purpose of the deed, the contemplation of the deed and the relationship
between
the parties to it in deciding whether the amendment was valid: see 767D.  These
considerations were not raised by the terms
of the clause (set out at 759C)
which conferred the power of amendment.  Those terms were expressed in
completely general language,
and Lord Steyn's address to the reasonable
contemplation of the parties was not made in the course of construing the power
of amendment,
but in the course of applying to the exercise of the power a
limit expressed thus: (at 766E):
<P>

<i>"Secondly, it is true that there is a well established line of authority
which holds that a power of amendment reserved in a trust
must be exercised for
the purpose for which it was granted: see Hole v. Garnsey  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1930%5d%20AC%20472" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1930] AC 472.</a>  This
principle is closely linked with the general proposition that the power must
not be exercised beyond the reasonable contemplation
of the parties on which
Nourse LJ founded his judgment.  All this is hornbook law."</i>
<P>

69  	In the judgment of Hobhouse LJ in the Court of Appeal  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20LRLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997]
LRLR 1</a> at 13 this limit was expressed thus:
<P>

<i>"It was common ground between the parties both here and in the Court below
that a power such as that conferred by cl.22, although
unqualified in its terms
- </i>
<P>

<i>`... can be exercised only for the purpose for which it is conferred and not
for any extraneous or ulterior purpose.  [See Re Courage
Groups Pension
Schemes, [1987] 1WLR495, per Millet J at p505]'     </i>
<P>

<i>The issue was what exercise of the power was consistent with the purpose of
the trust deed.  It was not in dispute that the Council
had acted bona fide
..."</i>
<P>

70  	The authorities to which the English courts referred included
<b>Gra-Ham Australia Pty Ltd v. Perpetual Trustees WA Limited </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%201%20WAR%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 1 WAR
65</a>, which related to a power of amendment of a Unit Trust Deed in a commercial
context, where the amendment was made by the trustee
but with the approval of
the unit holders, and <b>Kearns v. Hill &amp; Anor </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2021%20NSWLR%20107" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 21 NSWLR 107</a>,<b>
</b>which related to an amendment made by trustees in a context apparently of
benefaction and not of commerce.
<P>

71  	The Share Plan is not a trust instrument and the Committee are
not trustees.  It is very common to find that the manner of
exercise of powers
is limited by requiring that they be exercised in good faith and for the
purposes for which they were conferred;
sometimes this is a limitation imposed
in Equity on the conduct of trustees or other persons with fiduciary
responsibilities who
deal with rights which exist only in Equity; and sometimes
a control of that kind is implied in the terms of the instrument creating
the
power.  Similar implications are usual for powers in public law.  In my view a
limitation of that kind applies to the exercise
of the power of amendment in
Rule 13(1)(d), but it has no practical effect in view of the width of the
purposes for which the power
of alteration exists and of their extension to
securing and enhancing the employer's position.  In my opinion there is no
basis for
imposing on the amendment the test applied in the <b>Napier</b> case,
or for considering whether the amendment falls within the reasonable
contemplation of parties to the Share Plan.  The "<i>reasonable
contemplation</i>" test is not a test applied in determining the meaning of the
rule which created the power of amendment.  I was glad to have counsels'
submissions on the <b>Napier</b> case, which as with their earlier submissions
were careful and helpful, but I have concluded that that case was determined on
principles
which are not presently applicable.
<P>

72  	Counsel referred me to a number of authorities dealing with
amendment of Articles of Association and other constitutions of
incorporated
and unincorporated bodies.  I do not see any general principles in these cases,
which largely turn on the terms of the
power of amendment under consideration
in each case; on the whole the cases illustrate the amplitude of powers of
amendment. 
<P>

73  	In my opinion the plaintiff is not entitled to any of the orders
claimed.  
<P>

74  	Defendants' counsel told me that the cross-claim does not arise
if the Court accepts his primary submission that the transfer
to Heath Fielding
Australia of shares and their cancellation was effective, because in that case
the application of the consideration
would extinguish the debt.  It is not
necessary to address the submissions made on the cross-claim.
<P>

75  	The orders are:
<P>

	1.	The proceedings are dismissed with costs.
<P>

	2.	The cross-claim is dismissed.
<P>

	3.	I order that each party pay its own costs of the cross-claim.
