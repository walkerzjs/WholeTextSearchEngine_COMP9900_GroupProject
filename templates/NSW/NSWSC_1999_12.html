<b>1940/98	MIDLAND IMPORTS PTY LTD  V  ASIA PACIFIC INTERNATIONAL PTY
LTD</b>
<P>

<b>1941/98	MIDLAND PTY LTD  V  ASIA PACIFIC INTERNATIONAL PTY LTD</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>	The Proceedings</b>
<P>

1	By a deed of loan dated 12 December 1997, the defendant/respondent in these
two proceedings (`Asia Pacific') made a loan to Midland
Pty Ltd, the
plaintiff/appellant in proceedings number 1941 of 1998 (`Midland').  By the
same instrument two individuals and Midland
Imports Pty Ltd (`Midland Imports')
guaranteed Midland's obligations as borrower.  Midland Imports is the
plaintiff/appellant in
proceedings number 1940 of 1998.  Security for the loan
included a mortgage over real property of Midland Imports.  Asia Pacific
served
a statutory demand on each of Midland and Midland Imports on about 10 March
1998 under s.459E of the Corporations Law, claiming
a debt for the balance of
principal and interest owing under the deed of loan.  
<P>

2	On 3 April 1998 each of Midland and Midland Imports applied in separate
proceedings to set aside the statutory demand made against
it.  The two sets of
proceedings came before Master McLaughlin on 6 August 1998.  He made orders by
consent, dismissing each summons
and varying the amounts of the statutory
demands.  Subsequently Midland and Midland Imports have each appealed from the
Master's
determination of their respective proceedings, notwithstanding that
the Master's orders were made by consent.  
<P>

3	The matters have accordingly come before me as appeals by Midland and Midland
Imports from the Master's decisions, under Pt 60
rule 10 of the Supreme Court
Rules.  There is also a notice of motion filed on behalf of Asia Pacific for
dismissal of the appeal
in matter No. 1940 of 1998, but the motion was not
separately dealt with.
<P>

4	Part 60 rule 10 confers a right of appeal from any `decision' of a master,
with an exception which is not presently relevant.
 The word `decision' is
defined in Pt 60 rule 1 to include an order, direction or determination.  The
Master's orders of 6 August
1998 constituted decisions by him within this
definition, notwithstanding that they were made by consent.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 101(2)(c)</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a> (NSW) states that an appeal does not lie to the
Court of Appeal, except by its leave, from a judgment given or order made in
proceedings
in the Court with the consent of the parties.  However, this
provision is in terms confined to appeals to the Court of Appeal, and
does not
apply to an appeal from the Master to the Court constituted by a Judge.  
<P>

5	The pleadings and affidavits in the two sets of proceedings are virtually
identical, making allowance for the fact that in one
case the
plaintiff/appellant is the borrower and in the other case the
plaintiff/appellant is the guarantor.  In each case the Notice
of Appeal
alleges that the Master erred in four different ways, which I shall discuss
later in this judgment.  When the matters came
before me on 27 November 1998
the appellants' solicitor made some submissions which raised grounds for appeal
not stated in the Notice
of Appeal.  He sought, inter alia, to challenge the
validity of the consent upon which the Master's orders were based, and to
contend
that Asia Pacific had acted unconscionably on 6 August 1998.  It seemed
to me that the proper way to advance and support these contentions
would be in
proceedings to set aside the agreement which constituted the consent upon which
the Master's orders were made, and that
it was inappropriate to seek to do so
in an appeal against the Master's orders.  I therefore made directions in each
matter that
the appellant initiate proceedings to set aside the Master's
orders, and that the parties file and serve affidavit evidence in accordance
with a very short timetable.  When the matter returned to me on Friday 4
December 1998 the appellants had not complied with these
directions but sought
leave to file and read an affidavit sworn by Kerry Abadee on 3 December 1998 as
additional evidence in the
appeals.  I admitted the additional evidence and,
the hearing of the appeals having been concluded, reserved my decision.  
<P>

6	I had already admitted additional evidence at the hearing of the appeals -
principally two further affidavits by Gregory Huxley,
a director of the
appellants.  The first, sworn on 20 September 1998, was relevant to the
question of validity of the consent of
the appellants to the Master's orders.
The second, sworn on 6 October 1998, was relevant to a contention made in the
appeal, though
not before the Master, that neither the principal sum nor
interest was owing at the time of service of the statutory demands.  There
are
issues, discussed below, as to whether either of these matters may be properly
raised in an appeal, but as those issues are not
clear cut, I decided that the
appropriate course was to admit the additional evidence on the ground that it
was relevant to those
matters.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s75a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 75A(8)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a>
(NSW) restricts the admission of further evidence when the appeal is from a
judgment after a trial or hearing on the merits;  obviously
different
considerations apply when the appeal is from consent orders made without
receiving any evidence.
<P>

	<b>Facts</b>
<P>

7	The facts of the two matters, so far as relevant to the various grounds of
appeal, are as follows.  With the assistance of an
agent, Midland negotiated a
loan from Asia Pacific, as trustee for the Planet Securities Unit Trust, in the
sum of $200,000 in December
1997.  The loan was a short term bridging loan,
repayable in full in February 1998, two months after it was made.  The
effective
interest rate for the loan was 13.87% per calendar month, the
`default' rate being 20% per calendar month.  The schedule to the deed
of loan
states that instalments of interest at the lower rate are to be paid monthly in
advance in the sum of $38,408, provided that
the two months' interest for the
term of the loan totalling $76,816 are to be paid on the advance date.  In fact
those two months'
interest in advance were borrowed, so that the total amount
of the loan at the advance date was $276,816.  
<P>

8	Midland failed to repay the advance of $276,816 on the due date for
repayment.  An extension of time was negotiated but apart
from a sum of
$21,000, no further payment was made.  On about 10 March 1998 Asia Pacific
served the statutory demands on both Midland
and Midland Imports, claiming
$311,479.20 for outstanding principal and interest.  Subsequently a notice of
default dated 20 March
1998 was issued by Asia Pacific under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s111.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.111(2)(b)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a> (NSW) and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s57.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.57(2)(b)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act 1900</a> (NSW),
claiming the same principal amount and also interest of $110,726.40, together
with costs of $300.
<P>

9	In his affidavit in support of the summons to set aside each demand, Mr
Huxley asserted that the demand was defective for failing
to specify an address
for service in New South Wales, and that the amount of interest claimed in the
statutory demand represented
a penalty rate of interest and was void.  He also
asserted that the calculation of interest was defective because the due date
was
15 rather than 11 February, the plaintiffs paid interest of $21,000 rather
than $20,700 as acknowledged in the demands, and the interest
calculated in the
demands was not in accordance with the agreed rate and was inconsistent with
the notice of default.  Mr Huxley
also asserted that Midland and Midland
Imports had a cross-claim against the agent who introduced them to Asia
Pacific, on a ground
related to an undisclosed commission.  This last matter
was elaborated in his further affidavit sworn on 29 July 1998.  Asia Pacific
filed three affidavits by their solicitor to provide evidence in rebuttal,
sworn 28 April, 13 July and 3 August 1998.
<P>

10	At the hearing of the applications to set aside the statutory demands,
Gordon McGrath of counsel represented Asia Pacific, and
Kerry Abadee, a
solicitor employed by Bartier Perry, represented Midland and Midland Imports.
There is a transcript of the proceedings
before the Master, and the affidavit
by Ms Abadee dated 3 December 1998 gives a fuller account of what transpired.
According to Ms
Abadee's affidavit, what was said was to the following
effect:
<P>

	Ms Abadee:  These matters relate to a loan by the defendant.  There is a
dispute about the interest payable in respect of the loan.
 
<P>

	Master:  What amount is owing?
<P>

	Ms Abadee:  I have no instructions, Master.
<P>

	Master:  What amount is owing Ms Abadee?
<P>

	Ms Abadee:  I have no instructions, Master.
<P>

	Master:  Ms Abadee this is unacceptable.  I cannot set this matter down for
hearing until I know what amount your client says it
owes to the defendant.

<P>

	Ms Abadee:  An amount of $200,000 was advanced by the defendant to Midland.
To date that amount has not been repaid.  
<P>

	Master:  Ms Abadee, why should your client not be wound up now?  Your client
admits it owes $200,000 and chooses not to pay.
<P>

	Ms Abadee:  There is an argument available that no amount is owing.  The money
might not have been borrowed on its terms because
of certain misrepresentations
made before the money was advanced.
<P>

	Master:  Your client owes $200,000 and chooses not to pay it.  This is a
reprehensible approach.  When can you obtain instructions
as to when the
plaintiff will pay that amount?
<P>

	Ms Abadee:  I do not know if my client is contactable.
<P>

	Master:  Well, where is your client?  In Sydney?
<P>

	Ms Abadee:  In Sydney.
<P>

	Master:  Well, I suggest you get immediate instructions as to when the money
can be paid.  
<P>

	Ms Abadee:  I point out there are two separate companies, the loan may not
have been entered into had these representations not
been made.  
<P>

	Master:  Have your clients commenced proceedings in respect of those
misrepresentations?
<P>

	Ms Abadee:  No.
<P>

	Mr McGrath:  The plaintiff does point to a number of defects in the statutory
demand.  It is by no means perfect.  I think the
appropriate course is for the
plaintiff to obtain instructions.
<P>

11	The matter was stood down in the Master's list and Ms Abadee obtained
instructions from her clients.  Subsequently she and Mr
McGrath signed
handwritten short minutes of order for each matter, and the Master made the
orders and noted the matters referred
to in those documents.  In matter No.
1940 of 1998 the short minutes were as follows:
<P>

	`By consent:
<P>

	1.  Vary the amount of the statutory demand for payment of debt dated 9 March
1998 to $200,000.
<P>

	2.  Plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs as agreed or taxed. 
<P>

	3.  Summons dismissed.
<P>

	
<P>

	Note the agreement of the parties:
<P>

	(a) Payment of the $200,000 in compliance with the statutory demand as varied
in proceedings number 1940 of 1998 be taken as compliance
with the statutory
demand as varied in proceedings number 1941 of 1998. 
<P>

	(b) There be no estoppel as to the issue of another statutory demand for the
balance of the sum claimed in the statutory demand
dated 9 March 1998 by the
defendant against the plaintiff or otherwise.'
<P>

	The short minutes in matter number 1941 of 1998 were identical except for the
changes to the matter numbers.
<P>

	<b>Written Grounds of Appeal</b>
<P>

12	In each matter the appellant filed a Notice of Appeal on 4 September 1998
setting out four grounds of appeal, namely:
<P>

	1.	The Master erred in making an order to the effect that the appellant was
indebted to the respondent in the amount of $200,000
for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p5.4" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5.4</a>
of the Corporations Law whilst the respondent can still retain the appellant's
real property as security for such further sum that
the respondent alleges may
be due and owing pursuant to its mortgage.
<P>

	2.	The Master erred in not making an order or finding that any debt pursuant
to the mortgage was a contingent debt only for the
purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p5.4" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5.4</a> of the
Corporations Law until such time as the true amount due as between the parties
pursuant to the mortgage was established and
the respondent had taken the
appropriate enforcement proceedings to realise the real property security that
it holds.
<P>

	3.	Alternatively to paragraph 2, the Master erred in not making an order
finding for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p5.4" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5.4</a> of the Corporations Law the true amount due
as between the parties pursuant to the mortgage.
<P>

	4.	The Master erred in not making the necessary ancillary orders that would
allow the appellant a reasonable time to be able to
discharge the mortgage and
redeem its security upon the payment of the true amount due and owing on the
mortgage.
<P>

13	Assuming for the moment that the parties validly consented to the orders
which were made (an issue which I shall consider later),
in my opinion the fact
of their consent is a short but complete answer to all four of the written
grounds of appeal.  On that assumption,
the Master made the orders which were
made because the parties consented, and he made no other orders because the
agreement of the
parties reflected in their consent did not require that other
orders be made.  The parties to the proceedings are <i>sui juris</i>.  The
Master followed the normal course of making orders on the basis of the consent
of the parties signified by the signatures of
their legal representatives to
the draft short minutes of orders.  
<P>

14	In certain special circumstances it is proper for a court to refuse to make
orders requested by consent of all parties, those
circumstances being
conveniently summarised in <i>Ritchie's Supreme Court Procedure</i>
(Butterworths, looseleaf), paragraph [s 101.6], at page 1164.2.  Here, however,
there was nothing on the face of the draft short
minutes to suggest that the
consent of the parties was defective;  or that the orders were contrary to
legal principle, or vague
or uncertain;  or that the Court had no jurisdiction
to make them;  or that there was any condition precedent to the exercise of
the
Court's jurisdiction or any special responsibility for the Court to make its
own determination independently of the consent of
the parties;  or that the
public interest prevented the Court from giving effect to the private agreement
of the parties.  There
was accordingly no basis for the Master to decline to
make the orders requested by consent of the parties, and no basis for
contending
on appeal from the Master's orders that he made an error of law or
some other appealable error in making the orders which he made
- assuming, as I
have said, that the agreement signified by the parties' consent was valid.  
<P>

15	In my opinion the orders made by the Master were of a kind which could have
been made by the Court without the consent of the
parties, had the two matters
been fully heard.  By clause 4 of the deed of loan Midland as borrower
covenanted to pay Asia Pacific
as lender the debt and all interest accruing on
or before 11 February 1998.  The covenant to repay the principal and interest
was
not expressed to be contingent in any way.  The word `debt' was defined in
clause 1(c) to include all advances outstanding.  Clause
7(c) empowered Asia
Pacific to recover the debt by exercising its rights under the agreement
constituted by the deed or any collateral
securities without prejudice to and
without reference to Asia Pacific's rights under any other such instrument.  By
clause 8(m) neither
the making of the agreement constituted by the deed or any
other matter or thing was to extinguish, postpone or prejudice any other
security or charge at any time held by Asia Pacific and no other such security
or charge was to affect the agreement.  
<P>

16	As a matter of contract, therefore, recoverability of moneys owing under the
agreement was not contingent on the existence or
release of any collateral
security, or some subsequent calculation of the true amount owing, or the
enforcement of any collateral
security, or the allowance of time to the
borrower to redeem the security.  It follows that, to the extent that the
amounts claimed
in the statutory demands or pursuant to the Master's orders
were based on the agreement constituted by the deed of loan, the terms
of the
agreement are inconsistent with the four grounds stated in the Notices of
Appeal.
<P>

17	In an application to set aside a statutory demand served under s.459E of the
Corporations Law, the Court does not normally determine
whether the debt
claimed in the statutory demand is owing, or whether the enforcement of the
claim to payment may affect or be affected
by any collateral security which the
claimant may hold.  The issue for the Court to determine is whether the
statutory demand, failure
to comply with which may give rise to a presumption
of insolvency under s.459C, should be allowed to stand or be modified or set
aside on any of the grounds specified in the Corporations Law.  As Finkelstein
J said in <i>N T Resorts Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2016%20ACLC%20957" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998)
16 ACLC 957</a>, 959, there are in essence four grounds for applying to set aside a
statutory demand:  namely, that there is a genuine dispute about
the existence
or the amount of the debt (s.459H(1)(a));  or there is a genuine counter-claim,
set-off or cross-demand that is equal
to or exceeds the amount of the debt
(s.459H(1)(b));  or that there is a defect in the demand and substantial
injustice will be caused
if the demand is not set aside (s.459J(1)(a));  or
that there is some other reason why the demand should be set aside
(s.459J(1)(b)).
In the present cases the statutory demands were challenged as
defective because they failed to state an address for service in New
South
Wales, but it is hard to see how that defect could lead to substantial
injustice permitting the demands to be set aside under
s.459J(1)(a).  The other
challenges to the statutory demands, stated in Mr Huxley's affidavits of 3
April and 29 July 1998, appear
to relate to whether there is a genuine dispute
about the existence or the amount of the debt.  In my opinion it would have
been
open to the Court to conclude, after hearing the evidence, that even if
those objections to the demands were made out, at least $200,000,
the principal
amount borrowed, was immediately repayable.  Thus, the fact that the deed of
loan may have imposed an unlawful penalty
rate of interest would be unlikely to
prevent restitution of the principal amount lent.  Nor would the fact that
interest may have
been wrongly calculated in the statutory demands.  Nor the
fact that the borrower and guarantor may have been misled in some fashion
by
misrepresentations or failure to disclose an agent's commission, for if the
loan agreement were to be set aside for misrepresentation
it would probably be
on terms that the borrower make restitution of at least the principal amount
borrowed.
<P>

18	Section 459H(1)(a) requires the Court to determine whether there is a
genuine dispute about the existence or amount of a debt
to which the demand
relates.  If the Court is satisfied that such a genuine dispute exists, it has
a statutory duty to calculate
the substantiated amount of the demand in
accordance with the formula set out in s.459H(2).  This requires the Court to
determine
the admitted amount of the debt.  If, had he heard the case, the
Master had accepted all the arguments by Midland and Midland Imports
other than
arguments about defects in the demands themselves, he would have been obliged
to ascertain the admitted amount of the
debt and may well have concluded that,
whatever be the position with respect to the amount of interest claimed, the
principal amount
of the loan in the sum of $200,000 was an admitted amount of
debt and therefore the substantiated amount of the demand for the purposes
of
s.459H(2).  Once that conclusion had been reached, the Master would be
empowered by s.459H(4)(a) to make an order varying the
demands to $200,000 in
each case.  That is in fact what he did by the consent orders which he made on
6 August 1998.  
<P>

19	When the Court makes an order varying the amount of a statutory demand under
s.459H(4)(a), it is desirable in the interests of
clarity for the Court to make
an additional order under s.459H(4)(b) declaring whether the demand is to have
had effect, as so varied,
as from when the demand was served on the company.
Such an order was not made in this case, but it has not been submitted that the
absence of such an order would <i>ipso facto</i> affect the validity of the
orders which were made.  Letters were exchanged by the solicitors for the
parties on 11 August 1998, the
effect of which was that the parties agreed that
the time for compliance with the statutory demands, as varied, commenced to run
on 6 August 1998 when the orders were made.  In view of this correspondence,
neither party suffered any prejudice by virtue of the
absence of orders under
s.459H(4)(b).
<P>

	<b>Oral Submissions for Appellants</b>
<P>

20	At the hearing of the appeals on 27 November 1998, Midland and Midland
Imports were represented by Mr Foley, solicitor, who supported
the appeal on
broadly four grounds.  Although to a degree the grounds developed in his oral
submissions may have arisen out of the
written grounds in the Notices of
Appeal, I believe it is best to treat them separately in the interests of
clarity.  In view of
the conclusion I have reached in these cases, it is not
necessary for me to consider whether any consequences should flow from
discrepancies
between the written grounds of appeal and the oral argument at
the hearing of the appeals.
<P>

21	Mr Foley relied on these submissions:
<P>

	a)	the amount claimed in the statutory demands was not due and payable at the
time they were served;
<P>

	b)	there was no valid consent by the parties to the orders which the Master
made;
<P>

	c)	the Master applied undue pressure to the solicitor who appeared for Midland
and Midland Imports;
<P>

	d)	Asia Pacific's conduct on 6 August 1998 was unconscionable.
<P>

22	The first of these submissions is that the amount claimed in the statutory
demands and, specifically, the principal amount of
$200,000, was not due and
payable when the demands were served on about 10 March 1998.  Mr Foley
submitted that an arrangement was
in place, evidenced by a letter of
Christopher Carmody on behalf of Asia Pacific to Mr Huxley dated 27 February
1998, according to
which the principal amount of the loan would not become due
and payable while interest continued to be paid.  Mr Foley submitted
that
interest was paid either up to 25 March 1998 or up to 1 April 1998, depending
on which of two alternative methods of calculation
set out in Mr Huxley's
affidavit of 6 October 1998 is adopted.  
<P>

23	There is a dispute about the exact dates of the making of the loan and the
due date for repayment.  Midland and Midland Imports
say that the date of the
advance was 15 December 1997, not 12 December 1997 as shown in the schedule to
the deed of loan.  Therefore
the due date for repayment was 15 February 1998
rather than 11 February 1998, as shown in the schedule.  They point to the
letter
from Christopher Carmody to Mr Huxley dated 27 February 1998 as evidence
that Asia Pacific acknowledged that the later dates were
the correct ones
(affidavit of Mr Huxley sworn on 3 April 1998, annexure C).  Asia Pacific says
that the loan funds were remitted
to its solicitors' trust account on 12
December 1997, but the borrower had not satisfied the requirements for the loan
and accordingly
the funds could not be advanced on that date.  The outstanding
requirements were satisfied on behalf of the borrower on 15 December
1997 and
the funds were transferred in accordance with the borrower's direction on that
day.  Asia Pacific says that the date of
drawdown of the funds was accordingly
12 December 1997, and that the schedule to the deed of loan is therefore
correct;  any delay
in remittance of funds to the borrower was the result of
the borrower's failure to satisfy the requirements attaching to the advance;
Mr Carmody wrote his letter to Mr Huxley at a time when the facts surrounding
the reason for delay in the advance were not known
to him (affidavit of David
Christopher Brown of 3 August 1998, paragraph 4).  
<P>

24	Midland and Midland Imports say that the amount of $38,808 per month
specified in  the schedule to the deed of loan in fact represents
an interest
rate of 19.2% per month on a mortgage loan advance of $200,000.  If a correct
calculation were to be made at the interest
rate of 13.87% per month, the
amount of $76,816 would constitute payment of interest for a period of 84 days
from the date of the
mortgage advance (Mr Huxley's affidavit sworn on 6 October
1998).  
<P>

25	On 18 February 1998 Midland paid an amount of $21,000 on account of interest
at the request of the mortgagee.  There is also
a dispute about this amount,
Asia Pacific claiming to be entitled to deduct $300 for legal expenses and to
give credit for only $20,700
towards the payment of interest.  
<P>

26	Midland and Midland Imports claim that the combined effect of the 3-day
deferral of the advance date and the capitalisation of
$76,816 for interest and
the payment of $21,000 is that as a matter of mathematical calculation,
interest was paid up at the rate
of 13.87% until at least 1 April 1998 on a
capital amount of $200,000, and at least 25 March 1998 on a capital amount of
$276,816.
 Consequently nothing was due and payable at the time when the
demands were served.
<P>

27	In the <i>N T Resorts</i> case, referred to above, Finkelstein J considered
an application to set aside a statutory demand on the ground that the debt was
not due and payable, because it was alleged that the creditor had given the
debtor an extension of time which had not passed when
the statutory demand was
served, though the debtor admitted that the amount became due and payable
subsequently.  His Honour took
the view that in such circumstances the
challenge to the demand fell to be considered under s.459J(1)(b).  Claiming the
debt before
it was due and payable did not amount to a `defect' in the demand
under s.459J(1)(a).  He said that for the purposes of s.459J(1)(b)
there would
be `some other reason why the demand should be set aside' if the Court were to
be satisfied that there was a genuine
dispute about whether the debt to which
the demand related was due and payable at the time when the demand was served.
I respectfully
agree.  In the present case, however, this ground for
challenging the statutory demand was not advanced in any pleadings or
affidavits
filed on behalf of Midland and Midland Imports prior to the hearing
before the Master on 6 August 1998.  It appears from the transcript
and the
affidavit of Ms Abadee of 3 December 1998 that this ground was not advanced at
the hearing itself.  If the matter had been
raised for the first time at the
hearing before the Master, the interests of justice would have required that
Asia Pacific be given
the opportunity to adduce evidence with respect to the
alleged arrangement and the calculation of interest before the question could
be properly addressed by the Court.  In any case, orders were made by consent
which disposed of the proceedings.  Unless the consent
is vitiated, my opinion
is that it is not open to the appellants to raise the issue in the context of
an appeal.
<P>

28	Mr Foley's second ground is that there was no valid consent by the parties
to the orders which the Master made.  He put this
matter in two ways.  First,
he said that the orders which were made were in substance proposed by the Court
and merely accepted by
his clients, and there was no underlying bargain between
the parties prior to the making of the orders.  He relied on two cases,
both of
which explore the meaning of `consent' for the purposes of the proposition that
an appeal does not lie without leave against
an order made by consent of the
parties (a proposition arising out of case law in the circumstances of the
first case, and enshrined
in a statute applicable in the circumstances of the
second case).  In <i>Rogers v Curnow</i>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%2022%20SASR%20204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 22 SASR 204</a>, 207 Zelling J
drew a distinction between an order of the Court which embodies a compromise
agreed to by the legal representatives
of the parties or by a pre-existing
agreement between the parties, reflecting in each case a bargain made between
the parties or
on their behalf, and the mere acceptance by the appellant of the
orders offered by the Court.  In <i>Sky-Ridge Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Burlington Pty
Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/tas/TASSC/1995/103.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] TASSC 103</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%204%20Tas%20R%20485" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 4 Tas R 485</a>, 494 Underwood J referred to <i>Chandless-Chandless
v Nicholson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1942%5d%202%20KB%20321" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1942] 2 KB 321</a> where the English Court of Appeal drew a
distinction between a consent order  `in the technical sense', where the order
reflects
a contract made by or on behalf of the parties, and an order which
merely embodies provisions to which neither party objects.  He
also drew
attention to <i>Siebe Gorman &amp; Co Ltd v Pneupac Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20WLR%20185" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] WLR 185</a>, 189
where Lord Denning MR saw the question as being whether the order evidences a
real contract between the parties, or is merely
an order made without
objection.  Underwood J also identified cases where the parties' consent is a
factor in the exercise of the
judicial discretion but is not the only factor,
in which case the orders of the Court are not properly described as consent
orders.
<P>

29	In the present case the Master made it emphatically clear to Ms Abadee that
if the plaintiffs in the two cases acknowledged an
indebtedness for at least
$200,000, he could not see the justification for hearing their application to
set aside the statutory demands
entirely rather than merely to vary them.  But
he then stood the matter down in his list and did not purport to dictate or
impose
the terms of any orders which would be made.  He left it to the parties
to obtain instructions.  When he returned to the matter he
was informed that
the legal representatives of the parties had obtained instructions to consent
to orders in the form of draft short
minutes of orders which were handed up,
duly signed by both of them.  The Master did not have any part in drafting the
short minutes.
 He made the orders in terms of the short minutes as orders made
by consent.  
<P>

30	The Master proceeded on the basis that there was a real bargain between the
parties and the parties by their legal representatives
proceeded on the basis
that they had made an agreement to be embodied in the orders.  On the facts,
therefore, this was not a case
where the parties merely accepted orders offered
by the Court or the Court merely made orders to which neither party objected.
While
there is an issue (discussed below) as to whether the parties' bargain
was vitiated by unilateral mistake, there was nothing before
the Master to
suggest to him that the bargain was deficient in any way.  While the orders
varying the statutory demands were made
in the exercise of the judicial
discretion conferred by s.459H(4), the exercise of that discretion was the
result of the parties'
consent and in view of the presence of that consent,
there was no other factor which needed to be taken into account.  The orders
were made to perfect the pre-existing contract represented by the parties'
consent to the disposition of the proceedings.  I therefore
reject Mr Foley's
contention that the orders were merely accepted by his clients without any
underlying bargain between the parties.
<P>

31	Mr Foley also submitted that, if there was a contract entered into by the
legal representatives of the parties on behalf of their
respective clients,
that contract was vitiated by a mistake on the part of his clients which
entitles them to have it set aside.
 <i>Harvey v Phillips </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1956/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%2095%20CLR%20235" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) 95 CLR
235</a>, 243-4, is authority for the proposition that if the legal representatives
of the parties consent to orders with their clients' actual
authority, the
question whether their contract is to be set aside depends on the existence of
a ground which would suffice to render
a simple contract void or voidable or to
entitle a party to equitable relief against it:  see also <i>General Credits
Ltd v Ebsworth </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%202%20QdR%20162" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 2 QdR 162</a>, 165;  <i>Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v

NSWLR 193</a>, 198, 200-201.  Mr Foley said that the unilateral mistake lay in his
clients' understanding that the security held by Asia Pacific
for repayment of
the loan would be released, so that they could offer security over that
property to permit them to raise $200,000
to meet the varied amount of the
statutory demands.  In his submission, it would be illogical for them to have
agreed to orders having
the effect of obliging them to pay $200,000 to Asia
Pacific, while leaving their property secured to Asia Pacific to meet its
disputed
claim for interest (see Mr Huxley's affidavit sworn on 20 September
1998).  
<P>

32	According to Ms Abadee's affidavit of 3 December 1998, Mr McGrath said to
her before the orders were made `we will want to keep
our security' and she
made no response.  The orders which were then made contained no reference to
the security.  Ms Abadee wrote
to Asia Pacific's solicitors on 11 August 1998
stating that in order to pay the $200,000, it would be necessary for her
clients'
incoming mortgagee to take the security then held by Asia Pacific, and
seeking confirmation that Asia Pacific would release its security.
 By a letter
of the same date Asia Pacific's solicitors responded stating that their client
would not release its security without
payment of the outstanding debt in full,
and setting out a calculation of the outstanding amount of the debt including
interest,
which according to them was $955,071.88 by that time.  Ms Abadee also
wrote to Mr Huxley on 11 August 1988 expressing the `preliminary
view' that it
would be unconscionable for Asia Pacific to make applications for winding up in
circumstances where it was not willing
to release its security to allow the
debt to be paid.  
<P>

33	The central principle of law governing the effect of unilateral mistake on a
contract was set out by Mason ACJ, Murphy and Deane
JJ in <i>Taylor v Johnson
</i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20151%20CLR%20422" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 151 CLR 422</a>, 432 as follows:
<P>

	`a party who has entered into a written contract under a serious mistake about
its contents in relation to a fundamental term will
be entitled in equity to an
order rescinding the contract if the other party is aware that circumstances
exist which indicate that
the first party is entering the contract under some
serious mistake or misapprehension about either the content or subject matter
of that term and deliberately sets out to ensure that the first party does not
become aware of the existence of his mistake or misapprehension.'
<P>

34	The application of that principle requires the Court to embark on a factual
inquiry as to whether the first party was indeed
under a serious mistake in
relation to a fundamental term of the contract, and as to whether the other
party was aware of circumstances
indicating the first party's misapprehension
and deliberately sought to ensure that the first party did not discover its
mistake.
 Even the wider principles to which Handley JA referred in <i>Tutt v
Doyle </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%2010" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 10</a>,14, require a substantial factual inquiry.  
<P>

35	The evidence before me in the present case is too skimpy and incomplete for
me to make the factual findings which would support
a case of unilateral
mistake, even if it were appropriate for me to do so in the context of the
present appeals.  Moreover, the procedure
by which the issue comes before me is
so far removed from the normal procedure for raising and testing such issues
that there would
be a serious risk of miscarriage of justice if I were to
purport to deal with the matter at the present stage. The question of
unilateral
mistake was raised, evidently for the first time, in oral
submissions in the appeal, and was put in a number of different ways in
the
course of argument.  The appellants rely on the affidavits of Mr Huxley dated
20 September 1998 and Ms Abadee dated 3 December
1998, but the evidence of
those witnesses has not been tested by cross-examination.  The respondent has
not provided affidavit evidence
in reply.  Evidently unaware of the possibility
that an issue may arise upon which he might personally be called to give
evidence,
Mr McGrath has appeared before me as counsel for Asia Pacific.  
<P>

36	There may be cases where it is appropriate to entertain an application to
set aside the bargain upon which consent orders have
been made, and
consequently the orders themselves, in an appeal against the making of the
orders.  But I would have thought it unlikely
that it would be appropriate to
do so unless the grounds for setting aside the bargain have been notified to
the respondent in a
timely manner, and appropriate directions have been made
for the filing of affidavits and the taking of other evidence.  The usual
and
generally preferable course will be for separate proceedings to be commenced to
set aside the bargain and consequent orders:
 <i>Kinch v Walcott </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1929%5d%20AC%20482" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1929] AC
482</a>, 494;  <i>Ainsworth v Wilding</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1896%5d%201%20Ch%20673" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1896] 1 Ch 673</a>;  <i>Spies v Commonwealth
Bank of Australia</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2024%20NSWLR%20691" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 24 NSWLR 691.</a>
<P>

37	In the present case there is nothing to induce departure from the normal
course, although the matter is obviously one of considerable
urgency.  As
earlier mentioned, after I heard the submissions of the parties on the appeals
on 27 November 1998, I made directions
which were intended to put the
appellants' application to set aside the orders and the underlying bargain on a
proper procedural
footing.  The appellants have not complied with those
directions and consequently they have not taken up the opportunity to
constitute
separate proceedings to set aside the orders and the underlying
bargain.  In those circumstances, and for the reasons set out above,
my opinion
is that the evidence is insufficient for me to make the findings of fact
necessary to set aside the orders and bargain
on the ground of unilateral
mistake, and further my opinion is that it would not be appropriate to do so in
the proceedings as presently
constituted.  
<P>

38	The appellants also contend that Ms Abadee, their legal representative on 6
August 1998, was subjected to undue pressure by the
Master.  Mr Foley submitted
to me that the Master `badgered' her, and `oppressed or frightened' her.  He
did not spell out the precise
legal consequences which were alleged to flow
from such conduct, but I am prepared to proceed on the basis that if the
allegations
were made out, the Master's conduct would constitute a ground of
appeal whether or not it supplied the ingredients necessary to vitiate
the
bargain between the parties on the ground of duress or undue pressure.  I find,
however, that the Master's conduct was not oppressive
or otherwise unfair, and
therefore that this ground of appeal has not been made out on the facts.  
<P>

39	It appears from the transcript and from Ms Abadee's affidavit of 3 December
1998 that the Master played a very active role in
the hearing on 6 August 1998.
In my opinion, however, the Master's response to the material placed before him
was fair and proper.
 He was entitled to infer on the basis of the documentary
material in the file and the submissions made to him that the grounds advanced
by Midland and Midland Imports for disputing the debt would be most unlikely to
lead to the consequence that they would have no obligation
to repay the sum of
$200,000 which Midland had received.  At that stage it had not been contended
that nothing had become due and
payable at the time of service of the demands.

<P>

40	In those circumstances, the Master was right to perceive that if Midland and
Midland Imports admitted to owing $200,000, the
most they could hope for would
be an order under s.459G(4) varying the demands down to that amount.  That
being so, I believe he
was entitled to insist, as he did, that Ms Abadee obtain
instructions as to whether her clients acknowledged that at least $200,000
was
due and payable, and if so, whether both parties would consent to orders along
the lines which were in fact made.  This would
give Midland and Midland Imports
the best result which they could hope for, assuming they admitted a debt of
$200,000 presently due
and payable, while allowing Asia Pacific to take
advantage of the statutory presumption of insolvency in proceedings for
liquidation,
if the demands were not met, and leaving the issue of indebtedness
for interest totally at large.  There was nothing to indicate
that the Master
considered the question of release of security, and it was unnecessary for him
to do so.
<P>

41	Mr Foley also submitted that Asia Pacific acted unconscionably in the events
which happened on 6 August 1998.  He said that when
the statutory demands were
served, Asia Pacific was not entitled to serve demands, and it was
unconscionable of it subsequently to
stand by and allow orders to be made
varying the statutory demands to $200,000, knowing they were defective and that
its security
would be retained for the balance claimed.  Mr Foley relies on the
judgment of Young J in <i>Doyle v Tutt</i> (Supreme Court of New South Wales,
16 September 1993), the appeal from which is reported at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%2010" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 10.</a>

<P>

42	In Young J's judgment, under the heading `estoppel', his Honour referred to
estoppel `in its most primitive form', estoppel by
conduct.  He said:
<P>

<i>	</i>`If, for instance, a person stands by knowing that another person has
made a mistake and acted to his or her detriment, then the first
person is
estopped from afterwards asserting the true facts.'
<P>

43	Mr Foley's submission is not made out on the facts before me in these
appeals.  It is true that according to the transcript and
Ms Abadee's affidavit
of 3 August 1998, Mr McGrath acknowledged that there were defects in the
statutory demands, which were `by
no means perfect'.  However, according to
s.459J(1)(a) defects in a statutory demand do not provide a ground for setting
it aside
unless the Court is satisfied that substantial injustice will be
caused unless the demand is set aside.  It was not in any way unconscionable
for Asia Pacific by its counsel to seek orders varying the statutory demands
even though the demands were acknowledged to be defective,
since there was no
acknowledgment that the defective demands would cause substantial injustice
unless they were set aside.  Moreover,
Ms Abadee consented to the orders which
were made after Mr McGrath conceded that the demands were defective.  Nor was
it unconscionable
for Asia Pacific by its counsel to seek to retain the
security which had been granted to it in respect of the interest as well as
principal on the loan, while consenting to orders which varied the statutory
demands, in the absence of evidence establishing that
Mr McGrath knew that Ms
Abadee had proceeded on a mistaken basis.  The security had been granted at the
time when the loan was made,
and Mr McGrath made it clear before the draft
short minutes were handed up to the Master that Asia Pacific would want to
retain the
security (see Ms Abadee's affidavit of 3 December 1998, paragraph
4).
<P>

44	Apart from the matters set out in the Notices of Appeal and the submissions
made by Mr Foley at the hearing of the appeals, there
is some evidence to
suggest that the agent who assisted Mr Huxley to negotiate the loan from Asia
Pacific, for a fee, also obtained
a secret commission from Asia Pacific.  Mr
Huxley's affidavit of 29 July 1998 provides evidence to this effect.  The
factual contention
was not developed or tested either before the Master or
before me on appeal.  But even if the facts were as alleged, it is far from
clear that those facts would provide a basis for setting aside the deed of
loan; and even if they did, it is likely that Asia Pacific
would be entitled at
least to restitution of the $200,000 principal sum which it lent.  It would
therefore not have been irrational
for Midland and Midland Imports to
acknowledge that $200,000 was owing notwithstanding the claim to non-disclosure
of the commission.
 In any event, that admission was in fact made and they
consented to Master McLaughlin's orders.  The claim to non-disclosure of
commission provides no basis for challenging the consent given on 6 August
1998.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

45	My conclusion, therefore, is that none of the grounds of appeal advanced in
the Notices of Appeal or in oral submissions is successful.
 The appeals in
both matters should therefore be dismissed.  I shall hear the submissions of
the parties on costs, though I am disposed
to order that the appellant in each
matter pay the respondent's costs of the appeal.
