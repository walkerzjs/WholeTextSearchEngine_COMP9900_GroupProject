<b><u>2888/99 PUBLIC TRUSTEE v CARMELA THEISSL</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  This is an application by the Public Trustee
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74k.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74K</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act 1900</a> for an order over the operation
of a caveat number 5615229 which is entered against the title of property 11
Domain Court, Baulkham
Hills, be extended until further order.
<P>

2   	The Public Trustee is administrator of the estate of John
Albert Theissl who died on 7 November 1994, he having been murdered.
  Letters
of administration were granted to the Public Trustee on 31 July 1995, with
leave reserved to Carmela Theissl to apply for
the removal of the Public
Trustee and for her own appointment.  Although some assets were disclosed in
the inventory of property
annexed to the grant of administration, it seems that
no assets have been received in the estate, superannuation moneys have been
paid or applied for the benefit of the three children of the deceased, and the
value of long service leave, holiday pay etc. having
been paid direct to the
widow.
<P>

3   	At the date of his death the deceased and his wife, Mrs
Theissl, were registered as proprietors, as joint tenants, of property,
2
Campbell Street, Northmead.  Thus, on the death of the deceased, that property
passed to his wife as the surviving joint tenant,
or at least the legal estate
in it did.  The Public Trustee entered a caveat against the title to that
property, claiming an undivided
one half share in the estate.
<P>

4   	By agreement, when the widow wished to sell that property,
the caveat was withdrawn, and the caveat the subject of the present
proceedings
was entered against the title of the new property purchased by Mrs Theissl.
There is no proper basis set out in the caveat
for the interest claimed, but
nevertheless the interest which is claimed proceeds upon the following
basis.
<P>

5   	It is said that the deceased was murdered.  Two persons,
namely Gary Glasby and Suzette Glasby have been convicted of his murder.
 Both
of those persons have been sentenced to substantial periods of imprisonment.
The defendant, Mrs Theissl, was also committed
for trial for the murder of her
husband.  However, the Director of Public Prosecutions determined not to
proceed with the prosecution
and acceded to a no bill application.
<P>

6   	It seems likely that this decision was based on the fact
that evidence would be required from the two persons convicted and
that such
evidence was conflicting and, by its nature, would not be sufficient to support
the charge, if brought.
<P>

7   	The position of the Public Trustee is that, despite that
decision, it might be found by a court in a civil proceedings that
the
defendant did murder her husband, or was in some way responsible for his death,
in which circumstance the court could be expected
to make an order or to
declare that the property purchased in substitution for the property originally
jointly held at Northmead,
was held as to a one half share or an appropriate
share upon trust for the estate of the deceased, thereby giving the Public
Trustee
an interest in it.
<P>

8   	At the present time, apart from the fact of the original
charge, it could not be said that there is anything to show that the
Public
Trustee might have an interest in the subject property, and indeed unless and
until some constructive trust is imposed, it
is clear that he has no such
interest.
<P>

9   	It is possible that at some stage in the future, if
proceedings are brought by the Public Trustee against Mrs Theissl, seeking
the
imposition of a constructive trust, those proceedings might succeed, but that
is a possibility only and certainly could not be
said to be a probability as
things stand.  Apart from anything else, the Public Trustee has made an
application for judicial advice
as to what action he should take, and although
that matter is before the court at the present time, there are significant
questions
about the funding of any such action.
<P>

10   	In a matter such as this there remains some underlying
discretion in the court as to whether or not an order should be made
extending
the caveat when, on the evidence presently available, the interest which is
claimed has not been shown to exist, but merely
"might", if subsequent
proceedings succeed, be shown to exist.
<P>

11   	In my view at the present time the possible interest
claimed is so remote that in the exercise of the discretion no order
extending
the caveat should be made.
<P>

12   	There is an alternative claim in the summons for an
injunction restraining the defendant from dealing with the land in question
until further order.  In my view such a claim could be no stronger than  the
claim for extension of a caveat and is, I think, considerably
weaker.
<P>

13   	In all the circumstances the summons in matter number 2888
of 1999 should be dismissed with costs.
<P>
