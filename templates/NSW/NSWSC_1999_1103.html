<P>

<b>Reasons for judgment</b>
<P>

1    	HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiff in these proceedings has
brought two actions against the defendants, one under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ctra1897288/" class="autolink_findacts">Compensation to
Relatives</i> <i>Act</i> 1897</a> on behalf of herself and her two children, and
the other in her own right seeking damages for nervous shock.  The actions
arise from
the same set of circumstances.  On 29 September 1999 I refused an
application by the defendants for the trial of the proceedings
under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ctra1897288/" class="autolink_findacts">Compensation to Relatives Act</a></i> without a jury.  I sketched the relevant
background in the reasons which I delivered on that day, and there is no need
to repeat
it. 
<P>

2    	In the present application, the plaintiff seeks leave
to file out of time a requisition for a jury in the trial of the action
for
nervous shock, together with a direction that the two actions be heard
together.  The defendants accept, in the light of my judgment
of 29 September,
that they could not contend that the trial of the action for nervous shock by
jury, standing alone, would be unfair.
 Equally, senior counsel for the
defendants realistically acknowledged the difficulty of opposing that mode of
trial simply because
the requisition for it would now be well out of time: see
the judgment of Rath J in<i> Percy v General Motors Holden Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%201%20NSWLR%20289" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 1
NSWLR 289</a> at 295.
<P>

3    	The defendants' primary objection is to the two
actions being heard together by the same jury.  It was submitted that the
multiple issues which would need to be determined in such a trial would place
unreasonable demands upon a lay tribunal.  In addition,
it was argued that the
emotional nature of the evidence bearing upon the claim for nervous shock might
deflect the jury from a dispassionate
examination of the evidence in the
Compensation to Relatives claim.  The best way to deal with the proceedings, it
was said, would
be for the trial judge in the Compensation to Relatives action
to proceed to hear the nervous shock claim, sitting alone, immediately
after
the hearing of the first action.  In that event, much of the evidence led
before the jury in the first action could be received,
by consent, at the
hearing of the second. 
<P>

4    	There is no doubt that this would be a practical way
of disposing of the proceedings as a whole.  Nevertheless, I am conscious
of
the plaintiff's <i>prima facie</i> entitlement to trial by jury of the nervous
shock claim.  In my earlier judgment I referred to the affirmation of this
entitlement
by Kirby P in <i>Pambula District Hospital v Herriman</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 14
NSWLR 387</a> at 399, 405.  No-one suggested that the two actions should be tried
separately by different juries.  Clearly, such a course would
be unduly
expensive and time consuming.  The question to be determined, then, is whether
the trial of the two claims by the same
jury would be unfair. 
<P>

5    	I think not.  It is true that, although the major
issue of causation of the death of the deceased is common to both actions,
they
involve different bases of liability and the award of damages in each case is
governed by different considerations.  However,
there is no reason to think
that a jury, properly instructed, could not cope with these issues.  Not
uncommonly, in criminal trials
juries face a similar task when the indictment
contains a number of counts.  
<P>

6    	Equally, I do not doubt the jury's capacity to
consider the issues dispassionately, unswayed by the emotion which might be
engendered by evidence of the plaintiff's reaction to her husband's death.
This also is a problem frequently encountered in criminal
trials, particularly
cases of homicide or serious violence.  In some joint criminal trials, juries
are called upon to distinguish
between the cases of the various accused in
circumstances where evidence admissible only against one of them could be
prejudicial
to another or others.  These matters routinely are the subject of
appropriate directions by the trial judge.
<P>

7    	Accordingly, I am not persuaded that the trial by
jury of the two actions together would be unfair.  Given the amount of evidence
which is common to them, there is every reason why they should be heard
together.  The plaintiff should have the orders she seeks,
and I shall consult
counsel about the precise form of them. 
<P>

8    	The defendants should pay the plaintiff's costs of
this motion.  Senior counsel for the plaintiff sought costs on an indemnity
basis, but I do not think that that is an appropriate course.  Notwithstanding
my decision of 29 September 1999, this motion raised
new issues which I was
able to resolve only after reflection, and the defendants' opposition to the
orders sought was not unreasonable:

(1994) 35 NSWLR<b> </b>277.
