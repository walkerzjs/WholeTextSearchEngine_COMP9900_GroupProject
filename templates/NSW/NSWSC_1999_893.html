<P>


<P>

<b>HER HONOUR</b>  :
<P>

1   	The prisoner Ronald Lewis Waters appears for sentence
following his pleas of guilty to two charges alleging that he was an
accessory
after the fact of murder.
<P>

2   	On 14 February 1994, at Gladesville in Sydney, Lindsey Rose
murdered Kerrie Pang and Fatma Ozonals.  He pleaded guilty to two
charges of
murder on 18 June 1998.  He claimed that he murdered Kerrie Pang at the behest
of her de facto husband, Mark Lewis, for
which Rose was to be paid the sum of
$20,000.  He murdered Ms Ozonals because she appeared unexpectedly at the scene
when he was
in the process of discharging his contract with Lewis.
<P>

3   	Lewis has also been charged with murder.  A trial is fixed
for hearing in October this year.  In the facts I am about to recite
Lewis's
participation and role is accepted, for the purposes of the present proceedings
only, as having been established.  The following
findings of fact, so far as
they involve Lewis, I make for the purpose of this sentencing exercise and not
otherwise.  As far as
Lewis is concerned, his guilt remains to be determined by
the appropriate tribunal of fact at trial.
<P>

4   	The facts are drawn principally from information provided
by the prisoner to police, many months after the events described.
<P>

5   	Sometime before 14 February 1994 Rose asked the prisoner to
accompany him to the address at Gladesville where Ms Pang conducted
a massage
parlour and Ms Ozonals was an employee, and present himself at the door while
Rose remained out of sight.  Rose's purpose
in involving the prisoner was to
enable himself to gain entry to the premises, believing that the occupants
would recognise him and
deny him admission.  He offered to pay the prisoner the
sum of $500 to perform this function.
<P>

6   	Accordingly, while Rose remained out of sight nearby the
prisoner approached and knocked on the door.  Ms Ozonals opened the
door and
Rose pushed past the prisoner, produced a gun he had been carrying in a paper
bag, and forced Ms Ozonals into another room.
 He reassured her - falsely, as
it turned out - when she expressed fears about her safety.
<P>

7   	The intended victim, Ms Pang, was not then present, but she
arrived shortly after, in the company of Lewis.  As they arrived
Rose shot Ms
Ozonals two or three times in the head.
<P>

8   	Lewis and Ms Pang entered the house, Lewis pushing Ms Pang
into the house and along the hall.  It seems that Ms Pang saw that
Rose was
armed and quickly appreciated his purpose.  She tried to assure him that
whatever had occurred between herself and Lewis
had been resolved but Rose
nevertheless shot at her also.  She engaged in a scuffle with Rose.  The
prisoner punched her two or three
times in the head.  She fled down the
corridor, pursued by Rose.  At some stage Lewis produced a rifle.  The
prisoner, who did not
know Lewis, disarmed him and restrained him.  While he
was doing this Rose told him that Lewis was paying for the killings.  Rose
fired a single shot to Ms Pang's head.  She fell, but then got up and ran down
the corridor, pursued by Rose.  Rose fired two further
shots at her before the
two disappeared into another part of the house.
<P>

9   	The prisoner was not in that immediate vicinity and did not
see what happened next.  However, post mortem investigation revealed
that Ms
Pang suffered numerous stab wounds to the neck and chest, as well as a gunshot
wound to the head.  Rose set fire to the house.
 He replaced the gun in the
paper bag in which he had brought it, which by now was wet with blood.  All
three men left the premises.
 Lewis placed the rifle he had in the vehicle in
which he had arrived and drove off.  Rose put the paper bag containing the gun
into
the boot of his vehicle;  as he did so, the blood caused the bag to fall
apart and its contents to spill into the car.  Besides the
gun the bag
contained a knife and some clothing.  
<P>

10   	Because Rose's glasses had been broken during the melee he
asked the prisoner to drive his car, but the prisoner was unable
to do so.
Rose accordingly drove them both to his home, where the prisoner assisted him
in unloading the items in the bag from the
boot of the car.  The prisoner
claims that this was the first time he became aware of the presence of the
knife.
<P>

11   	The prisoner had a shower to remove the blood from his
body, and Rose took his blood stained shirt to destroy it, and gave
him
another.  The prisoner then walked home.
<P>

12   	Although the prisoner remained in contact with Rose for
about a year afterwards, he heard nothing further about these events
and the
involvement of the two of them did not come to light until November 1996, more
than two and a half years later.  The prisoner
was then spoken to by police at
the Orange police station where he made admissions and gave extensive
information in an electronically
recorded interview.
<P>

13   	He maintained that when he first became involved he was
unaware of the purpose of the excursion to the premises.  He was taken
by
surprise by what happened in the house.  It was not until they were driving
back to Rose's home that Rose told him more about
the circumstances in which he
had become engaged.
<P>

14   	A  number of specific aspects of the prisoner's behaviour
constitute the accessorial offences.  It is to be borne in mind
that the
offences to which he pleaded guilty are of assisting Rose <u>after</u> the
commission of the murders.  He is not to be sentenced for his participation in
facilitating Rose's entry to the premises.  Chronologically,
the relevant
assistance the prisoner rendered began from the moment Ms Ozonals was shot and
killed, and consisted of his involvement
in the house thereafter (the
prisoner's account of what happened demonstrates that he became fully involved,
particularly in his
assault on Ms Pang and his attempt to subdue Lewis, not
realising that Lewis was in truth party to what Rose was doing);  his
(ineffectual)
attempt, or agreement, to drive Rose away from the scene of the
crimes;  his assistance in carrying the blood soaked bag containing
the gun and
knife to Rose's premises;  and, perhaps most significantly, his silence about
these events for the following two years
and nine months.
<P>

15   	That accessorial liability can be constituted by
non-disclosure of an offence is established:  <b>R  v  Farroukh</b>,
unreported, NSW CCA, 29 March 1996;  <b>R  v  Tan Do</b>, unreported, NSW CCA 7
May 1997.  
<P>

16   	The seriousness of the offences committed by the prisoner
should not be underestimated.  By <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s349.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 349</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a> </i>they
carry a maximum penalty of penal servitude for twenty-five years.  This was a
most serious instance of such an offence, not least
because the prisoner was
present throughout the entirety of the principal crime, and was therefore fully
aware of the nature and
extent of what Rose had done.  He can have been under
no illusion about what it was that he assisted, both in the immediate
aftermath,
and in the years that followed.  He was aware that the killings were
cold blooded contract killings, in Mrs Ozonals' case committed
merely because
she happened to be present.
<P>

17   	In saying this, I recognise that the prisoner was not in
the same room as that in which Ms Pang was killed, but he cannot
have helped
but be aware of the essence of what had happened.
<P>

18   	There are, of course, some subjective features that
mitigate the prisoner's culpability.  He was born on 31 October 1973.
 He was
therefore twenty years of age at the time of the offence.  He is now almost
twenty-six.  He has a relatively minor criminal
history, beginning in
Queensland in 1992, when he was eighteen years of age, and principally
consisting of offences associated with
drug use and possession, disorderly
behaviour and apparently minor property damage.  In this State he has been
convicted of having
custody of an offensive implement, in 1995, post dating the
present offences.  In respect of this charge he was fined $150.  
<P>

19   	I was provided with a pre-sentence report and a
psychiatric report, each prepared specifically for the purpose of sentencing
for these offences.  Each recounts a history of disrupted, dysfunctional family
life that resulted in the prisoner's adoption at
the age of six.  While he has
retained a relationship with both his adoptive parents he has recently
re-established contact with
his biological parents.  He was made a State Ward
at about twelve, and spent some time in boys' homes because of his habit of
absconding.
 He has had employment, of unskilled and semi-skilled kind and has
had periods of unemployment.
<P>

20   	He has now established a stable de facto relationship with
Cindy Rose Waters who is the mother of two children to whom the
prisoner has
become a supportive father.  His role in this respect has become increasingly
important since an incident concerning
his wife's six year old daughter, the
details of which need not here be recounted.  Nevertheless, the principles
relating to the
effect of sentencing upon others are well known.  This is not a
case in which hardship to the prisoner's family can be taken into
account to
mitigate the sentence. <b>R  v  Edwards</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2090%20A%20Crim%20R%20510" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 90 A Crim R 510.</a>
<P>

21   	Dr Nielssen, a forensic psychiatrist, has diagnosed the
prisoner as suffering from post traumatic stress disorder as a result
of the
events the subject of these proceedings.  The prisoner has suffered the full
range of symptoms associated with that disorder,
for more than five years, but
they have begun to abate as the present charges approach resolution.  While the
prognosis is for gradual
decline in the severity of the symptoms he is likely
to have some lingering effects for the rest of his life and would benefit from
a period of counselling to assist him to develop techniques to reduce anxiety,
place the events in perspective, and assist in his
emotional development.  
<P>

22   	He is, of course, entitled to credit for his plea of
guilty.  The Crown conceded that, while the pleas may at first sight
appear to
have been entered at a late stage, they were in fact entered at the first
opportunity in that initially he had been charged
with murder.  As soon as the
Crown signified its willingness to accept pleas to the lesser charges in full
satisfaction of the indictment
the prisoner offered and entered such pleas.  He
is therefore entitled to full credit arising from that circumstance.
<P>

23   	Moreover, from the time of his arrest he has indicated a
willingness to assist the authorities.  He has provided an undertaking
to give
evidence in Lewis' forthcoming trial and the Crown concedes that this evidence
is likely to be valuable, particularly in
the light of doubts about the
willingness of Rose to render similar assistance.  If Rose does in fact decline
to give evidence, the
prisoner will be the only witness able to identify Lewis
as having been present.  He is also expected to give evidence to implicate
Lewis in the arrangements to kill Ms Pang.  That his evidence is likely to be
significant is demonstrated by the fact that Lewis
was not charged until the
prisoner provided his statement to police.  The prisoner gave a similar
undertaking in relation to the
charges against Rose but was not called upon to
discharge his undertaking because Rose eventually pleaded guilty.
<P>

24   	The prisoner has spent, in all, three months and six days
in pre-sentence custody.  There was some debate about whether the
whole of this
time should be attributed solely to the present offences, it appearing that
some days might have been attributable
to fine defaults, but I think the whole
of the period should be treated as referable to these offences.  About two
months of that
time was spent in the more severe conditions of protection,
because of his offer of assistance.  Any sentence he serves will also
be served
on protection.  It must also be remembered that he has adhered to stringent
bail conditions including regular reporting.
 
<P>

25   	The Crown has argued that the offence is so serious as to
call for a period of full time custody.  Prima facie that proposition
is
undeniable.  As I have earlier noted the prisoner can have been under no
misapprehension about the seriousness of Rose's crime,
and consequently of his
own role that had the effect of protecting Rose.  Indeed, his own psychiatric
response evidenced by the condition
of post traumatic stress disorder
demonstrates his consciousness of the gravity of the conduct in which he was
involved.
<P>

26   	There is, besides the plea of guilty, evidence of genuine
contrition.  This, too, is shown partly by the stress disorder,
partly by his
plea of guilty, partly by his comprehensive admissions and information to
police, and partly by his willingness to
assist and give evidence.  Further, he
never received the payment he was promised for the assistance he gave, and
never sought to
do so.  There was a suggestion put to him during the course of
the interview that he had asked Rose for payment, but he said that
he had on
one occasion asked for money for cigarettes but this was not forthcoming and he
considered that it was inappropriate, having
regard to what he had seen and
done, to seek or receive payment for his involvement.
<P>

27   	The contrition, which I accept as genuine, the psychiatric
report, and the evidence of his de facto persuade me that rehabilitation
has
effectively been achieved.  This means that considerations of personal
deterrence may be given marginal importance.
<P>

28   	In my view the most serious aspect of the prisoner's
conduct was the long period of non disclosure during which  it must have
seemed
likely that Rose would escape the consequences of his conduct.   In this
respect I cannot overlook the fact that the prisoner
declined to give sworn
evidence in the sentencing proceedings.  His counsel pointed to a good deal of
material contained in the record
of interview which goes some way to explain
his silence.  There were a number of occasions on which he said that Rose had
threatened
him with serious consequences if he disclosed what he knew.  It does
not take a great deal of imagination to accept that, having
observed what Rose
had done, the prisoner would be likely to have taken these threats seriously.
He well knew what Rose was capable
of.  Moreover, Rose had an association with
a corrupt police officer, Alan Robert Thomas, who was, on 1 June 1998,
sentenced in relation
to a large number of serious offences, including failing
to disclose Rose's involvement in the murders of Ms Pang and Ms Ozonols.
 I am
therefore able to infer that the prisoner feared to divulge any information,
although, as I have observed, there was no direct
evidence from him to this
effect.
<P>

29   	Further, as the background reports reveal, the prisoner
was, for much of his early life, deprived of those opportunities that
provide
the basis for sound moral judgment and strength of character that would, in a
person with a less disadvantaged history, have
compelled early disclosure to
authorities.  I am satisfied that he was simply a very young man who lacked the
internal resources
to appreciate what he ought to have done, and the avenues
through which he could have taken appropriate action.
<P>

30   	I accept, as was put on the prisoner's behalf, that the
assistance he has promised to give entitles him to a discount of the
highest
order.
<P>

31   	I take into account also that there has been a long delay
since he first admitted his involvement.  Of course, he can gain
no credit for
the period between the commission of the offences and the date of his arrest,
but it is proper to have regard to the
period between November 1996 and
sentencing, a period of almost three years, in which he has plainly matured,
and in which he has
taken significant steps towards rehabilitation.  In this
regard I bear in mind the principles stated by Street CJ in <b>R  v  Todd</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%202%20NSWLR%20517" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 2 NSWLR 517.</a>  Moreover, during the whole of that time he had the threat
of a murder charge hanging over his head.
<P>

32   	In the  ordinary course, having regard to the objective
seriousness of these offences, it is incontestable that a sentence
of full time
custody should be imposed.  I have concluded, however, that, in this case, such
a sentence is not called for.  The factors
which lead me to that conclusion
are:-
<P>

(i)	the very considerable assistance already given and that promised, together
with the risks thereby entailed;
<P>

(ii)	the prisoner's youth at the time of the offence;
<P>

(iii)	his early pleas of guilty;
<P>

(iv)	his demonstrated rehabilitation;
<P>

(v)	the delay (since November 1996) in the finalisation of the proceedings;
<P>

(vi)	the three months the prisoner has already spent in custody, two months of
which were under the more onerous condition of protection,
and the onerous
reporting conditions to which his subsequent grant of bail was subject.
<P>

33   	These factors, in combination, persuade me that, unusually
in a case as objectively serious as this, a sentence to be served
by way of
periodic detention is appropriate.  
<P>

34   	<b>Ronald Lewis Waters</b> you are convicted.  
<P>

35   	On each count you are sentenced to penal servitude for
eighteen months, to be served by way of periodic detention.  The sentences
in
relation to each count are to be served concurrently.  You are to present
yourself at the Metropolitan Periodic Detention Centre
at Parramatta on
Saturday 4 September 1999 by 9.00 am.
