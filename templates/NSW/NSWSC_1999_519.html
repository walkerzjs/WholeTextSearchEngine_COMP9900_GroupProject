<P>

				<b>DALENE LORRAINE BENNETT	</b>

<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Leave to appeal decision of costs assessor)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  The appellant by summons filed 24 February 1999
seeks leave to appeal against the decision of costs assessor, Mr Leonard
Hattersley
made on 10 February 1999 and seeks an order that his decision be set
aside.  The appellant relies on s 208M of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b> 1987
(NSW).  The appellant is the former solicitor of the defendant.  The appellant
relied  on his affidavits sworn 5 November 1997
and 21 April 1999 and the
affidavit of Gillian Player sworn 30 March 1999.  The respondent relied on her
affidavits sworn 5 November
1997 and 16 April 1999.  The respondent was cross
examined.  The appellant sought to call evidence from Mr Boulton a barrister
who
acted for the respondent.  I declined to allow fresh evidence to be called
(see separate judgment).
<P>

2  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208M</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b> 1987 (NSW) (the
Act) provides:
<P>

<b>"(1)	A party to an application relating to a bill of costs may, in
accordance with the rules of the Supreme Court, seek leave of the
Court to
appeal to the Court against the determination of the application made by a
costs assessor.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	A party to an application relating to costs payable as a result of an
order made by a court or a tribunal may, in accordance with
the rules of the
court or tribunal, seek leave of the court or tribunal to appeal to the court
or tribunal against the determination
of the application made by a costs
assessor.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	The Supreme Court or court or tribunal may, in accordance with its
rules, grant leave to appeal and may hear and determine the
appeal.</b>
<P>

<b>(4)	An appeal is to be by way of a new hearing and fresh evidence, or
evidence in addition to or in substitution for the evidence
received at the
original proceedings, may be given."</b>
<P>

3  	In seeking to appeal under s 208M rather than s 208L, the
applicant requires material, other than, or in addition to a point
of law in
order to be successful.  This section provides that such an application
requires leave in accordance with the rules of
the court.
<P>

4  	I have read Master Greenwood's decision in <b><u>Busuttil v
Holder &amp; Anor</u></b> (NSWSC, unreported 9 August 1996).  In particular I
agree with his comments on the applicable test for leave.  He says:
<P>

<b>"Thus whilst each application for leave to appeal is to be determined on its
merits and I heed the statement of the High Court in
Adam P Brown Male Fashions
Pty Ltd v Philip Morris Inc <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20148%20CLR%20170" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 148 CLR 170</a> that it is "unnecessary and
unwise to lay down rigid and exhaustive criteria" for the grant of leave to
appeal, as the circumstances
of different cases are "infinitely various"" I can
see nothing in what is before me that leads me to a conclusion that I ought to
look to the question of leave other than to apply the criteria of an obvious
error on the face of the record and substantial injustice
done to the appellant
if the determination of the costs assessor is allowed to stand."  </b>
<P>

5  	The bill of costs that was assessed covered three areas of legal
work namely the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> application, the proceedings to restrain
the sale of the "Chalet" as an asset in the estate and the requiring of the
executor to
file accounts.  It was common ground between the parties that the
thrust of the respondent's objections to the costs assessor, firstly,
in
relation to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> matter, was that he gave bad advice and
drafted affidavits which contained inadmissible evidence;  secondly, in
relation to the proceedings
to restrain the sale of the "Chalet", the
defendant's brother's solicitor undertook most of the work and thirdly, in
relation to
the requiring of the executor to file accounts, the defendant's
brother's accountant and solicitor undertook most of that work. 
The amount
claimed in the bill of costs was $27,757.25.  The amount allowed by the costs
assessor was $9,848. 
<P>

6  	Not all of the costs assessor's reasons were challenged. It was
not submitted that the appellant had not been given ample opportunity
to
respond to the respondent's submissions to the costs assessor.  To this end the
costs assessor stated that there was much correspondence
going to the basis of
the appellant's retainer and like matters and he had been anxious to ensure
that each of the parties had a
full set of all correspondence which had been
exchanged between each one of them.  
<P>

7  	I had some difficulty with the manner in which the appellant
presented his case.  He directed his questions in cross examination
to the
respondent to certain documents - for example letters from Greaves Wannan and
Williams dated 14 July 1997 and 21 May 1997
(pp 5-8 of bundle of exhibits).  I
have examined the costs assessor's file and copies of these letters do not
appear on file.  However,
there is no correspondence passing between the costs
assessor and the parties on that file. There is no evidence as to what
documents
were actually before the costs assessor except in so far as in the
exhibits to the affidavit of the appellant which contain documents
either
referring to the costs assessment or were addressed to the costs assessor.  The
appellant has not established that letters
from Greaves Wannan and Williams
were ever tendered to the costs assessor so they cannot be taken into account
in the application
for leave to appeal.  The appellant did not make out a case
for these documents to be introduced as fresh evidence.  
<P>

8  	I shall refer to each of the three areas of work to which the
bill relates and the corresponding reasons of the costs assessor
in relation to
each area and then consider whether leave to appeal should be granted.
<P>

9  	In relation to the work carried out in relation to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act</a> matter, the costs assessor in his reasons for determination dated
10 February 1999 stated:
<P>

<b>"It seems to me that the amount of profit costs sought by Mr Player
referrable to the services provided by him in relation to the
conduct of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> claim is approximately $13,700.  Whilst I have considered
each individual charge made by the him in his bill I have come to the view
that
I should not approach the making of his determination of what is a fair and
reasonable amount to be allowed to Mr Player for
his efforts by approving or
disallowing or reducing the costs claimed by him on an item by item basis.  For
example, there are a
vast number of items dealing with work done to create a
number of affidavits filed in the proceedings on behalf of Ms Bennett.  Much
of
the material in those affidavits appears to be inadmissible and irrelevant.  I
have come to the conclusion that it was preferable
that he determine a fair and
reasonable amount by way of a lump sum.</b>
<P>

<b>In relation then to those costs claimed at $13,700.00 I determined that
$7,700.00 is a fair and reasonable amount to be recovered
by him for such
costs.  To that amount is to be added the disbursements of $2,425.75 incurred
by him resulting in the sum of $10,125.75
from which was to be deducted the
amount of $1,754 paid on account by Ms Bennett."</b>
<P>

10  	The appellant did not challenge the costs assessor's method of
lump sum assessment.  In relation to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> matter, it was
common ground that the letter by Mark Boulton dated 5 June 1998 was before the
costs assessor.  Mr Boulton was the
respondent's barrister instructed shortly
before the trial was due to commence in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> matter.  In
that letter Mr Boulton stated that:
<P>

<b>"...</b>
<P>

<b>The defendant's counsel furnished a list of objections to various
affidavits/portions of affidavits.  This document was returned to
Mr Player (I
believe) when I returned the Brief.  I agreed with nearly all of the
objections.  From recollection, the bulk of the
affidavits prepared by </b>
<P>

<b>Mr Player were inadmissible and my firm view was that even if Mrs Bennett
was successful in the case, she would not have been awarded
costs for the
preparation of those affidavits.</b>
<P>

<b>..."</b>
<P>

11  	A copy of the list of objections was before the costs assessor.
The appellant by his letter dated 15 June 1998 put his submissions
in relation
to the affidavit to the costs assessor.  On the evidence before the costs
assessor he was entitled to take the opinion
of the barrister, Mr Boulton into
account.  It was open to the costs assessor to come to the conclusions that he
did.  I see nothing
wrong in the costs assessor's approach in relation to his
assessment of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> component of the bill of costs.
<P>

12  	In relation to the proceedings to restrain the sale of the
"Chalet" the costs assessor stated:
<P>

<b>"I am of the opinion that in the events which occurred - see Reasons for
Judgment of Mr Justice Hulme of 9 December 1994 Ms Bennett
should not be
required to pay the costs incurred by Mr Player in relation to items 78 and 177
inclusive and I have accordingly disallowed
the cost charged for those items in
the sum of $3,719.00.</b>
<P>

<b>It is significant that assuming that Mr Player was entitled to take some
action to recover some part of those costs from the estate
relying upon the
costs order made by Mr Justice Hulme he took no such action.  One could assume
that the benefit of such costs order
had been totally lost by reason of the
estate now having been administered."</b>
<P>

13  	In relation to the Equity proceedings to restrain the sale of
the "Chalet" as an asset of the estate, items 78 to 177 were
disallowed.  These
items relate to costs of the lodging of the caveat and the application before
Hulme J on 9 December 1994.  Gregory
Fox (the respondent's brother) took
proceedings pursuant to s 81 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ta1925122/" class="autolink_findacts">Trustee Act</a></b> 1925(NSW) (as amended)
seeking an order for the removal of a caveat.  The defendant in those
proceedings (and respondent in these
proceedings) is Mrs Bennett.  Hulme J
stated that "the defendant's conduct had been quite unreasonable and that she
was not entitled
to lodge a caveat".  His Honour also considered that the
plaintiff's behaviour fell short of exemplary so ordered the plaintiff to
personally pay the two third of the defendants' costs on the basis of one
representation.
<P>

14  	There is a letter from the respondent addressed to the costs
assessor dated 10 August 1998 where she states that the idea to
lodge a caveat
came from the appellant but he did not discuss with her whether she in fact had
a caveatable interest.  She claimed
that no explanation was given to her by the
solicitor as to what a caveatable interest was and she later learned that she
did not
have one.  The respondent submitted that the solicitor should not be
allowed those costs.  The respondent also made another submission
that her
solicitor's role in the application before Hulme J was minor and her brother's
solicitor had a more active role.  The appellant
put his version of the events
before the costs assessor, although I can only locate the appellant's letter of
21 September 1998 which
does not specifically cover his version of the events
which led to the lodging of a caveat.  It is my view that on the competing
versions of events, the costs assessor was entitled to come to the view that he
did the appellant has not shown that any error has
been made by the costs
assessor.
<P>

15  	However, in relation to the "Chalet" proceedings, the costs
assessor stated that the appellant could have taken some action
to recover the
costs from the estate relying upon the costs order made by Hulme J.  This
statement appears to be incorrect as it
was Mr Gregory Fox who had to
personally pay the costs.  The further statement by the costs assessor that the
benefit of such costs
order had been totally lost by reason of the estate now
having been administered is also incorrect.  The costs assessor's assumption
the estate had been administered is incorrect and is not relevant if the costs
are not to be paid from the estate.  Nevertheless,
I do not regard these
incorrect statements to be material factors that caused the costs assessor's to
deduct the sum of $3,719 but
rather one further reason as to why some costs
claimed should be deducted.  The costs assessor based his decision to deduct
that
sum on the reasoning of Hulme J which I take to mean, His Honour's
findings that there was no caveatable interest.  The costs assessor
accepted
the respondent's submissions that it was her solicitor's decision to adopt this
wrong course and therefore should not be
liable for those costs.
<P>

16  	In relation to the requiring of the executor to file accounts
the costs assessor stated:
<P>

<b>"I am of the opinion that no retainer existed between Ms Bennett and Mr
Player for the performance by him of these services for which
he charged her
substantial fees.  I specifically requested Mr Player to furnish to me
explanations in the terms of numbered paragraph
1 of my letter to him of 17
November 1998.  No explanation was forthcoming from him but Ms Bennett
specifically denied giving such
instructions to him - see her letter to </b>
<P>

<b>me undated by referring to my letter to Mr Player.  Thus I have disallowed
all of those costs claimed by Mr Player dealing with his
intervention into the
estate accounts issues"</b>
<P>

17  	In relation to the requiring of the executor to file accounts,
the costs assessor's reasons are self-explanatory and I cannot
find any error
in his reasoning.
<P>

18  	I have reached the conclusion that there has not been an error
on the face of the record.  I have also come to the same conclusion
after
examining the evidence before the costs assessor that there has been no error
made by him.  The costs assessor deducted $5,000
from the Family Provisions Act
component of the bill, $3,719 from the "Chalet" component of the bill and did
not allow the costs
claimed for requiring the executor to lodge accounts.  Even
if I am wrong in finding that there has been no error in one or more
of these
components of the bill, it is my view that there is no substantial injustice
done to the appellant if the determination
of the costs assessor is allowed to
stand.  It is my view that the appellant having not provided explanations to
the costs assessor
as requested and not having provided the supporting
documentation to the costs assessor now seeks a second hearing to rectify these
short comings.  This course of action is without merit.  For these reasons,
leave to appeal is refused.  The summons is dismissed
with costs.  Costs should
follow the event.
<P>

19  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	Leave to appeal is refused.
<P>

(2)	The summons filed on 24 February 1999 is dismissed.
<P>

(3)	The appellant is to pay the respondent's costs.
