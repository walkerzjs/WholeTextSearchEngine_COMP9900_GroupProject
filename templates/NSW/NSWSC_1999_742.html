<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR : </b>Stanley Clyde Pelzer died on 1 July
1978, having first made and published his last will and testament on 1 December
1971, probate
whereof was granted to the plaintiff on 29 November 1978.
<P>

2   	The will is a strange one in many ways and there is really
no alternative but to set out cll 4 to 7 in full:
<P>

" <u>4.   I GIVE DEVISE AND BEQUEATH</u> the dwelling house in which I am
residing at the time of my death (hereinafter called "my said home") unto my
Trustee <u>UPON TRUST</u>
<P>

 
<P>

(a)  	to permit the said <u>SAIDIE ESTELLE GOLD</u> (hereinafter called "the
Beneficiary") to reside in my said home for so long as she desires so to do
free of any rent or occupation
fee, but the Beneficiary being responsible for
the payment of all rates, taxes and outgoings in respect of my said home and
for keeping
my said home in good repair and insured against fire storm and
tempest, and
<P>

 
<P>

(b)  	at the request and with the consent of the Beneficiary to let my said
home on lease for such term as the Beneficiary and my
Trustees shall agree at
the best rent reasonably obtainable and otherwise on such terms and conditions
as my Trustee thinks fit and
my Trustee shall pay to the Beneficiary the amount
of all rental and premiums (if any) received in respect of the letting of my
said
home, less any management charge to which my Trustee is entitled in
respect of such letting and the Beneficiary shall remain responsible
for the
payment of all rates taxes and outgoings in respect of my said home and for
keeping my said home in good repair and insured
against fire storm and tempest
except to the extent that any or all such responsibilities are undertaken by
any lessee of my said
home, and
<P>

 
<P>

(c)  	at the request and with the consent of the Beneficiary to sell my said
home and to invest the proceeds of sale thereof at
the direction of the
Beneficiary either-
<P>

 
<P>

(i)  	in the purchase of another residence (whether a house, home unit or
otherwise) approved by the Beneficiary which shall be
held by my Trustee upon
and subject to the same trusts as the trusts upon which my said home was held
by my Trustee prior to the
sale thereof, or
<P>

 
<P>

(ii) 	in the purchase in the name of my Trustee from a reputable life assurance
company approved by my Trustee of an annuity upon
and for the life of the
Beneficiary, such annuity to be of the maximum amount which can be purchased
for the amount of such proceeds
of sale having regard to the life expectancy of
the Beneficiary and such annuity shall be payable by quarterly instalments
<u>AND I DECLARE</u> that my Trustee shall stand possessed of such annuity when
purchased <u>UPON TRUST</u> to pay the same to the Beneficiary by quarterly
instalments within ten (10) days from receipt thereof by my Trustee and each
such
payment shall be treated as a payment in advance <u>PROVIDED ALWAYS</u>
that if the Beneficiary shall commit permit or suffer any act default or
process whereby the said annuity or any part thereof would
or might but for
this present provision become vested in or payable to any other person or
persons then such annuity shall immediately
thereupon absolutely cease and
determine as if the Beneficiary were dead and any purchased annuity shall
thenceforth during the life
of the Beneficiary be applied as if this trust had
failed and <u>I DECLARE</u> that the Beneficiary shall not be entitled to
receive the capital value of the said annuity in lieu thereof
<P>

 
<P>

<u>AND I DIRECT</u> my Trustee to apply in accordance with sub-paragraph (ii)
above any part of the proceeds of sale of my said home or any other residence
held by my Trustee upon the same trusts not applied in accordance with
sub-paragraph (i) above.
<P>

 
<P>

<u>5.   I DECLARE</u> that if the Beneficiary shall fail to pay any rates,
taxes and outgoings in respect of my said home or if she shall fail to keep
my
said home in good repair and insured against fire storm and tempest and if such
failure shall continue for a period of three (3)
calendar months from the
giving by my Trustee of written notice to the Beneficiary requiring the
Beneficiary to remedy such failure,
then my Trustee shall have power to sell my
said home and shall apply the proceeds of sale in accordance with sub-paragraph
(ii)
of paragraph (c) of Clause 4 hereof.
<P>

 
<P>

<u>6.   I GIVE DEVISE AND BEQUEST</u> the rest and residue of my real and
personal property of whatsoever kind and wheresoever situate (hereinafter
called "my residuary
Estate") unto my Trustee <u>UPON TRUST</u>
<P>

 
<P>

(a)  	to sell call in and convert into money such part of my residuary Estate
as shall not consist of money and after payment thereout
of my just debts
funeral and testamentary expenses and all death estate and succession duties
both State and Federal in respect of
my estate and subject thereto;
<P>

 
<P>

(b)  	to pay to the Beneficiary the income for the time being arising from any
part of my residuary Estate for the time being unconverted
into money, and
<P>

 
<P>

(c)  	to apply the residue (hereinafter called "my net residuary Estate") in
purchasing in the name of my Trustee from a reputable
life assurance company
approved by my Trustee an annuity upon and for the life of the Beneficiary,
such annuity to be of the maximum
amount which can be purchased for the amount
of my net residuary Estate having regard to the life expectancy of the
Beneficiary and
such annuity shall be payable by quarterly instalments <u>AND I
DECLARE</u> that my Trustee shall stand possessed of such annuity when
purchased <u>UPON TRUST</u> to pay the same to the Beneficiary by quarterly
instalments within ten (10) days from receipt thereof by my Trustee and each
such
payment shall be treated as a payment in advance <u>AND THAT</u> until the
first quarterly instalment of such annuity is paid an amount not exceeding
Three hundred Dollars ($300.00) shall be paid
to the Beneficiary out of the
income and/or capital of my net residuary Estate monthly in advance within ten
(10) days from the first
day of each month commencing with the month following
my death <u>PROVIDED ALWAYS</u> that if the Beneficiary shall commit permit or
suffer any act default or process whereby the said annuity or any part thereof
would
or might but for this present provision become vested in or payable to
any other person or persons then such annuity shall immediately
thereupon
absolutely cease and determine as if the Beneficiary were dead and any
purchased annuity shall thenceforth during the life
of the Beneficiary be
applied as if this trust had failed and <u>I DECLARE</u> that the Beneficiary
shall not be entitled to receive the capital value of the said annuity in lieu
thereof.
<P>

 
<P>

<u>7.   I DECLARE</u> that if the trusts hereinbefore declared shall fail or
shall be treated as having failed my Trustee shall hold my estate and any
purchased annuity no longer payable to the Beneficiary <u>UPON TRUST</u> for
the <u>NEW SOUTH WALES SOCIETY FOR CRIPPLED CHILDREN</u> to be applied for the
general purposes of such Society <u>AND I DECLARE</u> that the receipt of the
Secretary or Treasurer of such Society shall be a full and sufficient discharge
to my Trustee for the same
nor shall my Trustee be obliged to see to the
application thereof."
<P>

3   	The "Beneficiary" referred to in cl 4 of the will lived in
the testator's property at Balgowlah until June 1979 when the property
was sold
for a net amount of just over $68,000. This sum was invested on behalf of the
beneficiary and two years later was used to
purchase a substitute property at
Manly.  The substitute property is probably now worth about $200,000 and is
still held by the plaintiff.
<P>

4   	In addition, the plaintiff holds various sums of money in
its investment funds totalling $244,000, though some of this would
appear to be
rent prior to the death of the beneficiary on 6 March 1994, which might be her
money in any event.  I will just pass
over this complication as it does not
appear that the parties are really in dispute about it.
<P>

5   	What is in dispute is what is to happen to the Manly
property and to the estate's part of the $244,000.
<P>

6   	One can see that if one puts aside all complications that
life can throw up, the testator's general scheme was that the beneficiary
would
live in his house or a substitute house for as long as she liked and unless she
failed to pay the rates, et cetera, which would
cause a premature sale when she
had finished wishing to reside in it, or letting it, the capital fund would be
used to purchase an
annuity.  The  residue of the estate under cl 6 would also
be used to purchase an annuity.
<P>

7   	It should be noted that the annuity is not an annuity in
the orthodox sense, in that there is no sum stipulated as to the amount
of
income that the beneficiary is to receive, rather the whole of the moneys are
to be used to purchase an annuity and, to use the
words of clause 6(c):
<P>

"Such annuity to be of the maximum amount which can be purchased for the amount
of my net residuary Estate having regard to the
life expectancy of my
Beneficiary."
<P>

8   	This indicates that the trustee was to go to an insurance
company, or the like, get a series of quotes for how much money could
be paid
to the beneficiary so that the fund would be exhausted on the death of the
beneficiary.
<P>

9   	Had all that happened, then the probabilities would be that
nothing would be left after the death of the beneficiary.  However,
even on the
most generous view of what might happen in the future, the testator has not
dealt with the situation, at least expressly,
as to what would happen if the
beneficiary should die whilst she was still living in the Balgowlah house or
its substitute.
<P>

10   	The testator has indicated that the beneficiary is not to
be entitled to receive the capital value of the annuity in lieu
thereof.   Ms
Winters, for the representatives of the beneficiary's estate, says that usually
that type of clause is construed as
merely being in terrorem and would not
necessarily operate in order to prevent the capital value passing to the
beneficiary; see<b> Hatton v May </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281876%29%203%20Ch%20D%20148" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1876) 3 Ch D 148</a> and <b>Re Mabbett</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1891%5d%201%20Ch%20707" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1891] 1 Ch 707</a>, 713.  However, that was a very particular type of case and
even if what was there said  was of general application it would still
not
alter the fact that this testator has made it quite clear that the capital is
not to pass to the beneficiary.
<P>

11   	The other matter that will affect the beneficiary's
annuity, or right to reside, is if she permits the annuity to be vested
in or
payable to any other person.  That would include the situation where she
assigned the annuity.  As well, so far as the law
allows, compulsory
assignments on bankruptcy, et cetera would also be included.
<P>

12   	Clause 7 then provides that if the trusts hereinbefore
declared shall fail or shall be treated as having failed then the trustee
is to
hold "my estate and any purchased annuity no longer payable to the beneficiary"
upon trust for the first defendant.
<P>

13   	A few more facts are probably needed before I discuss the
submissions.
<P>

14   	The evidence shows that in 1979 when the Balgowlah house
was sold there was an exchange of correspondence between the trustee
and the
beneficiary in which instead of the proceeds of sale and the residue being used
to purchase an annuity, the funds were used
under cl 8 of the will for
investment.  The upshot is that in fact at the date of the beneficiary's death
there was this $444,000
still in the estate when the testator expected that
there would be nothing.
<P>

15   	In such cases, unless one can construe a residuary clause
very, very widely, the usual effect of an accidental sum of money
being held in
an estate is that the accidental sum passes on as on an intestacy as property
undisposed of  by the will;  see <b>Berry v Geen </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1938%5d%20AC%20575" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1938] AC 575</a>, 582.  Lord
Maugham LC there cites a series of cases mainly dealing with excessive
accumulation under the Thellusson Act.
<P>

16   	In the instant case there is really no residuary gift so
that unless cl 7 operates, or unless there is on the proper construction
of the
will a gift by implication to the beneficiary, the next of kin will take the
surplus.
<P>

17   	The main submissions that have been presented by counsel
for the plaintiff and the second, third and fourth defendants (the
first
defendant submitting) have focussed upon three matters.
<P>

1.  Whether the beneficiary gets personal rights, a life estate or an absolute
gift;
<P>

2.  The meaning of the words "fail or shall be treated as having failed" in
clause 7; and
<P>

3.  The presumption against intestacy.
<P>

18   	1.   It is put that despite the declaration to which I
have referred,  the beneficiary gets an absolute interest.
<P>

19   	I cannot see, despite the very well reasoned submissions
that Ms Winters put both orally and in writing, how the beneficiary
can say
that she had any more than the right to enjoy the residence and the income for
life.
<P>

20   	It seems to me that rules, such as that an indefinite gift
of income carries the capital<b> </b>(<b>Cowan v Larkman</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281888%29%2060%20LT%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1888) 60 LT 1</a>, 3)
have no application in the instant case.  This was not an indefinite gift of
income.  The trustee was told to buy an annuity
for the maximum value based on
the life expectancy of the beneficiary.  Obviously the annuity was only for her
life because otherwise
it would have been quite wrong to have any reference at
all to her life expectancy.
<P>

21   	The matter raised in<b> Hatton v May </b>and
<b>Mabbett's</b> <b>case</b> should not, in my view, be taken as a general rule
but only as a guide to how courts might construe declarations such as are at
the
foot of cll 4 and 6 of this will.  The whole must be read together, and on
reading the whole together, in my view, the beneficiary
did not take an
absolute gift.
<P>

22   	2.   I now have to consider the word "fails".  As Jordan
CJ said in<b> Ingram v Ingram</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1938/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1938] NSWStRp 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%2038%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20407" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1938) 38 SR (NSW) 407</a>, 410 and Kirby P said
in<b> CBS Productions Pty Ltd v O'Neill</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%201%20NSWLR%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 1 NSWLR 601</a>, 608-609, the
word "fails" can have a multitude of meanings.  The prime meanings given by
Kirby P in <b>O'Neill's</b> <b>case</b> were:
<P>

1. Simply the omission to do a thing irrespective of reasons;
<P>

2.  An omission because of some carelessness or delinquency, but not an
omission caused by impossibility; and
<P>

3.  An omission to do a thing, including impossibility.
<P>

When one goes to the will cases one sees other combinations of possible
reasons.
<P>

23   	In<b> Thomson's Trustees v Thomson</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1946%5d%20SLT%20339" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1946] SLT 339</a>
William Thomson entered into a trust in 1939 and then went off to the war where
he was killed.  Accordingly, he died much younger
than he expected and the
trust had to be construed in the light of facts which he may not have had in
mind.  He married three months
before he died.  There was a gift to his widow
and children and then a provision that "should all of these provisions fail"
there
were gifts to his mother.  The court had to consider what was meant by
the words "these provisions" and "fail".
<P>

24   	The choice was between whether the provisions were
incapable of ever having effect or became incapable of ever receiving further
effect.  The court opted for the second interpretation.
<P>

25   	This is reinforced by the approach of Buckley J in<b> Re
Doland's Will Trusts</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%20Ch%20267" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] Ch 267.</a>  In that case the wife of a beneficiary
had witnessed the will and so certain of the trusts did not take effect.  The
will provided
that certain things should happen if any of the trusts failed.
Buckley J held that because the gifts had never taken effect they
never failed,
they just simply had been null and void from the beginning.
<P>

26   	Finally, the Victorian Full Court considered the problem
in<b> Re Pennington</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1972/102.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1972] VicRp 102</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20VR%20869" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] VR 869.</a>  Clause 5 of the will said:
<P>

"In the event of the failure or termination of the aforesaid trusts ...  my
trustee shall hold my residuary estate ... ".
<P>

27   	Anderson J, at first instance, had held that such a clause
was virtually a residuary clause, so that anything that was left
over by the
termination of earlier trusts passed under cl 5.  The Full Court reversed that
view.  Although the Full Court was dealing,
of course, with particular words in
a particular will, it did say at p 874 that to construe cl 5 as operating
virtually as a residuary
clause:
<P>

"would be to depart from the ordinary and natural sense of the testatrix's
language.  The circumstance, therefore, that (counsel's)
construction would
avoid a partial intestacy cannot justify its adoption here ...  ".
<P>

28   	The trend of authorities seems to me that when you find a
clause which operates if trusts fail, one should not be encouraged
in
construing it as a wide ranging residuary clause which picks up property
undisposed of, or property that is left over generally,
but should construe it
more narrowly.
<P>

29   	However, general guidelines as to construction are no
substitute for dealing with the words of the particular will.
<P>

30   	Clause 7 deals with two events, trusts failing or trusts
being treated as having failed.  It is to be noted that there is
no severance.
"Trusts" almost certainly means all the trusts, rather than some of them, and
this is reinforced by the combined expression
"hold my estate and any purchased
annuity".
<P>

31   	It can be seen that the words "shall be treated as having
failed" pick up the proviso in cl 4(c)(ii), and the proviso in cl
6(c), that
is, that the annuity shall cease and be applied as if this trust had failed.
<P>

32   	What is less simple is to work out what the testator meant
by the word "fail".  He may not have meant, if one follows the<b> Thomson</b>
and<b> Doland</b> line of authority, that there was nobody to take because then
the gift never would come into operation.  The deemed failure is dealt
with by
the proviso.  In what other way could there be a failure?
<P>

33   	The only answer that counsel could give to this question
was that there could be some illegality.  It is rather hard to see
how this is
an answer because the only illegality that could come about is if there was
some breach of the Thellusson Act or the
beneficiary became an enemy alien.
<P>

34   	The upshot is, in my view, that one does not follow the
<b>Thomson/Doland</b> line of authority, and the word "fails" must mean fails
to take effect.
<P>

35   	Accordingly, if the trusts do not take effect or cease to
be under the relevant proviso, the trustee is to hold the estate
and the
purchased annuity for the first defendant.
<P>

36   	"My estate" must mean the real property at Balgowlah or
the substitute.  Query whether it also means what happened in the
instant case
where by agreement with the beneficiary the trustee did not buy the annuity,
but instead invested the money and paid
her the income so that there was
capital at the end.  It does not really matter in the long run because the only
time that the first
defendant was to take is in the event of those two
occurrences, neither of which happened.
<P>

37   	3.   The result is that having eliminated the descendants
of the life tenant and the charity, the next of kin should take.
<P>

38   	The court does have a natural reluctance to say that a
testator who has gone to the trouble of making a will has not done
it properly
and has died intestate as to part.  The famous dictum of Lord Esher in<b> Re
Harrison</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281885%29%2030%20Ch%20D%20390" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1885) 30 Ch D 390</a>, 393 was cited, but it is also clear that that
presumption only goes a certain way, and that there being no other rational
solution
that can be obtained from the words the testator has employed, then
the court must give effect to what the testator has done or failed
to do;
see<b> Re Edwards </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1906%5d%201%20Ch%20570" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1906] 1 Ch 570</a>, 574.
<P>

39   	Thus, in my view, the estate, other than the moneys which
I have referred to in passing above, pass to the next of kin.
<P>

40   	Accordingly, I determine that on the true construction of
the last will of Stanley Clyde Pelzer and in the events which have
happened
there is an intestacy in respect of the invested moneys, plus property at 11/3
Osborne Road, Manly.
<P>

41   	I order that the costs of the plaintiff and the costs of
each of the defendants be paid out of the estate of the deceased
on the
indemnity basis and I give liberty to apply.
<P>
