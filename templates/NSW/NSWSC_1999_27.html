Wednesday 10 February 1999
<P>

12818/93	<b>BRUCE DALBY   v   STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  In the course of his cross examination of the plaintiff in these
proceedings, but in the absence of the jury, Mr
Garling of Senior Counsel
sought a ruling as to whether he ought to be allowed to cross examine the
plaintiff about answers he gave
in the course of cross examination on a hearing
at arbitration that preceded this hearing but which related to the same subject
matter
as this cause.  I now publish my reasons for refusing Mr Garling's
application.
<P>

2	In the course of making his submissions Mr Garling referred the Court to
answers which the plaintiff gave in cross examination
before the arbitrator
which were inconsistent with answers that he gave before the jury during the
evidence elicited from him.  Mr
Garling submitted that having regard to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/s43.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 43</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>, 1995 the cross examination contemplated should be
permitted.
<P>

3	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aaa1983261/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 18(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aaa1983261/" class="autolink_findacts">Arbitration (Civil Actions) Act</a></i>, 1983 provides
for finality of the award of an arbitrator, but <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aaa1983261/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 18(2)</a> provides machinery for
a re-hearing if an order is sought for that purpose <i>"by a person aggrieved
by the award"</i>.  In the present case an order was sought and obtained
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aaa1983261/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 18(2)</a> and hence the present proceedings before this Court.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aaa1983261/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 18(3)</a> is of particular significance having regard to the nature of the
present application.  It provides:
<P>

	<i>"Where an order is made under sub-section (2):</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	the award that gave rise to the order ceases to have effect; and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	...the action to which the order relates shall be heard and determined
in the Court </i><cite>as if it had never been referred to an
arbitrator</cite><i>."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>(Emphasis added)
<P>

4	My attention was drawn to an unreported decision of Finlay J in <i>Najdavonic
v Brown</i> (22 September 1992) in which his Honour held that the effect of
sub-s (3) was to prevent either party on a re-hearing from <i>"using any of the
material, including the transcript of evidence, before the arbitrator (unless,
of course, by consent to facilitate
the hearing)"</i>.  
<P>

5	That decision was considered in the Court of Appeal by Priestley A-P in
<i>Macdougall &amp; Anor v Curlevski</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%20430" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR 430.</a>  Whilst his
observations in <i>Macdougall</i> were strictly obiter, his Honour tentatively
expressed his concurrence with the ruling of Finlay J.
<P>

6	I have had the advantage of considering the reasons for the decision reached
by Finlay J on 22 September 1992.  His Honour referred
to the Second Reading
Speech that preceded but related to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aaa1983261/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 18(3)</a> of the statute.  What the Attorney
General said about that sub-section was this:
<P>

	<i>"The third proposal also relates to re-hearings.  It is a practical
requirement of the system that on a re-hearing the court must
have no regard to
anything that happened on the arbitration and, in general terms, the Act says
so.  The intent has been always that
the introduction of compulsory arbitration
should not frustrate the right of a party to insist on ultimately getting the
action fully
heard in the court in which it was commenced."</i>
<P>

7	It seems to me that it would be contrary to the objective expressed by the
Attorney General and to the language of the sub-section
itself if the plaintiff
could now be cross-examined about evidence that he gave before the arbitrator.
The language of sub-s (3)
is plain.  This hearing is to proceed as though the
action <i>"had never been referred to an arbitrator"</i>.  If the defendant was
to be permitted to cross examine the plaintiff in the way in which it wishes to
cross examine the plaintiff,
sub-s (3) in my opinion would be contravened.
<P>

8	I respectfully agree with the ruling of Finlay J in <i>Najdanovic</i> and
having regard to the language of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aaa1983261/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 18(3)</a> I do not permit Mr Garling to cross
examine the plaintiff about evidence he gave on the arbitration proceedings.
