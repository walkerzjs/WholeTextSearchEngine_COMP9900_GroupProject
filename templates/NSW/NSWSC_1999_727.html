OF NEW SOUTH WALES

EQUITY DIVISION - COMMERCIAL LIST

EINSTEIN J
<P>

Sydney 3 August 1999
<P>

55062 of 1997 <b>- </b>P. Ward Civil Engineering Pty Limited v Civil and Civic
Pty Limited 
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>The Dispute</b>
<P>

1   	These proceedings relate to a dispute concerning the
earthworks component for the construction of the Prospect Water Filtration
Plant (`the project') from 1993 to 1996.  The defendant, Civil and Civic Pty
Limited [now known as Lend Lease Property Services Pty
Limited] (`Civil and
Civic'), was the design and construct contractor for that plant.  The
plaintiff, P. Ward Civil Engineering Pty
Limited [`Wards'], was Civil and
Civic's earthworks subcontractor.
<P>

2   	Wards claim is detailed in the further amended summons
(`the summons') filed on 21 June 1999.  That claim includes claims for
variations, delay and disruption costs.  Those matters are to be the subject of
a reference before Mr Kenneth Hinds at a date yet
to be determined. 
<P>

3   	The matters to be determined in the present hearing are
contained in the document entitled `Questions for Separate Determination',
these being attached to the order for reference made pursuant to Part 72 of the
Rules.  Eleven identified questions are before the
Court and these are set out
below.  It is, however, first appropriate to set out the background to the
proceedings.
<P>

4   	On 18 May 1994, a formal Subcontract (`the Subcontract'),
was executed between Civil and Civic as head contractor and Wards
as
subcontractor.  The Subcontract was executed following communications both oral
and in writing passing between the parties from
early 1992.
<P>

5   	In essence, the case brought by Civil and Civic is that in
late 1993, some six months earlier, the parties had become bound
to an
enforceable agreement providing:
<P>

(a)	that the plaintiff would carry out certain excavation, construction and
associated work at the plant for a lump sum price of
$16.7million;
<P>

(b)	that the works would be carried out upon the terms and conditions provided
with Civil and Civic's letter to Wards of 3 August
1993;
<P>

(c)	that the agreement would be recorded in a formal written Subcontract
incorporating the terms of the agreement and any additional
or alternative
terms agreed upon between the parties.
<P>

[I note that notwithstanding the terms of the summons which pleaded the date of
the agreement as in or about December 1993, Wards
Senior Counsel opened the
case by identifying the date on which the alleged agreement was entered into as
17 November 1993, on which
basis the hearing proceeded]
<P>

6   	Civil and Civic denies this allegation and asserts that the
18 May 1994 Subcontract constituted the agreement between the parties
for the
carrying out of the relevant works.  Civil and Civic accepts that an earlier
contract described by Civil and Civic as a contract
`for early works' of 7
February 1994 had been entered into between the parties, which contract is said
to have fallen away when the
May 1994 Subcontract was entered into.
<P>

7   	The issues presently before the Court largely relate to
Ward's allegations that as a result of the conduct of Civil and Civic
in
relation to the execution of the Subcontract, it has avoided the Subcontract or
is entitled to other relief under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></i> or by way of
rectification or as otherwise described below.
<P>

8   	It is common ground that the Prospect Water Filtration
Plant was one of four water filtration plants tendered by the New south
Wales
Government in 1993/94 on a build, own, operate and transfer [`BOOT'] basis.  It
is common ground that a partnership comprising
Lend Lease Corporation, P &amp;O
and Lyonnaise Des Eaux (`the partnership') was awarded the BOOT Contract for
the Prospect Plant.
<P>

9   	Also common ground is the fact that Civil and Civic was
involved with the partnership during the Government tender period in
developing
designs and providing pricing information to the partnership which was used in
formulating the partnership's bid to Sydney
Water.  The partnership, on about
20 September 1993 [T443], entered into a contract with Civil and Civic for the
design and construction
of the plant.
<P>

10   	It is common ground that Civil and Civic decided to divide
the project into four main Subcontractor areas of works.  These
included Wards
for the majority of the earthworks package and John Holland Civil Engineering
Pty Limited (`John Hollands') for the
structures package.
<P>

11   	The summons identifies alleged outstanding claims for
payment for works purportedly performed under the Subcontract in an
amount of
$6,029,586.  Paragraph 3 of section A of the summons asserts that Wards' claims
have been rejected partly for reasons that
Wards' claim for payment for
variations were included in the scope of works within the Subcontract.  Wards
here asserts that `the
plaintiff's claims for variations are excluded as
"design development" within the meaning of that expression in the Subcontract'.
Although not the only issue, this issue recurs as a matter of obviously
critical moment to both parties.
<P>

12   	The summons, inter alia, alleges that `the defendant made
misleading misrepresentations regarding the process of `design development'
[paragraph 5 of section A].
<P>

<b>The Pleadings and the Questions for Separate Determination</b>
<P>

13   	Wards claim in the summons the following relief:
<P>

<i>`1.	A declaration that the agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant
for the carrying out of excavation, construction and
associated works at the
site known as the Prospect Water Filtration Plant (`the Agreement') is:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	for the completion of the works referred to in the plaintiff's priced
bill of quantities dated 19 November 1993 as further described
in the
defendant's document entitled `scope of works' dated 12 July 1993 and the
drawings referred to in the enclosures to the letter
to the plaintiff dated 3
August 1993 for a lump sum price of $16.7million;  and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	upon the terms and conditions provided with the defendant's . . .
letter of 3 August 1993.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	An order rectifying the Subcontract executed by the plaintiff on 17 May
1994 (`the Subcontract') so as to properly record the Agreement.</i>
<P>

<i>3.	Alternatively, an order pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 87</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act
1974</a> (Commonwealth) varying the Subcontract so as to properly record the
Agreement.</i>
<P>

<i>4.	Alternatively, damages, equitable damages or compensation pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 82</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>.</i>
<P>

<i>5.	Further, judgment for an amount of $6,029,586 in respect of moneys
outstanding pursuant to the Agreement or, alternatively, the
Subcontract or,
alternatively, as a quantum meruit.</i>
<P>

<i>6.	Interest.</i>
<P>

<i>7.	Costs . . .'</i>
<P>

14   	Wards' contentions set out in section C of the amended
summons, put the plaintiff's case under a number of heads.  The range
of relief
sought was slightly expanded in final submissions later referred to.  The
section C contentions are as follows:
<P>

<b>Alleged Agreement of December 1993</b>
<P>

<i>`2.	In or about December 1993 the Plaintiff and Defendant agreed:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	that the Plaintiff would carry out certain excavation, construction and
associated work described in the Plaintiff's priced bill
of quantities dated 19
November 1993 (`the Works') which works were further described in the
Defendant's document entitled `Scope
of Works' dated 12 July 1993 and the
drawings referred to in the enclosures to the Defendant's letter to the
Plaintiff dated 3 August
1993, at the site known as the Prospect Water
Filtration Plant (`the site') for a lump sum price of $16.7m (`the
Agreement');</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	that the Works would be carried out upon the terms and conditions
provided with the Defendant's said letter of 3 August 1993;
 and</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	that the Agreement would be recorded in a formal written Subcontract
incorporating the terms of the Agreement and any additional
or alternative
terms agreed upon between the parties.</i>
<P>

<b><i>Particulars</i></b>
<P>

<i>The agreement arises from the following communications and
circumstances:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	Letter from the Defendant to the Plaintiff dated 3 August 1993.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	Letter from the Plaintiff to the Defendant dated 23 August 1993.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	Letter from the Plaintiff to the Defendant dated 20 September
1993.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	Letter from the Plain6iff to the Defendant dated 26 September
1993.</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	Letter from the Plaintiff to the Defendant dated 11 November
1993.</i>
<P>

<i>(f)	Letter from the Plaintiff to the Defendant dated 17 November
1993.</i>
<P>

<i>(g)	The meetings between representatives of the Plaintiff and
representatives of the Defendant on 3 September, 6 September, 10 September,
20
September, 23 September, 27 September and 5 October 1993 minuted by the
Defendant as Construction Engineering Meetings Numbers
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7
respectively.</i>
<P>

<i>(h)	the request by the Defendant on about 1 December 1993 that the Plaintiff
commence work on the project immediately;</i>
<P>

<i>(hh)	Requests by the Defendant between 1 December 1993 and 16 May 1994 that
the Plaintiff commence work on the project additional
to the works the subject
of;</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	the Defendant's letter of Intent for early works dated 6 December
1993;</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	the Defendant's Purchase Order 21033;  and</i>
<P>

<i>(iii)	the contract between the Plaintiff and the Defendant dated 7 February
1994.</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	The commencement by the Plaintiff of the Works on about 9 December
1993.'</i>
<P>

15   	Question 11 of the questions for separate determination
reads:
<P>

<i>'11.	Is the plaintiff entitled to a declaration as claimed in paragraph 1 of
the amended summons?'</i>
<P>

Hence, question 11 treats with the principal claim and first matter raised by
the plaintiff's further amended summons in relation
to the alleged November
1993 agreement.
<P>

<b>May 1994 Subcontract</b>
<P>

16   	Paragraphs 3 to 5 inclusive of the contentions are in the
following terms:
<P>

<i>`3.	In or about May 1994, the Defendant informed the Plaintiff that it would
not pay the Plaintiff's outstanding progress claims until
it signed a formal
contract for the Works, which contract was in the process of being prepared. On
or about 16 May 1994, the Defendant
informed the Plaintiff that the contract
was available for execution.</i>
<P>

<i>4.	On 17 May 1994, David Knight on behalf of the Defendant presented to
Glenn Cherrie on behalf of the Plaintiff a written Subcontract,
(`the
Subcontract') and informed Mr Cherrie that proposed changes to the Subcontract
were not to be proceeded with.  Mr Cherrie executed
the Subcontract on behalf
of the Plaintiff in the presence of Mr Knight.</i>
<P>

<i>5.	The scope of works and terms and conditions in the Subcontract were
materially different to those agreed in November 1993.'</i>
<P>

<b>Unilateral Mistake - <i>Taylor v Johnson</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20151%20CLR%20422" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 151 CLR 422</a></b>
<P>

17   	Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the contentions are in the following
terms:
<P>

<i>`6.	At the time of its execution of the Subcontract, the Plaintiff
mistakenly believed that the scope of works and terms and conditions
incorporated in the Subcontract were identical with or, alternatively, not
inconsistent with, the scope of works and terms and conditions
incorporated in
the Agreement.</i>
<P>

<i>7.	At the time of the Plaintiff's execution of the Subcontract, the
Defendant was aware or, alternatively, ought reasonably to have
been aware, of
the Plaintiff's mistaken belief referred to in paragraph 6.</i>
<P>

<b><i>Particulars</i></b>
<P>

<i>The Defendant was aware that the price for the Works was the same as that
provided in the Agreement and that all agreed variations
to the scope of the
work since November 1993 had been the subject of variation claims by the
Plaintiff (which had been agreed to
by the Defendant).  The Defendant was aware
that no other variations to the Agreement had been agreed and that no one on
behalf of
the Defendant had informed the Plaintiff that the scope of works or
terms and conditions of the Subcontract were different to those
incorporated in
the Agreement.'</i>
<P>

18   	Both questions 1 and 5 of the questions for determination
are relevant to the plaintiff's mistake case.  Question 1 reads:
<P>

<i>`Was the Subcontract between the Plaintiff and the Defendant dated 17 May
1994 affected by mistake?'</i>
<P>

19   	Question 5 reads:
<P>

<i>`Is the Plaintiff entitled to an order rectifying the Subcontract so
that:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the scope of works to be undertaken under the Subcontract is as
described in the documents referred to in paragraph 2(a) of the
Contentions
and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the terms and conditions of the Subcontract correspond with those
referred to in sub-paragraph 2(b) of the Contentions?'</i>
<P>

<b>Avoidance of Subcontract</b>
<P>

20   	Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the contentions are in the following
terms:
<P>

<i>`8.	In or about February 1995, the Plaintiff first learned of the mistake
referred to in paragraph 6 and thereafter communicated to
the Defendant its
refusal to be bound by the terms of the Subcontract insofar as they were
inconsistent with the Agreement.</i>
<P>

<i>9.	By reason of the matters alleged in paragraphs 2 to 8, the Subcontract
has been avoided.'</i>
<P>

21   	Question 3 of the questions for separate determination
deals with the question of avoidance and is in the following terms:
<P>

<i>`3.	Has the Subcontract been avoided by the Plaintiff and if so
when?'</i>
<P>

<b>Rectification</b>
<P>

22   	Paragraph 10 of the contentions is in the following
terms:
<P>

<i>`Alternatively, by reason of the matters alleged in paragraphs 2 to 5, the
Subcontract does not record the Agreement and the Plaintiff
is entitled to an
order rectifying or alternatively avoiding the Subcontract.'</i>
<P>

23   	Question 5 of the questions for separate determination
dealing with rectification has already been set out.
<P>

<b>First <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> Count (`The Representation')</b>
<P>

24   	Paragraphs 11 to 13 inclusive of the contentions are in
the following terms:
<P>

<i>`Further, or in the alternative, by presenting the Subcontract to the
Plaintiff for its execution in the circumstances particularised
in paragraphs
2,3,4,5 and/or 7 above, and by its failure to inform the Plaintiff that the
scope of works and the terms and conditions
incorporated in the Subcontract
were different to those incorporated in the Agreement, the Defendant:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	represented that the scope of works and terms and conditions
incorporated in the Subcontract were not materially different to
or,
alternatively, not inconsistent with the scope of works and terms and
conditions incorporated in the Agreement (`the Representation');
 and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	engaged in conduct that was misleading or deceptive in contravention of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>.</i>
<P>

<i>12.	In reliance upon the Representation and/or the misleading conduct
referred to in paragraph 11, the Plaintiff executed the Subcontract.</i>
<P>

<i>13.	Further or in the alternative, if the Plaintiff is bound by the terms of
the Subcontract, then by reason of the Plaintiff's execution
of the
Subcontract, it has suffered loss and damage.</i>
<P>

<b><i>Particulars</i></b>
<P>

<i>The scope of works incorporated in the Subcontract was greater than the
scope of works incorporated in the Agreement and the Defendant
has refused the
Plaintiff's variation claims insofar as the claims seek additional payment for
work not incorporated in the Agreement
but incorporated in the
Subcontract.'</i>
<P>

<b>Second <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> Count (`The Further Representations')</b>
<P>

25   	Paragraphs 14 to 19 of the contentions are in the
following terms:
<P>

<i>'14.	Further or in the alternative, in the period between July 1993 and May
1994 the Defendant represented to the Plaintiff:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	that the relationship between the Plaintiff and Defendant in connection
with the construction of the Works would be in the nature
of a partnership and
that they would co-operate to ensure that the project was a financial success
for both the Plaintiff and the
Defendant;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	that the Plaintiff would be given the opportunity to participate in the
development of the design of the Works and that its participation
would result
in cost savings and increased profit to the Plaintiff;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	that the Defendant would control the design consultants engaged in the
project and could and would ensure the design development
process reduced the
cost to the Plaintiff of completing the Works;</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	that the reduced cost of the works and increased profit to the Plaintiff
as a result of design development would be in the order
of $1m;  and</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	that if the Plaintiff reduced its price for the works by $600,000.00 the
Defendant would ensure that the Plaintiff's Subcontractors
reduced their prices
by about $410,000.00.</i>
<P>

<b><i>Particulars</i></b>
<P>

<i>The representations referred to in sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) were made in
the course of a number of discussions between Terry Delahunty
and Greg Robinson
on behalf of the Defendant and Peter Ward and Mr Cherrie on behalf of the
Plaintiff, including discussions in July
1993 and on 15 November 1993 and 19
February 1994.</i>

<i>The representation referred to in sub-paragraph (e) was made in the course
of discussions between Mr Robinson and Mr Cherrie on or
about 15 November

Representations are deemed to be misleading unless the Defendant proves it has
reasonable grounds for making
them.</i>

<i>16.	Each of the Further Representations was false.</i>

<b>Overview of the respective cases</b>
<P>

38   	It is particularly difficult in a case such as the
present, to give any sensible overview of the two parties' contentions
without
first reciting the detailed material facts.  It is, however, useful to
immediately set out the terms of a letter of 3 August
1993 from Civil and Civic
to Wards which makes plain, particularly in paragraphs 5 and 6, the case put by
Civil and Civic as to the
contractual regime at all material times suggested by
Civil and Civic as having been intended by it and asserted by Civil and Civic,
but denied by Wards, to have been included in due course, in the May 1994
Subcontract as signed by the parties.  That regime deals
with the concepts of
reaching a `Target Guaranteed Maximum Price' and later a `Guaranteed Maximum
Price' separated by what is referred
to in some of the documents as a `Price
Validation Period'.  These expressions will from time to time be referred to in
the Judgment
as `TGMP, `GMP' and `PVP'.  The letter, particular phrases of
which were closely examined in cross-examination of witnesses, is in
the
following terms:
<P>

<i>`[1]  As part of the preferred Subcontractor relationship established
between Civil &amp; Civic and P Ward Civil Engineering during
the Bid phase,
you are hereby invited to prepare a Target Guaranteed Maximum Price (TGMP)
proposal consistent with the attached Table
of Contents for the attached scope
of works.  The final break-up of the works may vary from this current scope.
We draw to your attention
that some elements of this scope are optional and may
not ultimately be included.</i>
<P>

<i>[2]  Your TGMP proposal should reflect the current design intent as well as
anticipated savings or other initiatives that you believe
can be achieved
through your participation in the design development process.  Your proposal
should outline the nature of any design
issues that you may wish to explore
during design development.</i>
<P>

<i>[3]  We believe that given the opportunity to participate in design
development, particularly in the areas of construction technique
and
buildability, you should be able to influence the design so that time and cost
savings are achieved without compromising the
quality of the end product or its
compliance with the contract specification.</i>
<P>

<i>[4]  Considerations in assessing your TGMP proposal will also include your
ability to meet, or better, the current construction programme,
your Workplace
Reform initiatives, standards of Quality, Safety and Environmental Management,
and Commercial competitiveness.</i>
<P>

<i>[5]  If your TGMP proposal is acceptable you will be asked to continue the
relationship with us and participate in the design development
process.  During
this process you will be required to examine your TGMP and confirm it as a
Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) over a
several month period.  Any benefit added
by Wards Engineering in this period would remain to their advantage.  Any
benefit added
by Civil &amp; Civic would be deducted from the TGMP at an agreed
value.  Pursuant to a result at this stage which is to the satisfaction
of
Civil &amp; Civic, your GMP will form the basis of a Partnership agreement for
the relevant works and services.</i>
<P>

<i>[6]  </i><cite>If we contract with you, any risk(s) associated with further
design development are to be borne by you within the GMP unless major
changes
to scope are required by the client for which additional funds are made
available to Civil &amp; Civic under the head Contract</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>[7]  It is agreed between our two parties that should your proposal(s) at
any time up to acceptance of TGMP, be considered unsatisfactory
to Civil &amp;
Civic either in terms of price or content, we reserve the right, at our sole
discretion, to source either part or
all of the works from other
subcontractors.</i>
<P>

<i>[8]  The documents included with this invitation are listed overleaf.
Should you require any assistance in preparing your proposal,
please contact
the Team Leader for this Work Area, Mr Greg Robinson.  Thank you for your
assistance to date.</i>
<P>

<i>[9]  We look forward to your favourable response.'  [Emphasis added]</i>
<P>

[Although the paragraphs were not numbered in the letter as admitted into
evidence, it is convenient to refer to the paragraphs
as if so enumerated.]
<P>

39   	The letter following earlier correspondence inviting Wards
to submit a tender, included a draft contract and a scope of works,
on which
Wards asserts that its later offer was based.
<P>

<b>Wards' Contentions</b>
<P>

40   	Wards asserts that over several months the extent of the
scope of works and the consequent price of those works was the subject
of
discussion, negotiation and agreement between the parties.  Wards asserts that
during that time, the scope of the works to be
undertaken by Wards and the
contract price for each element of the works were the subject of extensive and
detailed discussions.
 Wards asserts that each proposed scope was the subject
of a detailed price schedule which identified with particularity, the extent
of
work to be undertaken and its costing.  Wards assert that this process
culminated in Civil and Civic offering a target contract
price of $16.7m.
<P>

41   	Wards then asserts that by letter of 17 November 1993, it
accepted the target price (said by Wards to have been `formally'
known as the
TGMP) and attached a bill of quantities which is said to have reflected the
agreed value for the scope of works.  The
bill of quantities was entitled
`TGMP/D' and will be so described in the Judgment.
<P>

42   	Wards asserts that it was contemplated that a period of
discussion would then take place over a number of weeks during which
the TGMP
was to be converted to a GMP (or contract price).  Wards asserts that it was
its understanding that during this period of
time, the proposals of Wards and
other parties for amendments to the design would be discussed and either
approved or rejected by
the designers.  Wards asserts that it was also
anticipated that the design of the works would be substantially completed.
Wards asserts
that although some discussion of design issues occurred, the
contemplated process for conversion from TGMP to GMP was not brought
to any
conclusion and did not progress meaningfully.
<P>

43   	Wards then asserts that in December 1993 at the request of
Civil and Civic, it commenced work.  The 7 February 1994 interim
contract (with
a value of approximately $1.5m), was signed.  Wards asserts that this interim
contract was signed `so that the defendant's
administrative requirements of a
contract being in place before payments could be made were satisfied' and that
it assumed that the
interim contract was in the same terms as the August draft
contract.
<P>

44   	Wards then refer to the execution on 18 May 1994 of the
formal contract for the lump sum of $16.7m.  Ward asserts that at
that time, as
a result of Civil and Civic's administrative requirements, payments had ceased
for work that had been performed in
excess of the interim contract work.  Wards
asserts that no Wards officer or employee read the contract as it was assumed
that it
was in the same terms as the August draft contract and contained the
scope of works the subject of the November 1993 acceptance.
 Ward asserts that
the administrative requirements, having been fulfilled by the contract being
signed, a further payment was made
to it on the following day.  
<P>

45   	Wards asserts that at no time did Civil and Civic advise
Wards that it was altering the terms and conditions contained in
the August
draft contract (other than to include a term referring to the partnering
agreement) or that it was drafting a new scope
of works document which changed
the work to be performed by Wards for the sum of $16.7m.
<P>

46   	Wards relies on a number of documents which passed between
the parties during the negotiations and in the course of which
it is common
ground that Civil and Civic made statements representing an intent to achieve
some form of partnering agreement in relation
to aspects of the works.
<P>

47   	Hence, Wards asserts that prior to the execution of the
final contract, the parties were the subject of a partnering charter
under
which Wards understood the works were to be managed.  In consequence, so Wards
asserts, the differences in the contract were
not apparent to Wards until
February 1995, after there had been disagreement about the entitlement of Wards
to money for variation
claims.
<P>

48   	Wards then asserts that the contract executed on 18 May
1994 was materially different from the August draft contract in the
following
two respects:
<P>

(a)	There are said to have been significant changes to the general terms and
conditions.
<P>

(b)	The scope of works referred to in the contract is said to have been in
excess of that which the parties had agreed upon.
<P>

49   	Wards asserts that it immediately notified Civil and Civic
of the mistake and communicated its refusal to be bound by the
terms of the
contract insofar as they were inconsistent with the agreement reached on 17
November 1993 (which is said to have taken
into account the August draft
document, the negotiations which occurred and the documents which the parties
sent to each other between
then and 17 November 1993).
<P>

50   	Wards assert that the effect of those changes is largely
that under the executed contract Wards would be required to undertake
significant work in excess of that which it valued at $16.7m for no reward.
<P>

51   	In overview submissions, Wards outlined the appropriate
principles of law on which its case is centrally grounded in the following
terms:
<P>

<i>`</i><b><cite>Unilateral Mistake</cite></b>
<P>

<i>13.	A party who has entered into a written contract under a serious mistake
about its contents in relation to a fundamental term will
be entitled in equity
to an order rescinding the contract if the other party is aware that
circumstances exist which indicate that
the first party is entering the
contract under some serious mistake or misapprehension about either the content
or subject matter
of that term and deliberately sets out to ensure that the
first party does not become aware of its mistake or misapprehension (Taylor
v.
Johnson <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20151%20CLR%20422" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 151 CLR 422).</a></i>
<P>

<i>14.	In those circumstances, the contract should be rescinded by virtue of
the Defendants silence in circumstances where it knew, or
ought to have known
that the Plaintiff was entering into it on the basis of a fundamental
misapprehension of its terms and effect
(Taylor v. Johnson) and the Plaintiff
should be entitled to a quantum meruit (Pavey &amp; Matthews Proprietary
Limited v. Paul</i> <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20162%20CLR%20221" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 162 CLR 221).</a></i>
<P>

<i>15.	Alternatively, as the mistake in the document was known to the
Defendant, who kept silent about it in circumstances where the
mistake was to
its advantage, the contract should be rectified so as to properly record the
Agreement (Johnston v. Arnaboldi  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%202%20Qd%20R%20138" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] 2 Qd R. 138).</a></i>

<P>

<i>16.	If circumstances are such that a person is entitled to believe that a
relevant matter affecting him or her would, if it existed,
be communicated,
then the failure to communicate it may constitute conduct which is misleading
or deceptive because the person who
ultimately may act to his or her detriment
is entitled to infer from the silence that no danger or detriment existed

<P>

<i>17.	By failing to inform the Plaintiff of the changes in the terms and

<P>

<b>Civil and Civic's Contentions</b>
<P>

52   	Civil and Civic submit that Wards is not entitled to a
declaration as claimed in paragraph 1 of the summons because as at
November and
December 1993, the only agreement reached between Wards and Civil and Civic was
in respect of a price of a TGMP and
the commencement of a design development
process by which that TGMP would be converted into a lump sum GMP contract in
the sum of
$16.7m.  Civil and Civic then asserts that this process was not
concluded until the acceptance of the GMP sum of $16.7m and the formal
execution of the Subcontract on 18 May 1994.
<P>

53   	Central to Civil and Civic's case is a very close analysis
of the documents which passed between the parties and a close examination
of
what is suggested to have been the agreement whereby Wards would participate in
the process of design development.  Design development
is said by Civil and
Civic to have been an integral and essential part of the process occurring
between the invitation to Wards to
submit a TGMP on 3 August 1993 and the
submission of Wards' revised TGMP of $16.7m on 17 November 1993.
<P>

54   	Civil and Civic assert that the process of design
development was clear from its letter of 3 August 1993, was also ongoing
after
a TGMP was accepted until the point at which a GMP was agreed and reduced to a
formal lump sum contract price.  Civil and Civic
assert that at the point at
which a GMP contract was executed, the risk on design development as well as
the benefits of design development
then became the responsibility of Wards.
<P>

55   	Civil and Civic thus contend that as at 17 November 1993,
the parties had agreed on a price of a TGMP and a further process
of design
development.
<P>

56   	Civil and Civic assert that the process of design
development was also part of the conversion of Wards' TGMP of $16.7million
into
a GMP in that sum.  Civil and Civic assert that the culmination of that process
was the signing of a lump sum GMP contract for
$16.7million which occurred on
18 May 1994.
<P>

57   	Civil and Civic take the Court through many documents
which it is suggested by way of contemporaneous record of the communications
between the parties, makes quite plain that Wards' case is totally
misconceived.  The essential question from Civil and Civic's perspective
involves identifying what were the terms of any agreement entered into between
the parties as at either 17 November 1993 or December
1993 and, of course, as
at 18 May 1994.
<P>

58   	Civil and Civic submitted that the answer to question 11
dealing with the alleged agreement is in the negative.
<P>

59   	In relation to mistake, Civil and Civic submit that any
mistake by the Plaintiff was unilateral.  The mistake as characterised
by
Wards, is said by Civil and Civic to have been occasioned solely by the
carelessness of each of the two directors of Wards who
signed the Subcontract
documents of 7 February 1994 and 18 May 1994.  Civil and Civic make the point
that the carelessness of Wards'
directors (if accepted) is sought to be excused
by an alleged failure on the part of Civil and Civic to inform Wards that the
scope
of works and the terms and conditions of the Subcontract of 18 May 1994
were different to those which are said to constitute the
agreement of November
or December 1993.
<P>

60   	Civil and Civic assert that the plaintiff's
characterisation of the evidence ignores the following:
<P>

(i)	the suggested patently different nature of the material which is said to
constitute the alleged agreement of November or December
1993, namely
correspondence and minutes of meetings, compared to the form and nature of the
Subcontract document of 18 May 1994;
<P>

(ii)	the fact that the only agreement reached in November or December 1993
related, so it is said, to the acceptance of a TGMP of
$16.7million and not a
contract or agreement to perform works;
<P>

(iii)	the legal arrangements upon which the plaintiff performed its works after
November and December 1993 which comprised the letter
of intent of 6 December
1993, the Purchase Order of December 1993 and the 7 February 1994 early works
subcontract (as amended by
three Order Amendments).
<P>

61   	In short, for these and a number of other reasons, Civil
and Civic assert that the answer to question 1 is in the negative,
namely that
the Subcontract of 18 May 1994 was not affected by mistake.  It follows that
Civil and Civic also submit that the answer
to question 5 in relation to
whether the plaintiff is entitled to an order rectifying the Subcontract, is in
the negative.
<P>

62   	As to question 3, Civil and Civic generally denies any
mistake and denies that Wards first learned of any mistake as alleged
in or
about February 1995.
<P>

63   	Civil and Civic also denies that Wards ever communicated
to it its refusal to be bound by the terms of the Subcontract insofar
as they
were inconsistent with the alleged agreement.
<P>

64   	Civil and Civic point out that many of the questions for
separate determination overlap.
<P>

65   	Civil and Civic contend that by its conduct, Wards
affirmed the terms of the Subcontract and represented to it that it would
not
avoid or otherwise impugn the terms of the Subcontract on the basis of any
alleged differences between the terms of the Subcontract
and the terms of the
alleged 1993 agreement.  That conduct, said to constitute that affirmation, is
said to have included:
<P>

<i>(i)	signing the early works Subcontract on 7 February 1994;</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	signing the Subcontract on 18 May 1994;</i>
<P>

<i>(iii)	failing and refusing to express any intention not to be bound by the
terms of the Subcontract;</i>
<P>

<i>(iv)	continuing to perform works after becoming aware on or about February
1995 (at the latest) that the terms of the Subcontract
were the terms upon
which Civil and Civic required Wards to perform its works.</i>
<P>

66   	Civil and Civic assert that Wards cannot now seek to
retrospectively avoid the Subcontract.
<P>

67   	As to the alleged misrepresentations, Civil and Civic
assert that Wards has not, on the evidence, established that Civil and
Civic
was aware of circumstances by which it knew Wards was entering the Subcontract
of 18 May 1994 under `some serious mistake or
misapprehension', or that Civil
and Civic `deliberately set out to ensure that the plaintiff did not become
aware of its mistake
or misapprehension'.
<P>

68   	In asserting a negative to question 3, which asks whether
the Subcontract had been avoided by Wards, Civil and Civic submit
that Wards
affirmed and remained bound by the terms of the Subcontract by its failure to
immediately seek to be relieved of the Subcontract
upon first becoming aware of
any alleged mistake as to its terms.
<P>

69   	As to the misleading and deceptive conduct cases raised by
questions 2, 7 and 9, Civil and Civic repeats its case on the issue
of
rectification.  It submits that the pleaded allegations of misleading and
deceptive conduct each suffer from the same fundamental
defect in that Wards at
no time relied upon any of the alleged representations or further
representations, even if it is found by
the Court on the evidence that Civil
and Civic made those representations.
<P>

70   	As to the representation that the scope of works and terms
and conditions in the Subcontract of 18 May 1994 were different
to those in the
November or December 1993 agreement, Civil and Civic repeats its submissions
that there was no agreement as at November
or December 1993 whereby Wards was
to perform works other than pursuant to the terms of the Letter of Intent and
Purchase Order of
December 1993.
<P>

71   	Here again, Civil and Civic assert that the scope of works
and general terms and conditions provided to Wards under cover
of Civil and
Civic's letter of 3 August 1993, were merely part of an invitation to Wards to
submit a TGMP and embark upon a process
by which that TGMP would be agreed.
Civil and Civic assert that the general terms and conditions of the alleged
agreement of November
or December 1993 were specifically expressed to be
`draft' and were incomplete in relation to the names of the parties, the price
and all other matters which one would normally expect to be completed in the
appendix and other schedules of a document where one
party alleges that
document constitutes the binding terms and conditions of a lump sum contract of
$16.7million.  Further, Civil
and Civic submit that the correspondence and
circumstances during the period 3 August 1993 until at least December 1993 and
even
thereafter, establishes the fact that Wards itself could not have
reasonably assumed the documents particularised in paragraph 2
of the summons
could meaningfully occupy the basis upon which Wards and Civil and Civic would
agree to be bound for the performance
of the excavation, construction and
associated works in relation to the project.
<P>

72   	Generally, Civil and Civic take issue with the
representational case on a number of bases, including Civil and Civic's
assertion
that the representations could not have reasonably been relied upon
by Wards.
<P>

73   	Civil and Civic denies that it engaged in any misleading
or deceptive conduct in contravention of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></i>.  Civil
and Civic contends that the answer to questions 2, 7 and 9 are all in the
negative.
<P>

74   	As to the estoppel case, Civil and Civic denies that it
acted unconscionably or in breach of any equitable obligation which
it may have
owed to Wards, sufficient to found an estoppel based on the principles
discussed in <i>Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20164%20CLR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 164 CLR 387.</a>
Civil and Civic in negating question 6, submit that Wards cannot establish any
factual or legal basis to claim an estoppel as pleaded
in circumstances where
:
<P>

(i)	the actions of Wards leading to the execution of the Subcontract of 18 May
1994 were, if mistaken, not due to any conduct on
the part of Civil and
Civic;
<P>

(ii)	if there was false and misleading conduct by Civil and Civic, then such
conduct was not relied upon by Wards;
<P>

(iii)	there was no knowledge or unconscionable conduct on the part of Civil and
Civic sufficient to lead to a finding that Civil
and Civic knew of Wards'
mistake;
<P>

(iv)	there was no agreement as at November/December 1993 by which Wards
performed its works other than the letter of intent of 6
December 1993 and
related Purchase Order.  That agreement is said by Civil and Civic to have been
only in relation to a TGMP of $16.7million
and a process by which that TGMP
would be converted into a GMP contract at a future point.
<P>

75   	As to the alleged breach of duty of care case, Civil and
Civic have a number of contentions.  Civil and Civic denies making
the
representations.
<P>

76   	Civil and Civic further says that in the event that it is
found to have made the representations and/or further representations,
then
such representations were made in circumstances where they were both reasonable
and accurate at the time they were made and
that they were made within the
context of Wards' knowledge of the nature of the works to be performed and the
works then being performed
by Wards.  Civil and Civic assert that Wards was
fully aware of the rights, obligations and liabilities which Wards was
accepting
by participating in the process of design development after the
acceptance of the TGMP in November 1993 and upon executing the Subcontract
of
18 May 1994.
<P>

77   	Generally, in relation to each of the matters the subject
of paragraphs 19A, 19B and 19C of the summons and the related matters
raised by
question 8 of the questions for separate determination, Civil and Civic repeats
its earlier submissions in relation to
Wards' claim for false or misleading
conduct.  That is, that Wards at no time relied on any of the alleged
representations, even
if found to have been made.  In any event, Civil and
Civic deny owing Wards any duty of care as alleged in paragraph 19B of the
summons
and further denies any breach of any such duty in any event contrary to
the matters alleged in paragraph 19C of the summons.
<P>

78   	Accordingly, Civil and Civic contend that question 8
should be answered in the negative.
<P>

79   	As to question 10 of the questions for separate
determination, which contemplates whether the plaintiff is `entitled to damages
in negligence or pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 82</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>'</i>,
Civil and Civil denies any such entitlement.
<P>

80   	Accordingly, Civil and Civic contends that the answer to
question 10 is no.
<P>

81   	As to the question 4 alternative claim of quantum meruit,
Civil and Civic seek to negate question 4, submitting that the summons
does not
satisfactorily plead a case setting out the factual or legal bases upon which
the alternative claim for a quantum meruit
is sought.  It submits that the
Court could not be satisfied that the only basis upon which Wards would be
entitled to remuneration
for the work performed by it is on a quantum meruit
basis, particularly in circumstances where Wards continued to perform work and
is said to have represented to Civil and Civic by its conduct that it would not
seek to impugn the terms of the 18 May 1994 Subcontract,
after first allegedly
learning of any mistake or discrepancies in the Subcontract compared to the
alleged agreement of December 1993.
<P>

82   	Civil and Civic submit that the circumstances which could
give rise to a quantum meruit are not satisfied particularly where
:
<P>

(i)	Wards is said to have engaged in a fully informed process leading to the
agreement of a TGMP.
<P>

(ii)	Wards is said to have participated in design development over 5&#189;
months after the TGMP was agreed.
<P>

(iii)	Wards is said to have agreed to contractual regimes during that period of
design development whereby Wards is said to have
been obliged to and in fact to
have purported to perform its works in accordance with the Letter of Intent of
6 December 1996 and
the 7 February 1997 early works Subcontract.
<P>

(iv)	Wards is said to have been fully informed about the accuracy or otherwise
of the alleged representations prior to the signing
of the Subcontract of 18
May 1995.
<P>

(v)	Wards is said to have accepted payments by way of progress claims up to and
after the time it alleges it first became aware
of any alleged differences in
the terms of the Subcontract and alleged agreement.
<P>

83   	Civil and Civic then submit that it would be unjust to
permit Wards to now seek remuneration on the basis of a quantum meruit
in
circumstances where it unreasonably relied upon the alleged representation, if
found to have been made, at the time of signing
the 18 May 1994 Subcontract,
because Civil and Civic assert that Wards must have known as at 18 May 1994
that those representations
were false.
<P>

84   	Civil and Civic further submit that further, Wards
continued to perform work after first becoming allegedly aware of its purported
mistake in relation to the content and effect of the 18 May 1994 Subcontract.
Civil and Civic submit that Wards nevertheless continued
to perform its works
knowing that Civil and Civic only recognised that Subcontract as the basis upon
which Wards could perform those
works.
<P>

85   	Paragraphs 20 through to 26 of Wards' contentions earlier
set out and to be referred to a referee do not relate to any of
the questions
for separate determination now before the Court.
<P>

<b>Dramatis Personae</b>

<b>The Facts</b>
<P>

87   	I turn to examine the facts.  Plainly of special
significance are the formal communications between the parties leading to
the
execution on 18 May 1994 of the Subcontract.
<P>

88   	The vast bulk of the documentary tender went into evidence
as Exhibit PX, comprising a number of folders.  It is generally
convenient
where referring to specific documents to use the PX references.  During the
course of the hearing, a number of central
documents were referred to
repeatedly.  Without being exhaustive, it was convenient to give these
documents a separate reference
and they are the documents which became `J1' and
following.  In the course of preparation for writing the judgment, further J
numbers
have been allocated.  When these documents are referred to in the
course of the Judgment, the `J' reference will often be the most
convenient
mode of reference.
<P>

89   	Extracts from the documentary tender comprising the record
of these communications between the parties are initially set out
below.  In a
case of this type, it is not practicable to avoid a relatively detailed
examination of the evidence given by the witnesses
as to the genealogy of
certain of the documents and as to their contemporaneous beliefs as to what the
documents stated.  Where emphasis
is sought to be given to particular excerpts
of oral evidence the material is underlined.
<P>

<b>23 June 1992 invitation to tender [J1]</b>
<P>

90   	By letter dated 23 June 1992 Civil and Civic wrote to
Wards inviting Wards to tender for the works which would form part of
the
Prospect Water Treatment Works project.  The letter advised that Wards' tender
`should be submitted in accordance with the conditions
of tendering'.  The
letter enclosed a package of relevant documents for Wards' attention.  
<P>

91   	The documents enclosed under cover of this letter included
a document entitled `Conditions of Tendering for Subcontract'.

are appended as Appendix `A' to this Judgment.
 The only reference to this

<i>`6.10 Variations by C&amp;C</i>
<P>

<i>6.10.1.	C&amp;C, by written notice, may instruct a variation at any time
prior to the Date of Practical Completion of the Head Contract

Subcontractor must comply promptly with that instruction within the time
specified by C&amp;C.  The Subcontractor will not
be entitled to payment for a
variation unless the Subcontractor first provides C&amp;C with a copy of a
written instruction from
C&amp;C to execute the variation.</i>
<P>

<i>6.10.2.	If the Subcontractor considers that a drawing, instruction or
direction issued by C&amp;C, although not stated to involve
a variation, in
fact involves a variation then the Subcontractor must give written notice to
C&amp;C before commencing work in relation
to the drawing, instruction or
direction.  Compliance with this Clause will be a condition precedent to any
claim the Subcontractor
may have for an extension of time or for a
variation.'</i>

98   	A number of further blanks appear in annexures to the
Subcontract including the Schedule of Additional Subcontract terms which

variation?  How will it be differentiated from a `design development
encompassed in the original scope?'</i>
<P>

105   	This facsimile makes plain an early focus by Wards on the
need to differentiate between `variations' and `design development'.
<P>

<b>7 July 1992 - Wards submit their tender for the project  [J3]</b>
<P>

106   	By letter dated 7 July 1992 from Wards to Civil and
Civic, Wards submitted its tender for the project.  The letter advised
inter
alia that the tender:
<P>

<i> `forms the establishment of a "network agreement" between ourselves the
basis of which can be summarised by the following:</i>
<P>

<i>Invitation to tender dated 23 June 1992.</i>
<P>

<i>Agreement of confidentiality</i>
<P>

<i>Drawings, refer attachment number 1 . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Specification No. 27, concrete</i>
<P>

<i>Contractor's programme dated 1 July 1992.'</i>
<P>

107   	The letter also advised that `in addition, discussions
have led to the following agreements and clarifications'.  This sentence
was
followed by references to a number of matters including matters concerning
scope of work.  
<P>

108   	Following the specific references to particular matters
dealing with scope of work, the letter includes the following paragraph
:
<P>

<i>`We have allowed specific contingencies against sections of the work which
are not detailed sufficiently, or where there is adequate
[sic] geological
information to properly assess costs.  Elsewhere we have allowed a small global
risk contingency to cover the costs
of details not available on the
"preliminary" drawings.  We understand that changes in quantities or scope
resulting from design
changes will be paid as variations to the contract at the
rates set out in the accompanying schedule.'</i>
<P>

<b>16 July 1992 letter from Civil and Civic to Wards  [J4]</b>
<P>

109   	By letter dated 16 July 1992, Civil and Civic wrote to
Wards advising that in confirmation of their recent discussions, they
were
writing to clarify current arrangements regarding the project.
<P>

110   	The letter continued inter alia:
<P>

<i>`As you are aware, we are at present preparing our submission bid based on
pricing that has been provided by you.  You have been competitive
in most areas
of your scope of works with some minor areas yet to be finalised.  Given the
current time restraints, we would intend
to address these matters when we are
awarded preferred tenderer status.</i>
<P>

<i>In the post-bid phase, we would look forward to working toward establishing
a contract with you based on our exclusive arrangement
and the pricing that has
been provided to date.  The basis of the contract would be the following
documents which you have received
throughout the bid period.:  . . .</i>

<b>Letter of 29 July 1993/3 August 1993 from Civil and Civic to Wards  [J5 and
J6]</b>
<P>

111   	On 29 July 1993, Civil and Civic wrote to Wards inviting
it to prepare a TGMP proposal.  A letter in identical terms was
resubmitted to
Wards on 3 August 1993.  Mr Levido to whose attention the letters were
addressed, accepted that he had received the
earlier draft.
<P>

112   	The letter has already been set out in full.
<P>

113   	The enclosures to the letter sent on 3 August 1993
included inter alia, the following:
<P>

<i>`(a)	A document entitled `Procurement Programme "WAT Broc"</i> [Exhibit PX
volume 3 page 140]
<P>

<i>(b)	The document entitled `Scope of Works "WAT BSOW" </i>[Exhibit PX volume

the scope of works].
<P>

<i>(c)	A further document entitled `Scope of Works' </i>[Exhibit PX volume 3 at
page 142.  This document appears to be a longer version of the Scope of Works.
The document begins:  "The
following civil and structural components <u>will

document includes at PX volume 3 at page 148 the following paragraph:
<P>

<i>"</i><cite>General</cite>
<P>

<i>P Ward Civil Engineering are responsible for the bulk earthworks and
associated works as detailed above.</i>
<P>

<i>After the TGMP Phase Wards will be responsible for participation in design
development to ensure that document intent as priced and
detailed remains

<P>

114   	The enclosures also include a document entitled `Drawing

<P>

115   	The further enclosures to the 3 August 1993 letter
included the form of subcontract which is again generally in blank save
for
identifying the project and the location.  It is to be found at PX volume 3
pages 155 through to 226.  The Appendix at PX volume
3 pages 222 through to
226, is likewise in blank.
<P>

116   	The same letter also enclosed a specification to be found
at PX volume 3 page 227 and following.  The specification begins
with a
preamble reading inter alia:
<P>

<i>`This specification comprises preliminary specification notes identifying
the general intent of the design.</i>

<P>

<b>Letter from Wards to Civil and Civic of 23 August 1993  [J7]</b>
<P>

117   	By letter of 23 August 1993, Wards wrote to Civil and
Civic in the following terms:
<P>

<i>`Re Prospect Water Filtration Plant</i>
<P>

<i>Civic&amp;Clear Water Tank Package</i>
<P>

<i>Target Guaranteed Maximum Price Proposal</i>
<P>

<i>We refer to your letter dated 3 August 1993 wherein you sought from us our
detailed proposal for the construction of earthworks, clear
water tank and
various other structures which form a part of the Prospect Water Filtration
Project.</i>
<P>

<i>This proposal is to be in line with the relationship established and
maintained between our respective companies for the purpose of
both preparing a
successful tender bid for the project and operating a successful
project.</i>
<P>

<i>Since the time of the original tender there have been a series of departures
from the tendered scope.  These have been priced and
submitted to yourselves as
variations.</i>
<P>

<i>In order that our offer may be consolidated we have prepared our quotation
for the current scopes.  In addition to this we have prepared
a list of
potential areas where we consider savings may be made during the design
development phase.  These have been left as options
to be developed over this
period prior to the development of a Guaranteed Maximum Price.</i>
<P>

<i>We also attach a summary of contract conditions upon which this offer is
based.</i>
<P>

<i>We trust that this information satisfies your requirements and look forward
to continuing our partnership arrangement on this project.
 Should you require
any additional information please contact either Mike Manion or myself.'</i>
<P>

118   	That letter was signed by Mr Levido as Wards' estimating
manager.
<P>

119   	The letter enclosed a number of documents.  These
included a document entitled `Prospect Water Filtration Plant TGMP August
1993'
which traced changes.  The document had six columns entitled as follows:
<P>

<i>Description;  July 1992 Submission;  Additional Works;  June 1993 Update;
August TGMP;  Changes 6/93 to 8/93</i>
<P>

120   	The document enclosed a page entitled `Contract
conditions'.  This read inter alia:
<P>

<i>`In addition to the general conditions of contract we require the following
conditions to be incorporated in the final contract agreement.
 Where these are
in conflict with the general conditions these shall take precedence . .
.</i>
<P>

<cite>Variations</cite>
<P>

<i>Our price is based on our receiving design information in sufficient time as
to minimise the effect of cost increases brought about
by design development.
We also require the full benefit of cost reductions caused by design
improvement regardless of who initiated
the improvement.  This would also to
all savings in excess of those nominated in this submission which have been
offered on a shared
savings basis of fifty percent.</i>
<P>

<i>Where variations arise from either Client or Water Board directed works we
expect full reimbursement.'</i>
<P>

121   	The document also enclosed three pages entitled `Risk
profile'.  These included the following:
<P>

<i>`During the bid phase we were requested to include for various areas of risk
ie those which it was most economical for us to control
in order that the
overall risk profile of the project could be reduced.  This was done by way of
various contingent items wherein
we made allowance for risks of which we were
aware.</i>
<P>

<i>Our assessment of the risks to which we would be exposed were as
follows:'</i>
<P>

<i>. . . </i>
<P>

<cite>Design Risk</cite><i>	  raw water pumping station Training Walls</i>
<P>

<i>	 clear water tank structure grilles</i>
<P>

<i>	 filter block sub-grade</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><cite> generally throughout project as original scope lacked detail
which may increase construction costs</cite><i>.'</i>
<P>

[Emphasis added]
<P>

122   	The document continued inter alia, as follows:
<P>

<i>`These risks were assessed in four ways subject to the nature of the risk
and its potential affect to our involvement on the project.
 These were as
follows:</i>
<P>

<i>Acknowledge risk but aim to be able to manage it such that no cost increase
would be necessary.</i>
<P>

<i>Identify and value the most economical solution.</i>
<P>

<i>Include for risk in general pricing such that offer covered a reasonable
average of the conditions which may be encountered.</i>
<P>

<i>Where risks were known to occur but it was not possible to quantify them we
included a non-specific contingency to our pricing for
that area of
work.</i>
<P>

<i>It is also confirmed that the risks accepted by us are to the same level as
accepted between Civil and Civic and its client.  Therefore
should any event
exceed that limit we require the same protection and reimbursement and [sic]
Civil &amp; Civic receive.</i>
<P>

<i>During the original tender phase we were advised that we would have access
to the design team throughout the project and that savings
generated through
design change would remain to our account.  Similarly the reverse would stand
that we were expected to bear the
consequences of additional costs arising
during the design development phase as long as the design remained within the
original concept.
 We made allowance for this as part of our tender.</i>
<P>

<i>By this access we envisaged that we would be able to manage our various
risks at times having our costs increased by design detailing
and at other
times having them reduced.'</i>
<P>

123   	The final three paragraphs in the `risk profile'
enclosure read as follows:
<P>

<i>`</i><cite>Design system</cite>
<P>

<i>It has been our experience that construction costs on projects where the
design has not been finalised before construction starts
can be significantly
higher than on those where the design has been completed.</i>
<P>

<i>Additional costs arise through delays, reworking and performing small areas
of work inefficiently.</i>
<P>

<i>We have tendered the works on the basis that as it is Civil &amp; Civic
managing the design process such problems will not occur.
 However prior to
final confirmation of our price we need to agree the design management system
which will assure this.'</i>
<P>

124   	A further enclosure was entitled `Potential savings'.
This enclosure commenced:
<P>

<i>`We have identified the following as potential savings to our scope of works
which would be brought about by design development. 
It is anticipated that our
Guaranteed Maximum Price will be reduced by 50% of the actual savings achieved
when each opportunity is
realised. . .'</i>
<P>

<b>26 September 1993 Letter from Wards to Civil and Civic  [J8]</b>
<P>

125   	By letter dated 26 September 1993, Wards wrote to Civil
and Civic as follows:
<P>

<i>`We refer to our letter dated 23 August 1993 and subsequent discussions with
your staff regarding the construction of the civil works
and clear water tanks
on this project.</i>
<P>

<i>Arising form [sic] these discussions we seek now to resubmit our priced bill
of quantities for these works.  This takes into account
an adjustment brought
about by an error in our concrete suppliers quotation as well as adjustments to
ensure that the price matches
our current understanding of scope.</i>
<P>

<i>We also attach a table showing our current understanding of the risks
associated with the project together with potential opportunities
we see for
design development.  It is our intention to work with your team over the Price
Validation Period prior to the confirmation
of the Guaranteed Maximum Price to
both prove that the design savings are achievable and to minimise the
outstanding risks.  It is
confirmed that these issues must be considered
concurrently in order to offset the potentially large windfall wins and
losses.</i>
<P>

<i>We attach our proposals for the management of the risks for the concrete
structures and earthworks . . .'</i>
<P>

126   	This letter was again signed by Mr Manion describing
himself in the letter as `Project Manager'.
<P>

127   	The letter enclosed a number of documents.  These
included a document entitled `Risk Profile' which read inter alia:
<P>

<i>`As requested we detail herewith our proposal relating to Risk
Profile.</i>
<P>

<cite>A.	Concrete Structures</cite>
<P>

<i>As you are aware the concrete structures have been measured and valued by
our QS and estimators.  A comprehensive breakdown of our
price has been
submitted to you in the form of a bill of quantities resulting in our Target
Guaranteed Maximum Price.</i>
<P>

<i>This format will remain until finally a Guaranteed Maximum Price is
agreed.</i>
<P>

<i>The contingencies we have allowed for in our price relating to the concrete
structures have been separated from our TGMP at this stage
and are detailed
separately.</i>
<P>

<i>These contingencies are to accommodate changes in design which resulted in
an increase in cost.</i>
<P>

<i>Our rates indicated in our bill of quantities do not allow for any
contingencies required as a result of design changes.</i>
<P>

<i>In order to resolve the issue of this risk and its associated value we
propose the following:</i>
<P>

<i>. . . 5.	Any saving resulting from the contingencies not being expended will
be distributed as follows:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	Design consultants responsible for that are of work	10%</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	Civil &amp; Civic	45%</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	WCE	45%</i>
<P>

128   	On the second page of the risk profile, the following
matters are inter alia set out:
<P>

<i>`There are other matters relating to the risk profile which have not been
mentioned above:</i>
<P>

<i>. . . 3.	</i><cite>Delayed or inadequate design</cite><i> - We have been
constantly assured that the design procedure will be such that construction
will not be carried out on a basis of
design today, construct tomorrow,
literally.</i>
<P>

<i>In the past, we have had several problems with projects which have had a
lack of adequate design/drawing at and near the time of actual
construction.</i>
<P>

<i>The design process which has been discussed is expected to eliminate such
problems and hence our price does not include for any delays
resulting from
insufficient or inadequate design.</i>
<P>

<i>Should delays of this nature eventuate it is understood that this risk is a
responsibility of Civil &amp; Civic.</i>
<P>

<i>We note that WCE will cooperate in the design phase to try and avoid an
undesirable situation eventuating.'</i>
<P>

129   	Part of the risk profile document dealing with
`earthworks' included the following paragraph:
<P>

<i>`For other areas, specialist geo-technical advice was sought to provide
detail for specific details.  Specifically the coffer dam
construction method,
filter block subgrade, rock batter stability criteria.  Against these areas we
adopted the recommendations of
the Geotechnical Consultant with no allowance
for additional costs.  Thus if the information provided previously was
insufficient
to carry out the work effectively then we will have to increase
our price for these items.  These issues have been identified as
risks to be
resolved during the Price Validation Period prior to the agreement of the
Guaranteed Maximum Price.'</i>
<P>

130   	The table attached to the 26 September 1993 letter and

<b>22 October 1993 - High level meeting  [J8A]</b>
<P>

132   	On 22 October 1993, a meeting took place attended by Mr
Robinson and Mr Hayes of Civil and Civic and by Mr Levido, Mr Niederberger
and
Mr Manion from Wards.  An issue arises as to whether Mr Cherrie, also noted as
in attendance in Mr Levido's contemporaneously
kept day book (later recreated
as PX volume 9 tab 36(b)), was in attendance.
<P>

133   	The minutes of this meeting include the following:
<P>

<i>`2 contracts 	- summary of commitments to date for GMP</i>
<P>

<i>				- final document</i>
<P>

<cite>Design development to remain with us:</cite>
<P>

<i>	- if margins are being cribbed and design calls for unexpected works, there
will be some latitude for additional dollars - final

</i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

134   	A handwritten note at the end of the document signed by
Mr Levido reads:
<P>

<i>`These are the record of lost handwritten notes.</i>
<P>

<i>A.F. Levido 26 March 1993'</i>
<P>

135   	Mr Niederberger's notes of the same meeting do not record
Mr Cherrie as being present.  Those handwritten and contemporaneous
notes
record the meeting as having been a design meeting and held on 22 October 1993.
The notes include the following:
<P>

<i>`WCE to take on Design Development</i>
<P>

<i>[Therefore] no variations unless C&amp;C get a variation (i.e. need to use
the pot of money made at the start).'</i>
<P>

136   	Also admitted into evidence was a file note which Mr
Levido believed was in Mr Glasgow's handwriting.  [J8C]  The file note
bears a
date `21 October'.  The defendants assert the probabilities that it is a record
of the same meeting of 22 October 1994, particularly
because at the foot of the
first page it reads:
<P>

<i>`[Wards] will be responsible for Design Development Risk unless Prospect
Water can get variation from client.'</i>
<P>

<b>Letter from Wards to Civil and Civic of 17 November 1993  [J9]</b>
<P>

137   	By letter dated 17 November 1993, Wards wrote again to
Civil and Civic.  Whereas previous letters had been headed:
<P>

<i>`Re:  PROSPECT WATER FILTRATION PLANT</i>
<P>

<i>CIVIL AND CLEAR WATER TANK PACKAGE TARGET GUARANTEED MAXIMUM PRICE
PROPOSAL'</i>
<P>

This letter dropped the word `Proposal' from the heading.  The letter was in
the following terms:
<P>

<i>`We refer to our previous correspondence and discussions regarding our
target guaranteed maximum price for the construction of the
civil works and
clear water tank package at this project.</i>
<P>

<i>We wish to confirm our acceptance of your offer of Sixteen Million Seven
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($16,700,000) as being the Target
Guaranteed Maximum
Price for this work.  We attach a copy of our most recent bill of quantities to
reflect this.</i>
<P>

<i>We confirm that this price is deemed to include for the costs of design
development and site allowance </i><cite>within the defined
scope</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>It is agreed that both parties shall now make all endeavours necessary until
21 January 1994 to develop the design to a stage whereby
the [sic] this target
price can be converted into a lump sum contract of equal value.</i>
<P>

<i>In the intervening period urgent works may proceed under separate minor
works orders as attached.  The value of these have been calculated
from the
current price bill of quantities.</i>
<P>

<i>Please confirm your agreement of this to us.'  </i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

138   	This letter was signed by Mr Manion describing himself as
`administration manager'.
<P>

139   	The letter included a document entitled `urgent works'
which identified six items of work totalling $595,162.70.
<P>

140   	The letter also included a document entitled `Target
Guaranteed Maximum Price Summary Revision `B'' which summarised a 28
page
document entitled `TGMP/D'.  For the purposes of this Judgment it should
suffice to append as Appendix `D' only pages 1, 27
and 28 of the document.  The
general nature of the document is clear enough by reference to those pages but
the full document of
course requires to be read.
<P>

141   	The TGMP/D document concluded with a price total of
$16,700,000.
<P>

<b>6 December 1993 - Early works package letter of intent  [J10]</b>
<P>

142   	By letter dated 6 December 1993, Civil and Civic wrote to
Wards in the following terms:
<P>

<i>`Re Prospect Water Filtration Plant</i>
<P>

<i>Civil Works Early Works Package</i>
<P>

<i>Letter of Intent</i>
<P>

<i>We have pleasure in confirming our intention to enter into a contract with
yourselves for the early works in the Lump Sum Tender Price
of $250,000 . . ..
Reference our Invitation to provide a TGMP of 29 July 1993 . . </i>.[Clearly a
reference to Document J5 earlier referred to.]
<P>

<i>We attach a copy of our Subcontract Checklist which summarises our
discussions and agreements as per our meetings to date, and ask
you to note and
action the outstanding points in accordance with the timeframe as required by
the tender documents.</i>
<P>

<i>Please ensure that you provide all necessary information, material, plant
and equipment, manpower and any other resources deemed necessary
to comply with
the Construction Programme to achieve the scheduled completion dates.</i>
<P>

<i>A formal Subcontract Agreement is being prepared and we will contact you
when this has been finalised to arrange a convenient time
for signing of the

<P>

<i>This Letter of Intent is subject to the execution by both parties of the
said Agreement.</i>
<P>

<i>The breakdown of the expenditure covered by this Letter of Intent is as
follows:</i>
<P>

<i>[A breakdown of items was then set out totalling $250,000]</i>
<P>

<i>We look forward to a successful project and trust that we will have a
pleasant and mutually rewarding association.'</i>
<P>

<b>December 1993 Purchase order  [J11]</b>
<P>

143   	Civil and Civic forwarded a purchase order to Wards in
December 1993 dealing with silt curtains in the sum of $48,500.  The
reverse
side of the purchase order included a number of terms and conditions.
<P>

<b>The First of the `Design Improvement Opportunities' or `Plus/Minus' Register
documents - January 1994 [J11A]</b>
<P>

144   	On a number of occasions, Wards prepared what was
generally referred to in the evidence and in a number of contemporaneous
documents as `Plus/Minus' or `&#177;' registers.  The documents were entitled
`Prospect Water Filtration Project Design Improvement
Opportunities'.  They
generally assigned a positive value to something which would save Wards money
and a negative value to something
which may cost Wards money.  In this first
Plus/Minus Register, there were four columns reading from left to right:
`Description';
 `Value';  `Current Value';  and `Action'.  The document is
appended as Appendix E to this Judgment.  It will be seen that, under
the
`description' column, towards the end of the document relating to `Hornicks',
the heading reads:  `General reduction in price
to fit TGMP'.
<P>

145   	The `Value' column stated the potential exposure which
Wards perceived at the point in time when the register was printed
out.  The
`Current Value' column set out the currently valued extent of the exposure.
<P>

146   	Later the Plus/Minus registers altered in the position in
which the columns were placed but otherwise, the content of the
registers
remained essentially the same.
<P>

147   	It will be noticed that the fourth item in this first
Plus/Minus register dealing with `Subgrade improvement beneath lime
saturater's
states in the `Description' column:  `Currently this does not appear to be
required but this has not yet been finalised'.
 It includes a negative item in
parenthesis in both `Value' and `Current Value' columns and in the `Action'
column, includes the
statement:  `Potential for additional works not in current
scope'.
<P>

148   	The total `Value' column in this first Plus/Minus
Register was expressed in positive terms in the amount $1,930,000.  This
was
effectively Wards asserting in the document that if its TGMP was $16.7million,
then to use the defendant's expression, it was
`currently in front of the game
$1.93million'.
<P>

<b>7 February 1994 Early Works Subcontract  [J12]</b>
<P>

149   	On 7 February 1994, Civil and Civic and Wards entered
into a formal contract, the first two paragraphs of which read as follows:
<P>

<i>`THE PARTIES AGREE :</i>

<i>(a)	an increase or decrease in or omissions from the Works.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	a change in the character or quality of material or work.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	a change in the levels, lines, positions or dimensions of a part of the
Works.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	execution of additional work.</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	a change to the nature or scope of the Works which results from a
direction or instruction issued to C&amp;C under the Head Contract.'</i>
<P>

151   	The contract also includes clause 6.10, reading as
follows:
<P>

<i>`</i><cite>6.10  Variations by C&amp;C</cite>
<P>

<i>6.10.1	C&amp;C, by written notice, may instruct a variation at any time
prior to the Date of Substantial Completion of the Contract
and the Contractor
must comply promptly with that instruction within the time specified by
C&amp;C.  The Contractor will not be entitled
to payment for a variation unless
the Contractor first provides C&amp;C with a copy of a written instruction from
C&amp;C to execute
the variation.</i>
<P>

<i>6.10.2	If the Contractor considers that a drawing, instruction or direction
issued by C&amp;C, although not stated to involve a variation,
in fact involves
a variation then the Contractor must give written notice to C&amp;C before
commencing work in relation to the drawing,
instruction or direction.
Compliance with this Clause will be a condition precedent to any claim the
Contractor may have for a variation.</i>
<P>

<i>6.10.3	The Contractor will not be entitled to a payment for a variation
under this clause 6.10 in repsect [sic] of a Design Development
Variation.'</i>
<P>

152   	Clause 6.30 of the contract was in the following
terms:
<P>

<i>`6.30	</i><cite>Design Development</cite>
<P>

<i>6.30.1	The Contractor acknowledges that :</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the design of the works is not finalised and further development of the
design will be undertaken by C&amp;C;  and</i>
<P>

<i>9b)	the development of the design may result in changes to the Works
(`Design Development Variations') including matters which would
otherwise
constitute variations.</i>
<P>

<i>6.30.2	Notwithstanding any other term of this Contract C&amp;C will not be
liable for any losses suffered by the Contractor in connection
with and no
adjustment will be made to the Contract Sum in respect of any Design
Development Variation except to the extent that
C&amp;C receives payment for
the Design Development Variation under the Head Contract.</i>
<P>

<i>6.30.3	If an amount is payable to the Contractor under Clause 6.30.2, the
amount shall be determined under Clause 10.4 but shall in
no circumstances
exceed the amount payable to C&amp;C under the Head Contract in respect of the
Design Development Variation.'</i>
<P>

153   	Mr Keetley of Wards signed the contract on Wards' behalf
and initialled at the foot of each page.  His evidence was that
in about
February 1994, he became aware of the fact that Wards was awaiting a payment of
about $200,000 from Civil and Civic in relation
to work carried out at
Prospect.  Wards was anxious to receive this payment because it had incurred
substantial expenses on the Prospect
project by the time and it had the usual
cash flow problems which it had in February following upon the construction
industry Christmas
shut down.  Mr Keetley was aware that payment would not be
made to Wards by Civil and Civic until such time as it had signed the
contract
with Civil and Civic.
<P>

154   	Mr Cherrie was the person who was responsible for signing
the contract with Civil and Civic.  However, on 7 February 1994,
Mr Cherrie was
away from the office.  Although Mr Keetley did not know anything about the
matter, Mr Cherrie requested that he attend
the offices of Civil and Civic in
Sydney in order to sign a contract which would enable Wards to receive payment
of moneys due to
it from Civil and Civic.  Mr Cherrie told Mr Keetley that Mr
Keetley had to meet with Mr O'Connell and that the contract which he
was to
sign was for a value of around $1.5million.
<P>

155   	Mr Keetley attended the office of Civil and Civic during
the morning of 7 February and met with Mr David Knight who told
Mr Keetley that
the contract was not ready for him when he arrived and Mr Keetley, in
consequence, had to wait for several minutes
before the contract was ready.
<P>

156   	In due course, Mr Knight handed to Mr Keetley the
contract and asked him to sign it.  As Mr Keetley had been simply asked
to sign
the document by Mr Cherrie, Mr Keetley understood that the document had been
agreed upon between Wards and Civil and Civic
and so he did not ask Mr Knight
for any explanation about the terms of the contract.  Mr Knight did not draw
his attention to any
clauses in the contract or say anything to him about its
terms.  Mr Keetley then signed the contract.  When Mr Keetley attended Civil
and Civic's offices, he understood that he would be handed a cheque.  He was
unable to recall whether he had received a cheque on
that day but understood
that Wards' accounts department did bank a cheque from Civil and Civic on 7
February 1994 and in consequence
believes that he must have received a cheque
from Civil and Civic and taken it back to Wards' office.
<P>

<b>Sometime after the 7th February Early Works Contract Mr Manion prepares and
gives to Mr Pittolo a document entitled `Contract Conditions'</b>
<P>

157   	Under cross-examination, Mr Pittolo gave evidence that
sometime after the 7 February 1994 early works contract, Mr Manion,
prior to
his leaving the site, prepared a document for Mr Pittolo which brought to Mr
Pittolo's attention some of the contract conditions.
 That document was
tendered as Exhibit D6.  To use Mr Pittolo's words:
<P>

<i>`Mike Manion prepared a report, for want of a better word, I can't remember
the exact title of it, which tracked the changes in contract
conditions from
about - I think it is from the first letter here in July of 1992 up to November
1993 and it set out certain things
which had not - which had been discussed but
had not been resolved.'   </i>[T276]
<P>

158   	Mr Pittolo's cross-examination then included the
following:
<P>

<i>`Q.	So that the document told you as at January or February that there was
still matters which had not been resolved?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Do you remember which matters they were?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I believe they were included but I am not one hundred percent certain.
Rise and fall, there was a reduction that we were offered
in overheads because
we had work taken out of our contract and there were another couple of matters
. . .'</i>   [T277]
<P>

159   	Exhibit D6 is headed `Contract conditions' as the cover
page and includes a miscellaneous set of documents including a document
entitled `Payment Schedules'.  That document includes the following:
<P>

<i>`4.	In the draft contract offered to us Civil and Civic are unclear as to
the means of payment.  Clause 10.5 still exists, however,
previously it
referred to clause 10.3 for the valuation of the months work.</i>
<P>

<i>However clause 10.3 has been noted as `NOT USED' in this contract.  Further,
this notes the date for progress claims as being 45 days.'</i>
<P>

160   	The document includes certain summaries of the dealings
between the parties.  It is divided by a series of dividers, being
the green
pages within it.  Those dividers include the headings `Civil and Civic
Invitation to Quote including Conditions of Contract';
 `Wards Civil
Engineering Tender Offer';  `Civil and Civic "Response" to our Tender';
`Target Guaranteed Price Submission 23 August
1993';  `Extracts from Civil and
Civic Contract Document' and `Final Target Guaranteed Maximum Price Submission
17 November 1993'.
<P>

161   	Where the page headed `Payment Schedules' had referred to
`the draft contract offered to us', Mr Manion was clearly referring
to the 7
February early works contract.  Hence the statement that `clause 10.5 still
exists, however, previously it referred to 10.3
for the valuation of the
month's work'.  There is, of course, a clause 10.5 in the early works
contract.
<P>

162   	On the same page, Mr Manion was stating that clause 10.3
had been noted as `not used' in that early works contract.
<P>

163   	I accept the defendant's submission that Mr Manion in
this document which was handed to Mr Pittolo, had been looking at what
the
early works contract had said, as a draft of what the future would hold for the
final contract.  This was, as Mr Finch of senior
counsel for the defendant
submitted, for the purposes of giving Mr Pittolo `a cheat sheet about what to
do in the process of leading
up to the final contract'.  Mr Manion had gone
back to the 3 August 1993 letter and in particular to the enclosed blank
subcontract
which had for example, included a clause entitled '10.3 Valuation
of the Works'.  Mr Manion had stated in the cheat sheet document,
Exhibit D7,
the words `however clause 10.3 has been noted as `not used' in this contract'.
What he was saying here was that he had
been comparing the draft form of
subcontract enclosed under cover of the 3rd August 1993 letter from Civil and
Civic with the 7 February
early works contract.  I infer that the reason why Mr
Manion had put together Exhibit D7, as Mr Pittolo had stated, was to inform
Mr
Pittolo as to what was occurring about negotiations for a final contract.
Nothing in Exhibit D6 for example deals with the topic
of `rubbish'.

<b>10 February 1994 Partnering Meeting</b>
<P>

164   	Exhibit PX volume 10A Tab 48b comprises an agenda for and
detail in relation to a `Partnering Meeting' held on 10 February
1994 and
attended by a number of representatives from Wards and from Civil and Civic.
The representatives attending from Wards included
Mr Ward, Mr Keetley, Mr
Cherrie, Mr Pittolo, Mr Manion and Mr Niederberger.  The representatives
attending representing Civil and
Civic included Mr Robinson, Mr O'Connell and
Mr Hayes.  
<P>

165   	The materials prepared by Mr Manion as to the
`Introduction to Work Session', treat with the topic of the partnering
arrangement
which is likened to a marriage.  This page includes, inter alia:
<P>

<i>`At the moment we are pretty much engaged to each other.  However before we
go to the altar we need to test this relationship to find
how we each will act:
 . . .</i>
<P>

<i>We now propose to apply our intentions as partners to construction
situations which may arise on the project . . . We also wish to
note that to
date such issues have been recorded on a balance sheet.  This measures our wins
and losses, the swings and roundabouts
(see example).</i>
<P>

<i>As on [sic] of these issues which affect the project cost is identified we
value it and record it and hopefully track the value of
the contract.  At the
end of the current phase we will know what its value is in relation to the
figure offered to us as a [TGMP].
 At present the ledger is reasonably evenly
balanced.</i>
<P>

<i>We would recommend in all these issues that when considering a point that
you look at the issues try and also view it from the other
partners' position
and hopefully find a resolution which is mutually beneficial - A-WIN-WIN
solution if you listen to the jargon'.</i>
<P>

166   	The same material under the head `design development'
deal with the topic of a suggested additional costs issue, inter alia,
in the
following terms:
<P>

<i>`At tender stage the bridge abutments were shown as being simple sill
abutments with head walls.</i>
<P>

<i>During design development it was shown by Prospect Water Group that the
abutments required wingwalls to retain the road embankments.</i>
<P>

<i>This has caused WCE to incur additional costs in the order of
$17,000.</i>
<P>

<i>This is not a change requested by Australian Water Services or the Water
Board.</i>
<P>

<i>In essence we priced to build four abutments and we are still constructing
four abutments.</i>
<P>

<i>How is this issue resolved?</i>
<P>

<i>Do we spend a great deal of time with the designers trying to delete the
additional work?</i>
<P>

<cite>Is this a variation which is reimbursable to WCE?</cite>
<P>

<i>One speaker from each company two minutes each.'   </i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

167   	Mr Pittolo was shown a note from his notebook which was
added to Exhibit PX at volume 11A Tab 77 [ADD 12].  This note includes
the
words `new scope of works'.
<P>

168   	Mr Pittolo, under cross-examination, accepted that these
notes were notes of the 10th February meeting.  He was asked in
relation to
this note:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And halfway down the left hand page we see a reference to new scope of
works?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	What is that a reference to?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I have no idea.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>One thing it is plainly a reference to a new scope of
works?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Can I suggest that to you?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Do you now recall, casting your mind back, looking at your diary note,
that there was provided to you at or about this time, or
that it was suggested
to you at or about this time, that there would be a new scope of works?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Can I suggest to you that the only possible explanation for your diary
note unless there was an alternative that you wanted a new
scope of
works?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Can you suggest any explanation?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I can't suggest any explanation at all.  I was well aware that the note
was there.  I was trying to recall why I wrote that note
in my diary and I
cannot recall.'  </i>[T298-299]

<b>21 March 1994</b>
<P>

172   	An extract from the note book of Mr O'Connell dated 21
March 1994 dealt with matters discussed between himself and Mr Cherrie.
 The
note is taken from Mr O'Connell's diary or note book.  It includes, inter alia,
the following:
<P>

<i>`Matters noted include:</i>
<P>

<i>"$16.7 + $36K and  + Sod + Subst costs Coffer Dam".</i>
<P>

<i>"Contract Programme  delays - critical 10% - not critical 20%".</i>
<P>

<i>"+$390K best case possibility plus $460K (using PWCE figure) bill potential
$1M"</i>
<P>

<i>RWPS tells us "net cost" $923,675 ... thickeners is a vary ... no rise and
fall</i>
<P>

<i>no allow for loss of overhead and profit on structures</i>
<P>

<i>JHCE/PWCE co-ordination at no cost to C&amp;C</i>
<P>

<i>Project manage - design wins</i>
<P>

<i>"Liquidated damages"</i>
<P>

<i>Site allow.  Potential win (c $&#188;M).' </i>
<P>

173   	Under cross-examination on the note, Mr Cherrie gave the
following evidence:
<P>

<i>`Q.	In any event, it is clear to you that somebody from Wards with
responsibility in this area met with someone at Civil and Civic,
with someone
with responsibility in that area about these matters?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, I agree with that</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Was it usual practice for Mr Pittolo to inform you what was important
from this meeting?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And we can take it, can't we, that such matters as are discussed here
which have importance in the contractual negotiations which
were always going
on in the background and by that I mean only the to-ing and fro-ing between the
parties about what was to happen,
would have been drawn to your
attention?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I would expect so.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	I don't need to take your time in going through each item in the
circumstances.  Without going through all of them, you will see
things like `no
rise and fall' referred to in Mr O'Connell's note?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That is plainly a reference to something which was being talked about in
connection with what the contract was going to say?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.  . . . `</i>   [T204 and 205]
<P>

<b>11 April 1994 Site meeting  [J13A]</b>
<P>

174   	On 11 April 1994, an internal Wards site meeting took
place attended, inter alia, by Mr Cherrie and Mr Pittolo.  The minutes
include
the following:
<P>

<i>`</i><cite>Staff</cite>
<P>

<i>1.2    We will now be employing a "Design Development Manager" to look at
the design opportunities . . .</i>
<P>

<i>12.5	TN to complete an overall construction programme.'  [Action by
`TN']</i>
<P>

<b>Between 12 April 1994 and 28 April 1994 final Draft Scope of Works is
reviewed</b>
<P>

175   	Mr O'Connell, in his first statement, gave evidence that
between 12 April 1994 and 28 April 1994 he reviewed and finalised
`the final
draft of the scope of works document prepared by Mr Kip Hayes'.  Mr O'Connell's
further evidence was that on 28 April
1994 he attended a Quality Meeting with
Mr Fitzgerald at the Wards' site office and that immediately prior to attending
that meeting,
he went into Mr Pittolo's office and said to Mr Pittolo, inter
alia:
<P>

<i>`This is the scope of works for inclusion in the contract.  Glenn [Cherrie]
told me to speak to you about it.'</i>
<P>

176   	Mr O'Connell further said in paragraph 17 of his
statement that Mr Pittolo took the scope of work document from him without
saying anything further.  Approximately an hour later, so Mr O'Connell
recalled, after he had finished the Quality Meeting and before
he left the Ward
site office, he again saw Mr Pittolo who returned the scope of works document
to him and said words to the effect:
 `Tony Niederberger and I made some notes
on it.'
<P>

177   	Mr O'Connell's evidence was that he later included the
scope of works document in the contract but did not incorporate the
written
notes which Mr Pittolo referred to into the scope of work before he included
the document in the contract.
<P>

178   	Mr O'Connell's evidence was that his present recollection
was that those notes did not relate to any matters of substance
but were in the
form of general comments.  Importantly, he recalled that there were no
deletions or amendments to the scope as set
out in the scope of works document.
After that discussion with Mr Pittolo, Mr O'Connell had not spoken again to Mr
Pittolo or to
any other representative of Wards about the form or content of
the Scope of Works until 1995 or later when this dispute arose.
<P>

179   	Mr Pittolo accepted that prior to 18 May, he was handed a
document entitled `Scope of Works' by Mr O'Connell.  He could not
recall
precisely when he had received the document although as already pointed out, at
least one of his diary entries prior to that
time had read `New Scope of
Works'.  [T313]
<P>

180   	Mr Pittolo gave the following further evidence under
cross-examination:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And as you say in your statement you don't know whether that was the
same document which was incorporated into the 18 May contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Even a moments glance at the 18 May contract scope of works shows you
that it's different to, for instance, the preliminary version
of the scope of
works one saw back in 1992 and in 1993?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And it was very obvious because of the amount of design change and the
like, which had been discussed between the parties since
November, that the
scope of works, which would be incorporated into a final contract, would have
to have differed from that which
was still current as at 17 November
1993?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Depends on the value of the contract you're talking about.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Yes.  Assuming for the moment . . . that the ongoing discussions between
the parties was meant to be reflective of and definitive
of the works that were
to be done.  It was obvious that the scope of works had to be amended from that
which was still current as
at 17 November 1993, though?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	The scope of works had to be agreed.  The only scope of works which I
agreed to was the 17 November scope of works.  I didn't agree
to change
that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And can I suggest to you that it would have been rather obvious that the
reason why Mr O'Connell handed you a scope of works prior
to 18 May was for you
to look at it and . . .</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I've got no recollection of what he said to me when he gave me that
document.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	I understand that you say that, but what you understand is that you were
given a scope of works prior to 18 May?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	As I said yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And we take it that you didn't look at it at all before 18 May?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No. . . . No I didn't look at it . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Can I suggest to you that it was obvious at the time, whatever Mr
O'Connell said to you or didn't say to you, that one thing was
possible for you
to do was to look at the scope of works to see what was in it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I had no reason to believe the scope of works had changed from 17
November, the scope of works that we were going to be asked to
do under our
contract.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	All I'm suggesting to you is that you could have looked at it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I could have.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And whatever be the precise date on which you were given the document,
you had plenty of time to look at it before 18 May?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I don't recall when I got it so I don't know how much time I had.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You know what the scope of works in the 18 May contract looks like, don't
you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you'd agree that it only takes ten minutes to look at it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It - if you look at it, it looks different, but you have to read it
carefully to see the consequences of it.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It's not a difficult document to understand though, is it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Some parts of it take some thinking.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Can I suggest to you that this is a document - that is, the one you were
given by Mr O'Connell - that it was important for you
to look at at the
time?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Only if I was aware that the scope of works was going to be
changed.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>If one thing was clear in this project it was clear that the
detail of the project and the design of the project was not
constant</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>And if anything was clear about this project it was clear that
change was a feature of it?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Can I suggest to you in that context that it was absolutely essential
that you take whatever steps you thought sufficient to acquaint
yourself with
the scope of works handed to you prior to final contract time?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I didn't believe so . . .'    </i>[T314 and following]

<b>16 May 1994  Wards' Site Meeting  [J17]</b>
<P>

187   	On 16 May 1994, a Wards site meeting was held at 2.30pm.
The minutes of this site meeting include the following:
<P>

<i>`2.1  Overall Construction Programme to be finalised with C&amp;C . . .
[Action TN;  By 17/5]</i>
<P>

<i>12.4	GC reports that the [plus/minus] register shows us being in front at
this stage.'</i>
<P>

<b>18 May 1994 - Formal Subcontract executed  [J18]</b>
<P>

188   	The formal subcontract was executed on 18 May 1994.
<P>

189   	The subcontract was signed by Mr Cherrie on behalf of
Wards.  Between January and May 1994, Mr Cherrie had said to Mr O'Connell
on a
number of occasions, `Where is our contract', to be told `The contract is with
Roger Dias, who is writing some fancy words in
relation to partnering'.
<P>

190   	In late April or early May 1994, Mr Cherrie had a
conversation with Mr Crangle of Civil and Civic.  Mr Crangle said to Mr
Cherrie
words to the effect, `Glenn, I've managed to pull a few strings to get you paid
above the value of your contract for early
works, but no more payments can be
made until the contract is signed'.
<P>

191   	On 16 May 1994, Mr Cherrie had attended a partnering
meeting with representatives of Civil and Civic and had been advised
that the
contract would be ready for signing on 18 May 1994.
<P>

192   	On 18 May 1994, Mr Cherrie attended the offices of Civil
and Civic to sign the contract and was handed the contract by Mr
Knight of
Civil and Civic.  Mr Cherrie took the document and said to Mr Knight words to
the effect `Where are the fancy words that
Roger Dias was going to add about
partnering?'
<P>

193   	Mr Knight said `There is nothing in there.  We didn't put
them in'.
<P>

194   	Importantly, Mr Cherrie then signed the contract without
examining its contents.  His recollection was that he believed that
the delays
in producing the contract had been completely unnecessary, given that no
clauses relating to `partnering' had been added.
<P>

195   	Although Mr Cherrie in his first statement, had given
evidence that when he signed the contract, he believed that it contained
the
same terms and conditions, specifications and scope of works as had been
supplied to Wards for the purpose of tendering and on
which, on his
understanding, had formed the basis of Wards' acceptance of the offer of
$16.7million, this evidence must yield to
the concessions which he made under
cross-examination.
<P>

196   	The definitions clause in the Subcontract included the
following:
<P>

<i>`Client' means the three parties with C&amp;C to the Head Contract,
namely</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	Lend Lease Water Services Pty Limited;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	Lyonnaise (Prospect) Pty Limited;  and</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	P&amp;O (Prospect) Pty Limited</i>
<P>

<i>trading as the Prospect Water Partnership</i>
<P>

<i>`Substantial Works Completion' means when:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the Works or a Stage are complete except for minor omissions and minor
defects:</i>
<P>

<i>(1)	which do not prevent the Works or the Stage from being reasonably
capable of being used for its intended purpose;</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	in relation to which C&amp;C determines that the Contractor has
reasonable grounds for not promptly correcting them;</i>
<P>

<i>(3)	the making good of which will not prejudice the convenient use of the
Works or the Stage;  and</i>
<P>

<i>(4)	which do not cause a legal impediment to the use of the Works or the
Stage.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	those tests which are required by the Contract to be carried out and
passed before the Works or the Stage are handed over to C&amp;C
have been
carried out and passed;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	materials, documents and other information required under the contract
which are reasonably necessary for the use, operation and
maintenance of the
Works or the Stage, have been supplied to C&amp;C;</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	warranties which the Contractor is required to provide under this
Contract for the Works or the Stage have been supplied;  and</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	the matters referred to in the Appendix have been completed . . .</i>
<P>

<i>`"Variation" means any of the following:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	an increase or decrease in or omissions from the Works;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	a change in the character or quality of material or work;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	a change in the levels, lines, positions or dimensions of a part of the
Works;</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	execution of additional work;</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	a change to the nature or scope of the Works which results from a
direction or instruction issued to C&amp;C under the Head Contract
. .
.'</i>
<P>

197   	Clause 6.10 was in the following terms:
<P>

<i>`6.10.	</i><cite>Variations by C&amp;C</cite>
<P>

<i>6.10.1	C&amp;C, by written notice, may instruct a variation at any time
prior to the Date of Substantial Completion of the Contract
and the Contractor
must comply promptly with that instruction within the time specified by
C&amp;C.  The Contractor will not be entitled
to payment for a variation unless
the Contractor first provides C&amp;C with a copy of a written instruction from
C&amp;C to execute
the variation.</i>
<P>

<i>6.10.2	If the Contractor considers that a drawing, instruction or direction
issued by C&amp;C, although not stated to involve a variation,
in fact involves
a variation then the Contractor must give written notice to C&amp;C before
commencing work in relation to the drawing,
instruction or direction.
Compliance with this Clause will be a condition precedent to any claim the
Contractor may have for a variation.</i>
<P>

<i>6.10.3	The Contractor will not be entitled to a payment for a variation
under this Clause 6.10 in repsect [sic] of a Design Development
Variation.'</i>
<P>

198   	Clause 6.30 was headed `Design Development' and was in
the following terms:
<P>

<i>`6.30.1	The Contractor acknowledges that:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the design of the Works is not finalised and further development of the
design will be undertaken by C&amp;C;  and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the development of the design may result in changes to the Works
(`Design Development Variations') including matters which would
otherwise
constitute variations;</i>
<P>

<i>6.30.2	Notwithstanding any other term of this Contract C&amp;C will not be
liable for any loses suffered by the Contractor in connection
with and no
adjustment will be made to the Contract Sum in respect of any Design
Development Variation except to the extent that
C&amp;C receives payment for
the Design Development Variation under the Head Contract.</i>
<P>

<i>6.30.3	If an amount is payable to the Contractor under Clause 6.30.2, the
amount shall be determined under Clause 10.4 but shall in
no circumstances
exceed the amount payable to C&amp;C under the Head Contract in respect of the
Design Development Variation.'</i>
<P>

199   	The Scope of Works to the Subcontract is dated 12 April
1994, covers a number of pages and is followed by a number of schedules
including a `Schedule of Contract Programme', a `Schedule of Substantial
Completion' and a `Schedule of Drawings'.  These are together
appended as
Appendix J.
<P>

200   	By clause 16 of the Subcontract the early works contract
was expressed to be `included in this Contract and . . . thereby
cancelled'.
<P>

<b>17 June 1994  Subcontract entered into between Wards and Hornick
Constructions Pty Limited  [J21]</b>
<P>

201   	On 17 June 1994, a formal Subcontract was entered into
between Wards and Hornick Constructions.  The contract terms make
quite plain
that the draftsman of this contract drew heavily on the 18th May 1994 contract.
This is clear from a comparison of the
two contracts which are generally in
very much the same terms save for some important minute changes to reflect that
this was not
the main contract.  Hence, for example, close care was taken to
alter the words which had been used in the May 1994 contract as appropriate.
 A
drafting of this 17 June 1994 contract could not have been undertaken without a
close examination of the May 1994 contract.  This
is for example, particularly
apparent by comparing clauses 6.30.1 and 6.30.2 of the 17 June 1994 Hornicks
contract with the same
clauses in the May 1994 contract - see in particular the
alterations from use in the May 1994 contract of the words `C&amp;C', to
use of
the words in the June 1994 Hornicks Subcontract, of the words `Client' and
`WCE'.
<P>

202   	Relevantly, the 17 June 1994 Hornicks Subcontract
included the following definitions:
<P>

<i>`"Client" means Civil &amp; Civic Pty Limited . . . and the three parties
with C&amp;C to the head contract namely:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	Lend Lease Water Services Pty Limited</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	Lyonnaise (Prospect) Pty Limited, and</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	P&amp;O (Prospect) Pty Limited</i>
<P>

<i>trading as Prospect Water Partnership . . .</i>
<P>

<i>"Main contract" means the contract between P Ward Civil Engineering Pty
Limited ("WCE") and C&amp;C.</i>
<P>

<i>"Substantial completion" means when :</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the Works or a Stage are complete except for minor omissions and minor
defects:</i>
<P>

<i>1.	which do not prevent the Works or the Stage from being reasonably capable
of being used for its intended purpose,</i>
<P>

<i>2.	in relation to which WCE determines that the Subcontractor has reasonable
grounds for not promptly correcting them,</i>
<P>

<i>3.	the making good of which will not prejudice the convenient use of the
Works or the Stage;  and</i>
<P>

<i>4.	which do not cause a legal impediment to the use of the Works or the
Stage.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	those tests which are required by the Subcontract to be carried out and
passed before the Works or the Stage are handed over to
WCE and have been
carried out and passed.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	materials, documents and other information required under the
Subcontract which are reasonably necessary for the use, operation
and
maintenance of the works or the stage, had been supplied to WCE.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	warranties which the Subcontractor is required to provide under this
Subcontract for the works or the stage have been supplied;
 and</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	the matters referred to in the Appendix have been completed. . .</i>
<P>

<i>"variation" means any of the following:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	an increase or decrease in or omissions from the Works.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	a change in the character or quality of material or work.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	a change in the levels, lines, positions or dimensions of a part of the
Works.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	execution of additional work.</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	a change to the nature or scope of the Works which results from a
direction or instruction issued to WCE under the Main Contract.'</i>
<P>

203   	Clause 6.10 is entitled `Variations by WCE' and reads:
<P>

<i>'6.10.1	WCE, by written notice may instruct a variation at any time prior to
the Date of Substantial Completion of the Subcontract
and the Subcontractor
must comply promptly with that instruction within the time specified by WCE.
The Subcontractor will not be
entitled to payment for a variation unless the
Subcontractor first provides WCE with a copy of a written instruction from WCE
to
execute the variation.</i>
<P>

<i>6.10.2	If the Subcontractor considers that a drawing, instruction or
direction issued by WCE, although not stated to involve a variation,
in fact
involves a variation then the Subcontractor must give written notice to WCE
before commencing work in relation to the drawing,
instruction or direction.
Compliance with this clause will be a condition precedent to any claim the
Subcontractor may have for a
variation.</i>
<P>

<i>6.10.3	The Subcontractor will not be entitled to a payment for a variation
under this clause 6.10 in respect of a Design Development
Variation.'</i>
<P>

204   	Clause 6.30 was entitled `Design Development' and read as
follows:
<P>

<i>`6.30.1	The Subcontractor acknowledges that :</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the design of the Works is not finalised and further development of the
design will be undertaken by the Client;  and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the development of the design may result in changes to the Works
(`Design Development Variations') including matters which would
otherwise
constitute variations.</i>
<P>

<i>6.30.2	Notwithstanding any other term of this Subcontract WCE will not be
liable for any losses suffered by the Subcontractor in connection
with and no
adjustment will be made to the Subcontract sum in respect of any Design
Development Variation except to the extent that
WCE receives payment for the
Design Development Variation under the Main Contract.</i>
<P>

<i>6.30.3	If an amount is payable to the Subcontractor under clause 6.30.2, the
amount shall be determined under clause 10.4 but shall
in no circumstances
exceed the amount payable to WCE under the Main Contract in respect of the
Design Development Variation.'</i>
<P>

<b>20 June 1994  Letter from Mr Aldis to Mr Pittolo  [J18A]</b>
<P>

205   	On 20 June 1994, Mr Aldis wrote to Mr Pittolo advising
inter alia:
<P>

<i>`Re Prospect Water Filtration Plant Design Programme</i>
<P>

<i>I have been attending your design meetings with C&amp;C and their designers
PWG since 15 April 1994 and believe it appropriate to
make the following
comments with respect to design information and also some general comments . .
.</i>
<P>

<i>I have not reviewed your contract in detail, but from conversations with
yourself have assumed that there is little contractual protection
for Wards for
delay costs other than those awarded to Civil &amp; Civic by their clients.  I
further understand that there is a long
standing relationship with Civil &amp;
Civic which has resulted in a satisfactory outcome for Wards and as such the
preservation
of this relationship is most important . . ..'</i>
<P>

206   	The letter was copied to Mr Cherrie.
<P>

<b>21 June 1994  Monthly Project Review Meeting number 4  [J19]</b>
<P>

207   	On 21 June 1994, the fourth monthly project review
meeting was held on site and attended by a number of representatives of
Wards
and Civil and Civic.  The minutes record that the previous minutes were
reviewed and found to be a true and accurate record
of the meeting.  The
minutes also include the following item:
<P>

<i>`6.4	Plus/Minus Register</i>
<P>

<i>This is now to be reviewed only on an as needs basis, PWCE and C&amp;C
expressed a desire for all the focus to be reduced in this
area and directed
towards procurement management.  Mutual satisfaction of the [plus/minus
register] was expressed.'</i>
<P>

<b>5 July 1994  Letter from Mr Aldis to Mr Cherrie  [J20]</b>
<P>

208   	By letter dated 5 July 1994, Mr Aldis wrote to Mr Cherrie
advising inter alia:
<P>

<i>`On 22 June 1994 I communicated some observations to Max and yourself re the
progress of design information and programme on your
contract for the Prospect
Water Filtration Plant, in particular:</i>
<P>

<i>- The provision of design information was slipping behind.</i>
<P>

<i>Whereas you do not have the responsibility for design, you carry the risk of
the cost of design development, and also the cost of
delay other than that
recovered by Civil and Civic . . .'</i>
<P>

<b>Letter from Tress Cocks and Maddox to Civil and Civic of 21 June 1995</b>
<P>

209   	By letter dated 21 June 1995, Tress Cocks and Maddox, on
the instructions of Wards, wrote to Civil and Civic.  The letter
covered
alleged complaints of Wards in relation to the project.  The letter is appended
to the Judgment as Appendix K.  It dealt
with a number of issues.
<P>

210   	In so far as the letter dealt with the early works
contract, it read inter alia:
<P>

<i>`However, the contract document which was executed on our client's behalf on
7 February 1994 was substantially different from the
document our client had
been provided with in August 1993.  In particular there were the following
differences:</i>
<P>

<i>1.	Clauses 6.10.3 and 6.30 provided that our client acknowledged that the
design of the works was unfinished and that our client was
not entitled to
claim payment for a variation in respect of Design Development Variations.
This was contrary to information previously
provided to our client and in this
regard we refer you to our client's letter to Civil and Civic dated 17 November
1993 which reflects
our client's understanding that the design would be
</i><cite>virtually</cite><i> complete by 21 January 1994.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	Clause 10.1 was amended so that our client was no longer entitled to
adjustments in price in accordance with rates specified by
our client in its
bill of quantities.</i>
<P>

<i>3.	Clause 10.12 had been amended so that our client was said to be liable
for liquidated damages, as opposed to unliquidated damages
in the August 1993
document.</i>
<P>

<i>Clearly our client should have been advised that these changes were proposed
so that it could appropriately adjust its contract price.'
 </i>[Emphasis
added]
<P>

211   	The same letter stated in relation to the May 1994
contract inter alia, as follows:
<P>

<i>`In May 1994 our client once again was asked to execute a contract document
so as to enable payment of a further progress claim. 
As Civil and Civic was
aware, settlement of the World Square litigation was still not complete and our
client needed the progress
payment urgently.  Once again a director of our
client attended Civil and Civic's offices and executed a contract document.
The actual
body of the contract document was similar to the document executed
by our client in February 1994 but once again material changes
had been made to
the document without our client's attention being drawn to those changes.
These were:</i>
<P>

<i>1.	Clause 9.8.4 had been amended so as to prevent our client from receiving
any extensions of time as a result of any Design Development
Variations;
and</i>
<P>

<i>2.	A new scope of works was attached to the contract document.  This
included works which had been specifically deleted from our client's
scope of
works between August 1993 and November 1993 and did not take into account
detailed agreements reached during the same period.</i>
<P>

<i>Clearly these changes should have been brought to our client's attention so
that it could appropriately amend its contract price.</i>
<P>

<i>Our client did not review the documents executed in May 1994 until some time
in or about November 1994 when it was first brought to
our client's attention
by Civil and Civic that the May 1994 documents contained provisions which were
not included in the material
on which our client based its TGMP proposal . .
.</i>
<P>

<i>. . . Further, Civil and Civic's interpretation of what is constituted by a
Design Development Variation contradicts specific representations
made to our
client about this matter by Greg Robinson . . .'</i>
<P>

<b>Witnesses and `Credit'</b>
<P>

212   	It is next appropriate to turn to the evidence given by
the witnesses before the Court.  It is not necessary to set out all
of that
evidence.  Essentially, much of the cross-examination was carefully structured.
Mr Finch, Senior Counsel for Civil and Civic
took each of the plaintiff's
witnesses through the same core materials and then put precisely the same
propositions or propositions
to the same purport, to each of those witnesses.
To my mind, a reasonably detailed summary of the evidence of Messrs Ward and
Cherrie
should suffice to enable a reader of the Judgment to follow the
pattern.  The evidence of later witnesses may be referred to as such
evidence
impacts on particular issues.  The subjective state of mind of those involved
up to the execution of the May 1994 subcontract
was clearly relevant to a
number of the causes of action pleaded.  A clear pattern of acceptance by the
plaintiff's witnesses of
key propositions put to them in cross-examination as
to their understanding of the arrangements, was clearly established.  This is
not to say that each of the plaintiff's witnesses gave precisely the same
evidence, clearly there were differences.  But in the main,
the central
propositions for which Civil and Civic contends, as matters of fact, were
accepted by these witnesses.  Naturally, not
all of the plaintiff's witnesses
were relevant actors at the same points in time in relation to the events dealt
with each of the
documents put to the witnesses as will become apparent.
<P>

213   	To my mind, this is a case in which the facts may
essentially be gleaned from the contemporaneous records tendered in evidence.
Neither party submitted that any witness called by the other gave evidence
which was knowingly false or incorrect.  Both parties
accepted that each
witness had carried out their best endeavours to recall the events in question.
Each party submitted that where
evidence given by the other parties witnesses
was suggested to be incorrect, this should simply be accepted as being a
situation
in which the events in question having taken place many years ago,
recollections were incorrect or faulty as often occurs.  Hence
at the end of
the day, although questions of reliability of evidence were raised, it became
and is unnecessary for the Court to decide
whether to believe any particular
witness in terms of `credit' seen as a challenge to `honesty' in giving
evidence.  Where reliability
issues are raised, the Court's findings on those
matters will appear from what follows.
<P>

214   	Following discussions between Counsel in relation to
initial objections proposed to be taken to sections of statements, a
measure of
agreement was reached which avoided the objections being pressed.  The
agreement related to objections which had been
proposed to be pressed on the
basis that parts of relevant paragraphs in witnesses' statements constituted
conclusions of law.  The
agreement which was reached at the Bar table as to
these objections not being pressed, orders that the Court would regard such
statements
which comprised conclusions of law where appearing, as the
expression of the relevant deponents' view and as not proving any other
matter.
[See transcript of 22 June 1999 page 12]
<P>

<b>Evidence given by Mr Peter Ward</b>
<P>

215   	Mr Ward did not recall seeing document J1 in June 1992.
He was, however, aware that in 1992 Civil and Civic had invited a
tender from
Wards in respect of earthworks for the project and accepted that from his
elevated role in the company, documents such
as the appendices, conditions and
a blank subcontract would not necessarily be copied to him in the first
instance.  [T14]
<P>

216   	As to the form of the subcontract, part of document J1,
Mr Ward had no recollection of going through the document but accepted
that it
appeared to be a subcontract in blank, that is full of blank items, none of
which had been filled in to adapt the draft subcontract
to the particular
proposed Contract.
<P>

217   	Mr Ward also accepted that the Appendix was in blank and
essentially that there was nothing to distinguish the draft subcontract
from
any other standard form of Civil and Civic draft subcontract so far as he could
recall.  He had become reasonably familiar with
Civil and Civic's draft
subcontracts during his long experience in the industry.  It was not in recent
years part of Mr Ward's job
description to spend too much time going through,
page by page, subcontracts which were exchanged for the purpose of Wards'
performing
work.  His involvement was usually at a much higher level of
generality.  He might be involved in such things as the discussion of
the total
contract sum involved and other important conditions but he accepted that he
would certainly not have been involved with
matters of what one might call
`contract administration'.  This was true in the case of the subcontract in
1992 in which year he
did not discuss any of these documents including the
subcontract with anyone either within Wards or at Civil and Civic.  [T15]
<P>

218   	As to document J2, the submission of Wards' preliminary
final assessment to Civil and Civic, giving a total lump sum of $16.9million,
Mr Ward was not personally involved in any way with the actual production or
reading of the document and did not become involved
at all in relation to the
actual fixing of the lump sum.  [T16]
<P>

219   	Mr Ward did, however, in paragraph 7 of his first
statement of 18 August 1998, give evidence that he had telephoned Mr Garling
of
Civil and Civic on about 25 June 1992 when a conversation to the following
effect had taken place:
<P>

<i>`Mr Ward:	Phil, my company is going through a very difficult project of a
similar nature but smaller than Prospect.  We are working
for CBI on a
$16million water treatment plant called Cascade in the Blue Mountains near
Katoomba.  In this plant we are carrying
out all the concrete and
earthworks.</i>
<P>

<i>There are substantial blow outs in cost and time.  One of the major problems
was that as work progressed the working drawings contained
substantially more
work.  Bigger concrete tanks, more reinforcing steel and concrete, valves and
pits added to pipelines, more concrete
structures.</i>
<P>

<i>CBI seemed to have no control over the consulting engineers either as to
quality or timeliness.</i>
<P>

<i>I note we are pricing the works [referring to the Prospect Water Treatment
Works] based on preliminary drawings and I recommend that
substantial
contingencies be allowed and furthermore, it is essential that Civil and Civic
control the design engineers.'</i>
<P>

220   	Mr Ward's evidence was that Mr Garling had said words to
the effect:  `Thanks for the call but whatever you do don't bury
contingencies
in your rates, spell them out separately.  We don't want both parties allowing
for contingencies and as a result, we
would price ourselves out of a job.  We
will make allowance for those contingencies'.  [Para 7 First Statement 18
August 1998]
<P>

221   	Mr Ward was not involved in the matters referred to on
page 2 of document J2.  [T17]
<P>

222   	Mr Ward was not involved with the production of document
J3.  Given the level of his involvement in the company, he was not
consulted
about the content of J3 as this was left to others in the company.  [T18]
<P>

223   	Mr Ward had read document J6, the 3 August 1993 letter to
Wards.  He gave evidence that his understanding having read paragraphs
2 and 3
of document J6, was `that our participation in design development was to
originate from us and we had to outline our proposals
in our tender and that
our input was to be particular in buildability and construction technique.  I
noted that we would get any
savings from our input and felt that Civil and
Civic were really trying to help us.  However, I was aware that any proposals
would
have to be approved by the consulting engineers.  As I understood it, the
design development proposals were to come from us or from
Civil and Civic and
that the purpose of the proposals was to achieve savings in the cost of
carrying out our work.'  [First statement
para 9]
<P>

224   	Mr Ward accepted that he understood the terms of document
J6 when it was received and had no difficulty in understanding
those terms.  He
did not think there was anything in it which confused him or caused him to
query anything in the document with anyone.
 As to the fifth paragraph of
document J6, Mr Ward was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Stopping there for a moment, your familiarity with the standard terms of
subcontract which [sic] forwarded by Civil and Civic
was such that you would
have been aware as at 3 August that it did not include any term to the effect
of paragraph 5 of this letter,
did it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I wouldn't have thought so at the time.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	This, so far as you were concerned, was something novel from Civil and
Civic in terms of this standard subcontract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	The words are novel.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You are not able, can I suggest to you, to point to any term in the draft
subcontract which has the effect of what's set out in
paragraph 5 of this
letter?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No not to my knowledge . . .'</i>[T19]
<P>

225   	Mr Ward had not mentioned the paragraph numbered 6 in
document J6 in his statement.  In this regard, he was asked and answered
as
follows under cross-examination:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Can I suggest to you when you read it, it was clear to you that that
paragraph was expressing what would happen in the event that
you contracted
with Civil and Civic?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That was clear at the time you read it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And secondly, what was clear was that in the event that Civil and Civic
contracted with you, any risk associated with further Design
Development after
the time of contracting, was to be borne by Wards unless a certain circumstance
prevailed?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You understood that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.'  </i>[T20]
<P>

226   	At transcript page 22, Mr Ward gave evidence that what he
was trying to say was that Wards were not responsible for design
completion but
were responsible for `design development'.  He then accepted at transcript page
23, that there was nothing in the
letter J6 that he understood at the time to
modify or in any way affect what was set out in paragraph 6 and that his
understanding
of the proposed contractual relationship insofar as variations
were concerned, at the time he read J6, was as follows:
<P>

<i>`. . . that where the design was not complete, any additional work to the
completion of design would be paid for as a variation.'
 </i>[T23]
<P>

227   	He was then asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Do I take it from that answer that it was, at this time - and indeed was
at all times - your understanding of the proposed contractual
relationship
between the parties that there would be a variation claimable in Wards?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes I believe that we had the ability to claim for variation.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	When you read this letter it would have been very clear to you . . . and
was clear to you that such as a term necessary to reflect
what is in paragraph
6 would need to be added to the draft Subcontract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It was not your understanding, I suggest, as at 3 August, that Civil and
Civic's standard form contract said anything about what
is expressed in
paragraph 6?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So that it was clear to you that there would be another or extra or
different term added to complete the contractual relationship
between the
parties on the subject matter dealt with within paragraph 6?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I didn't see that was necessary.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Why not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Because I was of the view that you could incorporate the letter in the
contract.'  </i>[T23]
<P>

228   	Mr Ward also answered questions as follows in relation to
paragraph 6 of J6:
<P>

<i>`Q.	You see paragraph 6 is prefaced by the words `If we contract with you .
. .'?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It's plainly, I suggest to you, looking forward to what will be the
contractual relationship between the parties at some time in
the future if it
lapses?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It was plain to you, was it not, that it was necessary for the proper
regulation of affairs between Ward and C&amp;C that any such
term such as that
set out in paragraph 6, should be part of that contract expressly?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I didn't have any consideration to that at the time.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You just didn't turn your mind to it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You would agree, would you not, looking back on it now, that as a matter
of elementary contractual administration, that terms such
as this where they
appear in prefatory correspondence, should be incorporated into an agreed
contractual term . . .  </i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>'  
<P>

[T23-24]
<P>

229   	Mr Ward accepted that Wards, as far as he knew, at no
stage had written any letter to Civil and Civic saying that it did
not accept
paragraph 6 of the letter of 3 August.  He was asked and answered as
follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Wards accepted, didn't it, that paragraph 6 was a term which either did
or was to govern the contractual relationship between
the parties?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I accepted that.'  </i>[T25]
<P>

230   	Mr Ward accepted that it was important in his view to
make sure that there were processes whereby subcontractors in the position
of
Wards should be able to keep track of the design development as they occurred
by keeping a record.  [T25]
<P>

231   	Mr Ward accepted that the design meetings were held to
inform Wards and for Wards to inform Civil and Civic of proposed design
changes.  [T25]
<P>

232   	Mr Ward had left the function of being involved in the
detail of the design meetings to others.
<P>

233   	Mr Ward had difficulty recalling precisely what he knew
at the time in relation to meetings between the parties because it
was
difficult he found, to distinguish between what he knew at the time he was
giving evidence and what he knew previously.  He did,
however, accept that he
knew that there were meetings whereby Wards put forward its proposals for
design development.  He also knew
that there were meetings whereby the
designers were answering queries on various drawings.  [T26]
<P>

234   	Apart from events at the project meeting of 15 March
1994, Mr Ward accepted that it was a fair reflection of what he recalled
that
by the time the Subcontract was signed on 18 May 1994, it had not come to his
attention that there had been any significant
level of design change.  [T27]
<P>

235   	Mr Ward was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	. . . You personally . . . you weren't in a position to make any
decision as at 18 May 1994 about the exposure that Wards may
have had pursuant
to the term which is foreshadowed in paragraph 6 of the letter of 3 August . .
.  You personally were not in a
position as at 18 May to be able to consider
and assess the level of risk, if any, to which Wards was exposed as a result of
that
proposed term?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes I think you are correct.</i>'  [T27]
<P>

236   	Throughout the period August to May, Mr Ward accepted
that `there was, as one of the terms of the relationship between the
parties -
whether it arose by exchange of correspondence or whether it arose by way of
contract - a term such as that in paragraph
6 of [J6] . . ., and that continued
to be [his] understanding throughout that time.'  [T27]  Mr Ward had not
himself been concerned
with the detail in relation to the documents enclosed
with document J6 and his evidence was that it was Mr Levido's task at Wards
to
concern himself with that level of detail.  [T28]
<P>

237   	Mr Ward had not looked at the blank subcontract forming
part of the enclosures to J6, for example to see whether it had been
amended to
put in something to reflect paragraph 6 of the  3 August letter.  [T28]
<P>

238   	The candidates whose task it may have been to look into
this matter were probably Mr Levido but could have included Mr Niederberger,
Mr
Pittolo or Mr Cherrie.  [T29]
<P>

239   	As to document J7, Mr Ward had not seen and was not
consulted in relation to this document.  He accepted, however, that the
word
`variation' was used in the third paragraph of document J6 in a somewhat loose
fashion.  [T30]  He accepted that the document
at PX 3 page 366 summarised the
pricing of different kinds of work at differing times.
<P>

240   	Mr Ward was not consulted in relation to the contract
conditions enclosed with J7.  He had not read the contract conditions
enclosed
with J7 either at the time nor at any time up to and including 18 May 1994.  He
was not in a position to know whether or
not Civil and Civic accepted those
proposed conditions as at 18 May 1994.  He was unable to point to any document
where Civil and
Civic did accept those terms.  He did not know whether or not
the terms were reflected in the 18 May 1994 Contract at the time. 
He was asked
and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And presumably those who wrote this document would have to take some
further steps to see whether or not these suggested terms
were accepted and
were incorporated . . .</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I accept I would have, yes.' </i> [T31]
<P>

241   	Mr Ward was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	As a matter of prudent contractual practice, you would have expected
your officers to take whatever steps were necessary to ascertain
that C&amp;C
had agreed, and to ascertain the terms found their way as to terms what is
described as the final contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I believe so.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Who was responsible for doing that at Wards?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	. . . It would be . . . Adrian Levido, but then it would be taken over by
the construction team.  Sometimes contracts are agreed
by the estimating
department.  Sometimes the construction people come in and get involved prior
to the contract's being formalised.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Are the names of the relevant candidates in no particular order of
precedent Mr Levido?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	He was in charge of preparing the tender.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	What would he have a role, in your view, in considering and assessing
whether or not suggested additional terms by Wards had been
agreed and
incorporated?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes he would have a role yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Mr Cherrie?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, in probably less detail.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Mr Niederberger</i>
<P>

<i>A.	In this case yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Mr Pittolo?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	In this case, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Mr Manion?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	. . . I'm not one hundred percent sure.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	He may have had a role, but you are not sure?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I know he had a role in the preparation of the tender.  From a technical
point of view he wasn't one of the company's estimators.
 Adrian Levido was the
chief estimator.  Dick Glasgow was another estimator involved who was a full
time estimator.  Mike Manion
was on secondment on leave with a view of going
onto the site.  This job was slightly different in that in most cases we do not
start
work until the contract is signed, so in most cases people like Max
Pittolo would probably not be involved.  It would be between
Adrian Levido and
then Glen Cherrie.  This is complicated by the fact that in this particular
case we have the contract before the
contract was signed.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Mr Glasgow's name was the last name I was going to suggest to you as a
possible candidate for membership of the team who might
have been responsible
to ascertain there might have been an agreement to and incorporate the
suggested terms of page 375?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Not to the same extent as Adrian Levido.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	But nevertheless a possible member?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	A possible member, yes, but I doubt it.'  </i>[T32]
<P>

242   	Mr Ward was then asked to look halfway down the contract
conditions page enclosed with J7.  This was the section headed `Variations'.
It was pointed out to Mr Ward that Wards had there suggested that Wards should
get the benefit of any change, no matter who suggested
it.  He was asked:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And no doubt an admirable suggestion, but you will concede, will you
not, that that's different to what is contained in the 3
August letter?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It's different to any knowledge I have.  I believe the actual case for
this was the August letter.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	This comes as somewhat of a surprise to you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	How do we resolve the tension between what is in the 3 August letter and
what is here?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I have no idea.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Before a final contract was entered into between the parties, that
tension would have to be resolved, wouldn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It would have been, I suggest to you, readily apparent to whoever drafted
this, that this was different to the 3 August letter?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I can't say I can comment on that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It was immediately apparent to you, wasn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It's apparent to me now that it is different from the August letter and I
have read this obviously, but I have only read this recently
and I really can't
make any comment on it.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	I think you have already said - and I haven't challenged you - that you
didn't read this at the time, and what I am suggesting
to you though, is that
it's clear, from even a cursory reading of what appears under that heading,
that it differs from what is in
the 3 August letter?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, that's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It differs in a number of respects.  I will point them out to you.
Firstly there is a difference to the suggestion about who gets
the benefit in
the event that Civil and Civic suggests a change?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, that's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	There is also an additional element which had not previously been in any
proposal, that in respect of certain names saving which
we see later on in this
document, Civil and Civic and Wards would share the benefit 50/50?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, I see it says that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That wasn't in the 3 August letter, was it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And it's saying, perhaps it's different, perhaps it's not, depending on
the degree of shorthand which is being used, "where variations
arise from
either client or Water Board directed works we expect full reimbursement", but
it doesn't say so long as Civil and Civic
gets paid, does it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, it doesn't.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So that's another difference on the face of it isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	On the face of the document, there are three major differences aren't
there?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	How were those differences resolved?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I don't know.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You know in this case it is suggested that by 17 November there is
concluded a contract between the parties which is subject only
to a small
number of things to be done?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	How, by 17 November, were these divergences between the parties
resolved?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I don't know.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You would accept, would you not, that they weren't resolved on the face
of the document upon which your company relies?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I don't know that either.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Are you able to point me to any company [sic] or agreement or any other
thing which resolves any of these three problems?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No I can't.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So far as you are aware, the matter simply wasn't resolved by 17
November?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No I can't point you to a document.  I don't know that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You weren't consulted about it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I wasn't consulted about this document, no. . . .</i>[T34]
<P>

243   	It was suggested to Mr Ward that while he was giving
evidence on 20 June, this was the first time he had had pointed out
to him the
differences between the Wards' proposals and the Civil and Civic proposals and
he accepted that no one had pointed them
out to him.  He had never heard of the
differences being discussed by anyone before.  [T35]
<P>

244   	In relation to the Risk Profile document, part of J7, and
the section of it dealing with the sub-head `Design Risk', Mr Ward
at T38,
accepted that it was now apparent to him that at least at that time, Wards'
staff apprehended that the design risk was appropriately
described as set out
on this page.
<P>

245   	Again at transcript 39, Mr Ward accepted that his
understanding at his level in the company was that paragraph 6 of the 3
August
letter then expressed and tended to express Ward's appreciation of the design
and development risk.
<P>

246   	Mr Ward was taken to the 17 November 1993 Wards' letter,
J9.  He was reminded that it is now suggested on behalf of Wards
that that
document formed the end of a chain of correspondence which constituted a
contract between Civil and Civic and Wards for
the work that Wards did.
[T40]
<P>

247   	Mr Ward had, in paragraphs 10 and 13 of his first
statement, deposed as follows:
<P>

<i>'10.	In early November 1993 Glen Cherrie as Managing Director was taking
over the leading role in the negotiations with Greg Robinson.
 On or about 15
November, Glenn was having a meeting in our office with Greg Robinson and he
came to see me and we had a conversation
to the following effect:</i>
<P>

<i>"It looks like all the structures are out and there will be about
$17.4million worth of work.  However, Civils want us to throw in
rise and fall
and knock off $600,000 from our price.  Greg reckons we should be able to get
$222,000 off Pacific Linings price, $189,000
off Hornicks and a couple of
hundred thousand off our price with Civils to supply a first aider.  He says he
will help us with Pacific
Lining Pty Limited and if we can't get Hornicks down
he will . . . "</i>
<P>

<i>13.	Glen Cherrie and I met with Greg Robinson, I think on the same day (i.e.
15 November) and had a conversation to the following
effect:</i>
<P>

<i>"I said  `Greg, our design development proposals have not yet been formally
agreed to and I still don't trust that you have control
of the designers.  I am
worried that it is a big ask to take $600,000 off our price and ask us to
include for rise and fall.</i>
<P>

<i>Greg:  `Don't worry about design development, we have the designers under
control, you should be able to make at least $1million on
top of what you
already have.'</i>
<P>

<i>Greg . . .  also said:  `I will be forming a partnering process with the
designers, yourselves and Civil and Civic and I will pay
bonuses to the
designers out of Civil and Civic's pocket for design savings.'</i>
<P>

<i>I said:  `What happens if we come up with proposals but the designers want
them gold plated with belt and braces?'</i>
<P>

<i>Greg said:  `We will be the arbitrators.  Civil and Civic run the
consultants and we will sort them out.  Don't worry, Civil and Civic
are
experts in design development and in managing consultants.'</i>
<P>

<i>I said:  `Glen tells me you want a couple of hundred thousand off both the
nominated liner' sub-contract and Hornicks.'</i>
<P>

<i>Greg said:  `The liner' subcontractor has plenty of fat in this price.  I
will help you there and if you can't get Hornicks down to
the right price, I
will.'</i>
<P>

248   	At transcript page 40, Mr Ward stated that the extent of
his involvement in discussions about J7 prior to the time it was
sent, were
those set out in paragraphs 10 and 13 of his statement.  He was then taken
through the way that the document J7 appears
to work.
<P>

249   	Mr Ward accepted at transcript page 44, that a number of
things were clear upon the writing of the J7 letter of 17 November
1993.  His
evidence was as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	. . . It was clear to you upon the writing of this letter that there was
to be a final contract in addition to the correspondence
up to that
time?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It was also clear that there was to be a period of an exchange of views
about design development leading up to that contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes. </i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It was also agreed that C&amp;C may or may not enter into a Contract with
Wards at the end of that period?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Nothing was promised to Wards by this time about C&amp;C entering into
any arrangement for the construction of anything?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Not that I had seen at the time. . . .'   </i>[T44]
<P>

250   	Mr Ward in being asked questions in relation to document
J8 and in particular questions relating to the sentence in that
letter from
Wards in paragraph 3, reading:
<P>

<i>`It is confirmed that these issues must be considered concurrently in order
to offset the potentially large windfall wins and losses.'</i>
<P>

He was asked as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Windfall wins and losses means, does it not, the potential exposure of
Wards to a plus situation or a minus situation in respect
of its exposure to
the lump sum contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's what the letter appears to say.'    </i>[T47]
<P>

251   	It was then put to Mr Ward that document J8 is one of the
documents relied upon by Wards on the pleadings said to constitute
the contract
between Wards and C&amp;C.  The following questions were put:
<P>

<i>`Q.	. . . You are alleging that this [J8] is one of the documents that
constitutes the end of the process?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	If you are asking me that is part of the documents which culminated in an
agreement in November I say yes, it is part.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Now the document clearly, does it not, sets out that Wards, through its
officers, appreciated that there were potentially large
windfall wins and
losses?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Again I am not sure if you mean windfall wins or losses or windfall wins
and losses.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That does not perhaps matter so much, they are Wards' wins and losses,
aren't they?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes that's what it says.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And they are wins and losses as measured against the lump sum contract
exposure?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Otherwise it doesn't mean anything, does it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So that the understanding of Wards, so far as you now know, looking at
the documents executed by your officers, was that Wards
would have a
potentially large windfall win or loss measured against the lump sum contract
which was to be entered into?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's what the document says.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you don't disagree with the document do you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I don't disagree that the document forms part of the procedure in the
contract.'   </i>[T47-48]
<P>

252   	At transcript page 49, Mr Ward was asked to accept that
it is plain from the whole of document J8 that Mr Manion who signed
the letter,
had made plain in the letter that design was a risk.  Mr Ward accepted that
this was the case.
<P>

253   	At transcript 49, Mr Ward was taken to the sections of
the document J8 entitled `Risk Profile' and in particular to the section
A
sub-paragraph 3 under the sub-title `Delayed or Inadequate Design'.  He was
asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Have a look at the previous page in item 3, do you see it is headed
"There are other matters related to risk which have not been
mentioned above,
including item 3, including design?  You will see at the bottom of the page
"Should delays of this nature, that
is insufficient or adequate design,
eventuate" it is understood this risk is a responsibility of Civil and
Civic?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

. . .
<P>

<i>Q.	Again, we are only talking in terms of the development of the contract
here?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Do you agree that that is not something which is referred to in the 3
August letter?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No it's not.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	How is that tension resolved, that is the tension of the 3 August letter
and what is set out in this letter?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I don't know.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Was it resolved before 17 November?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I don't know.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Can you point us to any document in what are said to be the contractual
documents by Wards which resolves that tension?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It was something outstanding as at 17 November, wasn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	So far as these documents are concerned it would appear to be.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It is not in the draft subcontract which was exchanged between the
parties, is it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So that this is another indicator, can I suggest to you, that the parties
were looking forward to the preparation of a final contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And that none of them thought or could have reasonable thought that the
17th November was the end of that process?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's correct.'   </i>[T49-50]
<P>

254   	Mr Ward was taken to the document being the facsimile
from Wards to Civil and Civic of 1 July 1992 [part of J2].  He was
shown the
paragraph numbered 7, earlier set out in this Judgment.  He accepted that it
was plain to him, looking at this document,
that there was a tension between
the two concepts, namely what constituted design development and what
constituted a variation, a
tension which relevant members of Wards' staff
appreciated.  [T52]
<P>

255   	Mr Ward was aware at the time he was being
cross-examined, that there is in the 18 May 1994 contract, a specific link
between
variation and design development.  [T52]
<P>

256   	At transcript page 53, Mr Ward accepted that any degree
of familiarities between the 3 August 1993 and 17 November 1993 letters
`would
have shown [him] that they forecast another document being exchanged by way of
formal contract between the parties in due
course'.
<P>

257   	Mr Ward had not been aware of the document J10 until
recently.  Under cross-examination, however, he gave the following evidence:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Now, by this time, you are aware from the documents that I have already
taken you to that there have been a number of expressions
by Wards of a desire
to have incorporated into any final contract certain terms different to those
in 3 August?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	What steps were taken by Wards to see whether or not that had happened by
the time this formal Subcontract referred to here was
executed?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I don't know.'    </i>[T58]
<P>

258   	As to the 7 February and `early works' subcontract, Mr
Ward's evidence was that he knew it was going on at the time but did
not
believe that he had any discussions with anyone about execution of that
subcontract.  His evidence was that his view at the time
was that the `early
works' subcontract was not an important document.  [T59]  His view was that it
was a means to a payment.  [T59]
<P>

259   	Mr Ward, however, accepted at transcript 60, that it was
not the practice of Wards to sign contracts whatever they say, to
get payments.
He accepted that Mr Keetley could have read the early works subcontract, had he
wanted to.  Indeed, any officer of
Wards, he accepted, could have read the
early works subcontract had they wanted to.  [T60]
<P>

260   	Mr Ward was asked what assumption was made by Wards at
the time of the signing of the early works subcontract as to what
had happened
to their suggested conditions in the 23 August letter.  His answer was that he
did not know.  He was asked:
<P>

<i>`Q.	At the very least, those concerned with the development of the
contractual terms at Wards had to have known that there was something
to be
resolved, do you not agree?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I am not sure that David Keetley would know but, yes, you are right in
the first statement, first part statement.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	As you have already agreed, one couldn't simply assume that C&amp;C would
simply agree with the things that Wards put in the letter?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Correct, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Anyone who had the smallest look at the letters, including those who
wrote them, would have to assume there was something to be
done by way of
agreement or before any such terms were incorporated?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	The people that wrote the letters, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And the people who wrote the letters and referred to the letters later on
included such people as Mr Levido?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And the letters which were written incorporating those documents were
copied to Mr Cherrie?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I don't know.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Anyone who reviewed on more than an absolutely cursory basis the chain of
letters from 3 August to 17 November would have been
alerted to the necessity
to look at the formal contract to see how those matters were resolved?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I would say so.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And the people who had suggested the things which need resolution were
Wards people?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	They weren't things that had been slipped in by C&amp;C were they?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.  . . .'  T60-61]</i>
<P>

261   	At transcript 62, in being taken to the use of the words
"further development" in clause 6.30.1(a) of the early works subcontract,
Mr
Ward was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Can I suggest to you that there is not a great deal of difference
between the expression "design development" and "further development
of the
design"?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	About seven million dollars difference.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Can I suggest to you there is no difference between those two
expressions?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Well, my understanding of English is that they are different but it is
just my perception.  You may be right.'   </i>[T62-63]
<P>

262   	At transcript 63, Mr Ward gave the following evidence
under cross-examination:
<P>

<i>`Q.	. . . What I am suggesting to you, though, is that you would accept the
proposition that there are references that I have taken
you to in the documents
from June 1992 all the way up to the time of this Contract which are consistent
with the existence of clauses
6.10 and 6.30 as they appear in this
contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	They are consistent from what your argument has been that there should be
a clause there relating to design of development variations.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It is just that you personally haven't been involved in a level of detail
sufficient to acquaint you with that correspondence leading
up to that
contract, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I was involved in sufficient detail as to the points that are made in my
statement and those points in my statement the staff of
Wards Engineering were
aware of at the time.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	But what you hadn't been informed about was the particular matters that
I've taken you through today?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No I wasn't informed of the various letters, that's correct . . . `
[T63]</i>
<P>

263   	At transcript 69, Mr Ward accepted that the plus/minus
register was a designs improvement opportunity, having as its original
purpose
a creation and maintenance by Wards for the purpose of tracking its exposure to
the lump sum.  Mr Ward was asked and answered
as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And it [the plus/minus register] tracked that exposure as it changed
from time to time because of, amongst other things, design
development?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, it recorded design development on it, amongst other things . .
.'</i>
<P>

264   	At transcript page 70, the following was put to Mr
Ward:
<P>

<i>`Q.	What I am suggesting to you is that there were variations which were
variations simpliciter, that is they weren't anything else
but
variations?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, that is the case.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And they were tracked on a variations register from April . . .</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, I wasn't involved at the time but I am aware of that now.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And I am suggesting to you that there are other things which, although
they might be thought to be variations, were also the subject
of the design
development tracking exercise in the plus/minus sheet?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes that's true.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And can I suggest to you that that process is entirely consistent with
Wards' understanding of the competition which existed between
variations and
design development matters . . .?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, it is not consistent with my views of the competition.  I have never
seen them, as I've said before, I've never seen it as
a competition between the
two things.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It is consistent though, you would accept, with the view which is
apparent from the correspondence I have taken you through today?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	The way you have explained it to me, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Can I suggest your lack of appreciation with this competition . . .  is
simply the product of not having been involved in the negotiation
of or the
finalisation of the contract between Wards and C&amp;C?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Except in the extent as set out in my statement.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Otherwise than that, you agree with me?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That I wasn't involved in the detail and negotiations, yes I agree with
that . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	What I am suggesting to you is the reason why you do not appreciate that
this process is reflective of a competition between design
development and
variation is because you had a lack of involvement in the production of the
contractual negotiations?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes that may be the case.</i>'    [T71]
<P>

265   	At transcript 73, Mr Ward accepted that he participated
to a limited degree in what was described as the detailed analysis
of the
plus/minus register.  It was referred to as a tracking exercise.  At transcript
75, Mr Ward's evidence was :
<P>

<i>`Q.	It is quite clear though that you weren't involved in the purpose or
project of tracking Wards' exposure to the lump sum by looking
at these things
in detail as they came out?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Somebody else at Wards was doing that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And who was it at Wards who was doing that for the most part do you
know?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I would think it would be Max Pittolo.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Mr Cherrie was a person with the role in looking at these as well can I
suggest to you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And it needed to be someone of sufficient seniority at Wards doing this
because the exposure of Wards to the lump sum was a matter
of some importance
to Wards?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Now, this tracking exercise continued right up to the time of the
contract on 18 May didn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	This was the only meeting that I was at but having read the document
since then yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you understand now that that tracking exercise continued right up to
the time of the May meeting?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.'   </i>[T 75]
<P>

266   	Mr Ward was taken to item 6.4 of the Monthly Project
Review Meeting No. 3 of 16 May, two days before the contract, [J16],
which in
relation to the plus/minus register had read, inter alia:
<P>

<i>`This is now to be reviewed only on an as needs basis.'</i>
<P>

267   	He was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Can I suggest to you that there is a very obvious reason why there was to
be a change turning on about 18 May to the dealings of
the plus/minus register
and that was from the time of contract onwards, design development risk was
Wards except in the circumstances
that we all know about where the head
contractor makes a change and that is the reason why this change in approach
was foreshadowed.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It is quite possible.'  [T79]</i>
<P>

268   	At transcript page 81, Mr Ward was asked and answered as
follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	So that by 18 May, you would concede would you not, that Wards staff
were aware of the various design alterations, if I can use
a neutral word, that
had been discussed and, in many cases, agreed up to that point . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	I am simply asking you to concede that Wards' staff, by virtue of their
attendance at those meetings, must have become aware of
the design development
alteration?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The reason why it is important for Wards to be at these meetings and to
appreciate the changes was, of course, that the project
had to be constructed
in accordance with the design as it evolved, not with the design as it was, for
instance, back in June 1992?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes that's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And it was important for Wards as a matter of its own contract
administration, to keep track of these design alterations so that
it could
properly address, for instance, the variations which it wanted to claim?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And also properly keep track, as it did in the plus/minus register, of
how these matters might affect the lump sum exposure?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, to the extent that the plus/minus - details of the plus/minus
register were proposals . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And the whole purpose - at least partly the purpose of the plus/minus
register - involved Wards looking into the future and making
an estimate of how
these things which might happen might affect them.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Leading up to the signing of the contract, can I suggest to you that
Wards increased its attention to the bottom line of the plus/minus
register?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I don't know.'  </i> [T81]
<P>

269   	Mr Ward gave evidence that he believed that Mr Aldis
worked for Mr Max Pittolo.  Mr Ward had never read the document J18A.
 Mr Ward
accepted that it was clear from the first paragraph of J18A that Mr Aldis
started in his duties on or about 15 April.  Mr
Ward accepted that when Mr
Aldis, halfway down page 1 of document J18A, had said:  `There are still many
areas of your contract where
design details are still required . . .',.  that
was reflective of the fact that Mr Ward was aware that as at 18 May the design
in
many areas was still not finalised.  [T85-86]
<P>

270   	Mr Ward was asked in relation to the documents J18A and
J20, the following questions:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Can I suggest to you that what is recorded in those two letters is
exactly the same as the risk exposure that Wards had been informed
of by
correspondence commencing in June 1992?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	As far as design development is concerned, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And it carries the same implications for the risk of delay, doesn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Well, that doesn't go back to July 1992, that's his observations of that
date and the previous date.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It may well be that a design development may result in a delay?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's possible.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And as plainly as can be, the correspondence since June 1992 said the
risk on design development was Wards after contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And the risk includes costs associated with the ramifications of design
development?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Design development itself does not cause any cost to Wards until it is
effected?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Other than the costs of the work in carrying out the design, the time
spent and so on.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	 . . . There may be some cost to Wards in actually moving lines around on
a drawing - I don't mean to be dismissive about the process
of actually
designing things but there may be cost to Wards in that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And there may be cost to Wards in revisiting what the ramifications of
that development is for other parts of the project?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Which may be depending, for instance, on that work?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, yes, that is possible yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	There may be ramifications for things like hand over dates?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	There shouldn't be.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It may be though that if one party, for instance, one work area party, is
waiting for completion of a particular part of the work?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I am sorry, we are talking about design development.  We would not
propose a design development or a design change that was going
to hold us
up.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	I'm not suggesting here that we are concerned only with proposals by
Wards?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I am sorry, I thought you were talking about ourselves.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	I am suggesting where you were at risk for design development, no matter
where the development change originated.  Now, with that
clarification, you
would agree, would you not, that design development might affect such things as
hand over?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	With that clarification, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you agreed yesterday - and no doubt you still agree - that there is
nothing in the 3 August letter, or indeed, any other letter,
that you could
point to which restricts Wards' risk on design development to development
suggested by Wards?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, you have drawn my attention to that, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you agree that that is true, don't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It would appear to be the case, yes.'  </i>[T90-92]
<P>

271   	Mr Ward was also taken to the letter from Tress Cocks and
Maddox, solicitors for Wards, to Mr Crangle at Civil and Civic
of 21 June 1995
wherein on page 4 Wards' solicitors had said:
<P>

<i>`Our client, that is Wards, did not review the documents executed in May
1994 until some time in or about November 1994 when it was
first brought to our
client's attention by Civil and Civic that the May 1994 documents contained
provisions which were not included
in the material on which our client based
its TGMP proposal.'</i>
<P>

272   	Mr Ward accepted that it was he who gave Tress Cocks and
Maddox the instructions set out in their letter.  In so far as the
letter had
stated that Wards did not review the documents executed in May until some time
in November 1994, Mr Ward's evidence was
that the letter was incorrect and that
he had in fact not become aware until the following year that there was any
problems with
the contract.  In fact he had not reviewed the contract in
November but had discovered that something was wrong in November.  Civil
and
Civic had not brought the matter to his attention until early 1995, which
followed two meetings which he had with Mr Crangle
in November.  [T92-94]
<P>

273   	It was suggested to Mr Ward that his solicitor had
accurately transcribed the instructions he had been given but Mr Ward
did not
accept this to have been the case.  This is a situation in which, to my mind,
the contemporaneous record is to be accepted
as comprising the instructions
given to Mr Ward's solicitors.  I accept, however, that to Mr Ward's present
belief, the evidence
he gave in the witness box was his present best
recollection.  It is simply not consistent with the contemporaneous letter.
<P>

274   	Mr Ward accepted that the whole point of the design
meetings was amongst other things, to look at the drawings which were
extant
from time to time and consider changes to them and that one would know from
time to time what the revisions were which issued
of those drawings.  He could
not argue the point put to him that `even a cursory review of the design
meetings shows you that every
single document in the May drawing list had been
sent to Wards in 1994'.  [T98]
<P>

275   	His evidence was :
<P>

<i>`Q.	You would agree . . . that no one at Wards who had any connection with
the administration of the contract and the construction,
there was no
possibility that any such person, as at May 1994, could have thought that the
August 1993 list [of drawing] was of any
continuing application?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It could have application.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	In what way?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	To the extent that it was used to formulate our price.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	But that price was, as at November 1993, a target guaranteed maximum
price?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Not a guaranteed maximum price on a final basis for inclusion in the
contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Correct.    . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Could you seriously suggest that Wards thought, as at May 1994, that what
they were agreeing to construct was the project as defined
by the list on page
153?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, I agree with that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Every single one of those documents was replaced before May?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Wards knew that what they had to build was what was on the drawings as at
May?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.'     </i>[T98-99]
<P>

276   	Mr Ward had not had any role at all in the process where
on 18 May the Subcontract was signed by Mr Cherrie on every page.
 He seemed to
recall that he knew that Mr Cherrie was going to sign the document but he could
not recall discussing anything about
that with any person [T103].
<P>

277   	Mr Ward accepted at transcript 103 that it was understood
by everyone at Wards that the process of agreeing a GMP was just
about to be
finalised by the signature of the contract [T103].
<P>

<b>Evidence of Mr G.F. Cherrie</b>
<P>

278   	Mr Cherrie had first been advised of the proposed
construction of the Water Filtration Plant at Prospect in February 1992.
 He
had attended a meeting at the offices of Civil and Civic on 11 March 1992 at
which representatives of Civil and Civic explained
the project and there was a
discussion in relation to the tendering process.
<P>

279   	Mr Cherrie deposed in paragraph 3 of his statement that
in late May 1993 he inspected the site together with representatives
of Civil
and Civic and had a conversation with Mr Robinson of Civil and Civic to the
following effect:
<P>

<i>`Mr Robinson:	Civil and Civic will give Wards a target guaranteed maximum
price or "TGMP".  Over a period of a couple of months, this
TGMP would be
firmed into a GMP and Wards would have the right to accept the TGMP or have it
revised or walk away from the agreement.
 Prior to confirming the GMP we would
work together over a period and you would be involved in assisting us in
improving the design.
 Any savings resulting from improvements will be to your
account.  If there are any minor increases in the scope, these will also
be to
your account.  If the designers have forgotten to include for something or have
simply failed to design an element you will
be paid a variation for any extra
work.  You will make a million dollars out of design development . . .  If any
of the contractors
do not agree with the GMP then the work will be put out to
tender for interested parties.  The process of finalising a GMP is to
be agreed
before any work commences on the site.'    </i>[Paragraph 3 statement of 13
August 1998]
<P>

280   	Mr Cherrie was shown the paragraph under the heading
`General' in the Scope of Work part of Exhibit J1.  It was suggested
to him
that this explained accurately what he understood of Wards' risk in respect of
design development in May 1993.  His answer
was that he believed that this
interpretation of the words written was different to his understanding as
explained by Mr Robinson
in May 1993, although this document predated that
conversation by almost a year.
<P>

281   	Mr Cherrie's evidence was that as at 23 June 1992, the
date of document J1, Mr Levido was an estimating manager - T127.
<P>

282   	It was suggested to Mr Cherrie that it was always clear
as far as he knew, to Wards, that this was going to be a lump sum
contract -
and at the time this suggestion was put to him, the annexures to document J1
was shown to him.  He disagreed with this.
 His evidence was that as at June
1992 this may have been the intent but subsequent to this he had discussions
with representatives
of Civil and Civic `that changed the intent of the June
1992 document'.  [T127]
<P>

283   	Mr Cherrie had not seen document J1 in 1992.  
<P>

284   	In 1992 and by 1993 when Mr Cherrie had his first
involvement with the project he accepted that he was by then, reasonably
familiar with Civil and Civic's standard form blank contract.
<P>

285   	His familiarity with that standard term Subcontract
extended, he accepted, to a knowledge that it provided in clause 6.10
for the
submissions of variation claims.  [T128]
<P>

286   	In relation to document J2, Mr Cherrie accepted that he
had not been involved in the formulation of what was to be incorporated
next to
the heading `Design Contingency' towards the end of page 1 of the letter.  Nor
was he involved with the discussions referred
to on the second page of document
J2.  [T129]
<P>

287   	Mr Cherrie was asked a question in relation to the words
`risk assessment particularly with respect to design' on page 2
of document J2,
as compared to the Scope of Work forming part of J1 and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Can I suggest to you though that it is quite plain, when one looks at
the scope of work which I took you to and this document
together, that the risk
assessment particularly with respect to design, is referring to what was under
the heading "General" in the
scope of works . . .</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes. . . .'   </i>[T129]
<P>

288   	Mr Cherrie, in relation to document J3, had not, he said
seen it during 1992.  He accepted that the `Scope of Work' referred
to on the
second page of document J2 of 7 July 1992 was in different terms to the Scope
of Work forming part of document J1.  He
was then asked in relation to the
Scope of Work on page 2 of document J3:
<P>

<i>`Q.	It is clear, is it not, from the form of this document and the content
of it that this is not meant as a replacement scope of
work, it is meant as a
clarification of what has been discussed and agreed about the formal scope of
work I showed you earlier?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I believe so . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you will see at the end of the document, page 126, a list of the
drawings upon which the lump sum price is based?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, I can see that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Even though you were not involved in 1992, by 1993 when you did become
involved it was clear that that list of drawings had already
been
superseded?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I believe so.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And it continued to be developed and changed right up until the Contract
was signed?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So that when one comes to look at the list of documents constituting the
drawings in the contract of 18 May, it is not this list
of course?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It is certainly not that list.'   [T130-131.</i>
<P>

289   	In relation to page 3 of document J3, namely the
paragraph which commences `we have allowed specific contingencies . . .'.
 Mr
Cherrie was asked:
<P>

<i>`Q.	There is no doubt though, is there, looking at the document that the
concept of design development was one which the parties were
talking of at the
time?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Referring to the document, I believe so.'  [This document being the 7
July 1992 letter].  [T131]</i>
<P>

290   	Mr Cherrie accepted at transcript 132, that by the time
he became involved in the contract, the concept of design development
was still
one which was being discussed between the parties and that this was `in the
context of who was to bear the risk of that'.
 [T132]
<P>

291   	Mr Cherrie was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And can I suggest to you that from the earliest days of your involvement
in this contract, it was </i><cite>always quite clear that there was going to
be room for argument between the parties about whether particular change was
one which
should result in a variation claim or whether it was one covered by
the concept of design and development risk</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes I agree with that</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And that, at the end of the day, was a considerable source of tension
between the parties?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, it was.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	But there was no doubt that there was those two competing
concepts?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, there was . . .'</i>.  [T132]
<P>

292   	Mr Cherrie's evidence was that he had a very limited
involvement in the project by August 1993 which did not extend to involving
himself in changes of the detail of the proposed contractual terms or anything
like that at that stage.'  [T132-133]
<P>

293   	Mr Cherrie had no recollection of the letter document J6,
being copied to him.
<P>

294   	Mr Cherrie had not ever had any involvement with the
concept of target guaranteed maximum prices moving to guaranteed maximum
prices
before it was mentioned to him in connection with this contract and as far as
he was concerned, this was then a novel contractual
development.  [T133]
<P>

295   	Mr Cherrie was asked:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And I take it in those circumstances, that you were careful to make sure
you understood the mechanics of what was involved in
that process?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Given that it was the first time it had been explained to me, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Is it your recollection that the first you'd heard of this was in a
conversation rather than a document?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	The first I heard of it was definitely in a conversation . . .'.
</i>[T133]
<P>

296   	Mr Cherrie could not recall when it was that he first saw
the letter of 3 August 1996, document J6.
<P>

297   	Mr Cherrie was asked in relation to the first page of
document J6:
<P>

<i>`Q.	So it was clear, was it not, to the officer who was dealing with this,
that what was being asked was not for the finalisation
of a lump sum with which
Wards would be happy but the finalisation of the preliminary matters, the
target guaranteed maximum price?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, it was.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And again from your observation, although it might have been a bit
elevated at this point, given your role in the company and lack
of detailed
involvement, it was quite clear, was it not, that this process was
</i><cite>leading up only and no more than to the agreement with the
TGMP</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Once the TGMP was agreed between the parties, there was no guarantee that
Wards would end up with the Contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>And Wards did not think that the agreement of a TGMP
constituted a contract for the construction of anything</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>In my capacity, in my role, yes I agree with that.  Other
people may have had different views</cite><i> . . .'.  </i>[T134]
<P>

298   	It was quite clear to Mr Cherrie from the third and
fourth sentences of paragraph 1 of document J6, that the final works
might vary
from the scope of works referred to in the annexures.  It was also, Mr Cherrie
accepted, completely clear that the final
works might not include some of the
things in the scope of works.  [T135]
<P>

299   	Mr Cherrie accepted that he certainly knew that over time
there were considerable elements of the project which were in fact
deleted from
the scope, particularly concerning some structures.
<P>

300   	Mr Cherrie was asked in relation to paragraph 2 of
document J6:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Do you agree with me, what Wards was asked to do when formulating its
TGMP proposal was, amongst other things, to include anticipated
savings that
Wards believed could be achieved through its participation in Design
Development?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I understand that it what we were being asked to do . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You personally were not involved in the detailed formulation of the
TGMP?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No I was not.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Who was?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Adrian Levido and Mike Manion.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You see, in the last sentence of paragraph 2 [of J6] that the TGMP
proposal was to outline the nature of any design issues that
Wards might wish
to explore during design development?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I can see that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It was quite clear from the start, was it not, that there were a number
of phases of design development that were going to be relevant
to this project.
Can I suggest to you before you answer that, that those phases were the phases
which led up to the submission of
a TGMP and the phase between TGMP and GMP and
indeed, at the end of the day, there was also design development which was
going to
happen after contract.  Do you agree with that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No I don't agree with that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And in what way do you not agree with this?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I can only disagree with it on the basis that I had always been told that
design development after agreement of GMP would be minimal
on the basis that
the design would be </i><cite>virtually</cite><i> complete from the time we
agree on GMP.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Your disagreement was as to size of design development, rather than
concept?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I apologise, yes you are right.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So it is quite clear to you, even using hindsight and looking at the
documents, that there was going to be three phases where design
development
might impact.  The first is up to TGMP, the second is to TGMP and the third is
contract onwards.  You're only point,
I take it, is it was your apprehension
and you say because of what you had been told it was certainly your
understanding that that
third phase would be minor?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>'   [T136]
<P>

301   	In relation to paragraph 5 of the letter J6, Mr Cherrie
was asked as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	The next thing that is said by the document is this is a suggestion from
Civil and Civic, you see that the part of the arrangement
between the parties
was going to be that if Wards added a benefit by way of design development,
Wards would get the advantage?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I can see that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	But if C&amp;C added the benefit, it would get the advantage?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, I can see that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	By the time you became involved in the project to the extent you did in
May 1993, did you understand that as part of the proposed
arrangement between
the parties?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	At no time did I ever understand any form of arrangement that C&amp;C
were getting the benefit.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Did this not get discussed with you at the time?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	This 3 August letter did not get discussed with me at the time.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You would agree, wouldn't you, that it is absolutely plain from the terms
of that document that that is what C&amp;C was proposing?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, I agree . .  .'.  </i>[T137]
<P>

302   	Mr Cherrie accepted that it was always clear, right up to
the time when the contract was signed, that there may or may not
be a contract
ultimately entered into.  Mr Cherrie was asked in relation to paragraph 6 of
document J6:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And what is made clear by this paragraph is, if there is a contract
entered into, that this will speak from the time of contract,
any risk
associated with further design development is to be borne by Wards unless there
is a major change to scope required by the
client where additional funds are
made available to C&amp;C?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I can see what that letter says.  The only thing I can add, referring to
my discussion with Greg Robinson in May 1993, I was always
told that if the
designers had simply forgotten to design something or had left something out,
we would be paid a variation.'</i>
<P>

303   	Mr Cherrie, of course, accepted that the letter J6
post-dated the conversation which he stated had occurred with Mr Robinson.
<P>

304   	Mr Cherrie was asked and answered as follows, in relation
to the terms of the letter J6:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And you would agree with me that a number of things are  very clear from
the terms of this letter.  Firstly, that there may or
may not be a
contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Secondly, that if there was going to be a contract, it was subject to a
condition that further design development after contract
time was a risk borne
by Wards?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	With an exception that if there was a major change to scope required by
the client for which C&amp;C got money, then there might
be an ability in Wards
to be paid?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, I can see.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You would agree that that is a very clear stipulation by Civil and
Civic?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The exception is usually understood, isn't it.  The reference to `client'
is not a reference to Civil and Civic, it is a reference
to the Head Client, if
we can call it that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Most certainly.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And if the Head Client does not suggest a claim which results in money
going to Civil and Civic, Wards are stuck with a design
development
risk.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That may well be the case.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Was that made clear to you by the persons who were in control of the day
to day contractual negotiations on behalf of Wards?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Between the period of 3 August and . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	For instance, November that year?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I certainly developed more of a role between August and November.  At
what point in time I became aware of anything to do with
this letter, I don't
know.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It does not take any great wit, does it . . . to understand what I am
putting to you about that paragraph, from this letter.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I agree with you.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It is not expressed in any way obscurely?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You know that one of the issues in this case is whether or not there is,
as part of a contractual relationship between C&amp;C
and Wards, the ability on
behalf of C&amp;C to make Wards responsible for the cost of design development.
I am expressing it in general
terms?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, I believe so.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And that issue is characterised by a dispute as to whether Wards were
aware of the terms in clause 6.30 in the contract you eventually
signed?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes . . ..</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	. . . . You know enough about that contract of 18 May 1994, don't you, to
know that in clauses 6.10 and 6.30 it establishes the
rules by which the
competition between variations and design development will be played?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I now understand that to be the case.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Can I suggest to you that a central feature of those rules is that if
something is design and development, Wards is responsible.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Within the defined scope, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Now, whatever that means, the risk that Wards had in respect of further
design development is quite plain from the terms of this
letter, isn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Design development, unless major changes to scope, so design development
for the scope is what I understand that to be.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Can I make it quite clear to you, this is a contractual provision which
is meant to speak from the time when the contract is signed
isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	. . . Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And it is plainly in those circumstances, something which is referable to
whatever the scope is at that time, otherwise it wouldn't
make mention?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes I can understand that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q	You agree with me, do you not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes I agree.</i>
<P>

<i>His Honour:  When you say "this", you are referring to paragraph 6, are you
;Mr Finch?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.   . . .</i>'  [T139-140]
<P>

305   	Mr Cherrie further agreed as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	So that reading paragraph 6 according to the tenor of its own words, it
makes Wards responsible for further design risk after
contract, unless there is
a major change to the scope which is relevant as at 18 May 1994?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, I agree.  Subject, as I've earlier said, to the magnitude.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Now, the magnitude point that you have does not appear in this
letter?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No it does not.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And can I suggest to you that you are not able to point to any document
or record of any sort which introduces that qualification
to this term in
paragraph 6?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, that is probably the case . . . ` </i> [T140]
<P>

306   	Mr Cherrie was asked in relation to the document J6 and
the section under the heading `General' appearing at PX volume 3
page 149, the
following:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Turning back to page 148, I want to draw your attention to the fact that
the same risk on design development sentence that appears
first in June 1992
and again in the letter of 3 August 1993 appeared in the scope of work itself
at page 148.  There are some wording
changes but it is essentially the same,
isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, I can see that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You will see that the jargon `TGMP' has been introduced into this but
apart from that, it appears to be the same?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It appears to be the same, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So again, anyone looking at this on behalf of Wards could be in no doubt
that the risk design development after contract would
be Wards.  I always leave
out the exception which we can take as read from now on?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	As at that point in time, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You will see, if it wasn't already clear, that the additional information
to be supplied included in the fourth dot point on that
same standard, Civil
and Civic Pty Limited subcontract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you will see before I get to that, turning through the document at
page 153, the updated version of the relevant drawing numbers?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, I can see that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	At page 153 you will see a list of drawing numbers and I don't want to
drag you through it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I can see that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You will see it has `updated until now all the drawings except where
stated', a revision there at the top of the page?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, I can see that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The importance of that, I suggest, was it was part of the process between
the parties as reflected in this document, that the drawings
were not a static
concept, they were changing all the time, they were being updated and
revised?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	As at this point in time, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That process continued to happen throughout 1993?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I believe so.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>And it continued to happen all the way up to and indeed in some
cases past 18 May 1994</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>To a great deal past 1994</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You are agreeing with me?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I agree with you.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Nobody at Wards thought that what they were agreeing to construct was
something described by a list of documents as at November
1993?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	November or July.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	We have only reached August so far but I put to you there was a
continuing development of drawings to May?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Right.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	No one at Wards thought what they were agreeing to construct was a
project defined by a set of drawings in August 1993 or November
1993?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	There was certainly understanding that the design was being
developed.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And Wards' obligation was to construct whatever the drawings said at the
relevant time?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is certainly not my understanding.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Well, can I put it to you this way, perhaps the question was inadequately
lengthy.  Wards had to build what the drawings said and
Wards had the ability
to either say, this change in a drawing gives us a right to claim a variation
or it might be subject to an
agreement from Civil and Civic that it was a
design development covered by Wards' risk.  Whichever way that argument turned
out affected
the dollars but the activities on site had to be those that were
on the drawings.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.  Given that, I agree with you. . .  </i>`   [T142-143]
<P>

307   	Mr Cherrie's day to day involvement with the project
covered liaising with Wards' senior people, being Mike Manion and Adrian
Levido
to some degree and Peter Low when he was appointed to take over in January
1994.  Mr Cherrie certainly discussed matters to
do with the project with those
persons and had various discussions with representatives of Civil and Civic and
attended meetings.
 [T145]
<P>

308   	Mr Cherrie accepted that he was involved between August
1993 and May 1994 in the working out of the contractual detail contained
in the
correspondence between the parties.  [T145]  He had attended nine meetings to
the best of his recollection.
<P>

309   	Mr Cherrie accepted that the work `variations' as used in
the third paragraph of the 23 August 1993 letter, J7, was a somewhat
inaccurate
use of the word.  He accepted that what Mr Levido meant was that there had been
changes which were summarised at PX volume
3 page 366 and that the changes were
the subject of a pricing change in the TGMP as set out in that Table.
<P>

310   	Mr Cherrie accepted that what was happening at this time
was that there were design developments and some other changes happening
which
were being reflected from time to time in changes in what Wards thought might
be its TGMP.  [T147]  Mr Cherrie accepted that
what Wards did was to prepare
its TGMPs, there having been a number of them as one moved on in time,
according to what the scope
looked like at the relevant time.  [T147]  Mr
Cherrie accepted that the scope changed as the months went on.  Both design and
scope
were changing.  He was asked:
<P>

<i>`Q.	That scope changed as the month went on?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>The scope changed yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Reflective in </i><cite>some cases of the scope changing</cite><i>, the
designs which underlay that scope were changing over time?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, the design and </i><cite>the scope were changing</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	In some, but not all cases, the specification was changing?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I'm not aware of that, but can only assume that that would only be the
case.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Would you agree that that is not quite so relevant because it is speaking
at a level of generality which isn't as important for
pricing as the drawings
and the scope?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, I agree with that.</i>'  [T147]
<P>

311   	Mr Cherrie accepted that Wards by the letter of 23 August
1993, document J3, prepared in addition to the consolidation, a
list of
potential areas where they considered savings might be made during the design
development phase.
<P>

312   	Mr Cherrie accepted that what Wards were saying in the
second sentence of the fourth paragraph of document J7, was that these
were
matters which Wards thought could be saved by way of design development.
<P>

313   	In relation to the proposed contract conditions, part of
document J7, Mr Cherrie's evidence was that the persons who are
involved in the
formulation of those conditions were Mr Levido and Mr Manion and that they had
authority to bind Wards to contract
conditions but only for the items as
detailed on page 375 of PX volume 3.  [T148]
<P>

314   	Mr Cherrie's evidence was that the five items which
appear on page 375 of PX volume 3, part of J7, might not have been specifically
discussed with him at that point in time but were five standard conditions
which Wards put in all of their contracts or tried to
put in all of their
contracts.  He did, however, accept on being tested, that the proposed
condition under the heading `Variations'
could not be a standard condition and
was not something he had seen before and was not the product of the
understanding of Mr Levido
and Mr Manion of a policy of Mr Ward which applied
to all contracts.  [T148]
<P>

315   	Mr Cherrie's evidence was that the proposed contract
condition headed `Variations' was not `run by [him] at the time'.  [T149]
<P>

316   	Mr Cherrie accepted that it was quite clear that what
Wards was asking for in this document was for contractual terms to
go into the
contract to speak from the time of that Contract.  He gave evidence that he was
not aware of Civil and Civic ever agreeing
to the Wards' suggested terms.
[T150-151]
<P>

317   	Mr Cherrie's attention was directed to the sentence in
the Wards' proposed Contract Conditions reading: `This would apply
to all
savings in excess of those nominated in this submission which have been offered
on a shared savings basis of fifty percent'.
 
<P>

<i>`Q.	Do you see that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I can see that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That is also different to the 3 August suggestion?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It is.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And significantly different, isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Because if one looks at the document at page 381, one sees the start of
quite a long list of suggested potential savings with some
quite large dollars
appended to them?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes I can see that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Depending on who suggested these changes, this could involve C&amp;C
giving away reasonably large amounts of money?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	How was this tension between 23 August and 3 August resolved?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I was not involved in any discussions of any 50/50 80% sharing or
whatever, so I cannot comment.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>It would have had to have been resolved of course, wouldn't
it?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes, I believe so</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	If anything was clear, this was clear;  that those at Wards who were
doing the ground work on these contractual conditions, would
have to expect
something more to happen after this letter by way of resolution of this
tension?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I don't agree that there was a tension at this point in time.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The writer of the letter couldn't have gone home and watched the footy
secure in the knowledge that C&amp;C had agreed to this
could he?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I'm not aware what discussions took place regarding this.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You will see that what the writer does is require these as
conditions?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You see that they are different to what C&amp;C had said?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Until he was satisfied that there had been some resolution of that
difference, he couldn't be satisfied that what he had required
had been
agreed?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	All I can say is Civil and Civic may have accepted those without further
discussion.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Or they may not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	They may not have, I agree.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>One has to look forward to the formal contract to see, doesn't
one</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Possibly, yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The subcontract which is in blank still at this stage, wasn't ever
changed from August to November to put any of these in, was
it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, it was not.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Why not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I can't answer that.  I do not know.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Can I suggest to you that the reason is that on 17 November both parties
were well aware that there was to come into existence
a formal contract which
would be the document which pulled all these strands together?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I believe so yes.'  </i>[T152-153]
<P>

318   	At transcript 154, it was suggested in cross-examination
to Mr Cherrie that:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Whatever the Contract conditions say at page 375, paragraph 6 on page
131, which is the second paragraph on that page, continued
to represent your
understanding up to and including May 1994 of the exposure of Wards to design
development risk?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, I believe that to be the case.'  </i>[T154]
<P>

<b>Evidence of other witnesses</b>
<P>

319   	Evidence was also adduced from a number of other
witnesses being principally Messrs Levido, Pittolo and Niederberger of Wards
and Messrs Robinson and O'Connell of Civil and Civic all of whom were cross
examined.  As earlier indicated, evidence may be conveniently
referred to
fairly shortly and in relation to particular topics.
<P>

<b>Mr Levido</b>
<P>

320   	As at June 1992, Mr Levido was the `estimating manager'
at Wards and his duties in relation to this, as other projects, was
to review
and prepare tenders for Wards.  He also had responsibility to suggest and
consider alterations to the terms of the contractual
relationship between the
parties.
<P>

321   	The letter J1, had of course, been addressed to him and
it was his letter of 25 June 1992 which responded, J2.  J3 was also
his letter
of 7 July 1992 and Civil and Civic's letter of 16 July 1992, J4, was marked to
his attention.  J5 was marked to his attention
and he wrote J5A.  The critical
letter of 3 August 1993, J6, was marked to his attention and it was his letter
of 23 August 1993,
J7, which responded, suggesting contract conditions.  Mr
Levido also wrote the letter of 20 September 1993, J7A, and he attended
the 22
October 1993 meeting already referred to.
<P>

322   	Mr Levido had attended a number of meetings and
discussions of a technical nature between mid-July1992 and May 1993.  His
recollection was of a conversation at a site inspection on 5 May 1993 meeting,
where Mr Robinson had indicated a general intention
to seek from those parties
who had worked successfully with Civil and Civic through the confidentiality
period, contracts generally
in accordance with works they had priced.  During
the relevant period, Civil and Civic would work with those parties and a `full
design team' with the intention of minimising and if possible, eliminating any
concerns contractors might have with signing a contract
for the nominated
sum.
<P>

323   	At some stage in around mid-August 1993, Mr Levido asked
Mr Robinson whether Mr Robinson would be running the works at Prospect
and Mr
Robinson had answered in the affirmative.
<P>

324   	Mr Levido, as appears below in the Judgment, was closely
cross-examined on many of the J documents.  By August 1993, he was
aware of the
possible tension between the concepts of what would constitute a variation and
what would constitute a design development.
 Mr Levido left the project in
November 1993.
<P>

325   	Mr Levido was asked:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Was there somebody who, as it were, stepped into your shoes when you
moved on to do other things in November?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Because of the structure we had put together for this estimate,
no.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So who was it, so far as you were concerned, the day you left, who was
going to be looking at the contractual conditions in the
upcoming
contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Mike Manion and Glenn Cherrie.   . . .' </i> [T237]
<P>

<b>Mr Pittolo</b>
<P>

326   	Mr Pittolo commenced work on the site in January 1994,
having had no significant involvement with the site or any documents
touching
the project before that.  In about December, Mr Cherrie informed him that he
was to be the contract manager, however, he
did not then look at correspondence
between the parties.
<P>

327   	Through conversations with Mr Cherrie and Mr Manion, he
became aware that the process of negotiating with the TGMP had been
settled.
<P>

328   	As to the 32 design meetings held between 5 November 1993
and 18 May 1994, as far as he could recall, they were all attended
by either
himself or someone else from Wards.
<P>

329   	He accepted that it was fair to say that he was concerned
more with how to build the project than the contractual relationship
between
the parties [T265].
<P>

330   	As has already been mentioned, Mr Manion prior to his
leaving the site, prepared a document for Mr Pittolo which brought
to Mr
Pittolo's attention, a number of the contract conditions.
<P>

331   	In Mr Pittolo's opinion, a GMP was in a sense synonymous
with signing the lump sum contract [T282].
<P>

332   	Mr Pittolo's evidence was that it was not considered
necessary to look at the 7 February Early Works Contract although, at
7
February, he believed there were issues still unresolved apropos the fate of
the various contractual exchanges that had occurred
between August to November.
[T283]  He was asked:
<P>

<i>`Q.	In the document that you have referred to today which was prepared by Mr
Manion and shown to you, do you recall where in time
that document came to your
notice, that's before or after the 7th February contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	After the 7 February contract.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>So that it was plain to you after 7 February that there were
still matters yet to be resolved to be incorporated into the final
Subcontract</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>In the final contract yes.</cite>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Did not that spur you into looking at what the 7 February
contract said about those matters</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>No</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Why not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	At this stage </i><cite>I can't honestly say</cite><i>.  I was
concentrating with getting works done on site.  I was concentrating on getting
the site construction works done.'   </i>[T283]
<P>

333   	In being asked who reviewed the documentation of the 7
February contract to make certain that Wards understood what it was
agreeing to
be paid for what works, Mr Pittolo's answer was `to my knowledge nobody';
adding that this was because `we just saw that
contract as a method to be paid
for what we were doing at the time'.  [T284]
<P>

334   	The curious approach by Wards is clearly reflected in Mr
Pittolo's answers at page 284 of the transcript:
<P>

<i>`Q.	. . . The works covered by the 7 February contract are not precisely the
same as the works that are set out in the 6 December
letter or the purchase
order.  That's right isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's right.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That means that one has to look at the works described in the 7 February
contract to see what the 7 February contract covers?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	One cannot tell that from looking anywhere else?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Wasn't it important that Wards do that exercise?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, we did not believe it was.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	How did Wards know what was covered by the 7 February contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	We believed that the 7 February contract was just a mechanism for getting
paid for the works we were doing and all the works that
were in the 7 February
contract were part of the TGMP-D Schedule.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	How would you know that without looking at it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I don't know . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Who was doing the work of looking at the intention of the 7
February contract</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Nobody</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That could have been done, of course, couldn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, it could have been.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Anybody from Wards could at any time have looked at the 7 February
contract as long as they liked?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Whose job within Wards was it to look at contracts and see what they
said?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	The project managers.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Who were they at the time of 7 February?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>That was me</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Did anyone else have that responsibility?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	A couple of other people could have, but at the end, I had the
responsibility.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You were content to leave any consideration of what was in the contract
to the final contract on the understanding, true as it
turned out, that the
work in the 7 February contract was covered by the final contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And as it turned out, the work covered by the 7 February contract was
covered by the final contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Nevertheless it was important when that final Subcontract came
around to look at what was comprehended in it</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>And who did that</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>The 18 May contract</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Nobody looked at it before it was signed</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>This time there was no comfort area, was there, of some
contract in the future that might be looked at one day?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>No</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	One thing though did not need to be looked at for the purposes of
understanding what was happening, and that was whatever clause
said Wards bears
design risk for design development up to contract because you knew that
perfectly well for a month before?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	We knew that and we accepted that we bore that risk, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Mr Manion left the project in early March 1994 I
think?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Who at Wards in effect stepped into his shoes?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Nobody stepped directly into his shoes, his duties were resigned and the
project was restructured.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You recall that he was the one who wrote the letters back in August and
September which had suggested certain changes?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you will recall he was the one who had supplied you with the document
in February or so which set out certain matters which
were yet to be agreed
finally?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Who was it who stepped into the shoes of administering those
matters of outstanding agreement?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>I took on those duties</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>When he left, what steps did you take to familiarise yourself
as to the state of agreement between the parties that Mr Manion
identified?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>That was the reason I believe that Mike Manion prepared that
document for me</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>I'm asking what steps you took to make sure the matters were
resolved?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>I took no direct steps</cite><i>.  I presumed they would be
resolved in due course.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	By whom?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	With discussions between Wards and Civil and Civic.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Those were discussions that had to happen after that time?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And those are discussions which continued from February all the way up to
May?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	There were some discussions between February and May, yes, very
limited.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You were happy that by 18 May there were no remaining matters to be
discussed?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, I wasn't</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Wasn't it important then to let Mr Cherrie know that he
shouldn't sign the contract because you were not happy that certain matters
had
been agreed</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>It should have been I guess, yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>You didn't tell anyone before or after 18 May you had a belief
that some matters had not been agreed?</cite>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>I didn't until after May until February or March of
1995</cite><i> . . .'</i>  [T285-287]
<P>

335   	Mr Pittolo had difficulty in answering a number of
questions.  He was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	I'm asking you whether you told anyone that as of 18 May you thought
that there were matters yet to be agreed?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It did not occur to me on 18 May that there were matters unagreed.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It follows from that, that matters to which you refer, must have been
relatively unimportant?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, it does not necessarily follow.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Can you give an explanation as to why it is that there might have been an
important matter not agreed to your knowledge that was
not the subject to any
warning by you to anyone when the subcontract was signed? . . .If there was an
important matter that you knew
had not been agreed why did you not warn anyone
at 18 May that it had not been agreed?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Because at 18 May it was not of my - it wasn't brought to my attention
that certain matters were not agreed.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	But you are the person who is administering that at Wards are you
not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Who was going to bring it to your attention given that you were the
person administering that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I expected Civil and Civic to bring to my attention matters that were
unrecovered. [sic]</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	How would they know if you did not tell them, what you had not agreed to,
if you did not tell them?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It was not only what I agreed to.  It was what had not agreed to.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You already told us that Mr Manion prepared for you a document, things
that were yet to be agreed?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes. </i>
<P>

<i>Q.	I assume that what had not been agreed by 18 May was one of those
population of matters in that document or more of them?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, there were other matters outside that which had not been agreed as
well.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you knew that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I am aware of it now, I was not aware of it at the time.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Can I suggest to you that the whole purpose of Mr Manion
supplying you with this document was to inform you of the matters which at
that
time had not been agreed</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Are you saying that you did not pass that on to anyone
else</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>No, I didn't</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Wasn't it important to let someone else know that there were matters not
agreed?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	There were matters - the majority of those matters in there I believed
other people knew about.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Who?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Glenn Cherrie and Tony.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	How would they find out?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	They know prior to Mike Manion preparing that document that matters were
unresolved.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	How did they know that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Because of discussions with Mike Manion.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	If they do not give evidence of matters being unresolved before 18 May
can you explain that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No I can't</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>What did you do with the document prepared by Mr Manion listing
the matters not yet agreed</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>I put it in my filing cabinet I had at work </cite><i>. .
.'</i>  [T288-289]
<P>

336   	Mr Pittolo accepted that he had a recollection of the
event in 1994 when Mr O'Connell had given him a scope of works [T326].
 He
could not recall what Mr O'Connell said to him at the time the further scope of
works was handed over [T326].
<P>

337   	Mr Pittolo was asked to look at the 12 April 1994 scope
of works incorporated into the 18 May contract and whether he denied
that this
was the document that Mr O'Connell had given him.  His answer was:  `I've got
no recollection.  I can't say whether it
is or it didn't [sic].' [T327].
<P>

338   	Mr Pittolo was asked:
<P>

<i>`Q.	It was something headed "Scope of Works"?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It had a title on it `Scope of Works", yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So that when you got it you knew that it was a scope of works?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Can I suggest to you that as soon as you got it, it was
immediately apparent that it was different to the thing which is
TGMP/D</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>It was a different document, yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And the only prudent thing that you could have done, can I suggest to
you, was to read it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I've got no recollection of reading that document that . . . O'Connell
gave me.'   </i>[T327]
<P>

339   	Mr Pittolo was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Whenever Mr O'Connell gave you his scope of works it was clear that much
water had passed under the bridge since 3 August, wasn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	There had been a lot of discussion since then.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	For instance, </i><cite>some major areas of the scope had been
deleted</cite><i>, had they not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.   . . .</i>[T328]
<P>

340   	It was put to Mr Pittolo at transcript 329 that the scope
of works document which he had seen prior to Mr O'Connell handing
him a scope
of works in 1994 was the 3 August scope and he accepted this.  He accepted also
that he had seen no other scope of any
sort between those two occasions which
covered the whole of the works and he further accepted that between those
dates, <u>substantial changes</u> had happened to the project by way of
deletion of significant items of construction and <u>by way of design
change</u> [T329].
<P>

341   	Mr Pittolo was asked:
<P>

<i>`Q.	</i><cite>It was obvious, was it not, that by the time Mr O'Connell
handed you a scope of works, that it had to be different to the 3 August
scope
of works</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes, to the 3 August one</cite><i>.'   </i>[T329]
<P>

342   	Mr Pittolo at transcript 332 was asked:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And assuming that what you were given in 1994 was an update of that
document, it was obvious wasn't it, that it was going to be
different to
August?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	You're assuming that it was going to be an update of this document,
yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you're not suggesting are you that what Mr O'Connell gave you in 1994
was another copy of these scopes of work, are you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I don't know what he gave me in 1994.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Well just recalling your evidence that by 1994 significant parts of the
work had disappeared, such as the structures . . . There
would have been no
point at all in Mr O'Connell giving you another one of these August documents,
would there?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>By 1994, these three scopes of work - and you will see there
are three - had been superseded</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It was obvious when you got the document in 1994, that whatever else it
contained, it had to contain those changes to the project
which had occurred up
to that point . . .?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	You would assume that it would contain those changes, yes.'</i>
[T332]
<P>

343   	At transcript 333, Mr Pittolo was asked:
<P>

<i>`Q.	</i><cite>The reason you didn't look at the scope of works</cite><i>
given to you by Mr O'Connell was that as a person concerned with day to day
construction, that new scope of works was unlikely to
tell you anything you
needed to know?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>I've got no idea why I didn't look at that
document</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Did you give it to anybody?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I've got no recollection of giving it to anybody.'</i>
<P>

344   	Mr Pittolo at transcript 335, accepted that it was
obvious that the scope of works which had been part of the original tender
documents on 3 August, were something that would need to change as time went
on.
<P>

345   	In relation to the concept of design development risk, Mr
Pittolo was asked what he expected the document given to him by
Mr O'Connell to
say about that in 1994 and his answer was `I didn't know what to expect at that
time in that document . . .'.  [T335]
<P>

346   	On the same page, Mr Pittolo gave evidence that he was
having trouble answering questions relating to the document which
Mr O'Connell
gave him because it was so long ago and `I don't recall what I expected to be
in that document.  I don't recall how
I reacted to the document as as I've
said, I don't know what I've done with the document.  I'm having a lot of
trouble answering
questions relating to that document . . .
<P>

<i>`Q.	. . . Is not the difficulty that you are having in dealing with this
document given to you by Mr O'Connell, that as you sit in
the box and cast your
mind back over your conduct, you now realise that </i><cite>you should have
appreciated as soon as you got it, that it was important to look at
it</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>That is the problem I'm having.  And I can't tell you why I
didn't look at it and I can't tell you what I did with it</cite><i>.'</i>
[T335-336]
<P>

347   	Mr Pittolo also at transcript 336, gave the following
evidence:
<P>

<i>`Q.	. . . Can I suggest to you, what was clear to you when you eventually
did come to look at the scope of works - which is incorporated
into the 18 May
contract - and that is, that there were no surprises to you at least in the
description of design development risk,
and the allocation of that risk to
Wards, given the previous documentation which we've taken you through?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	If you refer to those first two paragraphs, depending on your definition
of design development, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you appreciate what I'm putting that to you, I'm not trying to bind
you to any particular definition of what design development
is, but in a
nutshell, this is the same story you had been familiar with since the first
time you came onto the project and looked
at the documents in different
words?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It still, as far as you knew, allowed you to argue that in a particular
instance a design change was something you ought to get
paid for as a
variation, for instance?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	If it wasn't under the definition of design development, yes, we would
have been entitled to a variation . . .'   </i>[T336-337]
<P>

<b>Mr Niederberger</b>
<P>

348   	Mr Niederberger first became involved in the project in
about September 1993 at an engineering meeting held on that date.
 Prior to
attending that meeting, Mr Niederberger had not reviewed any documents at all
to familiarise himself with the project.
 Thereafter, he read the invitation to
tender, the contract document which was included with that and briefly reviewed
some of the
estimate files that had been put together.  [T368]  However, it was
not Mr Niederberger's job to track through the correspondence
from 3 August and
following.  [T390]
<P>

349   	To his recollection, after Mr Manion left, the person at
Wards who was in control of the estimate and whose job it was at
Wards to make
sure that the right drawings were incorporated in the final contract was Mr Max
Pittolo.  [T381]
<P>

350   	Mr Niederberger was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	How was Wards keeping track of what the scope of works looked like, from
time to time?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	We kept copies of the minutes of meetings and we didn't change any
documents.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>It must have been then very clear to Wards that at some stage a
scope of works was going to issue which updated all of these items
like item
2.1</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>Yes I'd expect so</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And I suggest to you that you understood that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you understood that at some stage Civil and Civic would hand to you a
document bringing up to date the scope of works with
all of these items?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I guess it would have done, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And it would be important when they happen to look at it and see what was
on it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Because notwithstanding the fact that you were interested in the bill of
quantities from the point of view of the number, the scope
of works was an
important document?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.'   </i>[T394]
<P>

351   	Mr Niederberger was not, he said, involved very deeply
with discussion of the risk profile documents or their ramifications
and in his
view, the persons doing that work were Mr Levido and Mr Manion mostly at the
time.  [T402]
<P>

352   	Mr Niederberger's job description did not involve
consideration of the detail for example, in the 7 February contract because
by
that stage Wards were working and his responsibility was the works on site.
[T409]
<P>

353   	Mr Niederberger's responsibilities from about early
December on, were works oriented in the sense that he was mostly on site
concerned with construction matters and was not therefore concerned with
continuing discussions between the parties about what might
be in the contract.
[T409]
<P>

354   	Mr Niederberger had no involvement in the drafting or
review of any Subcontract offered to Hornicks although he had attended
design
meetings up until near the end of March.  [T409]
<P>

<b>Mr Robinson</b>
<P>

355   	During 1993, Mr Robinson was responsible as the person in
charge of negotiations with Wards and he accepted that he took
the primary
responsibility.  There were, however, a number of persons who he reported to.
To Mr Robinson's recollection, there was
no occasion or aspect of the
negotiations in 1993 where any of those persons to whom he reported expressed
disagreement with his
recommendation or decision.  He accepted that, to the
best of his knowledge and belief, records of his decision making in 1993 in
relation to the negotiations were the Civil and Civic position.  [T417]
<P>

356   	Mr Robinson gave evidence that during 1993, he did not at
any time set out to conceal from Wards, the Civil and Civic intention
as to the
terms upon which a subcontract might be entered with them.  There was no aspect
of the risk allocation or commercial terms
which was intended during 1993 to be
entered with Wards which he sought to misrepresent or in any way misstate.
<P>

357   	Mr Robinson was asked when it was in 1993 that there was,
what he described as `the final risk allocation'.  His answer was
`I believe
that we had the majority of them on the table in August of 93 and I believe
that they were covered through various meetings
that then took place up until
the agreement of a target guaranteed maximum price on 17 November'.  [T418]
<P>

358   	Mr Ward's recollection was that as at 17 November 1993,
the basis upon which Wards and Civil and Civic were going to proceed
forward to
a GMP is to be found in the record of their dealings culminating on 17 November
1993  [T420]
<P>

359   	Mr Robinson accepted that on 17 November 1993, reading
Wards' document as the culmination of a process which yielded final
risk
allocation, he knew and believed that Wards regarded design development as
something which might cost money and as something
which would be carried out
within the defined scope of works.  [T421]
<P>

360   	At transcript 421, Mr Robinson was asked and answered as
follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	As at that date, in what document or documents, if any, did you believe
the defined scope to be found?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I believed that the defined scope was outlined in the letter of offer
that was sent to Wards which responded in this acceptance.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Do you mean the 3 August 1993 letter?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Could you just reflect on that answer and tell the Court whether or not
you regard that as accurate?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, it was not accurate.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You yourself, today, have told his Honour, haven't you, that between the
3 August offer and the final allocation of risk culmination
of negotiations on
17 November, there had been some changes carried out by dealings between the
parties which are on record?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's correct, yes.'</i>
<P>

361   	Mr Robinson was closely examined on what document or
documents as at 17 November 1993, one required to look at, to find the
defined
scope.
<P>

362   	Mr Robinson's answer to the following questions was as
follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	What documents, if any, have you decided, apart from Wards' TGMP-D which
contained the defined scope as at 17 November 1993?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	The defined scope would be the original letter of offer which was sent by
Civil and Civic.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That was 3 November?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.  There were a series of meetings which were held between that date
and the TGMP, the acceptable TGMP, of 17 November.  There
were regular
Wards/Civils meetings, a couple that I have come across were number 4 and
number 5, 5 being on 23 September 1993.  There
were also exchanges with the
previous TGMP by Wards of their risk profile . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You referred to drawings being done during the August/November period
didn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Is this a correct description?  Drawings which were done during that
period did not themselves define scope but gave concrete form
to design within
scope, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	. . . No I don't believe so.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	What is wrong with it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It's what the definition of concrete scope is, concrete form.  Are you
referring to constructions which were concrete structures
which were
defined?</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Drawing is a two-dimensional depiction of something to be built, is that
right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Concept is an idea, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The scope of works, so-called as at 3 August 1993 described in various
ways using words something to be built, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Drawings have later been done including during the period of August and
November to depict what is to be built, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And his Honour will have come across the expression AFC drawings, meaning
"approved for construction", is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And his Honour will have come across cross-designations of drawing which
refer to revisions.  They refer to amendments and modifications
to drawings,
don't they?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	As the number gets bigger so the number of modifications or amendments
increase, is that correct?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	As at 17 November 1993 some drawings existed which had not existed on 3
August 1993, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	But the coming into existence of those drawings did not of itself alter
the scope of the works, did it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	They were drawings to give two-dimensional form, material plans, to the
work which had been described in the scope documents, is
that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The drawings were to give the plans for construction within the scope, is
that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Of course in theory at least, a drawing might depict work which falls
outside the defined scope, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	But according to the evidence you've given his Honour is it the case that
during the period up to 17 November 1993 you don't rely
upon any drawings
passing between you and Wards to define the scope?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The 3 August scope document was not the last word on the definition of
scope up to 17 November was it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You've referred to some meetings, including numbers 4 and 5 as containing
material which show evolution beyond 3 August in the
definition of scope
haven't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Not in the definition of scope, but in clarification of scope.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Should his Honour suppose there is a material difference in your mind
between clarification and definition of scope?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Definition of scope, I was using as a description of what the works were
that were contained in the TGMP.  Clarification of work
is actually taking
drawings and doing more work to them so that they are clearer in terms of the
design that is required to be completed
or constructed.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	When you say clearer, you are talking about the addition of more levels
of detail so as to bring drawings closer to AFC [Approved
For Construction]
scope, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The TGMP is a monetary sum isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And at all times during August to November 1993, culminating on 17
November, it was a sum dealt with between Civil and Civic and
Wards as an
aggregate of component sums is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And the TGMP-D document coming from Wards is a list of work items,
quantities, and extended prices to produce an aggregate price,
is that
right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Of course, for a lump sum contract, the allocation of sums within
individual components doesn't directly affect the decision whether
to award the
contract, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's right.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Again, variations depend on how the scope and the risks have been
allocated.'</i>   [T426]
<P>

363   	Mr Robinson accepted that the TGMP-D reflected the
current scope of works as at 17 November and in that regard it did something
which the 3 August scope document no longer did.  [T427]
<P>

364   	At transcript 431, Mr Robinson gave the following
evidence:
<P>

<i>`Q.	As at 17 November when the final allocation of risk took place, to your
belief Wards were proceeding on the basis that their TGMP
document defined the
scope of works, that's right, isn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	In terms of the work package breakdown, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	In terms of the work to be done, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The process which led up to the TGMP was something which was called
between Wards and Civil and Civic as a result of a network
agreement, is that
right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	What does "network" mean in that saying?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It meant people who were gathered together because of like
objectives.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	There was a group put together by earlier negotiations back in 1992 of
what might be called Civil and Civic as head contractor
hopefully and a number
of other companies, including Wards, as hopeful subcontractors, to produce a
competitive bid for the work,
is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A	Yes.   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So there was very explicitly from the middle of 1992 an atmosphere, which
you helped to create, of cooperation towards a common
end between Civil and
Civic and Wards for this project, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That came to be described that atmosphere as one of the hallmarks and
benefits of so-called partnering between these parties, didn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And the notion of partnering, the language of partnering, which you used
in your dealings with Wards between 1992 and the end of
1993 was language
designed to create and maintain trust between the parties, is that
right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's correct.'</i>    [T431]
<P>

365   	At transcript 437, Mr Robinson was asked and answered as
follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	</i><cite>You never intended as at 17 November 1993 that Wards was on
risk for so-called design development beyond the scope of what was defined
by
that date in the TGMP-D and drawings, did you</cite><i>?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It was intended that design development would be the risk borne by Wards
after a GMP contract was executed . . .</i>[The question was then read again
and answered:]
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>No</cite><i>.'</i>   [T437]
<P>

366   	Also at transcript 437, Mr Robinson was asked and
answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	During the phase which ended with the GMP can you point now with all the
access you need to any document which altered the definition
of the scope of
works?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Between TGMP and GMP?</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Yes . . .</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, there were some minor variations which had come about as part of the
subcontract work which was occurring on site that those
elements would have
changed the scope if that subcontract was rolled up into the GMP, which was the
intention.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You are now talking, by your reference to that subcontract, to what
became known as the 7 February 1994 subcontract, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes that's right.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Do you mean that there is a definition of work in relation to 7 February
1994 subcontract which in some respects, which you have
called minor, altered
the scope found in the TGMP-D and the drawings existing at its date?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, I was referring to variations that had occurred to the scope during
that contract.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Are there three in number?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	At the moment I recall one . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Variations to scope, they were really treated as variations under the
contract, isn't that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Not so much by changing scope, as by way of rewarding work outside
scope?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's correct, with altered moments.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Understood in that fashion those variations didn't change the definition
of scope at all, did they?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	If they were variations they were allowed to the TGMP sum of 16.7.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	If they were rewarded over and above what we will call 16.7, then they
weren't changing the definition of scope at all?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	What they were doing, in fact, were showing that the defined scope
provided the limit within which the parties could observe by
saying, this is
within and this other is outside is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.'   </i>[T438]
<P>

367   	To the best of his recollection, Mr Robinson left the
project around about 28 March 1994.  [T438]
<P>

368   	At transcript 440, Mr Robinson accepted that the notion
of `partnering' had as key principles, the concept and covenant of
good faith
and fair dealing, people working together to solve problems and coming to a
common understanding of where they were going
and how they were going to do
it.
<P>

369   	At transcript 443-444/445, Mr Robinson was shown
paragraphs 5 and 6 of the 3 August letter and answered, inter alia, as
follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	You intended Wards to regard the draft form of subcontract terms
supplied under cover of the 3 August letter as the terms on the
basis of which,
together with the other material then supplied, they were to price to Wards the
TGMP and ultimately were to go further
towards the GMP, didn't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, the whole package of documents was intended for that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The package of documents, of course, also included the covering letter
with its paragraph 5 and 6 that I've asked you about?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Didn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	But paragraph 5 is not reflected, obviously in the intended subcontract
because it talks about the process leading up to but not
beyond that
subcontract.  Do you agree?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Paragraph 6 fairly plainly looks to the post subcontract phase.  It
describes the subcontract itself, doesn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And paragraph 6 was in a letter which supplied the form of subcontract
upon which you intended Wards to base their price, wasn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And the two need to be read together somehow in order to find out what
you intended Wards to believe would be the basis of the
eventual deal, don't
they?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The form of subcontract which you supplied for that purpose included a
provision for variations, didn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And variations as a concept require the parties to know the limit within
which, or outside which, matters required by the contract,
or matters which
were variations, could be determined, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And at all times you intended Wards to believe that it was the 17th
November definition of scope which would provide that limit,
is that
right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.'</i>   
<P>

370   	At transcript 453, Mr Robinson gave evidence that his
recollection was that so far as the so-called subcontract development
privately
within Civil and Civic was concerned, between August and November 1993 he did
not intend there to be anything in altered
terms of the subcontract which
differed materially from the combination in the 3 August package.  That
continued to be his intent
until he left the job at the end of March 1994
unless during that time, during TGMP, there had been an agreement between the
parties
to alter things which had not occurred until the time he left.
<P>

371   	Mr Robinson's evidence at transcript 453, was as
follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Did you give instructions to your subordinates up until when you left to
proceed on the basis of the 3 August package providing
the meaning intended for
subcontract terms?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I did a hand over to my subordinates which included advising them on
where I believed the status of the agreement was, which was
the 3 August 1993
document.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So all your dealings with your subordinates until you left was, to the
best of your ability, to produce an eventual subcontract
entirely consistent
with and no more onerous than the 3 August package, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	With the clarification that the 3 August package had scope which was
deleted by agreement between the parties up to the letter
back from Wards of 17
November and so, therefore, with those changes made, yes.'</i>  [T453]
<P>

372   	In final address, Mr Finch emphasised, inter alia, the
following answers by Mr Robinson:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Whatever you told Mr Hayes, whatever passed between you openly in front
of Wards or privately in Civil and Civic, may his Honour
take it that you never
asked him to change the description of scope from its definition on 17 November
. . .  May his Honour take
that to be true?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, I don't believe so, because my recollection is that we were
continuing to have discussions - we had a target guarantee of maximum
price
which was a base document.  We were continuing to have meetings and discussions
about scope, about some of the fine tuning
problems that hadn't been identified
in the scope between Wards and ourselves and I would have expected Kip Hayes,
as part of his
role, to be talking to Tony Niederberger and Mike Manion about
fine tuning that into that scope.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	When you say fine tuning, do you mean something different from the
greater detail process and the economic improvement process
or do you mean
simply that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, I would have expected there could be, quite realistically, quantum
changes that would need to go on, that would implicate a
change in the price on
the project that we would be expecting Wards to have taken into account in
reaching what would be their GMP
figure.'</i>   [T473]
<P>

<b>Mr O'Connell</b>
<P>

373   	Mr O'Connell was asked at transcript 495, whether Mr
Robinson had asked him before he left the project, to set out preparing
the
documentation to be included or to constitute the GMP subcontract.  The answer
was `No he didn't.  I would say I inherited that
because it was not complete at
the time of his departure.'
<P>

374   	Mr O'Connell's evidence was that as work area team
leader, he assumed the task of preparing the documentation to be included
although he had not spoken to Mr Robinson about what Mr Robinson had in mind
for that task.  He worked it out for himself.  He had
not looked at the 3
August 1993 letter and enclosures between late March 1994 and the time when he
asked Mr Hayes to begin documenting
the Subcontract.
<P>

375   	By the time Mr Robinson left, probably in late March,
certainly by 12 April, Mr O'Connell had asked Mr Kip Hayes to set about
preparing part of the Subcontract documentation  [T496 and see 493].  Mr
O'Connell accepted that his instructions to Mr Hayes were
in accordance with
what he understood from his previous dealings.  [T497]
<P>

376   	At transcript 499, Mr O'Connell gave the following
evidence:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Did you, when you reviewed Mr Kip Hayes' work sometime in April/May
1994, being his work to produce the scope of works document
for the GMP
subcontract, deliberately set out to make that scope of works document
different in content from the scope of works as
you understood it to be as at
17 November 1993?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No I did not deliberately set out to change the scope of works as I
understood it to be.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Would it be fair to say that had you intended to be introducing a change
to the scope of works from that you understood it to be
on 17 November 1993,
you would certainly have told someone at Wards that you were doing so?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I am - I may answer that question by saying </i><cite>I gave a copy of
the scope of works to Wards to review before it went in the contract</cite><i>
. . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	I have asked you what you would have done if you set out to change the
scope from the 17 November, and you have responded by talking
about something
you actually did, have you not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I have responded.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	But you have also told his Honour three answers ago that you never set
out deliberately to change the scope, haven't you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I did not deliberately - I did not set out to deliberately change the
scope.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So you certainly didn't hand over any document actually in order to
notify of a change of scope, did you, according to your present
evidence?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Mr Walker, the scope as I understood it, the 17 November, </i><cite>was
reviewed at a meeting at Wards' offices between ourselves, and I think it was
Dick Glasgow and Mike Manion from Wards, and a number
of things on the drawings
and in the documents were substantially catered for on more than a couple of
issues.  So the understanding
- or my understanding of the scope was that it
also covered for a lot of issues not described by the bil</cite><i>l, and
covered for the intent of the project being completed fully by Wards as far as
Civil and earthworks was concerned.  Does that
answer your question?  . .
.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	According to what you've told us and please, if you want to change this
evidence, say so, you never intended to change the scope
of works from that
which you understood it to be as at 17 November.  Now is that true or
not?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is true.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Second, let me ask this, had you intended to change it, would you have
told Wards you were doing so?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	One reason why you would have told Wards you were doing so would be
because of the partnering and cooperative relationship talked
of between Wards
and Civil and Civic meant that you would be up front in your dealings;  isn't
that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That was - yes yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And during the process, or towards the end of the process of converting a
TGMP to a GMP for the same sum, it would obviously be
important to one of the
companies in this partnership arrangement to be told that the scope was
changing, wouldn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I don't believe the scope was changing . . .  If there had been a change
of scope proposed by Civil and Civic, it was obviously
important for Wards
towards the end of the process of converting a TGMP to a TGMP for the same
price to be told so;  isn't that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	According to your present evidence today, you never told Wards any such
thing because you say you never did change the scope from
17 November, is that
right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	My understanding of the scope -</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Are you able to agree with my question or not;  do you need it
again?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I've heard your question, but it all relates to my understanding of the
scope.  </i>[question repeated - according to your present evidence today, you
never told Wards any such thing because you say you never did change
the scope
from 17 November, is that right?]
<P>

<i>A.	I did not change my understanding of the scope.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Does that mean that is why you did not tell Wards about what you were
doing with the scope of works document?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I did give a copy of the scope of works document to Wards, so I did tell
them what I was doing with the scope of works document.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You have said at least three times you thought you were not changing
it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I thought I was not changing the scope of works.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You are not for a moment wanting his Honour to believe that handing a
document over was a warning of change - you're not asking
his Honour to believe
that, are you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, I am not.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You never said anything in any conversation with Wards to suggest to them
that the document, scope of works, would be different
from what was available
as at 17 November, did you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I did not say that, to them, but</i><cite> I also participated in design
meetings where it was discussed</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Where what was discussed?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	About issues such as vertical cuts in rock faces, about development of
design.  Scope as such did not change, but development of
design did so.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Between the engineers, it was as plain as a pikestaff, that design
development was an activity which would be carried on between
TGMP and the TMG
stage and also beyond, isn't that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	A lot of work was done in that direction, wasn't there?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	A lot of design development continued.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And it had nothing to do with scope because, as I think you've been
trying to point out, that was development of design within
the scope, isn't
that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Are you able to tell us whether during April/May 1994 you understood the
17 November scope to be open ended without limits?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, there were no boundaries of the 17 November scope.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	A scope without boundaries would be a contradiction in terms, wouldn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It would.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And if one party thought there were boundaries and the other party
secretly intended there not to be boundaries, then those parties
would not be
acting in a partnership way, would they?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, they would not.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Did you, for Civil and Civic, ever intend to trick Wards into signing a
scope of works document which did not impose boundaries
on the work to be
done?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, I did not deliberately intend to trick them.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And that, in your opinion, in the circumstances of 1994 would be an
outrageous violation of the partnership cooperation between
them at that time,
had it been so?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You never intended the GMP subcontract to have a scope of works document
without boundaries of the work to be done did you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No.'   </i>[T501-502]
<P>

<b>Dealing with the respective cases</b>
<P>

377   	Sufficient of the detail of the material documents and
evidence has now been set out to permit the issues to be treated with.
 As
appropriate segments of the evidence relevant to discrete issues will be
referred to.  It is, however, as well to first revisit
the respective cases.
Curiously each party ultimately sought to rely upon concessions said to have
been elicited under cross-examination
of the other parties' witnesses.
<P>

<b>Wards' case</b>
<P>

378   	Wards' written outline of final submissions was as
follows:
<P>

<i>`1.	The evidence supports the grant of statutory relief (by way of variation
of the contract) under sub-sec. 87(1) and para. 87(2)(b)
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices
Act 1974</a>.  Alternatively, were the Court's discretion to be exercised against
the grant of that form of statutory rectification, so to speak,
then a finding
should be made of the defendant's liability under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">sec. 52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade
Practices Act</a>, with damages under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">sec. 82</a> to be assessed later.  (Statutory
damages are in the alternative, rather than additional, to statutory variation
of the contract
only because the variation sought will eliminate the potential
for the contract to cause monetary loss.  Were the Court to exercise
its
statutory discretion so as to vary the contract to a lesser extent than the
plaintiff seeks, damages would be additional to such
relief.)</i>
<P>

<i>2.	The evidence also supports the grant of equitable relief viz.
rectification of the document executed on 18th May 1994 ("the GMP
sub-contract").  The plaintiff seeks rectification, properly so-called, in the
alternative to its preferred remedy of statutory variation
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">sec.
87.</a></i>
<P>

<i>3.	If the Court were to find that the circumstances enlivened the judicial
discretions to grant statutory variation or rectification,
but the Court
regarded those forms of relief as inappropriate for discretionary reasons, then
a further alternative of rescission
(by an avoidance under para. 87(2)(a) on
the statutory count, and in equity on the general law count) would remain
available and
would then be sought by the plaintiff.</i>
<P>

<i>4.	In summary, in order of preference, the plaintiff seeks (a) statutory
variation, (b) (equitable) rectification, (c) rescission,
(d) statutory
damages.</i>
<P>

<i>5.	The statutory variation of the GMP sub-contract should be made so as to
produce the GMP sub-contract in the following terms:-The
terms of the draft
sub-contract attached to the letter from Civil &amp; Civic to the Contractor
dated 3 August 1993 (`the Invitation
to Tender'), the terms of the Invitation
to Tender itself and all other documents enclosed with the Invitation to Tender
together
with</i>
<P>

<i>The terms of the draft sub-contract attached to the letter from Civil &amp;
Civic to the Contractor dated 3 August 1993 (`the Invitation
to Tender'), the
terms of the Invitation to Tender itself and all other documents enclosed with
the Invitation to Tender together
with and read subject to:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the program enclosed with the Contractor's letter of 23 August 1993 to
Civil &amp; Civic; </i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the scope of works enclosed with the Invitation to Tender refined by the
documents enclosed with the Contractor's letter of 17
November 1993; and</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	the revised Schedule of Drawings which is annexure `A'</i>
<P>

[I interpolate that in final address, Mr Walker submitted that the term
referred to in paragraph 6(a) immediately hereunder should
also be included as
part of these paragraph 5 terms.]
<P>

<i>6.	If the GMP sub-contract were to be rectified, it should be rectified in
the following way:-</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	Include in clause 1</i>
<P>

<i>"Design Development" means the development (from and after the date of
Contract) of the design of the Works by way of details or by
way of improvement
so as to enhance buildability or so as to produce savings for the Contractor,
but not in any case so as to enlarge
the scope of works in any material
way.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	Replace clause 6.30 with:</i>
<P>

<i>"Risk associated with further Design Development is to be borne by the
Contractor within the Contract Sum unless major changes are
required to the
Scope of Works by the Client."</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	Replace clauses 3.4.1, 6.3.1, 6.4.2, 6.21.2, 6.22.2, 6.24.2, 6.26.3,
6.29.1, 8.3.2, 9.4.1, 9.4.2, 9.10.1, 10.110.7.1, 10.12 and
11.1.1 with the
versions as they appear in the draft sub-contract document attached to the
Invitation to Tender</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	Delete clause 9.8.4.</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	Replace clause 6.10.3 with:</i>
<P>

<i>" The Contractor will not be entitled to a payment for a Variation resulting
from Design Development".</i>
<P>

<i>(f)	Replace the "Scope of Works" document attached to the contract dated 18
May 1994 with the document entitled "Scope of Works" dated
12 July 1993
attached to the Invitation to Tender as modified by agreements between the
Contractor and C&amp;C up to 17 November
1993 (as set out in the priced Bill of
Quantities dated 19 November 1993 (TGMP:D))</i>
<P>

<i>(g)	Replace the Schedule of Drawings with annexure `A' to these
submissions</i>
<P>

<i>(h)	Replace the reference to "Contractor's program PWFP Revision 1" in the
Schedule of Contract Programme with "Contract Program enclosed
with the
Contractor's letter of 23 August 1993 to C&amp;C"</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	Delete the reference to an amount of $20,000 per day for liquidated
damages in the Appendix</i>
<P>

<i>(j)	Delete the reference to 3 days and the words ("If nothing stated - 10
days)" in the Appendix where it references clause 9.4.2(1)</i>
<P>

<i>(k)	Delete the various rates in the Appendix where it references clause
10.4.2(1)</i>
<P>

<i>(l)	Delete the reference to the figure nil and the words "(if nothing stated
- nil)" where it references to clause 10.4.2(3)</i>
<P>

<i>7.	The evidentiary contest eventually resolved when both of the defendant's
witnesses repudiated any intention on their part, effectively,
to seek to take
advantage of unannounced, undisclosed or non-negotiated terms in the GMP
sub-contract.  Wherever those terms differed
materially from the terms to be
gathered from the combination of documents between 3rd August 1993 and 17th
November 1993, Messrs.
Robinson and O'Connell gave up any notion that the
differences were intended differences on the part of Civil &amp; Civic, let
alone
intended by Civil &amp; Civic to bind Wards.  As Mr. Robinson said, the
final allocation of risk was carried out by the 17th November
1993 acceptance
of a TGMP.</i>

drawings and so much of the Scope of Works

<i>9.	Messrs. Savage and Crangle are officers senior to Messrs. Robinson and

this project,
available to be called as witnesses but not called.  In accordance with an
ordinary application of Jones v. Dunkel

make findings against the defendant as to its corporate intention, and thus its
corporate conscience, in relation
to the form of the GMP sub-contract, with the
added confidence given by an assumption that the evidence of Messrs. Savage and
Crangle
would not have assisted Civil &amp; Civic in these regards.  This
approach is particularly strong in this case, given the obviously
deliberate
forensic choices made not to call those officers</i>
<P>

<i>T417-13</i>
<P>

<i>10.	As to some of the unexplained aspects of the way in which the GMP
sub-contract form was produced by the defendant, the failure
to call Messrs.
Dias and Hayes - being a deliberate forensic tactic - also supports a robust
use of the Jones v. Dunkel inference.
 </i>
<P>

<i>T459.16</i>
<P>

<i>11.	The combination of these approaches to the evidence called in light of
the witnesses kept away from court supports the following
findings:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	First, in accordance with Mr. Robinson's evidence, it was not the
intention of Civil &amp; Civic, whose relevant mentality on
this point must be
taken to have been his, that terms be changed in producing the GMP sub-contract
from those made known to Wards
 between 3rd August and 17th November
1993.</i>
<P>

<i>T443.34</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	Second, the 12th April 1994 Scope of Works document, produced by Mr.
Hayes under Mr. O'Connell's rather passive supervision after
Mr. Robinson left
the site at the end of March 1994, was not intended by Civil &amp; Civic to
abolish the boundaries which are essential
for the scope of works, nor to
change the scope of works from that defined by 17th November 1993.</i>
<P>

<i>T500.15</i>
<P>

<i>T502.13</i>
<P>

<i>T502.44</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	Third, if the eventual form of the GMP sub-contract is in fact contrary
to those declared intentions on the part of Civil &amp;
Civic, as it clearly
is, then this was a mishap due to a kind of mistake on the part of the Civil
&amp; Civic officers, in the context
of the trusting lack of checking on behalf
of Wards. </i>

<i>T507.09</i>
<P>

<i>T511.10</i>
<P>

<i>T511.17</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	Fourth, alternatively to the third proposition, some kind of  covert and
unmeritorious exercise was afoot within Civil &amp; Civic,
not explained in the
evidence called by Civil &amp; Civic, which produced a form of the GMP
sub-contract which belied the declared
intentions of its responsible officers
viz. Messrs. Robinson and O'Connell.</i>
<P>

<i>T507.15</i>
<P>

<i>T507.37</i>
<P>

<i>T509.18</i>
<P>

<i>12.	The importance of the partnering approach, with its emphasis on
co-operation, good faith and transparency, is that it provides
a very solid
foundation for a reasonable expectation on the part of Wards that Civil &amp;
Civic would be up front in disclosing,
discussing and negotiating changes from
the terms (including scope) known to Wards as at 17th November 1993.  The
defendant's evidence
puts the reasonableness of that expectation beyond doubt.
The same evidence concedes that silence in those circumstances would be
misleading.  See e.g. Demagogue v. Ramensky <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/557.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCA 557</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2039%20FCR%2031" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 39 F.C.R. 31</a> esp. at 32,

<i>T423.23</i>
<P>

<i>T510.50</i>
<P>

<i>13.	There is no doubt that the form of the GMP sub-contract was the
responsibility of the defendant, in the sense that it was produced
wholly by
the defendant without any participation by the plaintiff.  If the defendant's
attitude to the plaintiff's unwitting execution
of the GMP sub-contract in a
form different from what was expected remains in accordance with Mr. Hayes'
reported jibe, then in the
eyes of equity it is unconscionable for the
defendant to seek to retain the advantage of that execution.  "Well, you can
read, can't
you?" is unexplained by any evidence from the defendant, although
Mr. Hayes was manifestly available to give evidence.  It is at
least consistent
with, and probably indicates, a Civil Civic position that Wards should be bound
and held bound to terms produced
in the unilateral (i.e. secret) and somewhat
muddled way described by Mr. O'Connell - who did not even refer to the 3rd
August 1993
package or the 17th November 1993 scope to check Mr. Hayes'
work.</i>

<i>T511.10</i>
<P>

<i>14.	If the defendant now rejects the unpalatable attitude evinced by Mr.
Hayes, then in effect it concedes that both parties were
mistaken as to the
form of document executed as the GMP sub-contract.  Whatever deliberateness Mr.
Hayes or some other Civil &amp;
Civic officer displayed in preparing those
documents, the relevant guiding minds (viz. those of Messrs. Robinson and
O'Connell) did
not detect and certainly did not intend material departure from
the 3rd August - 17th November 1993 amalgam.  A finding which characterizes
the
executed document as merely  the result of this miscued intention on the part
of Messrs. Robinson and O'Connell (themselves on
behalf of the defendant)
provides the basis for the statutory variation or the rectification of the GMP
sub-contract.</i>
<P>

<i>T452.28</i>
<P>

<i>T453.09</i>
<P>

<i>T510.50</i>
<P>

<i>15.	The statutory variation of the GMP sub-contract will, by its very
nature, prevent the plaintiff from suffering the threatened
loss constituted by
the defendant's continued reliance on a form of the GMP sub-contract which was
different from that intended to
be executed by the parties or else was
different from that which the defendant appreciated the plaintiff expected to
be executing.
 For the same reason, rectification would be available in the
alternative according to established principle, as would rescission
in equity
as a further alternative.  See Taylor v. Johnson <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20151%20CLR%20422" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 151 C.L.R. 422</a> at

<P>

379   	Stripped of refinement, Civil and Civic identified what
appear to be Wards' principal or underlying contentions from which
the eleven
separate questions for determination derived, as capable of being reduced to
the following propositions:
<P>

`(i)	<i>the Plaintiff and the Defendant had an agreement as at November or
December 1993 whereby the Plaintiff would perform certain excavation,
construction and associated works at the Prospect Water Filtration Plant for a
lump sum price of $16.7 million pursuant to a scope
of works document dated 12
July 1993, drawings received under cover of a letter dated 3 August 1993  and a
priced bill of quantities
dated 19 November 1993 (the "Works");</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	the agreement was constituted by a series of communications and
circumstances, including correspondence from the Plaintiff to
the Defendant
during the period 3 August 1993 to 17 November 1993 and meetings between the
parties during the period 3 September
1993 and 5 October 1993;</i>
<P>

<i>(iii)	such agreement was subject to the signing of a formal written
subcontract which would incorporate the terms of the aforesaid
communications
and correspondence as well as "any additional or alternative terms agreed upon
between the parties";</i>
<P>

<i>(iv)	the Plaintiff commenced work on site on or about 9 December 1993;
</i>
<P>

<i>(v)	the Plaintiff's work commenced pursuant to a letter of intent dated 6
December 1993, a purchase order of December 1993 and thereafter
pursuant to an
executed early works Subcontract dated 7 February 1994 for a lump sum price of
$1,494,533.66 which were each entered
into merely as part of a bureaucratic
requirement by the Defendant to enable the Plaintiff to receive progress
payments for the works
it was then performing;</i>
<P>

<i>(vi)	the Plaintiff continued to perform works and participated in a process
known as "design development" after the December 1993
agreement was reached and
during its performance of the early works at the site from 9 December
1993;</i>
<P>

<i>(vii)	the Plaintiff continued to participate in the design development
process up until it signed a formal written Subcontract with
the Defendant on
18 May 1994;</i>
<P>

<i>(viii)	the 18 May 1994 Subcontract was executed by the Plaintiff in
circumstances where the Defendant had imposed upon the Plaintiff
by the terms
of that Subcontract the risk for further design development and did not advise
the Plaintiff of such fact;</i>
<P>

<i>(ix)	the Plaintiff trusted the Defendant by virtue of previous business
dealings to such a degree that the Plaintiff did not read
the terms and
conditions of the Subcontract prior to its execution on 18 May 1994 and that
such trust by the Plaintiff in the Defendant
was misplaced by reason of the
above circumstances.'</i>
<P>

380   	To my mind, the above propositions do represent the
essential propositions for which Wards contends.  However, hidden within
proposition (viii) is an important matter.  I refer here to the distinction
between a contract which imposes upon the subcontractor,
the risk for further
design development which is within the scope of the contract and a contract
which imposes upon the subcontractor,
the risk for further design development,
whether within or without the scope of the contract.
<P>

381   	In closing submissions, it became apparent that the
defendant did not contend [and asserted that it had never contended]
that
clause 6.30.1(b) was to be read as imposing upon Wards, the risk for further
design development beyond the scope of works identified
in the Subcontract.
<P>

382   	The matter is referred to below but needs to be
steadfastly kept in mind.
<P>

383   	I accept Civil and Civic's submission that the gravamen
of Wards case is that it signed a subcontract for the works on 18
May 1994 for
a lump sum price of $16.7million and thereby unknowingly accepted obligations
in respect of future design development
and the cost and risk thereof because
Civil and Civic inserted clause 6.30 and clause 6.10.3 into the subcontract
standard terms
and conditions and Wards, so it asserts, was not made aware of
the Civil and Civic actions.  I further accept that this simple proposition
has
been expressed in several different ways to seek various entitlements to
relief, namely:
<P>

<i>`(i)	whether the Plaintiff is entitled to rectification of the 18 May 1994
Subcontract at common law on the basis of unilateral mistake;</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	whether the Plaintiff is entitled to rectification of the 18 May 1994
Subcontract pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 87</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> by reason
that the Defendant's conduct amounted to misleading and deceptive conduct in
contravention of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a>;</i>
<P>

<i>(iii)	whether the Defendant was negligent in the circumstances giving rise
to the execution of the Subcontract;</i>
<P>

<i>(iv)	whether the Subcontract has been avoided;</i>
<P>

<i>(v)	whether the Defendant is estopped from denying that the agreement
between the Plaintiff and the Defendant is the agreement as
at December 1993;
</i>
<P>

<i>(vi)	instead of the 18 May 1994 Subcontract, whether there was an agreement
as at December 1993 for the Plaintiff to construct the
works in the manner as
alleged by the Plaintiff;</i>
<P>

<i>(vii)	if there was no agreement as at December 1993, whether the Plaintiff
is entitled to recover remuneration for work performed
on a quantum meruit
basis.'</i>
<P>

<b>Civil and Civic's Case</b>
<P>

384   	Civil and Civic's case in answer to Wards' contents is
essentially that:
<P>

<i>(i)	by letter dated 17 November 1993 the Plaintiff accepted the Defendant's
invitation dated 3 August 1993 to submit a TGMP for certain
identified works
and such TGMP had been agreed as at 17 November 1993 in the sum of $16.7
million; </i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	the Plaintiff and the Defendant participated in a process of design
development after 17 November 1993;</i>
<P>

<i>(iii)	the [Plaintiff] performed its Works on the project from 9 December
1993 on the basis of the Plaintiff's letter of intent dated
6 December 1993, a
purchase order of December 1993 and a formally executed early works Subcontract
dated 7 February 1994 in the sum
of $1,494,533.66;</i>
<P>

<i>(iv)	the Plaintiff and the Defendant executed a formal Subcontract on 18 May
1994 for the lump sum price of $16.7 million which subsumed
the arrangements
the subject of the documents referred to in (iii) above;</i>
<P>

<i>(v)	the lump sum price of $16.7 million was known as a GMP, such price being
the agreed outcome of a design development process in
which the Plaintiff and
the Defendant had participated  by since 17 November 1993;</i>
<P>

<i>(vi)	the effect of Clause 6.30 of the executed Subcontract of 18 May 1994
which imposed the risk for further design development on
the Plaintiff after 18
May 1994 was known to the Plaintiff since approximately June 1992;</i>
<P>

[here again the distinction between exposure to risk in respect of design
development post contract which was `within' or alternatively
`without scope',
is not acknowledged];
<P>

<i>(vii)	the effect of the design development clause contained in clause 6.30
of the formal written Subcontract was knowingly and willingly
accepted by the
Plaintiff and its terms were understood by it as at 18 May 1994.'</i>
<P>

<b>A `fact' case with substantial difficulties</b>
<P>

385   	The case involves much detail.  This is unavoidable
bearing in mind the dealings between the parties which led to the execution
of
the 18 May 1994 contract and the nature of the project.  To my mind, the case
is ultimately one which simply raises basal questions
of fact which once
answered are determinative of the proceedings.
<P>

386   	Wards case presents many difficulties.  It is as well to
outline these difficulties early in the peace.  The most obvious
of the
difficulties is the fact that Wards seeks to disavow a formal written contract
signed by both parties following close dealings
between them over a period of
almost a year, which dealings were, on my findings, clearly understood by both
parties as intended
to culminate in the execution of the Subcontract.  Mr
Cherrie signed the contract without examining its contents.  Wards case seeks
to outflank the well established principle that in the ordinary course where an
agreement between the parties has been reduced to
writing and the document
containing the agreement has been signed by one or both of them, the parties
signing will be bound by the
terms of the written agreement whether or not he
has read them and whether or not he is ignorant of their precise legal effect.

Without being exhaustive, the
principle will yield to mistake, misrepresentation and fraud (including no
doubt, depending
on the circumstances, unconscionable conduct).  The Court also
has the power to set aside or vary the written agreement if the Trade
Practices
counts, here pressed by Wards, are made out.  But clearly enough, as fairly
conceded early in his opening by Mr Walker
SC for Wards, Wards faces a very
difficult task in its attempt to make good these outflanking cases.  More
particularly is this so
where at every turn Wards has been guilty of gross
failure to take reasonable care of its own interests.
<P>

387   	A second difficulty is posed for Wards by reason of the
numerous admissions made by its witnesses under cross-examination
as to the
course of the pre-contract dealings between the parties.  Far from proving that
Wards was unaware that as at 18 May 1994
it would, by the terms of a lump sum
contract then being signed, undertake the risk for further design development
of the works,
the witnesses called for Wards accepted the converse, namely that
Wards was well aware of that fact.  To my mind, however, the evidence
makes
plain that these witnesses were not aware that Wards was, by the terms of the
contract to be signed, to undertake the risk
of further design development
falling outside the scope of works.  Wards set out to prove, but in my judgment
failed on the evidence
to prove, that the effect of clause 6.30 of the
Subcontract relating to that risk was imposed by Civil and Civic in
circumstances
where Wards neither understood nor accepted the risk of further
design development, `within scope', of the works and where Civil
and Civic knew
or should have known that to be the case.
<P>

388   	A third difficulty is posed for Wards by a close
examination of the facts relating to the documents in fact given to it,
as
Wards concedes, during the period leading up to the existence of the May
Subcontract.  The early works contract signed some two
months before the May
Subcontract, had included clauses identical in form to the clauses, 6.10.3 and
6.11 of the May contract, in
respect of which Wards so bitterly complains as
`unannounced, undisclosed or non-negotiated changes'.  The Scope of Works
document
which formed part of the May 1994 Subcontract document and which Wards
asserts to have been included without its knowledge and in
a fashion quite
contrary to `its understanding of the agreement' said to have been earlier
entered into, was on my findings on the
evidence, actually handed by Civil and
Civic to Wards well prior to the 18th May in circumstances where there had, on
my findings,
been discussions of a new Scope of Works document.
<P>

389   	A fourth difficulty for Wards is posed by its conduct
after the 18th May.  Far from that conduct being consistent with Wards'
case
that it was unaware that as at 18 May it would undertake the risk for further,
`within scope' design development of the works
and that it was unaware of the
effect or content of clause 6.30 of the contract, Wards no later than five days
after signing the
Subcontract was corresponding with Hornick Constructions with
a view to subcontracting part of the works to that company.  Within
a month of
18 May 1994, Wards had the opportunity to closely scrutinise the 18 May
contract and in fact did so for the purpose of
preparing and proffering to
Hornicks for execution, a subcontract almost word perfect to the May
subcontract, with amendments necessary
to tailor the document to reflect the
fact that Hornicks was to be subcontractor to Wards.  Clause 6.30 was closely
examined for
this purpose.  It is plain in my judgment, that this exercise
brought clearly home to Wards, the content of clause 6.30 as it had
appeared in
the May 1994 subcontract.  Yet no complaint as to being misled emanated at the
time from Wards.  And when such complaint
was later made by Tress Cocks &amp;
Maddox, in that firm's letter of 21 June 1995 to Civil and Civic, the complaint
was not put in
the same terms as that now presented to the Court by Wards.
Tress Cocks &amp; Maddox referred to clauses 6.10.3 and 6.30 wherein
Wards was
said to have `acknowledged that the design of the works was unfinished and that
[it] was not entitled to claim payment
for a variation in respect of Design
Development Variations'.  This, said Tress Cocks &amp; Maddox, was:
<P>

<i>`. . . contrary to information previously provided to our client and in this
regard we refer you to our client's letter to Civil and
Civic dated 17 November
1993 which reflects our client's understanding that the design </i><cite>would
be virtually complete</cite><i> by 21 January 1995.'  </i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

390   	The agreement now sued upon by Wards does not cope with
the completion of design after Contract.  The concept of `virtual
completion'
of a design plainly raises special difficulties.
<P>

391   	This outline of the difficulties which Wards faces is not
to be taken as exhaustive.  It will be referred to from time to
time
hereunder.
<P>

392   	Of relevance also is the fact that Civil and Civic does
not contend and asserts that it has never contended that the proper
construction of clause 6.30.1(b) would permit it to direct that matters which
would otherwise constitute variations <u>outside</u> the scope of works require
to be completed by Wards without remuneration, as being 'design development
variations'. This concession
points up the fact that the evidence of witnesses
called by both parties as to their contemporaneous understanding of the basis
of
their dealings was at the end of the day, not materially dissimilar.
Naturally, however, the factual issue as to what was the agreed
scope of works
requires determination.
<P>

393   	It is convenient to first briefly turn to some matters of
principle, more particularly relating to unilateral mistake, <i>Taylor v
Johnson</i> and rectification.
<P>

<b>Unilateral Mistake</b>
<P>

394   	Where one party is mistaken as to the terms of a contract
and the other party is not, a case of unilateral mistake, the mistaken
party
will not be relieved of the contract on the ground of the mistake alone. The
presumption is that a party is bound by the objectively,
rather than the
subjectively, determined terms of the contract. This presumption, referred to
as the `objective principle', has the
effect that a party is bound, in spite of
their mistake where, `whatever [his] real intention may be, he so conducts
himself that
a reasonable man would believe that he was assenting to the terms
proposed by the other party, and that other party upon that belief
enters into
a contract with him': <i>Smith v Hughes</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281871%29%20LR%206%20QB%20597" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1871) LR 6 QB 597</a> at 607.  
<P>

395   	This presumption is clearly motivated by the Court's
recognition of the importance of treating a formal contract, particularly
in a

396   	In <i>Taylor v Johnson</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/5.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 5</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20151%20CLR%20422" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 151 CLR 422</a> the High
Court was required to deal with the effect at common law of unilateral mistake
as to the existence or content of a term
of a written contract. In holding that
the contract was valid at law, Mason ACJ, Murphy and Deane JJ in joint
judgement, considered
at 431 `the scope of the basis on which relief in equity
is available from the contractual consequences of unilateral mistake'. Their
Honours accepted that the basis of equity's jurisdiction to set aside a
contract for unilateral mistake was equity's ordinary jurisdiction
to deny
enforcement of a party's legal rights where such enforcement would be
`unconscientious': see Lindgren, Carter and Harland
<i>Contract Law in
Australia</i>, Butterworths, 1986, paragraph 1257.
<P>

397   	The mere existence of a unilateral mistake, no matter how
serious, will not make unconscionable the other party's insistence
on
performance of the contract as agreed, some implication of the unmistaken party
is necessary. This is made plain by Russell LJ
in <i>Riverlate Properties Ltd v
Paul</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20Ch%20133" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] Ch 133</a> who stated as follows:
<P>

<i>`If reference be made to principles of equity, it operates on conscience. If
conscience is clear at the time of the transaction, why
should equity disrupt
the transaction? If a man may be said to have been fortunate in obtaining a
property at a bargain price, or
on terms that make it a good bargain, because
the other party unknown to him has made a miscalculation or other mistake, some
high-minded
men might consider it appropriate that he should agree to a fresh
bargain to cure the miscalculation or mistake, abandoning his good
fortune. But
if equity were to enforce the views of those high-minded men, we have no doubt
that that it would run counter to the
attitudes of much the greater part of
ordinary mankind (not least the world of commerce) and would be venturing upon
the field of
moral philosophy in which it would soon be in
difficulties.'</i>
<P>

398   	In <i>Taylor v Johnson</i> it was made clear that
`special circumstances' would ordinarily require to be shown before the
requisite unconscientiousness could
be established. In that case Mrs Johnson
granted to Mr Taylor or his nominee(s) an option to purchase two adjoining lots
of vacant
land, being approximately 10 acres in total. The option was exercised
by Mr Taylor's nominees, his two children, who entered into
a written contract
of sale with Mrs Johnson. In both the option and the contract of sale the total
price stipulated for the land
was $15,000. A dispute then arose as to the
stipulated price, Mrs Johnson refusing to perform the contract on the ground
that when
she executed the written agreements she believed that they provided
for a consideration of $15,000 <i>per acre</i>, a total price of approximately
$150,000. When Mr Taylor's nominees commenced proceedings for specific
performance of the contract
of sale, Mrs Johnson instituted counter proceedings
against them and Mr Taylor seeking rectification of the option agreement and
the contract of sale, or alternatively, rescission of the contract. 
<P>

399   	At first instance, Powell J held that Mrs Johnson had
mistakenly believed that the agreements provided for a price of $15,000
per
acre, however, that `on the balance of probabilities' his honour found Mr
Taylor was unaware of her mistake. Accordingly, Powell
J ordered specific
performance of the contract. On appeal by the vendor, the contract was set
aside, each member of the Court of
Appeal having concluded that Taylor believed
that the Mrs Johnson was probably mistaken as to what the option and contract
stipulated
as the price. The purchasers appealed to the High Court. The
majority of the High Court upheld the Court of Appeal decision. In joint
judgement, Mason ACJ, Murphy and Deane JJ held, over the vigorous dissent of
Dawson J, that it was open to the Court of Appeal to
come to a different
conclusion on the crucial fact of Taylor's knowledge of the mistake from that
reached by the trial judge. The
majority considered the case to be one where
the unmistaken party deliberately set out to ensure that the mistaken party did
not
become aware of the existence of the mistake.

that:
<P>

<i>`. . . a party who has entered into a written contract under a serious
mistake about its contents in relation to a fundamental term
will be entitled
in equity to an order rescinding the contract if the other party is aware that
circumstances exist which indicate
that the first party is entering the
contract under some serious mistake or misapprehension about either the content
or subject matter
of that term and deliberately sets out to ensure that the
first party does not become aware of the existence of his mistake or
misapprehension.'
</i>
<P>

401   	Their Honours continued as follows:
<P>

<i>`What we have said is sufficient to demonstrate the broad basis of support
which the authorities provide for that proposition. Moreover,
and perhaps more
importantly, it is a principle which is best calculated to do justice between
the parties to a contract in the situation
which it contemplates. In such a
situation it is unfair that the mistaken party should be held to the written
contract by </i><cite>the other party whose lack of precise knowledge of the
first party's actual mistake proceeds from wilful ignorance</cite><i> because,
knowing or having reason to know that there is some mistake or misapprehension,
he engages deliberately in a course of conduct
which is designed to inhibit
discovery of it.'  [Emphasis added]</i>
<P>

402   	In this way, in cases of unilateral mistake, the focus
for the Court is on conduct that relates directly to the mistake and
antedates
the formation of the contract.
<P>

403   	The majority thought Mr Taylor had been guilty of 'sharp
practice', whilst Dawson J in minority, did not. Accordingly, the
decision was
that the contract should be set aside. It is the notion of 'sharp practice'
which presents some difficultly in the judgement.
How is it to be identified?
In what circumstances may mere silence amount to sharp practice? It is clear
that the majority endorsed
an objective test for determining the unmistaken
party's knowledge of the other party's mistake. Yet the majority also thought
it
necessary that the unmistaken party must 'deliberately set out to ensure
that the first party does not become aware of the .... mistake
or
misapprehension'. Such behaviour is only consistent with subjective knowledge
of the mistake or, at the very least, a strong suspicion
coupled with a
deliberate lack of inquiry: see N. Seddon,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20296" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) ALJ 296</a> at 298.
<P>

404   	Notwithstanding this difficulty, mistake as to the
contents of a contract is clearly one of fact. In <i>Contract Law in Australia,
</i>the learned authors point out at paragraph 1245 that a mistaken party will
not often be able to discharge the onus of showing that
the other party knew or
must have known that the mistaken party intended terms different from the terms
of offer and acceptance.
<P>

405   	The grant of equitable relief to the mistaken party by
way of refusing specific performance or rescission of the contract
was clearly
in the contemplation of the High Court in <i>Taylor v Johnson</i>. The remedy
of rectification, however, was not pursued in the circumstances of the case.

<P>

406   	I turn to examine rectification in the case of unilateral
mistake particularly.
<P>

407   	Rectification is available as a discretionary remedy
where there has been a mistake, not in the making, but in the recording,
of a
contract: see <i>Treitel, The Law of Contract</i>, seventh edition at 245. This
was clearly put by James VC in <i>Mackenzie v Coulson </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281869%29%20LR%208%20Eq%20369" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1869) LR 8 Eq 369</a> at
375: "Courts of equity do not rectify contracts; they may and do rectify
instruments" to accord with the parties' intention. See
also <i>The Olympic
Pride </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%2067" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 2 Lloyd's Rep 67.</a>
<P>

408   	It is important to keep in mind as the authors of
<i>Contract Law in Australia</i> point out at paragraph 1270, that `common
intention as to what an instrument shall say' is not to be equated with `common
belief
or understanding as to what effect an instrument shall produce' - cf
<i>Frederick E Rose (London) Ltd v William Hernani Pim Junior &amp; Co Ltd</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1953%5d%202%20QB%20450" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1953] 2 QB 450</a>; <i>Pukallus v Cameron</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/63.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 63</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%2043%20ALR%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 43 ALR 243.</a>
<P>

409   	Rectification is most commonly granted where the terms of
a document do not correspond with those of the agreement between
the parties.
It is not necessary that there be a prior binding contract between the parties,
only that the document to be rectified
be preceded by a concluded agreement or
a `continuing common intention' -cf <i>The Olympic Pride </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%2067" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 2 Lloyd's
Rep 67.</a> It is, however, an insufficient ground for rectification that the
parties had conducted antecedent negotiations on the point for
which
rectification is sought, for such negotiations may not have led to a concluded
agreement on the particular point, or, if they
did, that agreement may not have
been maintained until the execution of the document. See <i>Treitel, The Law of
Contract</i>, seventh edition at 248. 
<P>

410   	Clearly, it would be inequitable to foist upon an
unmistaken party a contract they did not intend to make. Accordingly, in
<i>Agip S.p.A. v Navigazione Alta Italia S.p.A. </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 Lloyd's Rep 353</a>, a
case where the defendant's did not know of the plaintiff's mistake, the mistake
being attributable not to the defendant's conduct,
but caused solely by the
plaintiff's own carelessness in not reading the charter carefully,
rectification was denied. However, where
the unmistaken party is in some way
implicated in the mistake, a grant of rectification may be appropriate.
<P>

411   	In <i>A Roberts &amp; Co Ltd v Leicestershire County
Council</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1961%5d%20Ch%20555" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1961] Ch 555</a>, rectification of a contract was granted in
circumstances where one party was mistaken that a particular term had been
included.
In that case, a construction company submitted a tender to a council
which specified a certain completion period for the work, that
period being
indexed to the stated price for the work. Subsequently, the council conveyed
its acceptance of the tender to the company,
asking it to execute the work in
accordance with the tender. However, the formal contract which the council's
officers caused to
be prepared, and which the company unwittingly executed,
stated a different completion period for the work. The council's officers
knew
that the company mistakenly believed that the period specified in the tender
had been reproduced in the contract.
<P>

412   	Pennycuick J ordered rectification of the contract on the
basis that although the mistake was not common, where one party
to the contract
is aware that an instrument contains a mistake in their favour but does nothing
to correct it, that party is precluded
from resisting rectification on the
ground that the mistake was unilateral not common. His Honour stated:
<P>

<i>'. . . a party is entitled to rectification of a contract upon proof that he
believed a particular term to be included in the contract,
and that the other
party concluded the contract with the omission or a variation of that term in
the knowledge that the first party
believed the term to be included.</i>
<P>

413   	This statement was adopted by the English Court of Appeal
in <i>Riverlate Properties Ltd v Paul</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20Ch%20133" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] Ch 133</a> at 140 and later in <i>

<P>

414   	More recently in <i>Commission for the New Towns v Cooper
(Great Britain) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%20Ch%20259" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] Ch 259</a> Stuart-Smith LJ, who wrote the leading
judgement, qualified this proposition, having the effect that it is now in line
with the majority
decision in <i>Taylor v Johnson</i>. In the <i>Commission for
New Towns</i>, the question to be determined was whether there was a binding
agreement between the parties allowing the defendant to require the
plaintiff
to accept the surrender of a commercial lease. 
<P>

415   	The facts of the case, being quite complex, are
appropriate to be set out. In 1986 the plaintiff leased commercial premises
for
a period of 25 years to a company B which immediately assigned the lease to
company E. Subsequently, the plaintiff entered into
4 deeds with company E
providing for building works to adapt the premises for company E; for a 'side
option' to lease adjacent premises;
for appropriate notice to be given if
company E required larger premises; and most importantly to the dispute, a 'put
option,' binding
the plaintiff to take assignment of the lease from company E
on the latter giving appropriate notice. The put option was expressed
as
personal to company E and to expire on its assigning the lease or parting with
possession of the premises. 
<P>

416   	In 1987 company E sold its business on the premises to
the defendant, who subsequently acquired, with the consent of the
plaintiff,
the unexpired portion of the lease. By 1990 the defendant was considering
closing the business if no buyer could be found.
In view of this event, the
defendant sought to obtain the benefit of the put option which was originally
granted to company E, but
which became void upon assignment of the lease. It
was recognised that open negotiation of such an option would be difficult and
that it would be better to proceed so as to obtain the right in such a way that
the plaintiff would not know what it was granting.
To this end, a meeting was
held where the defendant's representatives expressed a wish to the plaintiff to
have the rights which
company E had enjoyed, and they mentioned the side option
so as to give the impression that expansion of the business was contemplated.
Following the meeting, the defendant sent to the plaintiff a letter stating,
inter alia, that "You confirmed at our meeting that
you will treat [the
defendant] in all respects as having the same rights and benefits under the
original documentation as [company
E]." In due course the plaintiff accepted
the defendant's terms, confirming the agreement in writing. Upon receipt of
this confirmation,
the defendant revealed for the first time that it was
operating at a loss and purported to exercise the put option. The plaintiff
sought to have the contract rectified to ensure that the defendant could not
surrender the lease.
<P>

417   	At first instance Micklem J held that the plaintiff had
granted the defendant the put option and that as the defendant did
not have
actual knowledge of the plaintiff's mistake, the plaintiff was not entitled to
rectification of the contract to accord with
what it thought was agreed.
However, Micklem J further held that the correspondence between the parties did
not constitute an exchange
of contracts so as to satisfy legislative
requirements, thus was unenforceable. The defendant appealed this latter part
of the decision
and the plaintiff cross-appealed on the basis that
rectification should have been granted. 
<P>

418   	The Court of Appeal allowed the cross-appeal, concluding
per Stuart-Smith LJ that the plaintiff was entitled to succeed as
a matter of
construction of the contract, upon equitable grounds and as a result of the
relevant legislative requirements. As to
the equitable grounds, his Lordship
characterised the debate on this ground as turning on what amounts to
'unconscionable conduct'.
In refuting the proposition that actual knowledge of
the mistake on the part of the unmistaken party is essential to the granting
of
rectification (<i>Agip S.p.A. v Navigazione Alta Italia S.p.A. </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20Lloyds%20Rep%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1
Lloyd's Rep 353)</a>, Stuart-Smith LJ stated the general proposition as to the
requisite knowledge of the unmistaken party as follows:
<P>

<i>`. . . where A intends B to be mistaken as to the construction of the
agreement, so conducts himself that he diverts B's attention
from discovering
the mistake by making false and misleading statements, and B in fact makes the
very mistake that A intends, then
notwithstanding that A does not actually
know, but merely suspects, that B is mistaken, and it cannot be shown that the
mistake was
induced by any misrepresentation, rectification may be granted.'
[at 280]</i>
<P>

419   	D. Mossop, in his paper entitled 'Rectification for
Unilateral Mistake' published at  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2010%20Journal%20of%20Contract%20Law%20259" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 10 <i>Journal of Contract Law</i> 259</a>,
reviewed the decision in <i>Commission for New Towns</i> and concluded as
follows:
<P>

<i>`...in so far as the decision [in Commission for New Towns] indicates that
rectification for unilateral mistake should be freed from
a strict requirement
for actual knowledge it is correct and provides a foundation upon which a more
secure statement of the correct
principle can be built.</i>' [at 263]
<P>

420   	To my mind, the principle applied in <i>Commission for
New Towns,</i> while in the context of a mistake as to the construction rather
than the content of the contract, and dealing with a grant of rectification
of
the contract rather than rescission, is embraced by the reasoning applied by
the majority in <i>Taylor v Johnson </i>at 432.  [See the passage with emphasis
extracted earlier in this Judgment].  This is clearly in the contemplation of
Stuart-Smith
LJ who cited the proposition stated in <i>Taylor</i> with approval
notwithstanding the recognised variance.
<P>

421   	<i>Snell's Equity</i>, 29th edition, 1990 at 630-1 puts
the matter as follows:
<P>

<i>'By what appears to be a species of equitable estoppel, if one party to a
transaction knows that the instrument contains a mistake
in his favour but does
nothing to correct it, he (and those claiming under him) will be precluded from
resisiting rectification on
the ground is unilateral not common. Under this
head the evidence of the knowledge and intention of the defendant must be such
as
to involve him in a degree of sharp practice, or at least 'the conduct must
be such as to affect the conscience of the party who
has suppressed the fact
that he has recognised the presence of a mistake'.'</i>
<P>

<b>General concessions</b>
<P>

422   	As appears from the more detailed excerpts of cross
examination set out in the Judgment, Wards witnesses made a number of
key
concessions. These included the following:
<P>

<b>Draft subcontract incomplete</b>
<P>

423   	It was generally accepted by Mr Cherrie, Mr Levido and Mr
Niederberger that the draft subcontract enclosed with J1 was not
a meaningful
contract and would not be such until the blanks in that document were filled
in. 
<P>

424   	Further, it was generally accepted by Mr Levido that the
terms of the draft subcontract were not resolved at the time it
was provided
and it would need to be amended before being signed by both parties.
<P>

425   	It was generally accepted by Mr Cherrie that the initial
process leading up to an agreement with the TGMP did not constitute
a contract
for the construction of anything. Right up to the time when the subcontract was
signed, Mr Ward and Mr Cherrie generally
understood that there may or may not
have been a contract.
<P>

<b>Risk of design development </b>
<P>

426   	It was generally accepted by the witnesses from Wards
that there were three phases of design development involved in the
water
filtration plant project. They were, the phase leading up to the submission of
a TGMP for the project, the phase between TGMP
and GMP and the phase after
contract.
<P>

427   	The evidence given by Mr Ward and Mr Pittolo is that it
was up to Wards to decide whether the design changes post settlement
of the
TGMP had made the work more expensive and as such, whether it wanted to
nominate a higher GMP.  Mr Ward, Mr Cherrie and Mr
Levido generally accepted
that if Wards got the exercise (of nominating the GMP) wrong, it could be
exposed to significant loss.
<P>

428   	Mr Ward, Mr Pittolo, Mr Niederberger and Mr Levido
generally accepted that Wards was aware and did not dissent from, the
concept
of Wards bearing the risk of design development post contract, unless major
changes to scope were required by the client
for which Civil and Civic received
additional funds. It was accepted by Mr Cherrie, Mr Levido and Mr Niederberger
that this awareness
is evidenced by the respective handwritten notes taken by
Mr Levido and Mr Niederberger at the meeting of 22 October 1993.
<P>

429   	Mr Ward and Mr Niederberger accepted that risk of design
development (subject to the limited exception) flowed both from
design
development suggested by Wards and design development suggested by Civil and
Civic. Further, Mr Ward accepted that the concept
of design development exposed
Wards to risk which might otherwise be a variation.
<P>

430   	It was generally accepted by the witnesses from Wards
that the concept of risk development which governed the relationship
between
Wards and Civil and Civic is encapsulated in paragraph 6 of J6.  Messrs Ward,
Cherrie and Niederberger accepted that Wards
was aware that this paragraph was
to be incorporated as a contractual term in the final subcontract and that the
paragraph was meant
to speak from the time when the contract was signed, being
referable to whatever the scope was at that time.
<P>

<b>Scope of works</b>
<P>

431   	Mr Pittolo accepted that the scope of works determines
who bears the risk in respect of particular work or changes in the
work.  Also
that the bill of quantities did not go to who bore the risk in respect of
particular work or changes in the work.
<P>

432   	It was generally accepted by Messrs Pittolo, Levido and
Niederberger that the scope of works was changing from time to time
and Mr
Levido accepted that prior to signing off on the final subcontract, Wards would
need to look at the work programme current
at the time and make sure it was
acceptable to Wards.
<P>

433   	Mr Pittolo accepted that the Scope of Works provided by S
O'Connell in 1994 had to be different to the 3 August 1993 Scope
of Works.  He
also accepted that that scope of works represented an update of the 3 August
1993 Scope of Works.
<P>

<b>Design not fully complete post-contract </b>
<P>

434   	Mr Pittolo and Mr Levido accepted that Wards was aware
that when the final contract for lump sum came to be signed, the design
of the
project was not finally complete. As such, Messrs Pittolo and Levido were aware
that drawing schedules would need to be amended
from time to time to take up
the extent of the changes or alterations in the design.  Mr Levido's evidence
was that it was Wards'
intention that changes brought about by amendments to
the design were to be monitored.
<P>

435   	The evolution of design is evidenced by the minutes of
some 32 design meetings, attended by representatives of both parties,
that took
place up to 18 May 1994.
<P>

<b>Tension requiring resolution by final contract </b>
<P>

436   	The evidence is that key players at Wards appreciated (at
varying times) the tension between design development and variations
prior to
and after the signing of the contract by Wards.
<P>

437   	Messrs Ward, Cherrie, Levido and Niederberger accepted
that there was tension between the 3 August 1993 and 23 August 1993
letters and
that this had not been resolved prior to signing of the lump sum contract.
<P>

438   	Messrs Levido and Pittolo accepted that it follows that a
formal contract was then required to finalise agreement.
<P>

<b>Finalisation of agreement</b>
<P>

439   	It was generally accepted by witnesses from Wards that as
at 17 November 1993 both parties were well aware that there was
to come into
existence a formal subcontract which would pull together the various matters
discussed and it wasn't until and unless
that subcontract was signed that Wards
and Civil and Civic could be taken to have agreed to do the work set out in the
drawings current
at the time.
<P>

440   	Mr Pittolo accepted that there was agreement between the
parties on all matters as of 18 May 1994.
<P>

<b>Wards' failure to read the subcontract</b>
<P>

441   	It was generally accepted by witnesses from Wards that
the person signing the subcontract of 18 May 1994 would need to check
certain
matters: that the terms proposed by Wards were accepted and incorporated into
the contract, or the tension between the 3
August and 23 August 1993 otherwise
resolved;  that a term was incorporated that accurately reflected paragraph 6
of the 3 August
1993 and that the list of drawings in the contract was current
to 18 May 1994 and acceptable.
<P>

<b>Hornicks subcontract dated 17 June 1994</b>
<P>

442   	It was generally accepted by witnesses from Wards that
the Hornicks subcontract was adapted from the 18 May 1994 subcontract
between
Civil and Civic and Wards. 
<P>

443   	The evidence was that the changes to the subcontract
could not have been left to a general assistant. The adaptations, which
were
undertaken by Mr Pittolo, did not simply involve changing all "Wards"
references to "Hornicks" and all "C&amp;C" references
to "WCE" - further
definitions and other non standard changes were required. In particular, I note
that Mr Pittolo, after making
the standard change of "C&amp;C" to "WCE" in
clause 6.30.2, saw that it did not make sense and so changed "WCE" to
"Client".
<P>

444   	It follows that a key player at Wards was necessarily
familiar with clauses 6.10 and 6.30 of the subcontract prior to 17
June 1994.
This negates Wards' claim that it did not become aware of that clause until
much later. Further, Mr Pittolo accepted that
clauses 6.10 and 6.30 were in
accordance with the understanding he had always had in relation to design
development and variations.
These clauses also reflected the allocation of risk
as between Civil and Civic and Wards as understood by Mr Cherrie.
<P>

445   	I turn then to examine the course of dealings with more
specific reference to the detailed J documents.
<P>

<b>The Course of Dealings</b>
<P>

446   	To my mind, the correspondence between the parties
between June 1992 and 17 November 1993 and the objective file notes recording
what occurred at certain of the meetings which took place between those dates,
clearly establishes that there was to be a `bid' phase
and a `post-bid'
phase.
<P>

447   	Part of the materials enclosed under cover of Civil and
Civic's invitation to tender, submitted to Wards on 23 June 1992
[J1],
delineated between the bid phase and the post-bid phase [see the section headed
`General' forming part of the Scope of Works
document - earlier set out].
Plainly Wards was then on notice that after the bid phase it was to be
responsible for participation
in design development.  This was to ensure that
`document intent as priced and detailed [remained] within the fixed price
provided
by Wards for submission'.  Risk on design development was clearly
announced as risk which `is therefore borne by Wards unless major
changes to
scope' were required by the client, NSW Water Services or the Water Board.  In
the case of `major changes', a new price
would be required and Wards would need
to show `that rates and commercial viability are in line with the original
document'.
<P>

448   	Mr Cherrie accepted that until the blanks in the blank
subcontract enclosed with J1 were filled in, one could not have a
meaningful
contract [T128.35].
<P>

449   	Mr Levido accepted that the concept of Wards bearing the
risk of design development unless major changes to scope were required
by the
client, stayed the same throughout his association with the project and that
there was never any dissent from Wards.  [T220.05]
<P>

450   	Mr Levido also accepted that the draft contract provided
with the letter, J1,  was a blank contract and would need to be
amended and
added to before it could be signed by the parties [T221.35].
<P>

451   	Mr Pittolo, in relation to document J1, gave evidence
that at no time prior to the signature of the subcontract did he look
at any
draft or other version of the subcontract [T265.35];  that changes to the
drawings might result in changes to the scope of
works [T266.05];  that when he
came on board the project, he knew that it was likely that when the final
contract came to be signed,
the design would not be finally complete [T267.30];
that one of the things that was a feature of the proposed arrangement between
the parties was that it was made quite clear to Wards that when they finally
signed up for the lump sum, the design might not be
complete finally [T268.5];
and that his understanding of design risk from the time he joined the project
up to the time he left was
similar to that contained in the June 1992 Scope of
Works document, namely that risk on design development was borne by Wards
unless
major changes to scope were required by the client [T268.55].
<P>

452   	Mr Niederberger under cross-examination, in relation to
document J1, gave evidence that when he came onto the project, he
understood
the statement that `after the bid phase, Wards will be responsible for the
participation in design development' to be
true [T371.45];  and that he
understood to be true that the risk on design development was to be Wards
unless major changes of scope
were required by the client [T372.25].
<P>

453   	By 25 June 1992, the parties had engaged in `ongoing
discussions over three months' leading to the submission by Wards under
cover
of letter of that date, of its `preliminary final assessment' for the relevant
works.  Importantly, that letter [J2]:
<P>

<i>(a)	included an item for `design contingency' making provision for
$1,130,000;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	included express reference to further discussions being anticipated to
include `risk assessment particulars with respect to design'.</i>
<P>

454   	Clearly enough, there would have been no need to include
the reference to `risk assessment particularly with respect to design',
had the
parties been looking forward to a standard subcontract with a clause providing
for variations in the usual way to be found
in lump sum building contracts.
<P>

455   	Under cross-examination in relation to document J2, Mr
Ward gave evidence that different persons had different understandings
of the
words `design development' [T52.40].
<P>

456   	Under cross-examination, in relation to document J2, Mr
Levido gave evidence that he was aware of the competition between
design
development and variations by August 1993, that this tension was clear to him
as from August 1993 and never changed for as
long as he was involved in the
project [T225.55];  that there was simply no doubt that after Wards signed the
contract, it was quite
clear that it had design development risks [T228.55];
and that it was always appreciated that drawing schedules such as those
provided
in 1992 would need to be and were in fact amended from time to time to
take up the extent of changes or alterations in the design.
 [T230.10]
<P>

457   	As early as 1 July 1992, Mr Glasgow of Wards had already
focussed on the importance of achieving, for the purposes of finalising
Wards'
submission, a proper understanding of how, within the contractual documents to
be brought into existence, the potential tension
between what would be a
`variation', and what would be `design development', was to be reconciled.  Mr
Glasgow's note, deserves to
be repeated.  It read:
<P>

<i>`Scope of Work/Variations</i>
<P>

<i>Given that the project is still in the stages of design development and the
detail of scope of work is unable to be closely defined
- what constitutes a
variation?  How will it be differentiated from a "design development
encompassed in the original scope"?'</i>
<P>

458   	At the centre of this case stands Wards' contention that
close to two years later, it signed a contract which so differentiated
but
failed to take the time or trouble to read the relevant clauses.
<P>

459   	Wards' tender submitted to Civil and Civic under cover of
letter of 7 July 1992 [J3], allowed `a small global risk contingency
to cover
the costs of details not available on the `preliminary' drawings'.
<P>

460   	Plainly enough, the drawings at that stage and thereafter
were undergoing a process of gradual evolution.  The list of drawings
upon
which Wards' 7 July 1992 lump sum price was said to be based, had been revised
on a number of occasions by 7 July 1992 - see
the abbreviated number revisions,
part of the Drawing Schedule enclosed with document J3.  The evidence clearly
establishes that
drawings were further revised up to May 1994.  Appended to
this Judgment as Appendix L is a document which records the dates of and
transmittal number by which the 18 May 1994 contract drawings, as well as
specifications, were transmitted by Civil and Civic to
Wards.
<P>

461   	It is common ground that some 32 design meetings took
place up to 18 May 1994.  These were attended by representatives of
both
parties.  The minutes are in evidence.  They clearly evidenced the evolution of
design.
<P>

462   	Further clarification of Civil and Civic's intent during
the `post-bid' phase, to work towards establishing a contract with
Wards, is to
be found in Civil and Civic's letter to Wards of the 16th July 1992 [J4].
<P>

463   	The crucial 3 August 1993 Civil and Civic letter [J6],
has been set out in full.  Paragraphs 5 and 6 were clear.  The letter
outlined
the three phases in contemplation.  The first was up to TGMP acceptance.  The
second was from TGMP acceptance to contract.
 And following contract (the third
phase), `any risks associated with further design development' was to be borne
by Wards within
GMP, with one exception.  This letter did not include any
warranty by Civil and Civic that at the time of contract, design would
be
`complete' or would be `virtually complete'.
<P>

464   	The Scope of Works [PX3 page 142 - part of J6]
importantly made plain that it was provided for the purpose of pricing of
Wards' TGMP:
<P>

<i>`The following civil and structural components will form the works
</i><cite>for pricing of a . . . TGMP by Wards</cite><i> . . . `.
</i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

465   	The section of the Scope of Works under the heading
`General' was, with one immaterial exception, word perfect to that form
of
words enclosed with J1.
<P>

466   	The drawings enclosed with J6 had again been revised.
<P>

467   	Under cross-examination in relation to document J6, Mr
Ward gave evidence that paragraph 6 of the letter was clear at the
time he read
it and that he was clear that, in the event that Civil and Civic contracted
with Wards, any risk associated with further
design development after the time
of contract, was to be borne by Ward unless there was a major change to scope
required by the client
for which Civil and Civic received additional funds
[T20.05];  and that he understood that Wards was responsible for design
development
[T21.45];  that the only exception to Wards' responsibility for
design development, was where there was a major change to scope by
the client
where moneys would go from the client to Civil and Civic [T22.15];  that the
terms of paragraph 6 would have to be incorporated
in the contract [T24.10];
that Wards accepted that paragraph 6 was a term which either did or was to
govern the contractual relationship
between the parties [T25.30];  that it
continued to be his understanding from August 1993 to May 1994 that a term such
as that in
paragraph 6 of the letter, governed the relationship between Civil
and Civic and Wards [T27.50];  that paragraph 6 of the letter
expressed the
design development risk and Wards' appreciation of it [T39.55];  that Wards
cannot point to any document which indicates
that Wards' exposure to design
development risk was limited to design developments suggested by Wards - and
that there is nothing
in the letter to that effect and that the 23 November
1993 letter from Wards to Hornicks shows that Mr Manion perceived that design
development might involve what would otherwise be a variation [T56.20];  and
that it is clear from the documents produced by Ward
up to November 1993 and
from as early as July 1992 that Wards was exposed to risk as a result of design
development which might otherwise
be a variation [T57.20].
<P>

468   	Mr Cherrie, under cross-examination in relation to
document J6, gave evidence that the initial process was leading up to
no more
than an agreement within the TGMP - that once the TGMP was agreed between the
parties, there was no guarantee that Wards
would end up with the contract - and
that the agreement of a TGMP did not constitute a contract for the construction
of anything
[T134.45];  that there were a number of phases of design
development, these being the phase leading to the submission of a TGMP,
the
phase between TGMP and GMP and the phase after contract [T136.30];  that he
understood that right up to the time when the contract
was signed, there may or
may not be a contract [T138.15];  that a number of things were clear from the 3
August 1993 letter, namely
that there may or may not be a contract;  that if
there was going to be a contract, it was subject to a condition that further
design
development after contract was a risk borne by Wards;  that there was an
exception where there was a major change to scope required
by the client for
which Civil and Civic got money;  however, if the client did not require a
variation which resulted in money being
paid to Civil and Civic, Wards were
stuck with the design development risk [T138.35];  that paragraph 6 of the
letter is a contractual
provision which is meant to speak from the time when
the contract is signed <u>and is referable to whatever the scope is at that
time </u>[T140.05];  that the draft contract submitted with the letter was a
blank subcontract which was not in any way adapted to the project
and would
require the incorporation of a term reflecting paragraph 6 of the letter one
could not make a meaningful contract out of
it without filling it in or being
able to fill in the blanks;  and that paragraph 6 of the letter continued to
represent his understanding
up to and including May 1994 of the exposure of
Wards to design development risk [T143.25].
<P>

469   	Mr Levido's evidence in relation to the document J6, was
that all the way to the time of contract the works may change in
detail or
scope [T231.25];  that Wards was accepting further design development risk
after the time of contract with the exception
mentioned in the letter
[T233.30];  that Wards had the risk of design development after contract
[T234.30];  that the actual concept
of design development remained constant
during the entirety of his involvement with the project [T235.20];  and that
the concept
of design development had to be addressed in the contract before
signing [T236.25].
<P>

470   	Mr Pittolo gave evidence under cross-examination in
relation to the letter document J6, that there would be design changes
between
TGMP and GMP;  that it was up to Wards to decide whether or not at the end of
that process, it wanted to nominate a different
GMP;  that if, for instance,
Wards perceived that design changes had made the work significantly more
expensive, it might put its
hand up for a higher GMP [T271.55];  that he
understood in January that if Wards contracted with Civil and Civic any risk
associated
with further design development were to be borne by Wards and the
only exception was if there were major changes to scope required
by the client
for which additional funds were made available to Civil and Civic [T272.40];
that somebody needed to address the blanks
in the blank subcontract to put in
the contractual terms in relation to design development and variations
[T274.10];  <u>that it was obvious that the scope of works provided by Mr
O'Connell in 1994 had to be different to the 3 August 1993 scope of works
</u>[T329.45];  that the scope of works talks about the sort of work in general
terms which is to be done and the sort of risks each party
bears in respect of
that work [T331.55];  that the Scope of Works provided by Mr O'Connell in 1994
had to be an update of the scope
of works in the letter [T332.5];  that the
scope of works says who bears the risk in respect of particular work or changes
in that
work [T333.15];  and that the scope of works was something which would
need to change as time went on [T335.10].
<P>

471   	Mr Niederberger under cross-examination in relation to
the letter J6, gave evidence that it was clear that the final break-up
of works
might vary from current scope [T373.25];  that it was clear from the letter
that design development would occur during the
TGMP to GMP phase [T376.5];
that it is clear from the letter that there would be design development after
the TGMP process was found
acceptable and agreed [T376.30];  that he understood
that paragraph 6 would be a term of the contract [T377.45];  that it was clear
to him that once Wards signed a contract, Wards would bear the risk of further
design development [T377.55];  that it was clear from
the letter that there
might be design development after the time of contract and that Wards would
bear the risk in respect of this
[T378.1];  that what the scope of works says
about risk is the same as his understanding of risks at all times [T379.15];
that the
draft subcontract is a blank subcontract [T379.40];  that the appendix
to the draft subcontract is totally blank and that he knew
this when he read it
[T379.55];  that the contract needed to be filled in [T380.15];  that there was
no clause in the draft contract
in relation to design risk;  that design risk
is included in the letter;  that he assumed the letter would be included in the
contract;
 that the person signing the contract would make sure it was included
[T380.30];  that design development could have been suggested
by Civil and
Civic [T386.10];  and that nothing in the letter J6 indicates that design
development is only something which Wards
did [T387.15].
<P>

472   	Wards' letter of 23 August 1993 [document J7], clearly
recognised the design risk exposure of Wards, and proposed contract
conditions
to share that risk.  Those conditions were never accepted by Civil and Civic.
No evidence was adduced suggesting that
Civil and Civic ever responded to the
proposal.  The enclosures to the letter under `Risk Profile' importantly
recognised that Wards
would be exposed to design risk `generally
<u>throughout</u> [the] project as original scope lacked detail which may
increase construction costs'.
<P>

473   	Under cross-examination in relation to the letter
document J7, Mr Ward gave evidence that he would need to take steps to
see
whether the terms it had proposed were accepted and incorporated in the final
contract [T31.40];  that before a final contract
was entered into, the tension
between the 3 August 1993 and 23 August 1993 letters would need to be resolved
[T33.20];  and that
it was clear to Mr Ward as at 23 August that the original
scope lacked detail and that there was a design risk to Wards generally
throughout the project which might increase construction costs [T37.15].
<P>

474   	Under cross-examination in relation to letter J7, Mr
Cherrie gave evidence that the design and scope were changing during
the TGMP
phase [T147.45] and that he could not say whether Civil and Civic agreed to any
of the contract conditions proposed by Wards
[T152.05].
<P>

475   	Mr Levido under cross-examination in relation to the
letter J7, gave evidence that there was no agreement with Civil and
Civic as to
the conditions referred to in the 23 August 1993 letter [T239.40];  and that it
was important for Wards to think about
the design risk that it was undertaking
in reaching a lump sum figure because if it got the exercise wrong, it could be
exposed to
significant loss [T243.45].
<P>

476   	Under cross-examination in relation to the letter J6, Mr
Niederberger gave evidence that he realised that there were differences
between
this letter and the 3 August letter and that these differences were never
resolved [T390.40].
<P>

477   	Wards' letter of 20 September 1993 [document J7A], does
not seem to add materially, being in generally the same form as document
J7.
Mr Levido gave evidence in relation to this letter that it was clear to
everybody who was working on the project that the scope
was changing from time
to time [T246.25].
<P>

478   	Wards' letter of 26 September 1993 [document J8] further
evidences Wards' knowledge and understanding of the phased procedure
then in
place, Wards describing the transition from TGMP to GMP as `the Price
Validation Period'.  The references to the potentially
large `windfall wins and
losses' in relation to design improvement, make plain that Wards were well and
truly aware that risks could
lead to losses.  In so far as the letter proposed
yet a different variant from Wards' previous proposals on design risk
allocation,
the proposal was never accepted nor apparently responded to.  The
attached table furnished detail of the design risk heads quantified
as
`contingency from TGMP'.
<P>

479   	Under cross-examination in relation to the letter
document J8, Mr Ward gave evidence that Wards' staff appreciated that there
was
an upside and a down side to the design development process [T47.05];  that the
letter shows that design was a risk to Wards
[T49.15];  and that Wards had to
review and accept the project programme prior to agreeing the final GMP
[T103.50].
<P>

480   	Mr Cherrie under cross-examination in relation to
document J8, gave evidence that the process of design development might
result
in benefit or detriment to Wards [T175.25];  and that design development might
result in a blow out of costs which would expose
Wards to an uneconomic lump
sum contract [T176.15].
<P>

481   	Mr Levido under cross-examination in relation to the
letter J8, gave evidence that it was his understanding and to his observation
the understanding of others within Wards, that one of the last things Wards
would have to do prior to signing off on a contract was
to look at the
programme current at the time and to make sure that it was acceptable to Wards
[T247.50];  that design development
could lead to design change [T248.30];
that he was never told that design would be complete by the time of contract
but his view
was that it would be near complete [T249.05];  that it was Wards'
intention that changes in scope brought about by amendments to
the design were
to be monitored [T249.30];  that the TGMP to GMP conversion might result in
potentially large wins and losses [T250.10];
 and that it was abundantly clear
that whatever the final contract was going to do, it had to deal with matters
of additional contractual
agreement that had been suggested by Wards
[T251.10].
<P>

482   	Mr Niederberger under cross-examination in relation to
the letter J8, gave evidence that there might be a risk to Wards in
the order
of $200,000 in relation to the project programme [T404.10];  and that the last
page under the heading `Design Risk' indicated
possible design overruns for
Wards and that those were not things suggested by Wards [T405.20].
<P>

483   	Outside of the question of whether or not Mr Cherrie
attended the 22 October 1993 design meeting, two at least of the records
of
that meeting [J8A and J8B], as both Mr Cherrie and Mr Niederberger conceded,
appeared to cover many of the same issues.  J8A includes
the words `design
development risk to stay with us' (meaning Wards).  Document J8B importantly
include:
<P>

<i>`WCE to take on design development.  Therefore no variations unless Civil
and Civic gets a variation (i.e. need to use the pot of
money made at
start).'</i>
<P>

484   	This last note is particularly important as it brings
into the parties' discussions the term `variations', plainly meaning
to refer
to the usual variations clause to be found in lump sum building contracts.
<P>

485   	The third record probably misdated 21 October [J8C] in Mr
Glasgow's handwriting, uses words similar in purport - `Wards will
be
responsible for design development risk - unless Prospect Water can get
variation from client'.
<P>

486   	Under cross-examination in relation to Mr Levido's note,
document J8A, Mr Cherrie gave evidence that Mr Levido's note was
consistent
with paragraph 6 of the 3 August letter [T157.55].  Mr Levido also gave
evidence that Greg Robinson had said that design
development risk was to remain
with Wards after the contract and that the note correctly summarised Mr
Levido's understanding at
the time [T254.55].  Mr Niederberger gave evidence
that he agreed with Mr Levido's notes that design development risk was to
remain
with Wards [T407.5].
<P>

487   	Under cross-examination in relation to Mr Niederberger's
handwritten notes, document 8B, Mr Cherrie gave evidence that Mr
Niederberger's
note was very closely the same as what was in the 3 August letter [T158.15];
that Mr Niederberger's note correctly
set out Mr Levido's understanding that
design development risk lay with Wards after contract and that there would be
no variations
unless Civil and Civic got a variation.  [T258.25]
<P>

488   	Under cross-examination in relation to Mr Glasgow's
handwritten notes, document J8C, Mr Cherrie gave evidence that Mr Glasgow's
note was the same concept that those at Wards had taken from the 3 August
letter and that Mr Glasgow's perception of Wards' risk
was one which he had as
at October 1993.  [T162.30]  Mr Niederberger gave evidence in relation to
document J8C that he agreed that
Mr Glasgow's notes that Wards were responsible
for design development risk unless there was a variation from client, expressed
his
understanding at the time [T407.40];  and that this appeared to be a
sentiment well known to people at Wards at the time [T407.45].
<P>

489   	Wards' letter of 17 November 1993 [document J9], was
closely cross-examined on.  The cross-examination raises the question
of what
the parties understood by use of the words `define scope' in the third
paragraph.
<P>

490   	Mr Ward's evidence in relation to the letter J9, was that
the 3 August letter continued to have relevance as at 17 November
1993
[T41.30];  that the TGMP was the starting point for a process that would lead
to a submission which may or may not result in
there being a GMP which Civil
and Civic found acceptable - that there may or may not be a contract entered
into between the parties
based upon the GMP [T41.55];  that as at 17 November
1993, there was to be a final contract in the future in addition to the
correspondence
up to that time;  that after 17 November there was to be a
period of an exchange of views about design development leading up to
that
contract;  that Civil and Civic may or may not enter into a contract with Wards
at the end of the period;  and that nothing
was promised to Wards by this time
about Civil and Civic entering into any arrangement for the construction of
anything [T44.10];
 that one cannot have design development without change
[T45.05];  that Wards and Civil and Civic were looking forward to the
preparation
of a final contract and did not think that 17 November 1993 was the
end of the process for a final contract [T50.15];  that the 17
November 1993
letter did not conclude a contractual arrangement [T53.45];  and that <u>he
accepted that anyone who reviewed on more than an absolutely cursory basis the
chain of letters from 3 August to 17 November would
have been alerted to the
necessity to look at the formal contract to see how those matters were
resolved</u>.  [T61.10]
<P>

491   	Mr Cherrie's evidence under cross-examination in relation
to document J9A was that as at 17 November, both parties were well
aware that
there was to come into existence a formal contract which would pull together
the various matters discussed and that it
was not until and unless that
contract was signed, that Wards and Civil and Civic could be taken to have
agreed to do the work set
out in drawings <u>current at that time</u>
[T153.30];  that the letter was the start of the process for moving from TGMP
to GMP [T168.30];  that the reference in the letter
to the costs of design
development was the concept which the parties had in mind as expressed in the 3
August letter [T168.50]; 
and that a further process of design development was
being looked forward to as at 17 November [T170.55].
<P>

492   	Mr Levido's evidence under cross-examination in relation
to the letter J9, was that by the time he left the project, the
blank standard
form subcontract had not been filled in any way [T259.05].
<P>

493   	Mr Pittolo's evidence in relation to the document J9, was
that at the end of the TGMP to GMP phase, there may not be a contract
between
the parties;  that there was to be <u>a continuing process of design
development leading up to the contract</u> [T278.05];  <u>that there was a
continuing process of revision of drawings and that Wards knew that what it had
to build was in the current drawings
not what was in some drawings from
previous years</u> [T278.50];  and that the Bill of Quantities did not say
anything about who bore the risk in respect of particular work or change
in
that work [T333.5].
<P>

494   	Mr Niederberger's evidence under cross-examination in
relation to J9, was that there had to be further design development
before the
TGMP was converted into a lump sum [T408.40].
<P>

495   	The `early works package' letter of intent of 6 December
1993 from Civil and Civic [document J10], referenced Civil and Civic's
invitation to provide a TGMP of 29 July 1993 - being document J5.  It stated
that `a Formal Subcontract Agreement is being prepared'
and that the letter of
intent was `subject to the execution by both parties of the said Agreement'.
The letter of intent dealing
with early works was simply a pre-cursor to a
contractual process.
<P>

496   	The December 1993 purchase order number 210311, document
J11, does not seem to me to add any matter of special significance
to the
issues.
<P>

497   	The plus/minus register dated January 1994, document
J11A, being the first such register, has a particular relevance both
in
relation to the purpose for which the register was being prepared and updated
and because, for example in relation to the column
headed `Action', one there
finds reference to `potential for additional works <u>not in current
scope'</u>.  Mr Pittolo's evidence under cross-examination was that he
understood that when Wards signed the contract, Wards would bear the
risk for
design development [T263.1];  and that he accepted that it did not require much
thought to understand that as Wards was
to bear the risk of design development
when it signed the contract, it had become very important for Wards to go to
design meetings
and to understand what was happening to the design that they
were going to have to construct [T263.10].
<P>

498   	The 7 February 1994 early works contract [document J12],
has already been referred to.  Under cross-examination in relation
to this
document, Mr Ward accepted that any officer of Wards could have read the early
works contract had they wanted to [T60.20];
 that it was clear from the
correspondence that people who wrote the correspondence would have to assume
that there was something
to be done by way of agreement before contractual
terms were incorporated [T60.55];  and that <u>clauses 6.10 and 6.30 of the
early works subcontract are consistent with the correspondence from June 1992
up to the time of the contract</u> [T63.35].
<P>

499   	Under cross-examination in relation to the early works
subcontract, Mr Cherrie gave evidence that the design development
process was
still continuing as at 7 February [T188.55];  that the lists of drawings and
specifications from August 1993 had been
well and truly superseded by February
1994 - and that to the extent that the February contract involved works, there
would inevitably
have been changes to the drawings involving those works
between June 1992, August 1993 and February 1994 [T189.05];  that it was
quite
plain that the terms of the standard form subcontract that had been exchanged
early on in dealings with the parties, would
not have been appropriate to sign
in that form by February or by May - and that a large number of things had to
change in the contract
[T191.55];  and that clause 6.10 and 6.30 <u>expressed
in formal words the concept of the comparison between design development and
variation, that competition having been well
known to exist to Wards back in
1993 and all the way through the process of design development - and that all
this contract did was
to put into formal words that concept</u> [T192.40].
<P>

500   	Mr Pittolo under cross-examination in relation to the
early works subcontract, gave evidence that as at 7 February there
were still
matters yet to be resolved to be incorporated into the final contract
[T283.35];  that when the final contract came around,
it was important to look
at what was comprehended in it [T285.45] and that the Manion `contract
conditions' document contained extracts
from the 7 February 1994 contract
[T359.55].
<P>

501   	As to the minutes of the monthly project review meeting
number one dated 15 March 1994, document J13, Mr Ward gave evidence
that it was
clear to everyone at the meeting that there was still a contract in the future
and that it was to be resolved for the
end of March;  that nobody thought there
was already a contract at the end of 17 November 1994 and that everybody
thought there was
going to be a contract and it was coming up [T66.50].
<P>

502   	Under cross-examination in relation to the minutes of the
15 March 1994 meeting, Mr Cherrie gave evidence that during this
time, he was
aware that there was to be a contract resolved at some time [T180.10].
<P>

503   	Under cross-examination in relation to the annotated
schedules of substantial completion, document J15, Mr Ward gave evidence
that
it was clear that a member of the Wards staff appreciated the day before the
May 1994 contract was signed, that the dates in
the schedule were to go into
the contract [T102.05].
<P>

504   	Mr Cherrie in relation to document J15, gave evidence
that he was aware that the schedule of substantial completion was being
discussed and drawn up on the Tuesday prior to the signing of the contract
[T201.40].
<P>

505   	Mr Pittolo gave evidence that he saw the schedule of
substantial completion on 17 May and knew that the matter was being
raised for
the purposes of incorporation into the 18 May contract - it was a new document
which he had not seen before [T317-35];
 that he was clear that what Mr
Niederberger and Mr O'Connell were doing in agreeing the schedule of
substantial completion, was
finalising the document for the purpose of
inclusion in the contract [T339.50].
<P>

506   	Mr Niederberger under cross-examination in relation to
document J15, gave evidence that he agreed that the dates in his handwriting
at
the bottom of the schedule of substantial completion were agreed with Mr
O'Connell to be included in the contract [T413.30]; 
that he referred to the
programme he was preparing to come up with the dates in the schedule [T413.40];
and that when he checked,
the contract dates were correctly recorded by Mr
O'Connell in the contract [T414.25].
<P>

507   	Document J15A is the last plus/minus register of 14 May
1994 prepared four days prior to the Subcontract being signed.  Mr
Cherrie
under cross-examination in relation to this register, gave evidence that the
register contained both positives and negatives
and considered both the effect
which could be assessed contractually at the time and also looking forward to
future potential effects
[T181.30];  that the plus/minus register tracked
things different to what was on the variation summary [T182.20];  and that he
understood
as at 18 May that Wards was still under the same risk as that
described in the 3 August letter [T184.55].
<P>

508   	The monthly project review meeting number three held on
16 May 1994, two days prior to the Subcontract being signed, has
already been
referred to.  Mr Ward gave evidence in relation to this meeting that it was
clear to everyone at the meeting that the
contract was to be resolved for
signing by Wards on 18 May [T76.35];  that the minutes of the meeting recorded
mutual satisfaction
of the plus/minus register and that there was no document
or conversation recorded disagreeing with the minute [T77.45];  that it
is
quite possible that the reason that the reference to the plus/minus register
and the minutes changes after 16 May, is that from
the time of contract
onwards, design development risk was to be borne by Wards [T79.15];  that there
are many items on the plus/minus
register which do not stem from design
development suggested by Wards [T79.25];  and that design development
inevitably involves
design change [T79.50].
<P>

509   	Mr Cherrie's further evidence was that the May 1994
contract was to be the final subcontract [T193.30].
<P>

510   	In relation to the minutes of site meeting number
seventeen of 16 May 1994 [document J17], Mr Ward's evidence was that the
minutes meant that Wards was in front on the plus/minus register at that stage
relative to the lump sum which was just about to be
incorporated into a
contract [T82.45].
<P>

511   	Mr Cherrie's evidence in relation to these minutes was
that had Wards assessed the plus/minus register and found itself to
be well
behind, Wards might consider asking for a higher lump sum price even at that
late date [T198.35].
<P>

512   	Mr Niederberger's evidence in relation to the 16 May 1994
site meeting minutes was that he had to finalise the overall construction
programme with Civil and Civic by 17 May because of the signing of the contract
on 18 May [T413.5] and that he accepted that Mr Cherrie
had said that the
plus/minus register was ahead as at 16 May 1994 [T413.15].
<P>

513   	Turning then to the 18 May 1994 subcontract, document
J18, Mr Ward's evidence was that he did not think as at May 1994 that
they were
agreeing to construct the project as defined by the list of drawings in the 3
August 1993 letter - and that <u>Wards knew that what they had to build was
what was on the drawings as at May 1994</u> [T98.55].
<P>

514   	Mr Cherrie's evidence under cross-examination in relation
to the 18 May subcontract included that the list of drawings in
the contract
continued to be developed and changed <u>right up until the contract was
signed</u> [T131.10];  <u>that there was no doubt that there were two competing
concepts, namely a variation claim and design development risk [T132.15];  that
clauses 6.10 and 6.30 accurately reproduced the competition between design and
development risk and variations and that was a competition
which had been
understood throughout the time he was involved in the project</u> [T198.55];
that the list of documents to be included in the contract had to be the list of
documents as updated as at 18 May;  that
there would have been no point in
annexing a list current in June 1992 or August 1993 or any other particular
time other than 18
May;  that the schedule of substantial completion reflected
negotiations up to and including that day [T200.30];  that he believed
the 18
May contract was a summary of the agreements which had been reached at that
point in time [T200.50];  and that the May 1994
contract was to reflect
discussions up to and including 18 May [T206.10].
<P>

515   	Mr Pittolo under cross-examination in relation to the
subcontract, gave evidence that he believed that all matters in that
document
were discussed between January and May [T291.25];  that he believed there was
an agreement on everything as of 18 May [T291.55];
 that he understood that
design development risk remained with Wards [T292.55];  <u>that Wards knew it
signed up to build what was in the revised drawings on 18 May [T325.45];  that
it was obvious that the scope of
works provided by Mr O'Connell in 1994 had to
be different to the 3 August 1993 Scope of Works </u>[T329.45];  that the scope
of works talked about sort of work in general terms which is to be done and the
sort of risks each party
bore in respect of that work [T331.55];  <u>that the
Scope of Works provided by Mr O'Connell in 1994 had to be an update of the
Scope of Works in the 3 August letter</u> [T332.5];  that the scope of works
said who bears the risk in respect of particular work or changes in that work
[T333.15];  that
<u>the scope of works was something which would need to change
as time went on</u> [T335.10];  that he was not surprised that the scope of
works contained allocation of design development risk to Wards [T336.40];
 that
Mr Pittolo already knew that there were many areas where design details were
still required [T347.35];  and that Mr Pittolo's
interest at the time of
copying extracts of the contract would have been in the appendix [T354.50].
<P>

516   	Mr Niederberger's evidence in relation to the subcontract
was that the list of drawings needed to be updated to be incorporated
into the
contract [T381.40];  that he had to finalise the overall construction programme
with Civil and Civic by 17 May 1994 because
of the signing of the contract on
18 May 1994 [T413.5] and that he accepted that Mr Cherrie had said that the
plus/minus register
showed that Wards was ahead as at 16 May 1994 [T413.15].
<P>

517   	As to the letter from Wards to Hornicks of 23 May 1994,
Mr Pittolo's evidence was that he was personally involved in the
Subcontract
with Hornicks [T341.10].
<P>

518   	In relation to the letter from Mr Aldis to Pittolo of 20
June 1994, Document J18A, Mr Ward gave evidence under cross-examination
that
the letter reflected that Mr Aldis had the same understanding of design
development risk and the same small exception to that
risk as had existed in
the documents since June 1992 [T86.45].  Mr Cherrie, under cross-examination in
relation to the same document,
gave evidence that the letter reflected the
understanding which persisted at Wards up to and after June 1994 of the design
development
risk which was consistent with the 3 August letter [T209.40].  Mr
Pittolo under cross-examination in relation to the same letter,
gave evidence
that he already knew that there were many areas where design details were still
required [T347.35].
<P>

519   	As to the letter from Mr Aldis to Mr Cherrie of 5 July
1994, Document J20, Mr Ward's evidence was that the Aldis letters
recorded
exactly the same risk in relation to design development that Wards had been
informed of by correspondence commencing in
June 1992 [T88.40];  that design
development risk included cost associated with ramifications of design
development [T91.10];  and
that there was nothing in the 3 August 1993 letter
or any other letter which restricted Wards' risk on design development to
development
suggested by Wards [T91.55].  Mr Cherrie, under cross-examination
in relation to this letter, gave evidence that the letter was consistent
with
the 3 August letter and did not come as a surprise.  [T210.15]  Mr Pittolo's
evidence under cross-examination in relation to
the letter, was that the letter
was in similar terms to the 20 June 1994 letter [T351.25].
<P>

520   	As to the 17 June 1994 Hornicks Subcontract, Document
J21, Mr Cherrie's evidence was that the changes to clause 6.30 could
not have
been left to a general assistant [T217.20].  Mr Pittolo's evidence under
cross-examination in relation to the Subcontract,
was that he was responsible
for preparation of the Subcontract [T342.5];  that it was not a simple exercise
of changing all `Wards'
references to `Hornicks' [T342.30];  that he added the
definition of `main contract' and other non-standard changes [T343.5];  that
after the standard changes of `C&amp;C' to `WCE' were made, he scanned the
contract and saw that the changes made in clause 6.30.2
and other clauses did
not make sense so that he changed `WCE' to `client' [T344.10];  and that
clauses 6.10 and 6.30 were no different
to the understanding Mr Pittolo always
had in relation to design development and variations [T344.35].
<P>

<b>Findings as to whether Wards knowingly accepted the risk of further design
development after 18 May 1994</b>
<P>

521   	To my mind, the evidence adduced under cross-examination
from the plaintiff's witnesses is unequivocal in establishing that
Wards knew
that as at 18 May 1994, it was accepting the risk for further `within scope'
design development, even though it may not
have specifically turned its mind to
the particular wording of clause 6.30 in the subcontract or have had its
attention drawn to
the wording of that specific clause.  In my view on the
evidence, the plaintiff at all times undertook the risk for design development
and knew that it would undertake any further risk for design development,
<u>providing such development was within scope</u>, after execution of the
formal written subcontract which, on the evidence, it also knew was necessary
to record its acceptance of
the GMP of $16.7million.
<P>

522   	On the whole of the evidence, it seems to me that there
can be no doubt that the plaintiff's own witnesses were in complete
agreement
with the defendant's witnesses in terms of the parties' mutual understanding as
to Wards' risk for further `within scope'
design development after the GMP
subcontract of 18 May 1994 was signed.
<P>

523   	It is as well to recall that Mr Walker in opening the
case, defined the basic issue in these terms:
<P>

<i>`6.30 is on any view material, critical, crucial and important and the
defendant's answer to our claim must ultimately be, they cannot
do less than
this to succeed, that it must ultimately be either to show that we did know
that 6.30 was in it when it was signed,
there are traces of that in the
overview of submissions, but it will depend upon the cross-examination of
witnesses, particularly
Mr Cherrie.  If they fail in that which is at the most
fundamental subjective psychological level of fact, if they fail on that,
then
they might have cause to revert to L'Estrange v F. Graucob Limited (1934) 2KB
394, whether you knew it [was] in or not, and
accepted you did not know it, you
are to be taken as having agreed to it because it was in a document signed.'
</i>[Transcript day 1 pages 28.2-28.3]
<P>

524   	In opening the case, Mr Walker SC stated that the
plaintiff's claim for relief on the several juristic bases identified in
the
summons derived from, inter alia:
<P>

<i>`. . . the failure on or about 18 May 1994 of the defendant to point out
what we will characterise as the radical departure from the
negotiating
expectations set out by all the documents beforehand . . .'</i>   [T16.3]
<P>

525   	At the end of the day, and if the proper construction of
clause 6.30.1 is to limit Wards disentitlement to receive payments
to that
category of design development variations as involves `within scope' variations
[the construction issue is dealt with below],
the evidence did not establish
anything remotely like a radical departure from the negotiating expectations
set out by the earlier
documents, nor that Civil and Civic by its officers or
employees had failed during the negotiations to make plain in clear and precise
terms, what the negotiations were intended to lead to.
<P>

526   	During his opening, Mr Walker SC contended that although
the GMP of $16.7million remained as the TGMP of $16.7million, the
allocation of
risk imparted by clause 6.30 changed the commercial outcome of the process
which the parties had undertaken since 17
November 1993 [T33.10-34.2].  Mr
Walker SC, further asserted:
<P>

<i>`. . . nothing my learned friend will be able to persuade your Honour of
will be able to show 6.30 in the dealings between the parties.
 He will not in
our respectful submission be able to say that someone using requisite care for
their own interest would have described
between the lines of the documents up
to 17 November 1993 everything that 6.30 is now intended by Civil and Civic to
work to the
detriment of my client.'  [T34.3-34.4]</i>
<P>

527   	I accept that there can be no doubt on the plaintiff's
own evidence that the relevant personnel of the plaintiff company
knew the
concept and fact of risk for further `within scope' design development embodied
by clause 6.30, that having been a matter
which was discussed between the
parties prior to 18 May 1994 and anticipated by the plaintiff to be embodied in
a formal subcontract
document.  What was not anticipated was the concept or
fact of risk for further `without scope' design development, if that risk
be,
as a matter of construction, embodied within clause 6.30.
<P>

528   	It is inappropriate to repeat yet again large segments of
the evidence given by the plaintiff's witnesses on the topic of
whether Wards
knowingly accepted the risk of further `within scope' design development after
18 May 1994.  Shortly, however, the
totality of Mr Ward's evidence is to the
effect that the design development clause at 6.30 of the 7 February and 18 May
1994 subcontracts
were consistent with the obligations of Wards and the
exposure of Wards for design development matters which was the subject of
correspondence
starting back in June 1992 and later expressed in the letter
dated 3 August 1993.  [See for example T63.36-.44;  T39.41-.57;  T20.52-.58;
T20.33-.34;  T56.18-.23].  Mr Ward, inter alia, expressed no doubt that the
risk for further design development as a concept was
a matter which was to be
part of the contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant,
whether expressed in the terms
of clause 6.30 or in the terms of paragraph 6 of
the letter of 3 August.
<P>

529   	Mr Cherrie's evidence was generally to the same effect.
He was, for example, taken to clause 6.10.3 and clause 6.30 of the
7 February
and 18 May 1994 subcontracts and was asked and answered as follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Can I suggest to you that these two clauses, without going into all the
legalism, expressed in formal words the same concept that
we are talking about
before the break, the competition that there was between design development and
variation?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And that that is a competition which was well known to exist to Wards
back in 1993 and all the way through to the process of design
development that
we talked about this morning?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes I agree.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And that all this contract did was put into formal words that concept,
that competition?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I believe so.'   </i>[T192.39-.55;  T198.45-T199.3]
<P>

530   	Mr Cherrie acknowledged that `to properly reflect the
terms of the arrangement between the parties, such a term would have
to be put
in in [sic] some future development of this document [the letter of 3 August
1993]' - T143.
<P>

531   	Mr Levido's evidence was not materially different.  He
stated, inter alia, that he would have ensured that the effect of
`paragraphs 5
and 6 of the letter of 3 August got translated into some more acceptable
contractual language in the document, the
subcontract itself'.
[T236.33-.38]
<P>

532   	Mr Pittolo's evidence was also not materially different.
It was, however, slightly confused at times.  He `understood that
when Wards
signed the contract they would bear the risk for design development'.  [T263]
He shortly thereafter gave the following
evidence:
<P>

<i>`Q.	You understood that one of the risks that Wards took in signing up to a
lump sum contract was the risk of whatever it might cost
unexpected by them, to
complete the project according to whatever design development was necessary to
finalise the design?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, that is not what I understood.'   </i>[T267.38]
<P>

533   	This change in Mr Pittolo's evidence is inexplicable.  He
did appear to give inconsistent answers.
<P>

534   	Mr Pittolo gave evidence initially to the following
effect:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And as you have said earlier, in your view GMP is in a sense synonymous
with signing the lump sum contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	that's what the process of agreeing the GMP is, that's the outcome
agreeing the GMP?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.'  [T282]</i>
<P>

535   	On being shown the design procurement programme,
accompanying the minutes of design meeting number 20 on 6 April 1994, Mr
Pittolo agreed that the representation of the process of design development
extended beyond the anticipated time for signature of
the GMP contract.
[T310]
<P>

536   	Yet Mr Pittolo found it necessary to later contend that
the GMP process was not actually finalised as at 18 May 1994 when
the
subcontract was signed.  [T323]  And as at 18 May 1994 `Wards had not agreed to
a GMP'.  [T320]
<P>

537   	Mr Pittolo sought to introduce a limitation on that area
for which he had admitted Wards were responsible for design development.
 Mr
Pittolo said:  `We were only responsible for design development, I believe, of
our works'  [T268.40].
<P>

538   	Mr Pittolo then acknowledged that his `understanding was
derived from conversations with Wards'.  [T269.20]  He identified
the source of
his belief as conversations with Mr Manion and Mr Cherrie [T268.48].
<P>

539   	No document has ever been identified nor was the
plaintiff's evidence ever to the effect, that Civil and Civic led any Wards
representative to have that belief or understanding.
<P>

540   	In fact, Mr Pittolo also gave the following evidence:
<P>

<i>`Q.	One thing though did not need to be looked at for the purposes of
understanding what was happening, and that was whatever clause
said Wards bears
design risk for design development up to contract, because he knew that
perfectly well for months before?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	We knew that, and we accepted that we bore that risk, yes.'
</i>[T285.57-T286.5]
<P>

541   	In case there was any mistake, the evidence quoted above
confirmed other evidence of Mr Pittolo that `Wards understood that
Civil and
Civic required that Wards undertake the risk of design development'
[T273.36].
<P>

542   	Evidence of the same effect was repeated at T290.19:
<P>

<i>`Q.	One thing you had understood although there might be disagreements about
what was included in this term was that you knew after
the contract [Wards] was
going to be at risk for design development?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.'</i>
<P>

543   	And again:
<P>

<i>`Q.	You understood before contract and after the contract that design
development risk, whatever each side would argue design development,
remained
with Wards?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q,.	That we can discount as part of any confusion arising out of the
contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.' </i> T292.57-293.7]
<P>

544   	Mr Pittolo then retracted the evidence referred to at 282
of the transcript, commencing at line 5:
<P>

<i>`A.	That was never put to us that when we signed the contract we agreed the
GMP.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	The whole basis of Wards' involvement in this process was one which
commenced in a letter which talked about a process of moving
from a TGMP to a
GMP, wasn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You understood very well that if and when the TGMP was agreed, a contract
might be signed?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you understood that until a GMP was agreed, there could be no
possibility of a contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That's what C&amp;C told you?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Well sorry - well no, C&amp;C didn't tell me that.  What you were saying
is common sense.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you understood that common sense?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	The way its now put to me now, yes.'   </i>[T324-325]
<P>

545   	Notwithstanding Mr Pittolo's confused evidence at times,
several things remain clear:
<P>

`(i)	He understood that risk for design development after contract was with
Wards;
<P>

(ii)	The source of his apparent understanding that Wards' exposure to the risk
for design development was limited to design improvements
initiated by Wards,
was based solely on discussions with Mr Cherrie and Mr Manion and could not be
identified from any document nor
any statement made to him by Civil and
Civic.
<P>

546   	Mr Niederberger consistently with the evidence given of
each of the other witnesses called by the plaintiff, gave evidence
that the
effect of paragraph 6 of the 3 August 1993 letter, was consistent with his
understanding.  [See T377.46-T378.10]:
<P>

<i>`A.	I didn't realise that that [paragraph 6 of the 3 August letter] would be
incorporated as a term, but it would be an understanding,
yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It reflected your understanding?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	At all times the nature of the risk borne by Wards?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And it was clear then to you, that once Wards signed a contract for a
lump sum with Civil and Civic, Wards bear the risk of further
design
development?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And I'll take you back to a question and answer I asked you about a
little earlier.  It was quite plain from reading this that
it was expected that
there might be design development after the time of contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And that if there was Wards would bear the risk in respect of the design
development?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.'</i>   [T377.46-378.10]
<P>

547   	The evidence of certain of the plaintiff's witnesses who
were not called but which can be ascertained from objective documentary
evidence also, it seems to me, confirms an understanding by several key Wards'
key personnel to the effect that Wards accepted and
understood the risk of
further `within scope' design development after execution of a GMP lump sum
contract.  I refer in this regard
to Mr Glasgow and to the 1 July 1992
document, questioning how design development would be differentiated from
variations.  I refer
also to Mr Manion who had signed a letter to Hornicks of
23 November 1993 which had stated in part:
<P>

<i>`The works priced by yourselves [i.e. Hornicks] has been included in our
work area scope.   This procurement strategy also involves
the establishment of
target guaranteed maximum prices.  These are lump sum amounts set on the basis
of Civil and Civic's budget and
agreed with the respective contractors prior to
the commencement of the design development process.  Once set the parties shall
then
engage in the design development so that after a period of eight weeks the
target price can subject to the contractors agreement
be converted into a lump
sum contract of equal value.  This lump sum is to be inclusive of all costs
associated with variations arising
from design development, rise and fall, site
allowance.  A contract will be established between us based on our contract
with Civil
and Civic and will transmit its benefits and obligations . .
.'.</i>
<P>

548   	Mr Ward accepted, under cross-examination, that Mr Manion
`perceived that design development might involve what would otherwise
be
variation'.  [T56]
<P>

549   	Mr Aldis' letters have also been referred to.  They
confirm in the clearest terms Mr Aldis' understanding that whereas Wards
did
not have responsibility for design, it carried the risk of the cost of design
development.  After being referred to the correspondence
of Mr Aldis, Mr Ward
was asked:
<P>

<i>`Q.	And as plainly as can be, the correspondence since June 1992 said the
risk on design development was Wards after contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And the risk includes costs associated with ramifications of design
development?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.'   </i>[T91]
<P>

550   	In my view, again upon the assumption that clause 6.30
limits Wards disentitlement to receive payments to that category of
design
development variations as involves `within scope' variations, the evidence does
not support Wards' assertion that it was of
a mistaken belief or under any
misapprehension in terms of its obligations and risks at the time that the 18
May 1994 subcontract
was executed.  Upon the assumption referred to, the
evidence does not support Wards' assertion that clause 6.30 was incorporated
by
Civil and Civic without the knowledge or acceptance of the purport of that
clause by Civil and Civic.
<P>

<b>The proper construction of clause 6.30</b>
<P>

551   	It will be clear from what is stated above, that the
proper construction of clause 6.30 requires determination.
<P>

552   	I turn to that matter.
<P>

<b>The Respective Submissions</b>
<P>

553   	During final submissions, the proper construction of
clause 6.30.1(b) [and of clauses 6.30.1(a) and 6.10.3] in the May 1994
Subcontract received close attention.
<P>

<b>Wards Submissions</b>
<P>

554   	Mr Walker submitted that clause 6.30.1(b) was a provision
which recognised that matters which would otherwise constitute
variations
falling outside the scope of works might be directed to be completed by the
subcontractor without remuneration by dint
of claim that the same constituted
`design development variations'.  The submission (following some earlier
submissions made by Mr
Walker on day 9 at transcript 83.2 which were later in
part retracted or clarified), accepted as correct the proposition that a
variation
may in common practice be directed within the confine of a scope of
works.
<P>

555   	[See for example the AS2124-1992 form of General
Conditions of Contract, which provides in clause 40.1 - `Variations to the
work' - the contractor is bound only to execute a variation which is within the
general scope of the Contract . . . `;  and see also
clause 6.10 of the JCC
form of contract - `Variations' which provides:
<P>

<i>`Unless otherwise agreed all variations shall be within the general scope of
this Agreement so as to be of a character and extent
contemplated by and
capable of being executed under the applicable conditions of this
Agreement'.]</i>
<P>

556   	Mr Walker's contention was, however, that the wording of
clause 6.30.1(b), and in particular the use of the words `including
matters
which would otherwise constitute variations', seen together with clause 6.10.3
showed that the clause meant that variations
brought about by design
development <u>outside</u> the scope of works, were to be at the risk of Wards,
save to the extent that Civil and Civic received payment for such `design
development
variations' under the Head Contract.
<P>

557   	This construction of clause 6.30.1(b) was submitted as
falling well outside the matters the subject of paragraph 6 in the
3 August
1993 invitation to tender.
<P>

558   	The use of the word `Works' in clause 6.30.1(b) requires
close attention.  Civil and Civic rely upon the wording of paragraph
A of the
Subcontract which reads:
<P>

<i>`THE PARTIES AGREE</i>
<P>

<i>A.	The Contractor must execute and complete the whole of the works namely
all site preparation, earthworks, civil works, road works,
landscaping and
other works and as more particularly disclosed in the Scope of Works (including
variations under the Contract) (`Works')
in every respect to the satisfaction
of C&amp;C in accordance with the Contract.'</i>
<P>

<b>Civil and Civic's Submissions</b>
<P>

559   	Civil and Civic contend that "by virtue of this
`definition' of `Works' and the wording of clause 6.30.1(b), design development
<u>must only</u> be able to occur within the ambit of the scope of works which
constitute the `Works' as defined".
<P>

560   	I interpolate that a clear function of the agreement
expressed in clause A was to oblige Wards to carry out the Works `in
every
respect to the satisfaction of [Civil and Civic] and in accordance with the
Contract'.  Hence the definitional aspect of the
agreement is part only of a
clause dealing with another subject matter.  Whilst this does not affect the
fact that the clause includes
a definition, it may well explain why it is that
the words in parenthesis were used.  To my mind, clause A ought not be read as
an
agreement that the Scope of Works may be expanded by the direction of a
variation.
<P>

561   	Rather, clause A is included in order to oblige the
contractor to carry out `within scope' variations as directed - for which
work
the contractors entitlement to payment is usually covered by well understood
and usually similar contractual provisions dealing
with variations.
<P>

<b>Civil and Civic's Seven Contentions</b>
<P>

562   	The defendant, as I understood the case put by Mr Finch
SC, put the following seven contentions:
<P>

<u>Contention I </u>- The proper construction of Clause 6.30.1 was to read the
clause as if the words `within scope' had been included into subclause
(a).
<P>

[Such a reading would result in clauses 6.30.1 and 6.30.2 providing as
follows:
<P>

<i>`6.30.1	The Contractor acknowledges that:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the design of the Works is not finalised and further development of the
design </i><cite>within scope</cite><i> will be undertaken by C&amp;C;
and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the development of the design may result in changes to the Works
("Design Development Variations") including matters which would
otherwise
constitute variations.</i>
<P>

<i>6.30.2	Notwithstanding any other term of this Contract C&amp;C will not be
liable for any losses suffered by the Contractor in connection
with and no
adjustment will be made to the Contract sum in respect of any Design
Development Variation except to the extent that
C&amp;C receives payment for
the Design Development Variation under the Head Contract.']</i>
<P>

<u>Contention II</u> - The defendant did not and had never read clause 6.30 in
any other way, nor made [although the word `made' was used, I understood
the
concession to be that no such claim would be made in the future] any claim in
the proceedings on the basis that the clause should
be read in any other
way.
<P>

<u>Contention III</u> - This reading of clause 6.30 was entirely consistent
with the understanding of Messrs Robinson and O'Connell elicited under
cross-examination.
<P>

<u>Contention IV</u> - This reading of clause 6.30 expressed precisely the
intent exposed in paragraph 6 of the 3 August 1993 Civil and Civic letter.
<P>

<u>Contention V</u> - The only substantive extant dispute between the parties
was one which could not be solved by a reading of the clauses alone, namely,
where is the line to be drawn between a design development and a variation.
That question could only be answered in the context of
a particular item in
dispute - here to be the subject of the reference out.
<P>

<u>Contention VI</u> - The critical underlying <u>pleaded</u> issue dividing
the parties, was as to what was the Scope of Works which had been contractually
agreed to inter se;  the defendant's
contention being that the 12 April scope
to be found within the May Subcontract document was the scope agreed to and the
plaintiff's
contention being that the Scope of Works agreed upon was frozen as
at 17 November 1993.
<P>

<u>Contention VII</u> - The answer to the plaintiff's contention was that the
Scope of Works material provided up to 17 November 1993 was ex facie provided
as forming `the works for [the purpose of] pricing of a TGMP' [see PX volume 3
page 142 - part of the J6 3 August 1993 materials].
<P>

<b>Holding as to the proper construction</b>
<P>

563   	What then is the proper construction of the clauses?
<P>

564   	The word `works' appears in :
<P>

(a)	The clause 1.1 definition of variation:
<P>

	(i)	under subparagraph (a) and
<P>

	(ii)	under subparagraph (e)
<P>

(b)	Clause 6.30.1(a)
<P>

(c)	Clause 6.30.1(b)
<P>

565   	In so far as paragraph A of the agreement purports to
define `Works' as the Scope of Works (including variations under the
contract),
it is plain that the word `Works' is not always meant to be read as including
the words in parenthesis.  Subparagraph
(a) of the definition of variations
would be circular were this not so.  It would read:
<P>

`Variation' means . .<i> .</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	an increase or decrease in or omissions from the scope of works
(including variations . . .).'</i>
<P>

566   	Importantly, however, subparagraph (e) of the definition
of variations brings into play the concept of a change to the Scope
of Works -
which in my view is a reference to a direction dealing with matters which are
beyond scope.
<P>

567   	To my mind, the words in clause 6.30.1(b) `including
matters which would otherwise constitute variations', read in context,
refer to
the `without scope' variations of the type described in subparagraph (e) of the
definition of `variations'.  On this construction:
<P>

(i)	Clause 6.30.1 involves an acknowledgment by Wards that further development
of the design to be undertaken by Civil and Civic
may result in changes to the
works, including changes which would be beyond scope.
<P>

(ii)	Clause 6.30.2 then limits Wards' entitlement to payments for design
development variations, whether within or without scope,
to situations where
Civil and Civic receives payment for the design development variation under the
Head Contract.
<P>

<b>Conclusion in relation to Civil and Civic's Contentions I to V</b>
<P>

568   	Returning to Civil and Civic's above described seven
contentions:
<P>

Contention I is rejected.  The proper construction of the clause is as set out
above.
<P>

As to Contention II - there is no evidence to enable the Court to accept or
reject the contention insofar as it deals with the defendant's
past conduct.
Civil and Civic's concession as to the position presently and into the future
was clear as announced in final submissions.
<P>

As to Contention III - it is correct to say that the construction which Civil
and Civic seek to attribute to clause 6.30 was indeed
the understanding of
Messrs Robinson and O'Connell elicited under cross-examination.  That
construction is not however, as a matter
of law, the correct construction to be
given to the words in clause 6.30.
<P>

As to Contention IV - the contention is accepted.
<P>

As to Contention V - the contention is accepted.
<P>

As to Contentions (VI) and (VII), it is necessary to return to the evidence in
some detail.
<P>

<b>Was there an agreed scope of works as at 17 November 1993 pursuant to which
the parties had agreed for Wards to perform the works?</b>
<P>

569   	Turning then to the scope of works issues and to question
5(a) of the questions for separate determination, that question
attempts to
have the scope of works which were to be performed under the subcontract,
redefined by reference to the priced bill of
quantities dated 19 November 1993
(accompanying the TGMP acceptance letter of 17 November 1993, together with the
scope of works
document dated 12 July 1993 and the drawings referred to in the
defendant's TGMP letter of invitation dated 3 August 1993).  The
final approach
to the issue is reflected in paragraphs 5 and 6 of Wards written submissions of
1 July 1999.  These formulations plainly
enough ignore the other documents
relied upon by Wards as constituting the alleged 1993 agreement which clearly
state the intention
to amend the 12 July 1993 scope of works document.  (See,
for example, the minutes of each of the meetings referred to in paragraph
(g)
to the particulars to paragraph 2 of the summons which reads `The base scope of
works issued with the TGMP documents is to be
enhanced by the following
notes').
<P>

570   	It will be apparent from what follows that I accept as
correct, a number of Civil and Civic's written submissions on this
issue.
<P>

571   	The only witnesses on behalf of Wards to give evidence in
support of that part of Wards' case were Mr Pittolo and Mr Niederberger.
 Wards
witnesses generally conveyed an understanding in their witness statements to
the effect that it was their belief that as at
17 November 1993 or about
December 1993, Wards and Civil and Civic had an agreement for the performance
by Wards of the Works as
defined in the Summons.  The evidence under
cross-examination of each of Wards' witnesses establish the falsity of that
proposition
and suggests against any objective or subjective foundation for
that contention.  On the evidence, there was no agreement for the
construction
of the works as at November or December 1993 and therefore no construction work
thereafter could be based on a scope
as of that date.  Nonetheless, Messrs
Pittolo and Niederberger have asserted that the scope of works identified in
the bill of quantities
accompanying the letter of 17 November 1993 defines the
scope of works which the parties had agreed upon as at that date. This evidence
is inconsistent with the relief sought by Wards as it ignores the other
documents referred to above namely the Scope of Works document
dated 12 July
1993 and the drawings referred to in Civil and Civic TGMP letter of invitation
dated 3 August 1993.
<P>

572   	I accept that in one sense, the bill of quantities does
achieve a purpose. Its purpose as at November 1993 is solely for
pricing the
TGMP.
<P>

573   	However, the bill of quantities document does not, on its
own, define the scope of works agreed as at November 1993 or thereabouts.
The
Summons and Question 5(a) of the Questions for Separate Determination and the
Plaintiff's 1 July 1999 written submissions make
it clear what comprises the
scope of works now contended by Wards.
<P>

574   	The evidence of Messrs Pittolo and Niederberger is not, I
accept,  to that effect.
<P>

<b>The Evidence of Mr Pittolo and Mr Niederberger</b>
<P>

575   	Mr Pittolo referred to "the scope" as "only one document
setting up the scope of works which was [the 17 November TGMP schedule]"
(TP266
L38-L45).
<P>

576   	Similarly, Mr Niederberger gave evidence that "... it was
the bill of quantities that had the scope that had been agreed
prior to my
being involved in the job. That was my understanding" (TP374 L12-L14).
<P>

577   	He further stated:
<P>

<i>"The bill of quantities merely described the scope that Wards priced."
(TP388 L54-L55).</i>
<P>

578   	Mr Niederberger readily conceded that a scope of works
document is a very different document to a bill of quantities (for
example
TP374 L16-L18; L55-L57).
<P>

579   	Mr Pittolo also conceded that a scope of works document
is "a very different sort of document to a bill of quantities" (TP331
L49 to
L52). As Mr Pittolo acknowledged:
<P>

<i>"Q.	One thing you knew must go in though, inevitably, was an updated list of
drawings.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	If the contract required for it, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	But in any event, one thing you did know was that drawings had been
revised and issued as revised drawings since November 1993.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And it was quite clear to everybody that what had to be constructed is
what was described in the revised documents.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes." (TP318 L11 to L23)</i>
<P>

580   	It may well be that the TGMP agreed sum of $16.7 million
can be referenced to the bill of quantities of 19 November 1993.
 I accept,
however, that that bill of quantities is nothing more than a document prepared
by Wards which provides its allocation
of prices against items of work which
are derived from other critical documents, namely the specification, drawings
and Scope of
Works document itself. The arbitrary nature of the bill of
quantities for the purposes of agreeing the TGMP price is, I accept,
illustrated
by reference to items 28.1 and 28.2 of the bill of quantities (at
page 28) and the evidence of Mr Cherrie that the mechanism for
reducing the
TGMP sum of $17.34 million to $16.7 million was simply a matter of deducting
$640,000 and to allocate that sum to "two
items ... tacked on at the end to
achieve the deduction" (TP166 L21-L23). 
<P>

581   	I further accept Civil and Civic's submission that the
flaw in Ward's case seeking rectification of the Subcontract to include
the
Scope of Works of 12 July 1993, the drawings accompanying the letter of 3
August 1993 and the bill of quantities of 19 November
1993, is that Wards'
witnesses on this aspect of its case emphasised the bill of quantities as being
the document defining the scope
as at 17 November 1993.  But as at 18 May 1994,
when the Subcontract was executed, the specification and the drawings
identified
in the letter of 3 August 1993 and the Scope of Works of 12 July
1993 had all been revised and it is those documents which Wards,
on the
evidence, were to use, for the purpose of performing its works.
<P>

582   	Mr Pittolo agreed that from the nature of his involvement
in the project, he needed a "general idea of actual terms of the
subcontract".
(TP265 L52 to L53). Mr Pittolo acknowledged that "changes ... might be needed
to the scope of works as a result of
what was being described in these
drawings". (TP266 L5 to L8). 
<P>

583   	Mr Niederberger admitted that "pursuant to the process of
design development, a number of things happened ... can I suggest
to you that
amongst the things that happened were, firstly, drawings changed from time to
time?
<P>

<i>A. 	Yes</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And that would mean that any list of drawings which had previously been
used between the parties in the exchange of this sort of
correspondence were
relevant and needed to be updated when the contract was actually signed.
</i>
<P>

<i>A.	They were to be incorporated in the contract.</i>
<P>

<i>Yes</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Whose job was it at Wards to make sure that the right drawings were
incorporated.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	At which date.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	At the time the contract was signed in May.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It would be Max Pittolo's." (TP381 L30 to L48).</i>
<P>

584   	Mr Niederberger also gave the following evidence:
<P>

<i>"Q.	Another thing which would happen from time to time in design meetings
and the like, was that it might be changes which were necessary
to the
specification.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And they were discussed at design meetings from time to time.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Not in particular reference to specifications, but issues that had come
up in some of the meetings would relate to specifications.</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	In any event, it was important for somebody at Wards to make sure that by
the time the contract came to be signed, somebody had
updated the specification
to make sure that it was the current version which was being incorporated in
the contract.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Well, I would have expected to be that somebody from C&amp;C would give
us a document which showed the latest understanding of
what would be in the
specification or drawings" (TP381 L56 to TP382 L22).</i>
<P>

585   	Mr Niederberger conceded:
<P>

<i>"Q.	A bill of quantities is a list of prices.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes it is.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	A scope of works is a description of what is to be done in general
terms.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	A description is enlivened by the drawings which issue from time to
time.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, that's generally the case.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And those drawings are revised from time to time.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes." (TP375 L1 to L14)</i>
<P>

586   	Mr Niederberger stated:
<P>

<i>"Q.	How do you find out how to bill the thing which is described in the bill
of quantities?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I'd refer to the drawings and the specifications.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	How would you know which drawing [or] specification to refer to.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	They were titled with the areas of work that was required.</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Yes, but how would you know which one to use? There were revisions coming
out all the time, weren't there?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	We had a </i><cite>QA system which recorded the latest documents that
would refer to our register which would say which drawing was the latest
document</cite><i>."  </i>(TP383 L40 to L55)
<P>

587   	Further, Mr Niederberger admitted that "<u>the starting
point can't be a bill of quantities can it</u>?
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>No</cite><i> ..."</i>
<P>

<i>A.	... The bill of quantities merely described the scope that Wards priced."
</i>(TP388 L41 to L43; L54 to L55)
<P>

<b>Evidence of Mr Ward</b>
<P>

588   	Mr Ward gave the following evidence:
<P>

<i>"Q.	There was a list of drawings in the May contract, wasn't there.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	It was simply not possible that that list would be same as this list
[i.e. 3 August 1993 list].</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It's possible but it is unlikely.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And the reason it is unlikely is that the parties had from August to May,
been discussing changes to these drawings.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes they had been discussing changes, yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And they had been sending and receiving respectively new documents, new
revisions, in some cases entirely different drawings.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Can I suggest to you that even a cursory review of the design meetings
shows you that every single document in the May drawing
list has been sent to
Wards in 1994.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I couldn't argue that point with you.</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>Could you seriously suggest that Wards thought, as at May 1994,
that what they were agreeing to construct was the project as defined
by the
list on page 153 (of the 3 August 1993 attachments at page 153 to Exhibit
P7</cite><i>)?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, I agree with that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Every single one of those documents was replaced before May.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Wards knew that what they had to build was what was on the drawings as at
May.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes'.</i>
<P>

<b>The Evidence of Mr Cherrie</b>
<P>

589   	Mr Cherrie was shown the drawing schedule in the letter
from the plaintiff to the defendant dated 7 July 1992 (document J4;
Levido's
Statement 13 August 1998 Exhibit P7 at p 126). He was then asked the following
questions:
<P>

<i>"Q.	And you will see at the end of the document, page 126, a list of the
drawings upon which the lump sum price is based.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes I can see that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Even though you were not involved in 1992 by 1993 when you did become
involved it was clear that that list of drawings had already
been
superseded.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I believe so.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And it continued to be developed and changed right up until the contract
was signed.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	So that when one comes to look at the list of documents constituting the
drawings and the contract of 18 May is not this list of
course.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It is certainly not that list." </i>(TP130 L58 to TP131 L16)
<P>

590   	In reference to questions as at 7 February 1994, Mr
Cherrie was asked:
<P>

<i>"Q.	Certainly the various list of drawings and the specifications which we
saw back in August 1993 and back in June 1992 had been
well and truly
superseded by now.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And even to the limited extent that this contract involved some works,
there would inevitably have been changes to the drawings
involving the works
between June 1992, August 1993 and February 1994.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes."</i> (TP189 L5 to L14)
<P>

591   	Further in his evidence, Mr Cherrie said the
following:
<P>

<i>"Q.	... can I suggest that there were a number of other matters which you
did appreciate at the time, as at 18 May? The first is,
and I list these in no
particular order of importance, you either did or did not appreciate the list
of the documents in this contract
had to be the list of documents as updated as
at 18 May.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I believe so.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	</i><cite>It would have been no point in annexing a list current in June
`92 or August `92 or any other particular time other than 18
May</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>A.	</i><cite>I agree with you</cite><i>." </i>(TP200 L29 to L40)
<P>

<b>The evidence of Mr Levido</b>
<P>

592   	Mr Levido said that it was "quite clear that it was
always appreciated that drawings schedules ... would need to be and were
in
fact amended from time to time to take up the extent of exchange (sic) between
the parties that there had been about alterations
in the design" (TP230 L9 to
L14)
<P>

593   	He gave further evidence:
<P>

<i>"I am not sure what happened after that [i.e. after he left the project in
early November 1993] but it should have been tracked. </i><cite>That was the
intention that the changes in the scope brought about by several amendments to
the design were to be monitored.</cite><i> ..."</i> (TP249 L27 to L30)
<P>

<b>Dealing with Wards' claim that the Scope of Works includes the bill of
quantities dated 19 November 1993</b>
<P>

594   	Appendix L already referred to, is a schedule of drawings
and specifications based on the documents in Folder 11A Tab 59.
 It identifies
every one of the drawings identified in the Schedule of Drawings in the 18 May
1994 Subcontract and the specifications
also identified in the Subcontract
Schedules as well as the date upon which they were provided to Wards before
their formal inclusion
in the Subcontract document.
<P>

595   	As to differentiating between the 19 November 1993 bill
of quantities and a scope of works document, as Mr Niederberger readily
acknowledged, a scope of works document is "a different thing" and "a very
different document" to a bill of quantities (TP374 L16
to L18; L55 to L57).
<P>

596   	The Scope of Works document of 12 July 1993 enclosed
under cover of document J6, includes references to drawings every one
of which
was (and I accept, was understood by Wards to be) obsolete and revised as at
May 1994.  I accept that such change was obvious.
 The Scope of Works document
refers for instance to the provision for "additional details (sic) drawings and
scope to follow ..."
(Levido page 146).  Further, each package of work within
the Scope of Works document identifies specific drawings relevant to those
works.  All except for five of the seventy-five drawings were stamped with the
notation "Preliminary: Subject to Design Development"
or similar notation
(folder 9 tabs 1(a) and 1(b)).  Section 0.1.0 Preamble of the Specification
provided with the 3 August 1993 letter
provides (Levido page 229) "this
specification will be developed into detailed technical specifications for the
purposes of subcontract
tendering and construction".
<P>

597   	Wards' case is that the bill of quantities, scope of
works and drawings as at August to November 1993 defined the scope of
the works
which it had agreed to perform.  I accept, however, that those documents merely
constitute the basis from which a TGMP
was agreed. That TGMP, through a process
of design development was, I accept, to be converted to a GMP. The conversion
process, I
accept,  involved the revision and updating of specifications and
drawings by way of the thirty two design meetings at which Wards
participated
between 5 November 1993 (folder 9 tab 46(a) and 18 May 1994 inclusive (folder
11A tab 48(a)).
<P>

598   	I further accept that if, as is acknowledged by the
Wards' witnesses, Wards were obliged to construct the works in accordance
with
the drawings and specifications as at 18 May 1994, and if those documents were
regarded by Wards as being a variation to the
November 1993 scope, then Wards
would have been obliged to issue variation notices under the draft terms of the
3 August 1993 blank
subcontract. There is no evidence before the Court to
suggest that Wards provided such notification.  I accept that the absence of
any such notification permits an inference, which I draw, that Wards did not
regard those drawings and specifications as variations
to its scope. The only
variations are those four identified in the variation summary documents
attached to the 18 April 1994 and
15 May 1994 Monthly Project Review Meeting
minutes (J14 and J16 respectively).
<P>

599   	The 19 November 1993 bill of quantities identified a
price for quantities for items of work upon which Wards based its TGMP.
Given
Wards' concessions that the drawings, specifications and design itself changed
after 17 November 1993, I accept that it cannot
follow that Wards believed the
scope of works as at 17 November 1993 to remain static and unaffected by that
development process.
The fact that drawings and specifications were updated and
issued progressively to Wards as identified in the document, Appendix
L to this
Judgment, to my mind evidences the fact that Wards could not have viewed its
bill of quantities in isolation from those
critical documents which defined
Ward's Works.  It will be recalled that the Scope of Works document
accompanying the 3 August 1993
letter advises that "additional information to
be supplied" would include a "schedule of drawings".
<P>

600   	The Scope of Works document incorporated into the 18 May
1994 subcontract makes it clear that the document "... describes
the extent of
the Works and is not meant to be complete in every detail. In particular,
detailed drawings, specifications and data
sheets (the design documents)
relating to the Works will be issued by C and C as the design development
process proceeds."
<P>

601   	That process was, I accept, ongoing after 17 November
1993.
<P>

602   	I further accept as correct, the defendant's submission
that Wards cannot reasonably assert that Civil and Civic either misled
Wards or
concealed from Wards the fact that the Scope of Works document which was
ultimately included in the 18 May 1994 Subcontract
was not in the same form as
any preceding Scope of Works document provided to Wards.
<P>

603   	Mr Pittolo acknowledged that some time before 18 May 1994
he was handed a document entitled "Scope of Works" (TP313 L25 to
L27). His oral
evidence at TP313 line 25 to TP336 L20 confirmed Mr Pittolo's evidence
contained in his witness statement of 23 November
1998 (exhibit P10) at
paragraph 6, that he received a document entitled "Scope of Works" from Mr
O'Connell, but that "it did not
occur to me that the provisions of the document
may have been amended and I paid little regard to it". (paragraph 6) Mr Pittolo
knew
that the first Scope of Works document of 12 July 1993 was no longer
accurate because the concrete structures components had been
deleted by
November 1993.
<P>

604   	I accept that Mr Pittolo's carelessness cannot be relied
upon by the Wards as a basis for asserting that Civil and Civic
deliberately
sought to impose wider obligations on Wards by including an amended Scope of
Works document in the 18 May 1994 Subcontract.
<P>

605   	Mr O'Connell's evidence is clear.  It is that on 28 April
1994 he attended a meeting at Wards' site office and said to Mr
Pittolo words
to the effect:
<P>

<i>"This is the scope of works for inclusion in the contract. Glenn told me to
speak to you about it."</i> (Statement dated 9 October 1998, exhibit D10,
paragraph 17).
<P>

606   	Mr O'Connell, in paragraph 17 of his statement, stated
that Mr Pittolo returned the document to him with some written notations
on it
in the "form of general comments" which "did not relate to any matters of
substance". In the circumstances, Mr O'Connell's
evidence on this issue is
accepted. The only explanation Mr Pittolo provided for Mr O'Connell to have
handed him the Scope of Works
document prior to 18 May 1994 was "for a review"
(TP341 L5).
<P>

607   	Mr Pittolo acknowledged the following:
<P>

<i>"Q.	... You now realise that you should have appreciated as soon as you got
it, that it was important to look at it [the scope of
works document]?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	"That is the problem I'm having. And I can't tell you why I didn't look
at it, and I can't tell you what I did with it." (TP336
L16 to L20)</i>
<P>

608   	Mr Pittolo also acknowledged that it "should have been,
but it wasn't obvious" at the time that Mr O'Connell handed him the
Scope of
Works document that resolving a Scope of Works document was something which was
required to enable the contract to be formally
concluded. (TP340 L15 to
L22).
<P>

609   	I accept that such a concession from Mr Pittolo is even
more significant in the context that he acknowledged that "<u>the scope of
works had to be agreed" because "it was obvious that the scope of works had to
be amended from that which was still current
as at 17 November 1993</u> ..."
(TP314 L25 to L28). Moreover, Mr Pittolo conceded that "it was clear that the
detail of the project and the design of the project
was not constant" and "if
anything was clear about this project it was clear that change was a feature of
it" (TP315 L30 to L37).
<P>

610   	I accept that the actions of Mr Pittolo and their
significance must be construed in the context of that state of awareness.
There
was no reason for Mr O'Connell to doubt Wards' acceptance of and agreement to
the content of the Scope of Works document which
he provided for Wards' review
<u>prior</u> to its inclusion in the 18 May 1994 Subcontract. The date of 12
April 1994 which is at the top of the Scope of Works document in
the May 1994
subcontract is, I accept, consistent with Mr O'Connell providing that document
to Mr Pittolo on or about the date which
he suggests in his witness statement
and on which he was not challenged, namely 28 April 1994.
<P>

611   	Mr O'Connell's evidence is, I accept, entirely consistent
with other aspects of Mr O'Connell's conduct in discussing and
resolving
outstanding contractual issues prior to 18 May 1994 as in the case of matters
such as those noted on his notebook entry
of 21 March (and updated on 6 April,
7 April and 21 April as indicated by that notebook entry at folder 11 tab 2)
and in accepting
with Mr Niederberger, each of the dates which Wards requested
for completion of those stages of the works identified in the two draft
schedules of substantial completion at folder 11 tab 36(a) and tab 36(b). I
further accept that the fact that Mr O'Connell included
Mr Niederberger's
requested dates as indicated on the amended second draft (folder 11 tab 36(b))
in the final version in the Subcontract,
suggests against any attempt on the
part of Mr O'Connell at any time to act with deceit or an intention to mislead
Wards in respect
of their future contractual obligations.
<P>

612   	In those circumstances and in the context of that
conduct, Wards fails in its contention that on the evidence, there was
some
mistake about the nature and content of the scope of works which it was obliged
to perform upon signing the Subcontract on 18
May 1994.
<P>

613   	In any event, the evidence is insufficient to establish
that there was a material difference between the 12 April 1994 Scope
of works
and the `Scope of Works' for which Wards contends such differences as appear
may or may not be material.  The Court cannot
determine the issue outside of
evidence as to materiality.
<P>

614   	Civil and Civic, in final submissions, prepared a
document which dealt with the chronology of the creation, discussion and
agreement to the principal earthworks drawings and specifications in the May
Subcontract.  The document is appended to the Judgment
as Appendix M.  It
clearly records the developments over time and exemplifies Civil and Civic's
central contention that changes in
design from time to time, as evidenced in
the progressive drawings, became, to Wards' knowledge and with Wards' active
participation,
part of the evolving further definition of the Scope of
Works.
<P>

615   	The bill of quantities is, as is admitted, not a scope of
works.  It is admitted that the drawings and specifications are
necessary to
define a scope of works.  The evidence establishes that those drawings and
specifications which were included in the
18 May 1994 Subcontract were all
provided to Wards before 18 May 1994. It is admitted that the Scope of Works
document would need
to be updated for inclusion in a final contract. It is
admitted that a Scope of Works document was provided to Wards prior to 18
May
1994.
<P>

616   	The scope of works as defined in paragraph 2(a) of the
contentions in the Summons cannot be accepted when Wards' own witnesses
admit
that the bill of quantities is not a scope of works but an itemisation of
quantities and cost. That is particularly the case
where the drawings and
specifications necessary to perform Wards works were under constant change and
redefinition and that those
drawings and specifications which predated 17
November 1993 were entirely irrelevant as at 18 May 1994 and known by Wards to
be irrelevant.
<P>

617   	The unsoundness of Wards' reliance on the bill of
quantities of 19 November 1993 as the basis for defining its then understood
scope of works is, I accept, also evident from the role of the bill of
quantities in a lump sum contract. Clause 10.1 of the draft
standard
subcontract terms and conditions forwarded with the 3 August 1993 letter (J6)
has, I accept, no place in elevating a bill
of quantities to a document which
defines the Works as opposed to merely providing a mechanism for measuring
works. (Clause 10.1)
<P>

618   	Furthermore, as Civil and Civic submitted, a priced bill
of quantities is for that reason, the basis upon which variations
in a lump sum
contract such as the present Subcontract may be valued or progress claims are
assessed for payment.
<P>

619   	I accept that the limited application of a bill of
quantities beyond the purpose of measuring for price estimation is apparent.
<P>

620   	I accept that on the evidence, Wards priced a bill of
quantities for the purpose of agreeing a TGMP which would then undergo
change
and refinement through a process of design participation and drawing and
specification revisions until a GMP was agreed upon.
To assume or assert that
the 19 November 1993 bill of quantities constitutes the scope of works which
would relate to the later GMP
contract then ignores the evidence that a GMP
could have been struck at a higher or lower figure than $16.7m. The evidence, I
accept,
was that the process of design development was an attempt to establish
a GMP of equal value to the TGMP, but the basis upon which
that GMP was
determined must have differed by design development. I accept that that fact is
the only way of explaining the design
development process after TGMP. If the
scope as at 17 November 1993 when the TGMP was established was to remain
unchanged, it would
be necessary for the parties to have formally agreed as at
17 November 1993 on the then current drawings and specifications. On the
evidence, those drawings and specifications were already obsolete and Wards'
own evidence was that the only matter agreed as at 17
November 1993 was a TGMP
upon which the parties would then embark in a process of design development.
That would, I accept, lead
to a situation whereby a GMP would be agreed based
on drawings and specifications which were then applicable to that sum and not
the TGMP which, on the evidence, was the culmination of the August 1993 to
November 1993 process in respect of entirely different
drawings and
specifications.
<P>

<b>Conclusion in relation to Civil and Civic's contentions VI and VII - Scope
of Works</b>
<P>

As to Contention VI - In my judgment, the evidence establishes that the 12
April 1994 Scope of Works document, forming part of the
May subcontract:
<P>

(i)	was that agreed upon by the parties;  and
<P>

(ii)	was that which bound the parties, upon the execution of the May
subcontract.
<P>

The evidence satisfies me that the parties at all material times:
<P>

(I)	saw the bills of quantities as allocating prices against items which,
although reflective of the scope of works, were not themselves
the scope of
works and might from time to time also reflect drawings and/or
specifications.
<P>

(II)	understood that design changes occurred over time, such changes being
reflected in drawings and specifications which gave form
to the scope of
works.
<P>

Contention VII is accepted as correct<i>.</i>  Wards' claims to rectification
of the Subcontract scope of works as sought in question 5(a) for the above
reasons and those which
follow, is rejected.
<P>

<b>The only agreement reached at December 1993 was an agreement for a TGMP in
the sum of $16.7million and the start of a process of design
development</b>
<P>

621   	In my view on the evidence, there is clearly also no
basis upon which Wards is entitled to a declaration in the terms sought
in
paragraph 1 of the summons which relates to question 11 of the questions for
separate determination.  The evidence of Wards' own
witnesses confirmed the
position adopted by the defendant, namely that as at 17 November 1993 the
parties had agreed on a sum of
$16.7million as a TGMP from which date the
parties would engage in a process of design development for the conversion of
the TGMP
to a GMP of equal value, so that the parties could sign a $16.7million
lump sum contract.  In the light of evidence adduced and in
particular the
cross-examination of the plaintiff's witnesses, there can be no doubt about the
parties' intentions and understandings.
<P>

622   	In the interim, however, the evidence is clear that works
proceeded not on the basis of any of the documents particularised
in paragraph
2 of the summons which are now relied upon up to 17 November 1993, but rather
proceeded on the basis of entirely separate
documents of clear legal effect,
namely the letter of intent of 6 December 1993, the purchase order and the
early works subcontract.
<P>

623   	It is unnecessary to repeat the evidence already referred
to, given by the plaintiff's witnesses.  It included, of course,
Mr Ward's
evidence that:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Nobody thought that there was already a contract at the end of 17
November [1993]?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Everybody thought that there was going to be a contract and it was coming
up?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.'   </i>[T66-67]
<P>

624   	It included the evidence given by Mr Cherrie as
follows:
<P>

<i>`Q.	Once the TGMP was agreed between the parties, there was no guarantee
that Wards would end up with the contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That is correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And Wards did not think that the agreement of a TGMP constituted a
contract for the construction of anything?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	In my capacity, in my role, yes I agree with that . . .'</i>   [T134]
<P>

625   	It included the evidence of Mr Levido, including inter
alia, that contractual matters remained unresolved up until the time
he ceased
his involvement in the TGM process:
<P>

<i>`A.	. . . Those discussion at the time of TGMP had not been completed when I
left.  As I say there were a number of proposals about
sharing savings, risks
and opportunities, nothing had been finalised.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	That was plain then as a matter of observation of what had happened as at
November, that is that these issues were to be resolved
by the final
contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A	By the time of the final contract yes.   . . .</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And you have already agreed that the draft subcontract which you had seen
in the August letters did not make any provision for
these sorts of
matters?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, it may not have, yes.</i>'   [T250-251]
<P>

626   	Mr Pittolo's evidence was to like effect at
T277.53-278.29.
<P>

627   	Mr Niederberger's evidence at T408 was to like effect in
relation to the letter of 17 November 1993:
<P>

<i>`Q.	In any event, one way or another, either by reading this letter or by
discussions amongst Wards, you knew that Wards had by this
time, 17 November,
agreed on $16.8million as the TGMP?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes that's right.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You were aware thought that nothing was certain about whether or not
there would be a contract at the end of the next process that
was looked
forward to?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes, that's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	And that what had to happen next was that there had to be further design
development before the target price could be converted
into a lump sum
contract?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.'   </i>[T408]
<P>

party A erroneously believed that the document sought to be rectified contained
a particular term or provision, or possibly did not contain a particular term
or provision which, mistakenly, it did contain;  secondly,
that the other party
B was aware of the omission or the inclusion and that it was due to a mistake
on the part of A . . .'</i>
<P>

629   	I accept as correct Mr Finch's submission that understood
correctly, Wards' case is of the first kind.  However, in testing
whether Wards
falls into that category, one immediately sees from its witnesses concessions
under cross-examination, that those witnesses
never believed that the August to
November 1993 correspondence and enclosures could constitute the final contract
- all accepted
the need to add significantly to formulate the final contract.
Hence, the rectification case fails at the very first hurdle.
<P>

630   	Nor did Wards establish on the evidence, that Civil and
Civic believed that Wards had made a mistake of any type.  On the
evidence,
Civil and Civic is not shown to have been aware that Wards entered the May
Subcontract `under a serious mistake or misapprehension
about the content or
subject matter and deliberately set out to ensure that [Wards] did not become
aware of its mistake or misapprehension'.

<P>

<b>Wards' proposed definition of `Design Development' as part of Wards' claims
to relief by way of statutory variation or rectification</b>
<P>

631   	It will be recalled, that Wards has sought to propound
its own preferred definition of design development to be included
in the
Subcontract for which it contends.  This version includes the limiting words
`[development] by way of details or by way of
improvement so as to enhance
buildability".
<P>

632   	Plainly, the Court does not redraw an executed contract
outside a cause of action such as rectification or statutory variation
being
made out.  And even then there are grave difficulties in selecting the precise
content of the new or varied wording.
<P>

633   	As to rectification, it is trite that `common intention
as to what an instrument shall say' is not to be equated with `common
belief or
understanding as to what effect an instrument shall produce'.
<P>

634   	Both parties addressed brief submissions on the Wards'
preferred definition.  
<P>

635   	It is unnecessary, in the light of the above reasons, to
travel into the possible problems with Wards' proposed redrafting
of the
definition of `Design Development'.  The whole exercise does, however, suggest
that Wards now seeks to engage in the very
exercise which by its own
carelessness, it ought to have engaged in prior to execution of the May 1996
Subcontract.  And it further
points up that even in this draft, Wards appears
to accept that design development may enlarge the scope of works to an extent,
although,
however this may be construed, not in any `material way'.
<P>

<b>The `within/without scope' construction of clause 6.30 of the Subcontract -
Relevance to Wards' causes of action</b>
<P>

636   	The proper construction of clause 6.30.1 and 6.30.2 has
earlier been set out, as has the finding, that a term to this effect
was not,
on the evidence, the intent or understanding of the parties.  The antecedent
inter partes communications and in particular
the 3 August 1993 letter did not,
in my judgment, propose that Wards be exposed to the risk, post contract, of
further design development,
save such development as would be within scope.  As
already indicated, this is accepted by Civil and Civic.
<P>

637   	This is not, however, to say that Wards' first <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade
Practices Act</a></i> count is made out.  It will be recalled that that case is
that, by presenting the Subcontract to Wards for its execution in the
circumstances
set out in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5 and/or 7 of the Contentions, and
by its alleged failure to inform Wards that the scope of works
and the terms
and conditions incorporated in the Subcontract were different to those
incorporated in the alleged November/December
1993 agreement, Civil and
Civic:
<P>

(a)	represented that the scope of works and terms and conditions incorporated
in the Subcontract were not materially different to
or, alternatively, not
inconsistent with the scope of works and terms and conditions incorporated in
the agreement;  and
<P>

(b)	engaged in conduct that was misleading or deceptive in contravention of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 52</a> of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>.</i>
<P>

638   	In so far as the first <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></i> count
is grounded upon the alleged failure of Civil and Civic to inform Wards of the
terms of the design development clauses, it
is important to recall, as Black CJ
pointed out in <i>Demagogue Pty Ltd v Ramensky &amp; Anor</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/557.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCA 557</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20ATPR%2041%2d203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) ATPR
41-203</a> at page 40844, that:
<P>

<i>`Silence is to be assessed as a circumstance like any other.  To say this is
certainly not to impose any general duty of disclosure;
 the question is simply
whether, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, there has been
conduct that is misleading or deceptive
or that is likely to mislead or
deceive.  To speak of "mere silence" or of a duty of disclosure can divert
attention from that primary
question.  Although "mere silence" is a convenient
way of describing some fact situations, there is in truth no such thing as
"mere
silence" because the significance of silence always falls to be
considered in the context in which it occurs.  That context may or
may not
include facts giving rise to a reasonable expectation, in the circumstances of
the case, that if particular matters exist
they will be disclosed'.</i>
<P>

639   	Gummow J in <i>Demagogue</i>, expressed generally the
same opinion;  `But in any case where a failure to speak is relied upon the
question must be whether in
the particular circumstances the silence
constitutes or is part of misleading or deceptive conduct' <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/557.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCA 557</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20ATPR%2041%2d203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) ATPR 41-203</a>
at page 40,851.
<P>

640   	French J in <i>Kimberley NZI Finance Ltd v Torero Pty
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20ATPR%20%28Digest%29%2046%2d054" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) ATPR (Digest) 46-054</a> at 53195, in a passage cited by Gummow J in
<i>Demagogue</i> at 40,852, said:
<P>

<i>`If in a particular case silence would, as a matter of fact, constitute
misleading or deceptive conduct, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 52</a> by virtue of its prohibition of
such conduct imposes its own statutory duty to make disclosure.</i>
<P>

<i>The cases in which silence may be so characterised are no doubt many and
various and it would be dangerous to essay any principle
by which they might be
exhaustively defined.  However, unless the circumstances are such as to give
rise to the reasonable expectation
that if some relevant fact exists it would
be disclosed, it is difficult to see how mere silence could support the
inference that
the fact does not exist.'</i>
<P>

641   	The mere fact that following negotiations between A and
B, A draws up and hands to B a form of contract for execution which,
when
properly construed, is seen to include a term which goes beyond what was agreed
upon during the negotiations, does not, without
more, prove that A has engaged
in misleading and deceptive conduct within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 52</a> of the
Act.  After all, A may have never intended that the term be so construed.  A
may have been mistaken as to the proper construction
of the term.  Had B,
immediately following execution of the contract, drawn A's attention to the
term and suggested that its correct
construction did not reflect their earlier
discussions or agreement, A may have readily accepted that suggestion and
agreed to the
term being read in a different way, or to the term being
relevantly altered in the written instrument.  
<P>

642   	Of course, the facts on close examination, may show that
A's conduct at the time of drawing up the contract and proffering
the same for
execution, or thereafter, was indeed misleading and deceptive or likely to
mislead or deceive, within the meaning of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 52.</a>  If, for example, A,
knowing that the term on its proper construction, did not reflect the
antecedent discussions or agreement, and
was silent in relation to the matter;
or ensured that B did not take the time to read the term;  or misrepresented,
by silence or
by a misleading statement what the term said or the meaning of
the term, or the advice which A had received as to the meaning of
the term, A
may, again always depending on the particular circumstances, be held to have
engaged in conduct which was misleading
or deceptive or likely to mislead or
deceive.  <i>Cf</i> <i>Asea Brown Boveri Pty Ltd v Burns Philp Trustee Co
Ltd</i> (Unreported, Supreme Court of NSW, 23 April 1990, Giles J, BC 9002518
at 20).
<P>

643   	Likewise, A may have engaged in misleading or deceptive
conduct depending on the circumstances if A, having initially believed
that the
term upon its proper construction reflected the parties' earlier negotiations
and agreement, but on later learning that
the proper construction did not so
reflect those negotiations or agreement, seeks to take advantage of the true
construction of the
term.  Here again, everything will depend upon the
particular circumstances of each case.  It is an every day occurrence to find
parties arguing strenuously in vigorously contested cases, what the proper
construction as a matter of law of a particular term in
a written agreement is.
It is plainly difficult in those circumstances for a collateral attack based
upon the parties' antecedent
negotiations to succeed, but this is not
impossible.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 52</a> provides one vehicle for such a collateral attack.  The
law of estoppel and the doctrine of rectification provide yet additional
vehicles for such collateral attack.
<P>

644   	In the present case, the evidence does not establish that
Civil and Civic engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in relation
to the
wording of so much of the Subcontract as deals with design development
variations.  All that is established is that Civil
and Civic during argument
before the Court in these proceedings, has clearly stated that `[it has] never
read, [has] never made any
claim on the basis of [and does] not read clause
6.30 in any other way than as if it said "within scope" after "development of
the
design" in 6.30.1 subclause (a)';  [final day's transcript page 38].
<P>

645   	Wards relies upon the minutes of procurement meeting
number 12 held on 6 October 1993, being an internal Civil and Civic
meeting.
Those minutes include under the subheading `Subcontract development' the
words:
<P>

<i>`TGMP - DW researching the `right words' to formalise our approach in the
subcontract document.  </i>
<P>

<i>"i.e. - you don't get any more money if the design changes"</i>
<P>

<i>.   CH to get similar clause from RD by 15 October 1993</i>
<P>

<i>.   RD also to consider need for our contractual ability to review
subcontractors' subcontracts'.   </i> [PX volume 9, tab 28 (J8AA)]
<P>

646   	Notwithstanding the cross-examination of Mr Robinson at
transcript 455-460 in relation to those minutes, I do not accept
that Civil and
Civic is shown to have set out to, nor at any time sought to draw or rely upon
a clause which would impose upon Wards
the risk of design development `outside
scope' to take place following contract.  Mr Robinson in fact, at transcript
page 458 when
tested with the above quoted words forming part of the
procurement meeting, said:
<P>

<i>`The effect of the design development clause I still believe was consistent
with the 3 August documentation, which was the invitation
to submit a TGMP.
What I am grappling with is whether or not those words reflect in how that
clause was achieved, how that clause
actually operates.  I believe the clause
that was finally drafted that was put into that document is consistent with 3
August.  Whether
or not that is consistent with that comment in those minutes,
I don't believe necessarily that it is.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You believe it is inconsistent with it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	An exercise on foot secretly before a TGMP in Civil and Civic was to come
up with words that would mean Wards would not get any
more money if the design
changed, is that right?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, that is not right.'  </i> [T458]
<P>

647   	I reject Wards' contention that the evidence adduced
before the Court seen alone or seen in combination with the failure
of Civil
and Civic to adduce evidence from a number of the witnesses who had filed
statements, treated with in terms of the <i>Jones v Dunkel</i> [(1959) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1959/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1959] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=101%20CLR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">101 CLR
298]</a> principle, establishes or permits an inference of misleading or deceptive
conduct on the part of Civil and Civic in relation to the
inclusion of the
design development clauses in the Subcontract.  Clauses in precisely the same
form had of course appeared in the
early works contract but Wards had not taken
the trouble to read those clauses.  The clauses, as they had appeared in the
Subcontract,
were in fact examined in detail by Wards within a month of 18 May
1994, for the purpose of preparing and proffering to Hornicks for
execution, a
Subcontract almost word perfect to the May Subcontract.  Clause 6.30 was at
this time closely examined for this purpose.
<P>

648   	Wards faces another difficulty on its <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices
Act</a></i> case.  I refer here to reliance.  Wards must prove a relevant nexus
between the conduct complained of and its loss.  Any loss, damage
or difficulty
which may have been suffered by Wards, was so suffered by its failing to check
the contract, as opposed, it seems to
me, by reason of any misleading or
deceptive conduct of Civil and Civic.  There was no reasonable reliance by
Wards on the alleged
misleading and deceptive conduct of Civil and Civic.  See
<i>Asea Brown Boveri</i> (supra, BC 9002518 at 21).  As Gibbs CJ said in
<i>Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd</i> (1981-82) 149 CLR
at 199;  `The heavy burdens which <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.52</a> creates cannot have been intended to be
imposed for the benefit of persons <u>who fail to take reasonable care of their
own interests</u>'.  [Emphasis added] 
<P>

<b>Do the circumstances permit a construction of the design development clauses
otherwise than the attribution of a strict legal meaning?</b>
<P>

649   	In <i>DTR Nominees Pty Ltd v Mona Homes Pty Ltd</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1978/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20138%20CLR%20423" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 138 CLR 423</a>, Stephen Jacobs JJ and Mason J, following <i>Prenn v
Simmonds</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%201%20WLR%201381" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 1 WLR 1381</a>, in a joint judgment, said:
<P>

<i>`A court may admit evidence of surrounding circumstances in the form of
"mutually known facts" to identify the meaning of a descriptive
term and it may
admit evidence of the "genesis" and objectively the "aim" of a transaction to
show that the attribution of a strict
legal meaning would "make the transaction
futile . . .".'</i>
<P>

650   	As Mason J said in <i>Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v
State Rail Authority of New South Wales</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20149%20CLR%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 149 CLR 337</a> at 352:
<P>

<i>`The true rule is that evidence of surrounding circumstances is admissible
to assist in the interpretation of the contract if the
language is ambiguous or
susceptible of more than one meaning.  But it is not admissible to contradict
the language of the contract
when it has a plain meaning.  Generally speaking
facts existing when the contract was made will not be receivable as part of the
surrounding circumstances as an aid to construction, unless they were known to
both parties, although, as we have seen, if the facts
are notorious knowledge
of them will be presumed.</i>'   [at 352]
<P>

651   	To my mind, the language of the Subcontract in terms of
the design development clauses here has a plain meaning and is not
ambiguous
nor susceptible of more than one meaning.  The question is a close one and
minds may differ on this issue.  However, as
I see the case, it is not possible
by reference to evidence restricted to the factual background known to the
parties at or before
the Subcontract, including evidence of the `genesis' and
objectively of the `aim' of the transaction, to reach a conclusion that,
there
having been an ambiguity in the design development clauses, those clauses as a
matter of construction, should be read in the
manner contended for by Civil and
Civic.
<P>

<b>`Partnering'</b>
<P>

652   	Wards used the evidence of the `partnering' aspect of the
negotiations, as a vehicle `to describe an instance of the trust
and mutual
confidence as perceived by Wards already existing between Civil and Civic . . .
and . . . as a form of conduct by Civil
and Civic objectively calculated to
engender trust, and in particular to engender an expectation of frankness and
transparency of
dealing against which . . .  [the Court] will be invited . . .
to assess the cogency of [Wards] case about <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 52</a> for <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s87.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 87</a> relief'.
[T482]
<P>

653   	In being tested as to whether or not and if so in what
fashion, Wards sought to rely upon the concept `of a joint venture
to enter
into a joint venture, or a partnership to enter into a partnership';
[<i>Cf</i> <i>United Dominions Corporation Ltd v Brian Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%2d85%29%20157%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984-85)
157 CLR 1</a> at 12 per Mason, Brennan and Deane JJ], Mr Walker said, inter
alia:
<P>

<i>`So that the word `partnership' is very explicitly not used by us in our
case to suggest the imposition of fiduciary obligations.
  . . . It is our
submission that the generalisation fiduciary obligation is apt to mislead.
Specifically we do not call in aid for
example equities abhorrence of a
conflict between interest and duty.  Not least because even if it be assumed
this was a true partnership,
whether a joint venture or not does not matter at
the moment, if a true partnership in the full sense of the word, what the
present
quarrel is about is about the terms between the partners of the same
kind as one would see in a partnership suit where of course
the parties to the
dispute were at arms length in negotiating the terms, and are at arms length in
fighting about their application.</i>
<P>

<i>So there is no conflict of interest [and] duty.  There is no admonition
against preferring your own interest, there is no resort to
arguments which
might impose constructive trusts in relation to the fruits of the endeavour to
be held on trust for both granting
and the legal entitling party remaining with
the other.  None of that applies.'    </i>[T483]
<P>

654   	Notwithstanding the evidence of the `partnering'
discussions between the parties, to my mind the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 52</a> misleading and
deceptive conduct case is not made out.  The reasons have already been set out.
And in the way, Mr Walker outlined
Wards' case on partnering, with its emphasis
on cooperation, good faith and transparency, to my mind notwithstanding those
discussions,
the whole of the circumstances do not make good the proposition
that the silence of Wards in relation to what precisely was included
in the
Subcontract by way of the design development clauses, was misleading and
deceptive.  Nor has Civil and Civic been shown to
have acted unconscionably in
relation to the Subcontract.
<P>

<b>Wards' onus of proof in relation to the alleged differences between
conditions to be found in the May 1994 Subcontract and the conditions
to be
found in the material which passed inter se up to 17 November 1993</b>
<P>

655   	Wards has relied upon what it submitted to have been
unannounced, unexplained and non-negotiated textual changes as between
on the
one hand, the terms included in the form of Subcontract enclosed with the 3
August 1993 letter and on the other hand, the
18 May 1994 subcontract.  Those
textual changes are to be found in the document marked for identification 1.
<P>

656   	Civil and Civic's response is that it is insufficient for
Wards to simply point to differences in the two documents and to
contend that
this establishes Wards' case in rectification, rescission or the other causes
of action pursued.  Civil and Civic's
submission is that Wards required to
prove that it did not agree to the particular clauses which now appear in the
May 1994 contract
but believed that the earlier Subcontract included those
clauses.  I accept Civil and Civic's submission in this regard as correct.
 I
further accept as correct, Civil and Civic's submission that the Court would
not simply infer from the generalised statement by
Wards' witnesses, that they
thought they were agreeing to something which looked like the collation of
documents from 3 August to
17 November 1993 that the May 1994 contract included
specific terms which were not agreed to by Wards.
<P>

657   	Nor do I accept Mr Walker's submission that in fact Wards
has shown that it did not agree with the differences which were
pointed up as
between the two documents.  Much attention was addressed in cross-examination
to the question of what was the scope
of work and virtually no attention was
addressed to the topic of the other clauses, the subject of MFI 1.  Paragraphs
83 and 84 of
Mr Pittolo's statement of 13 August 1998 again seek essentially to
treat with suggested material differences in the scope of works
materials.
<P>

<b>Rejection of Wards' Case</b>
<P>

658   	It follows that for the reasons given above, Wards has
not made out:
<P>

(1)	Its case in relation to the alleged Agreement of 17 November 1993 [See
Judgment para 5; Wards' written outline of final submissions
para 5;  Separate
Question 11]
<P>

(2)	Its mistake and rectification cases [See Contentions paras 6, 7;  Separate
Questions 1, 5(a), 5(b)]
<P>

(3)	Its avoidance of Subcontract case.  Whether or not it purported to avoid
the Subcontract, it had no entitlement to do so and
the Subcontract remains on
foot [Separate Question 3, Contentions paras 8, 9]
<P>

(4)	Its First <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></i> Count -
<P>

[I interpolate that Wards did not appear to press its second <i>Trade Practices
Count</i> - no submissions being directed to this case.  In any event, there is
no evidence of reliance by Wards on the `future representations'
in the signing
of the May Subcontract].  [Separate Questions 2, 7, 9]
<P>

(5)	Its estoppel case as presented.  In this regard I note the terms of
paragraph 13A of the contentions.
<P>

I did not understand Wards' case to pursue an estoppel cause of action seeking
to prevent Civil and Civic from hereafter asserting
or claiming relief on the
basis that Clause 6.30 should be read otherwise than as if the words `within
scope' had been added into
Clause 6.30.1(a) after the word `design' where
secondly appearing.  Wards has leave to address this matter in final
submissions.
<P>

(6)	Its case relying upon an alleged duty to take reasonable care in making
representations [Separate Question 8 and Question 10]
<P>

	The misrepresentations were not made.  Further, Wards' abrogation of the usual
common sense commercial obligation to look at contractual
materials prior to
executing a contract, cannot in the circumstances here proven, even accepting
the `partnering' parameter, sustain
this cause of action.
<P>

(7)	Its rescission cases (both statutory and equity based) [Wards' outline of
final submissions paragraph 3].
<P>

(8)	Its quantum meruit case [Separate Question 4].  The parties are bound in
Contract.
<P>

(9)	Its damages cases [Separate Question 10]
<P>

Short Minutes of Order.
<P>

The parties are to bring in Short Minutes of Order at which time submissions
may be addressed on any claim said not to have been
dealt with, on the matter
relating to estoppel in respect of which Wards have been given leave to address
and on costs.
