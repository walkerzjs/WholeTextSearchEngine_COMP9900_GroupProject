<center><b><u>Joseph ASSAF &amp; ANOR  v  Theodore SKALKOS &amp;
ANOR</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT -  See p 1556 of transcript</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>: I have before me an application by Mr Hughes
QC for the plaintiffs that I give a ruling, before the addresses commence in
relation
to the evidence of Mr Assaf at page 447, line 50, when, against
objection, he was required to read aloud a portion of a letter dated
26 June
1995 from the Australian Chinese Daily to Telecom.  A direction is sought that
such evidence cannot be used, as probative
in any way, of the truth of the
complaint in the letter and is irrelevant to any issue in the case.
<P>

2  	The judgment which I am about to give should be read in
conjunction with the interlocutory judgment I delivered on 1 December
1999, a
copy of which has been provided to all parties in the draft form in which it
was taken out by the Court Reporting Branch.
 It has not, as yet, been revised
by me.
<P>

3  	It is necessary, however, for the sake of good order that I
repeat certain aspects of the material that is contained in that
judgment.
<P>

4  	There was a particular of the justification defence approved by
Levine J upon which the defendants indicated that they would
rely as
justification of the imputation which is in the following terms:
<P>

"The plaintiffs conduct the business of Ethnic Communications Pty Ltd by
employing bullying tactics towards the smaller ethnic media
organisations to
make them too frightened to complain about their unethical and wasteful
conduct".
<P>

5  	That imputation is not relied upon in the second publication.
<P>

6  	Broadly stated, the particular was that the Chinese Daily
newspaper Advertising Manager was intimidated by ETCOM in relation
to the
Telecom advertising in that newspaper.  The subject letter was discovered, as
part of the discovery process, by the solicitors
for the plaintiffs.  It is not
known how the document came into their possession.
<P>

7  	It was first referred to in the evidence on 9 November 1999
during of the cross-examination by Mr Littlemore QC for the defendants,
of Mr
Assaf.
<P>

8  	At p444, Mr Littlemore put the following question: 
<P>

"Q. You knew the Australian Chinese Daily complained to Telstra you were
demanding 20 per cent commission for Telstra advertising".
 
<P>

Mr Assaf commenced to answer that question, saying:
<P>

"They could not afford ...".
<P>

9  	His answer was interrupted by an objection by Mr Hughes who
stated "The fact a complaint is made is nothing to the point". 

<P>

10  	I allowed the question commenting, "It will fall to the ground
if it is denied and not taken up.  I don't know what is going
to happen"
(transcript 445).
<P>

11  	The cross-examination continued:
<P>

"Q.	You knew the Australian Chinese Daily complained to Telstra that you were
demanding 20 per cent on Telstra advertising which
they could not afford? 
<P>

A.	I knew the Australian Chinese Daily wrote to Telstra and asked for what
Telstra asked them.
<P>

Q.	You knew they considered your attitude to be intimidatory, didn't you?
<P>

A.	No, I didn't know that.  I knew they wrote to Telstra and told them what
they considered".
<P>

The use of the plural pronoun "they" should be noted.
<P>

"Q.	Have you seen the letter?
<P>

A.	I have seen the letter.
<P>

Q.	In the letter they say your attitude was intimidatory".
<P>

12  	Mr Hughes objected.  Mr Littlemore then had the document, which
had been marked MFI 15, shown to the witness, and (at 446)
he posed the
following question:
<P>

"Q.	I show you both documents, (MFI 15 and copy thereof).  You told the jury
that the Chinese Daily did not complain that they found
your conduct
intimidating, didn't you.  You did say that didn't you?
<P>

A.	I still say because I know what came after when the client wrote to the
Chinese Daily and they confessed they did it without
any knowledge of any
intimidation".
<P>

13  	I interpose, presumably that's a reference to a letter by
Telecom to the Chinese Daily. Mr Littlemore then put:
<P>

"Q.	So you say.  Would you please look at the letter and the highlighted part
of it.  Would you read that out to the jury, please".
<P>

14  	Mr Hughes objected, and submitted that the letter was
inadmissible because of its entirely hearsay character.  In response,
Mr
Littlemore relied upon <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s69</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></u>, 1995, and asserted it
was a business record and, as such, was proof of the statements it contains.
<P>

15  	The proposition that it was a business letter was challenged by
Mr Hughes.  I commented (at 447): 
<P>

"I find it a difficult problem.  I find it difficult to rule upon this in
isolation, as it were, because if the matter is going
to be pursued further
down the line surely the defendant is entitled to deal with the matter while
the plaintiff is in the witness
box.  That is how it seems to me".
<P>

16  	If I could say, parenthetically, it's clear enough that what was
in my contemplation (at least) was the rule in <u>Browne v Dunn</u>, and if the
matter were to be pursued in accordance with the particulars, Mr Littlemore was
obviously required to put to the witness
the content of the letter in order to
give the witness the opportunity to deal with it.  That is obviously what was
running through
my mind, to the extent that that is relevant.
<P>

17  	Thus, I allowed the reading of the letter, and the last
paragraph was read on to the transcript:
<P>

"We don't wish to lose Telecom advertising but consider this matter to be most
intimidating and call upon your assistance".
<P>

18  	The question was then put by Mr Littlemore:
<P>

"Q.	I put to you that the conduct of which the Australian Chinese Daily
complained was typical of your conduct towards the ethnic
newspapers that would
not agree to your rate for the Age Pension News in 1992?"
<P>

19  	That question was objected to by Mr Hughes, "on the simple
ground that the question assumes there was conduct congruent with
the
complaint".
<P>

20  	The question was withdrawn and put in the following form:
<P>

"Q.	I put to you a complaint was made by the Australian Chinese Daily and was a
truthful one.  What do you say?
<P>

A.	It is not truthful.
<P>

Q.	I put to you that they were in fact intimidated by your conduct because they
said in the letter?
<P>

A.	They said they were not".
<P>

21  	I am recorded as having said to the witness:  
<P>

"Excuse me that can be answered yes or no?"
<P>

22  	There is no record in the transcript of what prompted me to make
that statement.  However something must have been said.
<P>

23  	The witness replied: "No, it was not intimidating".
<P>

24  	Mr Littlemore put to the witness:
<P>

"Q.	I put to you further, acknowledging your last two answers, you engaged in
intimidating conduct towards other ethnic newspapers
in 1992 and 1993 when they
would not agree to the reduced rate for government placement?
<P>

A.	That is not true.
<P>

Q.	Do you agree that if you or your staff sought discounts or other benefits
from ethnic newspapers and did it stating that non-compliance
would result in
them being denied government work, that would amount to bullying?
<P>

A.	So we understand the question, your Honour, because I find it difficult to
understand.  We only ask a discount if the client
ask us to ask for it".
<P>

25  	The witness then explained that he was having difficulty with
the question and pointed out that he has difficulty with the
English language,
as it is his third language.
<P>

26  	Then it was put to him:
<P>

"Q.	Do you agree that if you or your company's staff sought discounts or other
benefits from ethnic newspapers and did it stating
that non-compliance would
result in them being denied government work, that would amount to bullying?
<P>

A.	It does not amount to bullying if I ask for the clients, or want clients
have a discount".
<P>

Mr Hughes submitted that the answer should read "If I ask for the clients, or
want clients to have a discount."
<P>

Mr Littlemore submitted that the word "to" should be in brackets as understood,
otherwise he would withdraw the agreed correction.
<P>

27  	For present purposes, it is sufficient that the parties agreed
that the sense of the answer was "It does not amount to bullying
if I ask for
the clients or want clients to have a discount".  It shall be noted that the
defendants did not call the author of the
letter, or adduce any explanation for
his not being called. 
<P>

28  	There were no further references in the trial to the Chinese
Herald until such time as the defendants sought to tender the
letter in
question( MFI 15) which was rejected by me for the reasons given in the
interlocutory judgment on 1 December 1999.
<P>

29  	I shall not repeat what I said in that judgment by way of
reasons, except to indicate that I formed the view that on the assumption
that
the letter was prima facie a business record, it nevertheless did not fall
within the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s69(2)</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></u>, 1995, but on the
assumption that I was in error in that regard, the letter should be rejected
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s135(a)</a> of that Act.
<P>

30  	I might say, re-reading that judgment which I was required to do
for the purposes of the present application, reference could
conveniently also
be made to subs(5) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s69</a> which provides:
<P>

"For the purposes of this section, a person is taken to have personal knowledge
of a fact if the person's knowledge of the fact
was or might reasonably be
supposed to have been based on what the person saw, heard, or otherwise
perceived, (other than a previous
representation made by a person about the
fact)."
<P>

31  	To the extent that the letter very significantly uses the
personal pronoun 'we' and is written by the Advertising Manager of
the company,
it seems to me that the exception, "other than a previous representation made
by a person about the fact" is relevant.
<P>

32  	Thus, by way of illustration, if the author had said `I consider
this matter to be most intimidating' and, for example, `the
managing director
informed me that he (or she) considered it to be most intimidating', that
latter representation would be, to my
mind, second hand hearsay and fall foul
of the exception in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s69(5).</a>
<P>

33  	In any event I am bound by the judgment I earlier gave and I
have no reason in any way to withdraw what I there said, or the
ultimate view
which I expressed.
<P>

34  	So, focusing now upon the last paragraph of the letter which was
read out by the first plaintiff at page 447, the point must
be made that it
still carries the problem that the plural personal pronoun "we" is used.  And
to my mind, the material which was
read out to the jury (being portion of the
letter) could only constitute an asserted complaint by the Australian Chinese
Daily to
a third party, Telecom.
<P>

35  	It could not, in my view, constitute evidence going to the
substantial truth of the imputation of bullying tactics and consequential
fear
which I have earlier set out.
<P>

36  	It does not go to establishing, in other words, that the
imputation was true in substance and in fact.
<P>

37  	One should also recall that the imputation contains a number of
elements, one being that the plaintiffs conduct the business
of Ethnic
Communications by employing bullying tactics and those tactics were directed
towards the smaller ethnic media organisations
to make them too frightened to
complain about their unethical and wasteful conduct.
<P>

38  	What arose from the cross-examination of Mr Assaf and his
reading out of the portions of the letter (at page 447) is completely
insufficient, in my view, to go to the truth of the elements of the imputation.
Or to put it another way, to go to the sting of the
imputation, which includes,
of course, a fear of complaining about what was said to be unethical and
wasteful conduct by the plaintiffs.
 And I am satisfied, by the application of
the relevant principles in the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></u>, that it cannot be construed
as truth of what is stated in the letter, to the extent that it was read out by
the witness.
<P>

39  	Thus, I am prepared to accede to the application that the
evidence of Mr Assaf at page 447 line 50, when against objection,
he was
required to read aloud portion of the letter from the Australian Chinese Daily
cannot be used as probative in any way of the
truth of the complaint and is
irrelevant to any issue in the case.
<P>

40  	I might say, parenthetically, it does seem a little odd, apart
from anything I have said above, that such a letter of complaint
could be used
as evidence that an ethnic newspaper may have been too frightened to complain.
However, that is not essential to my
decision.
<P>

41  	The second leg of the application made by Mr Hughes is that
there be a direction that Mr Assaf's answer at p448, line 15, cannot
go to his
credit because the answer is consistent with some communication, not explored
in the cross-examination, having occurred
between Mr Assaf and someone else
about the letter.  That is the question I read earlier: "Q. I put to you they
were in fact intimidated
by your conduct as they said in the letter? A. They
said they were not".
<P>

42  	I find it difficult to make a ruling at this stage in relation
to what is essentially a factual matter and without being perfectly
clear in my
own mind what counsel for the defendants may or may not say about the effect of
that question and that answer.
<P>

43  	Mr Hughes has made it perfectly clear that if any of the
answers, one could fairly say, given by Mr Assaf during the relevant
cross-examination, which I have set out above, is sought to be used by the
defendants as going to the credit of the first plaintiff
then he would object.
And he has submitted in advance that in his assessment, if I could use that
expression, it could result in
an application for discharge of the jury.  That
is not a matter with which I feel that it is my responsibility to deal with in
advance,
by that I mean to give a ruling, at this stage, on the matter raised
in paragraph 2 of MFI 67.
<P>

44  	The defendants are bound by the ruling I have given in  relation
to the portion of the letter read out, and one would expect
that that ruling
will not be abused in any sense.  I do not mean that in a pejorative sense.
<P>

45  	At this stage I am not prepared to give the direction sought in
paragraph 2 of MFI 67.
