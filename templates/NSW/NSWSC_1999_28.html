<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (On application for separate trials of defences)</b>
<P>

1	An application has been made by the plaintiff that can be summarised thus:
that the issues of qualified privilege, contextual
truth and substantial truth
and public interest should be tried first;  if the plaintiff succeeds on those
issues, the issue of damages
should then be tried.  
<P>

2	It is posited that assuming that the jury finds publication by the defendant,
that the publication carries all or some of the
imputations and that all or
some of the imputations are defamatory, then in the "<i>singular</i>"
circumstances of this case the course applied for should be followed.
<P>

3	I assume that the reference to the finding as to publication by the defendant
arises from a curiosity in the drafting of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act,
1974</a></i>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 7A</a> deals with the function of the judge and the jury and in
sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) it appears tolerably clear that whether a
matter
is capable of conveying an imputation and whether that imputation is capable of
being defamatory is a matter for the judge.
 In particular sub-section (3)
provides that upon the Court determining the question of capacity and
defamatory meaning, "<i>the jury is to determine whether the matter complained
of carries the imputation and, if it does, whether the imputation is
defamatory"</i>.  This is another way of stating the usual procedure that
whether "<i>in fact</i>" the imputation is conveyed and is defamatory is a jury
matter.
<P>

4	Sub-section (4) however commences with the words "<i>if the jury determines
that the matter complained of was published by the defendant and carries an
imputation ..."</i>  This is the first reference to any determination by the
jury (under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A)</a> that the matter complained of "<i>was published by the
defendant"</i>.  The cause of action in defamation is the imputation conveyed
by what is described as a "<i>matter</i>" in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 9(1).</a>
<P>

5	Conformably with what is enacted in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A(1)</a>, (2) and (3) one would have
expected sub-section (4) merely to state, for example, "<i>if the jury
determines that the matter complained of carries an imputation that is
defamatory of the plaintiff, the Court and not
the jury"</i> is to determine
any defence and the matter of damages.  Another alternative anticipated wording
of sub-section (4) would be "<i>if the jury determines that the matter
complained of published by the defendant carries an imputation ..."</i>  In
this last mentioned instance the words "<i>published by the defendant</i>"
would be otiose;  no other matter would be the subject of consideration by the
jury.  
<P>

6	No particular submissions were made in relation to the opening words of
sub-section (4) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A</a> and whether anything, in this trial, turns on those
words, at this stage, is unknown.
<P>

7	It is submitted that the scheme of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A</a> clearly requires a separate
consideration of the defences and damages as disparate issues.  It is argued
that in the circumstances
of this litigation separate trials would be eminently
logical.  The structure, if the application is acceded to, would involve the
plaintiff himself giving evidence and calling witnesses in answer to the
defendant's evidence in respect of each defence but upon
a finding, the
defendant having gone first, that the defences were not established, the
plaintiff would then give evidence on the
issue of damages.
<P>

8	It is submitted that the procedure suggested does not amount to "<i>case
splitting"</i>.  If the jury find the imputations or some of them are
defamatory then damage to the plaintiff is presumed and the plaintiff's case
is
established.  The defendant then bears the onus of establishing the defences
pleaded.  However the case proceeds, the issue of
aggravated damages would
necessarily be revisited at the end of all the defence evidence and there would
seem to be little point,
it is said, in any event in requiring the plaintiff to
give some evidence on damages and calling witnesses as to damages before the
defences are litigated.  Damages would be relevant only if the defences are not
established.  From that last proposition I assume
it to be meant that damages
would be relevant in the sense of damages over and above what is presumed to be
the damage from the mere
publication of defamatory imputations.
<P>

9	The defendant alleges, it is said, grave and sustained criminal behaviour on
the part of the plaintiff over a long period of time
in the context, not of
sexual intercourse with adult men, but acts of sodomy and other sexual acts
with teenage boys, most aged around
15.  The sting in the accusations (the
imputations) is not homosexual conduct <i>per se (</i>even when illegal), but
homosexual acts with teenagers younger than 18 (now the age of consent), and
damage thereby caused to them,
particularly psychological damage (this arising
from the second matter complained of).
<P>

10	The plaintiff therefore has to meet accusations of many serious crimes and
presumably the defendant will call considerable evidence
in attempting to prove
the truth of its imputations.  
<P>

11	It is said that it would be "<i>unjust and contrary to principle</i>" to
require the plaintiff to defend himself against so many and such grave charges
at a stage when they are no more than "<i>unproved accusations</i>".  By that I
understand the plaintiff to be asserting that "<i>they</i>" are no more than
"<i>accusations</i>" in respect of which no <i>evidence</i> will have been
called if the plaintiff proceeds in the normal course.  Such a procedure, it is
said, would be a reversal of the onus
of proof.  The plaintiff cannot
reasonably be expected to give evidence in his "<i>defence</i>' without first
hearing the evidence to be lead against him and without first confronting his
accusers.
<P>

12	The allegations against the plaintiff as particularised go back
approximately 29 years;  they extend over a period of thirteen
years.  It is
said in the submissions that these allegations are made by people most of whom
have criminal records:  in this regard,
at the time the submissions were made,
I have no evidence of that fact.  That the plaintiff vehemently denies the
allegations is
not in dispute.  The allegations have never been the subject of
criminal charges against the plaintiff.
<P>

13	The defendant's case will necessarily be the subject of extensive
cross-examination of the plaintiff and it is impossible reasonably
to
anticipate that in the case of any single witness the evidence will support the
particulars relied upon by the defendant.  
<P>

14	It is argued that it would unjust if the plaintiff were required to make
answer to such serious charges without first hearing
the evidence lead to
sustain them.  Equally, it would be unjust if the defendant were able to
cross-examination the plaintiff about
issues not yet the subject of evidence by
the defendant and in respect of which the defendant bears the onus of proof.

<P>

15	Mr Barker Q.C. for the plaintiff naturally gave no undertaking that the
plaintiff would give evidence in answer to the defendant's
evidence before the
decision was made as to whether the defences were established, assuming the
model advanced for the plaintiff
was put in place.  On the other hand, Mr
Barker frankly conceded that it was highly unlikely that the plaintiff would
not give evidence
in such circumstances.
<P>

16	It is submitted that the Court has power to order a trial of the defences
separate from the trial of the issue as to damages.
 This power arises from <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
85(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> </i>which provides:
<P>

	<i>"The Court may order that any questions of facts in any proceedings be
tried before any other questions of fact in the proceedings".</i>
<P>

17	Reliance is further placed on the provisions of SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31</a> r 2 which provides
that the Court may make orders for "<i>(a) the decision of any question
separately from any other question, whether before, at or after any trial or
further trial in the
proceedings; ..."</i>
<P>

18	In support of the application Mr Barker Q.C. produced in writing an analysis
of the defence case on the issue of justification
as is presently known or as
it will be in the event of any amendment being allowed in relation to
particulars.  I do not propose
to set out the detail of Mr Barker's analysis.
Obviously, the defence case on justification and contextual justification is of
very
substantial proportions in terms of history, personalities and acts.  
<P>

19	The defendants case on justification has, however, been particularised.  Its
ambit is known.  Its dimensions are known.  The
facts, matters and
circumstances have been detailed by the defendant.  The only thing that the
plaintiff does not have is the "<i>evidence" </i>in support of the case pleaded
and particularised in accordance with the rules and usual procedure in a civil
action of this kind.
 It is the very function of pleadings that cases in chief,
in defence and in reply and the particulars thereof, are set out for each
side
to inform the other as to what the cases to be presented are.  The evidence by
which those cases will be sought to be proved
is another matter.  The present
structure however in the light of the pleadings and particulars is unremarkable
in a case which,
as Mr Wheelhouse was at pains to point out and stress, is one
brought by the plaintiff against the defendant for damages for defamation,
which action the defendant is entitled to defend.
<P>

20	In the normal course of events, as Mr Wheelhouse pointed out, the plaintiff
would be entitled to call evidence described by him
as "<i>in reply</i>" in two
areas:  the first would be in respect of any evidence called by the defence in
its case on justification which came as a
surprise or embarrassment to the
plaintiff presumably in the context where none of such additional surprising
material had been put
to the plaintiff or his witnesses in cross-examination.
That would clearly be the case and justice would demand that the plaintiff
have
an opportunity to respond to such material.  The second area in which the
plaintiff would be permitted to call evidence in reply
(or further evidence)
would be on the issue of damages in that area which is usually the subject of
evidence in defamation actions
namely, that at the conclusion of the defence
case the plaintiff would be entitled to call evidence going to the issues of
aggravated
damages arising from the conduct of its case by the defendant, the
additional evidence on aggravation of damages being founded upon
the improper
or unjustifiable conduct of the defence case.  
<P>

21	Mr Barker Q.C. referred to me the Canadian decision of <b><i>Jerome v
Anderson </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%2044%20DLR%20%282d%29%20516" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 44 DLR (2d) 516</a> in which I understood the Supreme Court
of Canada to have held that where in an action for libel in which justification
is pleaded
in defence, the plaintiff offers evidence and indeed, is himself a
witness, it is in the discretion of the trial judge when so requested
at the
outset, to permit the plaintiff to postpone giving evidence against the plea of
justification until the defendant has given
his evidence thereon and to limit
the cross-examination of the plaintiff and his witnesses accordingly.
Alternatively, the trial
judge may, in his discretion permit cross-examination
of the plaintiff and his witnesses at large while reserving his right to adduce
rebuttal evidence on the plea of justification after the defendant's case
thereon is complete.  This alternative direction appears
apposite in the
circumstances of this trial.
<P>

22	It is to be noted that the defendant's application is not precisely of the
kind referred to in <b><i>Jerome</i></b>.  The defendant's application is that
the defendant's case as a whole proceeds, that there be a finding thereon and
then the plaintiff
and evidence on damages.  
<P>

23	That is, if the plaintiff gives evidence on the issue of justification (and
presumably on any other aspect of the defence, namely
privilege and malice),
the trial judge would then rule on whether defences have been made out
whereupon consequent upon a ruling
favourable to the plaintiff, the plaintiff
would give his evidence on damages.  This suggested model is starkly different
to what
the Court was considering in <b><i>Jerome</i></b> or what had earlier
been considered by the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Beevis v Dawson</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281957%29%201%20QB%20195" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1957)
1 QB 195</a> and the earlier pronouncement by Abbott CJ in <b><i>Browne v
Murray</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281825%29%20Ry%20%26%20M%20254" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1825) Ry. &amp; M 254.</a>
<P>

24	That the discretions referred to in <b><i>Browne</i></b> by Abbott CJ and
<b><i>Jerome</i></b> are available is quite clear.  It is submitted that their
availability and their exercise would adequately protect the plaintiff
from
surprise from any evidence called in chief by the defendant in its case on
justification over and above that which in the normal
course would be put to
the plaintiff in cross-examination conformably with the ambit of the defence
case as pleaded and particularised,
and importantly, as might arise in
cross-examination of the plaintiff on that component of his case on damages
involved in his asserting
that the falsity of the imputations increased the
hurt to his feelings.  This last component will inevitably intrude upon the
area
of justification.
<P>

25	The model advanced for the plaintiff in its application would, in my view,
invert if not pervert the structure of what is a civil
claim for damages for
defamation.  It will prejudice the defendant in the conduct of its case on all
issues of the defence and on
issues of damages and give rise to a serious risk
that the Court will be called upon to decide substantive issues in
circumstances
where the parties and particularly the defendant has not been
provided with the usual opportunities for the adducing of evidence
in support
of its case.
<P>

26	Leaving aside the issues involved in the other defences (privilege at common
law and under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 22</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act, 1974</a></i>), the defence of
justification is, as has to be acknowledged, a substantial one;  it has been
pleaded and particularised and the
plaintiff can be confronted with it and deal
with it in his case and, by leave in the exercise of discretion in the
circumstances
I have referred to, by the calling of further of evidence, if
necessary, in rebuttal.
<P>

27	<b><i>Browne, Beevis </i></b>and <b><i>Jerome</i></b> are authorities that
go to the existence of the discretions to which I have referred (see also
<b><i>Downs Irrigation Co-operative Association Limited v The National Bank of
Australasia Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20Qd%20R%20130" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) Qd R 130).</a>  None of those cases provides
authority for the course proposed by the plaintiff for which however there is
power to order under
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></i> and rules.  Nothing in the
structure of the case, given the existence of the discretions, warrants the
departure from the normal
conduct of a defamation action of this kind.  
<P>

28	I note that Mr Barker has stated that the plaintiff's case on damages could
last up to three weeks with at least 30 witnesses;
 so be it.  As Mr Wheelhouse
remarked it might well be that should the course advanced for the plaintiff be
adopted to the point
where I make a ruling on the defences, the defendant will
have been deprived of cross-examining plaintiff's witnesses on damages
in areas
that might well also intrude on the issue of justification.
<P>

29	Accordingly, I decline to order either pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s85.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 85(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme
Court Act</a></i> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31</a> r 2 of the Supreme Court Rules the separate trial of the
defences of justification, contextual justification and qualified privilege
with any consequential judgment thereon prior to the hearing of any case the
plaintiff proposes to make on the issue of damages,
and the plaintiff's motion
therefor is dismissed.
