<P>

<b>2388/99 -  RE NEW CAP REINSURANCE CORPORATION (BERMUDA) LTD &amp; THE
CORPORATIONS LAW</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR   </b> These are applications for the appointment of a
provisional liquidator to each company in unusual circumstances.  Both the
companies
involved in these proceedings are incorporated in Bermuda.
<P>

2	In each case the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda has applied to the Supreme
Court of Bermuda for an order that the company be
wound up on the just and
equitable ground.  Under the law of Bermuda, the Registrar is a proper
plaintiff for such an application.
 In each case the Supreme Court of Bermuda
has ordered that a provisional liquidator be appointed.
<P>

3	The structure of the Group is that New Cap Reinsurance Corporation Holdings
Limited is the holding company of the Group, the Bermuda
company is the
operating company in Bermuda and there are two Australian companies which
appear to be wholly owned by the Bermudan
company, namely NC Re Capital Limited
and New Cap Reinsurance Corporation Limited.  I will refer to these four
corporations respectively
as "Holdings", "Bermuda", "NC" and "Australia".
<P>

4	Holdings is duly registered in Australia as a foreign corporation, ACN 076
137 249.  Bermuda is not so registered.  
<P>

5	The Corporations Law makes a series of provisions for the winding up in this
State or in Australia of corporations that are incorporated
outside Australia.
Section 580 defines an "external administration matter" as meaning, inter alia,
a matter relating to winding up
a company or a Part 5.7 body.   Section 581
provides that all courts having jurisdiction in matters arising under the
Corporations
Law of NSW must severally act in aid of each other and may act in
aid of the courts of other countries even though those other countries
are not
prescribed countries in external administration matters.  Bermuda is not a
prescribed country (the list of prescribed countries
is set out in Regulation
5.6.74).  The colonies and protectorates of prescribed countries are also
prescribed, but this has no significance
in the case of Bermuda.
<P>

6	A "Part 5.7 body" is defined in s 9 of the Corporations Law as a registrable
body that is registered under Part 5B.2 or carries
on business in this
jurisdiction (or, which is not relevant in the instant case, an association of
more than five members).
<P>

7	Holdings is clearly a Part 5.7 body as it is registered under Part 5B.
Bermuda is only a Part 5.7 body if it carries on business
in this jurisdiction,
ie NSW.  However, as I am properly asked to apply the cross vesting laws of the
other States of Australia (this
is not a Federal matter so any problems with
Federal jurisdiction are irrelevant), I have to consider whether Bermuda is a
Part 5.7
body in other States and Territories of Australia.
<P>

8	In my view, when the court is considering an application for the appointment
of a provisional liquidator all that it needs to
consider is whether there is a
prima facie case that the foreign entity concerned is a Part 5.7 body.  I put
aside the probability
that this court may have some inherent power to appoint a
provisional or final liquidator in respect of the assets of a foreign
corporation
which is not a Part 5.7 body.  I merely mention this in case it be
thought that I had excluded this possibility.
<P>

9	The evidence before the court derives principally from the provisional
liquidator in Bermuda.  He says that the affairs of the
four companies are
intertwined.  They are all involved, apart from Holdings which appears merely
to be a holding company, in the
business of reinsurance.  Each appear to cede
some risks to the others. Unfortunately, as is not uncommon in closely
connected corporations,
they do not keep records which identify exactly which
company is bearing which risk.  However, the material before the court at the
present is that the Bermuda company has invested perhaps up to $US98 million in
Australia, it has issued letters of credit to Australians
and it holds
insurance policies over risks in Australia.  A question is whether this amounts
to carrying on business in NSW (or Victoria
etc) so as to make it a Part 5.7
body.  
<P>

10	"Carry on business" is defined in s 21 of the Law.  The mere fact that a
foreign corporation invests its funds or holds property
in NSW is not of itself
sufficient.  What amounts to carrying on business is a complex question of fact
in which previous decisions,
particularly those decided on other legislation
are of little help.  The expression "has to be construed in its context" in
this
statute:  <b>Orbit Travel Services v Travel Compensation Fund </b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/63.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999]
NSWCA 63</a> at para 139.
<P>

11	I agree with the submission of Mr Coles QC and Mr J Priestley for the
applicant that this fact together with the letters of credit
would prima facie
show that Bermuda is carrying on business in Australia.  Although I would not
wish this comment to be taken amiss
by those in other States, I would infer
that this means carrying on business in at least Sydney and Melbourne where the
bulk of this
business is transacted.  Accordingly, so far as the Corporations
Law as applicable in NSW and Victoria is concerned, prima facie
Bermuda is
carrying on business in each of those States and accordingly is a Part 5.7
body.  
<P>

12	As a Part 5.7 body, both Holdings and Bermuda may be wound up under s 583 of
the Corporations Law including (vide s 583(c)(ii))
 on the ground that it is
just and equitable to wind the company up.  
<P>

13	Additionally, so far as Holdings is concerned, s 601CL(14) provides that
when a registered foreign company commences to be wound
up ... in its place of
origin then the court shall, on application by the person who is the liquidator
for the foreign company's
place of origin ... appoint a liquidator of the
foreign company.  This provision would apply to Holdings but not to Bermuda.
<P>

14	Accordingly, with Holdings there are three provisions of the Corporations
Law and with Bermuda at least two, which would authorise
this court to wind up
the companies in NSW and by cross vesting, at least in Victoria as well.
<P>

15	The registered local agent of Holdings is Australia.  The evidence before
the court is that NC and Australia, when they heard
about the problems of
Holdings in Bermuda, appointed Mr Gibbons as voluntary administrator.  As Mr
Gibbons is the person sought to
be appointed as provisional liquidator of
Holdings and Bermuda, there is no necessity as there would be in the ordinary
case to ensure
that the local agent has notice of this application before an
order is made.
<P>

16	The exact nature of the problems of these companies is not clear on the
evidence at this stage.  It is significant that the Government
authorities
moved in Bermuda for winding up and that the court in Bermuda, having heard the
argument, appointed a provisional liquidator.
<P>

17	In recent years,  the problem of corporations in trouble which have assets
around the world has become an increasing problem.
 Winding up law is still
basically a fairly local affair, but when there are troubles with the company
or group of companies which
have assets throughout the world, then special
action has to be taken to ensure as much as possible that the worldwide public
is
protected.   To this end the courts throughout the world and particularly
courts in Australia must obey the philosophy of s 581 of
the Corporations Law
and facilitate as much as possible the control of assets throughout the world.
Of course, proper considerations
must be given at each step to the rights of
the corporators, the directors and others, but it is often necessary to act
quickly to
protect assets and if any error is to be made, to err on the side of
protection rather than permitting assets to be in jeopardy.
<P>

18	In the instant case, there have already been proceedings with this group of
companies in the High Court of Justice in England
where upon letter of request
from an Australian court, the Chancery Division has made orders and in the
Bankruptcy Courts of New
York in the United States of America.  Those actions
plus the actions in Bermuda give impetus to the application that the assets
should be protected in Australia.  
<P>

19	I need to mention two overseas cases concerning the approach taken in
multi-national liquidations.  In <b>Re Dallhold Estates (UK) Pty Ltd </b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%20BCLC%20621" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] BCLC 621</a>, application was made to the Chancery Division by letter of
request from the Federal Court of Australia to deal with the assets in
England
of one of the Bond group of companies incorporated in Western Australia.
Chadwick J, considering a section similar to s 581
of the Corporations Law said
at p 627 that the court whose assistance was sought ought "give the assistance
required - unless there
is some compelling reason why that should not be done."
That has been the consistent policy of the English courts;  see <b>Re Business
City Express Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%202%20BCLC%20510" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 2 BCLC 510</a>, 513 and cases there cited.  
<P>

20	As far as I am aware, there are no Australian cases on this point, but in my
view Australian courts should apply the same principle
as is applied in
England.
<P>

21	The application before me is for the appointment of a provisional liquidator
and to appoint the person who has been nominated
by the provisional liquidator
in Bermuda and who is also the voluntary administrator of the two companies in
the Australian group.
 I consider that this, in the current circumstances, is a
sensible thing to do and so I will give the necessary leave under s 532(2)
of
the Law for that person to be the provisional liquidator.
<P>

22	The court's power to appoint a provisional liquidator is mainly found in s
472 of the Corporations Law.  I asked Mr Coles QC
and Mr Priestley why I should
appoint a provisional liquidator.  They referred me to cases such as <b>Re Club
Mediterranean Pty Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%20ACLC%2040%2d204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] ACLC 40-204</a> at p 28,238 where Bright J said,
"Where the company itself applies for the appointment of a provisional
liquidator, the appointment
is usually made without query ...".  However, one
must read the next part of his Honour's sentence which was "for such an
application
implies that the board of directors of the company considers that
such appointment is necessary or would be beneficial."  That latter
part of the
sentence shows that where one has a situation as here where whilst it is the
company that is technically making the application
because it is making it via
its court appointed liquidator in another place, neither the board of directors
nor the shareholders
have had anything to do with the application.  In any
event, that sentence is no longer the law as is made clear by the decision
of
the Court of Appeal in <b>Constantinidis v JGL Trading Pty Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2017%20ACSR%20625" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 17
ACSR 625</a>, 636, adopting the propositions made in <b>Re McLennan Holdings Pty
Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%207%20ACLR%20732" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 7 ACLR 732</a>, 737.  One of the propositions approved was "A
provisional liquidator is not automatically appointed by the court for the mere
asking
... even when the company presents its own petition."
<P>

23	As the Court of Appeal said in <b>Constantinidis' case</b>, the appointment
of a provisional liquidator is a drastic intrusion in the affairs of the
company and the taking of the step must
be made with serious consideration.
Ordinarily, it is necessary to establish that the assets of the company are in
some degree of
jeopardy;  see the 3rd edition of McPherson <b>Law of Company
Liquidation </b>(Law Book Company, Sydney, 1987) p 100, though this is only a
rule of thumb.  As was said in <b>Re McLennan Holdings Pty Ltd </b>at p 738 and
affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <b>Constantinidis</b>, the power to appoint
a provisional liquidator is by no means limited, the grounds on which a
provisional liquidator may be appointed
are infinite, and all that really has
to be shown is that there is a bona fide application constituting sufficient
ground for the
making of the order.
<P>

24	In the instant case there is sufficient ground.  The material before me
suggests that unless something is done in Australia the
Australian assets may
be in jeopardy and there are considerable Australian assets over $100 million.
Furthermore, the attitude of
the court in the country of incorporation,
Bermuda, shows that that court is very anxious about these matters and that is
why the
letter of request has issued.  In addition concern has also been
expressed by the courts in New York and London.
<P>

25	Accordingly, I am of the view that this is a proper case where a provisional
liquidator should be appointed to each company.
 I will make the orders in
accordance with the draft proffered by counsel in each case and stand the
applications to wind up to the
Registrar's list at 11 am on 7 June 1999.
<P>
