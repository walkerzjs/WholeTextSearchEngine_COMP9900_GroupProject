<P>

DECISION: 
<P>

See paragraph 43
<P>

JUDGMENT: 
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b> These interests proceed under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</i>
1982</a>. By summons filed on 20 October 1997 the plaintiff Eva Grace Gwynne seeks
an order for provision for her maintenance and advancement
in life out of the
estate of her late husband William Henry Gwynne (to whom I shall refer as "the
deceased").
<P>

2	The deceased died on 5 May 1996 aged 85. He left a will dated 15 January
1985, Probate whereof was on 30 December 1996 granted
to the Public Trustee,
the executor named in such will (who is the defendant to the present
proceedings).
<P>

3	The only significant asset in the estate of the deceased is a house property
situate at 22 Hopewood Crescent, Fairy Meadow (which
is in the vicinity of
Wollongong). That house property has a stated present value of $220,000.
There is a present liability in the
estate in an amount of $6793 which is still
outstanding. The only other asset in the estate, totalling about $2,000, will
be more
than exhausted in meeting that liability.
<P>

4	In addition, each of the parties has provided a statement of the costs of the
present proceedings, since the defendant executor
will, in any event, be
entitled to his costs out of the estate of the deceased and the plaintiff, in
the event that she be successful
in her claim, will also be entitled to an
order for costs out of the estate.
<P>

5	The solicitor for the plaintiff has estimated that the costs of the plaintiff
of the proceedings will total just over $20,000,
and the solicitor for the
defendant that the costs of the defendant will total $15,200.
<P>

6	In addition, if the house property were to be sold the defendant executor
would be entitled to commission on that sale, which
if the sale price were
$220,000 would be in an amount of $7,400. Also, in the event that the house
property were to be sold there
would doubtless also be estate agent's
commission and legal costs upon the sale.
<P>

7	The plaintiff (who was born on 4 May 1918 and who is presently aged almost 81
years) was the second wife of the deceased. The
plaintiff herself had also
previously been married and had two children by her first marriage. The
plaintiffs's first husband died
in 1967. The plaintiff and the deceased married
on 11 October 1969. The deceased had married his first wife in 1931.  Of the
deceased's
first marriage were born two sons William Thomas (who was born on 20
December 1937 and who is now aged 61 years) and Wayne Henry
(who was born on 28
August 1950 and who is now aged 48 years). No children were born to the
marriage of the plaintiff and the deceased.
<P>

8	The plaintiff brought into that marriage certain assets. The precise nature
of those assets has been disputed between the parties.
However, according to
the plaintiff she contributed the sum of about $16,000 towards the marriage.
She also at the time had a motor
vehicle and various items of furniture and
household effects which she brought to the matrimonial home (which had been
purchased
by the deceased and his first wife in about 1964).
<P>

9	That house property, at 22 Hopewood Crescent, was therefore no more than six
years old at the time of the marriage of the plaintiff
to the deceased and at
the time when the plaintiff moved into residence.
<P>

10	Apparently the house property contains a separate flat as part of its
accommodation. That flat has been rented out for some time
and has been
continuously producing income since the death of the deceased.  At present it
is producing an income of $80 a week.
<P>

11	The deceased retired from employment in 1980. He suffered a cerebral
haemorrhage in 1981 and thereafter his health deteriorated.
 He suffered a
second cerebral haemorrhage in 1984 and a third and more serious cerebral
haemorrhage on 26 December 1988. Until February
1989 the plaintiff looked after
and nursed the deceased in their residence. However in February 1989 the
deceased was admitted to
Unanderra Nursing Home. In August 1994 the Protective
Commissioner was appointed manager of the estate of the deceased.
<P>

12	The plaintiff suffered an injury to her right wrist in May 1995, which
eventually resulted in her receiving a compensation payment
in respect of that
injury in a net amount of $19,500. The plaintiff, despite undergoing surgery,
still suffers from weakness in her
right hand.
<P>

13	Under the terms of will of the deceased the plaintiff is given certain
assets (described in clause 5) and then (by clause 6)
is given a right of
residence in the house property at 22 Hopewood Crescent. That right of
residence is subject to the plaintiff
paying all outgoings upon the property
including the cost of repairs.
<P>

14	The will then provides that upon the request by the plaintiff the Public
Trustee may sell the house property and do one of two
things --- either hold
the proceeds of the sale upon trust, as to corpus for the residuary
beneficiaries, and as to income for the
plaintiff; or, if requested so to do by
the plaintiff, purchase a substitutionary residence for her, which the Public
Trustee shall
hold on the same trust as the present house property. That is,
the effect of clause 6 of the will concerning the right of residence
of the
plaintiff is along the same lines as what is sometimes referred to as a Crisp
order (an order of the nature of that made in
<i>Crisp v Burnfield Trust
Company Limited</i>, (Holland J, 18 December 1979, unreported).
<P>

15	There was evidence given from the plaintiff herself and  on her behalf
concerning the need for certain repairs to the house property.
 An affidavit of
Paul James Gwynne Griffiths sets forth a statement of the repairs and
renovations required to that house property,
the total cost of which is
$50,900.
<P>

16	The residuary beneficiaries named in the will of the deceased are the two
sons of the deceased, William Thomas Gwynne and Wayne
Henry Gwynne. Evidence
has been placed before the Court by each of those gentlemen concerning his
financial and material circumstances.
<P>

17	The plaintiff as the widow of the deceased is an eligible person within
paragraph (a) of the definition of that phrase contained
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6</a> (1) of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. As such she has the standing to bring the
present proceedings.  Each of the residuary beneficiaries as a child of the
deceased is
also an eligible person, within paragraph (b) of that
definition.
<P>

18	It is submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the present accommodation of
the plaintiff in the house property at Hopewood
Crescent is not suitable or
satisfactory to her present needs.  It is submitted on her behalf that she is
entitled to receive from
the estate of the deceased an order which will give to
her both security and flexibility in her accommodation and that the effect
of
such an order should be that she should receive that house property
absolutely.
<P>

19	Because of the size of the estate and the assets which comprise the estate,
any order which would give to the plaintiff the house
property absolutely would
need to be an order which would, in effect, give to her the entirety of the
estate absolutely. I have already
referred to the estimated costs of the
present proceedings. The Public Trustee would be entitled, in any event,
whether or not it
be at the request of the plaintiff, to sell the house
property in order to meet his costs of the present proceedings.
<P>

20	Further, I have already referred to an outstanding liability of the estate
(being a claim by Mr William Gwynne in respect of
certain unpaid medical costs
and legal fees).  He apparently has not been pressing for payment of those
costs to the present time,
but he is entitled to receive them out of any assets
which might become available.
<P>

21	There is a further matter relevant to the financial situation of the estate
and to the financial and material circumstances of
the plaintiff. I have
already averted to the fact that a separate flat in the house property has been
rented out and has been producing
a rent of $80 a week since the death of the
deceased.  That sum has been retained by the plaintiff. The house property
belonged to
the deceased alone. By his will he gave to the plaintiff only a
right of residence in that house property.  He certainly did not
give her a
right to any income derived from renting out part of the house property.
<P>

22	The plaintiff has no legal right to retain the amount of $80 a week which
she has been receiving by way of rental since the death
of her husband.
Nevertheless, the Public Trustee has sought and obtained from the residuary
beneficiaries their instructions that
they do to not  propose to seek to
recover from the plaintiff the rental which has been received in respect of
that flat from the
death of the deceased, now almost three years ago. Neither
do the beneficiaries propose to prevent the plaintiff from continuing
to
receive that amount of $80 a week from the rental of the flat whilst she
remains in the house property.  Under the strict provisions
of the terms of the
will that amount of $80 a week should go to the residuary beneficiaries.
<P>

23	The plaintiff's present income consists of her Age Pension of $189 a week,
interest from investments of $30 a week and the rental
income from the flat of
$80 a week --- totalling $303 a week.  Her savings, which consist essentially
of the proceeds of the award
which she received for compensation as a result of
the injury to her wrist, total $30,000.  She has no liabilities.
<P>

24	In her most recent affidavit, of 24 November 1998, the plaintiff states her
weekly expenses and outgoings at a total of $275.50.
 However, it will be
appreciated that if she were to move to some other residence her weekly income
would be reduced by the amount
of the rental from the flat, that is by $80, and
her weekly income would thus be only $223.  By the same token, however, her
expenses
would be reduced by an estimated amount of $20 a week, to a total of
$255.50.
<P>

25	The plaintiff presently owns and drives a motor car. Nevertheless, depending
upon whether she might live in the Wollongong area,
she would be prepared to
forgo the motor vehicle and to travel by public transport if she no longer had
a motor vehicle.  Her weekly
expenses would then be reduced by an estimated
$37. But even making those adjustments, the statement of expenses of the
plaintiff
would still be slightly higher than her weekly income without the
rental from the flat.
<P>

26	Of claims by widows, and especially widows whose marriages have, like that
of the plaintiff in the instant occasion been of a
considerable duration ---
here the plaintiff was married to the deceased for a period of almost 27 years
---it has been said that,
to the extent that the assets of the estate enable
him so to do, a husband should provide for his widow in such a way that she
will
be secure in her accommodation, that she will be able to live at a
standard no less than that which she enjoyed during the life time
of her
husband and that she will have a fund to meet any contingencies.
<P>

27	In the instant case the deceased by his will clearly gave consideration to
providing security of accommodation for the plaintiff.
It was not his fault
that the size of the estate was not larger. There is nothing beyond the house
property which can provide any
funds for the plaintiff to live at a standard no
less than that which she enjoyed during the lifetime of her husband, or from
which
to meet any contingencies.
<P>

28	It has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that she should receive the
entirety of the estate of the deceased. That is,
that she have the house
property absolutely. In the event that she were to receive that house property,
then it would appear that
it is her intention to sell it and to acquire another
residence.
<P>

29	Evidence has been placed before the Court of the costs of various home
units, one bedroom and two bedroom, in the Wollongong
area.  The prices of the
one bedroom units range between about $80,000 and $112,500, whilst the prices
of the two bedroom units range
between $114,500 and about $150,000.
<P>

30	I have already averted to the fact that if the house property were sold the
liability of the estate would need to be paid from
the net proceeds of sale
and, in addition, the costs of the present proceedings would also need to be
paid before any amount were
to become available for the purchase of another
residence for the plaintiff --- be it under the terms of will, or in
consequence
of any order which might give to the plaintiff that property
absolutely. There would certainly be sufficient funds in the estate,
even after
payment of all those costs and expenses, to purchase a home unit costing about
$150,000 and there still would be some
relatively small amount remaining. Under
the terms of the will the corpus of any such remaining amount would be held for
the residuary
beneficiaries and the income would go to the plaintiff.
<P>

31	The plaintiff has not placed before the Court any evidence to show she would
be assisted in her maintenance and in her life-style
by receiving the house
property absolutely rather than if the provisions of the will concerning the
acquisition for her of one, or
sequentially a series of, substitutionary
residences were to remain in force. Were she to receive the house property
absolutely,
then the effect of such an order would deprive the residuary
beneficiaries of any practical benefit under the terms of their father's
will.
<P>

32	The Court in approaching the claims of the plaintiff must also consider the
competing claims of the two residuary beneficiaries.
The evidence concerning
the financial and material circumstances of those beneficiaries, and in
particular of William Thomas Gwynne,
is by no means complete.  Nevertheless,
each of those beneficiaries is in a position where he would benefit
considerably by having
additional assets come to him from the estate of his
late father.
<P>

33	Mr William Gwynne has retired and is living on his superannuation, as also
is his wife. The Court has not been told the amount
of the superannuation of Mr
William Gwynne. However, apart from living expenses they keep their finances
separate.
<P>

34	Mr Wayne Gwynne is presently unemployed. Nevertheless he hopes shortly to do
some building work, at least on a part-time basis.
He and his wife are living
on his wife's income, which is not sufficient to support both of them.
<P>

35	It seems to me, in approaching the claim of the plaintiff, in the light of
the competing claims of the two beneficiaries, that
those two beneficiaries
should not be deprived entirely of an interest in the estate of their late
father.
<P>

36	I have reached the conclusion that the provisions of the will concerning the
acquisition of the substitutionary residences for
the plaintiff should be
allowed to remain in force, but that upon the sale of the present residence or
of any future substitutionary
residence the plaintiff should be entitled to
receive any difference between the sale price of the one and the purchase price
of
the other.
<P>

37	Thus, the plaintiff will be enabled to increase somewhat her capital funds.
I do not see how awarding to the plaintiff absolutely
the house property will
in fact benefit her maintenance or her life-style. But an order along the lines
which I have indicated will
give to her some additional funds to meet
contingencies.
<P>

38	(In response to the Master the parties agreed that there should be the usual
order for costs) 
<P>

39	(The Master requested counsel to prepare short minutes to give effect to his
decision, including an order that the costs of the
plaintiff on the party and
party basis and the costs of the defendant on the indemnity basis be paid out
of the assets of the estate.)
<P>

40	LUNCHEON ADJOURNMENT
<P>

41	(Short minutes of order handed up.  The Master amended paragraph 2 of the
short minutes by inserting the phrase "on the party
and party basis" after "the
plaintiff's costs", so that it read "the plaintiffs's costs on the party and
party basis be paid out
of the estate of the late William Henry Gwynne."   
<P>

42	For discussion on substitutionary residence see separate transcript).
<P>

43	The formal order which I make in this matter is, 
<P>

	I make orders as in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 in the Short Minutes of Order dated
22 February 1999, initialled by me and filed in Court
this day.
