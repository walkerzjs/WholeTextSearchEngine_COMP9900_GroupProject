1   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 65(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a> </i>("the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>")
authorises this Court, where satisfied that a person has engaged, or is
proposing to engage, in conduct, inter alia, that constitutes
or would
constitute a contravention of a provision of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, to grant an
injunction in such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate.  Sub s (2),
while expressly not limiting the generality

2   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 42</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 46</a> are both provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5.</a>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 42(1)</a>
provides:
<P>

"A person shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading
or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive."
<P>

3   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">S 46</a> provides:
<P>

"A person shall not, in relation to employment that is to be, or may be,
offered by the person or by another person, engage in conduct
that is liable to
mislead persons seeking the employment as to the availability, nature, terms or
conditions of, or any other matter
relating to, the employment."
<P>

4   	By summons filed on 26 November 1999 the plaintiff, the
Director General of the Department of Fair Trading ("the Director General"),
claims orders, both final and interlocutory, restraining the defendant, Kevin
John Sims:
<P>

"(i)	From engaging ... in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or that is
likely to mislead or deceive by selling, offering for
sale, providing or
advertising any goods or services so as to mislead members of the public into
believing that -
<P>

(a)	the defendant is a model agent, casting agent or employment agent;
<P>

(b)	the goods or services are goods or services sold or provided by a modelling
agency, casting agency or employment agency;  or
<P>

(c)	the goods or services are otherwise connected with modelling, acting or
entertainment work.
<P>

(ii)	... from engaging in conduct in relation to employment that is to be or
may be offered by the defendant or by another person
that is liable to mislead
members of the public seeking the employment as to - 
<P>

(a)	the availability or the extent of the employment;
<P>

(b)	whether they have been accepted or chosen for any such employment;
<P>

or
<P>

(c)	the need in order to obtain any such employment to be first registered with
the defendant or to be entered into a catalogue,
magazine or computer or to
have a photographic portfolio, folder or album or a video prepared by the
defendant.
<P>

(iii)	... from carrying on a business of supplying goods or services as a model
agent or employment agent for such period as to
the court may seem proper."
<P>

In the present application, the Director General seeks orders on an
interlocutory basis only.
<P>

5   	As a pre-requisite to the grant of an injunction it is
necessary that the Director General establish that the defendant has
engaged,
or is proposing to engage, in conduct that constitutes or would constitute a
contravention of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 46</a>, or both.  In order to discharge that onus, the
Director General relies on a number of affidavits.
<P>

6   	Firstly, he has tendered evidence of a certificate under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s157.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
157</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a></i> establishing that, on 1 November 1999 the
defendant was convicted in the Downing Centre Local Court on ten charges of
contravention
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 46.</a>  The informations and summonses in respect of which the
defendant was convicted contained particulars of the allegations made against
him.  A sample of the allegations will suffice for present purposes.  For
example, in relation to the first charge, it was alleged
that on 27 February
1998 the defendant placed an advertisement in the Brisbane Courier Mail
inviting applications from persons for
"models for film work".  A Mr Mathew
Dendle replied, and was advised by the defendant that his application had been
accepted and
it would be necessary for Mr Dendle to obtain a modelling
portfolio at a cost of $1,000.  This amount Mr Dendle paid.  Thereafter,
in
various conversations with Mr Dendle the defendant repeatedly represented that
modelling work would be found for Mr Dendle.  This
work never eventuated.
<P>

7   	The other nine charges concerned similar advertisements
placed in a variety of newspapers, advertising the availability of
model, film
or entertainment work, the payment of various sums of money by individuals who
responded to the advertisements, conversations
with the defendant in which he
represented that work would become available, and the failure of such work to
materialise.  In some
cases the respondents sought work for children, and in
one case for pets.
<P>

8   	The charges were heard and the defendant was convicted in
his absence.  I was told, during the course of the present application,
that
the defendant had filed an application pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s100.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 100</a> D of the <i>Justice
Act 1902</i> for annulment of the convictions.  There was no evidence of when
the application might be heard, and no indication of any defence
that the
defendant might propose to mount.  There was evidence that the informations and
summonses had been personally served upon
him and consequently of his awareness
of the date of hearing, but no explanation was given for his non appearance at
the hearing.
<P>

9   	While I am mindful that the convictions were entered in the
defendant's absence, I am satisfied that they provide prima facie
evidence for
a conclusion that he has engaged in conduct of the kind prohibited by s 46.
<P>

10   	There was some additional evidence that points to further
contraventions, and, perhaps more importantly in the light of the
certificate
of conviction, that the defendant proposes to continue the course of conduct of
the kind that resulted in the convictions.
 Again, a sample will suffice.
<P>

11   	Ms Emma White responded to an advertisement she read in
the Central Coast Express Advocate in July 1999 for "film extras and
star
types".  She expressed interest, and, having received documents from an
organisation that called itself "Central Casting", on
2 August she sent the sum
of money requested, $177.  By 16 August, having heard nothing from the agency
since sending the money,
she telephoned and eventually spoke to a person who
identified himself as Kevin Sims.  On the evidence I am satisfied that this was
the defendant.  There were subsequent conversations in which Ms White
eventually asked for a refund of her money but this was refused.
 The defendant
claimed that "two things" had been sent to her through the mail but she had not
received these.  On 9 October Ms White
received a message from the defendant to
the effect that he had a "photo shoot" ready for the following Saturday, and
asking her
to return his call.   Ms White had not heard from the defendant
since.  It is a reasonable inference from this affidavit that Ms
White did not
return the call as requested.
<P>

12   	Ms Michelle Eden responded to an advertisement her husband
initially read in the Gold Coast Bulletin.  She was seeking modelling
work for
her five year old son.   She sent photographs of the child and received a
telephone call from a male who identified himself
as Kevin Jay from Central
Castings.  She had a number of conversations with this man, during which he
suggested that work would be
available for the child.  On 21 October she
accordingly, at his request, deposited $295 in a bank account he nominated.
Having heard
nothing thereafter, on 31 October she telephoned, but was told
that it was too soon, and that she would be contacted by the agency.
 On 4
November the man telephoned her husband and told him not to contact the agency,
and that it was still too soon for any result.
<P>

13   	On 7 August 1999 Ms Wendy Craw read an advertisement in
the Sydney Morning Herald asking for film extras.  She responded by
sending
photographs and resumes.  On 28 August she received a form letter advising:
<P>

"You have been unanimously approved and selected to join our brilliant new
casting consultancy and agency.  This new agency we feel
will be highly
exciting and highly lucrative to all participators.  In addition to the film
extras and atmosphere people we have
also listed you as a possibility for
appearing in television commercials, magazines and newspaper ads, TV
productions, store fashion
shows and in fact all facets of the highly
interesting industry where people are used in ads and promotions, group scenes
and live
productions.  This work is highly lucrative, great to participate in
and great for the self esteem.  You never know what it could
lead to for
you.
<P>

...
<P>

There is a subsidy fee payable to the agency.  This fee is a modest $177 easily
recoverable dollars.  In a lot of instances this
will be tax deductible - check
with your accountant or local tax office.  It is usually regarded as money
spent in order to gain
a secondary occupation."
<P>

14   	On 3 September, after a telephone conversation with the
defendant, Ms Craw deposited the sum of $177 into a bank account nominated
by
him.  On 18 September Ms Craw telephoned the defendant but made contact only
with an answering machine on which she recorded a
message asking the defendant
to return her call.  On 10 October she telephoned again, and heard a different
recorded message.  On
31 October she telephoned again but on this occasion the
telephone number had been disconnected.  
<P>

15   	A number of other deponents provided affidavit evidence to
the effect that they read advertisements of similar kind in different
newspapers published in NSW and Queensland.  Only the three deponents already
mentioned actually paid money, and these are, in my
view, taken alone, a
fragile foundation for a conclusion that the defendant's conduct was in fact
misleading or deceptive.  That
is because of the particular dates on which
money was paid, and the relatively short time that has elapsed, even now, since
those
payments.  It should not be assumed that provision of suitable work of
the kind sought would be instantaneous.  It would, in my opinion,
be reasonable
to allow a longer time in an industry of the kind here in question.  However,
the evidence of Ms Craw that by 31 October
the telephone was disconnected does
strengthen such a conclusion.  When that fact is put together with the evidence
of the convictions
in November it is adequate to establish that the defendant
has engaged in conduct of the kind that is a pre-requisite to the grant
of
injunctive relief.  Moreover, the evidence of these three deponents, and the
others, all to the effect that advertisements of
the same kind have been
placed, are amply sufficient to establish that the defendant is continuing to
place advertisements, to solicit
money, and to make representations concerning
the availability of work for those who respond to the advertisements and pay
the required
sums of money.  I am satisfied that he is not in a position to, or
does not intend to, fulfil the obligations he undertakes.  I am
therefore also
satisfied that he proposes to engage in conduct that contravenes the relevant
Part of the Act.
<P>

16   	Further, there was evidence that officers of the
Department of Fair Trading believe that the "Kevin Jay" to whom Ms Eden spoke,
was in fact the defendant, Kevin Sims.  Once again, that belief alone would be
inadequate to establish the fact, but the name of
the agency mentioned,
"Central Casting" given to both Ms Eden and Ms White is sufficient to establish
at least the relevant link
with the defendant.  
<P>

17   	The defendant, although present throughout the hearing of
this application, neither gave nor adduced evidence.  While his
silence cannot
be used to plug any gaps in the Director General's case, his decision to take
this course is of some significance.
 This is because his legal representative
asked me to accept from the Bar table that there are many clients on the
defendant's books,
and that, other than those named in the informations in the
Local Court proceedings, or who have sworn affidavits in these proceedings,
they are to be taken as satisfied with the defendant's services.  I decline to
draw any such inference, or to accept that contention
as relayed to me from the
Bar table.
<P>

18   	The Director General relied also on evidence contained in
three affidavits sworn by Ms Jane Gibson, an investigator in the
Department Of
Fair Trading.  Her evidence went to a number of relevant aspects.  She gave
evidence that, on 1 December 1998, a notice
under s 20(2) of the Act was
forwarded to the defendant, requiring him to produce specified documents by 11
December 1998.
<P>

19   	S 20(2) relevantly authorises an investigator to require a
person whom the Director General, on reasonable grounds, believes
to be capable
of giving information, producing documents or giving evidence in relation to a
possible contravention of the Act, to
give such information or produce such
documents to the investigator.  As at 25 November 1999, when Ms Gibson swore
her affidavit,
the defendant had failed to comply with the notice.  No
explanation for the failure was forthcoming.
<P>

20   	Ms Gibson also deposed to attempts she had made, during
1998, to contact the defendant.  On 20 October 1998 she had two telephone
conversations with him.  He declined, he said on legal advice, to meet officers
of the Department and declined to provide details
of his "contacts in the
industry", even after an express undertaking of confidentiality had been given
to him.  He said he, at that
time, had no business premises, that he
anticipated having an office in the new Fox Studios at Moore Park, that he was
running a
legitimate business, that he had found God and was an honest person
trying to do the right thing.
<P>

21   	The following day the defendant telephoned Ms Gibson to
say that, after discussion with his lawyer, he would like the questions
she
proposed to ask forwarded to him before he would consider whether to
participate in a meeting.  Over the following weeks a number
of telephone
conversations took place, the details of which it is unnecessary to relate.
<P>

22   	On 16 February 1999 the defendant did meet Ms Gibson and a
senior investigator, Mr Laughton.  A comprehensive account of the
conversation
is contained in Ms Gibson's affidavit.  When asked why he had failed to respond
to the s 20 notice he claimed that privacy
laws prevented him from giving
details of clients, and otherwise declined, citing legal advice, to discuss
that matter further. 
In a subsequent telephone conversation, on 9 June 1999,
he said that he was in the process of organising "some strong financial
backing"
(further details of which he refused to divulge) and asked for
information about individuals who had sought a refund of money paid.
 He
refused, however, to guarantee refunds, saying that decision was one for "the
Board" (otherwise unidentified).  He again declined
to provide any other
information about his business.  He gave a mobile telephone number and a post
office box as contact points.
<P>

23   	Finally Ms Gibson annexed part of a transcript of criminal
proceedings against the defendant before the Downing Centre Local
Court on 16
September 1999.  The precise nature of the proceedings does not clearly emerge
from the extract provided, which is limited
to cross-examination of the
defendant.  The transcript is relied upon in relation only to questions and
answers concerning the defendant's
personal and/or business addresses.  It is
sufficient to note that, at best, the defendant's answers might reasonably be
categorised
as evasive.  He said, for example, that he traded under his own
name as Central Casting, and that the office was registered in Pitt
Street, but
he could not or would not disclose the number, saying "it's a new
registration".  He said that the registered office
address was nothing more
than a post office box.  When asked about his residential address he said that
he had been staying in a
beach house in Terrigal but he did not know its
address.
<P>

24   	In the circumstances I am satisfied that the defendant
placed numerous advertisements soliciting applications for work in
the film,
modelling and entertainment industries, and has sought and received payments of
sums of money from various individuals
who responded to those advertisements.
I am satisfied that he has failed to make such work available and that he is
not in a position
to do so.   I am therefore satisfied that he has contravened
both s 42 and s 46 of the Act.  Moreover, I am satisfied that, absent
the issue
of an injunction restraining him from doing so, he will continue to engage in
such conduct.  Of particular relevance in
this regard is evidence that the
defendant has previously been restrained by a similar injunction from engaging
in similar conduct.
 In 1992 Studdert J made orders restraining the defendant
from carrying on a business of supplying goods or services as a model agent,
casting agent, advertising agent or employment agent.  He also ordered the
defendant to pay almost $3,000 to the Director General
for payment to various
claimants in that case.  There was evidence before me that, again acting on
legal advice, the defendant had
not paid that money.
<P>

25   	The injunction granted by Studdert J was granted on 25
March 1992, and to be in force for a period of five years.  Accordingly,
it
expired on 24 March 1997.  By 1998, on the evidence before me, the defendant
was again actively engaged in conduct of the same
or a similar kind and had
come under adverse notice in relation to his business practices.  That fact
alone, and also taken together
with the other evidence to which I have
referred, satisfies me that he is proposing to engage in conduct that would
constitute a
contravention of provisions of Pt 5 of the Act.
<P>

26   	Accordingly, it is appropriate to make orders in the terms
sought.  The specific orders I make are:
<P>

Until further order of the Court:
<P>

1.	the defendant by himself or his servants or agents be restrained from
engaging in trade or commerce in conduct that is misleading
or deceptive or
that is likely to mislead or deceive by selling, offering for sale, providing
or advertising any goods or services
so as to mislead members of the public
that -
<P>

	(a)	the defendant is a model agent, casting agent, or employment agent;
<P>

	(b)	the goods or services are goods or services sold or provided by a
modelling agency, casting agency or employment agency;  or
<P>

	(c)	the goods or services are otherwise connected with modelling or acting or
entertainment work;
<P>

2.	the defendant by himself or his servants or agents be restrained from
engaging in conduct in relation to employment that is to
be or may be offered
by the defendant or by another person that is liable to mislead members of the
public seeking the employment
as to -
<P>

	(a)	the availability or extent of the employment;
<P>

	(b)	whether they have been accepted or chosen for any such employment;
<P>

	(c)	the need in order to obtain any such employment to be first registered
with the defendant or to be entered into a catalogue,
magazine or computer or
to have a photographic portfolio, folder or album or video prepared by the
defendant;
<P>

3.	the defendant by himself or his servants or agents be restrained from
carrying on a business of supplying goods or services as
a model agent or
employment agent.
<P>

27   	It will be necessary for the parties to make arrangements
for the matter to be brought back before the Court in relation to
the Director
General's claim for final orders.   The parties are to make the necessary
arrangements.
