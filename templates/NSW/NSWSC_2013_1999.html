<p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='1' value="1">By
application filed on 25 June 2013, the plaintiff, Mr John Kukulovski, as
liquidator of Waterfront Investments Group Pty Limited
(in liq) ("Company")
initially sought orders under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588ff.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 588FF(3)(b)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporations Act</i>
2001</a> (Cth) that the period within which an application may be brought against
certain persons under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588fb.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 588FB</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588fda.html" class="autolink_findacts">588FDA</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588ff.html" class="autolink_findacts">588FF</a> and any other sections in
respect of voidable transactions be 12 July 2014. The named persons in respect
of whom that order is sought
are (1) Eddy Investments (NSW) Pty Limited ("Eddy
Investments"); (2) Mr Edward Ahmajani; (3) NJ Investments (Aust) Pty Limited
("NJ
Investments"); (4) Mrs Nicole Jammal; (5) Platnum Corporation Pty Limited
("Platnum") and (6) Mr Samir Jammal. An order was also
sought extending the
time, for the same period, in respect of the same sections and any other
sections in respect of voidable transactions
against such other persons as may
be identified by the liquidator in his investigations of the financial affairs
of the Company.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='2' value="2">By
the time the liquidator filed written submissions in the proceedings, he had
indicated that the extension sought would be reduced
to 6 months. By the time of
the hearing before me, agreement had been reached between the liquidator and six
entities against whom
the extension of time to bring proceedings was sought that
an order could be made, by consent, extending the time for the commencement
of
the relevant proceedings to 23 December 2013; a period of little less than three
months. Plainly, so far as the grant of orders
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588ff.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 588FF</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporations Act</a></i> involves an exercise of the Court's discretion, and so
far as the order sought also extends to unnamed third parties, it is necessary
for the Court to be satisfied that the order is properly made, although the
consent of the six parties directly affected by it is
a matter to be taken into
account in forming that view. </li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='3' value="3">I
should briefly refer to the relevant provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporations Act</a></i>
which are the subject of this application. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588fb.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 588FB</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporations
Act</a></i> deals with the circumstances in which a transaction of a company in
winding up is an uncommercial transaction (as defined) which
involves
consideration, on the one hand, of the benefits to the company of entering into
the transaction and, on the other hand,
the detriments to the company of
entering into the transaction and benefits to other parties to the transaction
of entering into
it and any other relevant matter. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588fda.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 588FDA</a> deals with the
making of orders in respect of unreasonable director-related transactions of a
company, as defined. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588ff.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 588FF(1)</a> provides for the Court to make orders, on
the application of a company's liquidator, if it is satisfied that a transaction
of the
company is voidable because of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588fe.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 588FE</a>, which in turn permits the
making of orders in respect of voidable transactions, including, relevantly,
uncommercial transactions
and unreasonable director-related transactions of the
company. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588ff.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 588FF(3)(a)</a> in turn provides that an application for the Court
to make such an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588ff.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 588FF(1)</a> may only be made during the period
beginning on the relation-back day and ending three years after the
relation-back day, or 12 months
after the first appointment of a liquidator in
relation to the winding of the company, whichever is the later. The first of
those
specified periods is relevant in the present case. Such an order may also
be made, relevantly, within such longer period as the Court
orders on an
application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588ff.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 588FF(3)(b)</a> made by the liquidator during, relevantly,
the three-year period specified in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588ff.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 588FF(3)(a).</a> In the present case, the
application was made, as I noted above, on 25 June 2013, which is within the
three-year period after the
relation-back day, where the liquidator was
appointed on 13 July 2010. </li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='4' value="4">The
application is supported by two affidavits of the liquidator dated 19 June 2013
and 1 October 2013 respectively. The liquidator's
evidence is that he was
appointed by resolution of the Company's creditors passed at a meeting on 13
July 2010 under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s497.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 497</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporations Act</a></i>, which deals with a
meeting of creditors after the company has passed a resolution for its voluntary
winding up. His evidence is
that the Company's principal asset was a mixed use
property development, comprising residential units and commercial property, at
The Entrance, New South Wales. He identifies two transactions which may
potentially be the subject of proceedings, for which the
extension of time is
now sought, namely a purchase by NJ Investments of Unit 11 in that property for
a stated purchase price of $900,000,
and a purchase by Eddy Investments of the
commercial premises in that property for a stated purchase price of $2.9
million. He notes
that the sole director of NJ Investments is Mrs Nicole Jammal,
the wife of the Company's former director, Mr Samir Jammal, and the
sole
director of Eddy Investments is Mr Edward Ahmajani, who is Mr Samir Jammal's
nephew. He notes that the settlement instructions
in respect of the purchase of
that commercial property provided for a payment to, another entity, Platnum of
an amount in the order
of $130,647 at settlement, and the sole director of that
company is also Mrs Nicole Jammal. </li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='5' value="5">The
liquidator's affidavit sets out the steps taken in the conduct of the voluntary
liquidation since his appointment on 13 July 2010
and, specifically, steps taken
to seek to obtain copies of Company's books and records since that date
including its financial records.
His evidence is that he has received only
minimal books and records of the Company, in the course of public examinations
in April
2013, and has not obtained the company's financial records or books of
prime entry such as cash books. It appears that the liquidator
has now obtained
further complete copies of contracts in respect of the relevant transactions,
since the date on which his first
affidavit was sworn. He also refers to his
efforts to obtain funding to carry out detailed investigations into the
Company's financial
affairs, including reaching an agreement in respect of
examinations and the costs of this application with a funding creditor, pursuant
to approval given by the Company's creditors generally. </li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='6' value="6">The
liquidator notes that public examinations were conducted, initially on 11 April
2013, but only Mr Samir Jammal was examined on
that first date and the
examination of two other examinees, Mrs Nicole Jammal and Mr Edward Ahmajani,
were adjourned for medical
reasons to 10 May 2013 and ultimately took place on
17 July 2013. It will be noted that the date of those examinations was after
the
three-year period specified in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588ff.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 588FF</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporations Act</a></i> so
that, if it is accepted that the information which might be available on those
examinations is relevant, as it might well be,
to the liquidator's decision
whether to commence proceedings and his ability to fund them, then some
extension of the time in which
the proceedings would be commenced would be
likely to be necessary. </li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='7' value="7">The
liquidator also draws attention to certain matters which have come to his
attention, again apparently in the course of this year,
in respect of aspects of
the relevant transactions. It appears that, so far as Unit 11 was sold to NJ
Investments, the contract price
of $900,000 was contracted to be paid in an
amount of $400,759.52 by "BBX dollars", a form of barter currency and, as I have
noted
above, an amount of $130,647 of the purchase price payable at the
settlement was paid to Platnum. The liquidator notes that he has
not sighted any
books or records to explain why that payment was made, or whether it was paid,
on settlement. </li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='8' value="8">It
also appears to be common ground between the parties that the amount of
$400,759.52 payable by "BBX dollars" was not in fact paid,
although the Company
transferred title to the unit to NJ Investments without having received that
payment. That position is made
clear because NJ Investments has commenced
proceedings against the Company which seek declarations that, inter alia, a
payment of
$500,000 was made on its behalf in respect of the purchase of unit 11
and that its only remaining obligation owed (I interpolate,
some three years
after the purchase took place) in respect of that contract is to pay or deliver
the amount of $400,760 in BBX dollars.
</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='9' value="9">The
liquidator in turn gives evidence of matters in respect of the transfer of the
commercial premises to Eddy Investments, for a
stated purchase price of $2.9
million, which involved a cash component of $1.6 million and a BBX dollars
component of $1.3 million.
He notes that a purported payment recorded in the
Company's BBX dollars account of $1.5 million on 18 March 2010 was apparently
reversed
by a debit of $1.5 million on 11 June 2010. He also refers to evidence
given by Mr Samir Jammal, in his public examination, that
the commercial
premises are currently occupied by companies controlled by Mr Jammal and his
wife who operate restaurants from those
premises. He also refers to certain
aspects of the settlement instructions given in respect of that sale, including
that the Company
itself appears to have received no funds from the sale, and
that there is a notation on the settlement instructions for the balance
of funds
to be paid to the purchaser, Eddy Investments.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='10' value="10">As
I noted above, the application for an extension of time to 23 December 2013 is
now consented to, so far as the named defendants
are concerned. By his updating
affidavit dated 1 October 2013, the liquidator notes that it is no longer
necessary to resume public
examinations in the period of that extension, because
the examinations of Ms Jammal and Mr Ahmajani took place on 17 July 2013, but
that he seeks the extension of time to complete analysis of documents and obtain
legal advice and give further consideration to the
merits of the proceedings;
that he intends to complete analysis of evidence relating to the source and
application of funds relating
to the sale of the relevant premises; and that he
will also explore the availability of funding to pursue actions in relation to
the relevant transaction. He expresses the view that he anticipates those tasks
would take some six months to complete; I infer,
because of the consent position
now reached between the liquidator and the named defendants, that he has formed
the view that those
tasks may be completed more quickly, within the period of a
little less than three months that is now sought by way of extension.

question namely whether it is "fair and just in all of the circumstances" to
grant the relevant
extension, having regard to, on the one hand, the
liquidator's explanation for delay and, on the other, the prejudice the
defendant
would suffer as a result of the extension. In <i>New Cap Reinsurance

White J observed that the matters raised in such an application would ordinarily
include any explanation for the delay in bringing
the proceedings; a preliminary
review of the merits of the foreshadowed proceedings, directed to whether they
were so devoid of prospects
that it would be unfair, by granting an extension,
to expose the other party to the continuing prospect of suit; and whether the
likely or actual prejudice resulting from the grant of the extension was
sufficient substantially to outweigh the case for granting
an extension. His
Honour also noted that, where the liquidator's purpose in seeking the extension
of time was to further investigate
to determine whether or not to bring
proceedings, a preliminary enquiry into the merits of any consequent proceedings
may not always
be necessary. That factor is not relevant in the present case,
where the liquidator's investigations appear to be well advanced and
the nature
of the possible proceedings is tolerably clear. </li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='12' value="12">His
Honour's reference to those factors was approved by Barrett J in <i>Arnautovic v

<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='13' value="13">Turning
to the application to these factors in the present case, Mr Sulan draws
attention to the evidence to which I have referred
above as to the liquidator's
explanation for the delay in commencing proceedings. In the present
circumstances, the liquidator provides
limited explanation of what was done in
the early period of the liquidation, but the Court should recognise that
liquidators, particularly
of companies with limited funds, will inevitably face
challenges in balancing, on the one hand, the need for investigation and, on
the
other hand, their ability to fund that investigation and that those challenges
will be exacerbated where, as in the present case,
the liquidators face
difficulty in obtaining access to a company's financial and other records. The
liquidator's evidence is more
expansive as to the latter period, where he makes
clear that there has been, and continues to be, difficulty in obtaining access
to the Company's books and records, which, if they exist, would likely be in the
possession of its former director, who is one of
the proposed defendants to the
proceedings or persons associated with him. The liquidator also points to the
adjournment, without
fault on his part, of the public examinations of Ms Jammal
and Mr Ahmajani, so that they did not take place until after the three
year
period specified in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588ff.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 588FF(3)(a)</a> had elapsed in any event. It seems to me that
these matters are sufficient to provide an explanation for the liquidator's
delay,
particularly in circumstances where, as I will note below, there is no
suggestion that any real prejudice would be suffered by the
potential defendants
by the grant of the short extension which is sought. </li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='14' value="14">The
second relevant factor identified in the case law is at least a preliminary
review of the merits of the relevant proceedings.
That review, in the present
case, should be conducted relatively briefly, where the application is not
opposed, and in circumstances
that the proposed proceedings may well be heard in
this Division. It is sufficient to note that a number of the features of the
relevant
transactions, including the use of BBX trade dollars as a form of
payment in respect of the purchase of unit 11; the long delay in
provision of
that payment, so that it is still outstanding some three years after title to
the relevant property had been delivered;
and the payment on settlement
directed, not to the Company, but to Platnum, all raise the possibility that the
transaction was either
"uncommercial" for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588fb.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 588FB</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporations Act</a></i>. It is also arguable that the transaction was an
unreasonable director-related transaction for the purpose of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588fda.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 588FDA</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporations Act</a></i>, subject to the question, which was not explored in
submissions before me, whether it can be established that the relevant companies
are close associates of a director for the purposes of that section.
</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='15' value="15">So
far as the transfer of the commercial premises to Eddy Investments is concerned,
the substantial proportion of the consideration
that was payable in BBX trade
dollars, the apparent reversal of the payment in BBX trade dollars some period
after it occurred, a
further direction indicating a payment to Platnum, and the
provision for the surplus to be paid to Eddy Investments as purchaser,
all raise
the possibility that a claim may be available under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588fb.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 588FB</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588fda.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 588FDA</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporations Act</a></i>. To put it in another way, it seems to me that there is
no basis to suggest that, in respect of either of the transactions, the
prospects
of the potential proceedings are so poor that it would be unfair to
expose the potential defendants to them to the continuing prospect
of suit,
within the language of White J in <i>New Cap Reinsurance Corp</i> above at [52].
</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='16' value="16">The
final question which arises is one of prejudice. Mr Sulan points out that, and
there seems to me to be substantial force in the
proposition that, the question
of prejudice is of lesser relevance where, at least so far as the named
defendants are concerned,
they consent to an order granting an extension of the
period of some three months that is now sought. To the extent that that question
does arise, it seems to me that the element of prejudice in this matter would be
outweighed by the factors supporting the grant of
an extension. There is,
obviously, in any application for an extension, at least a degree of prejudice,
so far as proceedings may
be brought later, or in the present case may be
brought in circumstances where they otherwise could not be brought within time;
in
<i>Agricultural and Rural Finance Pty Ltd v Kirk</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2011/67.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2011] NSWCA 67</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282011%29%2082%20ACSR%20390" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2011)
82 ACSR 390</a>, Tobias JA referred to a concept of "presumptive prejudice" arising
from delay but also noted that it was a matter which should be
given limited
weight in balancing the various factors to which the court should have regard.
</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='17' value="17">In
the present case, as in <i>Bowcher (liquidator); Re Meares Nominees Pty Ltd (in
liq)</i>, the parties involved appear, to put it broadly, to be related parties
who are likely to have some knowledge of the circumstances
in which the
transaction took place; there is no suggestion that evidence which would have
been available to them has been lost or
destroyed, still less that their
position in respect of available evidence will be worsened by the short
extension of time that is
sought; the difference between proceedings commenced
prior to 13 July 2013 and proceedings commenced by late December 2013 is not
substantial; and the possibility that proceedings may be brought at all, so that
the liquidator has the opportunity to vindicate
the Company's rights and the
defendants have the opportunity to defend those proceedings, should not be
treated as a relevant form
of prejudice. For all these reasons, and particularly
in circumstances where the extension sought is now not opposed by the named
potential defendants, I do not consider that prejudice has been established such
that the extension sought should not be granted.
</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='18' value="18">I
am conscious that an application is also made for an order, in a more general
form, extending the time for such proceedings to allow
them to be brought
against such other persons as may be identified by the liquidator in his
investigations of the financial affairs
of the Company. Mr Sulan points out,
with considerable plausibility, that the persons against whom such action might
be brought,
who might be identified in circumstances such as this, are also most
likely to be related parties, given the nature of the relevant
transactions. The
Court's power to grant such an extension, extending to persons who have not been
specifically identified and named,
is well-established on the authorities. The
extension of time sought in the present case is short, and it seems to me that
the factors
to which I have referred above also support an extension of time in
respect of such other persons. </li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='19' value="19">The
liquidator seeks an order that the costs of his originating process be costs in
the winding up of the Company. It seems to me
that that order is properly made,
since this application was a necessary application in the conduct of the winding
up of the Company.
</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='20' value="20">For
these reasons, I will make orders in accordance with the consent orders which
were signed by the legal representatives of the
parties and are initialled by me
and placed in the file. I note that these orders contemplate that any
proceedings might be commenced
by 23 December 2013. The Court has listed
associated proceedings brought by NJ Investments for directions on 3 February
2013. I will
make a further order granting leave to the liquidator, if it
commences proceedings in respect of the matters subject to this application,
to
have those proceedings listed for directions on the same date. </li></ol><p></p>
