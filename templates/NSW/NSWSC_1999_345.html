<b><u>1291/99 GEKO INTERNET  v  GEKO PTY LIMITED &amp; ORS</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT - on notice of motion to seek specific performance of settlement
agreement.</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:   This is a notice of motion under which the second and third
defendants really, although in not perhaps appropriate
terms, seek an order
that an agreement between them and the plaintiff for the settlement of this
action be specifically performed.
 In other words, what they say is that there
was an agreement for settlement and, therefore, the action ought to be at an
end and
the agreement for settlement should be brought into force.
<P>

2	The matter was before the Court on 18 April 1999 when there was in the list a
motion to vacate the hearing dates for this week.
 That motion was before me.
There were indications that the parties were having discussions.
<P>

3	I made some comment which would at least have given the parties the
impression that I was not keen on adjourning matters which
had been fixed for
hearing some time ago, that if the matter were settled or if it was necessary
to proceed with the motion, then
the parties should come back to court to
inform me and if I was not in court they should contact my associate.   As I
remember it,
I then said that I would come back to court, but as the parties do
not seem to remember that I would not be certain that was said.

<P>

4	In any event, discussions took place between the solicitors for the plaintiff
and the solicitors for the second and third defendants.
 There was no reason
why the settlement could not have taken place between them, and negotiations
with the fourth defendant continue
separately.  After the discussions the
solicitor for the plaintiff wrote out for the second and third defendants on a
piece of paper
the terms of an offer upon which those defendants were prepared
to settle with the plaintiff.  
<P>

5	It is clear that Mr Koltai, who is, in effect, in charge of the plaintiff,
was required to be a party to the proposed settlement.
 Those terms provided
for payment of a certain sum of money for what was described as a total release
of various wide-ranging claims,
including a claim raised in respect of a web
search engine and for transfer of certain IP and NIC numbers to Mr Blanchfield
and Mr
Koltai respectively. 
<P>

6	Mr Leather, the solicitor for the plaintiff, left the conference room at the
Court where the discussions were taking place to
obtain instructions from his
client, Mr Koltai.  He came back and said that the offer was accepted but that
some changes would need
to be made as to non interference with IP numbers and
informing users and past users of the settlement and a requirement that the
equipment which was to be returned to the plaintiff was in working order and
included passwords, all handles, transceivers, manuals
and media.  It is clear
enough that this was in terms of a counter offer.
<P>

7	Miss Platford, the solicitor for the second and third defendants, then
obtained instructions from her client and subsequently
informed Mr Leather that
those terms were agreed.   Mr Leather said that when he came back with the
counter offer he said that he
would need to see the exact wording of the
release proposed.  Miss Platford does not deny that.  She just doesn't remember
those
words being said.   There was a conversation under which it was agreed
that consent orders would be filed.  Those consent orders
were to include not
only a dismissal of the proceedings with no order as to costs, but in addition
provide for the transfer of the
IP numbers and the NIC handles.  The effect of
that would have been that those orders would have been made and otherwise the
proceedings
would have been dismissed with no order as to costs.  There is no
dissent about that.   
<P>

8	Miss Platford said that after these discussions and agreement had been
reached she said to Mr Leather, "Do you want to go and
tell the Judge that the
matter is settled?"  Mr Leather said, "Yes, I think we should do that now."
At that stage they shook hands
with each other.  As I was not sitting they did
not mention the matter in court.
<P>

9	Miss Platford asked Mr Leather whether he wanted her to ring my associate to
let her know the matter was settled, and she said
that Mr Leather said "Yes",
and she said she would do that when she got back to the office.  She said she
would draft the deed of
release setting out what had been agreed.  She
subsequently spoke to my associate to inform her the matter had been settled
and telephoned
Mr Leather to say that she had done so and that that my
associate had asked that she be informed when the matter was settled with
the
fourth defendant so that it could be listed for mention today.
<P>

10	Insofar as there is some dispute about this, in the affidavit of Mr Leather
which was sworn today and namely in paragraph 4,
after hearing his oral
evidence as to what happened, I accept the story of Miss Platford as to what
happened and what was to be done
by way of informing my associate of a
settlement and the listing of the matter. 
<P>

11	According to Miss Platford on the same date but later, namely about 5pm, she
either telephoned or received a call from Mr Leather
who said, "I have got a
problem, my client wants the web search engine."  She responded that it was
specifically agreed as being
part of the release that was in the written offer,
and it was quite clear and that there was an enforceable agreement in place.
Mr
Leather responded that that was his client's position.  He asked that he
should be told of the defendants' instructions on the web
search engine.
<P>

12	The following day Miss Platford telephoned Mr Leather and said that her
instructions were that there was an agreed settlement
and that the web search
engine was specifically released and the settlement was to be enforced.   There
is really no dispute about
any of this.  Mr Leather concedes that he had
informed Mr Koltai about what was to be released and had read to him what was
written
on the sheet of paper setting out the offer so far as the release was
concerned. 
<P>

13	So it is clear that the web search engine or claims in respect of it were to
be released.  Thus it is clear that if there were
an agreement, then this was
something new being raised outside the terms of the agreement.  On the other
hand, if there were no agreement
it would not matter.
<P>

14	As happens in these matters, and luckily they do not happen very often, the
only question that the Court needs to decide is whether
or not it was the
intention of the parties that no agreement be reached unless it were
incorporated in a writing signed by the parties.
 
<P>

15	For instance, in this case it is not suggested that although the document
with the terms refers to Mr Koltai and releases to
him and from him, those were
not properly part of the agreement reached or, on the other side, were not
properly part of what was
to be incorporated into a document which, on
execution, would become binding on the parties.  
<P>

16	Thus, the only question is whether or not there was an agreement reached
when Miss Platford told Mr Leather that her client agreed
to the additional
terms which he had said were required, it being envisaged that the agreement
would be set out later in a document
but would, nevertheless, be binding,
having been made, or whether there was no agreement until the writing came into
existence and
was duly executed. 	I have come to the conclusion that there was
a binding agreement.  In fact, this case is far clearer than most
of this type
of matter that comes before the Court.
<P>

17	There is no doubt that Mr Koltai, for the plaintiff, was aware of the
proposal.  There is no doubt that its terms were read to
him.  There is no
doubt that he knew that the claims in respect of the web search engine were
being released.  There is no doubt
that he subsequently changed his mind about
that but that is not to the point.   The point is that the agreement was clear.

<P>

18	I accept the evidence as to the arrangements to approach the Court to tell
me that the matter had been settled and the subsequent
arrangements to tell my
associate that was the position.  What has happened I am afraid is that the
plaintiff, through Mr Koltai,
changed its mind about one of the agreed terms.
It is not, in my view, a question of it being part of the arrangement and that
there
was nothing binding until the document was signed.  On the very clear and
proper evidence of Mr Leather, it is perfectly clear that
it was never
suggested that the agreement was subject to this.
<P>

19	The furthest his evidence would go would be a requirement to see the exact
wording of the release.  In my view, that does not
take it far enough.  There
was a binding agreement for settlement and that agreement ought to be enforced
and the appropriate order
made to that effect. 
<P>

20	The defendant should have the costs of the notice of motion. 
<P>

	(His Honour stated that he would prefer the parties to set out the precise
terms of the orders and that there would be settlement
in accordance with that
document when it was prepared.)
