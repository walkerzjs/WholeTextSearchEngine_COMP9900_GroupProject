<b>JUDGMENT  (Particulars of defence of comment &amp; qualified privilege -
mitigation of damages - contextual imputations - capacity

<P>

1	This action has been the subject of judgments and rulings as follows:  Dowd J
27 November 1995;  Levine J 30 November 1995;  Studdert
J 5 June 1996;  Levine
J 29 August 1997.
<P>

2	The Statement of Claim in these proceedings was filed on 29 November 1994 and
the plaintiffs sue on four publications.
<P>

3	The Defence was filed on 17 September 1997 and raises substantively defences
of comment, qualified privilege, justification under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15</a> and contextual
justification under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act, 1974</a>.</i>
<P>

4	With respect to the first publication (21 October 1994) the plaintiffs
contend that it conveys the following imputations:
<P>

	<i>"4(a)	the plaintiffs are extremely incompetent as Manager of the Estate
Mortgage Trusts;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the plaintiffs have acted dishonestly in their capacity as Managers of
the Estate Mortgage Trust".</i>
<P>

5	The defendants rely upon the following contextual imputations:
<P>

	<i>"13(a)...</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	The plaintiffs are extremely incompetent as Managers of the Estate
Mortgage Trust.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	The plaintiffs are dishonest.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	The plaintiffs' management of the Trusts have been disastrous for
unit holders.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	The plaintiffs' management of the units is dishonest because there is
no transparent or apparent accountability.</i>
<P>

<i>	(v)	The plaintiffs have improperly condemned and victimised the first
defendant.</i>
<P>

<i>	(vi)	The plaintiffs unjustifiably oppose the proposals made by or on behalf
of the first defendant as set out in annexure `A'.</i>
<P>

<i>	(vii)	The plaintiffs have acted unreasonably in opposing the first
defendant's proposals as set out in annexure `A'".</i>
<P>

6	The second matter complained of (1 October 1994) is said by the plaintiffs to
convey the following imputations:
<P>

	<i>"6(a)	the plaintiffs are extremely incompetent as Manager of the Estate
Mortgage Trusts;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the plaintiffs have acted dishonestly in their capacity as Managers of
the Estate Mortgage Trusts;</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	the plaintiffs as Managers of the Estate Mortgage Trusts have
deliberately breached their duties as such Managers by selling
a large number
of trusts properties to Mercantile Mutual at a gross undervalue;</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	the plaintiffs as the Managers of he Estate Mortgage Trusts have
deliberately deceived the unitholders of those trusts into increasing
their
fees to an exorbitant level;</i>
<P>

<i>	(e)	the plaintiffs as the Manager of the Estate Mortgage Trusts have
behaved improperly by reducing management fees and adding this
amount onto
property expenses".</i>
<P>

7	The defendants plead in respect of this publication the following contextual
imputations:
<P>

	<i>"14(a) ...</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	The plaintiffs are extremely incompetent as Managers of the Estate
Mortgage Trusts.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	The plaintiffs have acted dishonestly in their capacity as Managers of
the Estate Mortgage Trusts.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	The plaintiffs as managers of the Estate Mortgage Trusts have
deliberately deceived the unit holders into increasing their
fees to an
exorbitant level.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	The plaintiffs through and by their manager Grant Smith made an
unreasonable observation that the first defendant's letter of
20 June 1994 had
depressed the price of Meridian A and B Class units from 80 cents to 55
cents.</i>
<P>

<i>	(v)	the plaintiffs were so negligent in the managing of the Trusts that net
assets declined by nearly $1 million within a seven month
period.</i>
<P>

<i>	(vi)	The plaintiffs through and by their manager Grant Smith were
dishonest.</i>
<P>

<i>	(vii)	The plaintiffs were so incompetent that they forecast a net profit of
$61.6 million for the year ended June 1994 when in fact
the profit was only
$2.41 million.</i>
<P>

<i>	(viii)	The plaintiffs have so conducted their management of the Trusts that
an independent inquiry is warranted.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ix)	The plaintiffs are charging excessive fees.</i>
<P>

<i>	(x)	The plaintiffs are so incompetent in their management of the trusts
that assets have slumped instead of increasing in value.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xi)	The plaintiffs through and by the Manager Grant Smith were dishonest
because they deliberately mislead unit holders into believing
their management
fees were comparable to those charged previously by the Estate Mortgage
Managers but failed to disclose that the
Estate Mortgage Managers were managing
assets of over $1 billion whereas the Plaintiffs were managing assets of only a
fraction of
that sum.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xii)	The plaintiff through and by their Manager Grant Smith so conducted
themselves they made statements in the prospectus which
warranted a rebuke by
the NSW Health Minister.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xiii)	The plaintiffs through and by their Manager Grant Smith have engaged
in a desperate attempt to ridicule the first defendant.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xiv)	The plaintiffs were so incompetent in their management of the units
they sold nearly half their properties at the bottom of
the market at
distressed prices.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xiv)	The plaintiffs were in dereliction of their duties in respect of the
sale of properties.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xvi)	The plaintiffs through and by their Manager Grant Smith were so
negligent in and about the sale of properties that they sold
one property for
$5.15 million nearly $1 million below the last offer.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xvii)	The plaintiffs are dishonest.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xviii)	The plaintiffs unjustifiably oppose the proposals made by or on
behalf of the first defendant as set out in annexure `B'.</i>
<P>

<i>	(xix)	The plaintiffs have acted unreasonably in opposing the first
defendant's proposals as set out in annexure `B'".</i>
<P>

8	The third matter complained of (2 October 1994) is said, by the plaintiffs,
to convey the following imputations:
<P>

	<i>"8(a)	the plaintiffs have behaved improperly as the Managers of the Estate
Mortgage Trusts by charging exorbitant fees;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the plaintiffs have acted incompetently as Managers of the Estate
Mortgage Trusts".</i>
<P>

9	The contextual imputations upon which the defendants rely are:
<P>

	<i>"15(a) ...</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	The plaintiffs have behaved improperly as the managers of the Estate
Mortgage Trusts by charging exorbitant fees.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	The plaintiffs have acted incompetently as managers of the Estate
Mortgage Trusts.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	The plaintiffs through and by their Manager Grant Smith made
denigrating comments regarding the first defendant in order to
prevent any
reduction in the fees charged by the plaintiffs.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	The plaintiffs by themselves and their Manager Mr Grant Smith have
improperly sought to silence criticism.</i>
<P>

<i>	(v)	The plaintiffs are poor managers of the Trusts.</i>
<P>

<i>	(vi)	The plaintiffs themselves and through and by their Manager Mr Grant
Smith are hypocrites.</i>
<P>

<i>	(vii)	The plaintiffs through and by their Manager Grant Smith are dishonest
because they endeavoured to deceive unit holders in an
attempt to cover up a
trading loss.</i>
<P>

<i>	(viii)	The plaintiffs issued a misleading 1994 annual report because what
appears to be a profit of $2.14 million is actually a trading
loss of $2.782
million.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ix)	The plaintiffs are dishonest".</i>
<P>

10	The fourth publication upon which the plaintiffs sue (22 October 1994) is
said to convey the following imputations:
<P>

	<i>"10(a)	the plaintiffs have behaved improperly in their capacity as Managers
of the Estate Mortgage Trusts by deliberately fashioning
the trusts account in
order to deceive the unitholders;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the plaintiffs have behaved improperly in their capacity as Managers of
the Estate Mortgage Trusts by deliberately deceiving
a court in stating that
the trusts would be re-valued to twenty-five million dollars in the twelve
months between 1993 and 1994;
</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	the plaintiffs have behaved improperly in their capacity as Managers of
the Estate Mortgage Trusts by entering into a joint venture
which was otherwise
than in the interests of the unitholders".</i>
<P>

11	The defendants, in respect of this publication, allege the following
contextual imputations:
<P>

	<i>"16(a)	The plaintiffs have behaved improperly in their capacity as the
Managers of the Estate Mortgage Trusts by deliberately fashioning
the Trusts
accounts in order to deceive unit holders.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	The plaintiffs improperly failed to report an operating loss as on
June 1994 of $2.782 million.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	The plaintiffs through and by their Manager Grant Smith have
incompetently managed the Trusts.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	The plaintiffs are responsible for an accounting which was
deliberately fashioned to deceive unit holders.</i>
<P>

<i>	(v)	The plaintiffs are dishonest".</i>
<P>

12	By Notice of Motion filed on 4 December 1997 the plaintiffs seek orders that
the Defence be struck out or that further and better
particulars be provided.

<P>

13	The complaints made by the plaintiffs with respect to the particulars of the
defences of comment and qualified privilege are
the same as in action 16709 of
1991;  I do not propose to rehearse them;  I propose to make orders that the
defendants provide proper
particulars in response to requests numbers 3, 4 and
5 in the plaintiffs' solicitor's letter dated 21 October 1997. 
<P>

14	Further, the defendants will, of course, in relation to any pleas of
justification and contextual justification as remain after
consideration of the
latter, have to provide all proper particulars of facts, matters and
circumstances upon which reliance is placed
in asserting the substantial truth
of either the plaintiffs imputations or the defendants contextual
imputations.
<P>

15	As to contextual imputation 13(a)(i), it is struck out it being the same
imputation as pleaded by the plaintiffs. 
<P>

16	As to contextual imputation 13(a)(ii), I strike this imputation out as not
differing in substance from the plaintiffs' imputation
4(b). 
<P>

17	As to contextual imputation 13(a)(iii), I strike this out.  It appears to
attribute in no specific way anything about the plaintiffs'
management that
leads to what is asserted to be the consequence. 
<P>

18	As to contextual imputation 13(a)(iv), this should read "<i>the plaintiffs'
management of the units is dishonest because there is no transparent
accountability</i>".  I am prepared to allow this contextual imputation.  It
goes further than the general charge of dishonesty in plaintiffs' imputation
4(b) and the disallowed contextual imputation 13(a)(ii).  In any Amended
Defence, of course, the wording will have to be corrected.

<P>

19	Contextual imputation 13(a)(v) is struck out by reason of the use of the
word "<i>improperly</i>". 
<P>

20	Contextual imputations 13(a)(vi) and (vii) are struck out for the reasons
explained in the other judgment. 
<P>

21	As to the contextual imputation 14(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) it is noted that
these are withdrawn. 
<P>

22	In respect of contextual imputation 14(a)(iv), it is argued first that it is
not capable of being defamatory;  I disagree.  Next
it is argued that it is
incapable, even if being proved to be true, of adversely affecting any damages
to which the plaintiffs' are
entitled by reason of the failure to justify the
plaintiffs imputation.  This will be a matter for the trial.  Contextual
imputation
14(a)(iv) will go to the jury.  Contextual imputation 14(a)(v) and
it will go to the jury.  
<P>

23	Contextual imputation 14(a)(vi) is struck out by reason of the use of the
word "<i>dishonest</i>". 
<P>

24	Contextual imputation 14(a)(vii) I will allow to go to the jury. 
<P>

25	Contextual imputation 14(a)(viii) is struck out as not specifying precisely
what the "<i>conduct</i>" was. 
<P>

26	Contextual imputation 14(a)(ix) will go to the jury.  
<P>

27	As to contextual imputation 14(a)(x) I will allow this imputation to go the
jury.  It is an expansion of the assertion of incompetence
encapsulated in
plaintiffs' imputation 4(a). 
<P>

28	As to contextual imputation 14(a)(xi) I am not persuaded that the use of the
words "<i>through and by"</i> amount to a rolled up contextual imputation.
This contextual imputation will go to the jury.  
<P>

29	As to contextual imputation 14(a)(xii) the "<i>through and by"</i> argument
fails and I am not persuaded that it is incapable of being defamatory.  This
contextual imputation will go to the jury.

<P>

30	As to contextual imputation 14(a)(xiii) it is contended that this is not
capable of being conveyed (the arguments as to form
fail);  I am not persuaded
by this argument and contextual imputation 14(a)(xiii) will go to the jury. 
<P>

31	As to contextual imputation 14(a)(xiv), I will allow this contextual
imputation to go to the jury on the same basis as 14(a)(x).

<P>

32	As to contextual imputation 14(a)(xv), I strike this out as being
embarrassing in its vagueness. 
<P>

33	As to contextual imputation 14(a)(xvi), this contextual imputation will go
to the jury. 
<P>

34	As to contextual imputations 14(a)(xvii), (xviii) and (xix) these contextual
imputations are struck out for reasons which, I
trust, are by now clear. 
<P>

35	As to contextual imputation 15(a)(i) and (ii) these are withdrawn. 
<P>

36	As to contextual imputation 15(a)(iii) the "<i>through and by"</i> argument
is rejected.  The argument that the latter part of the imputation does not
sensibly connect with the first part is valid.
 I simply do not understand what
it means.  Contextual imputation 15(a)(iii) is struck out. 
<P>

37	Contextual imputation 15(a)(iv) is struck out:  "<i>improperly"</i> causing
the usual problems. 
<P>

38	As to contextual imputation 15(a)(v), this is struck out:  it does not
differ in substance from the pleaded imputations by the
plaintiffs. 
<P>

39	As to contextual imputation 15(a)(vi), I am not persuaded that it is
incapable of being conveyed;  the problem arises with the
use word
"<i>hypocrites"</i>.  The defect in form is that which brings it about that the
description "<i>hypocrit</i>e"<i> </i>is applicable is not pleaded as it can be
and should be in this contextual imputation.  It is therefore struck out. 
<P>

40	Contextual imputations 15(a)(vii) and (viii) will go to the jury. 
<P>

41	Contextual imputation 15(a)(ix) is struck out. 
<P>

42	Contextual imputation 16(a)(i) is struck out (it is the same as the
plaintiffs' imputation). 
<P>

43	Contextual imputation 16(a)(ii) is struck out by reason of the use of the
word "<i>improperly</i>". 
<P>

44	Contextual imputation 16(a)(iii) is struck out;  the "<i>through and by</i>"
argument is rejected but the lack of precision in the use of the word
"<i>incompetently</i>" is its principal vice in form. 
<P>

45	As to contextual imputation 16(a)(iv), this not does differ in substance
from plaintiffs' imputation 10(a) and is struck out.

<P>

46	Contextual imputation 16(a)(v) is struck out. 
<P>

47	Complaint is made about paragraph 8 of the Defence and I strike it out for
the same reasons that applied to paragraph 10 in matter
number 16709/91.
<P>

48	With respect to the matters raised in mitigation of damages for the reasons
referred to in the earlier judgments, I strike out
particulars (v), (vi) and
(vii). The considerations referred to in regard to the same or similar
particulars in the earlier judgments
are applicable here.
<P>

49	The plaintiffs have succeeded in their motion and costs will be awarded
accordingly:
<P>

50	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	The defendants are to provide proper further and better particulars of the
defence of comment and qualified privilege in response
to the plaintiffs'
solicitors letter of 21 October 1997, within 28 days.
<P>

2.	Contextual imputations 13(a)(i), (ii), (iii), (v), (vi) and (vii) are struck
out.
<P>

3.	Contextual imputation 13(a)(iv) as proposed to be amended will go to the
jury.
<P>

4.	Contextual imputations 14(a)(iv), (v), (vi), (ix), (x), (xi), (xii), (xiii),
(xiv) and (xvi) will go to the jury.
<P>

5.	Contextual imputations 14(a)(viii), (xv), (xvii), (xviii) and (xix) are
struck out.
<P>

6.	Contextual imputations 15(a)(iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (ix) are struck
out.
<P>

7.	Contextual imputations 15(a)(vii) and (viii) will go to the jury.
<P>

8.	Contextual imputations 16(a)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) are struck
out.
<P>

9.	Paragraph 8 of the Defence is struck out.
<P>

10.	Particulars (v), (vi) and (vii) of the particulars of Mitigation of Damages
are struck out.
<P>

11.	The defendants are to provide proper further and better particulars of
particulars (viii) of Mitigation of Damages, within 28
days.
<P>

12.	The defendants are to pay the plaintiffs' costs.
<P>

13.	Leave to file an Amended Defence within 28 days.
<P>

14.	At the expiry of 28 days, liberty to restore to the Defamation List on 3
days notice.
