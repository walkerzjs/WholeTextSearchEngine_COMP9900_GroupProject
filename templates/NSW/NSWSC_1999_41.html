DECISION: 
<P>

Appeal pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208</a> L is dismissed
<P>

JUDGMENT: 
<P>

1	This is an appeal from a cost assessment brought pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.208</a> L of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act 1987</a>.  The assessment was of a solicitor and client bill
of costs as between Mr Macdonald, the present plaintiff, and the firm
Benjafield
Milne, the present defendants.
<P>

2	It was Mr Macdonald's contention before the cost assessor that there was an
agreement with the solicitors that in the event of
the subject litigation being
unsuccessful Mr Macdonald would not be liable for solicitors costs, as distinct
from counsel's fees.
<P>

3	It appears to be common ground that the alleged agreement came into
existence, if it came into existence at all, subsequent to
a retainer which
would have entitled the solicitors to charge.  The agreement is said to have
arisen from dealings between Mr Connolly,
solicitor, on behalf of Mr Macdonald,
and Mr Benjafield, on behalf of the defendant firm. Mr Connolly's role, in
relation to the
subject litigation, need not be spelt out for the purposes of
this judgment.
<P>

4	It is common ground that there were dealings between him, on behalf of the
plaintiff, and Mr Benjafield on behalf of the firm.
 The question between the
parties was and is whether those dealings gave rise to an agreement, such as
that to which I have referred.
<P>

5	Concerning the grounds of appeal, I am of the opinion that grounds 1 to 3 do
not raise any question of law.
<P>

6	Leave was given to the plaintiff to supplement his grounds of appeal in a
manner which is now recorded.  That arose out of a dialogue
between myself and
counsel for the plaintiff. I must say that at that time I was not sufficiently
alert to the terms of Ground 4
in the grounds of appeal annexed to the summons.
It now seems to me that the additional ground of appeal may have been
unnecessary,
and that the point incorporated in the additional ground of appeal
may well have been before the court pursuant to Ground 4 annexed
to the summons
as filed. The apparent duplication is not of any moment in what I now have to
decide.
<P>

7	The material before the cost assessor, as disclosed by the evidence adduced
before me, included statutory declarations by Mr Connolly
and by Mr Benjafield
and letters dated 16 and 19 September.
<P>

8	It is submitted on behalf of Mr Macdonald, that it was not open to the cost
assessor, on the material before him, to  accept what
he took to be Mr
Benjafield's account of events in preference to what he took to be the account
proffered by Mr Connolly.
<P>

9	On behalf of the defendants it was submitted that there was evidence on which
the cost assessor could have reached his decision
and, accordingly, that his
determination cannot be disturbed in an appeal limited to questions of law.
<P>

10	It is further submitted that there was no consideration moving from the
defendants to support any such agreement as is alleged.
<P>

11	I will deal first with the last of the two points made on behalf of the
defendants.  I take the view that there was evidence
before the cost assessor
which, if accepted, was sufficient to support an agreement, such as is alleged.
The consideration was that
the defendants stood to gain the benefit of fees to
be earned in the event that Mr Macdonald was successful in the subject
litigation.
 By "to be earned" I mean to be earned after the asserted
conversation between the solicitors.  Had the defendants not made the
agreement,
on the plaintiff's case as to what transpired, it would have been
open to the plaintiff to go elsewhere for legal representation
subsequent to
the dialogue between the solicitors.
<P>

12	I return to the plaintiff's argument. The fact is that there was evidence
before the cost assessor which the cost assessor, was
entitled to take into
account as amounting to a denial by Mr Benjafield that the conversation between
the solicitors was as Mr Connolly
asserted.  Mr Benjafield's evidence is in
terms of his belief as to what he made clear and as to his intention in
relation to what
he meant to convey.  In a determination which is not subject
to the rules of evidence, that was material upon which the cost assessor
could
have found that what was asserted by Mr Connolly as having been said had not in
fact been said.
<P>

13	There is, however, a more fundamental problem in the plaintiff's argument.
It is this.  In the case of an appeal limited to questions
of law it is only in
the most exceptional circumstances that an appellate court will hold that the
tribunal below was bound to find
facts on which the party so contending bears
the onus, even where the evidence is all one way.  This case presents no
features which
make it relevantly exceptional in that respect.  The cost
assessor was not bound in law to find that there was an agreement, such
as has
been asserted.  
<P>

14	Accordingly the appeal pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.208</a> L is dismissed.
