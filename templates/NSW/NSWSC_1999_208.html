10461/98	<b>MARK FRANCIS WRIGHT   v   AUSTRALIAN ASSOCIATED MOTOR INSURERS
LTD</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR : This is an appeal from a decision of Master Harrison.  Mark
Francis Wright, to whom I shall refer as "the respondent"
(the plaintiff before
the master), claims to have suffered injury in a motor vehicle accident on 30
March 1991.  The <i>Motor Accidents Act </i>governed any claim arising from the
accident, and in particular s 52(4) of the statute applied.  In the form
relevant for these proceedings,
that sub-section provided:
<P>

	<i>"A claimant is not entitled to commence proceedings in respect of a claim
more than three years after the date on which the claim
must be made in
accordance with section 43 except with the leave of the court in which the
proceedings are to be taken."</i>
<P>

2	By summons filed 20 February 1998 the respondent sought leave of the court to
commence proceedings notwithstanding the lapse of
time since his accident, and
the application was successful.  Australian Associated Motor Insurers Ltd was
the appellant named in
the summons and it is convenient to refer to that
insurer as "the appellant" for present purposes.  It now appeals to this Court,
and in the notice of appeal the following grounds are stated:
<P>

	<i>"1.	The learned Master erred in failing to reject the Plaintiff's
application for leave to proceed brought pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 52(4)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor
Accidents Act 1988</a>, as amended (`the Act').</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	In granting the Plaintiff leave to proceed pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 52(4)</a> of
the Act, the learned Master failed to take into account the prejudice imposed
upon the Defendant.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	The learned Master erred in finding that the Plaintiff had made a full
and satisfactory explanation for his delay in commencing
proceedings."</i>
<P>

3	Subsequently the appellant gave notice of an additional ground of appeal,
namely that the master had erred in admitting certain
affidavit evidence, but
that ground was not pursued.
<P>

4	In the course of the hearing of the appeal ground 3 of the grounds stated in
the notice of appeal was not the subject of argument.
 I shall nevertheless
consider this ground shortly.
<P>

5	The master dealt with delay, at pp 18-19 of her judgment, directing herself
as to the need for a full and satisfactory explanation,
and as to the need to
consider the guidelines expressed by the Chief Justice in <i>Salido v The
Nominal Defendant</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2032%20NSWLR%20524" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 32 NSWLR 524</a> in a passage at 532-533.  The master
had set those guidelines out earlier in her judgment.  The master's judgment
recorded those
guidelines in their entirety and I shall not repeat them here,
but guideline 5 of course assumed particular relevance for the master's
consideration of delay.
<P>

6	What the master said as to delay was this:
<P>

	<i>"There was limited correspondence between the plaintiff's solicitors and
the defendant between 1991 and 1994.  When the plaintiff
was reliant upon his
brother, Norrie to pursue his claim.  The plaintiff's brother Norrie has given
a detailed explanation as to
what he did and did not do to pursue the
plaintiff's claim.  After the accident in 1991, the plaintiff found himself in
hospital
and rehabilitation for the next 5 years - until 1996.  The plaintiff
experienced depression from 1991 until 1992.  He could not talk
or physically
get around.  He communicates by means of a keyboard or by lip reading.  His
[presumably Norrie's] contact with the
plaintiff became less frequent over the
years.  After the defendant advised legal aid that it would not consent to the
application
seeking an extension of time, the defendant closed its file and did
not hear anything for 4 years until 1998.</i>
<P>

<i>	It was only when the plaintiff formed a relationship with Ms George, his
partner and current defacto wife, that she assisted the
plaintiff to pursue his
claim.  Their relationship started in December 1995 and she helped the
plaintiff with his claim from April
1996.  She wrote to his current solicitor
in 1996.  In April 1996, the plaintiff's solicitor was to undertake work and
advise the
plaintiff further.  When Ms George did not hear from the solicitor
she wrote letters to him on the 27 May 1996, 7 November 1996 and
25 November
1996.  As she had heard nothing by the end of 1996 she started to chase up the
solicitor by making weekly telephone calls.
 She finally terminated his
instructions on the 13 February 1997.  The plaintiff was entitled to rely on
his solicitor to carry out
his instructions and I consider that the plaintiff
is blameless for this delay.</i>
<P>

<i>	The plaintiff's partner instructed the plaintiff's current solicitor in
March 1997.  They in turn instructed private investigators
to obtain reports of
the accident from witnesses.  The investigators carried out investigations up
to the 5 November 1997 a period
of about 8 months.  These proceedings were
commenced on the 20 February 1998.  In these circumstances, it is my view that
the plaintiff
has provided a full and satisfactory explanation for his delay in
commencing proceedings."</i>
<P>

7	Mr Toomey of Queen's Counsel, who appeared for the appellant insurer, did not
directly challenge what the master said in the above
extract from her judgment,
and I do not consider that the finding that a full and satisfactory explanation
for delay had been provided
can be disturbed on this appeal.
<P>

8	I turn to consider the issues which occupied the time of this Court upon the
hearing of the appeal.
<P>

9	Mr Toomey focussed in his submissions upon two succinct points:
<P>

(i)	that the master was in error in determining that there was evidence to
establish a cause of action;
<P>

(ii)	that the master was in error in determining that:
<P>

(a)	the appellant did not suffer from significant prejudice; and
<P>

(b)	the delay did not have the consequence that a fair trial was unlikely.
<P>

10	The evidence before the master comprised the following:
<P>

(i)	the affidavit of the respondent sworn 1 February 1998;
<P>

(ii)	the affidavit of his present solicitor Mr Robert Dodaro sworn 12 February
1998.  Amongst the annexures to that affidavit were
investigators' reports and
a number of statements from witnesses who claimed some relevant knowledge
(often hearsay) of the events
of the night in question;
<P>

(iii)	the affidavit of the respondent's brother, Norrie Wright, sworn 2
February 1998;
<P>

(iv)	the affidavits of the respondent's current de facto wife, Stephanie
George, sworn 5 February 1998 and 25 June 1998.
<P>

11	The appellant relied upon two affidavits:
<P>

(v)	the affidavit of Rod Buckley, its CTP Claims Manager, sworn 22 June
1998;
<P>

(vi)	the affidavit of Linda Charleston, the solicitor with the conduct of the
matter on behalf of the appellant.  Her affidavit
was sworn 22 June 1998.
<P>

12	On the hearing of this appeal Mr Jacobs of Queen's Counsel, for the
respondent, made application to rely upon what he submitted
was fresh evidence,
being affidavits from Gary Midwood, sworn 22 December 1998, and of his wife,
Leone Midwood, sworn the same date.
 Mr Toomey opposed the introduction of this
evidence, submitting it was not fresh evidence at all.  He drew attention to
the fact
that Leone Midwood is the respondent's sister and submitted that what
she knew in 1991 was available to the respondent throughout,
and certainly
before the summons seeking the extension of time was filed.
<P>

13	Before considering whether the evidence of the last-named deponents should
be admitted, it is appropriate to consider the nature
of the respondent's case.
In this regard I refer to the master's findings:
<P>

	<i>"(1)	The plaintiff was born on the 3 April 1961 and is currently 36 years
of age.</i>
<P>

<i>	(2)	On the night of the 30 March 1991, the plaintiff alleges that he was
travelling along Bay Road Bolton Point in his vehicle, a
VW Beetle sedan and he
believes that he was a front seat passenger when the vehicle collided with an
electricity pole.</i>
<P>

<i>	(3)	The plaintiff has no recollection of the accident.  The last
recollections prior to the accident are that he had been drinking
and
socialising for a number of hours.  He recalls that at about 9.00 pm Donna, the
two Thompson brothers and himself were sitting
at a table in a pub.  He had
decided that he had drunk enough alcohol and told Donna that he was going to
lie down in the car and
that he was tired and he had had enough to drink.  He
also said in the presence of the Thompson brothers words to the effect that
if
someone could drive us home we would appreciate it.</i>
<P>

<i>	The Thompson brothers are both known by the moniker `Animal' or sometimes
`The Animal'.  Anthony James Thompson is the taller brother.</i>
<P>

<i>	(5)	As a result of the impact of the plaintiff's vehicle hitting the pole,
he suffered and continues to suffer significant brain
and spinal injuries which
have resulted in quadriplegia</i>
<P>

<i>	................</i>
<P>

<i>	(27)	The next facts relate to whether the plaintiff was the driver or
passenger.  Mr Lindsay Anderson a witness, gave a statement
on the 28 October
1991.  He is an independent witness.  He says that at 11.00 pm he was driving
in a westerly direction along Bay
Road, Bolton Point when he saw a white VW
coming in the opposite direction over the hill and as that vehicle went past he
began to
veer towards the centre of the roadway and then skidded back to the
left had side mounted the curb and spun around and colliding
with an electric
light pole as it went.  He saw something being thrown out of it.  He
immediately turned his car around and went
back and saw a man on the roadway.
There was no other person in the VW.  He said when the VW first passed him he
could not see how
many people were in it.  When he returned immediately after
the impact there were no other persons in the car or in the near vicinity
except the man on the roadway.  He remained on the scene until the police and
ambulance arrived.</i>
<P>

<i>	(28)	Anthony James Thompson (the taller brother nicknamed `Animal') says
that on Saturday the 30 March 1991, he was drinking at the
Toronto hotel from
about midday to 9.00 pm.  As he could not get a lift over to Bolton Point he
left and went to his mate Bill Kearn's
place.  He arrived there between 9.30 pm
and 9.45 pm.  While he was talking to Bill and `Bluey' he started coughing and
having pains
in his chest and went to hospital at about 10.30 pm to about 3.00
am when they let him go.  He says that he did not see the accident
in which
Mark Wright was involved and he has no idea as to what happened.  He says that
the last time he saw Mark Wright at the hotel
on the 30 March 1991, he was
legless and leaning over a cigarette machine.</i>
<P>

<i>	(29)	The John Hunter hospital records indicate that the Anthony Thompson
was very tender around his chest wall from his ribs 4 to
8 and was given
pethidine and panadene forte.  He was complaining of left side chest
pain.</i>
<P>

<i>	(30)	Brian Paul Thompson (the smaller brother nicknamed `Animal') says that
on 30 March 1991, he was at the Toronto RSL club from
about midday drinking
schooners until about 9.00 pm.  At about 9.30 pm he was walking past the
accident site and an ambulance officer
asked him to hold a drip which he put
into a bloke's arm.  He did not know who the injured bloke was but he has since
found out that
it was Mark Wright.  He did not see the accident happen.</i>
<P>

<i>	(31)	Troy Convery went past the accident site and saw the passenger door
open and he saw a person who he knows as `Animal' at the
accident scene.
`Animal' was standing near the front of the plaintiff's VW.</i>
<P>

<i>	(32)	Sally Anne Warren was drinking in the Toronto hotel and saw `Animal'
also drinking there.  She saw `Animal' at the accident
scene.</i>
<P>

<i>	(33)	The P4 traffic collision report records that the plaintiff was driving
the vehicle and no passengers were in the vehicle.  The
time of the accident is
recorded as 23.15.</i>
<P>

<i>	(34)	The damage to the motor vehicle is mainly on the drivers side front
guard.</i>
<P>

<i>	(35)	The plaintiff has had convictions in 1989 for driving with high range
PCA.  On the 21 October 1981 he was convicted of culpable
driving with alcohol
involved."</i>
<P>

14	The master expressed the following conclusion (at p 13), a conclusion
challenged on this appeal:
<P>

	<i>"There are facts to show that one of the Thompson brothers may have been
driving the vehicle at the time of the accident.  It is my
view that the
plaintiff has demonstrated that there is evidence to establish a cause of
action."</i>
<P>

15	Against that background I return to consider the evidence sought to be
introduced through the Midwoods, and in particular through
Mr Midwood.  His
evidence was that he had seen the respondent at the hotel on the night of the
accident.  He had observed the respondent
to be <i>"pretty drunk"</i> and had
later seen him in his car in the hotel carpark before Mr Midwood set off to
walk home.  According to Mr Midwood as he was
walking home he saw the
respondent's car pass him and he saw the respondent at that time in the front
passenger's seat.  He did not
see who the driver was.
<P>

16	The evidence of Mr Midwood was clearly relevant, but should it be received?
Section 75A(8) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></i>applies and accordingly<i>
</i>further evidence should not be received <i>"except on special
grounds"</i>.
<P>

17	The circumstances in which further evidence should be received under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 75(8)</a>
were considered by Hunt J in <i>Martin v Abbott Australasia Pty Limited</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%202%20NSWLR%20430" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 2 NSWLR 430.</a>  As his Honour pointed out in that case, at 436, <i>"no
precise formula has been or could be laid down as to what would amount to
`special grounds'", </i>but the term should not be narrowly construed, and
calls for a broader approach on an appeal from a master to a single judge than
in the context of an appeal from a single judge to the Court of Appeal.  In
this regard, I respectfully agree with what Hunt J said
in <i>Martin</i> (at
436-437):
<P>

	<i>"Another matter to be considered is the fact (to which Cross J, referred in
Do Carmo  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20NSWLR%20409" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 NSWLR 409</a>, at 420) that, according to the scheme of the Act
and of the rules, the appeals which are directed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/index.html#p60" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 60</a>, r 10 to a single
judge (as opposed to those which are directed by r 17 to the Court of Appeal)
relate in the main if not entirely
to matters of practice and procedure.  These
are matters which may be heard at first instance by either a master or a judge.
If heard
at first instance by a master, an appeal as of right lies to a single
judge:  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/index.html#p60" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 60</a>, r 10; if heard at first instance by a judge, an appeal to the
Court of Appeal lies only by leave of the Court of Appeal:  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a>,
s 101(2).  In my view, these circumstances support a more liberal
interpretation being given to the need for special grounds in
relation to
appeals in such matters from a master to a single judge."</i>
<P>

18	The following considerations assume relevance:
<P>

(i)	was this evidence that could have been obtained before by the exercise of
reasonable diligence?;
<P>

(ii)	the probative value of the evidence;
<P>

(iii)	the credibility of the witnesses.
<P>

19	Both witnesses were tested extensively in cross examination before me.  Mr
Midwood gave evidence he told his wife about what
he had seen shortly
afterwards.  Mrs Midwood gave similar evidence.  Each asserted for various
reasons that they did not discuss
with the respondent what Mr Midwood had seen.
Whilst this may at first seem surprising, having listened closely to the
evidence each
witness gave in cross examination and having observed each
witness as the relevant evidence was given, I accept that the evidence
Mr
Midwood had was not passed on to the respondent or to any person involved in
the pursuit of the respondent's cause until October
1998, that is to say at a
time months after the hearing before the master.
<P>

20	Mr Midwood's evidence is probative if believed, and whilst ultimately, if
this appeal is unsuccessful, the credibility of his
testimony will be for
another judge to determine, for present purposes the standard appropriate to
the admissibility of the evidence
has been met.  I consider that special
grounds have been shown and that I should receive the evidence of Mr Midwood
and of Mrs Midwood
as further evidence to be taken into account on this
appeal.
<P>

21	I have referred to the grounds of appeal as they are expressed by Mr Toomey.
I have already referred to the finding of the master
the subject of the first
ground argued.  The further finding of the master that prompted the expression
of the second ground argued
appears at p 18 of the master's judgment:
<P>

	<i>"The plaintiff discharged his onus and I am satisfied that the defendant
does not suffer from significant prejudice or that the delay
has meant that its
chance of a fair trial is unlikely."</i>
<P>

22	The decision reached by the master to grant the extension of time sought
involved an exercise of discretion.  This appeal from
that decision does not
permit of an unfettered review of the exercise of that discretion:  <i>Do Carmo
v Ford Excavations Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%201%20NSWLR%20409" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 1 NSWLR 409</a> at 420.  As that case
made clear, I should only examine the exercise of that discretion consistently
with the principles expressed
by Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in the much
cited passage from <i>House v The King</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1936] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281936%29%2055%20CLR%20499" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1936) 55 CLR 499</a> at 504-505:
<P>

	<i>"The manner in which an appeal against an exercise of discretion should be
determined is governed by established principles.  It is
not enough that the
judges composing the appellate court consider that, if they had been in the
position of the primary judge, they
would have taken a different course.  It
must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion.  If the
judge acts
upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant
matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does
not take
into account some material consideration, then his determination should be
reviewed and the appellate court may exercise
its own discretion in
substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so.  It may not appear
how the primary judge has reached
the result embodied in his order, but, if
upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may
infer that
in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the
discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance.  In
such a
case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of
the discretion is reviewed on the ground that
a substantial wrong has in fact
occurred."</i>
<P>

23	As I remarked earlier, Master Harrison recorded the guidelines expressed by
Gleeson CJ for a court considering an application
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52(4)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor
Accidents Act</a></i> in <i>Salido v The Nominal Defendant</i> (supra).  There was
a later decision of the High Court in <i>Brisbane South Regional Health
Authority v Taylor</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186 CLR 541</a> which was the focus of submissions in
the present case.  That decision concerned an application for an extension of
the limitation
period prescribed under the <i>Limitation of Actions Act</i>,
1974 (Qld), but there were statements of principle expressed in that case
considered apt to the discretion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52(4)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Accidents
Act</a></i> by the Court of Appeal in <i>Henricks v Agnew</i> (unreported, NSWCA,
23 October 1997).  
<P>

24	In <i>Brisbane South</i> the court was constituted by Dawson, Toohey,
Gummow, McHugh and Kirby JJ.
<P>

25	Dawson J, at 544, said that in discharging his onus the applicant <i>"must
establish that the commencement of an action beyond the limitation period would
not result in significant prejudice to the prospective
defendants."</i>
<P>

26	Toohey and Gummow JJ delivered a joint judgment in which their Honours said
at 548:
<P>

	<i>"Once an applicant satisfies pars (a) and (b) [referring to the statutory
requirements as to (a) the late acquisition of knowledge
of a material fact and
(b) evidence to establish the right of action] the court has a discretion to
extend the time for the bringing
of an action.  The material consideration (the
most important consideration in many cases) is whether, by reason of the time
that
has elapsed, a fair trial is possible.  Whether prejudice to the
prospective defendant is likely to thwart a fair trial is to be
answered by
reference to the situation at the time of the application."</i>
<P>

27	In his judgment McHugh J said at 552:
<P>

	<i>"The effect of delay on the quality of justice is no doubt one of the most
important influences motivating a legislature to enact
limitation periods for
commencing actions.  But it is not the only one.  Courts and commentators have
perceived four broad rationales
for the enactment of limitation periods.
First, as time goes by, relevant evidence is likely to be lost (Jones v
Bellgrove Properties
Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1949%5d%202%20KB%20700" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1949] 2 KB 700</a> at 704).  Second, it is oppressive,
even `cruel', to a defendant to allow an action to be brought long after the
circumstances which
gave rise to it have passed (RB Policies at Lloyd's v
Butler  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1950%5d%201%20KB%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1950] 1 KB 76</a> at 81-82).  Third, people should be able to arrange their
affairs and utilise their resources on the basis that claims can no longer
be
made against them (New South Wales Law Reform Commission, Limitation of Actions
for Personal Injury Claims (1986) LRC 50, p 3;
Law Reform Commission of Western
Australia, Limitation and Notice of Actions, Discussion Paper (1992) Project No
36, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Pt II</a>, p 11).  Insurers, public institutions and businesses, particularly
limited liability companies, have a significant interest in knowing
that they
have no liabilities beyond a definite period (In Limitation of Actions for
Latent Personal Injuries (1992) Report No 69,
p 10, the Law Reform Commissioner
of Tasmania said: `The need for certainty can be justified in many cases.  For
example, manufacturers
need to be able to "close their books" and calculate the
potential liability of their business enterprise with some degree of
uncertainty
before embarking on future development.  Under modern
circumstances, an award of damages compensation may be so large as to
jeopardise
the financial viability of a business.  The threat of open-ended
liability from unforeseen claims may be an unreasonable burden on
business.
Limitation periods may allow for more accurate and certain assessment of
potential liability.')"</i>
<P>

28	Later, at 555, his Honour said:
<P>

	<i>"But once the potential liability of the defendant had ended [referring to
the expiration of the limitation period], its capacity
to obtain a fair trial,
if an extension of time were granted, was relevant and important.  To subject a
defendant once again to a
potential liability that has expired may often be a
lesser evil than to deprive the plaintiff of the right to reinstate the lost
action.  This will often be the case where the plaintiff is without fault and
no actual prejudice to the defendant is readily apparent.
 But the justice of a
plaintiff's claim is seldom likely to be strong enough to warrant a court
reinstating a right of action against
a defendant who, by reason of delay in
commencing the action, is unable to fairly defend itself or is otherwise
prejudiced in fact
and who is not guilty of fraud, deception or concealment in
respect of the existence of the action."</i>
<P>

29	In <i>Council of the City of Sydney v Zegarac</i> (unreported, NSWCA, 3
September 1997) <i>Brisbane South</i> was considered in its application to s
60C and s 60E of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></i>.  Mason P said of the notions of
<i>"significant prejudice"</i>, referred to by Dawson J and McHugh J, and of
<i>"delay that makes the chances of a fair trial unlikely"</i>, referred to by
Toohey J and Gummow J, that they may differ.  The President said at p 8:
<P>

	<i>"I perceive that there may be a distinction between the notion of
`significant prejudice' and the notion of delay that makes `the
chances of a
fair trial unlikely'.  What further suggests that there is a distinction of
importance between the two sets of judgments
is the fact that Toohey and Gummow
JJ were in no doubt that the lapse of time had definitely caused `some
prejudice' to the appellant
in Brisbane South, if only because of the extent to
which the missing witness (Dr Chang) would have to rely on his notes in view
of
the lapse of time involved.  The concluding paragraphs of the joint judgment
also contain an express acknowledgment that different
conclusions were open on
the question of prejudice to the judge at first instance in Brisbane South, and
that it was not open for
an appellate court to substitute its own discretion
even were it of different view to that of the trial judge.  Now obviously these
remarks are to be read in the context of the case before the High Court.
Nevertheless they represent a clear indication that mere
proof of actual
prejudice will not dictate the rejection of an application to extend time.  I
do no more than note this possible
gulf between the obiter views of the
justices in Brisbane South:  it would be presumptuous for me to go further in
an attempt to
exegete the dicta in a very recent High Court decision."</i>
<P>

30	The various judgments in <i>Brisbane South</i> emphasise that an extension
of time should not be granted where a fair trial would not be possible.  In
determining whether a fair
trial is possible, prejudice that would be caused to
the defendant in the event of the discretion being exercised to extend time
is
a most material consideration.
<P>

31	The master recognised this to be the case and having cited each of the
decisions to which I have referred went on to say:
<P>

	<i>"In determining whether it is just and reasonable to grant leave, I will
examine whether the delay has made the chances of a fair
trial unlikely or
whether the defendant will suffer significant prejudice."</i>
<P>

32	I detect no error in the master's expression of approach.
<P>

33	This brings me back to the grounds relied upon by Mr Toomey.
<P>

34	As to the first of these grounds, that the master was in error in
determining that there was evidence to establish a cause of
action, I am not
persuaded that that challenge has been made good.
<P>

35	It seems to me that the respondent was not required to prove before the
master the likelihood of success in his cause in the
event that the extension
was granted.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 52</a> expresses no such requirement.  The section is to be
contrasted for instance with s 58 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></i> as it stood when
considered by Hunt J in <i>Martin</i> (supra) and with the limitation provision
considered in the High Court in <i>Brisbane South</i>.  The absence of an
express requirement in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a>, present in the statutes in <i>Martin</i> and
<i>Brisbane South</i> that the plaintiff prove the existence of evidence to
establish his cause of action, does not mean that the availability of evidence
to prove negligence is irrelevant in proceedings under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52(4).</a>  Plainly, such
availability is relevant.  It would not be appropriate to grant leave to pursue
a hopeless case.  The fifth of the
guidelines expression by Gleeson CJ in
<i>Salido</i> is in point here:  <i>"Leave under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/la133/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52(4)</a> may be refused if it
would be plainly futile to grant it..."</i>
<P>

36	Be that as it may, the finding that there was evidence to establish a cause
of action cannot in my opinion be disturbed.  The
respondent's case at present
certainly could not be described as strong, but I am unable to conclude that
the master fell into appealable
error in expressing the finding first
challenged.  I would add that the evidence of Mr Midwood now affords direct
evidence that the
respondent was not the driver of the car on the journey in
question so that his evidence strengthens the respondent's case to some
degree.
<P>

37	This brings me to the second ground of challenge.  Did the master err in
determining that the appellant did not suffer from significant
prejudice and
that the delay did not have the consequence that a fair trial was unlikely?
<P>

38	The master addressed those questions at p 18 of the judgment:
<P>

	<i>"I accept that the defendant would suffer from the tyranny of time as
witnesses' memories fade.  I have taken into account that some
of the witnesses
were affected by drugs and alcohol prior to the accident and their recollection
would be impaired.  However, the
defendant was on notice of the foreshadowed
proceedings in 1991, the year of the accident, when the insurer received the
claim form
and had the opportunity to interview witnesses.  It did interview
the Thompson brothers.</i>
<P>

<i>	In relation to the whereabouts of Anthony and Brian Thompson, the defendant
interviewed them in October 1991, after it received the
plaintiff's claim form.
The plaintiff's private investigator did not interview them in 1997 but there
is evidence to suggest that
their mother still lives in the same house in
Bolton Point.  The defendant has not put on any evidence to show that they do
not know
the whereabouts of the Thompson brothers.</i>
<P>

<i>	In relation to the insurer putting his affairs in order, as it was entitled
to do so, a claim manager from the defendant has given
evidence that although
there is no reserve on the file, the defendant is covered by reinsurance should
the claim be successful and
is able to pay any verdict moneys.</i>
<P>

<i>	The plaintiff discharged his onus and I am satisfied that the defendant
does not suffer from significant prejudice or that the delay
has meant that its
chance of a fair trial is unlikely."</i>
<P>

39	Mr Toomey submitted that the prejudice occasioned to the appellant by
allowing the respondent to pursue his claim is so great
that it is manifest
that the exercise of the master's discretion must have miscarried.  The
appellant has available the statement
of Mr Anderson referred to in the
master's findings of fact set out earlier, and it is not suggested that that
witness is not available.
 Indeed, Mr Toomey said that he is.  However, Mr
Toomey submitted, critical to the appellant is the evidence that Brian Thompson
and Anthony James Thompson could give to refute the inference that one or other
drove the respondent's vehicle.  Each of the Thompsons
was interviewed in the
same year as the accident and each gave a statement summarised in the master's
findings earlier set out. 
Mr Toomey submitted that the inability of the
appellant to trace these witnesses compels the conclusion, having regard to the
importance
of their evidence, that the discretion was wrongly exercised.
<P>

40	Reference was made to evidence before the master that the mother of the two
witnesses still lived at Bolton Point although it
was conceded before me that
she is now deceased.  In any event, whether the mother of the witnesses is
available or not the master
did not find that the two witnesses had themselves
been lost to the appellant. Had such a finding been made it seems to me that
that
should inevitably have led to the refusal of the extension application
because of the consequential prejudice to the appellant.
<P>

41	The master did refer to the fact that the respondent's investigator engaged
in 1997 did not interview either of the Thompsons.
That reference presumably
draws upon the report Annexure Q to Mr Dodaro's affidavit where the
investigator stated:
<P>

	<i>"Numerous attempts in contacting and locating the current whereabouts of Mr
Tony Thompson of 7 or 9 Quigley Road, Fennell Bay have
proved fruitless.
Inquiries with other potential witnesses have also failed to provide any
witnesses as to the current whereabouts
of Tony Thompson."</i>
<P>

42	What is the significance to be attributed to the master's observation that
the appellant had introduced no evidence that it was
unable to find the
Thompsons?
<P>

43	The issue of the onus of proof in an extension application was considered in
<i>Brisbane South</i>.  In their joint judgment Toohey and Gummow JJ said at
547:
<P>

	<i>"The discretion conferred by the sub-section is to order an extension of
the limitation period.  It is a discretion to grant, not
a discretion to
refuse, and on well established principles an applicant must satisfy the court
that grounds exist for exercising
the discretion in his or her favour (see Main
v Main <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1949/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1949] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281949%29%2078%20CLR%20636" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1949) 78 CLR 636</a> at 643, though the discretion there was not a
discretion to grant, but to refuse, a decree for dissolution of marriage).
There is
an evidentiary onus on the prospective defendant to raise any
consideration telling against the exercise of the discretion.  But
the ultimate
onus of satisfying the court that time should be extended remains on the
applicant.  Where prejudice is alleged by reason
of the effluxion of time, the
position is as stated by Gowans J in Cowie v State Electricity Commission (Vic)
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1964/103.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] VicRp 103</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20VR%20788" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] VR 788</a> at 793 in a passage which was endorsed by Gibbs J in Campbell v
United Pacific Transport Pty Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%20Qd%20R%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] Qd R 465</a> at 474:</i>
<P>

<i>	`It is for the respondent to place in evidence sufficient facts to lead the
Court to the view that prejudice would be occasioned
and it is then for the
applicant to show that these facts do not amount to material
prejudice.'"</i>
<P>

44	In his judgment in <i>Brisbane South</i> Kirby P said at 566-567:
<P>

	<i>"It is always open to a proposed defendant, resisting an application for
extension of time, to call evidence of any specific detriment
it would suffer
if an order were made.  The appellant did so in the present case.  If any such
evidence is called, a court must consider
it carefully in exercising its
residual discretion (cf Braedon v Hynes  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20NTJ%20885" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) NTJ 885</a> cited in Forbes v Davies
[1994] Aust Torts Reports 61,392 at 61,397-61,399).  If a defendant does not
call evidence, or calls evidence
which is unpersuasive or insignificant,
provided it is reasonable to infer that some evidence was available to it in
the circumstances
the defendant cannot complain if the court concludes that no
particular prejudice, over and beyond the generalities, could have been
established by it.  This is simply another way of saying that, because a
prospective defendant has an interest in keeping the limitation
bar in place
and in resisting an extension that lifts it, it may be inferred that he or she
would ordinarily place before a court
evidence of specific prejudice pertinent
to the exercise of the court's discretion.  If the prospective defendant does
not do so,
he or she cannot justly complain if the court infers, and then
holds, that the defendant has failed to demonstrate such prejudice.
 This is
not to shift the burden in the application from the applicant to the defendant.
It is simply to recognise that the burden
of persuading a court on the
particular issue of specific prejudice lies on the party making any such
suggestion.  This is what is
meant by the `evidentiary onus' resting on a
proposed defendant in relation to such an issue."</i>
<P>

45	Mason P referred to the above dicta in <i>Brisbane South</i> in his judgment
in <i>Zegarac</i> where his Honour said at p 4:
<P>

	<i>"Persuasive dicta in Brisbane South indicate that it is for the party
opposing the application to adduce evidence of facts suggesting
particular
prejudice if the discretion were exercise in the applicant's favour (see at 547
per Toohey J and Gummow J, citing Cowie
v State Electricity Commission (Vic)
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1964/103.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] VicRp 103</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20VR%20788" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] VR 788</a> at 793 and Campbell v United Pacific Transport Pty Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%20Qd%20R%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1966] Qd
R 465</a> at 474.  See also Kirby J at 566-7).  Failure to adduce such evidence may
draw the unfavourable inference that specific prejudice
is absent, due to the
fact that it is very much in that party's camp to know of the existence, impact
and `extent' of such prejudice."</i>
<P>

46	Whilst in the present case there was evidence before the master that the
respondent had been unable to find the Thompsons, it
did not follow that the
appellant would be unable to do so.  If indeed one or other of these witnesses
believed it was being asserted
that he had been the driver of the Volkswagon,
this could well have generated an unwillingness to come forward at the risk of
then
being sued.  It would not follow that these witnesses would be motivated
to hide from the appellant.
<P>

47	Whilst the legal onus did rest upon the respondent to persuade the master
that the discretion should be exercised in his favour,
there was the
evidentiary burden on the appellant as considered in <i>Brisbane South</i> to
prove the extent of its prejudice in the event of the application being
granted.  Such evidence as it did introduce did not touch
upon any difficulty
in finding either of the Thompsons.
<P>

48	On the second day of the hearing of this appeal Mr Toomey sought
unsuccessfully to introduce evidence on this issue.  However
no such evidence
was placed before the master and whether or not it could have been introduced
does not bear upon whether the master's
discretion miscarried in the absence of
such evidence.
<P>

49	This Court is confined by well settled principles and may not simply
substitute its discretion for that of the master.  The conclusion
I have
reached is that I am not convinced that the master's discretion miscarried in
this case.
<P>

50	Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and I order the appellant to pay the
respondent's costs.
<P>
