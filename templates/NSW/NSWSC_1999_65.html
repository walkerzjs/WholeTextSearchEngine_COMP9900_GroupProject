<center><b>JANE LOUISE SOMMER v. WILLAIM RONALD RONEY</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	This matter came before me this morning on referral from the Duty Judge, it
was in respect of a motion in the Duty Judge's list
seeking a declaration, in
essence, as to the breadth of the relationship of confidentiality arising
between doctor and patient and,
in particular, the circumstances within which
the confidentiality arising from the relationship might be waived.
<P>

2	The motion sought both a declaration and a stay.
<P>

3	The principal proceedings are proceedings for professional negligence.  These
have been stood over into the long matters list.
<P>

4	The debate in respect of the nature of the motion went so far as to allow the
exploration of alternatives to the grant of the
declaration and the stay sought
and ways in which the parties might accommodate each other in order to enable
some elucidation of
the matters of fact the defendant seeks to find out about
and protection for at least legal professional privilege for the plaintiff.
<P>

5	I have been informed the parties are undertaking discussions in that regard
and it has been sought that the matter go over to
the Duty Judge's list on
Monday.
<P>

6	I have made these remarks lest either of the parties should need to have them
taken out at any stage for resolution of any matter
that might be in dispute,
including costs in connection with this motion.
<P>

7	The matter can stand over to Monday 22 February 1999 in the Duty Judge's
list.
<P>
