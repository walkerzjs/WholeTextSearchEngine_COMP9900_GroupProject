<P>

<b><u>FRIDAY, 18 JUNE 1999</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>70032/98  -  REGINA  v  Dale Wesley BARRY</u></b>
<P>

<b>SENTENCE</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  Dale Wesley Barry is for sentence today
having been convicted by a jury on 11 June 1999 of the crimes of murder and
maliciously
wound with intent to do grievous bodily harm. The crime of murder
involved the killing of his wife, Sharon Lee-Anne Barry and the
crime of
maliciously wound with intent to do grievous bodily harm involved his
stepdaughter, Tara Dannielle Barry (also known as
Tara Graham), both offences
being committed on 9 December 1997 at what had been the family home in the
Albury area.
<P>

2   	The <b>Crimes Act</b> 1900 prescribes a maximum penalty of
penal servitude for life for the crime of murder and a maximum sentence of
twenty-five years
penal servitude for the crime of maliciously wound with
intent to do grievous bodily harm.
<P>

3   	The crime of maliciously wound with intent to do grievous
bodily harm was an alternative charge on the indictment to one of
wound with
intent to murder. The jury, having found the prisoner not guilty of the latter
offence, proceeded as I have said, to convict
him of the alternative count of
maliciously wound with intent to do grievous bodily harm.
<P>

4   	In determining an appropriate sentence I have to find the
facts relating to the offences consistently with the jury's verdict.
In so
doing I have adopted the criminal standard of proof, namely proof beyond
reasonable doubt.
<P>

5   	At the outset it should be noted that the prisoner did not
deny killing his wife. Indeed, he formally admitted at the trial
in so doing he
acted with either an intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. He raised a
defence of diminished responsibility
which the jury, by its verdict, plainly
rejected. 
<P>

6   	While provocation was not expressly raised as an issue in
the trial by counsel for the prisoner, material emerged during the
course of
the trial which, in my view, required me to charge the jury on provocation as
an issue for their determination. This I
did but again the jury's verdict
indicates that they were satisfied that the Crown had excluded provocation.
<P>

7   	The prisoner pleaded not guilty to the charges of wound
with intent to murder and maliciously wound with intent to do grievous
bodily
harm. Diminished responsibility, is, of course, no defence to either of these
charges and provocation is not a matter which
was relevant to them.
<P>

8   	I turn then to the facts of the matter.
<P>

9   	The prisoner and his wife were married on 19 September
1992. They had had a relatively short association prior to the marriage
but
that earlier association was attended by violence. The prisoner, in fact, being
found guilty of an assault upon her following
an incident which occurred on 1
July 1992. Indeed, extraordinarily enough, on the wedding night the prisoner
carried out a further
assault of some vehemence upon his wife which resulted in
him being brought again before the Local Court and again being convicted.
Not
surprisingly this led to a period of separation but after some months the
couple began cohabiting.
<P>

10   	At the time of the marriage of the prisoner and the
deceased, the deceased had two children from relationships with two men
other
than the prisoner. They were Tara, the victim of the second offence for which
the prisoner stands convicted before this Court
who was born on 2 January 1985
and a boy, Benjamin who was born on 11 April 1991. Following the prisoner and
the deceased commencing
cohabiting two daughters were born of their union,
Jaimyn who was born on 22 May 1993 and Ashlee who was born on 10 February
1995.
<P>

11   	The marriage continued, albeit with disagreements and on
the evidence of Tara Barry at least one episode of violence on the
prisoner's
part, and on other evidence other episodes of violence until November 1996 when
the prisoner struck the deceased on the
jaw. As a consequence of this assault
not only did a separation occur but an apprehended violence order was taken out
by the deceased
against the prisoner on 4 November 1996 for a period of twelve
months. That was later extended to 28 November 1997.
<P>

12   	During the period of separation which then followed it
appears that the prisoner had some access to his natural children and
stepchildren. Indeed, at Easter 1997 the prisoner had accompanied the deceased
and her children on a holiday to Bateman's Bay. Thereafter
it seems that
despite the continued existence of the apprehended violence order cohabitation
commenced again between the deceased
and the prisoner. That cohabitation
continued until October 1997 when, following an episode of violence which
involved the boy Benjamin,
the deceased had departed the house at 6 Conmurra
Way, Springdale Heights (a suburb of Albury) and took herself and her children
to the Albury Women's Refuge where they stayed for a week. As a consequence of
this episode a further apprehended violence order
was taken out against the
prisoner. The cohabitation thereafter ceased although the prisoner sought
access to the children. 
<P>

13   	On the evidence I am satisfied that on Saturday 6 December
1997 the deceased told the prisoner that he was no longer to have
access to the
children. 
<P>

14   	Following the separation which occurred in October 1997
the prisoner had been residing, inter alia, at premises at Thurgoona
(another
Albury suburb) with a former workmate, a Mr Arthur Milgate and Mr Milgate's
partner, Angela Harris.
<P>

15   	Prior to residing with Mr Milgate and Ms Harris and
following the separation the prisoner had himself admitted to the Nolan
House
unit of the Albury Base hospital principally for treatment for alcoholism but
where as an inmate of that institution, he was
diagnosed as suffering from an
adjustment disorder with a depressed mood. I shall return to this matter later
when dealing with matters
raised in mitigation.
<P>

16   	However, some two weeks after his discharge from Nolan
House the prisoner told Mr Milgate of his intention to kill his wife.
As I
understand Mr Milgate's evidence he believed that he had been able to dissuade
the prisoner from undertaking such a course.
<P>

17   	On the evening on 8 December 1997 the prisoner was
observed drinking at the Boomerang Hotel in the Albury suburb of Lavington.
At
about 12.30 am he was observed by the supervisor of the hotel to be standing by
his car which was parked at the rear of the hotel.
From there he made his way
to the family home at 6 Conmurra Way, Springdale Heights. The exact time of his
arrival at those premises
is not readily ascertainable from the evidence but it
seems that it was some time around 2 am.
<P>

18   	Again, it is not possible on the evidence to ascertain
exactly how it was that the prisoner obtained entry to the house but
the fact
was the he had keys upon him which would enable him to enter the house without
forced entry or it may be that the deceased
opened the door to him. I should
add that police investigations indicate that there were no signs of forced
entry. However, after
obtaining entry I accept that an argument developed
between the prisoner and the deceased probably about access to the children.
<P>

19   	Some time after he obtained entry the prisoner and the
deceased were observed by Tara Barry to be in the main bedroom of the
house on
the bed within that room - the prisoner being on top of the deceased. Following
the making of this observation Tara Barry
returned to her bedroom which was
described during the proceedings as bedroom two. There she stood in the doorway
of that bedroom
which was situated on a hallway which gave access to all four
bedrooms in the house. While standing at the doorway facing into the
hallway
she saw the prisoner walk down the hallway away from the main bedroom heading
in the direction of the kitchen of the house.
When the prisoner reached the
point at which Tara Barry was standing he turned, faced her and stabbed her in
the upper abdomen causing
a wound of approximately 2-3cm on her skin and
penetrating some 6-7cm into her body penetrating the right lobe of her liver
and dividing
the hepatic artery and portal vein. 
<P>

20   	Dr Merriman, a paediatric surgeon who subsequently treated
Tara Barry was of the view that administration of the wound she
observed would
have required a significant thrust.
<P>

21   	Soon thereafter the prisoner directed both Tara Barry and
the deceased into the kitchen. He forced his wife to the floor and
as I
understand the evidence, directed Tara Barry to also lie on the floor. He then
proceeded to stab the deceased at least four
times, three of the stab wounds
being inflicted to her right breast and one on her right upper arm. The
principal wound thus inflicted
was in the medial right breast which caused a
wound 17 mm long on her skin and extended some 160 cms into her body,
penetrating a
major vessel within her lungs. This would was categorised by Dr
Lawrence, forensic pathologist, as being the lethal injury. Lethal
because it
would cause death due to blood loss. There was also a knife wound to her left
hand between thumb and first finger which
was superficial in nature and
described by Dr Lawrence as a defence wound.
<P>

22   	The prisoner then left the kitchen. Tara Barry was still
on the floor, as was the deceased, both bleeding from the wounds
inflicted by
the prisoner. It seems the prisoner went to attend to the young children at
this stage. 
<P>

23   	He then returned to the kitchen and picked up a padded
stool and began to beat the deceased around the face with it. Dr Lawrence,
pathologist, found no less than five wounds which he felt were probably the
result of the application of blunt force to the deceased's
face, nose and cheek
area involving the breaking of the skin and fractures.
<P>

24   	Following the administration of these blows it seems that
the prisoner remained in the house for some little time. Tara Barry
somehow
made her way back to her bedroom and having lain on her bed for some time,
finding that the prisoner had departed the premises,
made her way across the
hallway between her bedroom and the bedroom occupied by her brother, Benjamin,
whom she successfully directed
to obtain help. He made his way to a neighbour's
house and as a result of which a Mrs Grelli entered the subject premises, saw
the
deceased and the attendant pools of blood and raised the alarm.
<P>

25   	Objectively the facts indicate a breach of the criminal
law of the highest order. The pathologist's evidence considered alone
indicates
the vehemence of the attack carried out on the deceased. The photographs taken
by police underscore the extent of that
vehemence.
<P>

26   	The stab wound inflicted upon Tara Barry was of itself
very serious. Not only was the damage done to her internal organs life
threatening but Dr Merriman, whose skilful treatment I have no doubt saved her
life, is of the view that the wound inflicted may
lead to significant morbidity
in the future. To describe the damage done to the body of Tara Barry as
grievous bodily harm is almost
to understate the nature of her injuries. I have
received a victim's impact statement relating to Tara Barry which indicates the
level of harm done to this young person, both of a physical and psychological
type.
<P>

27   	I turn then to the subjective matters relating to the
prisoner.
<P>

28   	The prisoner is now aged forty-one having been born on 30
May 1958. He has a criminal record involving a number of crimes
of violence. In
Victoria on 12 April 1988 he was sentenced to a total sentence of twenty-seven
months with a minimum term of eighteen
months for, inter alia, a crime known in
Victoria as intentionally cause serious injury.
<P>

29   	On 3 August 1990 he received a suspended sentence of six
months in Victoria for the crime of assault recklessly causing injury.

<P>

30   	In New South Wales he has at least two offences of assault
relating to the deceased and it seems a further offence of common
assault as a
result of an incident on 15 October 1996. He also has convictions for crimes of
dishonesty, namely theft and burglary
and three convictions for drug offences.
The convictions relating to assault are, of course, a relevant sentencing
consideration
in this case. See <b>Veen No 2,</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%2d88%29%20164%20CLR%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987-88), 164 CLR 465</a> at
477.
<P>

31   	I turn then to factors raised in mitigation. The first and
most important of these matters is the prisoner's mental condition
at the time
when the subject crimes were committed. Two psychiatrists who gave evidence at
the trial, Dr Jolly and Professor Mullen
were of the view that at the time when
the prisoner carried out both of these offences he was suffering from an
abnormality of mind.
Both were of the view that he was suffering from
depression at the time although Professor Mullen's opinion was that the
depression
was not as significant a phenomena as described by Dr Jolly.
Professor Mullen was also of the view that he was suffering from mood
and
personality disorders. Dr Jolly was of the view that the genesis of the
prisoner's abnormality of mind arose from inherent causes.

<P>

32   	There was thus evidence before the jury that two of the
three elements relating to the defence of diminished responsibility
were
present. However, both Dr Jolly and Professor Mullen agreed that if the account
given by Tara Barry was sequentially accurate
then it was not possible to infer
that he lost control at the time. I am of the view that his ability to exercise
willpower at the
time when he attacked the deceased is an element which caused
his defence to fail. I should add that I accept, without difficulty,
the
sequence of events deposed to by Tara Barry.
<P>

33   	However, while his defence failed, the fact is that there
is a unanimous view expressed by the psychiatrists that he was suffering
from
an abnormality of mind at the relevant time. This factor following what has
fallen from the Court of Criminal Appeal in <b>Regina v Twala,</b> unreported,
Court of Criminal Appeal, 4 November 1994 at 7, 8 and 11 and in <b>Regina v
Fernando,</b> unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 14 April 1999, particularly
at 148, is, in my view, sufficient to take the case out of the
category of
worst type of case which would give rise to the possible imposition of a life
sentence.
<P>

34   	In so saying I do not wish to be thought to be
underestimating the horrific and brutal nature of both crimes. While in the
case of murder it follows I am of the view I should impose a determinate
sentence, plainly enough it will have to be condign in nature.
<P>

35   	The prisoner had an unfortunate childhood. His natural
father was killed in a road traffic accident and he was subjected to
violence
by his stepfather who was a heavy drinker. Not only was he subjected to
violence but also he observed extreme violence by
his stepfather upon one of
his brothers. Professor Mullen described the home environment experienced by
the prisoner in his childhood
to be one of disorganisation, distress,
intimidation and violence.
<P>

36   	While the prisoner has occasionally used marijuana and at
one stage of his life abused heroin (that being some ten years ago)
he has been
a heavy drinker for many years to such an extent that Professor Mullen
described his main problem as being that of alcoholism.
<P>

37   	To his credit the prisoner has an excellent industrial
record working in clerical and unskilled and semi skilled occupations
on a
constant basis from the time he left school at the age of sixteen. Indeed, he
had been fully employed as a machine operator
at an engineering works in Albury
until a few days before the tragic events which led to his apprehension.
<P>

38   	He has today through his counsel expressed contrition and
indicates he has an insight into his mental condition at the time
of the
commission of the offences. Through his counsel it is submitted to me that he
is determined to improve himself and will continue
studies while in prison.
Also he has been receiving treatment within the prison system since his
incarceration and currently will
continue to receive that treatment.
<P>

39   	The court is thus presented with a forty one year old man
with a history of alcoholism, minor drug abuse and a childhood of
privation who
has been a good worker all his adult life. I have no doubt that he regards his
natural children with affection but
in view of the attack upon Tara Barry and
the past history of some further violence towards her which was given in
evidence and also
the violence exhibited towards his stepson Benjamin is such
that his affection is muted as far as those latter children are concerned.
<P>

40   	As I noted at the very outset of these remarks on sentence
both the crimes for which the prisoner stands convicted are very
serious
crimes. They stand high in the criminal calendar. Because both crimes were
committed as a consequence of the one episode,
I am of the view that I should
not impose a cumulative sentence but a concurrent one. In so doing I have taken
into account the totality
of his criminality involving both crimes.
<P>

41   	I accept Professor Mullen's view that at the time when
Professor Mullen saw him he was no longer suffering from depression.
As I have
already remarked, since he went into custody on the day of the commission of
the crime, 9 December 1997, he has been receiving
psychiatric treatment within
the prison system.
<P>

42   	In view of Professor Mullen's view that he is no longer
suffering from depression, it seems to me that this is a case where
special
circumstances pursuant to s 5(2) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></b> do not exist. I
should add that no special circumstances were pointed to by counsel for the
prisoner in his submissions on sentence
nor, may I say, were there any which I
believe he could have pointed to. Accordingly, the structure of the sentence
will be in accordance
with the proportion stipulated by the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing
Act</a></b> between the minimum and additional terms. The additional term which I
am about to impose which does not exceed one third of the minimum
term will
allow ample time for the prisoner to make a supervised re-entry into the
community, if released on parole at the expiration
of his minimum term.
<P>

43   	In <b>Twala's</b> case at p 15 Badgery-Parker J observed
that an examination of comparable sentences in what are described as
relationship cases was
a matter of assistance in determining the general range.
As in <b>Twala</b>, the objective circumstances here are such as to call for a
sentence at the higher end of the range. Unlike <b>Twala</b>, an additional
serious crime has to be taken into account as a consequence of his attack upon
Tara Graham. As I have said, I have
taken that matter into account in applying
the principles of totality of sentence.
<P>

44   	Having taken fully into account the mitigating factors in
the matter, including the prisoner's age, his expressed contrition,
his mental
condition at the time of the crime, his past history of violence and his
excellent industrial record but also I have had
to take into account the
objective seriousness of the crimes, I impose the following sentence.
<P>

45   	In relation to the crime of murder, a minimum term of
eighteen years commencing on 9 December 1997 and expiring on 8 December
2015
when the prisoner will be eligible for release on parole. An additional term of
six years commencing on 9 December 2015 and
expiring on 8 December 2021.
<P>

46   	As to the crime of maliciously wound with intent to commit
grievous bodily harm, I impose a fixed term of twelve years commencing
on 9
December 1997 and expiring on 8 December 2009
