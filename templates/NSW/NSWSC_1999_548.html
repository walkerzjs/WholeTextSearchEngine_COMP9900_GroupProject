<P>

<i>Monday, 7 June 1999</i>
<P>

<b>1351/99	MORROW MARKETING PTY LIMITED   -v-   HOME UNIT INVESTMENTS PTY
LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b> By summons filed on 12 February 1999 the
plaintiff, Morrow Marketing Pty Limited, seeks an order that the statutory
demand dated
8 January 1999 served upon it by the defendant, Home Unit
Investments Pty Limited, be set aside.  
<P>

2   	That statutory demand seeks payment by the plaintiff to the
defendant of the amount of $300,000 which is described in the schedule
to the
demand as follows:
<P>

Amount payable on 31 December 1998 pursuant to cl.1.1(a) of Deed dated 20
August 1996 between Morrow Marketing Pty Limited, Graham
Vincent Morrow, Carol
Anne Morrow, the creditor, Capers Pty Limited and James Rutherford Palmer -
$300,000.
<P>

3   	The plaintiff brings the present application pursuant to
the provisions of Division 3 of Part 5.4 of the Corporations Law.
  The grounds
upon which the plaintiff submits that the statutory demand should be set aside
are, firstly, that there is a genuine
dispute as to whether the debt is due and
payable; and, secondly that the affidavit in support of the demand does not
comply with
the statutory requirements, because it does not state the source of
the deponent's knowledge of the matters set forth in the affidavit.
<P>

4   	I have had the benefit of receiving from Counsel for each
party a written outline of the submissions on behalf of that party.
 I shall
retain those written outlines with the papers.
<P>

5   	The ground upon which the plaintiff submits that there is a
genuine dispute as to whether the debt is due and payable is that
the demand
grounded upon the provisions of the deed referred to in the schedule to the
demand is contrary to what is described on
behalf of the plaintiff as an oral
assurance given to the plaintiff shortly before the deed was executed.  That
oral assurance was,
so it was asserted, to the effect that if the plaintiff did
not have the money to pay on 31 December 1998, the defendant would wait
until
the plaintiff did have the money to pay.
<P>

6   	That oral assurance is alleged to have been given in the
course of a conversation in either mid-July or late-July 1996 between
Mr James
Rutherford Palmer (on behalf of the defendant, who is asserted to have given
such oral assurance), and Mr Graham Vincent
Morrow, on behalf of the plaintiff.
It will be appreciated that each of those gentlemen is, in his personal
capacity, a party to
the deed of 20 August 1996.
<P>

7   	The express provision of the deed upon which the defendant
relies in asserting that there is an amount of $300,000 presently
due and
payable by the plaintiff is clause 1.1(a) which provides as follows (the
abbreviations "GVM", and "MMPL" and "HUI" referring,
respectively, to Graham
Vincent Morrow and Morrow Marketing Pty Limited and Home Unit Investments Pty
Limited):
<P>

GVM and MMPL jointly and unconditionally undertake to pay to HUI without any
deduction or counter-claim -
<P>

 
<P>

(a)	the sum of $300,000 on 31 December 1998 provided, however, that if GVM, CAM
and MMPL observe and perform their obligations under
Part 5 of this deed, then
a discount will be allowed on that sum of $300,000 in the event of any early
and effective payment of part
of that sum.  The discount will equal the lower
of $3,000 or one per cent of the early payment made in each complete calendar
month
between the date of the early payment and 31 December 1998.
<P>

8   	(I would, for completeness, record that paragraph (b) of
that clause makes provision for the payment by GVM to MMPL of a further
sum of
$200,000 on 30 June 2000.)  
<P>

9   	The defendant also relies upon clause 1.2 of the deed which
provides:
<P>

Time is of the essence for the making of each of the payments referred to in
cl.1.1.
<P>

10   	The plaintiff submits that the effect of the alleged oral
assurance that if the plaintiff did not, on 31 December 1998, have
the money to
pay, then the defendant would wait for payment is such as to constitute a
genuine dispute between the plaintiff and
the defendant which, consonant with
the provisions of section 459H(1) of the <i>Corporations Law</i>, would require
that the statutory demand be set aside.
<P>

11   	I have been taken to various authorities relating to the
concept of a genuine dispute in the context of the provisions of
section 459H
of the <i>Corporations Law</i>.  The Full Court of the Federal Court of
Australia had occasion to consider this concept within the context of winding
up under the
<i>Corporations Law </i>in <i>Spencer Constructions Pty Limited  v
G &amp; M Aldridge Pty Limited </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1997/681.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] FCA 681</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2076%20FCR%20452" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 76 FCR 452.</a> At 462ff their Honours
helpfully summarised various earlier decisions dealing with whether or not
there existed a genuine dispute.
 At 464 their Honours concluded:
<P>

In our view a 'genuine' dispute requires that:
<P>

&#183;	the dispute be bona fide and truly exist in fact;
<P>

&#183;	the grounds for alleging the existence of a dispute are real and not
spurious, hypothetical, illusory or misconceived.
<P>

We consider that the various formulations referred to above can be helpful in
determining whether there is a genuine dispute in
a particular case, so long as
the formulation used does not become a substitute for the words of the
statute.
<P>

12   	It will be appreciated that in the instant case it is not
for the Court to arrive at any conclusions concerning the likely
ultimate
outcome if the Court is satisfied that there is, in fact, a genuine dispute as
to the existence of the debt which the defendant
relies on.
<P>

13   	The evidence discloses that there had been a business
association between Mr Morrow and Mr Palmer and their respective companies,
which are the parties to the present proceedings, since December 1993.  Mr
Palmer and his company had originally been involved in
assisting the plaintiff
company to emerge from receivership and then in the words that were used in
some of the items of evidence,
in assisting the plaintiff and Mr Morrow "to get
back on their feet".
<P>

14   	The amounts referred to in clause 1.1 of the deed, being
the amount of $300,000 (presently the subject of the statutory demand)
and a
further amount of $200,000 (referred to in paragraph (b) of that clause as
being payable on 30 June 2000) relate to past financial
advisory services given
by the defendant company and Mr Palmer to the plaintiff and Mr Morrow.
<P>

15   	It is submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that it was
only on account of the oral assurance to which I have referred asserted
by the
plaintiff to have been given in a conversation between Mr Morrow and Mr Palmer
in mid- or late-July 1996 that the deed was
eventually entered into by, amongst
others, the plaintiff and Mr Morrow on 20 August 1996.  The assertion that Mr
Palmer gave the
oral assurance that if the plaintiff did not have the money at
the time when it was liable to make the payment, Mr Palmer and the
defendant
would wait, is denied by Mr Palmer.
<P>

16   	The plaintiff submits that there are certain legal
consequences to the oral assurance on which it relies.  Firstly, that the
deed
should be set aside by reason of what is asserted to be the misleading and
deceptive conduct of the defendant in contravention
of section 52 of the
<i>Trade Practices Act</i>.  The plaintiff as to that alleged misleading and
deceptive conduct submits that at the time of the deed and subsequently the
defendant
intended to require payment on 31 December 1998 and to enforce its
rights to such payment.  The plaintiff says that in such circumstances
it was
false and misleading on the part of the defendant to assure the plaintiff that
if the plaintiff did not have the money the
defendant would wait.  
<P>

17   	In that regard the plaintiff relies on the decision of the
High Court of Australia in <i>Thomas v The ANZ Banking Group Limited </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1986/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] FCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2064%20ALR%20347" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986)
64 ALR 347</a>, especially the judgment of Toohey J at 372.
<P>

18   	Further, in that regard, the plaintiff submits that if the
true position of the defendant, that is, that the defendant would
rely upon the
express provisions of clause 1.1 of the deed had been revealed, the plaintiff
would not have entered into the deed.
<P>

19   	Further, the plaintiff submits that the defendant is
estopped from asserting that the debt was due and payable on 31 December
1998
and from seeking to enforce payment.  In that regard the plaintiff relies upon
the decision of the High Court of Australia in
<i>Waltons Stores Interstate
Limited  v  Maher </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20164%20CLR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 164 CLR 387.</a>
<P>

20   	The plaintiff further submits that the contract between
itself and the defendant was not limited to what was set forth in
the deed, but
included as a term of the contract between the parties the alleged oral
assurance which is asserted by the plaintiff.
  
<P>

21   	The plaintiff submits that the deed should be varied under
the provisions of section 87 of the <i>Trade Practices Act </i>by reason of
what is asserted to be the unconscionable conduct of the defendant in giving
the oral assurance to induce the plaintiff
into executing the deed and then
departing from that assurance.   Or, alternatively, that the deed should be
rectified for a common
mistake of both the plaintiff and the defendant; or on
account of a unilateral mistake of the plaintiff said to be known to the
defendant
at the time of execution.      
<P>

22   	A deed is the most solemn and binding manner known to the
law by which one party obliges itself contractually to another party.
 A deed
does not merely evidence an agreement.  It creates contractual rights between
the parties thereto.
<P>

23   	The plaintiff has made various assertions concerning the
existence of an oral assurance. That alleged oral assurance, if given,
was
given in mid- to late-July 1996.  After the conversation in which it is alleged
that Mr Palmer, on behalf of the defendant gave
that oral assurance,
negotiations then took place between the parties through their respective
solicitors concerning the preparation
and ultimate execution of a deed to give
effect to the contractual arrangements between the parties.   Those
negotiations involved
six separate drafts of the deed passing between the legal
representatives of the parties and at least two additional sets of emendations
passing between the respective solicitors.  
<P>

24   	The correspondence which passed between the solicitors for
the parties containing those six separate drafts and the various
additional
sets of emendations disclosed that those drafts were the subject of discussion
between Mr Morrow, on behalf of the plaintiff,
and his solicitor.  Each and
every one of those drafts contained clause 1.1 paragraph (a) and clause 1.2.
<P>

25   	Indeed, it should be observed that more than a year
earlier, in March of 1995, there was a proposal between Mr Morrow and
Mr Palmer
that there be a deed entered into between those gentlemen and their respective
companies.  The very provisions which now
appear in the deed of 20 August 1996
in clauses 1.1 and 1.2 were included in a proposed deed in March 1995.
<P>

26   	In considering the genuineness of the alleged dispute
between the parties, it seems to me not to be without significance,
that
although the deed was entered into on 20 August 1996 --- almost two and a half
years before the first payment contemplated by
clause 1.1 fell due --- the
plaintiff and Mr Morrow did not at any stage suggest that there was some other
term that varied, that
altered, that estopped, that entitled those persons to
have set aside, the obligations contained in that clause.  
<P>

27   	Indeed, even after it became clear to the plaintiff and Mr
Morrow in correspondence in November 1998 that the defendant and
Mr Palmer
proposed to rely upon the provisions of clause 1.1 (that intention being known
to the plaintiff by at least 9 November
1998), the plaintiff has not even to
the present time, in a period now in excess of seven months, sought to set
aside the deed for
the various grounds now sought to be relied upon and has not
sought rectification of the deed for the various grounds now sought
to be
relied upon.
<P>

28   	The deed is absolutely and completely clear in its terms.
What the plaintiff is seeking to do is to say that, because of a
conversation
(which is disputed on behalf of the defendant) which allegedly took place, a
conversation, not merely before the deed
was executed but before even the first
draft of the deed was prepared by the respective solicitors for the parties,
that the deed
which ultimately came to fruition after six separate drafts and
two additional sets of emendations passing between the parties and
their
solicitors, in none of which the plaintiff or Mr Morrow made the faintest
complaint about the requirements contained in clause
1.1, there is a genuine
dispute between the parties as to the liability of the plaintiff to pay in
accordance with the terms of clause
1.1 of the deed.
<P>

29   	Further, there was admitted into evidence Exhibit 24 which
was a letter dated 21 August 1996 from Mr Morrow to his solicitor
Miss Beverley
Hoskings-Green, of Messrs Atanaskovic Hartnell.  That letter was dated the very
day after the execution of the deed.
In it Mr Morrow on behalf of his wife
expressed to their solicitor their thanks for her:
<P>

genuine advice and understanding in helping to resolve the Palmer matter.  The
experience has been a very difficult one for us and
it is a relief to have it
settled.
<P>

30   	The terms of that letter are totally inconsistent with the
deed and clause 1.1 thereof being in any way qualified by some
alleged oral
assurance.
<P>

31   	I am not satisfied that there is a genuine dispute between
the parties concerning the liability of the plaintiff to pay what
it is
required to pay by the deed.  
<P>

32   	That conclusion of itself is sufficient to dispose of the
present proceedings. But even if the Court were to accept the evidence
that
there was somehow an oral assurance of the nature asserted by the plaintiff,
that of itself does not result in the conclusion
that there exists a genuine
dispute, or the requirement that the demand be set aside.  
<P>

33   	There has been a quantity of financial material placed
before the Court in relation to the financial circumstances of the
plaintiff
and of Mr and Mrs Morrow.  On the face of it, it would appear that the
plaintiff is able to pay the amount of $300,000.
But it emerges, and was stated
by Counsel for the plaintiff in answer to an enquiry from me, that the attitude
adopted by the plaintiff
has been that the plaintiff would pay the $300,000
after everyone else, including Mr and Mrs Morrow, had received what they
considered
they were entitled to receive from the assets of the plaintiff.  
<P>

34   	So even if (contrary to my first conclusion in relation to
the genuineness of what is asserted on behalf of the plaintiff
concerning the
alleged oral assurance given to the plaintiff) I were to be satisfied that
there was such an oral assertion which
qualified the express terms of the deed,
I am not satisfied that there is evidence which would activate the
circumstances contemplated
by such an oral assurance, which would defer the
payment of the amount.  So even for that reason I would not be satisfied that
there
is a genuine dispute as to the existence of the debt.
<P>

35   	The plaintiff also submits that the demand should be set
aside pursuant to the provisions of section 459J(b).  That sub-section
provides, relevantly:
<P>

On an application under section 459G, the Court may 
<P>

by order set aside the demand if it is satisfied that :
<P>

(b)	there is some other reason why the demand should be set aside.
<P>

36   	It is submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the
affidavit in support of the demand does not comply with the requirements
of the
statute.
<P>

37   	Section 459E provides in sub.s(3) that the demand, unless
the debt is a judgment debt, must be accompanied by an affidavit
that:
<P>

(a)	verifies that the debt, or the total of the amounts of the debts, is due
and payable by the company; and
<P>

(b) 	complies with the rules.
<P>

38   	The relevant rule, the compliance wherewith is required by
section 459E(3), is contained in Part 80A, rule 15 of the Supreme
Court Rules.
Subrule.(1) of that rule provides relevantly:
<P>

An affidavit referred to in section 459E(3) must:       
<P>

(c)	state the source of the deponent's knowledge of the matters stated in the
affidavit concerning the debt or debts.
<P>

39   	
<P>

40   	The affidavit accompanying the demand is that of James
Rutherford Palmer sworn 8 January 1999.   Paragraph 1 of his affidavit
says:
<P>

I am a director of the creditor and I have knowledge of the facts surrounding
the debt owing by the debtor so far as they are known
to the creditor.  I am
authorised to swear this affidavit on behalf of the creditor.
<P>

41   	It is submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that that
statement does not comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of Part
80A
rule 15(1), in that it does not state the source of the deponent's knowledge of
the matters stated in the affidavit.
<P>

42   	The deponent states in that paragraph that he is a
director of the creditor and he has knowledge of the facts.  The assurance
that
he is a director of the creditor may possibly constitute the source of his
knowledge.  
<P>

43   	I have been taken to the decision of Bryson J in
<i>Portrait Express Sales Pty Limited  v  Kodak Australia Pty Limited
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2020%20ACSR%20746" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 20 ACSR 746.</a>  His Honour in that case was dealing with an affidavit
allegedly verifying a statutory demand where the deponent of the affidavit
had
no personal knowledge whatsoever of the dispute between the parties and did not
set forth the basis of his alleged source of
knowledge.
<P>

44   	It seems to me in the circumstances of the present case,
where the deponent of the affidavit is the person who had all the
dealings with
the defendant and with Mr Morrow and where he asserts knowledge of the facts
surrounding the debt, that any omission
from the affidavit of a statement such
as, "the source of my knowledge is the fact that I am a party to the deed" or,
"the source
of my knowledge is the fact that I negotiated the deed with the
defendant", cannot in my view contravene the principle to which Bryson
J
referred in <i>Portrait Express</i> ---  that the dominant consideration in the
exercise of the discretion under paragraph (b) of section 459J(1) is the need
to ensure
the purity of the manner in which creditors follow statutory
procedures which are preliminary to litigation and for which verification
is
required by law.
<P>

45   	The affidavit itself, in paragraph (3), refers expressly
to the deed dated 20 August 1996 and to the parties to that deed,
those parties
including Mr Palmer himself.  It seems to me that at least it is a legitimate
inference to be drawn from paragraph
(3) of the affidavit that the source of
the knowledge asserted in paragraph (1) is the deed to which the deponent was a
party referred
to in paragraph (3).
<P>

46   	I am not satisfied that the affidavit does contravene the
requirement of the Rules. But if it does, this is certainly not
a case where
the Court should exercise its discretion to set aside the statutory demand as a
result of any failure on the part of
the deponent to state the source of his
knowledge.
<P>

47   	For the foregoing reasons, therefore, the summons will be
dismissed.
<P>

48   	(Mr Pike applied for costs)
<P>

49   	<b>MASTER</b>:  Do you wish to be heard on costs, Mr
Durack?
<P>

50   	DURACK:  No, Master.  I do wish it to be noted for the
record that it is not my recollection that in answer to a question
from you I
stated that the defendant would only be paid after payment of all other
liabilities, or other requests.
<P>

51   	<b>MASTER</b>:  That can be noted.  It is not my
recollection but it will be noted what you have just said.
<P>

52   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.   I order that the summons be dismissed.
<P>

2.   I order the plaintiff to pay the costs of the defendant.
<P>

53   	The two sets of submissions will be retained with the
papers.  The exhibits may be returned.
