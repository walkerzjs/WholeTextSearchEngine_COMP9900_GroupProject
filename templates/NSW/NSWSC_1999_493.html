<b>1011/99  -  DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION  v  COMDOX NO 69 PTY
LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  In this matter the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation
took proceedings for the winding up of the company. Those proceedings
were
dealt with by the Registrar on 4 May 1999 at which time there was no appearance
for the company. An order was made for the winding
up of the company and a
liquidator was appointed.  Subsequently the company purported to file a notice
of motion seeking an order
pursuant to Pt 40 r 9(3) of the Supreme Court Rules
that the order made by the Registrar on 4 May be vacated and that the winding
up summons be dismissed.  That motion came before me on 12 May 1999.
<P>

2  	I expressed some hesitation on a number of grounds.  I was
uncertain that it was appropriate for the company, by its directors,
to make
the application after an order had been made for the winding up of the company
and a liquidator had been appointed.
<P>

3  	I was also concerned that the company's state of solvency was
unclear.  In particular the balance sheet of the company as at
30 April 1989,
which was an annexure to an affidavit by the director of the company, indicated
a net deficit of $13,502 and a non-current
liability to the deponent director
of $68,514.
<P>

4  	The company's solicitor urged me to make the orders sought.  He
drew attention to the fact that both the liquidator and the
plaintiff in the
winding up proceedings had indicated that they neither supported nor opposed
the application.  He referred to the
decision in <i>George Ward Steel Pty
Limited v Kizkot Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2015%20ACLR%20464" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 15 ACLR 464</a> and submitted that the
evidence then before the Court literally satisfied the matters which in that
case Hodgson J said should be
satisfied before the orders would be made.  I,
nevertheless, declined to make the orders on 12 May 1999 and indicated I needed
to
be satisfied with respect to the concerns which I have described.
<P>

5  	Today the company, as applicant, returns to the Court and the
plaintiff in the winding up proceedings is also represented.
<P>

6  	The plaintiff's solicitor has confirmed to the Court that there
are no outstanding debts to the Deputy Commissioner and that
he neither
consents to nor opposes the application.
<P>

7  	As far as the matters which concerned me on the previous hearing
are concerned, I am now satisfied that these concerns have
been overcome and
that the orders should be made as sought. 
<P>

8  	First, as far as the applicant's standing is concerned, the
position under s 471A(1) of the Corporations Law is that, while
a company is
being wound up in insolvency, a person cannot perform or exercise and must not
perform or exercise a function or power
as an officer of the company unless one
of a number of conditions is satisfied.  There is some dispute as to whether s
471A has the
effect of removing from the directors of the company any residual
power which they may otherwise have had to make an application
such as the
present one:  cf<b> </b><i>Rockbottom Fashion Market Pty Limited  v   HR &amp;
CE Griffiths Pty Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/qld/QCA/1997/399.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] QCA 399</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2025%20ACSR%20467" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 25 ACSR 467</a>; <b> </b><i>Object Design Inc v
Object Design Australia Pty Limited</i> (1997) 24 ACSR 678.  However, it is not
necessary for me to resolve that issue in the present case because the
applicant has tendered
evidence that the liquidator has given written approval
to the director of the company making the present application and has
authorised
the application.  One of the exceptions to the operation of s
471A(1) is found in sub-para (c), which applies where a person performs
a
function as an officer of the company with the liquidator's approval.
<P>

9  	The application in the present case is an application under Pt 40
r 9 to set aside the winding up order made on 4 May 1999.
 It is not an
application brought under s 482 by, for example, a contributory.  However, the
use of Pt 40 r 9(3) in such a case is
well established:  see<b> </b><i>Re Rick
Wilson Pty Limited</i><b> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%207%20ACLR%20354" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 7 ACLR 354</a> .
<P>

10  	As regards the director's loan account, evidence has been
tendered in the form of an affidavit by the external accountant for
the
company, that a deed poll has been executed by Paul Anthony Ginty, director,
with respect to the debt which the company owes
him in the amount of $68,514.
In that deed poll Mr Ginty agrees that payment of the whole or any part of the
debt owed by the company
to him was postponed until such time as all other
debts the company owes, whether secured or unsecured, have been satisfied in
full.
 The relevance of this deed poll is that it goes to the basic question of
solvency of the company.  It would be inappropriate, in
my opinion, to make the
orders sought in the application if I had any significant concern that the
company would, if resuscitated,
then be insolvent.  Section 95A of the
Corporations Law defines solvency and insolvency.  The definition refers to the
question whether
the person concerned is able to pay all of that person's debts
as and when they become due and payable.  The effect of the deed poll
is that
debt to Mr Ginty would not become payable until all other debts have been
satisfied.  It seems to me that in those circumstances
it is appropriate to
conclude that for the purposes of the winding up provisions of the Corporation
Law the company should be regarded
as solvent.
<P>

11  	The solicitor for the company indicated he had Mr Ginty's
instructions that if the Court was not otherwise satisfied as to
solvency Mr
Ginty would undertake to the Court to convert the loan account debt into
equity.  It seems to me that is not necessary
in the circumstances.
<P>

12  	My final concern in the matter was to ensure that there was some
independent verification of the company's financial  position,
independent of
the director or directors of the company.  That is provided in this case by a
further affidavit deposed to by the
company's accountant.
<P>

13  	The company is not a company which trades.  There are no
sub-contractors or employees other than Mr Ginty.  In those circumstances
it
appears to me appropriate that the orders be made.
<P>

14  	I grant leave to the applicant to file in Court an affidavit of
Christopher Thomas Duffy sworn 13 May 1999.
<P>

15  	I maker orders one to three in the notice of motion filed on 12
May 1999.
<P>

16  	The orders are to be taken out forthwith in the registry.
<P>
