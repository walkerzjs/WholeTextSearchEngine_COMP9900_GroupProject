<b>TUESDAY 20 JULY 1999</b>

<b>1648/99 - RONALD ARCHIE MOTUM V GRAHAM ARTHUR MOTUM &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR :   </b>Herbert Arthur Motum, retired
fisherman of Tea Gardens, Port Stephens, died on 19 August 1950 having first
duly made and published
his last will on 16 December 1947, probate of which was
granted by this Court on 12 September 1952.
<P>

2   	The will is a handwritten will and it is necessary to set
out the dispositive provisions in full:
<P>

"I give and bequeath to my Dear Wife Mary Sophia Motum all my Private and
Personal estate consisting of all monies in hand or in
Banks and my house and
ground Known as Myall Villa lot 32 of A. A Company Estate Fronting River
Reservation Street Tea Gardens and
Lot 7 Being portion of Jacob Houghs
Subdivision where are erected 2 small Cottages for Rental Purposes.  The shed
erected their on
with all nets and gear there in is the sole Property of my two
Sons Gordon Leslie Motum and Ronald Archie Motum
<P>

At my Wifes Death this Property is to be left to my Daughter Kate. Elisa. Motum
and my Son Arthur. Maxwell. Motum equally between
them for Life if my Daughter
should Marry then the (sic) Her Share to revert to Arthur Maxwell Motum  My
Oyster Leases No 44.11.
No 45, 50 and Leases on Witts Island to my Son Eric
Arthur Motum  And my Launch and Boats to Arthur Maxwell Motum to rent with the
Cottages."
<P>

3   	The testator had eleven children.  All except the plaintiff
Ronald are now deceased.  Kate was the second child.  She was born
on 8
September 1903 and died on 26 September 1998.   Arthur was the youngest.  He
was born on 21 December 1922 and died on 19 July
1996.  The widow died on 4
July 1965.
<P>

4   	The only remaining property in the estate is real estate at
8 Jacob Street, Tea Gardens, the current value of which is $150,000.
 However,
the answer to the problem posed in this case may also have some effect on past
transactions.
<P>

5   	The essential question is whether on the true construction
of the testator's will, and the events which have happened, the
property at 8
Jacob Street, Tea Gardens is held by the legal representatives of Kate and
Arthur absolutely, or whether the property
passes as on a partial intestacy to
the testator's next of kin.
<P>

6   	Mr Willmott appeared for the plaintiff and also put
arguments in favour of an absolute interest.  The first and second defendants
appeared in person but took no part in the argument.  They represent the estate
of Arthur, the plaintiff being the representative
of Kate.  The third defendant
represents the next of kin.
<P>

7   	Mr Sharpe, who appeared for the third defendant, has
reminded me of the stricture in the authorities that courts need to look
at the
words which the testator has used and construe those words, rather than embark
on any speculative exercise as to what the
testator might have wanted to say
had he thought about it.  He says this is so even if the result may be bizarre:
<b>Fell v Fell </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1922/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1922] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281922%29%2031%20CLR%20268" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1922) 31 CLR 268</a>, 274;  <b>Re James's Will Trusts
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1962%5d%20Ch%20226" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1962] Ch 226.</a>  Mr Sharpe then says one sees in this will the words "for
life" and when one sees those words it is evident that the testator meant
to
grant only a life estate.  It is just that simple.
<P>

8   	Unfortunately, it is not that simple for a number of
reasons.  First, giving Kate and Arthur an estate "equally between them
for
life" could mean a variety of different things.  Kate was 19 years older than
Arthur.  The testator might have thought that she
would die before Arthur, but
the way in which the will is expressed no provision has been made for what
would happen if one of the
children did die before the other.
<P>

9   	Mr Sharpe says that the proper construction is that Kate
was a tenant in common of a moiety for life and Arthur was tenant
in common
with her of the other moiety.  Accordingly, upon Arthur's death there was an
intestacy as to the income of his moiety,
while Kate only continued to enjoy
the income from the other moiety.  That is possible as the word "equally" tends
to denote a tenancy
in common:  <b>Rentoul v Rentoul </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1944/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1944] VicLawRp 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1944%5d%20VLR%20205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1944] VLR 205</a>, 206.
However, another construction is that Kate and Arthur enjoyed the income
equally for their joint lives and then when one of
them died the survivor took
the whole of the income of the estate until he or she died.  This would avoid
assuming that the testator
intended an intestacy as to the income from a
moiety.
<P>

10   	But there is another complication and that is caused by
the word "revert".  That word usually means turns back again or vests
back
again:  cf <b>Re Norman's Trusts </b>[1879] WN (Eng) 175.  How could Kate's
share ever go back again to Arthur?  On the view that the words "for life" mean
what Mr Sharpe
says they mean there is no answer to that question. The only
possible view is that the testator tried to be clever by using words
he did not
understand.  That is a possibility, but it is speculation.
<P>

11   	There are then other odd things about the will.  The
property included eventually the house in which the widow was living
and two
cottages which were for rental purposes.  The final words of the will say that
Arthur is to have the launch and boats outright
to rent with the cottages, but
how can he rent the boats and cottages if he does not own them?
<P>

12   	Everyone seems to have assumed that the widow took a life
estate in the house and the cottages and all the land, and I will
just assume
that that was so.  However, the words at the end of the will seem to indicate
that Arthur was to have an overriding interest
in the cottages, at least, and
that he was to be the one controlling them.
<P>

13   	It may well be that as Arthur was the youngest male, and
the daughter Kate at the date of the will being forty-four and unmarried,
the
testator thought that that was the natural thing to do and that Kate would
predecease Arthur.  Thus he considered that the cottages
would be Arthur's at
least for life.  That sort of flavour does seem to come into the will.
<P>

14   	The testator seems to have understood what a life interest
was and that he needed to make provision after the death of his
widow.  He has
not made any provision as to what was to happen after the death of Arthur and
Kate.  It may be that like many people
who are making a will they think of the
immediate disposition of their property and forget to put in a residuary
clause.  However,
there is a presumption, albeit a slight presumption, against
intestacy on the basis that people who go to the trouble to make a will
are not
intending to take part in a solemn farce.
<P>

15   	The will can be read sensibly if one takes the words
commencing "for life" as if they were in parentheses, that is that Kate
and
Arthur are to take the property in remainder after the widow's death equally
between them absolutely, but that should the daughter
marry she should only
enjoy her interest for life and then her share would revert to Arthur. This
might be able to be explained because
the testator had eleven children, he only
made provision for two and he seemed to make provision for his unmarried
daughter because
it was necessary for her to have somewhere to live, but he did
not intend that the property should go outside the family to her husband
after
her death.
<P>

16   	Whichever way one looks at the will, one gets problems. I
have to do the best I can with the words the testator used and it
seems to me
that the true construction of the will is that Kate and Arthur and accordingly
their estates take the property absolutely.
<P>

17   	Accordingly, I answer question 1(b) in the summons "Yes".
I appoint the third defendant to represent the interests of the
next of kin and
I order that the costs of all parties be paid on the indemnity basis out of the
estate.  The exhibits may be returned
and the original will may go back to the
Probate Office.
<P>

 
<P>
