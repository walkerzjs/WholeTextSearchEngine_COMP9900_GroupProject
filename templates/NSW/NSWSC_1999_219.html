<i>Tuesday, 23 March 1999</i>
<P>

<b>3745 of 1997	JOHN VALENTINE MACLEAY  -v-</b>
<P>

<b>			SYDNEY FRANK BIRCHALL</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act
</i>1982</a>.
<P>

2	By summons filed on 25 August 1997, the plaintiff John Valentine Macleay
seeks an order that further provision be made for him
for his maintenance and
advancement in life out of the estate of the late Doris Myra Macleay (to whom I
shall refer as "the deceased").
(Subsequently, on 18 September 1997, an amended
summons, seeking identical relief, was filed on behalf of the plaintiff. The
reason
for the filing of the amended summons was in order to correct the wrong
spelling of the surname of the defendant appearing in the
summons.)
<P>

3	The deceased died on 23 August 1996, aged ninety. She left a will dated 22
April 1996 and a codicil thereto dated 30 April 1996,
probate whereof was on 17
March 1997 granted to Sydney Frank Birchall, the executor named in such will
(who is the defendant to the
present proceedings). 
<P>

4	The assets of the estate included the former residence of the deceased at 21
King William Street, Greenwich (which was sold in
December 1997 for $550,000)
and a taxi licence valued by the Department of Transport at $261,982. After
payment of liabilities totalling
about $12,400, and making allowance for the
costs of the present proceedings (those of the plaintiff estimated to be about
$31,000
and of the defendant estimated to be about $29,000), together with
further costs relating to the application for probate, administration
expenses,
costs on the sale of estate realty (totalling $44,300), the defendant estimates
that the distributable estate is likely
to amount to about $991,470.
<P>

5	By her will the deceased gave a number of legacies, totalling $16,000. (Those
legacies included a legacy to the plaintiff of $5,000.)
The deceased gave her
taxi licence to the four sons of the plaintiff as joint tenants. The residue of
the estate was given to two
nieces and the defendant, as tenants in common in
equal shares. (The defendant is a nephew of the deceased, his mother having
been
the deceased's sister.)
<P>

6	The plaintiff is the son of the late husband of the deceased; that is, he is
the stepson of the deceased. The plaintiff asserts
that he has the standing to
bring the present proceedings, in that he is an eligible person within
paragraph (d) of the definition
of that phrase contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6</a> (1) of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>.</i> Relevantly, that definition is 
<P>

	A person ---
<P>

	(i) 	who was, at any particular time, wholly or partly 	dependent upon the
deceased person; and
<P>

	(ii) 	who is a grandchild of the deceased person or was, at 	that particular
time or at any other time, a member 	of a household
of which the deceased
person was a 	member.
<P>

7	The plaintiff was born on 6 February 1929, and is presently aged seventy. His
mother, according the plaintiff's oral evidence,
died in about 1940.
Subsequently, on 8 May 1943 the plaintiff's father, Alfred John Macleay,
married the deceased. The plaintiff
was aged fourteen at that time. According
to the plaintiff (but, as will become apparent, the plaintiff's recollection of
dates,
events, and sequences of events was far from reliable, and at times the
evidence in his affidavits was not entirely consistent, and
his oral evidence
was different again), he was a boarder at Knox Grammar School at Wahroonga at
the time of his father's marriage
to the deceased. 
<P>

8	However, a letter from the headmaster of Knox Grammar School dated 16 October
1997 (annexure J to the affidavit of Sydney Frank
Birchall sworn 23 June 1998)
states that according to the records of that school the plaintiff left Knox in
December 1942.
<P>

9	In his affidavit of 18 August 1997 the plaintiff says, in paragraph 5, that
after the marriage of his father and the deceased
he continued as a boarder at
Knox, and that he visited them at Wollstonecraft (whither his father had gone
to live with the deceased
at her residence at 4 Flemming Street,
Wollstonecraft) on average once a month. In the same paragraph he says that he
never stayed
overnight at Wollstonecraft.
<P>

10	According to the plaintiff's principal affidavit, of 18 August 1997, his
father and the deceased moved to Cooranbong in 1944
and the plaintiff went with
them. He says that he attended Cooranbong High School and lived with his father
and the deceased at their
home at 20 Avondale Road, Cooranbong. In paragraph 6
of that affidavit the plaintiff says that in 1946 his father and the deceased
went overseas on the <i>Oriana</i> for an extended holiday of nearly nine
months and that, by that time the plaintiff having left school (having obtained
his Intermediate
Certificate at the end of 1945), he continued to live in the
Avondale Road house until this overseas trip, when he went to live with
his
grandmother. Upon the return of his father and the deceased the plaintiff
requested that he remain at his grandmother's, as there
was more room there and
a place for him to garage his motor car. They agreed to that request. 
<P>

11	But in his oral evidence, under cross-examination, the plaintiff said that
after leaving Knox (an event which he said took place
at the end of 1942), he
went to live with his grandparents at their residence at Cooranbong in 1943
(that is, in the year preceding
the move of his father and the deceased to that
location in 1944), and that he continued to reside with them until the arrival
of
his father and the deceased. Even during the lifetime of his mother the
plaintiff had, on occasion, stayed with his grandparents
at Cooranbong.
<P>

12	It is the foregoing period, from the arrival of the deceased, his father and
the plaintiff at Cooranbong until his removal to
his grandmother's residence
that the plaintiff relies upon as fulfilling the second limb of the definition
contained in paragraph
(d). It was the case for the plaintiff that that period
extended over some thirteen months, from the latter part of 1944 until early
1946.
<P>

13	Considerable and detailed evidence was placed before the Court on behalf of
the defendant executor, which clearly establishes,
firstly, that the
plaintiff's father went on no overseas trip (be it on the <i>Oriana</i> or on
any other vessel) in 1946, or, indeed, at any time before 1950, and that the
deceased did not go on any overseas trip until
1956. Indeed, the plaintiff in a
later affidavit, sworn on 3 November 1998, concedes that the dates demonstrated
by the results of
the various searches conducted by the defendant and by Sydney
Clayton Birchall (the son of the defendant) "are most probably correct".

<P>

14	The plaintiff in paragraph 3 of that affidavit then offers what he suggests
to be the correct chronology, which includes a departure
of his father on the
<i>Orcades</i> on 29 April 1950 and his return on the <i>Strathmore</i> on 20
September 1950; a departure of his father and the deceased on the <i>Orsova</i>
in November 1957; a departure of his father and the deceased on a return trip
on the <i>Arcadia</i> on 12 January 1959 and their return to Sydney on that
trip in February 1959. 
<P>

15	That chronology offered in his affidavit of 3 November 1998 is totally
inconsistent with the case originally advanced by the
plaintiff. If that
chronology is to be relied upon, then the plaintiff must be taken to be
asserting that he was residing with his
father and the deceased for at least
six years --- from 1944 until April 1950 --- or, possibly, for more than
thirteen years ---
from 1944 until November 1957. 
<P>

16	Neither of those periods is consistent with the case originally propounded
by the plaintiff in his affidavit evidence before
3 November 1998, or in the
letter of 20 May 1997 from his solicitors before the institution of the
proceedings (Exhibit 9), or in
the opening address of his Counsel at the
commencement of the hearing, or in the written statement made by the plaintiff
on the first
day of the hearing, which was admitted into evidence as Exhibit A,
or in the written submissions of his Counsel at the conclusion
of the evidence.
Further, the plaintiff under cross-examination, said that he still maintained
"till I die" that his father went
overseas in the mid-1940's.
<P>

17	Throughout the hearing the case for the plaintiff was conducted upon the
basis that the period during which he was residing with
his father and the
deceased was a period of about thirteen months, commencing immediately upon the
removal of the plaintiff's father
and the deceased from Sydney to Cooranbong,
and that throughout most of that thirteen month period the plaintiff was a
pupil at Cooranbong
High School. 
<P>

18	However, it is impossible to reconcile the various versions of the
plaintiff's evidence. Even his oral evidence given on the
first day of the
hearing, 23 November 1998, included the assertion that until his father moved
to Cooranbong the plaintiff had been
residing with his grandparents, an
assertion not previously made in any of the earlier evidence of the plaintiff,
and an assertion
which was inconsistent with the plaintiff's written statement
made only a few hours earlier on 23 November 1998 (Exhibit A).
<P>

19	The evidence given by the plaintiff concerning his activities (for example,
concerning his conduct of the Cooranbong Bus Service
and his attending to the
banking) during the alleged absence of his father and the deceased from
Cooranbong in 1946 is clearly wrong.

<P>

20	It is appropriate here to record that, despite such assertions made by him
under cross-examination as "I claim I've got a very
good memory" and "I
consider my memory very good" and the statement that he had a "very fair memory
of the living circumstances at
Cooranbong in the 1940s", I regarded the
plaintiff as a totally unreliable witness in relation to those events of more
than half
a century ago. Further, he presented himself as a very
self-opinionated person.
<P>

21	In the letter dated 20 May 1997 from the solicitors for the plaintiff to the
solicitors for the defendant, before the institution
of the present proceedings
(Exhibit 9), it was stated, upon the instructions of the plaintiff, that he
resided with the deceased
and his father from the time of their removal to
Avondale Road, Cooranbong in 1944 until the plaintiff "left school at the end
of
1945, having completed the intermediate ccertificate".
<P>

22	An inquiry of the Board of Studies of New South Wales concerning the
allegation that the plaintiff had obtained the Intermediate
Certificate at
Cooranbong High School elicited a response dated 5 January 1998 from the
president of the Board of Studies (annexure
L to the affidavit of Sydney Frank
Birchall sworn 23 June 1998) that the Board had searched not only Cooranbong
High School but also
schools located at Avondale, Wyong, Newcastle, Maitland,
Hamilton, Morisset, Swansea, Tighes Hill, Cooks Hill and Gosford, but that
the
Board could "find no listing for Mr [John Valentine] Macleay in the years
1943-44-45". The inference to be drawn is that, even
if the plaintiff did
attend Cooranbong High School (or one of the other schools referred to in the
foregoing letter) at the relevant
period, he did not receive the Intermediate
Certificate.
<P>

23	A considerable body of affidavit evidence was filed on behalf of various
contemporaries, school friends, acquaintances, and kinsfolk
of the parties,
relevant to the question of whether the plaintiff did or did not reside with
his father and the deceased at their
house property at Avondale Road,
Cooranbong (it appearing that the precise location of that residence was at 20
Avondale Road). None
of the witnesses in this case, apart from the plaintiff
and the defendant, were cross-examined. It is abundantly obvious from the
affidavit evidence of the other witnesses that the plaintiff did not, as he
alleges, reside with his father and the deceased for
the period of thirteen
months at 20 Avondale Road, Cooranbong. At the period for which the plaintiff
alleges that he was residing
with his father and the deceased, I am satisfied
that he was, in fact, residing not with them, but with his grandparents, some
distance
away at Maitland Road, Cooranbong.
<P>

24	I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has established that, either at the
period which he alleges --- in about 1944-1945 ---
or at any other time, he was
a member of a household of which the deceased was a member.
<P>

25	Further, even if (contrary to the conclusion which I have just expressed) I
were to be satisfied that the plaintiff had been,
either at the foregoing time,
as alleged by him, or at any other time, resident with his father and the
deceased at 20 Avondale Road,
Cooranbong, the evidence of dependency is skimpy
in the extreme. The only evidence in that regard is that, according to the
plaintiff,
the deceased attended to the normal household duties of cooking,
cleaning and washing whilst he resided with her and his father,
and that from
time to time she gave the plaintiff money to buy shirts and other clothes,
continuing to do so until his first marriage
in September 1952. 
<P>

26	Throughout the relevant period the deceased was not in employment. The
plaintiff's father acquired an omnibus and commenced to
conduct a bus service
shortly after his arrival at Cooranbong. The plaintiff's father was the
breadwinner of the marriage of himself
and the deceased. The family was
maintained from the income derived from the Cooranbong Bus Service. Even if the
plaintiff had been
residing with his father and the deceased, it seems to me
that, whilst the plaintiff was at school (which, according to the plaintiff,
he
was for most of the thirteen month period) he could not be regarded as being
dependent upon the deceased, but rather that, if
a member of the household, he
would have been dependent upon his own natural father, the late Alfred John
Macleay. 
<P>

27	When the plaintiff left school he commenced employment with the Cooranbong
Bus Service, working as a driver until that business
was sold about six or
seven years later. Once the plaintiff commenced employment and began to receive
wages, it does not appear that
he was dependent upon anyone --- certainly not
upon the deceased. Receipt of occasional gifts of money for clothing by a young
adult
in full time employment do not constitute dependency of any degree. 
<P>

28	When the plaintiff went to reside with his grandmother --- on his version he
was working at the time --- he says that his father
and the deceased paid for
his board and that he bought clothes and any necessities from his salary. It is
difficult to understand
why it would have been necessary for the plaintiff's
board with his grandmother to have been paid by anyone but himself if he were,
as he asserts, already an employee of the Cooranbong Bus Service at the time
when he went to reside with his grandmother. I am not
persuaded that, in fact,
any board was paid by anyone else to his grandmother on behalf of the plaintiff
whilst he was employment.
But even if this somewhat unlikely version of events
asserted by the plaintiff be accepted, it is obvious that the source of any
such board was the income derived from the Cooranbong Bus Service. That income
was earned not by the deceased, but by the plaintiff's
own father. 
<P>

29	It will be appreciated that for the plaintiff to have the standing to bring
the present proceedings he must establish that he
comes within both limbs of
the definition of eligible person contained within paragraph (d) ---- that is,
that he was at some time
wholly or partly dependent upon the deceased and that
he was at that particular time or at any other time a member of a household
of
which the deceased was a member. I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has
established either of those limbs. 
<P>

30	The conclusion which I have just expressed is sufficient to dispose of the
present proceedings. 
<P>

31	Nevertheless, I consider it appropriate, in the event that I be wrong in the
foregoing conclusion, and in the event that the
plaintiff might establish that
he is, in fact, an eligible person, that I should refer to the evidence in
support of the substantive
claim of the plaintiff, and set forth my views
concerning that claim.
<P>

32	According to the plaintiff he worked for his father in the Cooranbong Bus
Service from the time he left school until that business
was sold by his father
about six or seven years later. Although he did not expressly state when he
obtained his driver's licence,
the suggestion appears to be that it was
immediately after the plaintiff left school. That event appears to have
occurred at the
end of 1945. Accordingly, upon that basis, the plaintiff would
have worked as a driver for the Cooranbong Bus Service until about
1951 or
1952. Those dates accord with the plaintiff's evidence that the removal of his
father and the deceased from Cooranbong to
Sydney was some time in the early
1950s.
<P>

33	The plaintiff married in September 1952, by which time it would appear that
he was already living in Sydney. After his marriage
the plaintiff and his wife
lived for a period at McMahon's Point. 
<P>

34	Although the plaintiff in paragraph 8 of his affidavit of 18 August 1997
says that in the early 1950s his father and the deceased
"sold their home at
Cooranbong", it was noted during the hearing as an agreed fact that at all
material times the house at 20 Avondale
Road, Cooranbong was owned by Elizabeth
Macleay, the mother of Alfred Macleay. That is, at no time were the plaintiff's
father and
the deceased the owners of the house property at 20 Avondale Road.
In consequence, the assertion by the plaintiff in his affidavit
evidence that
they --- his father and the deceased --- had sold that home must be treated as
incorrect.
<P>

35	Upon moving to Sydney the plaintiff's father and the deceased purchased land
at 21 King William Street, Greenwich, upon which
they proceeded to have
constructed a house. That is the house property which ultimately constituted
the chief asset in the estate
of the deceased. During the period whilst that
house was in the course of construction it would appear that the plaintiff's
father
and the deceased occupied as their residence a large garage on that
site.
<P>

36	Upon moving to Sydney the plaintiff's father acquired, by purchase, a taxi
licence, and the plaintiff worked for him as a driver
for about nine months.
<P>

37	According to the plaintiff, he did not like living in Sydney, so after his
marriage he and his wife returned to the Central Coast
area. At that time,
according to the plaintiff, his father and the deceased gave him &#163;6,000 in
order to buy a taxi plate, and
another &#163;15,000 in order to purchase a
house property at 46 Bridge Street, Morisset. The plaintiff by his first
marriage had
five children. 
<P>

38	The plaintiff said that he was then self-employed as a taxi driver for about
five or six years in the Morisset area. He then
entered employment with the New
South Wales Electricity Commission as a depot attendant, based at Vales Point,
then at Munmorah,
and then at Eraring. The plaintiff was employed by the
Electricity Commission for about thirty years. In his affidavit of 3 November
1998 the plaintiff says that he commenced employment with the Electricity
Commission "in about 1962". Either that date is incorrect,
or the period that
the plaintiff worked as a taxi driver is incorrect, since if the plaintiff was
self-employed as a taxi driver
for about five or six years from his return to
the Central Coast in 1953, that would bring his self-employment as a taxi
driver up
to 1958 or 1959. There would then be a gap of at least two years
unexplained if he did not commence with the Electricity Commission
until about
1962.
<P>

39	According to the plaintiff, whilst his children were young, he was in the
habit of seeing his father and the deceased at least
once a month, generally on
a Sunday. I gather that that contact was by way of visits of the plaintiff and
his family to the residence
at Greenwich. Then, as his children grew older, the
plaintiff's contact with his father and the deceased became less frequent,
diminishing
to once every six to eight weeks. The plaintiff said that his
father and the deceased spent long holidays in Queensland, especially
in winter
months. He also said that the deceased made clothes for his daughter Christine
(who had been born on 15 April 1956), and
that she gave monetary presents of a
couple of pounds when they visited the deceased and his father.
<P>

40	The plaintiff's father died in 1976. According to the plaintiff, he left an
undated will. Under that will the plaintiff's father
gave a legacy of
&#163;1,000 to the plaintiff, and the balance of his estate to the deceased.
The evidence is silent as to whether
that will (a copy whereof is annexed to
the plaintiff's affidavit of 18 November 1997) was ever admitted to Probate ---
or, indeed,
whether that was even the last will of the plaintiff's father. It
would appear, however, that the house property at King William
Street,
Greenwich was held by the plaintiff's father and the deceased as joint tenants,
and that that property passed by survivorship
to the deceased. According to the
plaintiff, he did not ever receive the legacy of &#163;1,000 left to him by his
father. No explanation
was offered as why the plaintiff did not receive that
legacy, or whether he had ever requested payment of that legacy.
<P>

41	After the death of his father the plaintiff had no contact with the deceased
for about ten years. In the interim the plaintiff
had divorced and had
remarried, on 1 December 1978. He had no children by his second marriage. 
<P>

42	According to the plaintiff, the deceased telephoned him in about 1986, and
contact between himself and the deceased was thus
resumed. He said that he
visited the deceased as a result of her telephone call, and subsequently
brought his wife to visit her.
He said that they then saw the deceased about
every two or three months. 
<P>

43	The plaintiff said that, however, in the last eighteen months of her life he
saw the deceased less frequently than he had seen
her from about 1986 until
about the beginning of 1994. This was, according to the plaintiff, on account
of an incident involving
a gun, which the plaintiff received from the deceased,
but which the deceased then requested be returned to her. That incident
occupied
a not insubstantial amount of the affidavit evidence. However, it does
not seem to me to have any significant bearing on any of the
matters in issue
in these proceedings, except to explain the lack of contact during that last
period of the lifetime of the deceased.
<P>

44	The plaintiff said that for a period the deceased would hang up when
attempted to telephone her. However, according to the plaintiff,
that situation
eventually came to an end, and he continued to conduct a telephone conversation
with the deceased at least once a
month until her death. 
<P>

45	The plaintiff retired from employment in October 1986. He and his wife had
until 1995 been residing at 16 Sunrise Avenue, Budgewoi.
However, in July 1995
they sold that house and acquired what has been described as a relocatable
home, situate at Lakeland Park,
Buff Point.
<P>

46	The present income of the plaintiff consists of a joint pension received by
himself and his wife in a total amount of $620 a
fortnight (which amount
includes $20 as rental assistance). They have no liabilities. The present joint
assets of the plaintiff and
his wife are stated to be:
<P>

	Relocatable home, having an estimated value of between $67,000 and $70,000
<P>

	1987 Volvo motor car, having an estimated value of $10,000.
<P>

	1979 Datsun motor car, having an estimated value of $500.
<P>

	Savings, about $4,000.
<P>

	Furniture tools and the like.
<P>

47	The plaintiff is a Lieutenant Commander in the Coastal Patrol at Tuggerah
Lakes Division, which covers an area from Terrigal
to Swansea, on the Central
Coast. The Coastal Patrol is involved in search and rescue, and, according to
the plaintiff, he is required
to do a considerable quantity of travelling at
his own expense. He is also required, at his own expense, to pay for uniforms,
petrol
and telephone bills, since his involvement in the Coastal Patrol is in
the nature of volunteer work.
<P>

48	According to the plaintiff, he has suffered from problems with his back,
arising out of a work accident in March 1985, whilst
he was employed by the
Electricity Commission. There has been placed before the Court an extract from
the reasons for judgment given
in the District Court of New South Wales at
Gosford in respect to the compensation which the plaintiff received for that
work accident.

<P>

49	In the course of that judgment the Judge said that the plaintiff was unable
to sit or stand for long periods, and had problems
in driving a car; that
meaningful bending, stooping and lifting caused pain over and above that which
he normally suffered, and he
was forced to rest in bed; that because of
discomfort he had had to abandon sexual intercourse, and such activities as
gardening,
fishing, and that his sport of pistol shooting was now beyond him.
According to the Judge, a significant difficulty was the spontaneous
giving way
of his right leg which had caused him to fall on some eight occasions. The
Judge concluded by saying that he considered
that the effects of the
plaintiff's accident would "impinge upon his capacity to enjoy life,
indefinitely".
<P>

50	I would here interpolate that the foregoing statements made by the Judge in
awarding to the plaintiff $165,167 (less the total
amount which he had received
under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act</i> 1987</a> in the sum of $20,901),
resulting in a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $144,276, are not
entirely consistent with the energetic
(and apparently enjoyable) physical
activities described by the plaintiff in his involvement with the Coastal
Patrol.
<P>

51	The present residence of the plaintiff stands upon land which the plaintiff
and his wife lease from Lakeland Park Pty. Limited.
They pay $169 a week rent
for that land, which amount includes water rates. However, they must in
addition pay for their own electricity,
gas and telephone. As far as I can
gather, the ownership by the plaintiff and his wife of their relocatable home
gives to them, subject
to payment of the rent, a right to occupy the land upon
which that structure stands. Apparently that home had already been in that
location for seven years when it was acquired by the plaintiff and his wife in
1995.
<P>

52	In the period from the beginning of 1980 until he acquired the relocatable
home in 1995 the plaintiff (either alone or conjointly
with his wife) had
purchased and sold no fewer than five separate house properties, each being
sold for an amount in excess of its
purchase price. The differences between the
purchase price and the sale price of those properties (as disclosed in Exhibit
8) were
respectively: $15,000; $44,000; $37,000; $3,000; $10,000. (It will be
appreciated, however, that those figures represent differences
between gross
amounts.)
<P>

53	The last house property which was owned by the plaintiff before he acquired
his present residence was that situate at 106 Sunrise
Avenue, Budgewoi. That
property had been purchased for $125,000 in November 1991 and was sold for
$135,000 in July 1995. According
to the plaintiff, after discharge of a
mortgage of $16,000, and payment of various adjustments, costs and
disbursements in respect
to that house property, he and his wife received a net
amount of $103,975. That amount was applied by them to the cost of the
acquisition
of the relocatable home at Lakeland Park ($58,000), payment of
Stamp Duty and other disbursements, refurnishing, recarpeting and
painting the
relocatable home, installation of a bath, benchtops and cupboards in the
kitchen, acquisition of a new refrigerator
and construction of a carport. 
<P>

54	The plaintiff's wife suffers certain health problems. They include chronic
back pain, anaemia and depression. She underwent one
mastectomy in 1988 and
another in 1991, consequent upon cancer of the breast. 
<P>

55	In paragraph 15 of his affidavit of 18 August 1997 the plaintiff sets forth
how he would expend any moneys which might be awarded
to him in the present
proceedings. His intention is, firstly, to purchase a replacement motor
vehicle, such as a Honda Civic automatic,
costing about $26,000. Then to
undergo various chiropractic, medical and dental procedures (totalling about
$5,000). He proposes
to buy replacement furniture, furnishings and other items
for his residence ($10,000). The plaintiff expressed a desire to purchase
what
he described as "a proper home", for which he estimates, after making allowance
for the sale of his present relocatable home,
he would require about $150,000.
Because of his involvement in the Coastal Patrol he says that he would need to
live near the beach.
The plaintiff also stated that, apart from his Coastal
Patrol activities, he enjoyed fishing as a pastime, and that he would like
to
purchase a boat for his use in the patrol work and also for fishing. A boat
suitable for such purpose would cost about $12,000.
The plaintiff expressed
concern that his wife's back condition might require surgery in the near
future. Neither he nor his wife
is a member of a private health fund.
<P>

56	Upon my calculations the foregoing amounts which the plaintiff would wish to
expend out of moneys he hopes to be awarded to him
in the present proceedings
would total in excess of $200,000.
<P>

57	Since the plaintiff is an eligible person, if at all, only within paragraph
(d) of the definition of that phrase, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9</a> (1) of the Act is called into
operation. That subsection provides,
<P>

	Where an application is made for an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 7</a> by an eligible
person who is such a person by reason only of paragraph (c) or (d) of the
definition of "eligible person" in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6</a> (1), the Court shall first
determine whether, in its opinion, having regard to all the circumstances of
the case (whether past or
present), there are factors which warrant the making
of the application and shall refuse to proceed with the determination of the
application and to make the order unless it is satisfied that there are those
factors.
<P>

58	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the following matters were
factors which warranted the making of the present
application. Firstly, the
plaintiff was the only child of his father, and the deceased appears to have
had no children. Further,
so it was submitted, there appears to be no other
person, apart from the plaintiff, who is an eligible person in relation to the
deceased. 
<P>

59	The plaintiff also relies upon the situation consequent upon the death of
his father on 27 December 1976 as constituting a factor
warranting his making
of the present application. 
<P>

60	I have already recorded that the plaintiff's father is said to have left a
will under which the deceased received the entirety
of his estate, apart from a
legacy of &#163;1,000 to the plaintiff. A copy of such an undated will is
Annexure A to the affidavit
of the plaintiff sworn 9 November 1997. I have
already recorded that the interest of the plaintiff's father in the house
property
at King William Street, Greenwich, passed to the deceased not pursuant
to the provisions of that (or any) will, but by survivorship,
since she and the
plaintiff's father held that property as joint tenants. A Notice of Death dated
20 July 1977 (Annexure B to that
affidavit) appears to have been filed by the
deceased on 21 March 1978. 
<P>

61	There is no evidence that the original of the undated will annexed to the
plaintiff's affidavit was ever admitted to Probate.
It will be appreciated that
one of the assets held by the plaintiff's father was the taxi and its
registration plates which subsequently
became a significant asset in the estate
of the deceased. It would be surprising if that asset had passed to the
deceased without
there having been a grant of Probate of the will of the
plaintiff's father and some formal transfer of that asset to the deceased
pursuant to that will. Yet no effort has been made by the plaintiff to present
evidence concerning whether or not any will of his
father was admitted to
Probate, and, in particular, whether or not such will was the original of which
a copy is Annexure A to the
affidavit sworn by him on 18 November 1997. 
<P>

62	It appears now to be a complaint of the plaintiff, and to be relied upon as
a factor warranting the making of the present application,
that the plaintiff
did not receive, and did not make any claim for, payment of the legacy of
&#163;1,000 provided for in that undated
will. Further, the plaintiff relies
upon the fact that he did not in any way challenge any testamentary provisions
which his father
might have made, and that he did not make any claim against
the estate of his father under the <i>Testator's Family Maintenance and
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/goia1916231/" class="autolink_findacts">Guardianship of Infants Act </i>1916</a> (the statutory predecessor to the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act </i>1982</a>).
<P>

63	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the events following the
death of his father reflect on the nature of the relationship
between the
plaintiff and the deceased, the plaintiff's actions (or lack of actions) being
consistent with his regarding the deceased
as a person standing in the place of
his mother, and his recognition of her position as widow of the deceased, and
further, that
the entirety of the funds upon which he as the only child of the
deceased might have regarded himself as having some form of a moral
claim were
allowed by him to pass without impediment to the deceased. It was submitted
that it is those assets which now constitute
the significant part of the estate
of the deceased.
<P>

64	Persons who are eligible persons only within paragraphs (c) and (d) of the
definition are not generally regarded as natural objects
of testamentary
recognition by a testator. It is for that reason, apparently, that the
requirement of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 9</a> (1) has application to such eligible persons (see
<i>Re Fulop</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20679" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 679</a> at 681; <i>Churton v Christian</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20NSWLR%20241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13
NSWLR 241).</a>
<P>

65	Often a stepchild of a testator has had a relationship with the stepparent
no different in practical terms from the relationship
between a natural child
and a biological parent. In such a case the applicant stepchild usually has
little problem in establishing
the existence of factors which warrant the
making of the application.
<P>

66	In the instant case, however, the relationship between the plaintiff and the
deceased, even upon the version given by the plaintiff
--- the accuracy of
which I greatly doubt --- was hardly a close one. Upon the plaintiff's evidence
he was a member of the same household
with the deceased and his father for a
period of thirteen months more than half a century ago. His subsequent contact
with the deceased
from the time he was aged in his mid or late teens until he
was aged in his twenties appears essentially to have been contact as
result of
his being employed by his father as a driver for the Cooranbong Bus Service.

<P>

67	Once the plaintiff married, at the age of 24 in 1952, his contact with his
father and the deceased diminished appreciably. After
his father and the
deceased came to Sydney in the early 1950s, the plaintiff appears to have
remained in Sydney for only about nine
months. Once the plaintiff moved back to
Morisset in about 1952, his contact with the deceased over the next forty-four
years was
slight. Indeed, even on the plaintiff's own version, for about ten
years from 1976, when his father died, until about 1986 there
was no contact
whatsoever between them. For a further period of about eighteen months
preceding the death of the deceased there was
little contact, and, indeed, for
a not inconsiderable part of that period there was a total estrangement.
<P>

68	It is also relevant, in considering the various matters relied upon by the
plaintiff as constituting factors which warrant the
making of the present
application against the estate of the deceased, that the plaintiff's father in
about 1952, shortly after the
plaintiff's marriage, gave to the plaintiff two
very substantial gifts, being &#163;6,000 to buy a taxi plate and &#163;15,000
to
buy a house at Morisset. Those amounts (nominally equivalent to $12,000 and
$30,000 respectively) are not insignificant in the context
of present values.
But in the context of values in the early 1950s they are gifts of outstanding
and extraordinary generosity. The
defendant has calculated (using ABS Consumer
Price Index figures) that &#163;21,000 in, say, 1954, is the purchasing power
equivalent
of $418,000 in today's money. I am in agreement with the submission
on behalf of the defendant that those amounts given to the plaintiff
by his
father in the early 1950s constitute an extraordinarily generous gift by any
standard --- thereby the plaintiff shortly after
his marriage received from his
father the gift of a significant house property and the gift of an income
producing business. 
<P>

69	Those gifts must be taken into consideration when approaching the submission
of the plaintiff that the events consequent upon
the death of his father
constitute factors which now warrant the making of his present application
against the estate of the deceased.
Had the plaintiff in 1976 attempted to make
some claim against the estate of his father under the <i>Testator's Family
Maintenance Act, </i> I have little doubt that the fact of the gifts to which I
have just referred would have resulted in such an application being dismissed.
However, it is not necessary for me here to express any concluded view
concerning the fate of such a hypothetical application in
the late 1970s. It is
necessary for me here only to express a conclusion as to whether there are
factors which warrant the making
of the present application. 
<P>

70	I do not consider that any of the matters relied upon by the plaintiff
constitute factors which warrant the making of this present
application against
the estate of his stepmother, with whom his contact (largely from his own
choice) was either non-existent or
minimal for the last twenty years of the
lifetime of the deceased, and was not very great for the preceding thirty-three
years. A
stepson whose relationship with his stepmother consisted of contact of
the foregoing nature over a period of fifty-three years (together
with, upon
his assertion, living in the same household with her for thirteen months well
over half a century ago) would not generally
be regarded as a natural object of
testamentary recognition by the stepmother.
<P>

71	I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has established any factors which
warrant the making of the present application. That conclusion,
of itself, is
sufficient to dispose of the present proceedings. 
<P>

72	However, in the event that (contrary to the conclusion which I have just
expressed) it were to be held that there were factors
which warrant the making
of the present application, then it would be necessary for me to proceed to a
consideration of the substantive
claim of the plaintiff for an order for
provision for his maintenance and advancement in life out of the estate of the
deceased.
<P>

73	In this regard the Court must look to the present need of the plaintiff. It
cannot be emphasised too strongly that a person who
makes an application for
provision out of the estate of a testator has an obligation to place before the
Court as frankly and as
fully as possible all available information concerning
his financial and material circumstances (which circumstances, of course,
include those of any spouse with whom the applicant is living). 
<P>

74	I have already adverted to the various real property transactions of the
plaintiff and his present wife. Even upon the somewhat
unlikely version of the
plaintiff that a net amount of only $103,975 was received by them from the sale
of 106 Sunrise Avenue, Budgewoi
(from a sale price of $135,000), and that a
total of $74,500 was expended on the purchase of and improvements to their
present residence,
that still leaves a surplus of about $29,500 (of which only
$10,500, for the purchase of a motor car, has been accounted for). But
the
plaintiff's assertion as to the amount of the net proceeds of sale is clearly
wrong, since he has not taken into consideration
the deposit of $13,500. The
net amount actually received by him and his wife was $117,475, and the surplus
after acquiring and outfitting
their present home was $43,000. Apart from the
purchase of a motor car, the plaintiff has not revealed what he did with the
balance
of that amount.
<P>

75	The plaintiff lists the value of assets owned by himself and his wife as
being an amount totalling between $81,500 and $84,500
(affidavit of the
plaintiff sworn 18 August 1997, paragraph 13), consisting principally of the
relocatable home at Buff Point, worth
between $67,000 and $70,000. I am in
agreement with the submission on behalf of the defendant that, even after
allowing for the financial
impact of the plaintiff's divorce in 1978, this
appears to be an unusually poor financial position. Especially so, since the
plaintiff
had received extremely generous gifts from his father in the early
1950s (which provided him with a house and an income producing
business); and
thereafter he had thirty years of paid employment; received a superannuation
benefit of $38,436 in 1987; and received
a verdict of $144,276 in 1989 as a
result of an injury at work. In this latter regard, it will be appreciated that
the plaintiff
had already received an amount of $20,901 representing the
difference between the foregoing figure of $144,276 and $165,177 (to which
he
had established an entitlement), that difference representing workers
compensation payments and out of pocket expenses. In addition,
he received a
further $9,000, representing interest on his judgment pending the disposal, in
his favour, of an appeal. 
<P>

76	If the assertion by the plaintiff (affidavit of 3 November 1998, paragraph
12) that his solicitors in June 1989 accounted to
him for the sum of
$105,181.56 is intended to convey that that was the only amount received by him
from his verdict, then it would
appear that the plaintiff is here attempting to
mislead the Court. The terms of settlement disposing of the appeal (annexure D
to
that affidavit), clearly reveal that part of the judgment had already been
paid. The statement of account from the plaintiff's solicitors
(annexure E)
deals only with the balance of the judgment moneys. The plaintiff has not
revealed what happened to the remaining $39,000.
<P>

77	Thus, after receiving a superannuation benefit of more than $38,000 in 1987,
an actual payment of more than $105,000 in 1989,
and various amounts
(representing the difference between the sale price and the purchase price on
five separate properties) between
January 1980 and November 1991, the
plaintiff, upon his evidence, now has as his only assets, jointly with his
wife, a relocatable
home purchased in 1995 (having a present estimated value of
no more than $70,000), two motor cars (having a total estimated value
of
$10,500), and savings of about $4,000. 
<P>

78	The plaintiff has not chosen to inform the Court of when and for what price
he sold the house at Morisset (which must have been
a truly palatial
establishment to have cost &#163;15,000 at Morisset in the early 1950s).
Neither has he informed the Court of when
and for how much he disposed of the
taxi plate (which also would have had a very significant value in the 1950s).
He has chosen not
to disclose what happened to the proceeds of the sale of
those assets.
<P>

79	I have already referred to the failure of the plaintiff to account for most
of the surplus of $43,000 remaining from the sale
of the Budgewoi house after
the acquisition and outfitting of his present residence. Further, there remains
totally unexplained what
happened to the $38,436 which the plaintiff received
by way of superannuation in 1987. (It certainly did not go in its entirety to
the purchase of a residence at 229 Buff Point Avenue, Buff Point, which was
purchased on 17 July 1987 for $23,000 and was sold two
and a half years later,
on 21 February 1990 for $60,000.) Further, there remains unexplained what
happened to the moneys received
by the plaintiff arising out of his claims
consequent upon his work injury, totalling $165,177, plus interest of $9,000.

<P>

80	I am far from satisfied that the plaintiff has fully and frankly disclosed
to the Court full and complete details of his financial
and material
circumstances.
<P>

81	But even if the assets stated by the plaintiff constitute the entirety of
the assets of himself and his wife, it is clear that
they are residing in
comfortable circumstances, and that they have security of accommodation. Their
conjoint income from their pensions
is adequate for their needs. 
<P>

82	The list of wishes of how the plaintiff would expend any moneys which he
might receive in the present proceedings is no more
than that --- a wish list,
and a most inflated one at that. Most of the items in that list are pure
extravagances. For example, the
plaintiff and his wife sold their residence at
Budgewoi as recently as July 1995 for $135,000, and after discharging the
mortgage,
they had a net amount of $117,475 from the proceeds of sale. They
then purchased a relocatable home for $58,000, and, according to
the plaintiff,
expended the difference between that amount and $104,000 in effecting
improvements and refurbishments to that relocatable
home. Yet two years later
the plaintiff claims an additional $150,000 from the estate of the deceased in
order to "purchase a proper
home for my wife and I to live in", and, in
addition, he wants a further $10,000 for new furniture and related items ---
despite
having purchased furniture for the relocatable home in 1995. Presumably
those 1995 purchases were adequate for the circumstances
and needs of a retired
couple. They now wish to purchase other furniture and related items, of a
nature unspecified.
<P>

83	I have already referred to the inconsistencies between the plaintiff's state
of health and limitation upon his physical activities
asserted by him in his
Court proceedings in 1989 (and for which he was duly compensated), and the
active physical life which the
plaintiff in his evidence describes himself as
pursuing and desiring to pursue, which requires an additional new motor
vehicle, a
residence by the beach, a boat.
<P>

84	I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has established that he has any
relevant need which his present financial and material
circumstances are not
capable of meeting. That conclusion is of itself sufficient to dispose of his
present application.
<P>

85	But if (contrary to the conclusion which I have just expressed) the
plaintiff be regarded as having established some relevant
need, then it would
become necessary for me to proceed to a consideration of any appropriate order
for provision which might be made
in favour of the plaintiff.
<P>

86	In this regard, the Court is precluded, by section 9 (2) of the Act, from
making an order under section 7 in favour of an eligible
person unless it is
satisfied that --- 
<P>

	(a) the provision (if any) made in favour of the eligible person by the
deceased person either during his lifetime or out of his
estate....
<P>

	is, at the time the Court is determining whether or not to make such an order,
inadequate for the proper maintenance, education
and advancement in life of the
eligible person.
<P>

87	By her will the deceased gave to the plaintiff a legacy of $5,000. That
legacy has not yet been paid. But, when paid, it will
provide a fund in the
nature of a windfall for the plaintiff, which will be available to effect a
slight general improvement in his
lifestyle, and will be available to meet any
contingencies. He has no liabilities or pressing present needs.
<P>

88	Further, to the extent that the plaintiff asserted that his dependence
during any period whilst he resided with his father and
the deceased was a
dependence jointly upon his father and the deceased --- despite the fact that
the deceased was not in employment
and had no income and the fact that the
breadwinner of the family was the plaintiff's father --- then it could be
argued that the
extremely generous financial benefits given to the plaintiff
shortly after his marriage --- totalling &#163;21,000 in the early 1950s
---
could be regarded not merely as a gift from the plaintiff's father alone but as
a gift jointly from the plaintiff's father and
the deceased. To that extent it
could be argued that those gifts should be taken into account by the Court in
the making of any order
for provision in favour of the plaintiff. In the light
of my earlier conclusions herein, however, it is not necessary for me to
express
any final view concerning whether any benefits to the plaintiff from
the deceased, either by her will or during her lifetime, should
be limited to
the legacy of $5,000, or should also include part or all of the gifts totalling
&#163;21,000 made to him in the early
1950s.
<P>

89	In approaching any claim for an order for provision it is necessary for the
Court to consider that claim in the light of any
competing claims upon the
testamentary bounty of the deceased. In the instant case the only competing
claims upon the testamentary
bounty of the deceased are those of the various
other beneficiaries referred to in the will --- being the plaintiff's own four
sons
as to the taxi licence (which is a very significant asset in the estate of
the deceased), and the defendant and the two nieces of
the deceased as
residuary beneficiaries.
<P>

90	No evidence has been placed before the Court concerning the financial and
material circumstances of those other beneficiaries
named in the will of the
deceased. Accordingly, it is not necessary for any order for provision an
entitlement to which the plaintiff
might otherwise have established to be
reduced, or even extinguished, in consequence of the financial and material
circumstances
of those with competing claims upon the testamentary bounty of
the deceased. 
<P>

91	However, even if, in the event that the plaintiff were to establish an
entitlement to an order for provision out of the estate
of the deceased
(contrary to the views which I have already expressed), I would, in the
exercise of my discretion, order that any
such provision be paid out of the
asset constituted by the taxi licence held by the deceased, which under her
will passes to the
four sons of the plaintiff.
<P>

92	I summarise therefore my foregoing views as follows. 
<P>

93	The plaintiff has not established that he was ever a member of the same
household as the deceased, or that he was ever dependent
upon the deceased.
Accordingly, he has not established that he is an eligible person in relation
to the deceased.
<P>

94	The plaintiff has not established that there are factors which warrant the
making of the present application.
<P>

95	The plaintiff has not established need in any relevant sense. What the
plaintiff claims in no more than a grossly inflated wish
list. The plaintiff
has not established an entitlement to an order for provision out of the estate
of his stepmother, with whom,
largely by his own choice, his relationship
throughout more than fifty years was at times non-existent, and other times
slight.
<P>

96	The plaintiff received very considerable benefits of a financial nature from
his father during his father's lifetime. The plaintiff
receives a modest legacy
under the will of the deceased, and his four sons share in an extremely
significant asset (valued at almost
$262,000) under that will.
<P>

97	I have no hesitation in expressing my conclusion that the application of the
plaintiff is totally without merit and must be dismissed.
<P>

98	I make the following orders.
<P>

	1.	I order that the summons and the amended 	summons each be dismissed.
<P>

	2. 	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the 	defendant, such costs to
be on the party and party 	basis.
<P>

	3. 	I order that the defendant be entitled to recoup from 	the estate of the
late Doris Myra Macleay ("the 	deceased") the difference
between the foregoing
costs 	which he receives from the plaintiff and the costs of 	the defendant on
the indemnity basis. 
<P>

	4. 	The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
