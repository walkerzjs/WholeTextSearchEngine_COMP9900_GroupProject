Wednesday 31 March 1999
<P>

<b>4454/96 PAUL ANDREW CULLINGTON v KIN WAI LEE</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	MASTER MACREADY:  This is the hearing of a Notice of Motion brought by the
defendant and filed on 17 March 1999 which inter alia
seeks orders under s 76A
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> to compel the plaintiff to use his best endeavours to
procure the production of certain documents from overseas.  The determination
of the Motion has been referred by a Judge of the Court to a Master.  Only
paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 of that Motion were dealt with
before me.  These
paragraphs seek, inter alia, orders that defendant take all reasonable steps to
procure what are described as the
solicitor's documents and the KPMG documents.
These documents are specified in the schedule attached to the Motion.  In
respect of
that schedule the only items which are pressed are items numbered 5,
7 and 8.
<P>

2	There has been extensive discovery between the parties and no complaint is
made about the extent of that discovery.  The Motion
is founded upon the powers
of the Court to give directions for the speedy determination of the real
questions between the parties
to civil proceedings contained in s 76A of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a>.  The power of the Court to make the order as sought in the
Notice of Motion is not disputed.  It has been exercised in a number
of cases
an example of which is <b>Aetna Pacific Securities Ltd v Hongkong Bank of
Australia Ltd</b> Giles J 29 April 1993.  His Honour described the jurisdiction
to make the order in these terms:-
<P>

	"In this Court power equivalent to that in the rule upon which Marks J relied
may be found in s76A of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a>, by which the Court may give
such directions as it thinks fit, whether or not inconsistent with the rules,
"for the speedy determination
of the real questions between the parties to
civil proceedings". In my view s76A would authorise an order of the nature
sought by
the Bank in the second limb of its motion, although I do not think
that an unqualified direction to procure documents from a non-party
could be
justified: any direction would be in terms of taking reasonable steps. The Bank
does not, as its application was modified
during submissions, presently seek an
order that Aetna's proceedings be stayed unless and until it procures the
documents. I note
that Rogers J had in mind such a stay in Arhill Pty Ltd v
General Terminal Co Pty Ltd, but as at present advised it would seem to
me that
in general neither a stay pending production of documents by a non-party nor a
contingent stay in the event that they were
not produced would be appropriately
ordered at the time of an order that steps be taken to procure the documents.
That would be a
question for another time in the light of evidence of the steps
taken by the party and the responses to those steps.
<P>

	Aetna said that s76A would not authorise such an order because there could not
be done indirectly what could not be done directly,
namely, require a non-party
out of Australia to produce documents for the purpose of proceedings. I do not
think that correctly describes
the position. The order would be directed to a
party, and would not purport to bind the non-party. If the non-party chose not
to
provide documents to the party despite the latter's endeavours, it would
remain to decide what effect that would have upon the party's
conduct of the
proceedings. At one extreme, it might be that a parent which did not provide
critical documents to a wholly-owned
subsidiary through which it carried on
business in Australia would find that its subsidiary's claim was stayed, but if
that were
so it would be the result of proper consideration of the needs of
justice as between the parties to the proceedings."
<P>

3	Some of the factors obviously involved in the exercise of the discretion
include the means by which the party might obtain access
to the relevant
documents and the likelihood of it being able to do so.  In <b>Aetna </b>one of
the considerations which inclined Giles J not to make an order was that it may
have not been shown that production of the documents
was necessary for
disposing fairly of the proceedings.  
<P>

4	In order to consider these discretionary matters it is first necessary to
notice the nature of the case to the extent relevant.
 The proceedings concern
the resolution of various property matters following a termination of domestic
arrangements between the
two parties.
<P>

5	In paragraphs 8 to 22 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim filed by the
plaintiff there is a claim that the plaintiff is
entitled to the proceeds of
sale of a property which was purchased at Glenmore Road, Paddington.  The
defendant filed an Amended
Defence and Cross Claim which alleged that there was
a compromise of the entitlement to receive the proceeds of sale for the
Glenmore
Road property.  The defendant alleged that the compromise was that the
proceeds should be divided between the parties equally.  In
November 1997 there
was an Amended Reply which claims that the compromise was a result of economic
duress and therefore unenforceable.
 It is to this issue that the present
matter relates.  
<P>

6	The factual background is that the Glenmore Road property was purchased in
the name of the defendant on 27 March 1990 for $500,000.
 On 31 July 1995 the
plaintiff executed a contract to purchase a property at 36 Paultons Square,
London.  The settlement date was
agreed as 6 November 1995.  On 12 August 1995
the defendant sold the Glenmore Road property for $595,000 and thereafter on 20
and
25 September there was correspondence in which it is alleged that the
compromise, to which I have referred, was agreed.  
<P>

7	The plaintiff's evidence in the case deals with the proposed purchase of the
Paultons Square property for 740,000 pounds and the
plaintiff's expectation
that he would receive the full proceeds of the sale of the Glenmore Road
property.  The plaintiff claims
that the compromise was made when the defendant
knew that the plaintiff urgently needed the funds from the sale of the Glenmore
Road
property in order to complete the purchase of Paultons Square on 6
November 1995.  The plaintiff alleges that as a result of the
failure to
receive the whole of the proceeds it was necessary for him to obtain a separate
loan of some 400,000 pounds to purchase
the Paultons Square property which
ultimately, according to the plaintiff, was purchased with the proceeds of that
loan.
<P>

8	The defendant founds his claim to have the Court make the orders based upon
two propositions emerging from this background.  The
submissions are that it is
important to have access to documents dealing with -
<P>

9	(a) The actual source(s) of funds which the plaintiff used to purchase the
Paultons Square Property.
<P>

10	Such documents are said to be important because they would allow the
Defendant to test the following:
<P>

11	(i) Whether the plaintiff did, in fact, purchase the Paultons Square
Property using:
<P>

12	(AA) the funds referred to at paragraph 42 of his statement.
<P>

13	(BB) the loan which the plaintiff alleges he was forced to obtain from the
East Asia Finance Company Limited.
<P>

14	or used some other source of funds which he has not, as yet, disclosed.
<P>

15	(ii) Whether the plaintiff's financial position, on 26 September 1995, was
as he alleges at paragraph 51 of his statement, or
whether he had other assets
and sources of income which he has not disclosed.
<P>

16	(b) What income the Plaintiff had (in particular from KPMG) in the period
leading up to 26 September 1995.
<P>

17	Such documents are said to be important because they would allow the
defendant to test whether the plaintiff's financial position
was, on 26
September 1995, as he alleges at paragraph 51 of his the plaintiff's statement,
or whether he had other assets and sources
of income which he has not
disclosed.
<P>

18	Dealing with the last matter first it should be noted that the documents
which are sought and which are referred to in paragraphs
7 and 8 in the
Schedule to the Motion are fairly wide ranging.  They in effect capture every
document in KPMG or its service company
which in any way refers to the
remuneration of the plaintiff for the period 1993 to 1995.  When one goes to
the relevant evidence
at paragraph 51 of the plaintiff's statement one finds
the plaintiff saying, "I anticipated that I would receive distributions of
at
least 100,000 pounds from KPMG prior to the completion of the purchase of 34
Paulton Square.
<P>

19	Apparently the plaintiff had previously in his possession monthly accounts
of the KPMG partnership but these have been destroyed.
 However, the plaintiff
does give discovery of his bank account statements which show the deposit of a
salary for the relevant year,
namely, 1995.  In other words the defendant had
available to him details of what salary he did receive during that year.
Against
this background one has to judge whether the request for a wide range
of documents dealing with salary for three years is necessary
for a speedy and
just determination of the matters in issue in these proceedings.  Given the
nature of the information which is available
it seems to me that this request
is more in the nature of a "fishing expedition" and goes beyond the bounds of
what is necessary
for fairly disposing of the proceedings.
<P>

20	If one turns to item (a) above, namely, the source of the funds used to
purchase the Paulton Square property, a number of other
matters should be
noticed.  
<P>

21	The plaintiff has sworn to the fact that he has discovered all the
appropriate documents in his possession, custody or control
relating to these
matters.  That is not questioned and accordingly the only documents which might
not be in his possession, custody
or control would be documents on the
solicitor's conveyancing file which belong to the solicitor rather than the
plaintiff as the
solicitor's client.  
<P>

22	If one considers what these documents are likely to be it is clear that in
the ordinary course that these are likely to be documents
prepared by the
solicitor for his own benefit for which the client was not charged such as
inter-office memoranda, attendance notes
and account book entries.  Other
documents such as copies of letters written by the solicitor to third parties
and communications
from third parties to the solicitor clearly belong to the
client.  It should be noted that the plaintiff has sworn that there are
no
other documents which he has sent to his solicitor other than discovered
documents.  From this one can see that the area of possible
documentation is
small and really confined to notes made by the solicitor and account book
entries. 
<P>

23	I would have thought it is likely that the solicitors would provide the
plaintiff, if requested, copies of the documents which
are their documents on
the file which might touch upon the relevant matters.  There is, of course, no
ability to subpoena the solicitors
to produce the documents.  See <b>Arhill v
General Terminal Company Pty Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20545" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23 NSWLR 545.</a>  The discovered
documents which have been made available by the plaintiff apparently only
include one document which indicates a
source from which the plaintiff obtained
funds to purchase the property.  That is a document which shows the transfer of
130,000
pounds from the sale of the Glenmore Road property to the solicitors in
London.  Apparently there is disclosure of a number of documents
prior to 24
October 1995 indicating from where the plaintiff was planning to obtain funds
for the purchase of the Paulton Square
property but this does not deal with
what funds were used.  The documents which one would normally expect to be in
the control of
the solicitor rather than the client such as accounts and
ledgers would be likely to show the source of funds for the purchase.
Similarly
other documents belonging to the solicitors such as a settlement
statement are also very likely to deal with the source and application
of funds
for the purchase.  None of these have been discovered no doubt because they are
not in the possession or control of the
plaintiff.  
<P>

24	I would have thought that the actual funds used by the plaintiff for the
purchase would be a matter which is central to the claim
for economic duress.
The defendants would have a legitimate interest in knowing that information for
the purposes of meeting the
plaintiff's case.  There is only one file involved
so there would be little burden on the solicitors.  In my view it is
appropriate
that an order be made which may lead to the solicitor's documents
being available.
<P>

25	Accordingly the orders which I made are as follows:-
<P>

1.	That the plaintiff take all reasonable steps to procure the documents
referred in paragraph 5 of the Schedule attached to the
Amended Notice of
Motion filed 17 March 199.
<P>

2.	That the plaintiff on or before 15 May 1999 file and serve upon the
defendant a supplementary list of the documents obtained
by reason of their
compliance with order 1 above if any such documents are obtained.
<P>

3.	In the event that a list is not filed pursuant to order 2 above, that the
plaintiff on or before 15 May 1999 file and serve an
affidavit stating fully
his attempts to comply with the order made in 1 above.
<P>

4.	Paragraph 4 of the Notice of Motion filed 17 March 1999 is dismissed.
<P>

5.	The balance of the Notice of Motion is stood over to a date to be fixed.
<P>

I will hear argument as to costs.
