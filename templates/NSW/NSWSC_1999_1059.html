<P>

<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Imputations - capacity - form)</b>
<P>

1   	The plaintiff sues in respect of an article published in
<i>The Daily Telegraph </i>on 19 March 1999 (page 35).  The headline and text
of the publication complained of is appended hereto.
<P>

2   	Extraordinarily, from so short a piece, seven imputations
were pleaded originally and as arising from the natural and ordinary
meaning:
<P>

<i>"(a)	The plaintiff so misconducted himself he was being pursued by customs
over drugs warnings.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	The plaintiff so misconducted himself he has been warned by customs he
could be charged.</i>
<P>

<i><strike>(c)	The plaintiff so conducted himself he has been pursued by the
Customs Service</strike>.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	The plaintiff so misconducted himself that the Customs Service has
alleged he breached the Public Service Code of Conduct.</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	The plaintiff so misconducted himself that he resigned his position from
the senior staff of customs.</i>
<P>

<i>(f)	The plaintiff so misconducted himself that Customs Chief Executive
Lionel Woodward has ordered an internal inquiry be made about
him.</i>
<P>

<i>(g)	The plaintiff in breach of his duties as a customs officer exposed gaps
in Australia's borders which could lead to the importation
of drugs".</i>
<P>

3   	Imputation (c) was not pressed.
<P>

4   	It is to be noted that the headline refers to two customs
officers, that the first part of the article deals with the plaintiff
and after
the introduction of the second officer, Mr Bennett, there is a reference to
"<i>internal inquiries into both</i>" and the giving of "<i>written
warnings</i>".  The balance of the article appears, on its face, to deal then
with Mr Bennett only.
<P>

5   	It is argued for the defendant that the imputations are bad
in form, ambiguous and cannot, in any event, reasonably arise.
"<i>Misconducted</i>" is a dangerous, weasel word rendering imputation (a), in
particular, quite meaningless and has the same effect wherever it is used.
"<i>Misconducted"</i> is an assertion of guilt but its use in the imputations
"<i>flaws</i>" them especially (b), (d) and (f). These imputations could
otherwise be characterised as suspicion imputations (that is, subject
to
investigation, inquiry, warning).  
<P>

6   	For the plaintiff, as I understand it, it is insisted that
the use of "<i>misconduct</i>" in a general way is available because the matter
complained of itself is capable, by reason of its generality (the breaches are
not spelt out), of being understood by the ordinary reasonable reader as
implying there is more to it all than what is in fact said.
 It is further
submitted that the proliferation of imputations is sustainable because the
words attributed to Mr Bennett could be
understood by the reader to be
applicable to the plaintiff.
<P>

7   	This is a remarkably straightforward article, in my view.
It embraces both the persons referred to not only in its headline
but in the
separate part of it dealing with each.  What is clear is that the two persons
referred to have done two things;  first,
they "<i>exposed gaps in Australian
borders"</i> (as customs officials) and "<i>claimed Sydney's Olympics would be
awash with drugs".</i>  As a result of doing those things certain things have
happened.  Specifically, each has been warned that he could be charged.
Breaches
of the Public Service Code of Conduct are alleged in one case which
must be that of the plaintiff as the article deals with specifically
with an
actual charge (disclosing "<i>public business"</i>) laid against Mr Bennett.
<P>

8   	I reject the submission that the ordinary reasonable reader
would come to the view on reading both columns that there was more
behind this
affair notwithstanding the clear statement of what each official had done.  I
reject the submission that the words concluding
the piece attributed to Mr
Bennett would be understood as applying to the plaintiff.  The last three
paragraphs of the matter complained
of on any reasonable reading could only be
referrable to Mr Bennett.  He has gone public as indicated in the article, is
head of
the Customs Officers Association and in the first person relates what
he perceives to have happened to "<i>him"</i>.  
<P>

9   	In relation to the plaintiff it is to be noted that the
fourth paragraph of the article could be understood as amplifying the
exposure
of the gaps and the claim made by reference to Mr Fleming warning that "<i>lax
laws and border controls would see foreign athletes and coaches and their
performance boosting steroids (entering) Sydney virtually
unchallenged".</i>
<P>

10   	The <i>"misconduct</i>" has been identified.  There is no
need to use the word "<i>misconduct</i>" in any imputation.  Two imputations or
possibly three at most, properly drawn and carefully drawn could capture that
which constitutes
the plaintiff's grievance.
<P>

11   	I strike out imputations (a) to (f) as being bad in
form.
<P>

12   	As to imputation (g), this seems to me really to capture
what the plaintiff is complaining about.  It identifies what he did
and asserts
that he is in breach (an assertion of guilt) and in my view, is arguably
capable of arising.  The plaintiff might wish
to give consideration to pleading
a <i>"fallback</i>" imputation of suspicion.  
<P>

13   	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	Imputations (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) are struck out.
<P>

2.	Imputation (g) is capable of arising and will go to the jury.
<P>

3.	The plaintiff has leave to file an Amended Statement of Claim within 14
days.
<P>

4.	The plaintiff is to pay the defendant's costs of the application heard on 27
August 1999.
<P>

5.	The matter is stood over to the Defamation List on 19 November 1999.

Headline:	<b><i>Customs pursues two senior staff over drugs warnings</i></b>
<P>

By-line:	<b><i>Charles Miranda</i></b>
<P>

Two customs officials who exposed gaps in Australia's borders and claimed
Sydney's Olympics would be awash with drugs have been
warned they could be
charged.
<P>

The Customs Service has been pursuing two of its most senior staff since late
last year, in one case alleging breaches of the Public
Service Code of
Conduct.
<P>

One of the officers and leading authority on steroids Craig Fleming has
recently resigned to take up a position with the Australian
Olympic Committee
and anti-doping branch.
<P>

It is understood Customs planned to charged Mr Fleming after he warned lax law
and border controls would see foreign athletes and
coaches and their
performance-boosting steroids enter Sydney virtually unchallenged.
<P>

He was a 15-year Customs veteran and Churchill Fellowship recipient.
<P>

The second officer, Peter Bennett, has been charged with disclosing "<i>public
business</i>" with official Customs knowledge.
<P>

Customs chief executive Lionel Woodward ordered the internal inquiries into
both and gave written warnings.
<P>

Mr Bennett, as head of the Customs Officers Association, spoke on a number of
talkback radio programs on Customs matter including
on an article by <i>The
Daily Telegraph</i> which revealed the service planned to replace its sea port
patrols with spy cameras and a fax machine.
<P>

Mr Bennett, a 27 year Customs veteran, yesterday confirmed he had been told he
was to be charged but would not comment further.
<P>

`<i>I have been intimidated and coerced from making public comment on any
matter;  I fear reprisals and the move is intended to stop public
debate on
matters arising from my responsibilities in Customs</i>," he said.
<P>
