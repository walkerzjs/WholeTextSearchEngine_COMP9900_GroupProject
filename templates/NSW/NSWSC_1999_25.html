DECISION: 
<P>

Costs reserved
<P>

JUDGMENT: 
<P>

1	I gave judgment in this matter on 29 January 1999.  Prior to the matter
coming into my hands an order had been made for the hearing
of a separate
issue.  Although I am not sure that the usual expressions fit this case, I will
speak in terms of a separate trial
as to liability and a deferment of
quantification of damages.  I dealt only with liability. 
<P>

2	On 4 February 1999, I heard argument as to the costs of the separate trial as
to liability.  On behalf of the plaintiff, application
was made for an order
for the costs of the separate trial and for a further order that such costs be
assessed and payable forthwith.
 Without the latter order, payment would be
deferred under the rules and could be set off against any order for costs that
might
subsequently be made in favour of the defendants.
<P>

3	In support of such orders, it was submitted that, although the plaintiffs had
acceded to a separate trial as to liability, it
was the defendants who had
proposed that course.  The plaintiffs, it was submitted, had succeeded on a
discrete issue.  There was
no reasonable prospect, it was submitted, that the
plaintiffs would fail to recover damages and, accordingly, no reasonable
prospect
that the defendants would recover any order for costs which might in
fairness have to be set off against an order for costs in favour
of the
plaintiffs.  It was at least likely, it was submitted, that the plaintiffs
would recover an award of damages.  
<P>

4	On behalf of the defendants, it was submitted that the costs of the separate
trial as to liability should be reserved because
the outcome of the case as a
whole was unknown.  As a secondary position, it was submitted that any order
for costs in favour of
the plaintiffs should be reduced because a significant
part of the trial and preparation for trial was spent on an analysis of the
plaintiffs' evidence which resulted in two of the plaintiffs' three witnesses
not being accepted by the court, and because a substantial
number of the
specific findings sought by the plaintiffs as to breach of duty and the factual
consequences were rejected.
<P>

5	On behalf of the defendants, in answer to the argument that any order for
costs in favour of the plaintiffs should be reduced,
it was submitted that the
plaintiffs had substantially succeeded because, in substance, the court had
held in their favour that as
a result of breach of contractual duty on the part
of the defendants they had lost the chance of a successful prosecution of the
Federal Court proceedings, and had signed away intellectual property rights by
executing the settlement deed.
<P>

6	Were this a final hearing, I would make an order for payment by the
defendants of the plaintiffs' costs without reduction.  I
accept the submission
that the plaintiffs have substantially succeeded in the separate trial as to
liability.  Many of the findings
sought which I declined to make were of minor
importance and occupied little trial time.  It is true that a substantial part
of the
trial time and, I accept, preparation time was occupied in an attack on
the credibility of the plaintiffs' three witnesses which
resulted in the court
not accepting two of them.  However, the objective of the attack was to
persuade the court to reject them all
which did not occur.  In the result, the
one witness accepted by the court carried the day for the plaintiffs.  So the
attack failed
in its objective.  In these circumstances, I see no appropriate
reason for reducing an order for costs on this basis.
<P>

7	As I have said, that is the approach I would take if I were to order the
defendants to pay the plaintiffs' costs of the separate
trial as to liability.
However, I do not intend to do that.  The costs of the separate trial as to
liability should be reserved for
determination by the judge who hears the next
segment of the case.  I say that because the issue as to liability in this case
is
no more discrete than it would have been if the whole of the case had been
heard together at the one time.  I do not think that there
should be a
different approach because the parties have, in their mutual interests, agreed
to a separate trial as to liability. 
Secondly, I cannot say that the
plaintiffs will necessarily succeed in the next segment of the proceedings.
That should not be read
as implying any view on my part, however provisional.
There is simply not the material available for me to form a view about that
one
way or the other.  In these circumstances, it could prove to be unfair to the
defendants to require them to pay costs at this
stage which might theoretically
be offset by an order for costs in their favour at a later time.  It is also
possible that further
developments in the proceedings might bear upon the
proper approach to the costs of the separate trial as to liability.  For
example,
if the plaintiffs failed to establish an entitlement to compensatory
damages altogether, consideration would have to be given to
whether the
plaintiffs should be ordered to pay the defendants' costs of the whole of the
proceedings.
<P>

8	For these reasons, I reserve the costs of the separate trial as to
liability.
