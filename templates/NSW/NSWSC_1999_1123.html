<b>3854/95	JAMES R. SMITH &amp; ANOR v UGLA P/L &amp; 5 ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiff Dr Smith is a medical practitioner and
he has been a director of the Eastern Suburbs Private Hospital
since 1980 or
earlier, and practiced professionally there.  In 1980 the plaintiff Dr Smith
and the fourth defendant Dr Tom Wenkart
were directors of the Hospital.  Dr
Smith is still employed there and is a member of its superannuation fund,
although having regard
to his age and state of health he may well retire in the
near future.  In these proceedings he made a number of claims relating to
the
conduct of the superannuation fund and his interest in it, but all areas of
dispute but one have been resolved, some by orders
of the Court and some by an
arrangement which I was told by counsel at the hearing would result in consent
orders, although I have
not yet been shown the form of orders. I was told that
the effect of these arrangements and concessions is that it is conceded that
certain of the defendants (and I am yet to learn which) are liable to pay
$300,000 to Dr Smith as his retirement benefit under the
Superannuation Fund
when he should retire; or are liable to put UGLA in funds to make that payment
to him.  
<P>

2  	The matter debated at the hearing on 8 and 9 November relates to
Dr Smith's claim to be the beneficial owner of several life
insurance policies
on his own life; there have been five but two have lapsed.  The Superannuation
Fund was established in 1980 and
its members were the directors of the
Hospital, Dr Smith and Dr Tom Wenkart&#184; and a number of employees.  A large
change in superannuation
affairs followed the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/ossa1987404/" class="autolink_findacts">Occupational Superannuation
Standards Act 1987</a> and Regulations thereunder.  An industry-wide superannuation
fund for private hospitals called the HESTA Fund was established about
1987 and
the  existing and new employees, but not (so far as appears) the directors
became members of the HESTA Fund.  As of 30 June
1989 Dr Wenkart ceased to be a
member of the Superannuation Fund, in some manner which does not clearly
appear, and at various times
employees who were members before the
establishment of the HESTA Fund have retired and their memberships have ended.
In August 1997
three long-serving employees and Dr Smith remained; and
apparently they are still members.  Employer contributions ceased or became
nominal after the establishment of the HESTA Fund.
<P>

3  	The first defendant UGLA Pty Ltd is the trustee of the
Superannuation Fund.  It has no other activity or business (but Dr Smith
alleges it is also and separately trustee of several life policies).  The two
shareholders in UGLA are the second plaintiff Shirim
Pty Ltd and the sixth
defendant Traknew Holdings Pty Ltd.  Shirim is controlled by Dr Smith and owns
24 shares and Traknew is controlled
by Dr Wenkart and owns 76 shares of the 100
issued shares in UGLA.  The interest of these shareholders in the issue before
me can
be no more than nominal.
<P>

4  	Dr Smith and Dr Wenkart are the directors of UGLA; they were its
only directors in June 1980 when the events opened and they
have remained its
only directors until the present time.
<P>

5  	The second defendant Fesena Pty Ltd owns and throughout the
events has owned land including the land on which the Eastern Suburbs
Private
Hospital premises stand.  The third defendant Eastern Suburbs Private Hospital
Pty Ltd which was formerly named GAB No. 94
Pty Ltd carries on the private
hospital and has been the employer to which the Superannuation Fund relates
throughout.  In 1980 Dr
Smith and Dr Wenkart were directors.  Dr Wenkart has a
controlling majority interest in Fesena and Eastern Suburbs Private Hospital
and Dr Smith has a minority interest in both.
<P>

6  	Dr Wenkart is the fourth defendant.  I was informed by counsel
that he became a bankrupt on Friday 5 November 1999.  However
no evidence dealt
with this.
<P>

7  	Ultera Pty Ltd the fifth defendant is the trustee of Morlea
Professional Services Superannuation Fund, a fund for employees
of companies
associated with Dr Wenkart, in which Dr Smith has no shareholding or other
involvement.
<P>

8  	The GAB No. 94 Superannuation Fund was established by a Trust
Deed dated 27 June 1980 the parties to which were Eastern Suburbs
Private
Hospital by its then name and UGLA.
<P>

9  	UGLA did not appear in the proceedings.  It appears that it is
not able to take any position in the proceedings because of the
state of
relations between Dr Smith and Dr Wenkart in which, as they are its only
directors, it is not possible for the company to
give instructions or come to
any decision.  It must be attributed to UGLA that it is fully aware of the
litigation, although it has
not filed an appearance.  The second to sixth
defendants had common representation in the proceedings and at the hearing.
<P>

10  	The Schedule to the Trust Deed sets out the rules of the fund
including <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/ossa1987404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 5</a> dealing with benefits.  I set out parts of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/ossa1987404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">rule 5:</a>
<P>

<i>"5.	Benefits</i>
<P>

<i>5.1	The benefit of a member in the Fund (herein called `the member's
benefit') at any time shall be the sum of:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	The amount standing to the credit of the member's Contribution Account
and the employer's Contribution Account for such member
compiled in accordance
with these Rules, and in computing the amount of a member's benefit at any
time, interest shall be added from
the date of the last preceding valuation to
the date of the happening of the event upon which the member's benefit becomes
payable
and such interest shall be calculated at that such rate as the Trustee
shall from time to time in its discretion determine; and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	The amount (if any) payable on the happening of the insured event under
any policy of assurance or endowment or disability and/or
sickness effected by
the Trustee in respect of such member pursuant to the Deed and the
Rules.</i>
<P>

<i>5.2	The amount of any member's benefit shall become payable on the first to
occur of the following dates, namely:-</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the date upon which such member reaches his normal retirement date and
ceases to be employed by the employer;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	upon the date of the happening of one of the events referred to in
sub.Rule 5.4 or sub-Rule 5.5 hereof."</i>
<P>

11  	Subrules 5.4 and 5.5 deal with contingencies other than
retirement in which a benefit for the amount standing to the members'
credit
may be paid out.  These events include (5.4(c)) - death of a member before
reaching his normal retirement date.  Definitions
in the Trust Deed establish
the normal retirement date as the 65th birthday, which Dr Smith has passed.  Dr
Smith's case at the present
time is dealt with by cl.5.3 in these terms:
<P>

<i>"5.3	In the event of any member remaining in the employment of the Employer
after reaching his normal retirement date he shall at
his option be entitled to
remain a member of the Scheme and continue to be entitled to benefits
thereunder until he ceases to be
employed by the employer, at which date the
member's benefit shall become payable."</i>
<P>

12  	The amount of death benefit payable can under provisions in r.5
be affected by discretionary decisions of the trustee; whereas
on retirement Dr
Smith will be entitled under subr.5.3 to the whole benefit prescribed by
subr.5.1.
<P>

13  	Late in 1980 three life insurance policies on Dr Smith's life
were taken out by Ultera, and on the face of the documents they
were taken out
for the Morlea Professional Services Superannuation Fund, of which Dr Smith was
not in fact a member.  The court's
order of 8 December 1998, which was made by
consent, ordered that the three policies which remain current be transferred by
Ultera
to UGLA "who will hold the same as trustee of the GAB No. 94
Superannuation Fund or upon such other trust as the court may otherwise
declare."  The order was based not only on the parties' consent but also on an
admission in pleadings by Ultera.  
<P>

14  	The three policies referred to in the Order are described in
para 10 of the Amended Statement of Claim at subpars 10(a), 10(b)
and 10(c):
<P>

<i>10(a)	ANZ Life Insurance Company Ltd (then named Greater Pacific Life
Insurances Company Ltd)</i>
<P>

<i>Policy No. 10019297R</i>
<P>

<i>Date commenced 1.11.80</i>
<P>

<i>Amount insured $150,000</i>
<P>

<i>10(c)	Colonial Financial Management Ltd (then named Scottish Amicable Life
Assurance Society).</i>
<P>

<i>Policy No. 87920</i>
<P>

<i>Amount Insured $100,000</i>
<P>

<i>Date commenced 16.12.80</i>
<P>

15  	The ANZ Life Insurance Policy is still current.  The Colonial
Financial Management Policy still exists but premiums on it are
unpaid so that
it has a present value of approximately $4,000.
<P>

16  	At about the same time Policy 10(d) issued as follows:
<P>

<i>Oceanic Life Limited (then named APA Life Assurance Ltd)</i>
<P>

<i>Policy No. 5883012</i>
<P>

<i>Date commenced 15.11.80</i>
<P>

<i>Amount insured $100,000.</i>
<P>

At some time this policy has lapsed because premiums have not been paid.
<P>

17  	In 1984 Ultera obtained two further policies:
<P>

<i>10(b) Sun Alliance Life Assurance Ltd.</i>
<P>

<i>Policy No. 0484KZ01</i>
<P>

<i>Amount insured $100,000</i>
<P>

<i>Date commenced 1.4.84</i>
<P>

<i>10(e) Lumley Life Ltd (then named Security Life Assurances Ltd)</i>
<P>

<i>Policy No. 112091</i>
<P>

<i>Amount Insured $100,000</i>
<P>

<i>Date commenced 1.4.84.</i>
<P>

18  	The Sun Alliance Life Assurance is still current but the Lumley
policy has lapsed, apparently for non-payment of premiums.
The circumstances
which brought the Sun Alliance policy into existence in April 1984 are not
explained and have no apparent relationship
with the arrangements made in June
1980.  
<P>

19  	On the probabilities, the source of all moneys paid as premiums
has been that GAB No. 94 has put UGLA in funds to pay them.
 
<P>

20  	Dr Smith's case is to the effect that arrangements made orally
between Dr Wenkart and himself about the time in June 1980 when
the Trust Deed
was executed, but before it was executed, establish that the trustee of the
superannuation fund which was to be created
was to obtain policies on the lives
of the two directors, and that those policies would be held by the trustee on
trust for the respective
directors whose lives were insured, not as assets of
the fund and not subject to the trusts of the fund.
<P>

21  	The conversation occurred in a factual context in which
formation of the Superannuation Fund was under consideration, and was
being
recommended and managed by Mr Reg Austin who was the principal of a business of
setting up superannuation funds.  Mr Austin
pointed out in his general letter
of advice of 2 June 1980 that the formation of the Superannuation Fund and the
need to obtain life
insurance cover which was necessary to put the fund in a
position to pay benefits before the completion of an ordinary working lifetime
created an opportunity to obtain life insurance over the lives of directors
with a "free cover" limit in the vicinity of $300,000.
 "Free cover" meant that
life insurance was obtainable without submitting the life insured to medical
examination.  When discussing
death cover Mr Austin said: 
<P>

<i>"We can offer the easiest and most convenient method of providing Death
Cover for all employers (including yourselves).  By the signing
of a
certificate stating all employees are actively working, all employees will be
covered for a maximum of $10,000 </i><cite>WITHOUT ANY HEALTH
EVIDENCE</cite><i> of any kind.</i>
<P>

<i>This could be increased to $15,000 for Directors.</i>
<P>

<i>If we were to include the other business of Dr. [Wenkart], purely for
</i><cite>MEDICAL FREE</cite><i> Death Benefit, the </i><cite>FREE COVER
LIMIT</cite><i> would be in the vicinity of $300,000.</i>
<P>

<i>This cover, once effected, can be transferred out of the Superannuation
Funds to individual policies, if so desired.</i>
<P>

<i>There would be no loss of benefit if this was done."</i>
<P>

22  	What seems to underlie this is that life insurers were prepared
to accept the fact that an employee was in active employment
as a sufficient
indication of facts material to the quality of the life assured if the insurers
were to get a block of business associated
with a superannuation fund covering
a number of lives, and would not require medical examination.  The advantages
would be at their
greatest if a large block of superannuation business
associated with Dr Wenkart's affairs were brought in, and as a speculation I
suppose that this may have some connection with the circumstances in which
policies were issued to Ultera and not to UGLA.
<P>

23  	It will be seen that Mr Austin's advice referred to the transfer
of the specially high cover which could be effected on directors'
lives as a
later stage, a transfer out of the superannuation funds to individual policies,
after the cover had been effected, if
so desired.  The contemplation was that
when first effected the cover on the directors' lives would be within the
superannuation
fund.
<P>

24  	Dr Smith's evidence dealing with the relevant events was not
challenged by any evidence of Dr Wenkart.  His evidence appears
in paras 8 to
13 of Dr Smith's affidavit of 6 October 1995 which I set out:
<P>

<i>"8.	On or about 5 March 1980 I had a meeting with Dr Wenkart at Netherleigh
Private Hospital in Randwick and I said to him words to
the following
effect:</i>
<P>

<i>`I think we should consider starting a Superannuation Fund both of us have
medical problems and we should give some consideration
to it for this financial
year.'</i>
<P>

<i>Dr Wenkart said to me words to the following effect:</i>
<P>

<i>`Yes, I think that's a good idea.  I'd like to put a Superannuation Fund in
place.'</i>
<P>

<i>I then said to him words to the following effect:</i>
<P>

<i>`I have a friend, Reg Austin who is in the business of setting up
Superannuation Funds.  I'll get him to put a proposal to us.'</i>
<P>

<i>Dr Wenkart said to me words to the following effect:</i>
<P>

<i>`Yes, go ahead and do that.  He can contact me directly.'</i>
<P>

<i>9.	I subsequently had a conversation with Reg Austin and he informed me that
he would prepare a letter of recommendation.  At pages
336 to 340 in the
exhibit is a copy of a letter from Reg Austin Superannuation adderessed to me
and dated 2 June 1980.</i>
<P>

<i>10.	On or about 6 June 1980 I had a conversation with Mr Austin and he said
to me words to the following effect:</i>
<P>

<i>`I have spoken to Tom Wenkart.  He is happy with the recommendations.  I
should be able to arrange whole-of-life insurance policies
without the need for
medical examinations for both of you.  Are you prepared to go ahead with
it?'</i>
<P>

<i>I then said to him words to the following effect:</i>
<P>

<i>`Yes, I'm happy with all that recommendation.  I am most interested in
getting the whole-of-life insurance policy put in place.'</i>
<P>

<i>11.	Towards the latter part of June 1980 I spoke to Reg Austin and he said
to me words to the following effect:</i>
<P>

<i>`In regard to the whole-of-life insurance for you and Tom, I can get you
each $300,000 cover.'</i>
<P>

<i>12.	On or about 27 June 1980 the fund was established.  At that time I
recollect having a conversation with Dr Wenkart where I said
to him words to
the following effect:</i>
<P>

<i>`Has Reg Austin spoken to you about the whole-of-life insurance for $300,000
for you and me?  It would be very good as we don't have
to do a
medical.'</i>
<P>

<i>Dr Wenkart then said to me words to the following effect:</i>
<P>

<i>`Yes, Reg Austin is organizing the insurances.  He is going to put
Superannuation Funds in place for all my businesses.  This means
that we will
effectively get whole-of-life insurance for $300,000 each without medicals.  I
am very pleased about that as you and
I would have difficulty in passing a
medical considering our heart problems.  This insurance is a bonus for us as
directors.  This
is on top of our other benefits in the Super Plan.'</i>
<P>

<i>13	Some time after the fund was established Reg Austin sent me copies of the
insurance policies covering my life.  In the exhibit
at pages 142 to 146 are
copies of Certificates of Insurance (hereinafter called `the whole-of-life
insurance').  To the best of my
knowledge and belief the fourth defendant also
received Certificates of Insurance on his life."</i>
<P>

25  	The documents which Dr Smith produced as the copies of insurance
policies are certificates of insurance relating to policy
10(a) the Greater
Pacific Life Insurance Company Policy, 10(c) the Scottish Amicable Policy and
10(d) the APA Life Assurance Policy
(which has lapsed).  The Scottish Amicable
certificate states distinctly that the Superannuation Trustees (referring to
Morlea Professional
Services Pty Ltd and by inference to Ultera) are the
proposer to whom insurance moneys are payable and the APA certificate clearly
relates the insurance to the GAB No. 94 Staff Superannuation Fund.  The Greater
Pacific Life certificate is less distinct in its
indications but shows the
policy owner as GAB No. 94.
<P>

26  	In seeking to understand what was said in the conversation with
Dr Wenkart given in Dr Smith's evidence, the context set by
Mr Austin's letter
of advice is the predominating element.  The later behaviour of the parties can
also be looked to, in so far as
it gives any indication of their intention, for
the purposes of making findings about the meaning of what was said in the
conversation
or of any arrangement or agreement which was then made.
<P>

27  	A trust of personal property such as a life insurance policy may
be created by a declaration of trust by the beneficial owner
of the property in
terms which establish an intention then and there to create a trust.  A trust
should be treated as having come
into existence where there was an agreement
for consideration to create a trust, and the circumstances in which it was to
be created
later happened; in that case it should be accepted that a trust came
into existence even if no evidence of an express declaration
of trust were
available, or even if it were established that there had not been one.  The
creation of a trust may be established
by circumstantial evidence even though
no direct evidence of a declaration of trust may be available and no particular
event which
brought the trust into existence can be identified.  In the affairs
of companies entries in business records can from time to time
be found to show
that a trust exists even though no event in which it was created can be
identified; and similar results can be attributed
to estoppels arising from
company records when they have been acted on.  Where there is no evidence of an
express declaration of
trust an arrangement which was not made for value will
not be enforced as there is no equity to perfect an imperfectly constituted
voluntary trust.
<P>

28  	Several things should be observed about seeking to come to an
understanding of the meaning and effect of the conversation or
arrangements
between Dr Smith and Dr Wenkart.  At the time of the conversation no life
policies existed; they did not come to existence
until some months later.  Nor
did Ultera have any interest in any life policies.  When it became a trustee
UGLA would as a practical
business matter need to obtain insurance on the lives
of members of the superannuation fund which was about to be established, but
no
steps had been taken to do that; there was no superannuation trust or
superannuation fund and there were no members.  Protecting
the financial
position of the Superannuation Fund when formed and its ability to pay benefits
would require UGLA to have term insurance
on the lives of members. Term
insurance is considerably cheaper than whole-of-life insurance; naturally
enough, as no value is built
up over time while term insurance is maintained.
Whole-of-life insurance would cost more and provide more than the
superannuation
fund itself would need in terms of benefits available; as the
years pass and premiums are paid, asset value accumulates, and continues
to be
available even after a member has retired and the fund is no longer exposed to
the contingency of liability for death benefit.
<P>

29  	I do not see the oral arrangement between Dr Smith and Dr
Wenkart as an agreement for value to which UGLA was a party.  There
is no
element in the arrangement referred to in which UGLA obtained consideration for
declaring or agreeing to declare a trust of
life policies which were to be
effected.  
<P>

30  	At the time of the conversation Dr Wenkart and Dr Smith were not
trustees, UGLA was not a trustee and there was no trust. 
They spoke in
contemplation of the creation of the superannuation trust in the near future,
and no trust existed until that was done.
 An arrangement between the
controlling minds of the trustee company, made before the trust was brought
into existence, about what
some discretionary decision of the trustee company
would be is in my opinion incapable of bringing any rights into existence; the
manner in which discretionary powers of the future trustee will be exercised
and the discretionary decision which it will make, whether
with respect to
making an arrangement to convert insurance policies into individual policies
for the benefit of members, or with
respect to any other matter, cannot be
effectually decided or pre-committed in advance in a binding way.
<P>

31  	On the terms of the conversation given in evidence I am unable
to see the arrangement as an arrangement to which UGLA was a
party at all.  In
my understanding Dr Wenkart spoke of an arrangement which could prospectively
be made by Dr Wenkart and Dr Smith
or by the trustee of the Superannuation Fund
under their control in the future when the Superannuation Fund was established.
Dr Smith
and Dr Wenkart were already directors of UGLA, but they did not speak
in terms which suggest that they intended to made a decision
on behalf of UGLA,
and they did not express what they said in terms appropriate to a resolution of
UGLA's directors, or record any
decision in a manner appropriate for a decision
of UGLA's directors.
<P>

32  	The context set by Mr Austin's letter suggests that what was
under consideration was whether the Superannuation Fund and its
trustee should
take out insurance for large sums free of medical examination, with the
prospect that those insurances could later
be transferred out of the fund into
individual policies.  The result contemplated could only be brought about by a
series of steps
which had yet to be taken, and there was nothing concrete about
the steps unless and until they were taken.  As a first step, policies
had to
be obtained.  Then as later steps the course which Mr Austin indicated would be
available and individual policies could be
obtained instead of the policies of
the Superannuation Fund; but nothing would be effected unless and until those
steps were taken.
<P>

33  	I see nothing in the evidence of the conversation or of the
surrounding circumstances which supports a finding that Dr Smith
and Dr Wenkart
decided to set up, in effect, another trust or trusts of which UGLA would be
trustee in addition to the Superannuation
Trust, being trusts for them
individually of life policies which were to be obtained.  The circumstances
strongly suggest that this
was not in contemplation; these circumstances are
that they were proceeding to cause UGLA to enter into the Trust Deed, which it
did soon after, and were doing so on the basis that its resources would be
contributions to the Superannuation Fund paid by GAB No.
94 for the purpose of
paying benefits to its directors and employees; there is no indication of any
kind that there was to be any
other source than money contributed to the
Superannuation Fund under the Trust Deed for payment of premiums on the lives
of individual
directors.  I do not think that the conversation given in
evidence, notwithstanding the reference to the insurance being a bonus
to the
directors and being on top of other benefits, establishes that there was any
intention to create beneficial interests in prospective
policies other than
interests in benefits in accordance with the Trust Deed.  
<P>

34  	It would indeed be a bonus for directors if the fund of which
they were members had the benefit of large insurances on their
lives, and if
the possibility existed of those large insurances being converted into
individual policies, as Mr Austin indicated
was a possible course.  There is
quite enough advantage for the directors in creating the opportunity for future
conduct of those
kinds to explain the language used.  The language used does
not on a fair view evince a binding commitment to carry out the several
steps
which it would be necessary to perform in order actually to confer individual
policies on directors, and does not, in my finding,
evince an intention then
and there by a few spoken words to cover the whole ground which it would
require several decisions and several
courses of conduct executing them to
cover.  Even if that intention had then and there existed and had been
expressed in the conversation,
I am of the view that the conversation would not
be effective to constitute a trust.
<P>

35  	Evidence of events and dealings of UGLA including the terms of
directors' minutes, accounts and financial statements and returns
to
superannuation industry regulatory authorities was examined minutely, and it
was contended that material in these sources supports
the case of one party or
the other.  In my view not much confidence can be put in indications from these
sources because it is clear
that the affairs of UGLA were not handled in a
regular or consistent way; its records are not reliable indications of its
rights.
 Dr Smith's evidence shows that for, over 10 years he did not attend
any meetings of directors or of members of the company; he says
that he did not
sign the Trust Deed of 27 June 1980 or make any formal decision to enter into
it, although he did not attempt to
disavow it.  He says that he did not see the
deed or a copy for about twelve years.  Whatever persons and events produced
the series
of annual financial statements, which at least on their face appear
to have been adopted by directors, have not been proved.  
<P>

36  	For a first phase which lasted some years, the financial
statements of the Superannuation Fund did not refer to the whole-of-life
policies on Dr Smith's life, or to any corresponding policies on Dr Wenkart's
life.  This is not a sound basis for any inference
that the company regarded
the whole-of-life policies as not being assets of the superannuation fund; it
is at least equally possible
that whoever prepared the accounts did not include
them in the company's assets (and there is no comprehensive list of the
company's
assets) because that person was unaware of the circumstances in which
Ultera was holding the policies; or was unaware that they were
not term
insurance policies; or it may be that in their early stages the policies had no
surrender value or their surrender value
was so small that they were not
regarded as appropriate to be accounted for; or there may have been simple
carelessness.  There is
no general scheme of regularity which would make
inferences from the financial statements reliable; in any event there is no
clear
inference.  From 1988 onwards the policies are or appear to be reflected
in the balance sheets as assets of the Superannuation Trust.
<P>

37  	In the early years the financial statements show receipts in and
payments out of (generally) corresponding sums for premiums
on policies; but
the policies referred to are not identified, and this pattern in the accounts
while consistent with a pattern of
events in which GAB No. 94 paid UGLA amounts
of money specifically to be paid for insurance policies does not confirm that
that happened;
and if it did confirm that that happened the pattern would not
show that the policies were held on any trust separate to the trusts
of the
Superannuation Fund.  
<P>

38  	The financial statements for later years become more markedly
irregular.  Large sums are accounted for as having been paid
to GAB No. 94 on
forfeiture of the interests of members, but there are no records showing such
forfeitures, or directors' decisions
relating to forfeitures, and no reason on
the face of the Trust Deed and its amendments why such events would produce an
entitlement
of GAB No. 94 to any payment.  During this phase there were marked
inconsistencies in statements in the accounts and elsewhere about
the
entitlements of Dr Smith and Dr Wenkart.  The accounts reflect a supposed
withdrawal by Dr Wenkart from the fund as of 30 June
1989, although there are
no records of decisions which reflect that event.  First the death benefit was
to be $100,000; the policies
obtained greatly exceeded this.  At a later stage
the amount of death benefit was treated as having in some way been increased to
$300,000, and as Dr Wenkart was treated as having withdrawn from the fund, can
have applied only to Dr Smith.
<P>

39  	From about 1990 onwards, when there were few members left apart
from Dr Smith, records of UGLA begin to reflect his increasing
concern; but the
financial statements did not acknowledge clearly, or to my reading at all, any
interest such as is alleged.  If
the theory of the financial statements was
that they accounted for the affairs of the Superannuation Trust as an entity
different
to the affairs of UGLA as a whole it may be that the whole-of-life
policies, according to the plaintiff's case, would not have any
part in them;
but if that were so, one would expect to find them accounted for elsewhere.
<P>

40  	Returns to regulatory authorities, after a period when they did
not show any life policies as assets of the Superannuation
Fund, eventually
came to show the value of life policies as relatively small proportions of
those assets; without identifying the
policies.  Dr Smith signed some of these
documents, but on the evidence it must be said that he did so irresponsibly,
signing what
was put before him without checking or understanding their
contents or implications.  The fact that at some times such returns appear
to
include some unidentified life policies among assets of the superannuation fund
is no real indication about the beneficial entitlement
to any particular
identified policy.
<P>

41  	The first statement in accounts or returns to regulatory
authorities which could possibly reflect the view that a life policy
was an
asset of the Superannuation Fund (and it is very unlikely that a term policy
would be such an asset) is in the return to the
Superannuation Commission for
1988; unlike the previous returns it shows insurance policies as assets of the
funds and attributes
8% of the assets of the fund to them.  The financial
statements for the year 1989 appear to treat life policies as assets of the
fund; however there are marked irregularities in the financial statements for
1989.  Thereafter financial statements could possibly
reflect the view that the
life policies were assets of the Superannuation Fund; although this is not
altogether clear.
<P>

42  	When calculations were made from time to time by actuaries or
other experts relating to the sufficiency of the assets of the
Superannuation
Trust to meets its obligations the policies were not brought into account as
assets.  However these circumstances
do not appear to me to be of any weight
because the evidence does not explain the basis on which instructions were
given to the actuaries
or other experts; they were certainly not given by the
directors of UGLA, and at times the instructions given, when they can be seen,
were plainly incorrect.
<P>

43  	After Dr Smith began to exhibit interest and concern in what he
thought of as his entitlement to some interest related to the
whole-of-life
insurance policies on his life, a meeting of directors, which in fact occurred
and was recorded in a minute (which
does not bear any date), took place late in
1991 and resolved as follows:
<P>

<i>DEATH BENEFIT:  It was resolved that under the powers given to them by the
Deed and Rules of the Gab No. 94 Superannuation Fund trhat
in the event of the
death of Dr. J.R. Smith whilst a member of the Gab No. 94 Superannuation Fund a
benefit equal to the proceeds
of the insurance policies from the Sun Alliance,
ANZ Life and Victory Insurance Co. be paid to his estate.</i>
<P>

<i>RETIREMENT BENEFIT:  It was resolved by the Trustee that under the powers
given to them by the Deed and Rules of the Gab No. 94 Superannuation
Fund to
fix the retirement benefit in terms of the Deed and Rules for Dr. J.R. Smith at
the sum of three hundred thousand dollars
($300,000).</i>
<P>

44  	This minute is the high point of written confirmation of the
plaintiff's case; in my opinion however it does not, on proper
consideration of
what it says, actually confirm the plaintiff's case.  The first paragraph
appears to have established an entitlement
of Dr Smith and his estate to a
death benefit measured by reference to the amount of the policy, but its terms
also strongly imply
that he did not have any other entitlement to the proceeds
of the policy.  Dr Smith was a party to the resolution.  I read this resolution
as confirming and acknowledging that he did not have beneficial ownership of
the policies referred to, and did not have an interest
in them independently of
any decision by UGLA or of any entitlement under the Superannuation Deed. The
terms of the resolution impliedly
but clearly contradict a conclusion that Dr
Smith was regarded as the beneficial owner of the policy.  As he is now past
the age
of 65 years I would not think that this decision could have any
continuing effect, bearing in mind subr.5.3.  In the event of his
death before
retirement I would think that the function of the policies would be to assist
the Superannuation Fund to be in funds
to meet the retirement benefit to which
his estate would then be entitled, on the footing that, in terms of subr.5.3,
he ceased to
be employed at his death.
<P>

45  	I see no reason to regard this resolution as a decision that Dr
Smith would be entitled to both retirement benefit and death
benefit
cumulatively.  That would be a marked departure from the operation of the rules
in the schedule and from the ordinary workings
of superannuation schemes.
Cross-examination established that at the time of the resolution Dr Smith
believed that the life policies
were an asset of the superannuation fund - see
transcript p8, l.57 to p9, l.1 and p.9, l.56 to p10, l.1.  However Dr Smith's
interpretation
of the law and the facts is not determinative of his rights.
<P>

46  	The body of evidence relating to events in the history of UGLA
and the superannuation fund after 1980 is, in my opinion, of
no real
significance in coming to a conclusion of fact on the meaning and effect of
what was said in the conversation of June 1980.
 Dr Smith's participation in
these events and his acknowledgments, even if they appear to be contrary to his
case have no great significance
because the documents do not paint any clear
picture, and the conclusion which the court should draw on the meaning and
effect of
the conversation of June 1980 should be based on an appraisal of the
terms of that conversation rather than on Dr Smith's interpretation
or on
uncertain indications in his behaviour many years later.
<P>

47  	It is to my mind altogether too much and quite wrong to suppose
that the reference to the policies as a bonus for the directors
had the meaning
that directors were to be the beneficial owners of the policies to the
exclusion of the fund created by the Superannuation
Deed.  The reference to a
bonus is indeterminate, and its ordinary and natural meaning is fulfilled if
the policies were to be brought
into existence and were to be available to be
converted into individual policies by the exercise described by Mr Austin, in
the contemplation
that that exercise would at some time be carried out; but it
never was.
<P>

48  	If Dr Wenkart's statement had truly meant, as it appears to
mean, that the premiums were to be paid out of the superannuation
fund, it
would be improper to arrange that that should be done although the
superannuation fund was not to own the policies.  If
it was truly intended and
arranged that those things should happen is not surprising that the arrangement
should not ever have been
carried out, or that the arrangement should not ever
have been recorded after the fund was established.
<P>

49  	I hold that that conversation did not express an intention on
behalf of  Dr Smith and Dr Wenkart to create a trust in favour
of their
respective selves and separate from the superannuation fund of any policies on
their lives which might be obtained by the
means which Mr Austin had indicated.
I also hold that the conversation did not constitute any agreement for value
which was or could
be binding on UGLA.  I hold that the conversation did not
constitute any decision of UGLA through its directors at all, and did no
more
than indicate that they were both contemplating carrying out some such course
as Mr Austin had indicated could be carried out,
and that they were
contemplating deriving advantages from it.  This contemplation has had no
effect, because it remained in contemplation,
and none of the various steps
which would have constituted realising it was ever taken.
<P>

50  	Overall the conclusion which should be reached with respect of
beneficial ownership of the policies is that they, as assets
acquired by a
company which had no other business or affairs than to act as trustee of a
superannuation fund in accordance with a
trust deed, should be understood to be
assets of the superannuation trust. This conclusion should be realised, on the
general probabilities
of UGLA's situation, for assets acquired through its own
activity and also for assets conferred on it by some other person in
circumstances
which are not explained,.
<P>

51  	The inference that some property right conferred on UGLA was
conferred as an addition to the assets of the superannuation fund
is no
different whether the property right conferred was legal ownership of a
whole-of-life policy or beneficial ownership of a policy
taken out by Ultera.

<P>

52  	The minutes of order which counsel are preparing should include
orders giving effect to this decision.
