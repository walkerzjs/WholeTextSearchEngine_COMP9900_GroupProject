<b>MASTER McLAUGHLIN</b>
<P>

<i>Friday, 17 December 1999</i>
<P>

<b>4655/97	JUDITH ASTRID VANDERPUTT AND CYNTHIA VANDERPUTT    -v-    ROUDOLPH
FINLAY C. VANDERPUTT</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER</b>    These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act </i>1982</a>. 
<P>

2   	By summons filed on 6 November 1997 the plaintiffs Judith
Astrid Vanderputt and Cynthia Vanderputt each claim an order for
provision for
her maintenance, education and advancement in life out of the estate or the
notional estate of their mother, the late
Ruth Merlyn Vanderputt (to whom I
shall refer as "the deceased").
<P>

3   	The deceased died on 11 August 1997, aged 86 years. She
left a will dated 18 May 1997, probate whereof was on 19 September
1997 granted
to her son, Roudolph Finlay C. Vanderputt, the executor named in such will (who
is the defendant in the present proceedings).
By that will the deceased left
the entirety of her estate to the defendant.
<P>

4   	The defendant (who was born on 18 January 1930 and is
presently aged 69) is the eldest of the eight children of the deceased,
all but
one of whom survived the deceased (her only other son having died in 1987).
Only the two youngest children, Judith and Cynthia,
are making a claim against
the estate of their mother. 
<P>

5   	The significant asset in the estate is a house property
situate at and known as 1 Brooker Avenue, Oatlands (also referred to
and
apparently previously known as 15 Bettington Road, Oatlands), to which a value
of $175,000 was ascribed in the Inventory of Property.
The other assets
disclosed in the Inventory of Property are furniture ($1,000) and moneys held
by the Protective Commissioner ($20,539).

<P>

6   	A considerable degree of animus was manifested between the
plaintiffs and the defendant, at least on the part of the plaintiffs
towards
their brother. A very substantial part of the plaintiffs' evidence appeared to
be directed to the way in which, so it was
asserted by them, the defendant had
treated the deceased, with whom he lived substantially for most his adult life.

<P>

7   	Much of the evidence of the plaintiffs was directed to
establishing that the will which was admitted to probate was somehow
brought
about as a result of undue influence (or, possibly, coercion) exercised by the
defendant upon his mother. The second plaintiff
even went so far as to assert
that the defendant had forged all wills that purported to have been executed by
the deceased. However,
no attempt has been made by either the plaintiffs or any
of the other children of the deceased to challenge the validity of the will
which was admitted to probate. Indeed, Counsel for the plaintiffs expressly
stated that a conscious decision had been made by the
plaintiffs not to contest
its validity. Accordingly, I consider the entirety of the evidence concerning
the foregoing allegations
relating to the preparation and execution of the will
to be totally irrelevant to the present proceedings.
<P>

8   	Similarly, I do not consider to be of relevance or
significance the assertions which the plaintiffs made relating to alleged
ill-treatment of the deceased by the defendant. It must be recognised that,
whatever  might be the perception of the plaintiffs concerning
the relationship
between their brother and their mother, he was the sole object of the
testamentary beneficence of the deceased.
<P>

9   	I have already referred to the fact that one of the assets
of the estate disclosed in the Inventory of Property was moneys
held by the
Protective Commissioner. The involvement of the Protective Commissioner in the
affairs of the deceased was in consequence
of a Management Order under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">Protected Estates Act</i> 1983</a> which was made by the Guardianship Board on 9
June 1994. That order was in the following terms:
<P>

The BOARD being satisfied that Mrs Ruth Van Der Putt is not capable of managing
her affairs ORDERS THAT: ---
<P>

1.	The estate of Mrs Van Der Putt be subject to management under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">Protected Estates Act</a></i>, 1983.
<P>

2.	The management of Mrs Van Der Putt's estate be committed to the Protective
Commissioner. 
<P>

10   	There was admitted into evidence (as annexure B to the
affidavit of Joan Helen Hanna sworn 7 April 1999) that Management Order
and the
Reasons for Decision of the Guardianship Board for the making of the order. 
<P>

11   	Despite the considerable quantity of evidence concerning
the personal relationships between the deceased and her children
and concerning
the matters referred to in the Reasons for Decision of the Guardianship Board,
it seems to me, however, that these
proceedings are to be decided essentially
on the issues of the financial and material circumstances of the respective
parties.
<P>

12   	The first plaintiff, Judith, was born on 29 November 1949,
and is presently aged fifty. She is the youngest child of the deceased.
She
left school when she was aged sixteen, without being able to read or write.
According to her she remains illiterate, although
apparently she attends
remedial classes at work. For a period, when aged in her late teens, Judith
lived in a de facto relationship,
and gave birth to a daughter, but she has
never married. The deceased obtained sole custody of Judith's daughter when the
child was
aged three. Judith worked, apparently part-time, whilst her daughter
was a child. Since 1985 she has been in full-time employment,
firstly in a
factory, and latterly, since 1990 as a cleaner with the State Rail Authority,
at Asquith. In that position her net wage
is $700 a fortnight. 
<P>

13   	Judith suffers from anorexia and blood pressure, for which
she receives medical treatment. 
<P>

14   	Judith lives in extremely modest circumstances and
maintains a very frugal lifestyle. Since 1998 she has been residing in
rented
accommodation at Umina, which she describes as being small and uncomfortable.
She actually shares a room with another lady
in a house where she also has to
share kitchen and bathroom facilities. In order to be at work at Asquith by
7:00am it is necessary
for Judith to arise at 4:30am, and travel on foot, by
bus, by train and again on foot, to reach her place of employ. She normally
does not return home until about 6:30 or 6:45pm. 
<P>

15   	Apart from her wages Judith has no other income. She has
no assets other than her clothing. For her accommodation she pays
$85 a week.
Other details of her expenses are set forth in her affidavit of 28 September
1999.
<P>

16   	It is the desire of Judith that she should be enabled to
purchase a small home unit or villa on the Central Coast, close to
transport,
where she could live independently and on her own. Inquiries by her solicitor,
Mr Butler, disclosed that such accommodation
would from cost from $123,000 (one
bedroom unit) to $170,000 or more (two or three bedroom units). 
<P>

17   	In addition, Judith requires, as a matter of urgency, to
purchase necessary and basic items of household equipment, such as
a bed, table
and chairs, lounge, refrigerator, washing machine. The evidence discloses that
an amount of $5,000 would be required
for those purchases. 
<P>

18   	The second plaintiff, Cynthia, was born on 27 March 1944,
and is presently aged fifty-five. She is the second youngest child
of the
deceased. 
<P>

19   	Cynthia also left school aged sixteen, without being able
to read or write, and asserts that she remains illiterate. 
<P>

20   	After leaving school Cynthia supported herself in
employment, in factories, kitchens and the like. Cynthia left home in March
1986 and moved into her present residence at 13 Araluen Avenue, St Marys. She
said that the deceased organised the purchase of that
house for her by using
the moneys which Cynthia had saved from her earnings, together with a loan
(secured by mortgage) from the
Commonwealth Bank. Cynthia has remained in
residence in that house property to the present time.
<P>

21   	Cynthia has been in ill-health since 1980. She suffers
from diabetes, heart disease, disease of the nervous system, stress,
depression
and asthma. She takes various medications for those conditions. She has also
recently been diagnosed as suffering from
a cataract on her right eye.
<P>

22   	Cynthia's sole income consists of a disability pension in
a net amount of $8,640 a year. She has been an invalid pensioner
since about
1987.
<P>

23   	In July 1999 Cynthia received the sum of $10,000 by way of
a superannuation payment. (The evidence did not disclose the precise
source of
that payment.) She used that payment to discharge the indebtedness under her
mortgage ($8,000) and to pay for repairs ($2,000)
to her house property, which
is in a very dilapidated condition. 
<P>

24   	Apart from her house (to which was ascribed a value of
$40,000, representing, essentially, its land value) Cynthia's only
assets
consist of some aged furniture and her personal effects, and an account with
the State Bank ($2,665). She has no liabilities.
Details of her current annual
expenses are set forth in her affidavit of 28 September 1999. 
<P>

25   	Evidence was placed before the Court concerning the
considerable degree of dereliction of Cynthia's house property. Although
there
was evidence concerning the cost of demolition and rebuilding upon her property
at 13 Araluen Avenue, St Marys (the total cost
of such works being estimated at
$100,000), Cynthia in her oral evidence said that she was happy in her house,
that she was not interested
in selling and that she just wanted to stay where
she was.
<P>

26   	I should here observe that Cynthia, who in her oral
evidence manifested extreme detestation (not to say hatred) for her brother
the
defendant, did not attract the sympathy of the Court. She was unwilling to
answer questions properly asked of her in cross-examination,
and her response
to a number of those questions was of the nature "None of your business" or
"None of your business what I do". Her
evidence was given in an extremely
vehement fashion. The vehemence was directed, however, against her brother the
defendant, and
not towards advancing her own claim. She charged the defendant
with pestering, attacking and threatening her, and asserted that he
was the
cause of her ill health. 
<P>

27   	The claims of each plaintiff must be approached in the
context of any competing claims upon the testamentary bounty of the
deceased.
None of the other children of the deceased, apart from the two plaintiffs, has
made any claim against the estate of the
deceased. The defendant did not comply
with the requirements of Part 77 rule 59 of the Supreme Court Rules, in that he
did not make
an affidavit setting forth the various matters referred to in
subrule (1) thereof. Neither did he comply with the requirements of
Part 77
rule 63(1), in that he did not serve a notice of claim on each of the other
children of the deceased. Nevertheless, three
of those other children (Joan
Helen Hanna, Audrey Winsbury and Therese Corner) swore affidavits which were
filed on behalf of the
plaintiffs. Thus the only relevant competing claim is
that of the defendant, who is the chosen object of the testamentary beneficence
of the deceased, to the exclusion of all other persons. 
<P>

28   	It is not necessary for the defendant to prove anything.
However, if he is to be heard to resist the claim of the plaintiffs
upon the
ground that his financial and material circumstances are such that any order
for provision an entitlement to which either
or both of the plaintiffs might
otherwise have established should be reduced, or even extinguished, any such
submission must be made
upon the basis of evidence. The defendant (who, as I
have already observed, appeared for himself at the hearing; although
represented
by a solicitor at the earlier stages of the proceedings, he has
represented himself at least since July 1999) did not place before
the Court
any evidence concerning his financial circumstances. In particular, he did not
place before the Court any evidence concerning
his assets and liabilities,
income and expenditure. Neither did he at the hearing of the substantive claims
of the plaintiffs offer
any evidence relating to his health or medical
condition. (I note, however, that such evidence was placed before the Court in
support
of an application for an adjournment which was successfully made by the
defendant on 28 September 1999: see my judgment of that date.)

<P>

29   	It emerged from the evidence, however, that the defendant
owns a house property at 68 Main Road, Turnbridge in Tasmania. According
to the
defendant he paid $30,000 for that property, which he acquired in December
1993. Further, the structure on that property is,
according to the defendant,
of an extremely basic nature, and is suitable only for use as a storage place
for various possessions
of the defendant. In this latter regard, however, it
emerged that the defendant had resided in that residential property, from 1993
to 1995, and had, indeed, been joined there by the deceased for a period of
about five months, from March to August 1995. 
<P>

30   	In those circumstances, it is difficult to accept the
evidence of the defendant that the property in Tasmania is not suitable
for
human habitation. That assertion by the defendant is also inconsistent with the
valuation obtained by the plaintiffs (annexure
C to the affidavit of Eric
Richard Leslie Butler sworn 27 September 1999), being a valuation of R. L.
Jones, a certified practising
valuer, of Launceston, who valued the property at
$40,000. It should, however, be noted that that valuation was undertaken
without
an internal inspection, since the valuer had been unable to gain access
to the property. 
<P>

31   	According to his evidence the defendant has not been in
employment since 1973 or 1974. Although he appears to have pursued
some form of
tertiary studies since that time, essentially, according his evidence, the
defendant devoted almost the entirety of
his life in the period from when he
ceased employment until the death of the deceased in being the principal carer
for his mother.
I have already recorded that, apart from the period whilst he
was residing in Tasmania in 1993 - 1995, the defendant was residing
substantially with the deceased in the Oatlands property. 
<P>

32   	That house property has now been transmitted into the name
of the defendant. Since the death of the deceased he has been residing
there
alone. He described that property as having been his home for nearly thirty
years. According to a valuation obtained by the
plaintiffs, the house property
has a present value of $275,000, whilst a market appraisal suggests a value of
between $320,000 -
$330,000.
<P>

33   	Although there was no specific or precise evidence
proffered by the defendant concerning his income or the source thereof,
the
form of some of the questions asked by him in cross-examination of various
deponents of affidavits filed on behalf of the plaintiffs
suggested that the
defendant was in receipt of some form of a pension. There was, however, no
evidence concerning the nature or amount
of any such pension received by the
defendant. 
<P>

34   	Apart from the evidence to which I have just referred, and
the evidence concerning the property in Tasmania, the defendant
has not seen
fit to place before the Court any evidence concerning his financial and
material circumstances. In consequence, the
Court is entitled to proceed upon
the basis that those circumstances are not such as would have the effect of
reducing, or even extinguishing,
any order for provision an entitlement to
which either or both of the plaintiffs might otherwise have established. 
<P>

35   	The Court must still, however, recognise that the
defendant is the sole object of the testamentary beneficence of the deceased.
That is a relevant fact which is not open to challenge in the present
proceedings. 
<P>

36   	The gift of the entirety of her estate to the defendant
was made by the deceased in clause 3 of her will, as follows:
<P>

After payment of all my just debts funeral and testamentary expenses including
duties both Federal and State on the whole of my
real and personal estate I
MAKE the following GIFTS, BEQUESTS and DEVISES all of my real and personal
estate of whatsoever time and
wheresoever situate unto my son the said ROUDOLPH
FINLAY C. VANDERPUTT ABSOLUTELY, because of the natural love and affection
shown
to me by my son who has resided with me giving me care and comfort and
devotion in my years of greatest need. Because similar Wills
on 15th March 1991
13 August 1993 18 January 1994 are still missing and I still reject that 22nd
June 1993 Will my daughters Joan
and Therese had organised with the Board and
Public Trustee to suit themselves let there be no doubt that I leave to my
darling boy
Finlay whom I trust solely the heavy job to decide and do what is
best and that is my final wish. God bless him.
<P>

37   	Not only does the foregoing clause constitute the
dispository provisions of the will of the deceased. It also constitutes
a
statement made by the deceased, which, consequent upon the provisions of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 32(2)</a> of the  <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>, is admissible as evidence of
the facts stated therein.
<P>

38   	The defendant in the course of his cross-examination of
the plaintiffs, and also in his submissions, suggested that he would
be
prepared for one or other of the plaintiffs to reside with him in the house
property at Oatlands, which he said he wanted to be
a "haven" for all his
sisters. However, the personal relations obtaining between each of the
plaintiffs with the defendant are such
as to make such a proposal totally
unrealistic. Both the foregoing proposal and evidence describing the house
itself suggested that
it was a commodious residence more than adequate for the
accommodation of a single person.
<P>

39   	Each of the plaintiffs, as a child of the deceased, is an
eligible person within paragraph (b) of the definition of that phrase
contained
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>.</i> As such, each plaintiff is
an eligible person in relation to the deceased. As such, each plaintiff has the
standing to bring the
present proceedings. It will be appreciated that the
defendant also, as a child of the deceased, is an eligible person in relation
to the deceased, under the same paragraph of that definition.
<P>

40   	I am satisfied that each of the plaintiffs has been left
without adequate provision for her proper maintenance and advancement
in life
out of the estate of her late mother. I am satisfied that Judith has
established an entitlement to receive out of the estate
a legacy in an amount
sufficient to enable her to acquire a modest residence of the nature which she
desires in the Central Coast
area, together with an amount of $5,000 in order
to purchase necessary and basic items of furniture and household equipment. 
<P>

41   	The inquiries of Judith's solicitor, Mr Butler, disclosed
that she would be able to obtain a housing loan of about $40,000
or $50,000. A
modest home unit or villa in the location desired by Cynthia would cost no less
than $120,000. Since she would be able
to obtain a mortgage of about $40,000 or
$50,000, it seems to me appropriate that for the purposes of accommodation she
should receive
from the estate of her mother an amount of $80,000. To that sum
should be added an additional $5,000 for the purchase of necessary
and basic
items of furniture and household equipment of the nature to which I have
already referred. Accordingly, I propose to order
that Judith receive from the
estate of the deceased a legacy in the sum of $85,000.
<P>

42   	I am satisfied that Cynthia has established an entitlement
to receive from the estate of the deceased a legacy in an amount
sufficient to
enable her to effect essential repairs and restoration work to her residence
(costing about $40,000), together with
an amount of $5,000, for the acquisition
of urgently needed furniture and furnishings. Accordingly, I propose to order
that she receive
from the estate of the deceased a legacy in the sum of
$45,000.
<P>

43   	In the light of the valuation of the Oatlands house
property any sale thereof which may be the practical consequence of my
orders
herein will not of necessity result in the defendant being left without means
to acquire other accommodation. 
<P>

44   	Each of the plaintiffs has succeeded in obtaining an order
for provision for her maintenance out of the estate of the deceased.
The
plaintiffs will in consequence be entitled to an order that their costs be paid
out of the estate. Their solicitor has estimated
that those costs will total
$40,000. The defendant also, as executor, will be entitled to an order that he
receive his costs out
of the estate, although the practical benefit any such
order may be doubtful.
<P>

45   	Since the practical consequence of the foregoing orders
for provision for the plaintiffs, and for costs, is that, the defendant
(unless
he has assets of which the Court is not aware) must sell the Oatlands house
property, I consider that it is proper that the
foregoing legacies not bear
interest for a period of at least three months from the date of my orders.
<P>

46   	Accordingly, I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the plaintiff Judith Astrid Vanderputt receive out of the
estate of the late Ruth Merlyn Vanderputt ("the deceased")
a legacy in the sum
of $85,000, and that the plaintiff Cynthia Vanderputt receive out of the estate
of the deceased a legacy in the
sum of $45,000, each such legacy not to bear
interest if paid on or before  17 March 2000, and if not so paid to bear
interest at
Supreme Court rates.
<P>

2.	I order that the costs of the plaintiffs on the party and party basis and
the costs of the defendant on the indemnity basis be
paid out of the estate of
the deceased.
<P>

3.	The exhibits may be returned.
