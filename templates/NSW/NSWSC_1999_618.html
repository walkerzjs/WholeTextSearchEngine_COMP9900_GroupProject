<b>MASTER McLAUGHLIN</b>
<P>

<i>Tuesday. 22 June 1999</i>
<P>

<b>1426/99	GEORGE EDWARD HAME   -v-   ADRIAN JAMES KEMP   -   ESTATE OF AGNES
FORBES GRIFFITHS HAM</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:   </b>These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act </i>1982</a>.  By summons filed on 18 February 1999 the plaintiff,
George Edward Ham, claims an order for provision for his maintenance and
advancement
in life out of the estate of his late wife, Agnes Forbes Griffiths
Ham (to whom I shall refer as "the deceased").
<P>

2   	The deceased died on 25 September 1997, aged 91 years.  She
left a will dated 1 May 1996, probate whereof was, on 22 December
1997, granted
to Adrian Kemp, the executor named in such will (who is the defendant to the
present proceedings).  By that will the
deceased gave to the plaintiff a right
to reside in the house property situate at and known as 6 Hudson Street,
Whitebridge, which,
had been the matrimonial home of the plaintiff and the
deceased throughout the period of their marriage.  That right of residence
was
qualified in clause 4 of the will as follows:-
<P>

I DIRECT that my Husband GEORGE EDWARD HAM shall have the right to reside in my
home being the property situate and known as 6 Hudson
Street, Whitebridge
during his lifetime or until he remarries or enters into a defacto relationship
of man and wife or until he no
longer requires it PROVIDED THAT he personally
resides therein and pays all rates and taxes on the said property and keeps the
same
in a good and habitable state of repair (fair wear and tear excepted) and
also keeps the same insured against fire or other damage
to the satisfaction of
my Trustee.
<P>

3   	Clause 5 of the will is as follows:-
<P>

I DECLARE that should my aforesaid Husband no longer wish to reside in my said
real estate then my Trustee shall be entitled to
sell the said property and to
apply the proceeds of sale towards the purchase of another property of
equivalent value for the use
and occupation by my aforesaid Husband during his
lifetime.
<P>

4   	The deceased gave her furniture, chattels and household
effects to the plaintiff and gave the residue of her estate between
her two
children Adrian James Kemp and Helen Emily Bennett. The assets of the estate
consisted only of the house property at 6 Hudson
Street, Whitebridge and the
furniture in that property.  The present value of the Whitebridge property has
been agreed between the
parties as being $110,000.
<P>

5   	The plaintiff was born on 1 December 1913.  He is now 85
years of age.  Each of the plaintiff and the deceased had previously
been
married before they married each other on 20 December 1969.  At that time the
plaintiff was a widower and the deceased was a
widow.  Each of the plaintiff
and the deceased had children by his or her former marriage.  I have already
recorded that the deceased
had a son and a daughter;  the plaintiff had two
sons.  The plaintiff at the time of his marriage to the deceased owned a house
property.
 When they married he entered into residence with the deceased in her
Whitebridge property.  The plaintiff subsequently sold his
previous residence
at Belmont.  
<P>

6   	The plaintiff had been a miner by occupation.  After his
marriage he did some part-time work. In 1978, when he was age 65,
he retired
from employment and commenced to receive the Age Pension, which he still
receives.  He also receives a miner's pension.
 At the present time the
plaintiff's income is in a total amount of $426.20 a fortnight, consisting of
the Age Pension of $353.90
a fortnight and the miner's pension of $72.30 a
fortnight.  The plaintiff presently has savings of about $32,000, which savings
are
invested.
<P>

7   	The plaintiff has suffered ill health.  In the last year he
has suffered two cerebral haemorrhages, the most recent being only
a matter of
about two weeks ago.  He has only come out of hospital within the last couple
of days before the hearing.  The plaintiff
suffers problems with his vision.
He has no sight in his left eye and his vision in his right eye is impaired.
Because of his poor
eyesight the plaintiff does not cook for himself.  He
receives the benefits of Meals on Wheels throughout the week and at weekends
his daughter-in-law usually provides at least one meal for him.  The plaintiff
has not driven a motor car since his eyesight deteriorated.
 Apparently in her
later years the deceased was not able to cook and the plaintiff and the
deceased even during her lifetime received
some assistance from Meals on
Wheels.
<P>

8   	I have had the advantage of having the plaintiff give oral
evidence during the hearing and of seeing him in the witness box.
 He has some
problems with his hearing and also he has difficulty walking.  
<P>

9   	There has been placed before the Court evidence from Dr
Kelly McCann, a medical resident officer employed by the Hunter Area
Health
Service and currently working at the John Hunter Hospital at Newcastle, where
the plaintiff was most recently admitted on
8 June 1999.  Dr McCann has
provided a report dated 18 June 1999 setting forth the plaintiff's physical
problems.  In that report
under the heading "Physical", she says:-
<P>

[A]mbulant with walking stick with directions given.  Poor vision - needs Home
Care supervision twice daily for medication.  Receives
meals on wheels for
three days/week, otherwise independent.  Safe at home with services for the
moment.
<P>

10   	It would appear that some time ago, apparently one or two
years ago, the plaintiff, with the intention of residing therein
permanently,
went to a residential unit at an establishment known as Amaroo, which I gather
is a retirement establishment.  However,
the plaintiff suffered some problems
in his relationship with those administering that establishment and decided to
return home to
the Whitebridge residence.
<P>

11   	The plaintiff seeks an order that, in lieu of the right of
residence provided in the will of the deceased, he receive the
entire estate
absolutely.  The basis upon which it is submitted that such an order should be
made in his favour is the requirement
that he have both independence and
flexibility in his lifestyle.
<P>

12   	The defendant has in his affidavit made what is, in
effect, an open offer concerning the provision of accommodation for the
plaintiff in either a hostel or a nursing home.  That open offer has been
replicated by Mrs Bennett, the other beneficiary named
in the will of the
deceased.
<P>

13   	The defendant has placed before the Court evidence
concerning his financial and material circumstances.  He is presently
unemployed
on account of a work related injury.  His employment was terminated
in April of this year.  He had been employed by the Singleton
Hospital as an
engineer.  The defendant's wife also had her employment terminated.  They
presently live at Glennie's Creek near Singleton
in a home jointly owned by
them which is worth about $120,000.  The defendant has savings of about $6,000.
He, at the time of his
affidavit sworn on 22 April 1999, said that he would
receive superannuation which he would use to buy a needed new car, to effect
needed improvements to his residence and to fund a pension for his
retirement.
<P>

14   	Mrs Bennett owns her own home jointly with her husband.
They are self-funded retirees and are comfortable financially.  Mrs
Bennett is
aged 65.  The defendant is aged 61.
<P>

15   	It is in the light of the foregoing circumstances relating
to the financial and material situation of the plaintiff and of
each of the two
other named beneficiaries that the Court must approach the present claim.  
<P>

16   	The plaintiff, as the widower of the deceased, is an
eligible person within paragraph (a) of the definition of the phrase
contained
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>.  As such he has the
standing to bring the present proceedings.  Each of Mr Kemp and Mrs Bennett, as
a child of the deceased, is
also an eligible person in relation to the
deceased, being such an eligible person within paragraph (b) of that
definition.  
<P>

17   	I have already referred to the submission on behalf of the
plaintiff that after a marriage of almost 28 years, during much
of which he was
the principal breadwinner and during most of which he and the deceased
conducted a joint bank account, the plaintiff
should receive the house property
absolutely, so that in his declining years he will have both security and
flexibility in his accommodation
and in his lifestyle.
<P>

18   	The plaintiff in his oral evidence said that he wanted to
go back to the Whitebridge house.  It is commendable that he wishes
to remain
there as long as he can.  The medical condition of the plaintiff suggests,
however, that not merely is it unlikely that
he will be able to remain living
on his own in the Whitebridge house for very much longer, but it is probably
from his own point
of view undesirable, possibly even unsafe, that he continue
to do so.  
<P>

19   	However, the limited right of residence given by the will
and the further limited right provided by the will for the purchase
of a
subsidiary residence certainly do not make adequate provision for the plaintiff
in the circumstances which his years and his
physical health now require.
<P>

20   	The question is whether the house property should be given
to him absolutely or whether he should receive some more limited
form of
benefit which will allow him to remain in that house property as long as he is
capable of looking after himself and will
then allow him to enter into a
retirement village or, if necessary, a nursing home where he will be able to
receive whatever care
he needs.  
<P>

21   	In deciding that question, it seems to me that the Court
must properly consider the situation in which the beneficiaries find
themselves, in particular the defendant Mr Kemp.  The Court should not make an
order disturbing a will of a testator beyond what
is necessary to benefit the
applicant.  In the instant case it seems to me that the beneficiaries should
not be deprived of the totality
of the interest in remainder to which they are
entitled under the terms of their mother's will.
<P>

22   	I have reached the conclusion that the plaintiff is
entitled to an order of the nature of that prepared by Mr Blackburn-Hart
of
Counsel, for the defendant, but that the operation of such an order should come
into effect only at a time of the plaintiff's
own choosing when he is no longer
able to continue to look after himself on his own in the Whitebridge
residence.
<P>

23   	It is appreciated that the costs of the defendant must be
paid from the estate of the deceased.  He has carried out the obligation
of
defending the terms of the will of the deceased and therefore he should not be
out of pocket for carrying out that executorial
duty.  The costs of the
defendant are estimated to total about $12,000.  The costs of the plaintiff
himself are estimated to total
about $20,000.  The plaintiff has assets which
will be just sufficient to meet those two amounts of costs.  But if the costs
of the
defendant are to be paid out of the estate of the deceased, then, if the
plaintiff wishes to remain in the Whitebridge home for as
long as he can, he
will need to provide for the defendant's costs out of his own pocket. Otherwise
the defendant will be entitled
to sell and will be justified in selling the
house property in order to meet such order for costs.
<P>

24   	I propose, therefore, to make some emendations to the
draft short minutes which have been prepared by Mr Blackburn-Hart, which
will
give effect to the conclusions which I have just expressed in my reasons for
judgment.
<P>

25   	(Discussion ensued in relation to the Master's suggested
emendations to the short minutes)
<P>

26   	(Counsel addressed on costs)
<P>

27   	I make orders as in paragraph 5 of the short minutes of
order dated 22 June 1999, initialled by me and filed in Court this
day. I will
have a photocopy made of the short minutes as emended by me to be handed to
each Counsel.
