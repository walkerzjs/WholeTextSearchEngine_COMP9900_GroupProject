<P>

<b>			JOSE JOAO DE GOUVEIA &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Filing of amended statements of claim)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  In each of the matters referred to above the
plaintiff seeks that leave be granted to file further amended statements of
claim.
 The further amended statements of claim seeks to join solicitors Tina
Mary Moore and Jennifer Darin (except in the De Freitas proceedings
only Ms
Moore is sought to be joined as a defendant).  The solicitors who are sought to
be joined as defendants oppose the motions.
 The solicitor appearing for Mr and
Mrs De Freitas consented to the orders sought.
<P>

2  	It is necessary to refer to some background.  These proceedings
are one of about six proceedings which arise from three advances
made by
Citibank Savings Limited (Citibank) to Gabriel Jose De Freitas in respect of a
used car business conducted by him.  In the
first advance made to Mr and Mrs De
Freitas, Ms Moore, a solicitor acted for Citibank and signed a certificate of
independent advice.
 It is alleged the representations that she made in the
certificate were false.  In relation to the second advance made to Mr De
Freitas, it appears that Mr and Mrs De Gouveia and Mr and Mrs Caetano entered
into mortgages and first supplementary deed/s and sought
advice from the
solicitors.  In relation to the third advance made by Citibank to Mr De
Freitas, Mr and Mrs Caetano and Mr and Mrs
De Freitas allegedly entered into
second supplementary deed/s and sought advice from the solicitors.  Ms Darin, a
solicitor allegedly
gave a certificate of independent advice in relation to the
third advance.  Citibank has individual proceedings against each set
of husband
and wife.  There are separate proceedings commenced by Mr and Mrs De Gouveia
and Mr and Mrs Caetano as plaintiffs against
each of the solicitors who
provided legal advice.  
<P>

3  	The court has made orders that evidence in each of the following
proceedings be admitted as evidence in the other proceedings;
 (a) 12179 of
1992;  (b) 12117 of 1992;  (c) 12120 of 1992;  (d) 20935 of 1995 and (e) 20914
of 1995 (collectively the related proceedings).
 The plaintiffs now seek to
join the solicitors as defendants to these proceedings to enable all questions
between the parties to
be fully resolved at the hearing of the related
proceedings.  
<P>

4  	The plaintiff has also sought leave to join defendants pursuant
to Pt 8 r 8 of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b> (NSW).  Part 8 r 8(1)
provides:
<P>

<b>"Joinder of causes of action</b>
<P>

<b>1	A plaintiff may, in any proceedings, claim relief against the same
defendant in respect of more than one cause of action-</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	where the plaintiff claims, and the defendant is alleged to be liable,
in the same capacity in respect of all the causes of action;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	...</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	where the Court gives leave so to do.</b>
<P>

5  	and Pt 8 r 8(2) provides:
<P>

<b>"Joinder of parties generally</b>
<P>

<b>2	Two or more persons may be joined as plaintiffs or defendants in any
proceedings - </b>
<P>

<b>(a)	where</b>
<P>

<b> (i)	if separate proceedings were brought by or against each of them, as the
case may be, some common question of law or of fact would
arise in all the
proceedings;  and</b>
<P>

<b>(ii)	all rights to relief claimed in the proceedings (whether they are
joint, several or alternative) are in respect of or arise out
of the same
transaction or series of transactions;  or</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	where the Court gives leave so to do."</b>
<P>

6  	In <b><u>Walker v Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia</u></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20NSWLR%20496" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 NSWLR 496</a> at p 501, Needham J held that while the administration of
justice requires that litigation should be completed as soon as possible
and
that the issues should not be re-litigated, Pt 8 r 8(1)(b) nevertheless
requires that the joinder of a party be necessary for
the conduct of
proceedings.
<P>

7  	The solicitors Ms Moore and Ms Darin who are the parties that the
plaintiff seeks to join submitted that the proceedings are
out of time as the
essential acts relied upon by the plaintiff occurred in July 1988, October 1989
and August 1990.  However the
plaintiffs are taking proceedings against the
first defendants in each of the three proceedings the subject of this judgment
in relation
to defaults made in payments due pursuant to loan transactions.  It
is the defendants who have sought relief under the <b>Contract Review Act</b>
(NSW).  It can be argued by the plaintiff that damage will occur only if the
court makes an order that the mortgages be set aside.
 It will be at this point
that the loss can be crystallised.
<P>

8  	The plaintiff referred me to <b><u>Wardley Australia Limited
&amp; Anor v The State of Western Australia</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 514</a> where at
p 526 Mason CJ, Dawson, Gauldron and McHugh JJ sated:
<P>

<b>"When a plaintiff is induced by a misrepresentation to enter into an
agreement which is, or proves to be, to his or her disadvantage,
the plaintiff
sustains a detriment in a general sense on entry into agreement.  That is
because the agreement subjects the plaintiff
to obligations and liabilities
which exceed the value or worth of the rights and benefits which it confers
upon the plaintiff.  But,
as will appear shortly, detriment in this general
sense has not universally been equated with the legal concept of "loss or
damage".
 And that is just as well.  In many instances the disadvantageous
character or effect of the agreement cannot be ascertained until
some future
date when its impact upon events as they unfold becomes known or apparent and,
by then, the relevant limitation period
may have expired.  To compel a
plaintiff to institute proceedings before the existence of his or her loss is
ascertained or ascertainable
would be unjust.  Moreover, it would increase the
possibility that the courts would be forced to estimate damages on the basis of
likelihood or probability instead of assessing damages by reference to
established events.  In such a situation, there would be an
ever-present risk
of undercompensation or overcompensation, the risk of the former being the
greater."</b>
<P>

9  	The High Court said at p 533:
<P>

<b>"We should, however, state in the plainest of terms that we regard it as
undesirable that limitation questions of the kind under consideration
should be
decided in interlocutory proceedings in advance of the hearing of the action,
except in the clearest of cases.  Generally
speaking, in such proceedings
insufficient is known of the damage sustained by the plaintiff and of the
circumstances in which it
was sustained to justify a confident answer to the
question."</b>
<P>

10  	The Full Court in <b><u>Magman International Pty Ltd v Westpac
Banking Corporation</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1991/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] FCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2032%20FCR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 32 FCR 1</a> said that the question of whether
claims were statute barred could only be resolved after hearing evidence in the
particular case.
 It is my view that it is inappropriate to decide the issue of
whether or not the plaintiffs' claim is statute barred prior to the
hearing
whether the plaintiff's claim against the solicitors is statute barred is for
determination at the hearing.
<P>

11  	The solicitors submitted that the delay in joining them as
defendants is prejudicial because firstly 10 or 11 years have elapsed
and their
testamentary evidence will be stale;  secondly, that determining the course of
events and locating documents may be difficult
and thirdly, discovery and
pre-trial preparation is complete and the plaintiffs could have amended their
statement of claim after
the defences were filed in 1995 and 1996.  All of the
actions concern the same transaction and the issues which remain common in
all
matters is what advice was given the mortgagors and what did Ms Moore known
about Mr De Freitas when she advised both Citibank
and the De Freitas.  If the
solicitors are not joined as defendants and the plaintiff had orders under the
<b>Contracts Review Act</b> against it, it may then seek to commence fresh
proceedings against the solicitors.  This would involve witnesses being called
once
again to give evidence, additional expense and court time.
<P>

12  	It is regrettable that the parties have spent so much time
skirmishing on these interlocutory disputes.  It would have been
far more
beneficial and costs effective if the parties attempted to resolve how all
these claims could best be determined by the
Court.  It is my view that the
solicitors' submission that they suffer prejudice if they are joined as
defendants is not made out.
 They would have already been required to locate
documents in relation to the proceedings taken by the defendants against them
concerning
the legal advice they gave in relation to the transactions.  Whether
or nor the proceedings should be heard together and whether
or not Citibank
were to join the solicitors has been known to all the parties for a very long
time yet little has been usefully done
about it.  It is my view that there are
common transactions and overlap of witnesses that make it necessary and the
solicitor Tina
Mary Moore should be joined as second defendant pursuant to Pt 8
r 8 of the rules in proceedings 12120 of 1992.  For the same reasons
Tina Moore
and Jennifer Darin should be joined as second and third defendants respectively
in proceedings 11217/92 (Caetano matter)
and 12179/92 (the De Gouveia matter).
The plaintiff should also be granted leave to amend the statement of claim to
join these solicitors
as defendants and plead the case against them. The
plaintiff would normally pay the costs thrown away by the amendment.  However
the solicitors opposed the orders being sought.  It is my view that the
appropriate order is that costs be costs in the cause.
<P>

13  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	In 12120 of 1992 the plaintiff has leave to join Tina Mary Moore as second
defendant and to file a further amended statement
of claim within 14 days.
<P>

(2)	In 12179/92 the plaintiff has leave to join Tina Mary Moore as second
defendant and Jennifer Darin as third defendant and to
file a further amended
statement of claim within 14 days.
<P>

(3)	In 12117/92 the plaintiff has leave to join Tina Mary Moore as second
defendant and Jennifer Darin as third defendant and a
further amended statement
of claim is to be filed within 14 days.
<P>

(4)	Costs of the motions be costs in the cause.
<P>
