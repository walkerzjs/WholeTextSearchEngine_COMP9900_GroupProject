<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Delivered orally and revised on 22 July 1999)</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  There are three matters relating to New Cap
companies, Nos. 2388, 2515 and 2826 of 1999.  I propose now to deliver
orally
my reasons for judgment in respect of the orders which I made on 20 July
1999.
<P>

<b>Background facts</b>
<P>

2  	The applications before me today arise out of the failure of
certain of the New Cap group of companies including some Australian
subsidiaries with assets located in this country.  The structure of the group
is rather murky at this stage, but the evidence given
on behalf of Mr Gibbons,
one of the plaintiffs and an applicant before me, is as follows.  New Cap
Reinsurance Corporation Holdings
Ltd (`New Cap Holdings') was formed in Bermuda
in 1996 as an international reinsurance underwriting company.  It is registered
as
a foreign company in Australia.  It was listed on the Australian Stock
Exchange through a prospectus dated 4 November 1996.  It was
capitalised
through a USD150 million private placement in October 1996 and a USD12 million
initial public offering in December 1996.
 New Cap Reinsurance (Bermuda) Ltd
(`New Cap Bermuda'), which was formed in Bermuda and is licensed there as a
reinsurer, is probably
a wholly owned subsidiary of New Cap Holdings. New Cap
Bermuda is not registered as a foreign company in Australia.  New Cap Bermuda
owns just under 100% of the shares of NC Re Capital Ltd, an Australian company,
and there is some evidence that NC Re Capital is
the beneficial owner of all
the issued shares of New Cap Reinsurance Corporation Ltd (`New Cap Australia'),
which is also an Australian
company.
<P>

3  	It appears that companies in the group became insolvent by April
1999.  On 21 April 1999 John Gibbons of Ernst &amp; Young was
appointed
administrator of NC Re Capital Ltd and New Cap Australia under s 436A(1) of the
Corporations Law.  He intends convening
a meeting of creditors for 5 August
1999.  On 22 April 1999 John McKenna, of Ernst &amp; Young in Bermuda, was
appointed provisional
liquidator of New Cap Bermuda by the Supreme Court of
Bermuda, in proceedings in that court to wind up New Cap Bermuda on the just
and equitable ground.  On 3 June 1999 Young J of this Court appointed Mr
Gibbons as Australian provisional liquidator for New Cap
Holdings and New Cap
Bermuda in proceedings which I shall describe later.
<P>

4  	There is evidence before me that as at 30 April 1999 the total
assets of New Cap Bermuda amounted to just under USD180 million
(including
investments, bank deposits and cash of about USD105 million), and total
liabilities were about USD212 million, leaving
a deficiency of about USD32
million. The company's operating loss before abnormals for the period
(presumably the year) ended 30
April 1999 was about USD49 million, and after
abnormals which comprised writing down its investment in a subsidiary and
writing off
loans to its holding company, its operating loss was about USD186
million.
<P>

5  	As to New Cap Australia, there is a discrepancy between the
directors' report as to affairs which was prepared on a going concern
basis,
and the views of Mr Gibbons as administrator reflected in his draft report to
creditors. Mr Gibbons takes the view that it
is inappropriate to account for
underwriting transactions on a going concern basis under which balances would
be recorded for unearned
premium, deferred acquisition costs and deferred
reinsurance premium. He prefers to treat underwriting transactions on a run-off
basis.  In the result, the directors' report records total assets of USD373
million, total liabilities of USD416 million and net
liabilities of USD43
million; while Mr Gibbons' provisional view is that total assets are USD251
million, total liabilities are USD455
million and net liabilities are USD203
million.
<P>

6  	In January 1997 New Cap Australia and New Cap Bermuda entered
into a USD150 million letter of credit agreement with the Chase
Manhattan Bank,
Sydney Branch (Chase) as Issuing Bank and Administrative Agent for various
banks and Bank of Bermuda (New York) Ltd
as Collateral Agent.  Under that
facility New Cap Australia and New Cap Bermuda could request the issue by Chase
of letters of credit
from time to time. They have used the facility to have
letters of credit issued to secure the payment of obligations under contracts
of reinsurance.  They are obliged under the facility to pay fees and reimburse
and indemnify Chase if Chase becomes obliged to make
payment to the beneficiary
of a letter of credit. 
<P>

7  	Each of them also entered into a contemporaneous `Collateral
Agreement' (that is, an agreement for provision of collateral or
security) with
Chase as Administrative Agent and Bank of Bermuda (New York) Ltd as Collateral
Agent to provide security for other
obligations under the letter of credit
facility.  In each case the Collateral Agreement was subsequently amended in
June and November
1998 in several significant ways, including replacement of
Bankers Trust Co for Bank of Bermuda (New York) Ltd as the Collateral
Agent,
and an alteration to the charging clause.  Only the original Collateral
Agreement with respect to New Cap Australia has been
registered as a charge
under the Corporations Law.
<P>

8  	It appears that Bankers Trust Co was replaced by Chase Capital
Markets Fiduciary Services Ltd (`Chase Fiduciary Services') as
the Collateral
Agent with respect to both Collateral Agreements on about 22 April 1999, but
according to the plaintiffs' evidence
the circumstances under which this
occurred are unclear.  The matter is referred to in an affidavit by Roger
William Dobson of 27
May 1999 paragraph 7.6.
<P>

9  	Clearly a significant question for the unsecured creditors of New
Cap Australia and New Cap Bermuda is whether the Collateral
Agreements create
valid securities over assets which might otherwise be available for
distribution to them.  As I shall indicate,
the assets which the defendants
before me assert to be subject to the securities are very  substantial.  As
regards New Cap Australia
there is a particular interest possessed by a group
of creditors by virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/s116.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 116(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Act 1973</a> (Cth).  That
provision requires that the company's assets in Australia not be applied in
discharge of its liabilities other than
its liabilities in Australia unless it
has no liabilities in Australia.
<P>

<b>Proceedings</b>
<P>

10  	The applications which are the subject of these reasons for
judgment arise out of three proceedings in this Court. Proceeding
2388/99 is an
application by summons by New Cap Bermuda, and Mr McKenna as its Bermudan
provisional liquidator, for an order for
winding up so far as its assets in
Australia are concerned.  On 3 June 1999 Young J appointed a provisional
liquidator, exercising
jurisdiction under the Corporations Law of New South
Wales as well as cross-vested jurisdiction under the Corporations Law of
Victoria.
 For the purposes of the motion before him, his Honour held that
there was a prima facie case that New Cap Bermuda, though not a
registered
foreign company, carried on business in New South Wales and Victoria and was,
therefore, a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/index.html#p5.7" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5.7</a> body for the purposes of the winding up provisions of the
Corporations Law.
<P>

11  	Proceeding 2515/99 is an application by summons by New Cap
Australia and its administrator, Mr Gibbons, for declarations that
a certain
security is void against the administrator or does not extend to specific
assets, and an order that the defendants account
for those assets to the
plaintiffs.  The defendants in those proceedings are Chase and Chase Fiduciary
Services.  The defendants
claim security interests in amounts of USD60.128
million and Stg 5.583 million held in accounts with Chase's Sydney Branch, held
(say the plaintiffs) to the credit of Chase Fiduciary Services.  I shall refer
to them as the assets claimed by New Cap Australia.
 The summons also seeks
directions to Mr Gibbons as administrator under s 447D of the Corporations Law
as to the manner of resolution
of the issues concerning whether the security is
void as against him, whether the security extends to the assets claimed by the
defendants,
and whether the defendants are liable to account to the plaintiffs
for those assets.  The directions which are sought include directions
whether
it is appropriate for Mr Gibbons to prosecute proceedings 2515/99 for the final
relief sought in the summons, and to seek
joinder of a representative unsecured
creditor in those proceedings, and to conduct any necessary examinations under
ss 596A and
B of the Corporations Law.
<P>

12  	Proceeding 2826/99 is an application by summons by New Cap
Bermuda by its Australian provisional liquidator, against Chase
and Chase
Fiduciary Services as defendants, either for a declaration that the defendants
hold no security over assets of the plaintiff
held or controlled by them and an
order for the defendants to account to the plaintiff for those assets, or,
alternatively, for an
order that the defendants account to the plaintiff for
the balance of the assets after satisfaction of their secured debts.  The
evidence indicates that the assets which are the subject of the defendant's
claim for security include an account in the sum of USD107<b> </b>million with
Chase's Sydney Branch.  The exact designation of the account, a matter which
may be very material, is not clear on the
evidence before me at this stage.
<P>

13  	In both proceedings 2515 and 2826 there are carefully drawn
interlocutory injunctions in place, evidently designed to preserve
the assets
in this jurisdiction in which the  defendants claim to have security interests.
New Cap Australia has given the usual
undertaking as to damages and New Cap
Bermuda has given the usual undertaking, but has limited the undertaking to its
assets within
New South Wales and Victoria.  Mr Gibbons has given the usual
undertaking, but has limited the undertaking to the amount ultimately
available
to him as administrator pursuant to his right to an indemnity out of New Cap
Australia's assets.  The orders presently
in force were first made on 27 May
and 21 June 1999 respectively.  Prior to my dealing with the present
applications yesterday, the
orders were due to expire at 5pm on that day unless
any order were made (as I did) to extend their operation.
<P>

14  	By letter dated 7 July 1999 the solicitors for the defendants in
both proceedings indicated that the defendants intended to
contest the
continuation of the injunctions `on the adequacy of [the plaintiffs']
undertaking as to damages'. On 13 July 1999 the
plaintiffs' solicitors
responded, asking to be informed `of the nature and extent of any loss or
damage to which [the defendants]
consider they are exposed by the reason of the
injunction'.  The defendants' solicitors replied by two letters, each dated 14
July
1999, one for each of these two proceedings.
<P>

15  	By those letters the defendant claimed that New Cap Australia
and New Cap Bermuda were in default under the letter of credit
facility and
their collateral agreements and that Chase was, therefore, entitled to enforce
the security which it held against them.
 If it did so, the letter said, it
could deploy the funds elsewhere.  The letters annexed schedules which
indicated the security
position of each company.  In the case of New Cap
Australia the letter indicated secured obligations of some USD58 million plus
Stg
5.846 million, and loan values of USD60.57 million and Stg 5.622 million.
Consequently, there was surplus collateral of USD2.54 million
and Stg 0.136
million.  In the case of New Cap Bermuda the secured obligations were stated to
be USD91.83 million and Stg 8.85 million
and the loan values were USD97.356
million and USD10.325 million leaving no surplus collateral in the latter case
and surplus capital
of USD5.236 million in the former case.
<P>

16  	According to the letters of 14 July 1999 the defendants claimed
that the measure of any damages which Chase may suffer by reason
of the
continuance of the injunctions should be quantified as the difference between
the return Chase is presently earning on its
investment and the return it would
otherwise enjoy if it was able to enforce the security and redeploy the funds.
An estimate of
that loss totalling approximately USD430,000 per annum was
given.  The letters respectively said that the loss was proportioned as
to
USD150,000 to New Cap Australia and as to USD280,000 to New Cap Bermuda.  The
letters required, as a term of any orders for continuance
of injunctions,
acknowledgments by the plaintiffs in both proceedings that the surplus
collateral held by the defendants secures
the plaintiffs' obligation to pay
damages which the defendants may suffer as a result of the continuation of the
injunctions.
<P>

17  	The letters also asserted the view that the defendants would be
entitled to be indemnified by the plaintiffs for the costs
incurred in
defending the proceedings pursuant to clause 8.03 of the letter of credit
agreement and clause 6.03 of the respective
collateral agreements.  Those costs
were said to total USD450,000 as at 8 July 1999.  In light of the substantial
costs which were
being incurred, the defendants required a written
acknowledgment from the plaintiffs in both proceedings that if an order were to
be subsequently made for the plaintiffs to pay the defendants' costs, those
costs may be paid from surplus collateral held by the
defendants.
<P>

18  	The plaintiffs' solicitors responded to these letters, by
letters dated 15 and 16 July.  In those letters the plaintiffs in
both
proceedings gave the acknowledgments which the defendants sought, subject to
this Court directing Mr Gibbons that, in proceeding
2515 of 1999 he was
justified in giving the acknowledgments as administrator and also causing New
Cap Australia to give the acknowledgments;
 and in proceeding 2826 of 1999 he
was justified in causing New Cap Bermuda (the sole plaintiff in that
proceeding) to give the acknowledgments.

<P>

19  	The applications which came before me on Monday 19 July 1999
were brought by Notice of Motion in proceeding 2388/99 and by
Notice of Motion
and pursuant to the Summons in proceeding 2515/99.  By the motion in the former
proceeding Mr Gibbons, as Australian
provisional liquidator of New Cap Bermuda,
seeks directions in connection with the exercise of his functions or powers as
provisional
liquidator under s 479(3) of the Corporations Law.  In the latter
case Mr Gibbons, as administrator of New Cap Australia, seeks directions
in
connection with the exercise of his functions or powers as administrator under
s 447D.  Since I decided on 20 July 1999 to grant
the substantial relief sought
by the plaintiffs as applicants and I made orders accordingly, the simplest way
of explaining the relief
sought by the applicants is to set out the orders
which I made on that day.  I ordered as follows:
<P>

	<b>Proceeding 2388 of 1999</b>
<P>

1.	The provisional liquidator, Mr John Gibbons, is justified in:
<P>

(a)	commencing and prosecuting proceedings no. 2826 of 1999;  and
<P>

(b)	causing the first plaintiff, New Cap Bermuda, to provide acknowledgments in
the terms set out in the letter from Henry Davis
York to Allen Allen &amp;
Hemsley dated 16 July 1999 being the letter marked `JKM4' annexed to the
affidavit of John Kenneth Martin
sworn 16 July 1999.
<P>

<b>Proceeding 2515 of 1999</b>
<P>

The administrator (Mr John Gibbons, the second plaintiff in proceeding 2515 of
1999) is justified in
<P>

(a)	seeking in this proceeding:
<P>

	(i)	a declaration that the Security (as defined in the second schedule to the
Summons) is void against the Administrator;
<P>

(b)	causing the first plaintiff to seek in this proceeding:
<P>

	(ii)	a declaration that the first defendant, Chase or the second defendant,
Chase Fiduciary Services hold no security interest,
under the Security or
otherwise, in respect of the Assets as defined in the third schedule to the
Summons;
<P>

(c)	seeking and causing the first plaintiff to seek in these proceedings:
<P>

	(iii)	an order that Chase and/or Chase Fiduciary Services account for the
Assets to New Cap Australia and the Administrator;
<P>

(d)	providing acknowledgments in the terms set out in the letter from Henry
Davis York to Allen Allen &amp; Hemsley dated 15 July
1999 being the letter
marked `JKM4' annexed to the affidavit of John Kenneth Martin sworn 15 July
1999;
<P>

(e)	causing the first plaintiff, New Cap Australia, to provide acknowledgments
in the terms set out in the letter from Henry Davis
York to Allen Allen &amp;
Hemsley dated 15 July 1999 being the letter marked `JKM4' annexed to the
affidavit of John Kenneth Martin
sworn 15 July 1999.
<P>

<b>The issues alleged by the plaintiffs</b>
<P>

20  	The plaintiffs say that it is appropriate for them to bring and
maintain proceedings 2515/99 and 2826/99 because in their view
there is a
reasonable prospect of obtaining orders which would have the effect that very
substantial assets in Australia would be
freed from any claim by the defendants
under the collateral agreements.  They say it is appropriate for them to give
the acknowledgments
sought by the defendants, in order to secure the
continuation of injunctions and thereby preserve substantial assets within the
jurisdiction.
 Their case arises in the following way.
<P>

21  	In the Collateral Agreement affecting New Cap Australia the
charging clause (3.01) grants the security to `the Administrative
Agent, for
the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Banks as
hereinafter provided'.  `Issuing Bank' and
`Banks' are defined in the letter of
credit agreement. The Issuing Bank is Chase Manhattan, Sydney Branch in its
capacity as issuer
of letters of credit.  The property charged by the
Collateral Agreement includes the Collateral Account, the US Treasury
securities
credited from time to time to the Collateral Account and all cash
held from time to time in the Collateral Account, and other ancillary
interests.  `Collateral Account' is defined in clause 1 as `one or more cash
and securities collateral accounts in the name of the
Administrative Agent
established and maintained by the Collateral Agent'.  In its original form the
Collateral Agreement provided
that it could only be amended by an instrument in
writing executed by the Company and the Collateral Agent (clause 6.05).  The
original
Collateral Agent was, as I have mentioned, the Bank of Bermuda (New
York).  Pursuant to clause 6.09(a) the Agreement is governed
by New York law.
There is some evidence on what New York law would say on relevant issues of law
and construction.
<P>

22  	As far as the New Cap Australia Collateral Agreement is
concerned, the plaintiffs have broadly two kinds of contention with
respect to
the validity and efficacy of the charge asserted by the defendants.  The first
arises out of the charging clause. The
original Collateral Agreement created a
charge in favour of the Administrative Agent, namely Chase, for its benefit and
the benefit
of other specified banks.  The subsequent Amending Agreements
purported to alter the charging clause by providing that the security
was
granted to the `the Collateral Agent, for its benefit and for the
Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank and the Bank as hereinafter
provided'.  The
plaintiffs claim that the Amending Agreements did not amend the original
charging clause because they were not executed
by the Bank of Bermuda (New
York) as required by the original Collateral Agreement.  They claim that the
defendants cannot assert
that assets remain subject to the charge in the
original Collateral Agreement because the defendants did not purport to hold
assets
pursuant to the Original Agreement after the amendments were made;  and
there has been no assignment or other succession from the
Bank of Bermuda (New
York) to Chase Fiduciary Services;  and there was no power for Chase to replace
Bankers Trust Co with Chase
Fiduciary Services under the original Collateral
Agreement.  They assert that any charge arising under the Amending Agreements
cannot
give security over the Collateral Account to which the original
Collateral Agreement refers.  They point to the fact that the two
Amending
Agreements were entered into by parties which did not include the Original
Collateral Agent.  They also point to the fact
that neither of the Amending
Agreements was registered under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ia1973116/index.html#p2k" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2K</a> of the Corporations Law, and they
contend that lodgment for registration was necessary under s 263.  They
therefore say that any
charge created for the benefit of the Collateral Agent
pursuant to the Amending Agreements is not a charge which is valid against
Mr
Gibbons as Administrator having regard to s 266 of the Corporations Law.  
<P>

23  	The second broad issue in respect of the New Cap Australia
relates to the proper construction of the definition of `Collateral
Account'.
As I have mentioned, according to that definition the Collateral Account is an
account in the name of the Administrative
Agent established and maintained by
the Collateral Agent.  The two accounts to which I have referred are, according
to the plaintiff,
accounts maintained by Chase as banker in the name of the
Chase Fiduciary Services.  In other words, the plaintiffs say that the
accounts
do not fall within the definition of `Collateral Account' because the roles of
Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent
has been reversed, even if one
assumes that Chase Fiduciary Services is properly the Collateral Agent in the
present circumstances.
 There is some evidence before me that the styling of
the two accounts has been changed in recent times.  It may be that the change
reflects some substantive alteration of legal rights having the effect that the
two accounts now fall within the definition of `Collateral
Account' even
though, at an earlier time, they may not have done so. I am not in a position
to make a determination on this point,
except to say that there appears on the
present evidence to be some substance in the plaintiffs' view that the accounts
are still
properly described as accounts with Chase in the name of Chase
Fiduciary Services.
<P>

24  	As far as New Cap Bermuda is concerned, the Collateral Agreement
is in somewhat different terms and the issue of registration
of the charge does
not arise.  Nonetheless, there are still basic questions with respect to the
nature and effect of the charging
clause and the definition of `Collateral
Account' which are broadly the same as, or are analogous to, the questions with
respect
to New Cap Australia  which I have outlined.  There are inconsistencies
in the evidence about the designation of the account for
USD107 million, some
evidence indicating that it is an account of Chase and other evidence
indicating (as the plaintiff contends)
an account of Chase Fiduciary Services.
On the present evidence the plaintiff's contention is not without substance.
<P>

25  	No doubt, the defendants will have a great deal to say about the
matters to which I have referred.  I note that although the
defendants were
aware of the applications which were made to me under ss 479(3) and 447D, they
chose to seek to be excused and did
not appear at the hearing of the
applications on 19 July 1999.  The plaintiffs' evidence indicates that some of
the issues which
will be raised by the defendants include questions of
rectification and set-off.
<P>

26  	In all the circumstances, it appears to me the plaintiffs are
correct when they say that important issues of law and construction
reasonably
arise out of the material presently before the Court, which could have the
effect that substantial assets would be available
to satisfy the claims of
unsecured creditors of the two companies.  The base issues outlined above may
well lead to others.  In his
affidavits of 27 May and 21 June 1999 Mr Dobson,
who is a solicitor with substantial experience in banking and finance law, sets
out succinctly the issues which arise, in his opinion, out of the facts and
circumstances which I have outlined.  On the evidence
before me, my opinion is
that there is a reasonably arguable case for the plaintiffs on those issues.
Mr Dobson's formulations of
issues are:
<P>

<b>New Cap Australia Agreement</b>
<P>

`8.1.1	Is New Cap's interest in the cash held by Chase Fiduciary Services in
the accounts ... caught by a charge to or for the benefit
of Chase? ...
<P>

8.1.2	Does the Amending Agreement create a new charge? ...
<P>

8.1.3	If the Amending Agreement creates a new charge, is that charge
registrable under the Corporations Law? ...
<P>

8.1.4	Assuming the Amending Agreement creates a new charge which was
registrable under the Corporations Law but which was not registered
within the
time prescribed under the Corporations Law, can the failure to register the
Amending Agreement be rectified? ...
<P>

8.1.5	If the Amending Agreement was registrable as a charge under the
Corporations Law and, as a result of a failure to register
it, it is void as a
security as against the Administrator, what effect (if any) does the Original
Collateral Agreement have?  In
particular, does it operate as charge over any
of the assets of the New Cap and if so, what assets does it cover? ...
<P>

8.1.6	What is the effect of the Second Amending Agreement and in particular,
does it amount to a new charge and if so, is it registrable
under the
Corporations Law? ...
<P>

8.1.7	What right does Chase have (if any) to claim a current entitlement to the
cash held in the accounts ... under any right to
set-off or under any similar
right? ...
<P>

8.1.8	Assuming Chase has no effective charge in respect of the cash held in the
accounts ... and assuming that it either has no
present existing right of
set-off in relation to that cash or, if it has a current right of set-off, that
right only extends to part
of the cash, can the administrator compel Chase to
deliver up all of the cash which is not caught by a current right of
set-off?'
<P>

<b>New Cap Bermuda Agreement</b>
<P>

`7.1	Is New Cap Bermuda's interest in the money held in the account ... caught
by a charge to, or for the benefit of, Chase Manhattan?
 To a large extent this
will depend on whether that money is in a `Collateral Account'. ...
<P>

7.2	Does the position regarding the way in which the money ... is held
represent a change to the position as it was on or about
the date of the
appointment of John McKenna as the provisional liquidator of New Cap Bermuda or
a change to the position as it was
on or about the date of the appointment of
John Gibbons as provisional liquidator of the NSW and Victorian assets of New
Cap Bermuda?
 Some of the information we have seen suggests that the position
may have changed.  If it did change, was that change proper and/or
effective?
...
<P>

7.3	What right does Chase Manhattan have (if any) to claim a current
entitlement to the money held in the account ... under any
right of set-off?
...
<P>

7.4	Assuming Chase Manhattan has no effective charge in respect of the money
held in the account ... and assuming that it either
has no current right of
set-off in relation to that money or, if it has a current right of set-off,
that right only extends to part
of the money, can Mr Gibbons as the provisional
liquidator of the NSW and Victorian assets of New Cap Bermuda compel Chase
Manhattan
to deliver up all of the money which is not caught by a current right
of set-off?'
<P>

<b>The Court's Role</b>
<P>

Section 479(3) of the Corporations Law provides:
<P>

`The liquidator may apply to the Court for directions in relation to any
particular matter arising under the winding up.'
<P>

In the case of company administration s 447D(1) provides: 
<P>

`The administrator of a company under administration, or of a deed of company
arrangement, may apply to the Court for directions
about a matter arising in
connection with the performance or exercise of any of the administrator's
functions and powers.'
<P>

Section 479(3) confers a broad jurisdiction on the court to provide guidance to
a liquidator (or provisional liquidator) regarding
matters of law or
principle<b>:  </b><i>Re G B Nathan &amp; Co Pty Limited (in liq)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2024%20NSWLR%20674" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 24
NSWLR 674.</a>  The court is prepared to provide guidance in cases where directions
are appropriate in order to protect the liquidator or provisional
liquidator
against accusations of acting unreasonably:<b> </b><i>Sanderson v Classic Car
Insurances Pty Ltd</i><b> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%2010%20ACLR%20115" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 10 ACLR 115.</a>  The same principles apply in
the case of an application for directions by an administrator under s 447D(1):
<b> </b><i>Editions Tom Thompson Pty Ltd v Pilley</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2024%20ACSR%20617" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 24 ACSR 617.</a>  The
court is unlikely to act in a case which involves substantial contested issues
of fact or credit.  However, as far as I can
see this is not so in the present
circumstances, which predominantly raise issues of law and construction in the
context of narrow
factual issues about the designation of bank accounts.  The
correct approach for the court to take in applications such as the present
one
is set out by Mansfield J in<b> </b><i>Re Addstone Pty Limited (in liq)</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2025%20ACSR%20357" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 25 ACSR 357</a> at 371:
<P>

`The court's functions, in my view, are limited to being satisfied that the
material before it is sufficient to determine whether
the prospects of success
lie in the general range of high, reasonable or minimal, and having regard to
the potential benefits, and
those prospects, and to the resources available to
the liquidator either from the company's resources or from other funding
options,
whether it is appropriate to now bring the proceedings to an end.'
<P>

27  	Applying that approach to the circumstances of the present case,
I had no hesitation in making the directions which the plaintiffs
sought.
While it is not necessary or appropriate for me to enter into the substantial
merits of the plaintiffs' case, I am persuaded
by the evidence before me that
their case is reasonably arguable and that considerations of balance of
convenience justify giving
of directions and the maintaining of the
proceedings.  By that I mean that in the present case it is appropriate to
allow the plaintiffs
to maintain proceedings which may ultimately give them
access to assets of a very substantial amount, and may in the meantime preserve
those assets within the jurisdiction by means of interlocutory relief.  That,
it seems to me, is an appropriate way of providing
protection to the creditors
of  those companies to the extent that this Court is in a position to do so.

<P>

28  	I have carefully considered the undertakings which the
plaintiffs have given as to damages in order to obtain continuation
of the
interlocutory relief which is currently in place, and the acknowledgments
sought by the defendants.  It seems to me, having
regard to the correspondence
between the parties and especially the letters of the defendants' solicitors
which I have described
fully, that the defendants will not be unduly prejudiced
provided that my directions authorise Mr Gibbons to cause the plaintiffs
to
give the acknowledgments which the defendants seek.  In my view the plaintiffs'
undertakings as to damages are reasonable and
appropriate in the circumstances.
The acknowledgments by the plaintiffs with respect to surplus collateral are an
appropriate and
probably necessary step for them to take in order to secure the
continuation of interlocutory relief which is highly desirable from
the
viewpoint  of unsecured creditors.  The power to give the acknowledgments
exists in the case of an administrator under s 437A
and in the case of a
provisional liquidator under s 477(2).  This would be so, in the context of
undertakings given to secure interim
relief in the interests of unsecured
creditors, even if the acknowledgments were regarded as creating or enhancing
security interests.
 
<P>

29  	In all the circumstances, it seems to me that this is a case
where the overwhelming considerations of justice and fairness
require that the
Court provide some protection to Mr Gibbons as administrator and provisional
liquidator by giving appropriate directions
and I have therefore done so.
<P>

30  	I shall hear any submissions which the parties wish to make
concerning the costs of the applications to which these reasons
relate.
However, I will need substantial persuasion to do anything other than to order
that the costs of the applications be costs
of the proceedings.
<P>
