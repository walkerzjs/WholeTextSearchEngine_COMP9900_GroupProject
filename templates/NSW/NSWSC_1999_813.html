<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Imputations - capacity - form - hypocrisy)</b>
<P>

1   	The plaintiff, Mr Geoffrey Lawson, has instituted
proceedings against the defendants claiming damages for defamation arising
from
causes of action constituted by imputations said to be carried by a broadcast
on 5 January 1999.
<P>

2   	Appended to these reasons is a transcript of the words
spoken by Mr Hadley in the broadcast complained of.  
<P>

3   	The plaintiff contends that the publication carries the
following imputations:
<P>

<i>"(a)	the plaintiff is deceitful because he did not disclose he was a member
of the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust when defending the
Sydney Cricket Ground as
a venue;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	</i><cite>the plaintiff is a hypocrite</cite><i>;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	</i><cite>the plaintiff so conducted himself that he was held in
contempt and ridicule by his former team mates and colleagues</cite><i>;</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	the plaintiff so conducted that he was sacked as coach of the New South
Wales cricket side;</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	</i><cite>the plaintiff is unfit to be a member of the Sydney Cricket
Ground Trust because he is psychiatrically disturbed</cite><i>".</i>
<P>

4   	The defendant contends that the matter complained of is
incapable as matter of law of conveying imputations (b), (c) and (e).
Accordingly, pursuant to SCR Pt 31 a preliminary trial was conducted to
determine to issue.
<P>

5   	At this point it is appropriate to remark that it is
desirable, if not necessary, that the question of "<i>capacity"</i> be
determined by reference to the publication sued upon in its original form.  By
that I mean, obviously, in the case of a radio
broadcast by reference to an
audio tape;  a television broadcast by reference to a video tape and a written
publication by reference
to that publication in its original published state.
The determination of such an application may be aided by a transcript in the
first two cases or a typed version in the third case.  The judge who determines
the question of capacity should do so on the material
that could become the
evidence before the jury for its determination of the relevant issue of
fact.
<P>

6   	I deal first with imputation (e) because it easily can be
disposed of.  In my view, there is no need to embark upon an analysis
to
identify what is said by counsel for the defendant to be the proscribed
"<i>inference upon inference</i>" process the ordinary reasonable listener
would have to use to arrive at such a meaning.  Upon hearing the program and
with the aid
of the transcript I can safely conclude that no ordinary
reasonable listener could in any way understand the program to be conveying
any
such meaning.  The reference to "<i>medical condition</i>" at line 82 and the
clear attempt at humour in the whole of the paragraph comprising lines 80 to 86
simply does not lend itself,
by itself or with any other part of the matter
sued upon, as a reasonable basis for such an imputation.  I do not consider
there
to be any need to say anything further in respect to that imputation.
<P>

7   	As to imputation (c) this rests principally upon line 67 to
86.  The defendant argues that the imputation has been "<i>pitched too
high</i>".  I agree.  What is clear is that the expression in lines 69-70,
"<i>I found it difficult to actually get a rap for him</i>" can constitute a
sting to the effect that nobody could say a nice thing about Mr Lawson or that
he was unpopular.  The wording of
the imputation itself being a "<i>so
conducted himself</i>" imputation (which in my respectful view should be
eschewed) facilitates the conclusion that the ordinary reasonable listener
would
not understand the references to Mr Lawson in the part of the program to
which I have referred as conveying a meaning in those terms.
<P>

8   	As I have indicated however, there is material there that
does constitute a "<i>sting</i>" and the plaintiff will have leave to amend to
attempt to "<i>capture</i>" it.  I hold that imputation (c) is incapable as a
matter of law of being conveyed by the matter complained of.
<P>

9   	Imputation (b) is the most problematical as indeed was
acknowledged by Mr Smark of counsel for the defendant.  There is of
course a
question of form.  The imputation is bad in form because it does not indicate
the way in which Mr Lawson is in fact a hypocrite.
 If the program merely used
the word "<i>hypocrite"</i> without more then the plaintiff could safely plead
it.
<P>

10   	It is appropriate here to deal with what was submitted for
the defendant that if an imputation as to hypocrisy is available
a query could
arise as to whether there would be a difference in substance from imputation
(a) which is not the subject of dispute.
 Assuming for the moment that an
imputation of hypocrisy is available I would not be inclined to strike it out
by reason of it not
differing in substance from imputation (a).  Imputation (a)
refers to non-disclosure.  Hypocrisy might, as a generally understood
word,
connote some element of deceit but essentially it involves what in lay terms
can be described as the "<i>preaching"</i> of one thing and the "<i>practising"
</i>of another.
<P>

11   	The Macquarie Dictionary defines hypocrisy as "<i>the act
of pretending to have a character or beliefs, principles, etc., that one does
not possess</i>".  That is of course a good dictionary definition.  But as was
argued for the plaintiff the ordinary reasonable listener can engage
in what is
described as "<i>loose thinking"</i> or "<i>reading between the lines</i>" (or
its equivalent in respect to a radio broadcast), and rationally come to the
view, and reasonably so, that there are qualities
to the person about whom the
publication is made to which that ordinary reasonable listener could fairly
apply the words "<i>hypocrite" </i>or "<i>hypocrisy'</i>.  After consideration
I am of the view that an imputation, but one in proper form, of hypocrisy is
capable of being conveyed.  The
essence of it is that Mr Lawson suggests that
Mr Hadley spends money like the twenty eight odd thousand other people who have
to
spend money (being non-members) to go to the cricket ground and see what the
real situation is; whereas Mr Lawson knows the real
situation but not from that
point of view, but from the luxury of being a member either of the media or of
the Sydney Cricket Ground
Trust.  There is sufficient there for a properly
drawn imputation to be found to be capable of being conveyed.
<P>

12   	Prior to the drafting of any amendments consequent upon
the leave I propose to grant, no doubt the plaintiff's advisers should
avail
themselves by access to the tape provided to me which will be marked as Exhibit
A and kept with the Court file (if they have
not already heard it).
<P>

13   	The defendant has predominantly succeeded in this
application.
<P>

14   	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	The matter complained of is incapable as a matter of law of conveying
imputations (c) and (e).
<P>

2.	The plaintiff has leave to file an Amended Statement of Claim to replead an
imputation in substitution for imputation (c) and
to plead an imputation in
proper form as to hypocrisy in substitution for imputation (b).
<P>

3.	Imputation (b) is struck out as bad in form.
<P>

4.	The plaintiff is pay the defendant's costs.
<P>

5.	The plaintiff is to file any Amended Statement of Claim within 21 days of
the date hereof.
<P>

6.	Upon the expiry of 21 days the matter may be re-listed in the Defamation
List on 7 days notice.
<P>


<P>

<center><b>Appendix</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1.	Yesterday we fielded quite a few calls from
<P>

2.	disgruntled cricket fans concerning the many
<P>

3.	problems attached to attending matches at the SCG.
<P>

4.	The one saving grace, of course, was the high
<P>

5.	standard of the cricket that we've seen at the SCG
<P>

6.	over the first three days.
<P>

7.	In brief, if you missed it, I questioned the ability of 
<P>

8.	the Sydney Cricket Ground to handle a capacity
<P>

9.	crowd of 40,000 plus.  I also questioned whether a
<P>

10.	city of five million people, like Sydney, deserved a
<P>

11.	cricket ground capable of holding more than 42 or
<P>

12.	43 thousand people.
<P>

13.	I suggested at some time in the future the Olympic
<P>

14.	Stadium may in fact be used for cricket matches.
<P>

15.	That stadium will be used as both a rugby league
<P>

16.	and AFL ground and the shape can be changed by
<P>

17.	moving part of the seating.  If it can be used for
<P>

18.	AFL well it can certainly be used for cricket.
<P>

19.	It opens, as I said yesterday, and I repeat today, in
<P>

20.	March, just two months from now.  The first
<P>

21.	sporting event will be the opening of the national
<P>

22.	rugby league season, first weekend in March.
<P>

23.	You know it would be wonderful to think that more
<P>

24.	than 28,000 paying customers could actually see a
<P>

25.	test match or a one dayer in Sydney.  With members
<P>

26.	taken into account that's roughly the number of 
<P>

27.	non-members who can actually attend a game.
<P>

28.	Somewhere between 28 and 30 thousand.
<P>

29.	I was advised, after I came off air yesterday, that I
<P>

30.	was on the receiving end of quite a vitriolic attack
<P>

31.	on ABC radio via the former cricketer, Geoffrey
<P>

32.	Lawson. I don't know Geoffrey Lawson, I've met
<P>

33.	him but I don't physically know him, I've said hello
<P>

34.	to him and exchanged pleasantries but I don't know 
<P>

35.	the man.
<P>

36.	I was accused by Geoffrey of not getting my facts
<P>

37.	right.  He apparently doesn't think there was a 
<P>

38.	problem at the SCG on Saturday when the house
<P>

39.	full sign went up.
<P>

40.	His attack was quite personal - listen to what he had
<P>

41.	to say, this morning.  I noticed in defending the 
<P>

42.	SCG as a venue he's neglected to mention he's
<P>

43.	actually a member of the Sydney Cricket Ground 
<P>

44.	Trust.  Surely a relevant piece of information when
<P>

45.	he's talking objectively about an issue in which he
<P>

46.	has a vested interest.
<P>

47.	You see, people would be fully understanding of his 
<P>

48.	blind loyalty if he prefaced his attack on me with
<P>

49.	the qualification he was speaking not with his
<P>

50.	objective ABC commentary hat on but rather his
<P>

51.	subjective Trust hat around his head.
<P>

52.	I stand by what I said, the SCG does struggle to 
<P>

53.	handle a capacity crowd.  And I repeat, in a city of
<P>

54.	five million it's disgraceful that not more than
<P>

55.	28,000 non-members can actually see to get (sic) a 
<P>

56.	magnificent sporting event.
<P>

57.	It's also sad that when many of the members turn up
<P>

58.	in such circumstances as presented themselves on 
<P>

59.	Saturday they can't be comfortably catered for
<P>

60.	either.
<P>

61.	Now, Geoffrey Lawson suggests I should spend 
<P>

62.	some of my money and go to the cricket. That's
<P>

63.	strange from someone who when he's not working
<P>

64.	for the ABC would either be in the comfortable
<P>

65.	media area or the air conditioned lounge set aside
<P>

66.	for trustees like Mr Lawson.
<P>

67.	Now, because I don't know Geoffrey Lawson, last
<P>

68.	night I sought out some of his former team mates
<P>

69.	and colleagues and I found it difficult to actually get
<P>

70.	a rap for him.
<P>

71.	One suggested if Geoffrey won lotto he'd be dirty if
<P>

72.	he had to go and pick up the money.  Another
<P>

73.	described Geoffrey as a finely balanced man with a 
<P>

74.	chip on both shoulders.  And of course, in recent
<P>

75.	time he's had little to be happy about, Geoffrey
<P>

76.	Lawson, he was sacked as coach of the New South
<P>

77.	Wales Cricket side two years back.  It appears he
<P>

78.	had a communication problem with the players and
<P>

79.	administrators.
<P>

80.	But further research finds me feeling actually sorry
<P>

81.	for Geoffrey Lawson.  I'm told reliably his problems
<P>

82.	relate to a medical condition dating back to his
<P>

83.	teens.  It seems Geoffrey, at some stage in his
<P>

84.	formative years, had serious surgery.  Both
<P>

85.	procedures, a charisma and personality by-pass
<P>

86.	were successful.
<P>

87.	I'll continue to enjoy the ABC commentary led so
<P>

88.	ably by my friend and colleague Tim Lane along
<P>

89.	with the likes of Jim Maxwell, Dean Jones, Peter
<P>

90.	Roebuck, when Mr Charisma By-pass starts
<P>

91.	broadcasting I'll reach for the on-off switch.
<P>

92.	Of course, he has the luxury of having the same type
<P>

93.	of switch, I hope, on his transistor.
