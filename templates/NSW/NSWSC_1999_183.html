<b><u>JUDGMENT</u>  -  Re  Liability</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:		</b>After a trial which has lasted for some two and a half
weeks where literally dozens of exhibits have been tendered, where there have
been numerous lay witnesses, where there have been many exhibits, something in
the order of five or six expert witnesses, there is
also six hundred odd pages
of transcript to consider in relation  to this matter, I am in a position to
give judgment.
<P>

2	Despite what I have said, I have come to a firm conclusion in relation to
that matter.  I do not consider there is any benefit
to be derived from
reserving judgment in the circumstances.  I say that because during the course
of the case I have read and re-read
the evidence as it is been produced. I also
say it because I have had the benefit of extensive written submissions on
behalf of the
parties and extensive oral submissions also made on behalf of the
various parties.
<P>

3	The infant plaintiff's action, being an action by Simon Madigan, has been
heard at the same time as two actions for nervous shock
brought by his parents,
Michael and Suzanne Madigan.
<P>

4	Their actions  for nervous shock arise from the circumstances giving rise to
the plaintiff's own action.  It was earlier agreed
that the actions should be
heard together, with the evidence in the one case to be evidence in the other
two cases.  A number of
agreements have been very helpfully reached as between
the parties.  I commend them for the course that they have adopted in respect
of the agreements that I am about to announce.
<P>

5	First as and between the plaintiff and the first and second defendants, in
relation  to the claim of the infant, Simon Madigan,
there is agreement upon
quantum of damages pursuant to the  <b><u>Motor Accidents Act 1998
(NSW)</u></b>.
<P>

6	In relation to the claim by Simon Madigan as and against the third defendant,
there is agreement that if damages are to be assessed
pursuant to the
<b><u>Motor Accidents Act</u></b>,  the parties are agreed as to that figure
being the same figure as agreed  between the infant plaintiff and the first and
second
defendants.  It is also agreed between the infant plaintiff and the
third defendant, that if the infant plaintiff's damages are to
be assessed
other than under the  <b><u>Motor Accidents Act</u></b>,  that is at common
law, then it is agreed, that in respect to the agreed figure under the
<b><u>Motor Accidents Act</u></b>  in the assessment, no regard shall be had to
that figure so agreed under the  <b><u>Motor Accidents Act</u></b>.
<P>

7	In relation  to the nervous shock claims brought by each of the parents,
Michael and Suzanne Madigan, there is an agreement as
to quantum with all
defendants agreeing the only issue to be resolved is that of negligence
generally.  There is no issue as to whether
nervous shock has occurred and it
is agreed between all parties that contributory negligence on the part of the
infant plaintiff
in his own action is no defence to the parents' action for
nervous shock.
<P>

8	Next, it is accepted as and between the parties that in the proceedings
contributory negligence may be varied according to which
of the defendants, one
or all of them, may be found to be liable.  Indeed contribution questions are
at large.
<P>

9	Mr Neil QC made a statement to the effect that his client's liability in
respect to damages and contribution, the first and second
defendant, being the
owner and driver of the vehicle involved in the accident should be capped by
the agreements that were announced
and to which I have just referred to.  He
also submitted that the first and second defendant would not be liable for any
further
moneys on contribution, if any.  He also submitted that if the third
defendant and the first and second plaintiffs were not able
to reach an
agreement, then it might, depending upon certain matters, be necessary for him
to address on further rulings in relation
to the matters of the damages and
contribution.
<P>

10	This is indeed a tragic case.  It is a case of a young boy almost aged
twelve who was involved in a motorcar accident on Saturday,
26 November 1994.
He sustained most serious injures including head injuries with grave and
serious consequences.  One consequence
should be mentioned.  It is accepted
between the parties that the plaintiff, by reason of the gravity of his head
injuries, is, and
has been, unable to give evidence touching upon the issue of
liability.  It has not been suggested otherwise.  The Court has been
denied the
assistance that might have been forthcoming from the infant plaintiff had he
been able to give his version of what took
place preceding the receipt of his
gross injuries on 26 November 1994.  Fortunately from his point of view, the
plaintiff's case
is not dependent upon  what he might have been able to say in
respect of the circumstances that preceded the accident.
<P>

11	There has been lay evidence that has been given by two other young lads who
accompanied him on the bike ride that led to his
accident.  There is other
evidence from lay and expert people that has also been given.  There are
inferences to be  drawn from the
evidence.  All of these things are available
to me as aids to determine the matter of liability.
<P>

12	I also add an additional remark at this stage.  The extensive number of
witnesses who have been called have sought to provide
help to me in resolving
some of the difficult issues of the facts and law that arise in the instant
case.  In reaching a conclusion
in this particular matter, it is appropriate
for me to say that many of the witnesses did not merely have a fleeting visit
to the
witness box, but to say the least, spent considerable periods of time in
the witness box being cross-examined and tested by respective
senior counsel
appearing for each of the three parties.  The point to be here made is that in
the circumstances of this case, because
the appearance of many witnesses has
not been of a fleeting nature in the witness box, but has involved appearing
for some considerable
period of time and being subject to extensive
cross-examination, that such has conferred upon me as the trial judge a
particular
benefit and that is the opportunity to make accurate assessments in
my own mind of the reliability and credibility of such witnesses.
 I have seen
them and I have heard them and I consider these advantages of very considerable
significance in a case of this nature.
 The advantages of seeing and hearing
witnesses also extends to the defendant motorist involved in the accident.  It
extends as well
to the various experts who have been called to give evidence by
and on behalf of the various parties.  I have been able to assess
their
reliability and credibility including their reliability and credibility when
they have been the subject of extensive cross-examination.
 As I have said, I
have read and re-read the transcript.  These matters also represent background
matters as to why I believe that
I am in a position to give this judgment
immediately.
<P>

13	The infant plaintiff (date of birth 31 March 1983 and aged eleven years and
eight months at the time of his accident) sustained
various injuries when a
pedal cycle he was riding north in Kudilla Street, North Engadine, came into
collision with a van driven
by a driver by the name of Gregory Hughes and owned
by his employer, the second defendant.  The accident occurred at or about
4.40pm
on 26 November 1994 at the T intersection of Thurlgona Road and Kudilla
Street, Engadine.
<P>

14	The plaintiff's case is that upon entering Thurlgona Road at the
intersection or near the intersection of Thurlgona Road and
Kudilla Street, he
was struck by a van driven by the first defendant.  The plaintiff originally
commenced his action against the
owner and driver of the van including alleging
negligence in a number of respects, particularly in driving at a speed
excessive in
the circumstances, failing to keep a proper lookout and failure to
maintain proper control over the van so as to avoid the accident
with the
infant plaintiff at the intersection.
<P>

15	It appears that following the issue of cross-claim proceedings by the first
and second defendants against the third defendant,
a road authority being the
Sutherland Shire Council, the plaintiff amended his statement of claim to add
the council as a third defendant.
 Having regard to the way the plaintiff
ultimately prosecuted his case and the evidence that he actually led in his
case, and putting
to one side for the moment a reliance upon the evidence led
in the case advanced on behalf of the driver and Council; one is left
with a
very distinct impression that absent the cross-claim the plaintiff would have
been essentially content to prosecute his case
only against the defendant owner
and driver of the vehicle.
<P>

16	That said, the case advanced in the amended statement of claim against the
Sutherland Shire Council, as is reflected in the cross-claim
by the first and
second defendants, involves an assertion of misfeasance in relation to
negligence in connection with an area of
roadway near or about the entrance of
Kudilla Street and Thurlgona Road Engadine, and more particularly an area of
roadway allegedly
constituted by a sagging of a trench sewer which extended
approximately 8.5 metres in an east/west direction in Kudilla Street and
just
to the south of a concrete dish drain extending also east and west at the
entrance of Kudilla Street and Thurlgona Road.
<P>

17	It was accepted by the parties that the law in respect of the third
defendant's liability if any for misfeasance is as stated
in  <b><u>Hill v The
Commissioner for Main Roads</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20Aust%20Torts%20Reports%2080%2d260" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) Aust Torts Reports 80-260.</a>  This
case has been applied in a number of cases since then.
<P>

18	The plaintiff's case against the third defendant Council may be stated as
follows.  Kudilla Street and Thurlgona Road were public
roads, with the third
defendant being under the relevant legislation also the owner of the road.  The
claim is made that immediately
before colliding with the van driven by the
first defendant, the plaintiff rode his bicycle into a particular area of the
road near
the intersection of Kudilla Street and Thurlgona Road.  This area
more particularly may be described as being a sagged area constituted
by the
installation in the 1970's of a sewer line trench which in turn thereby created
a sag in the road near the intersection of
Kudilla Street and Thurlgona Road,
indeed not merely a sag but also a depression at the south eastern corner of
the intersection.
 The sag, it was said, was a sag that extended across Kudilla
Street just to the south of the concrete dish drain and which was approximately
some one thousand seven hundred and fifty millimetres wide and which was about
five hundred and fifty millimetres in width.  
<P>

19	The particular part of the depression, it was said, was near the south
eastern corner of the intersection.  Further, and in addition,
it was alleged
that near or about what has been referred to as the south eastern corner near
or about the sewer line trench depression
and sag in that south eastern corner
was located a pot hole.  This pot hole, it was alleged, was one in the pavement
at the east
side of Kudilla Street at the intersection with Thurlgona Road
having dimensions of three hundred millimetres in diameter and described
as
being some twenty five millimetres deep adjacent with its nearest point some
eighty millimetres from the concrete gutter of the
south eastern corner of some
eighty millimetres
<P>

20	However, a significant issue in the case was whether the bike ridden by the
cyclist at any or some time in fact passed over the
sag and/or depression
and/or pot hole in the vicinity of the south eastern corner of the
intersection.
<P>

21	Evidence was given that in respect of this pot hole that there was, as and
between an imaginary centre line in Kudilla Street,
and the western edge of the
pot hole, a distance of 3.6 metres of trafficable area. 
<P>

22	The case that is mounted by the plaintiff as and against the Council and
which is also a reflection of the driver's case as and
against the Council, is
to the effect that the plaintiff came into contact with the sag and/or
depression and/or pot hole in about
the vicinity of the south eastern corner of
the intersection as the plaintiff proceeded down the street into Thurlgona Road
and that
somehow or other the contact with those areas and, particularly, the
pot hole area, caused a wobbling in the bike which in turn caused
or
contributed to the plaintiff's accident.  That accident or impact occurred in
Thurlgona Road which I will detail in due course.
<P>

23	Indeed, it is particularly alleged by the first and second defendants that
the plaintiff allegedly cut that corner as he proceeded
into Thurlgona Road
which contained in the area, a depression, sagging or pot hole which, it is
said, caused or contributed to the
plaintiff developing a wobble in his bicycle
as he drove through the area.  This it is said caused subsequent loss of
control which
in turn caused the bike to veer into the path of the first
defendant's motor vehicle.
<P>

24	The issues joined between the plaintiff and the third defendant Council and
between the first and second defendants and the third
defendant Council involve
issues of misfeasance.  However, it is common ground, having regard to the way
the case has been conducted
that, if the plaintiff was not cutting the corner
as he proceeded north east, ie cutting the south east corner of the
intersection,
but was rather on his correct side of the road as he proceeded
down Kudilla Street before turning into Thurlgona Road then the question
of the
accident being caused or contributed to by the presence of the sewer line
trench, sag, depression and/or pot hole in the vicinity
of the south eastern
corner really disappears and such presence really has no role to play.
<P>

25	It is appropriate if I just make some other observations in respect of this
sagging or depression or pot hole particularly in
the region of the south
eastern corner of the intersection.  It would appear that Kudilla Street was
constructed sometime in the
1970's.  A sewer line trench was installed in an
easterly and westerly direction and measuring about eight point five metres
just
south of a concrete dish drain near the intersection of Kudilla Street and
Thurlgona Road.  The evidence would suggest that the sewer
line trench and the
back fill at the time was installed by the Water Board and that the works of
back fill were done also by the
Water Board.  That seems to be an irresistible
inference on the evidence and it is not disputed that it is open for me to make
that
finding.  The evidence would also suggest that following the installation
of the sewer line trench that there was a back fill done
which was by way of
temporary reinstatement, such temporary reinstatement work being again done by
the Water Board. 
<P>

26	Within six months or so of that temporary reinstatement it would appear that
the Council, ie the third defendant, completed or
more accurately participated
in, what was called a permanent reinstatement of that sewer line trench works.
It is also clear that
any subsequent repairs to the trench line were carried
out and conducted by the third defendant Sutherland Council. 
<P>

27	An issue has arisen as to whether, following the reinstatement of a
permanent nature in the 1970's by the Council, there was
or has been more than
one other repair.
<P>

28	Sutherland Council has contended that there was only one repair to the sewer
line trench works and the sag area allegedly caused
by the original sewer line
works in or about 1989.  Mr Clark, an expert gave that evidence. 
<P>

29	Dr Yeaman, an expert who was called on behalf of the driver and owner of the
vehicle, gave evidence that he thought that there
had been more than one repair
subsequent to the permanent reinstatement.  He thought there may in fact have
been two or three repairs
with the last one being in or about 1989. 
<P>

30	It is not necessary for me to resolve this somewhat interesting dispute nor
is it necessary for me to resolve any questions as
to the number of repairs, or
whether or not there had been any misfeasance on the part of the Council or
further, whether or not
even assuming there was a breach of duty on the part of
the council, whether such breach of duty caused or contributed to the subject
accident.  I say this because I have reached a firm conclusion that as the boy
turned into Thurlgona Road from Kudilla Street, that
he did not cut the corner
when he was proceeding in an easterly direction or to put it another way, did
not cut the south eastern
corner of the intersection as it has been referred
to.
<P>

31	Thus it seems to me, and again having regard to the way the case has been
conducted, that such a finding would therefore remove
the existence or
otherwise of a pot hole or sag or, alternatively, a depression in the south
east corner of the intersection as having
been a factor in the terms of the
accident, or, even in terms of producing what is said to have been a wobble in
the bicycle that
was allegedly observed as it entered the intersection.
<P>

32	Once I make the finding as I do, that the plaintiff did not cross the area
represented by the sagging depression or pot hole
in or about the vicinity of
the south eastern corner of the intersection, and it also appears to me, or
further or alternatively,
that the vehicle impact did not occur further to the
east of the Thurlgona Road, then those findings would also lead to the
conclusion
that whether or not there was a breach of duty in relation to the
surface of the south eastern corner of the intersection, that such
had nothing
to do with the accident.  In my view having regard to where and the way the
accident occurred which I will describe more
fully in a moment.  The accident
had nothing to do with the surface or condition of the road in the south
eastern corner.  Thus,
it seems to me that having regard to the way this case
has been conducted, that the infant plaintiff's action as and against the
third
defendant must fail and the first and second defendants' cross-claim as against
the council must also fail.
<P>

33	Before dealing with the question of the point of the impact and indeed what
occurred on the day in question, it is appropriate
for me to mention several
other things.  I also note however at this moment in time that there has been
an allegation of contributory
negligence on the part of the plaintiff, an
allegation or allegations made about the first and second defendants as well by
the third
defendant.  It will be necessary to return to this subject of
contributory negligence before I conclude my remarks and reasons for
judgment.
<P>

34	Let me turn now to the accident's location.  I state that the weather at the
time of the accident was reported as being fine,
the road surface as asphalt
and dry.  According to the police report, the traffic in Thurlgona Road was
described as light.  The
view was open. The P4 report tendered described
Thurlgona Road as a main road.  For the purposes of understanding the case, the
way
the litigation has been conducted and the evidence, it is appropriate if I
immediately draw attention to the fact that the trial
has been conducted and
the witnesses have given their evidence by reference to the compass points to
be found in exhibit A tendered
in the proceedings.
<P>

35	The facts and circumstances surrounding the occurrence are in dispute.  The
lay evidence and the expert evidence are in dispute.
 What preceded the
accident is in dispute, the point of impact described by one expert witness as
the point of impact is very much
in dispute.  What happened and why it came
about is something about which the infant plaintiff was unable to give
evidence.
<P>

36	It has been accepted by the parties that I am entitled to, as any tribunal
of fact whether it be judge or jury, to accept part
of a witness' evidence and
reject part of a witness' evidence.  A matter that also gives rise to serious
concern, is the matter of
evaluating the credibility and reliability
particularly of a number of lay witnesses called in the defendants' case and
who, did
endeavour to the best of their abilities, to properly give evidence
according to their recollection of events.  I mention some of
their names, Mr
Murtagh, Mrs Woolley, the latter who was first interviewed about the event in
1996 but apparently first interviewed
on investigation by the first and second
defendants around about the end of the April 1997.  Other witnesses also
include Mr Zammit
and Mr Cope.  I have given full weight to their views but
also borne in mind that with the exception of Mrs Woolley, those persons
whose
names I have just referred to did not appear to have become involved in the
cases until 1997, up to two and a half years after
the accident.  They do not
appear to have come forward to speak to the police officer who was
investigating the circumstances of
the accident.
<P>

37	I mean no disrespect to such persons referred to, or indeed to any of them
if I say that I believe that in the circumstances
of this case, that it is
proper that I should act upon the recollections of the two young bike riders or
two young children who were
accompanying the plaintiff on a bike ride that
preceded the subsequent occurrence.  In fact I feel, subject to some
qualifications,
that I can safely act on the views of the plaintiff's young
brother, Adam Madigan, and again, subject to some qualifications, the
views of
the plaintiff's young friend, a young man by the name of Rhys Baldwin.  They
were two persons who were riding by cycles
with the plaintiff at the scene.
What occurred to this young plaintiff must have been quite a horrific
experience for each of the
two boys.  Where there is conflict between what the
boys recalled at the time of the accident in terms of what generally took
place,
subject to some qualifications, and what the lay witnesses could recall
perhaps some two and a half years later or in the case of
Mrs Woolley perhaps
one and a half years, it is appropriate for me to say, that having seen and
heard the young boys, I accept their
evidence where it is in conflict with the
recollections of adult individuals, one or all of them seeking to recall events
some two
and a half years after the event and, perhaps, in the case of Mrs
Woolley, one and a half years after the event.
<P>

38	It is appropriate for me to state that an additional reason for generally
again accepting the two boy's evidence subject to some
qualification, is that
their evidence as to point of impact in terms of the point of impact between
the vehicle and the bike does
generally coincide in a general sense with what I
regard as being admissions by the defendant, Mr Hughes, to the police officer
as
reflected in diagrams and drawings in the P4 report, as well as to those
referred to in his later "reports" to Lumleys, the vehicle
insurer, and to CIC
insurance company.  This generally contemporaneous material provides generally
support for the point of impact
as described by the two young boys rather than
the point of impact sought to be advanced by the defendant driver as well as by
two
of the lay witnesses called on his behalf, in particular Mrs Woolley and Mr
Cope. 
<P>

39	Indeed, there is another reason why one would generally accept the two boys:
they appeared to me to be intelligent boys, not
coached in any way.  They were
cross examined extensively.  They are the sort of young boys who, generally
speaking, whose evidence
I can rely upon. 
<P>

40	In addition, there is not only Mr Hughes providing information as to the
point of impact to the police, CIC and to Lumleys, but,
I also have regard to
the fact that there is evidence from a Constable Pearson touching upon the
point of impact unrelated to a drawing
that was provided for the P4 purposes by
Mr Hughes.
<P>

41	The police officer who attended the scene, Constable Pearson, appeared to be
an impressive police officer who did her best not
merely to collect information
as to what occurred and what happened but also sought to identify where the
point of impact was which
she then gave in her evidence.  Now, that particular
point of impact was not based merely upon what the defendant Mr Hughes told
her.  She identified debris on the road which assisted her in identifying the
point of impact in Thurlgona Road.  She thought that
the materials came from
the bike and vehicle involved in the subject occurrence.  I feel that in the
circumstances of this case I
can also quite confidently act on the generally
contemporaneous material, the drawings of the point of impact which allowing
for
some variables, are not of any significance in terms in determining and
deciding where this accident occurred.  I believe that the
point of impact can
be identified, not merely in terms of an east west situation, but also in terms
of a north south situation in
Thurlgona Road.  The precise point I will come
back to in a moment.
<P>

42	One other matter that I feel it is appropriate for me to make an observation
about is that the defendant driver, Mr Hughes, gave
evidence before me.  I am
prepared to accept that he was shaken up after the accident and when he spoke
to the police.  The accident
must have been a dreadful experience for him and I
make due allowance for that matter as well.  That said, I am bound to express
the view that I regarded Mr Hughes as being an unsatisfactory and unreliable
witness.  Unsatisfactory and unreliable in several respects:
first of all, the
evidence that he gave as to the point of impact is not evidence that I can
accept.  Indeed, I do not accept it
because it conflicts with my view as to
where the point of impact occurred in Thurlgona Road.
<P>

43	Further, there are a number of inconsistencies in the accounts that were
given by Mr Hughes in relation to what occurred both
prior to and subsequent to
his sighting the plaintiff and prior to the impact with him.  After he observed
the boy coming out of
Thurlgona Road, Mr Hughes gave a description of the boy's
conduct and behaviour on the bike prior to the point of impact which he
put as
being further east of the intersection in Thurlgona Road.  Next, in respect of
the particular type of conduct on the part
of the plaintiff before impact, what
he claimed he observed him to do in a number of respects it just could not have
happened in
the way that he described.  Indeed, so much appears to have been
accepted by the defendants' experts Mr Griffiths and Mr George.
 There is no
need to mention the respects that I have just referred to.
<P>

44	Next, it appears that apart from the defendant giving different versions of
a number of matters to different people I just find
it impossible to accept his
claim (at p 136) that when he first saw the plaintiff coming out of Kudilla
Street that the  plaintiff
was virtually heading east, that he was cutting the
corner and that he was heading north east. 
<P>

45	The defendants' case has been advanced upon the basis that that is what
happened, that the plaintiff had cut the corner, the
south eastern corner of
the intersection, and was involved in an impact on the defendant driver's
incorrect side of the road in Thurlgona
Road and further east of the
intersection than where I consider the impact to have occurred.  Indeed, the
finding as to the point
of impact is significant.  In my view the point of
impact between the defendant driver and, indeed, the rider was not only on the
defendant driver's incorrect side of Thurlgona Road but also in what has been
described by Mr Gross QC for the plaintiff as the "throat
of the intersection".
The point of impact may in my view be seen not merely in the diagrams and in
the P4 form as well as in the
Lumley and CIC claim forms but can be more
accurately understood as having occurred in the throat of the intersection as
illustrated
in a document produced by Mr Griffiths being exhibit 26.
<P>

46	I consider and find that the impact occurred in the throat of the
intersection and did not occur, as has been suggested, perhaps
seven and a half
metres or so further to the east in Thurlgona Road as has been contended for by
the driver and his legal representatives.
 I will come back to this matter in
due course.
<P>

47	I now turn to another aspect of the matter.  At the time of the accident the
bike was being ridden by the plaintiff.  He was
almost aged twelve and was an
experienced bike rider.  His father and other siblings were likewise
experienced, a matter that I will
return to later.  The bike he was riding was
a Repco brand BMX bike that was almost regarded as being a reserve bike that
was kept
in the home and which he had ridden earlier in his life time.  The
plaintiff had owned his own bike for two years.  He had ridden
his sister's
bike before then.
<P>

48	Thus in my opinion the plaintiff, albeit aged twelve was an experienced bike
rider and had sufficient knowledge and tuition to
ride on the road and
understood the complexities of bike riding and rules of riding upon the
roads.
<P>

49	One issue that can be immediately put to one side right here and now
concerns the matter of what has been said to be a missing
brake pad from the
front wheel of the bike.  Having regard to the nature of the impact and
circumstances of the accident, I find
as a fact that the pad was probably lost
or dislodged in the accident and was caused by such.  I reject any argument
that it was
missing before the impact.  I reject any argument that it was
defective, and somehow or other caused or contributed to the subject
accident.
<P>

50	At the time of the accident the plaintiff was wearing an approved Rosebank
stack hat, yellow in colour.  It was designed for
wear for bike riders.  He
also appears to have been wearing light clothes.
<P>

51	Let me now come to the environment in which this accident occurred.
Thurlgona Road is a local street which for the purposes of
this trial has been
described as travelling generally in an east west direction.  As I said, the
trial was conducted upon the basis
that the compass points were those as
reflected in exhibit A with evidence being given by reference to those compass
points.  The
area consisted of low density family homes populated by persons of
all ages from children to adults.  It was an urban area with a
permissible
lawful urban speed limit of sixty kilometres per hour.  It was not sign
posted.
<P>

52	Thurlgona Road is a local road also, as I have said, extending through low
density residential land.  It is the top of the T,
or, to put it another way,
Thurlgona Road represents the top of the T where it intersects with Kudilla
Street which runs in a north
south direction.  Kudilla Street links Corriengah
Heights Road with Thurlgona Road.  Kudilla Street is a street which may be
described
as a fairly steep slope descending to Thurlgona Road where the top of
the descent is at the intersection of Kudilla Street and Corriengah
Heights
Road.  In respect of Thurlgona Road to the east of the intersection with
Kudilla Street, there is an incline to the east.
 A driver driving along
Thurlgona Road approaching Kudilla Street intersection from the east, proceeds
up a gradual incline.
<P>

53	In the vicinity of the accident location, Thurlgona Road consisted of a full
width asphalt pavement between concrete gutters.
 The pavement was about 8.5
metres wide between kerbs.  It is suggested that the maximum grade in Kudilla
Street was 12.5 percent.
 Mr Wingrove, another expert, suggested it had a
fairly steep 13 percent downgrade as it approached the intersection.  The
appearance
from the photographs tendered, suggested that on any view, Kudilla
Street did have a steep  down hill grade.
<P>

54	Evidence was given that Thurlgona Street ran moderately uphill of the
intersection, described at about a 6 percent grade for
travel along the van's
path towards the intersection.  At the time of the accident Mr Hughes was
driving west in Thurlgona Road.
<P>

55	I am satisfied that the plaintiff had entered the intersection having
travelled down hill in Kudilla Street in a northerly direction
towards the
intersection.  I am satisfied and I accept the two young boys' evidence that on
the day in question the journey down
hill or the journey that preceded the
accident commenced halfway up the hill.  Some evidence was given that Kudilla
Street was not
only a street with a steep down hill but also was a street some
eighty metres or so in length.  I have already mentioned that at
or about the
threshold of Kudilla Street with Thurlgona Road a concrete spoon drain crosses
the road from east to west to prevent
rainfall run off flowing down Kudilla
Street from continuing across Thurlgona Road.  The concrete dish drain or spoon
drain was about
forty millimetres in depth.
<P>

56	Let me also make some further observations about the accident location.
Thurlgona Road was a road running east and west in an
urban area.  In that area
lived a spectrum of persons in age ranging from the young to the old.  Families
lived in the area.  So
much appears not to be in dispute.  Of significance is
that in Thurlgona Road and the vicinity of the accident there are no footpaths
on the northern or southern sides.  There are grass nature strips interrupted
from time to time by concrete driveways giving access
from Thurlgona Road to
the houses behind the nature strips.  Again similarly there are nature strips
in Kudilla Street interrupted
by concrete driveways giving access to people in
Kudilla Street.  Three large trees were located on the south eastern side of
Thurlgona
Road in the front of the premises number 74.  They substantially
concealed approaching views to Kudilla Street for a car approaching
or
proceeding uphill or along Thurlgona Road and travelling from east to west
towards the intersection.  There were also trees in
the premises number 74.  At
the time of the subject accident around the corner in Kudilla Street there was
a concrete drive giving
access to number 74.  There was a car parked in that
concrete drive at the time of the accident.
<P>

57	I am satisfied that the trees in the vicinity substantially interrupted
visual observations for a driver proceeding west in Thurlgona
Road as he
approached the intersection to Kudilla Street. Trees may thus have influenced
the driver's ability to observe or maintain
continuous observation of a bike
rider coming down Kudilla Street.  I am satisfied that the trees and, perhaps,
the car parked in
number 74 would interfere with the driver's visibility of
users of Kudilla Street.  The point to be made in my referring at some
length
to the vegetation and trees is that a driver proceeding along Thurlgona Road in
a westerly direction would know as he/she
approached Kudilla Street that his
view would be obscured in part by the vegetation.
<P>

58	I have already described the area of works in the vicinity of the south
eastern corner of the intersection.  I have described
the trench, I have
described the sewer trench, the sag depression, the pot hole and I have said,
in my view were not involved in
the accident and which had nothing to do with
it or any wobbling, if any, of the bike that may have been seen by anyone.  I
do not
propose to return to that particular subject, there is no need to do
so.
<P>

59	I now turn to another matter in relation to the area in which this accident
occurred.  In doing so it is appropriate to remember
that whatever may have
been the lawful speed limit under the ordinary motor traffic speed laws
applicable in the area that does not
necessarily mean that because there is a
lawful speed limit, that such limit necessarily is the appropriate or
reasonable one in
all circumstances, at all times and at all places in or near
the accident location.  I have already referred to the obscuring of
the view to
Kudilla Street for a driver approaching from the east proceeding in a westerly
direction and obstruction caused to vision
by the trees.  A prudent reasonable
driver would know as he approached the intersection that there was an
obstruction to his visibility
and the need to be conscious of such.
<P>

60	Also there was evidence given by a Sergeant Crumblin that there was a park
in the vicinity of Thurlgona Road some fifty metres
or so to the west of the
intersection.  It was this park, I am satisfied, that the three boys used after
they commenced their bike
ride from the St John Bosco School to the accident
location.  I am satisfied that the school was about three kilometres from the
accident location.  I am satisfied that if the boys had not stopped for a while
in this park, as I believe they did, then the time
taken to reach to the
intersection of Kudilla Street and Thurlgona Road after proceeding along
Thurlgona Road to the intersection
would have been perhaps in the order of
fifteen minutes or so. 
<P>

61	The defendant, gave evidence as to his state of knowledge of the area.  He
accepted and admitted in cross examination that he
had lived in the area for
some twelve months, and that he was aware that there was a nature strip along
Thurlgona Road comprising
grass with provision being made for driveway aprons
on to the road.  He said that he was alert to the risk of children coming onto
the road.  He accepted it would be difficult for children riding push bikes to
ride those bikes on the grass verges, that they would
have to use the road to
travel along.  He accepted, so he said, that bike riders would be able to use
Kudilla Street as well. 
<P>

62	Thus it seems to me that these matters which I have referred to are also
relevant to what was required by the exercise of reasonable
care, indeed, what
was demanded by the exercise of reasonable care at the location on that
Saturday afternoon at or about 4.40pm.
 In other words, matters concerning the
general nature of the location are, it seems to me, relevant to the issue of
the exercise
of reasonable care.  What will satisfy that duty of care will
depend on the circumstances prevailing at the time of the accident.

<P>

63	It is appropriate for me to further say something about the matter of speed.
As I have said there was a permissible speed limit
in the area of sixty
kilometres per hour.  That does not mean that in all places at all times in the
area where sixty kilometres
per hour is permitted, or that because the speed
limit was 60 kilometres an hour, or that what reasonable care requires is
necessarily
fixed by reference to that speed limit.  Reasonable care is not
fixed by a mere compliance alone with the permissible speed limit
regulations,
any more than it is fixed solely by reference to a permissible speed limit that
may be of general operation in an urban
area.  (See for example  <b><u>Sibley
v  Kais</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1967/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1967] HCA 43</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281967%29%20118%20CLR%20424" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1967) 118 CLR 424</a>; see also  <b><u>Yu  v  Yu</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2026%20MVR%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996)
26 MVR 509.</a> 
<P>

64	Also having regard to the decision of the Court of Appeal in  <b><u>Stocks
&amp; Anor  v  Baldwin</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2024%20MVR%20416" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 24 MVR 416</a>, the common law duty is to
act reasonably in all circumstances even where there are regulations the duty
to act reasonably in all
the circumstances is paramount.  (cf also  <b><u>West
v  GIO</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 38</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20148%20CLR%2062" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 148 CLR 62</a> at 66).  It is to be remembered that in
questions of civil liability one is concerned with the obligation of each road
user to exercise
reasonable care for the other without regulations or speed
limits necessarily being definitive of those respective duties.
<P>

65	In the instant case I am satisfied that the driver was approaching the
intersection at the maximum optimum speed permitted by
the law.  He admits that
he approached the intersection from the east and that as he moved up the
incline he did so at 60 kilometres
per hour, and that he sought to maintain
that speed which he had been doing before he reached the incline.  That said a
question
arises as to whether the 60 kilometres per hour was a reasonably
appropriate speed in the accident location at the time and place
when and where
the accident took place.  Although it was the permissible legal speed, and the
maximum legal speed, in the circumstances
of this case having regard to the
location and the matters to which I have already made reference, I believe and
find that the speed
was excessive.  That is not to say in other areas in the
Engadine region the maximum legal speed may not have been reasonable at
different times or on a different occasions.  The decision in
<b><u>Stocks</u></b>  is relevant in terms of illustrating the significance of
speed in the context of motor car vehicle accidents even when the speed
is
permitted by law.  Next, speed is important because the faster one drives the
more difficult it may be to stop or the more difficult
it may be to pull up
suddenly if a foreseeable event takes place:  see also
<b><u>Stocks</u></b>.
<P>

66	The defendants' case, and I seek to summarise it, appears in Mr Neil's
written submissions. It seem to me that such case may
be summarised as follows.
The defendant was driving on his correct side of the road as he proceeded in a
westerly direction to the
intersection.  He came up an up hill grade at a speed
of approximately sixty kilometres per hour.  A short time before the accident
occurred he observed a person approaching the corner.  He claimed that the
person he saw was a boy on a bike who appeared to have
been racing away from
some friends, and that as when seen approaching the intersection he was
wobbling at or about that time.  The
boy on the bicycle was seen heading east
and was cutting the corner, so that in effect he was heading north east.
<P>

67	It is submitted on behalf of the defendant driver that just prior to the
corner the bike rider plaintiff lost control of his
bike.  Before the
collision, the vehicle driver braked lightly, turned his wheel to the right,
and veered to the right, and then
the accident occurred and collision took
place.
<P>

68	The driver's case generally was that at some point of time on Kudilla Street
the plaintiff's bicycle crossed on to the incorrect
side of Kudilla Street on
the path to the east of the centre of that street, travelling at a speed of
thirty kilometres per hour,
and that on reaching the pot hole it then veered
toward the south east corner of the intersection to cut the corner.  It was
claimed
that the plaintiff had headed into the area variously described as a
pot hole, depression or dip causing him to loose control and
the handle bar to
wobble.  The boy then veered to his left, and headed in an easterly direction
to the dish drain and collided with
the van.
<P>

69	As I have said, that is the driver's general case although an alternative
case has been postulated were I to find that the point
of impact was not as the
defendant driver claimed it to be namely as occurring to the east of the
intersection in Thurlgona Road.
 However, I do not accept that the driver's
case as to the point of impact as being further to the east of the
intersection.
<P>

70	I find that the point of impact was in what was called the T intersection.
I accept the evidence of the police officer as to
how far it was, about six
metres north from the southern boundary of Thurlgona Road, that after the
driver performed a veering action
to the right side of the drain.  I find that
the impact occurred on the vehicle driver's incorrect side of the road and in
what has
been described as in the throat of the intersection as indicated the
in exhibit 26.
<P>

71	I also accept the evidence that there was about nine metres of skid marks on
what might be regarded as being the northern side
or incorrect side of the
road, which skid marks were made by the defendant's vehicle.
<P>

72	Further, Mr Neil submitted that in the circumstances of this case, even were
I to reject the defendant's version of how  the
boy came into the intersection,
where he came into it, and even were I to reject the submission as I have of
the boy's cutting of
the corner, as well as rejecting the point of impact as
being further to the east of the intersection, that in any event, there was
no
negligence on the part of the driver and, that on any view, the accident was
inevitable.  I reject that submission.
<P>

73	I consider that in the circumstances of this case what happened was, indeed
I find, that the three boys including the plaintiff
were proceeding from a
position halfway down Kudilla Street towards the intersection; that the three
boys were almost in a line,
and that the plaintiff in fact was leading the two
other boys.  I am also satisfied that when the plaintiff in fact approached the
intersection he did so at or about a speed of or over twenty kilometres per
hour; and that he was drawing away from the other boys.
 It has not been
disputed, as I understand Mr Gross submissions that such finding as to speed is
one not open to me.  Indeed, it
is a finding as to that I make, it is a finding
consistent with what I believe took place.  It is consistent with my view of
the
boy proceeding down hill and deciding he needed some speed to move across
the intersection; and further that he neither braked or
slowed down as he
approached the intersection on the correct side of the road in order to do a
right hand turn into Thurlgona Road.
<P>

74	I reject the evidence of the two young boys, Rhys Baldwin and Adam Madigan,
to the extent that a suggestion is made that the
young boy, Simon, was entering
the intersection at a speed that was really less than twenty kilometres per
hour or even at a slow
speed.
<P>

75	I accept Mr Hughes' evidence that the boy entered the intersection at the
referred speed and that was a factor in his decision
to veer to the right,
rather than continue in the direction he was travelling.  I consider that the
boy, Simon, entered the intersection
or approached the entry having been on the
correct side of Kudilla Street, that he travelled down Kudilla Street on the
left hand
side or the correct side, that he correctly entered the intersection
in order to make a right hand turn into Thurlgona Road.
<P>

76	I accept, as I have said, that the boy was travelling at some speed in the
order of twenty kilometres per hour and that what
occurred, is that which I
have described.
<P>

77	The next matter that needs to be considered is whether, having regard to the
point of impact and the findings that I have made,
whether it is open to me to
find negligence on the part of the first and second defendants.  I have already
said, having regard to
what I find, there is no negligence involved on the part
of the third defendant.
<P>

78	Mr Neil submitted that even if I reject the view that the accident occurred
further to the east but found that the point of the
impact occurred in the
throat of the  intersection, that there was no negligence, or to use his
expression in the circumstances of
this case, the accident was inevitable.  As
I have said in my view that submission should be rejected.  In my opinion the
accident
happened in the mode and manner which I have described with the point
of the impact being in the intersection as I have described
it to be, after the
boy had come down the hill on his correct or the left hand side of Kudilla
Street and then entering the intersection
at about twenty kilometres per hour
or so.  I am thus satisfied that it is open to find negligence in this case.
<P>

79	Indeed, I am satisfied in the circumstances that negligence is to be found
on several bases.  Despite regulation 67(1) of the
 <b>Motor Traffic
Regulations 1935 (NSW)</b>  relating to giving way to the vehicle on the right
and despite the rules relating to the maximum legal speed, at common law I also
consider that the defendant breached his duty of care in failing to enter the
intersection exercising reasonable care in the circumstances.
<P>

80	I am also satisfied that in this case I can safely act upon the expert views
of Mr Joy and Mr Wingrove.  I am satisfied that
in the circumstances of this
case I should make a finding that the intervisibility of the boy for the driver
coming from an easterly
direction was something in the order of fifty to
fifty-five metres.
<P>

81	I am further satisfied that the driver was driving at an excessive speed
maintaining a speed in the location which was an unreasonable
speed of sixty
kilometres per hour.  I am satisfied that he should have been driving at a
lesser speed. I am also satisfied that
in any event even if he were driving at
a speed approximating sixty kilometres per hour he was in a situation where,
confronted with
the boy's accident, that he should have applied his brakes in
such a way as to avoid coming into contact with the boy.  True it is
that he
braked gently and veered to the right but, in my view, I believe that that was
not the appropriate or correct response in
the circumstances.  I believe that
even allowing for reaction time, that had the defendant driver had he applied
his full brakes
then and there when he saw the boy, he would have had the
opportunity of braking and stopping before an impact.  Instead he chose
to veer
to the right braking.  I consider that the driver should have braked when he
saw the boy, and done so fully, rather than
just lightly and merely veering on
to the incorrect side of the road. I also believe that this is a case where
because of the driver's
excessive speed that in the circumstances it affected
or impacted upon his capacity to be vigilant, and to keep a proper lookout.
 It
also impacted upon his reaction time.
<P>

82	I find that the driver was driving at an excessive speed.  Further, in my
view there was an inappropriate response, once the
boy had been seen by the
driver.
<P>

83	I also bear in mind when the boy was seen by the motorist coming from the
east the boy was not turning around or cutting the
south eastern corner of the
intersection, or was in that position but was, rather, in fact proceeding, as I
said, on his correct
side of the Kudilla Street and about to make a correct and
proper turn into Thurlgona Road.
<P>

84	In this case I accept the views of Mr Joy (at p 13 of his report) that the
approach speed of the van driven by Mr Hughes was
inappropriately high for the
narrow residential street with the driveways and the prevailing sixty
kilometres per hour speed limit.

<P>

85	I accept the opinion that having regard to the bicycle rider being on the
correct side of the road, that the evasive swerve by
Mr Hughes placed his
vehicle on a conflicting path with the bike rider as the rider proceeded to
make a right hand turn as he had
intended to do, into Thurlgona Road. I accept
Mr Joy's  view that had Mr Hughes braked heavily instead of swerving to the
right that
the collision could have been avoided or the impact substantially
lowered.  I also accept his view that had Mr Hughes braked heavily
as soon as
his visibility permitted he could have stopped his van before the accident.
Next, I also accept the view of Mr Wingrove
particularly stated (in para 19 of
his report) in the circumstances of this case. I generally accept the
conclusions and opinions
expressed by him in his report as well. I believe that
in this case the driver is to be found liable upon the basis that he was
driving
at an excessive speed in the circumstances, that he failed to brake or
stop when the boy was seen and further that he failed to keep
a proper lookout.
That said the matter of proper lookout is perhaps more closely connected with
the matter of speed.
<P>

86	In coming to this conclusion I might add that I also have regard to the
principles that relate to the liability of defendant
drivers generally as
discussed in the case of  <b><u>Stocks  v  Baldwin</u></b>  and also in the
case of  <b><u>Yu</u></b>.  I would also add that I have had full regard to the
duties and obligations owed by a driver particularly in circumstances where
children are injured or have been found to have suffered injuries in road
accidents.  On this point I would refer to the decisions
of the Court and to
the cases referred to in  <b><u>Lolomanaia  v Rush</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2024%20MVR%20128" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 24 MVR 128</a>,
and to  <b><u>Rush</u></b>  itself.  I have also had regard to the principles
as more recently discussed by the Court of Appeal in  <b><u>Gunning v
Fellows</u></b>   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2025%20MVR%2097" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 25 MVR 97.</a>
<P>

87	For all of these reasons I consider that in the circumstances, the
plaintiff, and indeed, the plaintiff's parents should succeed
in their action
and that liability should be found as and against the first and second
defendants but not the third defendant.
<P>

88	I now turn to the matter of contributory negligence which has loomed very
large as an issue in this case.
<P>

89	True the plaintiff was aged approximately twelve years at the time of the
subject accident; true he was not an adult.  Contributory
negligence, of
course, differs from negligence.  There is no duty of care owed to another
person and contributory negligence involves
conduct which exposes the actor to
the risk of injury without necessarily exposing others to risk (see
<b><u>Commissioner for Railways (Qld)  v  Ruprecht</u> </b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1979/37.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1979] HCA 37</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%20142%20CLR%20563" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 142 CLR 563</a>
at 570).
<P>

90	The standard of care in respect of contributory negligence is like the
standard of care in negligence, it depends upon forseeability.
 The standard of
care when an infant or child is involved in an accident is an objective one to
be measured in accordance with principles
laid down by the High Court in
<b><u>McHale  v  Watson</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1966/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1966] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%20115%20CLR%20199" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 115 CLR 199</a> and further discussed by
the Court of Appeal in such cases as  <b><u>Fellows</u> </b> to which reference
has already been made.  The test is objective.  There are a number of factors
to be brought into account.  The
principles relating to evaluation and
assessment of contributory negligence have been well discussed.  They need not
be repeated.
 The relevant principles are to be found in decisions of the High
Court in  <b><u>Podrebersek  v  Australian Iron and Steel</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%2059%20ALJR%20492" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 59
ALJR 492</a> and referred to and discussed particularly by Justice Simos in
<b><u>Stocks  v  Baldwin</u></b>  (supra) at p 426.
<P>

91	In  <b><u>Podrebersek</u></b>  the High Court said (at 493-494):
<P>

	"A finding on the question of apportionment ...  It involves an individual
choice or discretion as to which there may be differences
of opinion by
different minds ...."
<P>

92	In this case I, despite the plaintiff's age and despite his infancy,
consider the that plaintiff's contributory negligence was
significant.  Mr Neil
has submitted that were I to find that there was negligence on the part of
first and second defendants that
the contributory negligence of the plaintiff
should be somewhere in the order of eighty percent.  Mr Gross submitted were I
to find
contributory negligence, that I should find it to be no more than in
the order of perhaps fifteen to twenty percent.
<P>

93	I am satisfied that, as I said, the boy entered riding his bike into the
intersection at a speed of at or about twenty kilometres
per hour and was not
braking at the time he did so.  He was riding into a T intersection to cross
the top of the T.  He had to make
a right hand turn.  I am also satisfied in
the same way as the driver could have seen the plaintiff so could the bike
rider have
also seen the driver as the driver proceeded west in Thurlgona
Road.
<P>

94	I also have regard when considering the matter of contributory negligence,
to the fact that the plaintiff was a child.  I have
also had regard to the fact
that the plaintiff was riding a bike.  However, the defendant was driving a
heavy truck which could cause
considerable injury were he to breach his duty to
take reasonable care for other persons:  see  (<b><u>Pennington  v
Norris</u></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1956/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281956%29%2096%20CLR%2010" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1956) 96 CLR 10</a>  <b><u>Stocks  v Baldwin</u></b>;
<b><u>Gunning  v  Fellows</u></b>)  and other cases I have referred to.
<P>

95	Matters, and I do not seek to be exhaustive in my list, that I regard as
being of particular significance in this case, includes
the boy's speed on
approaching the intersection at twenty kilometres per hour and the finding that
the boy in my view did not stop
or slow down as he in entered that intersection
at or about that speed.  I have also referred to the fact that the boy breached
regulation
67(1) of the  <b>Motor Traffic Regulations</b>  in failing to give
way to the vehicle on his right:  see  <b><u>Sibley  v  Kais</u></b>.
<P>

96	The boy was riding a bike which he was competent to ride.  He approached the
intersection.  He was capable of seeing the vehicle
on the right.  He ignored
the call of his brother to  "Stop, Simon".  He failed to slow down or stop at
the intersection.  I would
observe in passing that the brother, Adam Madigan,
was aware of the need for some caution on an approach to an intersection such
as this.  He said that he actually shouted to his older brother to,  "Stop,
Simon".
<P>

97	There are other matters which I believe in this particular case should be
brought into account.  It has not been argued they
should be ignored.  I shall
refer to them.  The plaintiff was an experienced rider.  As I have already
indicated, he came from a
family where there were bike riders where the father
was keen on bike riding and where the siblings were keen on bike riding.  The
plaintiff had been a bike rider for some years prior to the accident, having
owned his bicycle for a couple of years.  Indeed on
this particular occasion,
the boy had specific and particular instructions in relation  to riding on the
road.  According to Mr Madigan
he knew that the boys could ride their bikes on
the road.  He had taught the young man to ride, he was satisfied that the young
man,
provided he exercised good and proper care could be permitted to ride on
the road, on a public road.  Not only had he given him general
instructions and
not only was the boy an experienced rider, but specifically on the afternoon in
question, the father said (at p
102) that the plaintiff when he left St John of
Bosco Primary School with the two boy friends had been also told by him to stay
on
the left hand side and that he did not want any mucking around.  He was
satisfied that Adam and Simon, prior to this had received
instructions relating
to safety on bikes.
<P>

98	However, the matter does not stop there.  Not only had the boy been given
specific instructions on road safety beforehand but
also two to three weeks
before the accident, the boy had completed a bike eduction week at the St John
of Bosco School where the
police had come to the school to teach bike safety in
relation to use of bikes.
<P>

99	I am satisfied that Simon attended  bike safety week and understood the
additional requirements and he was taught by teachers
and by police officers. I
am also satisfied that Simon, according to his father, knew the rules that had
to be applied in relation
to the responsibilities, obligations and rules  in
relation to bikes.  These are additional matters which I believe are
significant
in terms of evaluating the degree of experience on the part of the
plaintiff.  It is not suggested I should ignore them.
<P>

100	I also take into account, of course, that the plaintiff may like all
children not have recalled lessons that have been taught
to them.  That is
involved in the nature of being a child and something to be considered when
determining what is the proper measure
of contributory negligence.
<P>

101	I consider that in the circumstances of this case should be found to have
been guilty of contributory negligence to the extent
of forty per cent.
<P>

102	There should be a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff as and against the
first and second defendant, a verdict and judgment
for the third defendant.  In
respect of the plaintiff child's parents action for nervous shock, there should
be a verdict and judgment
for each of them in this action as and against the
first time and second defendants.  There should be a verdict and judgment for
the third defendant in each of their cases.
<P>
