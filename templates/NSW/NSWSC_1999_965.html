<b>MONDAY 13 SEPTEMBER 1999</b>

<b><u>2384/99 JOBNET EMPLOYMENT SERVICES INCORPORATED &amp; ORS v ALWYN COPEMAN
&amp; ORS</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b> The only question left in this matter
is the question of costs.  As I indicated in my earlier judgement, in my view
the proceedings
were brought about in the main by the conduct of the first
defendant and the eighth defendant. Nevertheless, all defendants purported
to
be members of the committee of the first plaintiff, and they have failed in
that they have purported to act as members of the
committee elected at a
meeting which was not properly constituted.  Without that these proceedings
would probably not have been necessary
irrespective of the lack of procedural
correctness in the way that the first plaintiff has conducted its affairs.
<P>

2   	So far as the plaintiffs are concerned, in the second group
of plaintiffs Jill Blunden and Judy Twemlow have been found not
to be members
of the first plaintiff or of its committee, albeit that it was expected that
they were.  In my view no order for costs
can be made in their favour but no
separate order for costs should be made against them.
<P>

3   	I consider that the first plaintiff, having brought these
proceedings and having established that those persons who purported
to take
control of it were not entitled to do so, is also entitled to its costs and has
standing.  In those circumstances, the successful
plaintiffs should have their
costs against all the defendants except Mr Smith whom I would wish to refer to
separately.
<P>

4   	There can be no doubt that Mr Smith took an active part in
the matters which gave rise to these proceedings.  He purported
to act as the
chairman of a new committee which was not ever elected as a committee. While he
filed an appearance in these proceedings
and at one of the directions hearings
it was foreshadowed that he would submit, as far as I can ascertain he has
never done so, that
foreshadowing being subject to final instructions which are
not shown ever to have been given.
<P>

5   	It follows that it is my view that all defendants should be
made liable for any costs order in favour of the plaintiffs, but
that each of
those defendants, other than the first defendant and the eighth defendant
should have the right to seek an order that
they be indemnified by the first
and eighth defendants.
<P>

6   	An application has been made for indemnity costs on the
basis that the defendants or at least the first and eighth defendants
were
putting forward a claim which could not have been made out and should not have
been put forward.  Firstly the first plaintiff,
as all the plaintiffs, have not
succeeded in that claim and, secondly, the affairs of the first plaintiff in my
view were not conducted
in such a way as to justify an order of indemnity costs
and I refuse that application.
<P>

<P>

<b>ORDERS</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b> The orders that I make are as
follows:
<P>

1.	Declare that Silvano Bevinetto is a member of the committee of the first
plaintiff and that Jill Blunden and Judy Twemlow are
not members of that
committee.
<P>

2.	Declare that the first, fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth and ninth defendants
are not members of the committee of the first plaintiff.
<P>

3.	Declare that the first and seventh defendants are members of the first
plaintiff and that the eighth defendant is not a member
of the first
plaintiff.
<P>

4.	Declare that the purported meetings of the first plaintiff held on 19 May
1998 and 11 May 1999 are not valid meetings and are
of no effect.
<P>

5.	Declare that the eighth defendant was an employee of the first plaintiff
when she was dismissed on or about 4 March 1999.
<P>

6.	Declare that the persons listed in paragraph 6 of the amended summons are
not members of the first plaintiff.
<P>

7.	Order the defendants pay the costs of the first plaintiff and of Silvano
Bevinetto including reserved costs.
<P>

2   	No order as to costs of Jill Blunden and Judy Twemlow.
<P>

3   	Leave to the defendants other than the first defendant and
the eighth defendant to apply for an order they be indemnified against
their
liability for costs by the first and/or the eighth defendant.
<P>

4   	The exhibits can be returned.
