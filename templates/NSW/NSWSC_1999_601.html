&amp; GENERAL INSURANCE LIMITED &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>EX TEMPORE</b>
<P>

1   	This is a Notice of Motion brought by the defendants for
security for costs pursuant to pt 53 r 2 (e) of the Supreme Court
Rules and s
1335 of the Corporations Law that the plaintiff give security in the sum of
$516,424 additional to a previous amount
to which I will refer in due
course.
<P>

2   	The Notice of Motion has had a history commencing, it
appears, on 7 May before Einstein J when the plaintiff, the respondent
to the
motion, apparently sought an adjournment for two weeks which was granted by his
Honour.  On 20 May 1999 the matter was fixed
for hearing on 28 May 1999,
although a judge was not designated to hear it at that time. 	
<P>

3   	It is necessary to detail a little history in this matter
because it came before me on 28 May 1999 for hearing of the motion
but also in
respect of what could be described as the finalisation of an argument in
respect of the Notice to Produce that had been
served by the defendants, the
applicants to the motion, for various documents relating to a legal opinion.
It sought to challenge
the then claimed loan arrangement and an insurance
policy backing for costs of these proceedings that the plaintiff had suggested
was in place.  
<P>

4   	The proceedings themselves, that is the main proceedings,
were commenced in March 1998.  The summons  sets out in detail the
plaintiff's
claim against the defendants.  Although it has been variously described
throughout the hearing of this application as
a straight-forward or simple
matter, a reading of the summons lends the reader to the conclusion that it is
perhaps not as simple
as has been suggested.
<P>

5   	The plaintiff makes a number of claims including that the
defendants are liable to pay the plaintiff certain amounts of money
totalling,
as it then was, approximately $US8.4 million.  The claims include a breach of
contract and breach of implied terms of
contract.  There are claims of
misleading and deceptive conduct with allegations that the alleged
representations made by the defendants
were false and that the defendant did
not have reasonable grounds for making the representations.
<P>

6   	There is an additional claim that the second and third
defendants aided, abetted, counselled and procured the contravention
of the
section of the Trade Practices Act, essentially a claim under s 75B of the
Trade Practices Act.
<P>

7   	There is also a claim of breach of fiduciary duty with a
number of paragraphs setting out the purported basis of the way in
which that
fiduciary duty arises.  Additionally, there are claims for the construing of a
trust, unjust enrichment, a breach of implied
term and misleading and deceptive
conduct in respect of future and further negotiations.  Albeit claims of that
nature can be straight-forward,
the parties are at issue as to whether it is a
simple claim.  That has some bearing on this application for a rather large
amount
of security for costs.
<P>

8   	The Defence which was filed on 15 April 1998 puts the
contentions of the plaintiff in issue.  It is a detailed and apparently
careful
Defence which runs to some twenty-one pages and there is a reply to it.  The
reply deals with the $2 million payment which
was to be paid on the signing of
the joint venture.  
<P>

9   	The defendants put on a cross-claim of which paragraph 7
pleads:
<P>

"By the summons filed in the proceedings ASIA asserts, inter alia, that it was
a term of the agreement that HIH agreed to pay ASIA
the sum of $US5 million for
the right to acquire the 27% interest or alternatively, for the 27% interest."

<P>

Paragraph 10 pleads:
<P>

"<b>For the purpose of this cross-claim only</b>, HIH says that if in the
proceedings it is found that the agreement included the term (a reference to
paragraph 7) HIH is entitled
to recover the part payment by way of restitution
consequent upon ASIA's failure to transfer the 27% interest,"
<P>

10   	The matter came before Rolfe J on 26 May 1999 and as I
have indicated, that was in relation to a Notice to Produce that was
served by
the defendants.  That Notice to Produce sought copies of the advice of Mr
Martin Einfeld QC and various other documents
relating to the arrangements that
had been put in place by the plaintiff. 
<P>

11   	To comprehend the manner in which this case has been
conducted, it is appropriate to refer to some communications between
the
plaintiff and the defendants which occurred in 1998.  The defendants are
represented by Messrs Clayton Utz, Solicitors, and the
plaintiff is represented
by Peter Kemp, Solicitors.  
<P>

12   	The solicitors for the defendants wrote to the plaintiff's
solicitors in March 1998 and raised the question of security for
costs.  From
correspondence that is annexed to an affidavit of Mr Matthew Kaley, it appears
that there had been some initial agreement
for the provision of some security
but the amount was unacceptable to the defendants' solicitors by reason of a
number of matters
that came to their notice.  Those matters included the
material gleaned from Australian Securities Commission records in relation
to
the plaintiff which evidenced trading losses of the plaintiff for 1994 of
$173,537; at the end of 1995 approximately $1.4 million
and at the end of 1996,
$1.7 million.  Those records also demonstrated deficiencies in shareholders'
funds during that period.
<P>

13   	The solicitors for the defendants in asking for security
for costs were met with the suggestion by the plaintiff's solicitors
that the
defendants' solicitors should be mindful that the impoverishment of the
plaintiff was a direct result of the conduct of
the defendants.  In response to
that suggestion, the defendants, understandably, pointed to the material to
which I have just referred
and suggested to the plaintiff's solicitors that
their client was impoverished prior to any approach to the defendants and so it
was that the parties were locked into a battle in respect of whether security
should be supplied and how much.  That battle continued
from March 1998 through
to 12 June 1998 when an agreement was reached between the parties which was
recorded in some short minutes
filed in this Court on 12 June.   Those short
minutes read as follows:
<P>

"By consent and without admissions:
<P>

1.	The plaintiff within 21 days give security for the defendants' costs up to
and including filing and service of their witness
statements.  Such security to
be in the form of a bank guarantee in the sum of $250,000 in terms to be agreed
between the solicitors
for the parties.
<P>

2.	Costs of the defendants' Notice of Motion for security for costs to be costs
in the cause.
<P>

3.	Liberty to apply on three days' notice (including liberty to the defendants
to apply to increase the security referred to in
1 above after the said filing
and service of the said defendants' statements.)"
<P>

14   	Importantly in November 1998 the plaintiff was placed into
voluntary liquidation and on 23 December 1998 the defendants' solicitors
wrote
to the plaintiff's solicitors, once again indicating that they wished to
increase the security as had been impliedly anticipated
in the short minutes of
order dated 12 June 1998.  Messrs Clayton Utz requested a bank bond to be
increased to $669,332.  In response
Peter Kemp, indicated that the application
was rejected and said: 
<P>

"Indeed, in circumstances where funding in the sum of $1.2 million has been
obtained from GIO Finance (which includes any costs
of the defendant incurred
after filing and serving witness statements) the need for security for costs is
obviated entirely."
<P>

15   	The solicitor for the plaintiff then provided some detail
in relation to that funding arrangement.   Not surprisingly, Messrs
Clayton Utz
wrote back on 13 January as follows:
<P>

"If your client intends to maintain that the funding arrangement obviates the
need for further security, we ask you to provide us
with a copy of all
agreements and other documents that set out or affect those terms."
<P>

16   	On 27 January 1999 Peter Kemp wrote to Messrs Clayton Utz
and informed them that he was instructed not to provide the various
documents
associated with the funding of the proceedings.  On 2 February 1999 Messrs
Clayton Utz gave notice that the security for
costs application would be
pressed and the notice came before the Court on 7 May,1999.
<P>

17   	The Notice to Produce to which I have earlier referred
related to some documents that had been served upon the defendants'
solicitors
as exhibits to the affidavit of Mr Peter Kemp of 7 May 1999.  Those exhibits
were entitled PK1 to PK7.  In PK7 there is
a reference to a copy of the advice
from Mr Martin Einfeld QC dated 16 September 1998, being annexed to PK7 and
which became exhibit
B before me.  That document was not annexed to that
exhibit, and the matter was agitated before Rolfe J to obtain copies of it,
together
with other relevant documents.  
<P>

18   	It is apparent from the records on the file, and in
particular Rolfe J's judgment of 26 May 1999, that the parties, represented
by
Mr Curtis of counsel for the defendants/applicants in the motion, and Mr
Dempsey of counsel for the plaintiff/respondent in the
motion, argued for some
three hours before his Honour on that day.  His Honour reached the conclusion
on page 5 of his judgment that
he was:
<P>

"expressing a prima facie view, that once the plaintiff either seeks to assert
that it has a loan agreement and an insurance policy
without more, it must be
open to the defendants to go behind those documents to see other constituent
documents and the circumstances
in which the loan agreement and the insurance
policy may be applicable."
<P>

19   	His Honour directed the plaintiff to serve on the
solicitors for the defendants by 1 o'clock on 27 May an outline of all
statements
upon which it relied in opposition to the application for security
for costs, together with all affidavits upon which it proposed
to rely and his
Honour stood the motion over to Friday 28 May, at which time it came before me.

<P>

20   	At the commencement of the hearing before me the
defendants relied upon the affidavits of Mr Matthew Kaley of 11 May 1998
and 31
March 1999, together with the affidavits of Ms Vine-Hall of 12 May 1998 and 30
March 1999.
<P>

21   	The respondent to the motion, the plaintiff, relied upon
the affidavits of Scott Cameron of 27 May 1999 (two in number), two
affidavits
of Mr John Evans of 27 May 1999 and an affidavit of Mr Allan Robinson of 27 May
1999, and the affidavit of Mr Peter Kemp
of 7 May 1999, and tendered the
exhibits to that affidavit PK1 to 6 which became respectively exhibits 1.1
through to 1.6(PK7 was
not tendered by the plaintiff).
<P>

22   	It was necessary to hear some argument in respect of the
calls for documents made orally by Mr Curtis, as well as the Notice
to Produce
that had been before Rolfe J on 26 May.  That included reading Ms Vine-Hall's
affidavit in reply to Mr Robinson's affidavit
dated 28 May 1999 and also the
tendering of what was formerly known as PK7 which then became exhibit B before
me. 
<P>

23   	After some further submissions and at about quarter to
one, the case having commenced at approximately 10.20am, Mr Dempsey
for the
plaintiff took a forensic decision which was to withdraw any reliance upon the
affidavits of the plaintiff other than the
affidavit of Allan Robinson of 27
May 1999.  Quantum seemed to be the only issue.  It was therefore a matter of
Ms Vine-Hall's and
Mr Robinson's evidence being tested.  The matter concluded
at approximately 3.50pm when I stood the matter over to 9.30 this morning
for
further submissions which concluded at approximately 11.30am, at which time I
stood the matter over until 2pm today for judgment.
  
<P>

24   	The plaintiff has submitted that in the circumstances this
is an oppressive application brought by the defendants.  Indeed,
it couches
those submissions in terms which suggest that if I were to follow the
applicants' approach I may be penalising the plaintiff
in these proceedings.
The first position adopted by Mr Dempsey deals with the strength of the
plaintiff's case.  In support of that
submission he tendered some documentary
material which became exhibit 2 before me which consists of a number of letters
between the
plaintiff and the defendants.  The first is the letter of 20
October 1995 from the chairman of the plaintiff to the managing director
of the
first defendant.  In that letter there is reference to a discussion which
apparently occurred the day before and then proceeds:
<P>

"This letter confirms your agreement to the terms of remuneration payable to
Asia Strategic Investment Alliance Limited (or its
nominee) in respect of the
insurance joint venture in The People's Republic of China with Mr Wang Jian Cai
and Yong An Insurance
Co."
<P>

25   	The letter then purports to set out the agreement as to
terms of remuneration and a price for the option of the plaintiff
for the
acquisition of twenty-seven per cent in a joint venture of $US5 million which
was detailed to be as follows:
<P>

"1.  Upon signing Letter of intent  $USD1 million
<P>

 2.  Upon assignment of option or
<P>

     preliminary agreement with
<P>

     consortium                     $USD3 million
<P>

 3.  Upon signing Joint Venture
<P>

     Agreement                      $USD1 million"
<P>

	
<P>

26   	There is then a reference to the $US4.4 million cash
payment arrangement and alternative arrangements subject to Mr Wang's
approval.
<P>

27   	On 23 October 1995 the managing director of the first
defendant sent a letter to the chairman of the plaintiff in which he
referred
to the option fee of $US5 million being made up as follows:
<P>

"1.  Upon signing Letter of Intent  	$US1 million
<P>

 2.  Upon signing Joint Venture
<P>

     Agreement with Mr Wang Jian
<P>

     Cai                            			$US2 million
<P>

 3.  Upon the gross earned 
<P>

     premiums of Yong An Insurance 
<P>

	Co or its subsidiary reaching 
<P>

     $US60 million                  		$US2 million "
<P>

28   	The plaintiff also relied upon a media release to
demonstrate the strength of its case.  On 19 September 1996 the first defendant
announced that it had been involved in a massive venture in the Asian insurance
market and that it had unveiled a strategy initiative
to enter the general
insurance market in The People's Republic of China through a joint venture
involving a newly financed domestic
insurance company.  It is suggested that
the chief executive, Mr Williams, who is the second defendant in these
proceedings, said:
<P>

"The joint venture initiative signalled a substantial long-term commitment to
the world's most important emerging insurance market."
<P>

29   	On 27 May 1999 the plaintiff abandoned the third limb of
its case, that is, the $US2 million payment in respect of the earnings
of $US60
million of the Yong An Insurance Company to which I made reference earlier.
That is seized upon by the defendants as a significant
matter to this aspect of
the matter, and perhaps rightly so.  The documentation in respect of that
abandonment has not been filed
and is to await the outcome of further
discussion between counsel. 	
<P>

30   	The main evidence before me is the evidence of the two
expert legal costs consultants, Ms Vine-Hall for the defendants and
Mr Robinson
for the plaintiff.
<P>

31   	Ms Vine-Hall attended the premises of the defendants'
solicitors and swore affidavits in respect of the previous application
for
costs in 1998, which was ultimately settled on 12 June, and also in relation to
this application.  Ms Vine-Hall is clearly a
person of appropriate background
to be assisting the Court in relation to this type of case.  She has been the
director of DSA Legal
Costs Consultants Pty Limited since July 1993, but having
worked in that business which she established since July 1990.  Ms Vine-Hall
was assisted by Mr Kaley in assessing the nature of the issues between the
parties to which she refers in paragraph 7 of her affidavit
of 12 May 1998.

<P>

32   	She was asked to provide an opinion on the probable
party/party costs which would be awarded to the defendants and has done
so in
respect of various time frames; firstly, up to and including the preparation of
the witness statements upon which the defendants
intended to rely, which matter
is covered by her affidavit of 12 May 1998, and thereafter on work done from 8
May 1998 and work to
be undertaken in the further preparation of the matter up
to the hearing. 
<P>

33   	Ms Vine-Hall has set out what Mr Curtis points to as an
important feature of her work and her assessment in this matter in
paras 16 and
17.  It is appropriate that I refer to those paragraphs:
<P>

"16. In determining the probable party/party recoverability of the costs
incurred by the defendants to date, it is necessary to
take into account, in
accordance with section 208F(1) of the Act, how the work has been delegated and
what rates have been charged
for particular types of work.  In view of the
speed of the preparation of this matter, I consider that it is reasonable for a
solicitor
of the experience of Mr Lees to have been substantially involved in
the preparation of the defence and discovery.  In my opinion,
there might be an
argument that there has been some work undertaken by Mr Lees which might have
been undertaken by a solicitor of
lesser experience, which could be addressed
by an adjustment to the number of hours 'allowed' to Mr Lees at his rate. I
have made
such an adjustment in forming my opinion expressed at paragraph
18.
<P>

17.  In my experience of the rates usually charged by large CBD firms such as
Allen Allen &amp; Hemsley, Blake Dawson Waldron, Baker
&amp; McKenzie, Minter
Ellison, Malleson Stephen Jaques, Phillips Fox and Abbot Tout, which are firms
of the size which regularly
undertake litigation of the size and complexity of
the present litigation, the rates charged by Clayton Utz are at the higher end
of the range for solicitors of the experience of Mr Lees, Mr Kaley and Mr
Anderson.  In order to estimate the probable recovery of
costs on a party and
party basis, I would make an allowance for the fact that an assessor might
reduce the rates to the mid range
of the firms I have described in this
paragraph. "
<P>

34   	Ms Vine-Hall goes on to make an assessment in 1998 of the
costs likely to be recoverable, taking into account those matters
to which she
referred.  I shall return to the matter of Mr Lees in due course, but it is
clear that the litigation was brought on
promptly with an apparent speed which
Ms Vine-Hall took into account in making an assessment of the involvement of a
partner at the
same time as a senior associate.  She said in her affidavit that
the matter was in the Commercial Division and it was already proceeding
fairly
swiftly.  She also made reference to a tight time-table which had been fixed
and the fact it was planned to adhere to that
tight time-table.
<P>

35   	The observation made by Ms Vine-Hall in respect of the
involvement of the senior partner or a partner in the firm is one that
was not
challenged in cross-examination.  Indeed, one only has to comprehend the
importance of the aspects of this case to the individual
defendants to
understand that when matters are proceeding swiftly it would not be
unreasonable to have a person such as a partner
involved, at least for a
proportion of the time initially, to assist and/or guide the senior associate
if that was thought to be
necessary and appropriate.
<P>

36   	The second affidavit, which is the affidavit of 30 March
1999, as I say deals with the later work done by the defendants'
solicitors and
specifically refers to the fact that Mr Kaley informed Ms Vine-Hall that in
making her assessment she was not to take
into account any work undertaken in
relation to the voluntary liquidation of the plaintiff or the work relating to
the cross-claim
to which I have referred earlier. 
<P>

37   	The assessments made by Ms Vine-Hall are attacked in the
affidavit of Mr Robinson who also gave evidence and was also cross-examined.
Mr Robinson has also had quite a deal of experience as a legal costs
consultant.  I should say that both the expert witnesses are
graduate lawyers
and have practised as such prior to moving into the field of legal costs
consulting.  Mr Robinson has offered an
opinion in respect of what may be
recoverable by way of party/party costs on the basis of what assessors do under
the present costs
regime.  He said specifically that those assessors "have
difficulty in allowing hourly rates for solicitors in excess of $300 per
hour".
 
<P>

38   	On this point Mr Robinson was cross-examined by Mr Curtis
to the point where he had to admit that there was room to move in
respect of
the $300.  When I asked him if he could assist me on how much room there was,
he informed me that he could not.
<P>

39   	The second aspect of his opinion expressed in relation to
the assessors not allowing anything more than $300, was that they
also had
difficulty in allowing hourly rates for solicitors in excess of the hourly rate
charged by or allowed to counsel.  He was
once again effectively cross-examined
on that statement and admitted his statement was "too broad" and that he had
not put "enough
detail" in it, but accepted when Mr Curtis pressed him, and
pressed him appropriately, that the statement was meaningless.
<P>

40   	Mr Robinson then expressed what he described as "concerns"
in respect of the defendants' estimates of party/party costs and
one of the
things that he did was to take the data from the time of initial instructions,
or thereabouts, to a particular date, which
it was apparent was the date upon
which the statements were filed.  He then calculated how many hours had been
spent by the various
legal representatives of the defendants over that period
and those were simple mathematical approaches from the provision of the
time
costing and various other records of the defendants' solicitors.  He then said,
"Averaging the hours worked between the working
days, legally qualified
professional staff were engaged on the matter an average of 8.05 hours per
working day."  
<P>

41   	He made a similar assessment in respect of Mr Kaley's
involvement showing that he had been involved on average 3.65 hours
per day or
5.24 hours per working day.  He was pressed on this analysis because Mr Curtis,
no doubt, was clearly concerned to establish
whether he, Mr Robinson, had
formed any view of the reasonableness or otherwise of those hours having been
incurred by the defendants'
solicitors.
<P>

42   	The course of that evidence troubled me because I was not
confident by the end of it that Mr Robinson had stated his propositions
clearly
enough for me to understand what he meant.  It is clear that he did not intend
to convey ultimately that the hours had not
been worked.  That much I thought
was clear, but it seems to me that there was a residuum of concern,
notwithstanding the once again
very careful cross-examination by Mr Curtis.
Ultimately it does not matter because Mr Robinson was not able to tell me
whether it
was or it was not reasonable.  He just said it was something that
gave him some concern.  
<P>

43   	Additionally, Mr Robinson was taken to two conclusions
which he reached the first contained in paras 17 and 18 of his affidavit,
and
the second contained in paras 19 and 20 of his affidavit.  They respectively
relate to the annexures marked A and B.  It is clear
from Mr Robinson's
evidence that the weight that I can give to those annexures is not great.
Indeed, Mr Curtis was able to obtain
admissions from Mr Robinson which leave me
in the position of having little assistance from Mr Robinson in respect of this
matter.
Just looking at one aspect to test that conclusion that I have reached,
for instance annexure A refers to item I, the second application
for security
for costs.  It allows approximately thirty-one and a half hours.   
<P>

44   	The second application for security for costs, on the
history that I have given, has been contemplated and agitated since
28 December
1998.   It has been the subject of that correspondence to which I have
referred; it has been the subject of the preparation
of the affidavits to which
I have referred; the perusing of what seem to be numerous affidavits of the
plaintiff and the necessity
to peruse the material now contained in exhibits
1.1 to 1.6 and exhibit B, and the decision to seek the production of documents
in
relation to the funding arrangements as referred to in exhibit B and
ultimately in Rolfe J's judgment of 26 May 1999.  It seems to
me that 31.65
hours on a party/party basis may be somewhat unrealistic.  
<P>

45   	In any event, what I am left with is, therefore, the
affidavits of Ms Vine-Hall.  In my view the evidence of Ms Vine-Hall
is
preferable to the evidence of Mr Robinson.
<P>

46   	Mr Dempsey submits that the plaintiff, as an impecunious
party, would be placed in a very difficult position should I order
the security
sought by the defendants, because effectively it would be prevented from
proving its claim unless security was provided,
whereas the defendants would be
able to prosecute the cross-claim.  In this regard Mr Curtis submits the
defendants' position clearly
stated is that it has no entitlement to sue upon
the claims in its cross-claim without the plaintiff first establishing its
claims,
or part of them, in the summons.
<P>

47   	Mr Curtis makes this submission to defeat the claim made
by Mr Dempsey that the line of authorities to which he referred me,
in
particular to Ormiston J's judgment in <b>Interwest Ltd v Tricontinental
Corporation Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%205%20ACSR%20621" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 5 ACSR 621</a> disentitle the defendants to this order
because of the cross-claim.
<P>

48   	It seems if Mr Curtis' analysis of his cross-claim is
correct, Ormiston J's statements on 621 and 622 have little bearing
on this
matter.  Mr Curtis submits his cross-claim is truly defensive and relies upon
paras 7 to 10 referred to earlier.  
<P>

49   	The plaintiff claims that the defendants' application is
extravagant and oppressive and the quantum of costs is, prima facie,
exorbitant.  The quantum of costs may present as high, but Ms Vine-Hall has
dealt with that aspect of the matter in her affidavit
of 12 May 1998 to which I
have referred earlier.  Much of the opposition of the plaintiff is reliant upon
Mr Robinson and it seems
to me that that opposition is somewhat diminished by
the findings I have made in respect of the evidence of Mr Robinson.
<P>

50   	Ms Vine-Hall, in her affidavit of 30 March 1999, in
particular in para 28, sets out an estimate of the defendants' likely
recoverable costs in a total amount of $713,528.  
<P>

51   	In addition, there is one aspect of the matter to which I
have not referred but I shall do so now and that is contempt proceedings
which
have been instigated by the defendants.  Those proceedings apparently relate to
conduct of the plaintiff in these proceedings.
 The position of the plaintiff
is that the security for costs should not include an amount of costs pertaining
to the contempt proceedings.
 
<P>

52   	Mr Curtis submits that where a defendant is sued by an
impecunious plaintiff, they should not be put in a position of disadvantage
if,
prior to the final hearing, the plaintiff fails to do something that makes it
necessary for the defendant to incur further costs.
 An important aspect of
that submission is the word "necessary".  The Statement of Charge and the
details of the hearing are not
before me.  Indeed, there is no evidence before
me in respect of that set of proceedings other than Ms Vine-Hall's evidence
relating
to the costs incurred and the reasonableness or otherwise of them. 
<P>

53   	It seems to me that the defendants are not entitled to
have the costs of the contempt proceedings included in this application
because
there is no evidence that it was necessary for them to bring the proceedings
and without that evidence it seems to me their
application must fail in that
regard.  
<P>

54   	Mr Curtis had submitted there was some evidence of the
necessity of the proceedings because the plaintiff has included a reference
to
the possibility of a fine having to be included in the funding arrangements
which are referred to in exhibit 1.1.  I am not persuaded
by that submission
and I therefore do not consider the costs of the contempt proceedings to be
appropriately included in this application.
  
<P>

55   	The circumstances of this case which have led me to the
conclusion I have reached include the apparent difference in approach
between
the letters of 20 October 1995 and 23 October 1995 in exhibit 2; the
abandonment of an apparently very important aspect of
this case the night
before this application came on; the conduct of the plaintiff in pursuing this
application and defending it in
the way it has since 28 December 1998;  and the
initial reliance upon evidence which the defendants had to deal with up until
at
least halfway through the hearing with the consequent abandonment of it.
Although I am not sure that I agree with Mr Curtis' submission,
that the
plaintiff was playing possum with this Court, it does seem to me that it was a
very large waste of the Court's time.
<P>

56   	On the matters to which I must have regard, as referred to
by Beazley J in <b>KP Cable Investments v Meltglo Pty Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1995/76.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] FCA 76</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2056%20FCR%20189" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 56 FCR
189</a>, I am satisfied that there are some real issues for trial.
<P>

57   	Secondly, having regard to the abandonment of the
<P>

claim on the Thursday night, and although I am not satisfied that the plaintiff
is not bona fide, it does bring into question some
aspects of the alleged
strength of the plaintiff's claim that perhaps need to be reassessed.
<P>

58   	Thirdly, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff's
impecuniosity was caused by the defendant's conduct, in particular having
regard to the material in Mr Kaley's affidavit which demonstrates the
developing impecuniosity of the plaintiff prior to the time
it commenced
dealing with the defendants.
<P>

59   	In all the circumstances, I intend to order further
security for costs but not in the amount in the notice of motion. 
<P>

60   	Doing the best I can on the state of the evidence before
me, I should return to a matter to which I said I would return, and
that is the
involvement of Mr Lees in the litigation.
<P>

61   	It is not clear whether it was Mr Lees or Mr Kaley who was
involved during the earlier period because of a statement made
by Mr Kaley that
Mr Lees was on some leave.  In any event the amounts of time referred to in
paragraph 15 of the affidavit of 12
May 1999 are the ones to which Mr Robinson
made reference in his affidavit and, although Ms Vine-Hall has taken the matter
into account
and reduced what might be called the large amount of time to a
minimum amount, I am still of the view that it is appropriate to discount
Mr
Lees' time.  Therefore the costs of Mr Lees and Mr Kaley in that period of the
work done to 8 May 1998 should be reduced by $30,000.
<P>

62   	Returning then to paragraph 28 of Ms Vine-Hall's affidavit
and the costs of $425,778 for the period 8 May 1998 to 15 January
1999, which
includes a figure for litigation support which is referred to in practice note
105 of the Supreme Court Rules.  There
has been no direction in respect of that
matter in this case.  It seems, however, from the material before me, that to
allow the
whole amount of $34,900, and to allow the work of Senior Associates,
Solicitors and Counsel in respect of the same work, ie the data
base, the
collection of documents and the collating of documents for discovery, is an
estimate which requires adjustment. I intend
to reduce the figure of $425,778
to $390,000. That then reaches a figure in paragraph 28 of $677,950 and there
should then be a reduction
of $250,000 from that which reaches a figure of
$427,750. I have to take into account the figure of $30,000 which I have
reduced
the other figures by, which gives a figure of $397,750. 
<P>

63   	In those circumstances I make an order that the plaintiff
give further security in the sum of $397,750 for the defendant's
costs incurred
up to the date of making this order and to be incurred up to but not including
the hearing of the matter. I make an
order that until the security referred to
in that order is given the claims by the plaintiff are stayed. 
<P>

64   	I make an order that the defendants have liberty to apply:
(a) to increase the amount of security referred to in my first
order should
that amount prove inadequate; (b) for security for their costs to be incurred
on the commencement of the hearing of
this matter. 
<P>

(Mr Curtis sought costs of today on an indemnity basis
<P>

and handed her Honour written submissions in that regard. Counsel addressed on
the question of costs).
<P>

65   	This is an application for indemnity costs followingthe
orders I have just made in favour of the applicant in the motion on
the basis
that the plaintiff was aware as at 5 January 1999, when its solicitors
indicated to the defendant's solicitors that the
need for security for costs
was obviated, that it was embarking upon a case in which it was of the opinion
that it was likely that
security for costs would be ordered in the amount of
$250,000. 
<P>

66   	That submission is made in the light of a number of
documents, including Mr Kemp's letter of 5 January 1999 which is annexure
E to
the affidavit of Matthew Kaley, and exhibit B, which is the liquidators
document entitled "Liquidators Expense Insurance Proposal
Form". On page 16 of
that document there is a heading "Estimated Exposure" under which there appears
the following "We estimate that
the exposure of ASIA for each of the following
is as follows" and then relevantly paragraph 4 in particular "Further likely
bank
guarantee for further security for costs for the Respondent: $250,000.00".

<P>

67   	That document is signed by P M Walker, Liquidator, and is
dated 29 January 1999.
<P>

68   	It is not clear whether that document was prepared or seen
at the time Mr Kemp wrote his letter on 5 January but, in any event,
Mr Curtis
submits Mr Kemp conducted himself in a way which, entitles the defendants to
have their costs paid on an indemnity basis.
Those grounds include the fact
that the plaintiff persisted, until last Friday 28 May 1999, with a case it
knew was hopeless and
bound to fail.
<P>

69   	A letter written on 14 May 1999 which was exhibited before
Rolfe J on 26 May 1999 has been handed to me. It is submitted that
the
plaintiff has proceeded knowing that it was bound to fail in its resistance to
the application.
<P>

70   	The last matter to which Mr Curtis refers is troubling
because he submitted that the plaintiff's solicitor, Mr Kemp, is "not
to be
believed".  He submitted that Mr Kemp knew that there was a likelihood of an
order for security being made and yet he had suggested
in his letter of 5
January 1999 that the need for security had been obviated. 
<P>

71   	It seems to me that Mr Kemp had a view that the further
security was obviated which resulted from an analysis of the funding
arrangements that had been apparently secured by 5 January.
<P>

72   	There is nothing before me other than the statement in the
liquidator's document signed some weeks after Mr Kemp's letter
that could have
any bearing on Mr Kemp's truthfulness. Indeed it seems to me that the
submission is without foundation because Mr
Kemp may have honestly believed
that the need had been obviated.  As it turned out five months down the track
that view was not able
to be supported.
<P>

73   	I am not of the view that Mr Kemp is to be disbelieved
when he says something to his opponents and, in the circumstances,
I need not
consider that aspect of the defendant's submissions any further.
<P>

74   	Further, the conduct of this litigation to date has been a
little unsatisfactory. It seems to me there could have been much
more economy
taken on board by the plaintiffs if they had addressed their minds to the
issues which led to the withdrawal of all
their evidence except for that of Mr
Robinson. Mr Dempsey's approach to that course of conduct is that it was really
a matter that
needed to be looked at very carefully because it was a matter of
some sensitivity that Mr Enfield's legal opinion needed to be precluded
from
the gaze of the defendant's solicitors. Be that as it may, the conduct that Mr
Kemp had engaged in by disclosing those documents
on 7 May must have alerted
the plaintiffs to the fact that a waiver argument was in the wings as was
referred to on 26 May 1999 before
Rolfe J.
<P>

75   	It seems to me that Rolfe J gave the clearest of
indications that the plaintiff would have some difficulty in securing the
secrecy to Mr Einfeld's opinion had it proceeded with its application. 
<P>

76   	I am of the view that that much of the hearing before me
was unnecessary particularly having regard to the assistance that
the plaintiff
could have gleaned from Rolfe J's opinion expressed prima facie at page 5 of
his judgment.
<P>

77   	I am minded then to award the costs on an indemnity basis
only insofar as they relate to the costs incurred on 26 May 1999,
and for fifty
percent of the costs incurred on 28 May 1999. I do so award costs on that
basis. The balance of the costs of this application
are to be paid by the
plaintiff on an ordinary basis.
<P>
