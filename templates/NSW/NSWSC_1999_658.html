<b><u>004463/97 PETER RODGERS IN THEIR CAPACITY AS LIQUIDATORS OF PRANX
LEISUREWEAR PTY LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) &amp; ANOR v RUMORTEX PTY LTD</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  In this matter the plaintiff, as liquidator of
Pranx Leisurewear Pty Ltd, seeks to recover from the defendant,
Rumortex Pty
Ltd, the sum of $36,000 on the basis that the six payments of $6,000 which
constitute that amount are insolvent transactions
and unfair preferences in the
winding up of Pranx.  It is not suggested that they are not unfair preferences
if the plaintiff is
otherwise entitled to success.
<P>

2   	Pranx was placed in administration on 6 February 1997 and
an order for winding up was made on 5 March 1997.  The relation back
period is
to 6 August 1996.
<P>

3   	Rumortex, which is a Victorian company, supplied goods to
Pranx between September 1995 and October 1995 to the value of $66,451.72.
 It
obtained default judgment for debt in the County Court of Victoria for
$71,182.32 on 14 May 1996.
<P>

4   	An application was made to the Registrar of the court for
an order for payment by instalments, the instalments offered being
$6,000 per
month.  The first payment, as I understand it, was to be made on 11 or 12
August 1996.
<P>

5   	Mr McCaskill, the managing director of Rumortex, opposed
the making of the instalment order.  He did so because he believed
that Pranx
could pay more.
<P>

6   	The basis on which the order was sought, and presumably
made, was that Pranx had insufficient liquidity and resources to satisfy
the
judgment in lump sum form.  The application was supported by an affidavit of
the solicitor, Mr Bullard, acting for Pranx, who
deposed that the position of
the company had improved since 30 June 1995, and the directors believed that
the turnover had increased
and the gross profit margin had improved, and the
directors had injected funds into the company of about $150,000 to enable it to
improve its balance sheet and clear debts, and that it had orders to the value
of $600,000 to be delivered during July and August
1996.
<P>

7   	That affidavit also evidenced a debt due to Stretch-Tex Pty
Ltd which was the subject of a statutory demand in respect of which
arrangements had been made for payment by instalments.
<P>

8   	It must, I think, be assumed that the Registrar accepted
all of this, although one would have to think he took an optimistic
view in
doing so.  
<P>

9   	It is accepted that the company was insolvent in the early
part of 1996 and on 6 February 1996.
<P>

10   	The result of this is that it will be presumed to be
insolvent during the period during which the payments in question were
made
pursuant to s 588E(3) of the Corporations Law.  The only result of that is that
the onus shifts to Rumortex if it wishes to
show that the company was not
insolvent at the time any one of the payments the subject of challenge was
made.  There is, of course,
also a defence available under s 588FG(2) if it can
be established that Rumortex was a party to the payments in good faith, and
that
at that time, meaning at the time of each payment, had no reasonable
grounds for suspecting the company was insolvent or would become
insolvent, and
that a reasonable person in the position of Rumortex would have no such
grounds, and valuable consideration was given
for the transaction impugned.
<P>

11   	It is not suggested that there is a lack of good faith or
that there is a lack of valuable consideration.  Thus for Rumortex
to make out
that defence it would have to prove that it came within s 588FG(2)(b)(i) and
(ii).
<P>

12   	Mr Rodgers is the liquidator of the company and there can
be no doubt that at the time of the winding up it was hopelessly
insolvent
insofar as having an excess of liabilities over assets is concerned and having
had an excess of current liabilities over
current assets.
<P>

13   	It is also true, as Mr Rodgers has pointed out, that the
position was deteriorating between 30 June 1995 and 30 June 1996
up to the date
of winding up.  In fact between 1995 and 1996 it seems to have been necessary
to support the company by the injection
of a further $150,000 into its loan
funds to enable it to pay its way, those moneys having been introduced, it
seems, by the directors.
 Thus it is perfectly clear that unless the directors
continued to support the company it was hopelessly insolvent at any time after
30 June 1995.
<P>

14   	There is evidence in an affidavit of Mr Rodgers sworn 4
May 1999 of a history of problems at least in the early part of 1996,
but that
is not a matter of any substantial importance as it is clear, in my view, that
at least at 30 June 1996 the company was
insolvent and, in fact, it has itself
said so and relied upon that to obtain the order for payment by instalments.
The evidence of
Mr Rodgers as to the position after that date is not so strong.
There are various occasions when petrol bills, electricity bills
and telephone
bills were paid a few days outside the due dates.  There is, however, nothing
to show that there would not have been
sufficient funds to pay those particular
accounts within the due dates and I do not think that anything turns on
that.
<P>

15   	There are, however, some other accounts, particularly one
in respect of goods supplied by STU Textiles on what was, apparently,
a cash on
delivery basis which remained outstanding albeit that the company had continued
to supply, and there are a number of other
accounts with amounts overdue from
1995, yet trading continued and payments for goods delivered continued to be
made.
<P>

16   	The position of the company was that it received nearly
all income received in the year in the period between about August
and December
in that year.  It received a little bit in January, according to Mr Rodgers,
and practically no income at all from February
to June.  It would seem on that
basis that at some stage during the period, probably in the months before
Christmas 1996, when the
directors were aware of the income the company was
likely to receive during that period and the expenses which would be incurred
in the five months up to 30 June 1997, that it became starkly apparent that
there was no possibility of the company continuing to
trade.  It was for that
reason that the directors decided to withdraw their support and not continue to
fund the company thereby
ensuring its winding up.
<P>

17   	The defendant, having the onus of showing that at the time
some of the payments were made the company was not insolvent, really
has little
to rely on except the fact that during most of the period the company had funds
in its bank account in credit and that
is a position which is, to say the
least, unusual in matters of this kind where very often bank accounts are shown
to be overdrawn.
<P>

18   	Had it not been for the support given by the directors
after June 1996, I would find the company was insolvent and unable
to pay its
debts and its likely future debts as they fell due, but in view of the support
which was given after that period and the
fact that the company did continue to
pay the bulk of its creditors I am unable to find that it was not able to pay
those creditors
as they fell due and, I suppose, as there is a presumption in
favour of insolvency I should find the reverse and find that during
that period
the company was able to pay its creditors as they fell due.  That could not
apply to the time when the original instalment
order was sought.  The reason
for that, in my view, is that it is admitted and has not been shown to be
otherwise, that at that time
the company could not pay.
<P>

19   	It follows from this that the first payment which was made
must be considered to be one made at a time when it has not been
established to
my satisfaction that the company was not insolvent but, so far as payments
received after that date are concerned,
I consider that the defendant has
satisfied the onus it is required to bear, in that during all the time up to
the last payment the
evidence is that the company was trading and was paying
its creditors, albeit on the last day or shortly thereafter, and at most
times
had surplus moneys in the bank or moneys which, at least, it considered were
available to it and were not required to pay any
creditor who was unduly
pressing.  I consider that so far as those payments are concerned that the
company has not been shown to
be insolvent at that time.
<P>

20   	I should add that it is my view even if that were not the
position, that apart from the first payment the defendant has established
the
defence which I mentioned under s588FG(2).  The reason for that is that while
the first ordered payment was received at a time
when there must have been some
doubt about whether or not the company would be able to maintain or to make
payments, even though
it had satisfied the Registrar of the Victorian County
Court that it could, the other payments were all made, as I understand it,
some
days earlier than required under the terms of the agreement by a company with
which at that time the defendant had no other
business dealings.  Thus the
defendant on receipt of these payments could properly conclude that the company
making the payments
was trading at least reasonably as it said it would do in
the affidavit which grounded its instalment order.
<P>

21   	I do not think that it should be said that, whichever
subsection one considers the matter under, but considering (ii) as being
the
more onerous, that a reasonable person in the position of Rumortex receiving
moneys under a court order obtained on the basis
that if that order was
obtained the judgment debtor would be able to discharge its liabilities, should
think or have grounds for
suspecting that when it received those payments the
company making them was insolvent or would become insolvent.
<P>

22   	Thus I find that the plaintiff is entitled to succeed in
respect of the $6,000 payment made on 6 August 1996 which should
be declared to
be an insolvent transaction and unfair preference with an order for payment of
that amount to the liquidator, but
otherwise the summons should be dismissed.

<P>

23   	I should add that in my view a preference claim for
$36,000 should not be heard in this court.  I said that at the directions
hearing and I say it again.  That claim is within the jurisdiction of the Local
Court of New South Wales and that is the court where
these claims ought to be
brought unless there is some special reason why they should not be so brought.
There is nothing so outstandingly
difficult about this claim which justifies it
having been brought in this court.  
<P>

24   	I declare that the payment of $6,000 made to the defendant
by Pranx Leisurewear Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) on 6 August 1996
was an insolvent
transaction void against the plaintiffs.  I order that the defendant pay the
sum of $6,000 together with interest
at court rates from 19 May 1997.
<P>

25   	&lt;COUNSEL ADDRESSED ON COSTS
<P>

26   	I order that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs and,
in my view, their costs should be no more than the costs which would
be
obtained on similar proceedings in the Local Court.  The defendant has stated
that it would be prepared for me to make an order
in an amount of $4,000 and
the plaintiff has accepted that.  In my view that is an amount which is
reasonably generous towards the
plaintiff.  In those circumstances I propose to
make that order.  I order that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs assessed
by
agreement as $4,000.  Exhibits may be returned.
