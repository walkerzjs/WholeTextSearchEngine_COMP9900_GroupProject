COMMON LAW DIVISION
<P>

MASTER MALPASS
<P>

TUESDAY 14 DECEMBER 1999
<P>

<u>11137/1999</u>	<u>COMMONWEALTH DEVELOPMENT BANK OF AUSTRALIA LIMITED v
DOUGLAS KEITH TYLER</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The defendant is the owner of a farm property (the property).  On
or about 28 February 1996 he gave a mortgage over the property
to the
plaintiff.  He received an advance in the sum of $535,000.  Largely, the
transaction was of a re-financing nature.  The sum
of $525,000 was used to
repay an existing indebtedness.  A sum of about $8,000 was used to discharge
other liabilities (council rates).
 The balance of about $2,000 was used for
working capital.
<P>

2  	There was default under the mortgage.  In December 1998 there was
a farm mediation.  It led to an agreement between the parties.
 There has been
default by the defendant under that agreement.
<P>

3  	These proceedings were commenced by Statement of Claim filed on
13 May 1999.  The plaintiff seeks inter alia a judgment for
possession and a
judgment in a monetary sum.  The claim for relief is founded on default under
the mortgage.  A Defence was filed
on 10 August 1999.
<P>

4  	On 8 October 1999, the plaintiff brought a Notice of Motion
seeking summary judgment.  The application for summary judgment
was heard on 3
December 1999.
<P>

5  	The plaintiff relies on three affidavits and tendered
documentation.  Save as to affidavits sworn to verify pleadings, the defendant
has not placed any affidavit or oral evidence before the court.
<P>

6  	The defendant no longer relies on the filed Defence.  He seeks to
rely on a proposed Amended Defence (Exhibit 1).
<P>

7  	The approach to be taken in summary judgment applications was not
in issue.  The authorities establish that this discretionary
remedy should be
granted only in what may be described as clear cases (<u>Webster v Lampard
</u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20598" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 598).</a>  The onus rests with the plaintiff.
<P>

8  	The filed Defence had denied on oath questions of indebtedness,
demand and non-payment.  The proposed Amended Defence makes
admissions
concerning questions of indebtedness, demand and non-payment.  There is dispute
as to the quantum of indebtedness.  It
is conceded that there is principal
repayable but there is no agreement as to the quantum thereof.  Save as to the
new material raised
in the proposed Amended Defence, the plaintiff's claim for
possession is not in dispute.  These new matters go to interest and not
principal payable under the mortgage.
<P>

9  	The proposed Amended Defence is a document of some length.  It
comprises 24 paragraphs.  Paragraphs 1 to 9 contain admissions.
 The new
material may be found in paragraphs 10 to 24.
<P>

10  	I shall now refer to some of the material contained in the
proposed Amended Defence.  As a pleading, it has its shortcomings.
 I shall
merely refer to some of the problems.  It pleads material that does not throw
up any defence to the plaintiff's claim. 
There is a lack of causal connection
in related allegations.  There is a lack of particularity.  There is a lack of
precise formulation
in relation to relief sought by the defendant.
<P>

11  	Broadly speaking, it was said to raise defences under the
<u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fdma1994163/" class="autolink_findacts">Farm Debt Mediation Act</u> 1994</a> (the Act), the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</u>
1980</a> and by way of estoppel.
<P>

12  	Paragraph 10 alleges that the plaintiff held itself out as an
expert in advising upon the suitability of the terms and conditions
of rural
loans and the types of farming and grazing activities which should be
undertaken in the light of the terms and conditions
of rural loans.  It alleges
that the plaintiff did advise the defendant as to the suitability of the terms
and conditions of the
loan and that the defendant should arrange to let out a
substantial section of the property for the sowing of potato crops.  There
is
the allegation that the plaintiff knew that the defendant would rely on the
plaintiff's advice and did so rely.  There are allegations
as to the personal
circumstances of the defendant and that these circumstances were known to the
plaintiff (one of the matters was
a claim for damages against Custom Credit
Corporation (CCC) and that the defendant had no apparent means of paying in
full his indebtedness
to the plaintiff without moneys from CCC).
<P>

13  	Paragraph 11 alleges that the defendant acted on the advice and
entered into the loan and mortgage transaction and sought to
arrange for the
sowing of potatoes on the property.
<P>

14  	Paragraph 12 alleges that the advice was unsound, negligent
and/or reckless as it exposed the defendant to substantial risk
and a high
degree of vulnerability.
<P>

15  	Paragraph 13 alleges certain events said to have happened since
the entering into the loan and mortgage.  One of the events
was the non
recovery of any moneys from CCC.  Another was that other persons had caused
road closures making potato farming impracticable.
<P>

16  	Paragraph 14 alleges an implied term of the loan transaction
that the plaintiff would not demand payment of the loan until
after the
defendant had received moneys from CCC.
<P>

17  	Paragraph 15 is expressed to be an alternative.  It makes an
allegation of unconscionability.  Paragraph 16 is expressed to
be an
alternative to paragraphs 14 and 15.  It alleges an implied term that any
demand must be reasonable.  Paragraph 17 is expressed
to be in the alternative
to paragraph 16.  It makes an allegation of unconscionability.
<P>

18  	Paragraph 18 alleges that the purported mediation was not a
mediation of the type contemplated by the Act and claims a declaration
that a
certificate purportedly given under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11</a> is a nullity.
<P>

19  	Paragraph 19 alleges that the defendant was prevented from
earning income from the cropping of potatoes by virtue of the conduct
of others
and the plaintiff's refusal of a request (to assist in the endeavour to cause
the road to be opened) made to it by the
defendant.  Paragraph 20 is a further
allegation of unconscionable conduct.
<P>

20  	Paragraph 21 specifically raises the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act</u>
1980</a> and expresses a general claim for relief under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2</a> thereof.
<P>

21  	Paragraph 22 alleges an implied representation that the
plaintiff would not rely on the legal rights created by the loan contract
whilst the defendant had not received any moneys from CCC.
<P>

22  	The position of the defendant is beset by a number of
difficulties.  Certain are insurmountable.  There is an evidentiary problem.
Despite having the opportunity to do so, he has not placed before the court
either affidavit or oral evidence deposing to the factual
material upon which
the alleged defences are founded.  There is authority for the proposition that
the verifying affidavit does not
perform this function.  It affords a very
limited evidentiary role.  The defendant's evidentiary problems are compounded
by the plaintiff
having adduced evidence which stands in conflict with
allegations made in the proposed pleading (including correspondence written
by
the then solicitor for the defendant containing admissions, promises to pay and
a request to lease part of the property for potato
production). At the very
least, there is no precise offer or undertaking from the defendant to repay
principal moneys (by way of
condition to the granting of relief).  It is not
suggested that the defendant has resources other than the secured property
itself
from which repayment can be made (indeed, it appears that he does not
have such resources).  It is merely suggested, in the most
general terms by
counsel, that the court should fashion relief which is restricted to the
interest component of the claim and as
to time and terms for repayment of the
principal.  This is put forward by way of submission in the context that it is
not disputed
that he has had the benefit of principal and a liability to
repay.
<P>

23  	It is not necessary to engage in the exercise of dealing
individually with each and every of the many allegations made in the
proposed
pleading in the light of the relevant law.  On the material before the court
(or the lack of it in the case of the defendant)
the proposed new matters of
defence are doomed to failure.
<P>

24  	In my view, the plaintiff has demonstrated that the proposed
defences to the claim for possession are hopeless.  I am satisfied
that this is
one of the clear cases in which summary relief may be granted.
<P>

25  	There will be judgment for the plaintiff for possession of the
property described in paragraph 1 of the Statement of Claim.
 The defendant is
to pay the costs of the Notice of Motion to date.  If it be necessary, I will
hear submissions on questions of
quantification of the indebtedness and the
issue of a Writ for Possession.
