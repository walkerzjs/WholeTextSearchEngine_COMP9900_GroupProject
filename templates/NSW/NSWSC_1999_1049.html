FRIDAY 22 OCTOBER 1999
<P>

<b>4083/99 - EAGLE HOMES PTY LTD v LED BUILDERS PTY LTD</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	On 2 September this year, the defendant LED served a statutory
demand under the Corporations Law on the plaintiff Eagle Homes,
requiring
payment of $796,645.  On 22 September 1999, Eagle Homes filed a summons in this
Court seeking to set aside that statutory
demand pursuant to s.459G of the
Corporations Law.  This summons came before me yesterday, 21 October 1999, and
I heard an application
by Eagle Homes for an adjournment of the summons, which
was contested by LED.  It is common ground that if the adjournment is refused,
the summons should be dismissed.
<P>

2  	I will start with a brief history of the matter.  
<P>

3  	On 26 August this year, LED obtained an order in the Federal
Court against Eagle Homes for payment of $796,645.  The statutory
demand to
which I have referred required payment of that judgment debt.
<P>

4  	On 14 September 1999, Eagle Homes filed a notice of appeal from
the Federal Court order, and on 22 September 1999 filed the
summons in this
Court, made returnable on 22 October 1999.
<P>

5  	On 27 September 1999, LED filed a notice of motion in these
proceedings, returnable on 11 October 1999, to have the summons
heard on that
day.  
<P>

6  	On 6 October 1999, Eagle Homes filed a notice of motion in the
Federal Court, returnable on 14 October seeking a stay of the
Federal Court
order.
<P>

7  	On 11 October 1999, the summons in these proceedings was
adjourned by consent to 18 October, pending the outcome of the stay
application.  
<P>

8  	On 14 October 1999, the stay application came before Beaumont J
in the Federal Court.  It was conceded by LED that the appeal
raised
substantial questions.  However, Beaumont J did not grant a stay, but stood the
stay application over to 19 October 1999,
the day after the adjourned date of
the summons in this Court. It appears that the main factors influencing his
Honour were that
in his view, the fate of steps being taken to wind up Eagle
Homes should be determined by the Supreme Court, and that as a matter
of comity
the Federal Court should not interfere in that process.  His Honour may also
have been influenced by the consideration
that there was no occasion to grant a
stay when no enforcement of the order in the Federal Court was in
contemplation.
<P>

9  	On 18 October in this Court, Deputy Registrar Howe stood over the
summons in these proceedings to 21 October, giving reasons
to the effect that
he did not see judicial comity as preventing the Federal Court deciding the
stay application.
<P>

10  	On 19 October 1999, the stay application was again before
Beaumont J.  He adhered to his previous approach, stood the application
over
generally, and granted leave to Eagle Homes  to appeal from his order of that
day and his order of 14 October 1999.  Pursuant
to that leave, on 21 October
1999 Eagle Homes filed a notice of appeal to the Full Federal Court from those
orders.
<P>

11  	The matter came before me pursuant to the adjournment ordered by
Deputy Registrar Howe.
<P>

12  	Mr Wood for Eagle Homes submitted that I should adjourn the
proceedings until the appeal from the orders made by Beaumont J
had been heard
by the Full Federal Court, or at least for sufficient time to allow an urgent
application to be brought in the Federal
Court for a stay pending determination
of that appeal.
<P>

13  	He submitted that three questions of principle were involved.
First, that applications for the stay of an order should be heard
and
determined by the court which made the order.  Secondly, that it was not a
ground for refusal of an application for a stay that
no enforcement procedure
was threatened in the particular court that had made the order, where the order
was causing detriment to
the applicant in other ways.  Thirdly, that in cases
such as this, the failure to grant a stay for all practical purposes determined
the fate of winding up proceedings.
<P>

14  	He submitted that, in the absence of a stay, it was not really
left in the control of the Supreme Court to determine whether
the winding up
should proceed.  In the absence of a stay, it was clearly established that
there could be no genuine dispute within
the meaning of s.459H of the
Corporations Law, so that any summons to set aside the statutory demand would
have to be dismissed:
 see<b> </b><u>Barclays Australia (Finance) Ltd v Mike
Gaffikin Marine Pty Ltd</u> (1996) 22 ACSR 235.  Likewise, there would be no
possible defence to consequent winding up proceedings.
<P>

15  	Mr Leeming for LED submitted that this application involved
calling into question a judgment of the Federal Court.  He submitted
that this
Court should give full faith and credit to the Federal Court decision not to
grant a stay.  He submitted that it was plain
that there was no genuine dispute
as to the existence or amount of the debt, either at the time of the notice, or
at the time of
expiry of the notice, or today:  the adjournment was sought
merely in the hope that it may come about some time in the future that
there
will be a genuine dispute about the debt.  He submitted that that was not a
ground on which to grant an adjournment.
<P>

16  	Mr Leeming also submitted that there had been delay in the
matter by Eagle Homes which would count against an adjournment being
granted.
It had not sought a stay of the Federal Court order before the statutory demand
was made, or when it appealed from the order.
 It had left it to the last
possible day to file the summons to set aside the statutory demand.  It had not
sought a temporary stay
pending the hearing of the appeal from the orders of
Beaumont J.
<P>

17  	On the merits of the matter, Mr Leeming pointed to evidence
concerning detriment that would be caused to LED by any further
delay.  The
proceedings which gave rise to the Federal Court order had been commenced on 28
October 1993. An application for a Mareva
injunction was brought in the Federal
Court, and in that application there was evidence of a  dividend of $400,000
paid to directors
of Eagle Homes in the year ended 30 June 1994, recorded in
company documents as having been paid on 1 July 1993.  The judge hearing
the
application considered that there was a substantial possibility, at least, that
the dividend had not in fact been paid until
after the commencement of the
proceedings, that is after 28 October 1993.
<P>

18  	Next Thursday, 28 October 1999, would be exactly six years after
the commencement of the proceedings.  Depending upon exactly
when the dividend
was paid, a limitation period of six years would be expiring some time after 28
October 1999.  Just when, it was
impossible to say; but any delay plainly
involved steadily increasing risk to the plaintiff that any claim that might be
brought
by a liquidator of the company in relation to that dividend would be
statute-barred.  Mr Leeming also indicated that LED would agree
to withdraw the
winding up process if the amount of the judgment was appropriately secured.
<P>

19  	In my opinion, it would not be appropriate to express a view as
to whether or not Beaumont J was correct in the decision he
made.  However, it
does seem to me that there are some matters which were apparently not put to
him in argument, and which are not
discussed in his reasons.
<P>

20  	First, it does appear that cases such as<b> </b><u>Barclays</u>
have the consequence that where the Federal Court has given a judgment for a
money sum against a company, and that company does not
pay or appropriately
secure that sum, the obtaining or failure to obtain a stay from the Federal
Court will for all practical purposes
determine the fate of moves to wind up
that company. <b> </b><u>Barclays</u> shows that, without a stay, there cannot
be a genuine dispute as to the existence or amount of the debt within s.459H of
the Corporations
Law; and also I think that the existence of an appeal against
an unstayed judgment cannot be "some other reason why the demand should
be set
aside" within the meaning of s.459J of the Corporations Law.  Furthermore, it
seems clear that, if a summons to wind up is
filed following failure to comply
with a statutory demand, the existence of an appeal against an unstayed
judgment could not possibly
prevent the making of a winding up order.  For that
reason, it does seem that, for all practical purposes, declining to grant a
stay
in the Federal Court would determine the result in the Supreme Court, no
less than would the grant of a stay.
<P>

21  	The second matter not explicitly discussed by Beaumont J is that
the only substantial discretion the Supreme Court would have
would be to
adjourn either the summons to set aside the statutory notice, or the winding up
proceedings. However, for the Supreme
Court to adjourn either proceedings until
after determination of the appeal from the Federal Court judgment would I think
be plainly
wrong, for two reasons.  It would have the effect of precluding the
successful party in the Federal Court proceedings from perhaps
the most
effective means of enforcing its judgment, and thus would in substance amount
to a stay of the Federal Court judgment granted
by another court.  In addition,
it would involve the indefinite adjournment of proceedings in which, at the
time of commencement
and at the time of adjournment, the judgment creditor was
plainly  entitled to succeed, based purely on the possibility that there
might
in the future be a change of circumstances which would take away that
entitlement.
<P>

22  	On the other hand, in deciding whether or not to stay its own
judgment, the Federal Court has a complete discretion and can
take into account
all circumstances including the pros and cons of the company being wound up,
including the possibility that this
might put an end to the appeal.
<P>

23  	Those consideration would seem to support the view that, in
cases such as this, the Federal Court should normally hear and
determine a stay
application, and that the lack of any threat of enforcement by the processes of
the Federal Court itself may not
be a sufficient reason to decline to consider
or grant a stay.  In this regard I would mention that there are other
circumstances
in which a stay might be granted, even though there is no threat
of enforcement through the processes of the court making the order,
as for
example in cases where an injunction has been granted.
<P>

24  	Although for reasons I have given it would, in my opinion, be
wrong to stand these proceedings over until the appeal from the
money judgment
has been determined, there is a question whether I should grant a short
adjournment until the appeal from Beaumont
J has been determined, or at least
until Eagle Homes can apply in the Federal Court for a stay pending
determination of that appeal.
<P>

25  	If I grant any adjournment, it could prejudice LED in relation
to the expiry of a limitations period.  On its case, the risk
begins on 28
October 1999.  The risk might be considered slight at first, but it would
steadily increase.
<P>

26  	It seems to me that Eagle Homes could provide some protection
against that risk if the recipients of the $400,000 entered into
a binding
agreement that, if the company was wound up and proceedings later commenced
against them, they would not take the benefit
in support of any limitation
defence of any lapse of time between now and the winding up order.  There may
be a question whether
limitation protection, particularly that given by the
Corporations Law itself, can be waived; but it seems to me that a binding
contractual
agreement could be made that would put the plaintiff in any such
proceedings in the position it would have been if that time had
not elapsed.
No such agreement is offered, nor is any security for the debt or any part of
it offered.
<P>

27  	If I do not grant an adjournment and the winding up proceeds,
then this could plainly cause prejudice to Eagle Homes, in that
the liquidator
may not pursue the appeal against the Federal Court money judgment, and also it
may not pursue another case in the
Federal Court in which Eagle Homes has
obtained a judgment which still needs to be quantified.  Against this, there is
the consideration
that, if the liquidator is appropriately funded and protected
against any liability for costs, and if the appeal and the other proceedings
have merit, it could be expected that a liquidator acting reasonably would
pursue those matters.
<P>

28  	If I refuse the adjournment and proceed to dismiss the summons,
then under s.459F (2) (a) (ii) Eagle Homes would have another
seven days before
failure to comply with the  statutory demand occurred.   It would be open to
Eagle Homes within that seven days
to seek from the Federal Court a stay of the
judgment, either as a fresh application based on the fresh circumstances
constituted
by this judgment, or alternatively pending hearing the appeal from
Beaumont J.  In my opinion, if the plaintiff did obtain a stay
of the judgment
during that seven days, then, notwithstanding that there would follow, if the
amount is not paid, failure to comply
with a statutory notice and the
consequent deemed insolvency, it would be an abuse of process for LED then to
seek to wind up Eagle
Homes on the basis of the judgment debt that had been
stayed.
<P>

29  	Section 459S of the Corporations Law prevents the company
without the leave of the court opposing an application to wind up
the company,
based on failure to comply with a statutory demand, on any ground relied on for
the purpose of an application for the
demand to be set aside, or on which the
company could have relied in such an application.  There is an exception in
cases where the
leave of the court is obtained, but leave can only be granted
on a ground material to proving that the company is solvent.
<P>

30  	In my opinion, a stay of a judgment obtained after an
application to set aside a statutory demand has been dismissed, but before
winding up proceedings are commenced, would not be a ground either relied on by
the company in the application or a ground on which
the company could have
relied.  It would in my opinion be an abuse of process for the creditor to
commence winding up proceedings
on the basis of that judgment debt and the non
compliance with the statutory demand, when the judgment had been stayed.
<P>

31  	There is also the consideration that the current time
constraints are to some extent due to delays by Eagle Homes, although
it cannot
be said that those delays are very great.
<P>

32  	Taking all these considerations into account, in my opinion the
appropriate course is to refuse the adjournment and to dismiss
the summons.  I
will however give consideration to whether either that order should be itself
stayed for a very short period, or
whether the period of seven days for
compliance should be extended for a short period, to make certain that Eagle
Homes does have
sufficient time to make a further application for a stay in the
Federal Court.
