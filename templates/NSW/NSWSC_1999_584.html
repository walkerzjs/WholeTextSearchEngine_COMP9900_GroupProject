<b>1973/97	GLENN WOODS &amp; ANOR v DESRE CLAIR WOODS &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

His Honour:
<P>

1   	Previously I have granted for short finite periods relief
of a Mareva nature in these proceedings.  The first defendant now
moves for
further relief of a Mareva nature.  The facts of the matter shortly are that I
have delivered a substantive judgment in
these proceedings in which I have
found that there is a binding contract between the first defendant and the
plaintiffs under which
the first defendant is entitled to continue to occupy a
property in Waite Street Bateau Bay.  The first defendant originally claimed
specific performance of that contract but now seeks to argue that she should
have damages in lieu of specific performance.  This
claim the plaintiffs resist
on the basis that, although in the hearing that has taken place they denied the
existence of the contract
in defence of the claim for specific performance,
they have not to date committed any breach of the contract which would sound in
damages.  That argument remains to be heard.  The evidence before me shows that
the total amount of the damages sought and the costs
of the proceedings would
not exceed but might approximate $200,000.
<P>

2   	The plaintiffs own three pieces of real estate, the Waite
Street property already mentioned, and two other properties, one
at 10 Carbeen
Road Wamberal, which is their home, and the other property at 224 Cresthaven
Avenue Bateau Bay.  This lastmentioned
property they have proceeded to sell
secretively at this stage of the proceedings, that contract originally being
for settlement
on 28 May 1999, but settlement having been delayed by reason of
the injunctions that I have already granted.  When I say they have
done this
secretively, the evidence shows that they have refused to give any information
concerning their financial affairs, or the
destination of the net proceeds of
some $170,000 from the sale of the Cresthaven Avenue property.  This refusal
was recently repeated
in Court on instructions by Mr Harry Woods, their
solicitor.  Furthermore, upon enquiry being made of the real estate agent
through
whom the property was being sold, he refused to disclose the solicitors
acting on that sale (different from the solicitors acting
in the proceedings),
saying that he had specific instructions from the plaintiffs not to reveal this
matter.
<P>

3   	The result of my earlier grant of short term relief was  to
procure the filing in Court of an affidavit by the plaintiff Marcia
Woods (the
plaintiff Glenn Woods being said to be overseas on business), which set out
that the net proceeds of the Cresthaven Avenue
property, together with the
equity in the Waite Street property, would exceed the greatest amount to which
the first defendant would
possibly be entitled, so that Mareva relief was
unnecessary and unjustified.  However, that affidavit disingenuously omitted to
state
the amount of the plaintiffs' equity in the Carbeen Road property, which
is their matrimonial home; the financial state of affairs
of the company
through which the plaintiff Glenn Woods conducts his business; and, most
remarkably, the destination of the net proceeds
of sale of the Cresthaven
Avenue property or what was to be done with that money.  The evidence at trial
shows that the female plaintiff
Marcia Woods is of Singapore origin, and that
Glenn Woods travels frequently on business to Asia and has business dealings
and connexions
in Asia.  Marcia Woods has a brother who is qualified as a
lawyer in Singapore, although at present working as such in Sydney.  The
transmission of funds out of the country by people with these connexions is
obviously an easier and more commonplace matter than
in the case of people who
do not have overseas connexions or dealings.
<P>

4   	The criterion for Mareva relief laid down by Gleeson CJ in
<b>Patterson v BTR Engineering (Aust) Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2018%20NSWLR%20319" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 18 NSWLR 319</a> at 321 is as
follows:
<P>

"The remedy is discretionary, but it has been held that, in addition to any
other considerations that may be relevant in the circumstances
of a particular
case, as a general rule a plaintiff will need to establish, first, a prima
facie cause of action against the defendant,
and secondly, a danger that, by
reason of the defendant's absconding, or of assets being removed out of the
jurisdiction or disposed
of within the jurisdiction or otherwise dealt with in
some fashion, the plaintiff, if he succeeds, will not be able to have his
judgment
satisfied.  ..."
<P>

I am satisfied that both those matters are established in this case.  The
existence of the contract is established; costs estimated
at $50,000 have
already been ordered, and there is a prima facie case for damages.  The
plaintiffs' secretiveness and lack of candour
set out above, viewed in all the
circumstances of the case, lead the Court to the conclusion that there is a
danger that the first
defendant will not be able to have her judgment satisfied
unless the Court takes steps by way of Mareva relief to ensure the continued
availability of the funds flowing from the sale of the Cresthaven Avenue
property.  It is implicit in what I have said about the
lack of evidence on the
plaintiffs' behalf as to the destination of the proceeds of the Cresthaven
Avenue property that they have
shown no immediate need for the money or
inconvenience flowing to them through its being immobilized at the moment.
<P>

5   	I indicated in Court yesterday that I was prepared to grant
Mareva relief requiring the $170,000 to be paid into Court, or
placed in an
account to abide the further order of the Court, and the parties approached me
in private chambers yesterday afternoon
with orders that had been agreed
between them on this basis, and those orders were then made.  I indicated that
I should give reasons
for those orders in Court this morning, which I have now
done.
<P>
