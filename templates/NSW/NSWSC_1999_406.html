<P>

<b>JUDGMENT  No 1</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>
<P>

1	Constantine Georgiou and Bruce Malcolm Harrison are charged with the murder
of Rick de Stoop, Sasha Milenkovic and Michael Kulakowski
on 9 November 1997,
and with the attempted murder or Robin April David on the same occasion.  Mr
Georgiou has applied for a separate
trial.
<P>

2	The three deceased and Mr David were all members of the Bandido Outlaw Motor
Cycle Club, Mr Kulakowski being the Club's National
President and Mr Milenkovic
being the Club's Sergeant at Arms.  Mr Georgiou was a current member of the
Rebels Outlaw Motor Cycle
Club.  Mr Harrison was an associate of Mr Georgiou
and a former member of that Club.
<P>

3	The Crown case against the co-accused is as follows.  Mr Georgiou and Mr
Harrison acted in concert from beginning to end.  They
travelled to the Black
Market Caf&eacute; in Mr Georgiou's Porsche motor vehicle.  The deceased were
killed by gun shot wounds and
Mr David was wounded by gun shot.  The shooting
took place in a basement area of the Caf&eacute; which is not open to the
public.
 A Mr Culshaw, an off-duty doorman employed at the Caf&eacute; and a
current member of the Rebels Outlaw Motor Cycle Club, obtained
the keys to the
basement from the bar attendant.  The deceased, Mr Milenkovic, left the group
of people he was with for a short time
and, on returning, said to the deceased,
Mr Kulakowski, that Mr Culshaw and Mr Georgiou wanted to have a meeting with
them.  The
three deceased then left the people they were with and went towards
the door to the basement.  About five minutes later gunshots
were heard from
the basement.  Mr Georgiou was seen running from the basement door, followed by
Mr Harrison who was waving a gun.
 The two men ran from the Caf&eacute; and
were seen running along the street.  Mr Harrison was observed to have his right
hand down
the front of his trousers inside a long black overcoat as if
concealing something.  They ran to Mr Georgiou's Porsche.  Mr Georgiou
entered
the driver's side and Mr Harrison the passenger's side, and the vehicle was
driven off.  Police pursued the vehicle at high
speed and then at a safer
distance.  In Crown Street, a metal object was seen to be thrown from the
passenger window of the vehicle.
 It was recovered by the police and found to
be a Smith &amp; Wesson pistol.  A Baretta pistol was also located nearby.
Soon after,
the Porsche was located in Hutchinson Lane, Surry Hills.  Mr
Harrison was seen walking away from the vehicle.  He was apprehended,
broke
free, and was recaptured and handcuffed.  Mr Georgiou was not present.  A Mr
Spanakakis (who is charged with being an accessory
after the fact) and others
obtained a ticket for Mr Georgiou to travel by sea to Japan on the vessel
"Arafura".  On 3 February 1998
Mr Georgiou was apprehended on the vessel,
carrying a stolen passport, a driver's licence in a false name and a large
amount of cash.
 He was arrested.
<P>

4	The forensic evidence against Mr Harrison includes the following.  Mr
Harrison was found to have been shot in the left wrist.
 A pair of gloves found
on the front seat of the Porsche were stained with blood which could not be
excluded from having originated
from him.  DNA recovered from a .25 spent
bullet, found on the floor of the basement near the deceased, Mr De Stoop, was
very likely
to be from Mr Harrison.  DNA recovered from Mr Harrison's footwear
was very likely that of the deceased Mr De Stoop.
<P>

5	Forensic evidence against Mr Georgiou includes the following.  The Smith
&amp; Wesson pistol was purchased in 1990 and later given
to Mr Georgiou.
Photographs were found on Mr Georgiou's premises depicting him and others
holding pistols identical with the Smith
&amp; Wesson and Baretta pistols
recovered in Crown Street.  Premises depicted in those photographs were
searched and a number of
bullets and cartridges fired from the Smith &amp;
Wesson and Baretta pistols were recovered.  Four cartridge cases recovered from
the murder scene were fired from the Smith &amp; Wesson pistol.  Two damaged
bullets recovered from the murder scene were fired from
the same pistol.  A
bullet fragment was discharged from that pistol.  A damaged copper bullet
jacket and a damaged lead bullet core,
discharged from the Smith &amp; Wesson
pistol, were recovered from the body of the deceased, Mr Kulakowski.  
<P>

6	On 10 November 1997, the accused, Mr Harrison, participated in an
electronically recorded interview with the police, attended
by his barrister.
Relevantly, Mr Harrison said that he was driven to the Caf&eacute; by Mr
Georgiou in the Porsche, which was parked
in a street near the Caf&eacute; at a
point specified in a diagram drawn by Mr Harrison and annexed to the record of
the interview.
 Mr Harrison went on to give the following account of events.
When he arrived at the Cafe, Mr Harrison had been drinking and was
drunk.  Mr
Harrison went to the toilets and then to the cloakroom area.  He started taking
off his jacket when his hand was hit violently.
 Mr Georgiou had been out of
sight for only two minutes.  Mr Harrison went out of the Club.  He noticed that
his hand was injured
and saw blood coming from it.  Mr Georgiou grabbed him by
the elbow.  Mr Georgiou walked him to the Porsche.  Mr Harrison assumed
that Mr
Georgiou was going to take him to hospital.  They got in the car, Mr Georgiou
driving.  Mr Georgiou was driving fast.  He
said they had to get Mr Harrison to
hospital.  Mr Harrison denied throwing anything out of the vehicle and said he
did not recall
Mr Georgiou doing so.  He said he could not recall breaking free
when he was apprehended by the police.
<P>

7	At a joint trial, Mr Harrison will require the Crown to tender the electronic
record of the police interview and the sketch plan
showing where the Porsche
was allegedly parked.
<P>

8	Mr Georgiou has served a notice of alibi.  The witness statements provided
support his case that he was not at the Caf&eacute;
at the relevant time. 
<P>

9	The principles of criminal procedure relating to applications for a separate
trial are clearly established by the authorities.
 Where the facts constituting
the alleged offences have much in common, the interests of justice are best
served by a joint trial.
 That is particularly so where the Crown case is that
the accused were engaged in a common enterprise.  On the other hand, there
should be a separate trial if a joint trial would not be a fair trial.  In<i>
Middis</i>  (27 March 1991, unreported), Hunt J specified the way in which
these considerations are to be weighed, in a passage approved by
the Court of
Criminal Appeal in <i>Baartman</i> (6 October 1994, unreported) and
<i>Fernando</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/66.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCCA 66.</a>  He said:
<P>

	"Briefly, the relevant principles are that:
<P>

	(1)	Where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is
significantly weaker than and different to that admissible
against another or
the other accused to be jointly tried with him; and
<P>

	(2)	where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly
prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible
against him; and
<P>

	(3)	where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the
applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of
the prejudicial
material, a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges
against the applicant.  The applicant
must show that positive injustice would
be caused to him in a joint trial."
<P>

10	I am not persuaded that, in the present case, the evidence against the
applicant is significantly weaker than that against his
co-accused.  Much of
the evidence against Mr Georgiou and Mr Harrison will be the same, it being the
Crown case that they acted in
concert throughout.  Some of the evidence, as I
have indicated, will be different but it substantially the same case which the
Crown
will seek to prove against each of them.  
<P>

11	The tender of the electronic record of Mr Harrison's police interview would
be prejudicial to Mr Georgiou.  It has the potential
to cast a shadow over Mr
Georgiou's denial that he was present at the Caf&eacute; and over his alibi
evidence.  That, however, is
as far as the prejudice might go.  This is not a
case in which the co-accused implicates the applicant in the commission of the
crime
in an attempt to exculpate himself.  Mr Harrison did not purport to know,
in his interview, what Mr Georgiou was doing while he was
out of Mr Harrison's
sight.  Furthermore, the potential prejudice is capable of being specified in a
straightforward way.  A clear
and unequivocal instruction to the jury could be
formulated not to use the Harrison interview as evidence that Mr Georgiou was
present
at the Caf&eacute; or as evidence of anything done by him.
<P>

12	I do not assume that juries invariably implement instructions of that kind.
Such an assumption would preclude the grant of a
separate trial in every case
where evidence to be adduced against or in favour of a co-accused would be
potentially prejudicial to
the applicant.  The confidence which one would have
in such an instruction being followed will vary from case to case.  Where, as
in the present case, the potential prejudice is readily identifiable and can be
made the subject of an appropriate instruction in
a straightforward way, there
is reason to expect that a jury would understand and follow the instruction.
In such a case, there is
no serious risk that the case against the applicant
will be immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material.
<P>

13	Having regard to these considerations, I am not satisfied that the
applicant, Mr Georgiou, would suffer a positive injustice
in a joint trial.
The application should accordingly be refused.
<P>

14	The order I make is that the application for a separate trial is
dismissed.
