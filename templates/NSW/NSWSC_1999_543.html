<P>

<b>1485/99  -   T A TAYLOR &amp; SON P/L  -v-  RESEARCH &amp; APPLIED
TECHNOLOGIES PTY LTD</b>
<P>

<b> </b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b> </b>
<P>

1	MASTER: This is an application to set aside two statutory demands.  One is
dated 29 January 1999. It is for the sum of $37,332.21.
 The other is dated is
1 April 1999 and it is for the sum of $14,329.44.  It is a total of
$51,661.65.
<P>

2	     The application is in time and the summons was amended to include an
order to set side the second demand, which was after
commencement of the
proceedings.
<P>

3	     Basically in this matter Mr Palmer and Mr Taylor were shareholders in a
group of companies which were involved in a number
of different areas in the
building industry.  One area was waterproofing buildings and supplying
waterproofing membranes.
<P>

4	     A deed was entered into on 25 June 197 whereby the group of companies
was split up and each of Mr Palmer and Mr Taylor went
their separate ways.
<P>

5	     Mr Ross Taylor took the company T A Taylor &amp; Son Pty Ltd P/L, who is
the plaintiff. Mr John Taylor took the other companies,
which included inter
alia the defendant.
<P>

6	     The basis for setting side the demands is there are said to be
offsetting claims.  The claim arises out of a job which was
done by some
company in the group in 1993.  There was litigation and in due course that
litigation, which was against the plaintiff,
was settled for a sum of $165,000.
There were costs involved in the litigation which brought the amount of the
liability to $207,637.20.
 In these proceedings the insurers provided for a
payout of $100,000, which left a liability of $107,630.20.  One half of that
liability
is $53,818.60.  It is submitted that this liability maybe enforced by
the plaintiff against the defendant and, as it exceeds the
amounts of the
demands, should be set aside.
<P>

7	     The basis for the claim, which is the foundation of the offsetting
claim, arises out of the deed to which I have referred.
 That deed at the
commencement talks of the parties and indicates they are John Francis Palmer of
14 Aminya Street, Lane Cove ("John
Palmer") and Ross James Taylor of 99
Riverview Street, Lane Cove, in the said State ("Ross Taylor").
<P>

8	     There are a number of definitions in the deed which are important, and I
set out a number of the definitions in order to
make comprehensible the
comments which I will make later:
<P>

	"Palmer Group" means John Palmer, persons associated with John Palmer and any
companies in which John Palmer or any associates
of John Palmer have an
interest in either by shareholding or membership on the board of directors,
except for any such persons which
are also members of the T. A.  Taylor
Group;
<P>

	"RATS' means the partnership conducted by Ligon 155 and Ligon 156 and known as
Research and Applied Technologies having a business
address of 40 Robert
Street, Rozelle in the said State;
<P>

	"Partition Date" means 31 December 1996;
<P>

	"Son" means T. A. Taylor &amp; Son Pty Limited (ACN 000 482 897) having a
registered office at 40 Robert Street, Rozelle in the
said State;
<P>

	"T. A. Taylor Group" means each and all of Holdings, Son, Taylor Qld, Geoff
Maiden and RATS;
<P>

	"Taylor Group" means Ross Taylor, persons associated with Ross Taylor and any
companies in which Ross Taylor or any associates
of Ross Taylor have an
interest in either by way of shareholding or membership on the board of
directors, except for any such persons
which are also members of the T. A.
Taylor Group;
<P>

	1.3  Headings in this Agreement are for convenience only and do not affect its
interpretation or construction."
<P>

9	     The definition of "RATS" refers to a company, Ligon 156, and that
company is now the defendant in the proceedings. The agreement
in clause 1.3
provides that the headings are for convenience only and do not affect its
interpretation or construction.
<P>

10	     The principal provision appears in clause 2.1 and it is evident from
that clause the deed is intended to separate the operation
of the T A Taylor
group so that ultimately the T A Taylor will own the business conducted by the
plaintiff.  The Palmer group would
own the businesses conducted by other
companies and trusts.
<P>

11	     In clause 4.1 provision is made in respect of the effect of financial
arrangements and clause 4.2 refers to the fact that
the parties recognise that
one party takes greater share of the stock, plant and equipment but would also
take a greater share of
the liabilities.
<P>

12	     In this regard one should note that Recital A provides that Ross Taylor
and John Palmer, either directly or indirectly,
own in equal shares the T A
Taylor group.  In other words, the parties are moving from what might be viewed
as an equal holding to
splitting up the group in somewhat unequal proportions.
The relevant clause under which it is said the right to bring the offsetting
claim is clause 9. That clause is in the following terms:
<P>

	"9.  The parties remain equally liable to all claims and liabilities of any
nature which may arise in respect of the businesses
conducted by the T. A.
Taylor Group until the Partition Date."
<P>

13	     It can be seen that the first two words "the parties" is not an
expression which is defined in the deed which contains an
extensive definition
clause.  The immediate question which springs to mind is what is meant by that
and the deed certainly itself
makes it clear that the two individuals are
mentioned as parties to the deed.  There is also a release contained in
paragraphs 13
and 14. Those releases are in the following form:
<P>

	"Ross Taylor releases and discharges John Palmer and his associates from all
liability for damages or loss and from all sums of
money, accounts, actions,
proceedings, claims,  demands, costs and expenses whatever which Ross Taylor
has or had or at any time
in the future may have or have had against John
Palmer or an entity related to or an associate of John Palmer which arose in
respect
of the businesses conducted by the T. A. Taylor Group.
<P>

	John Palmer releases and discharges Ross Taylor and his associates from all
liability for damages or loss and from all sums of
money, accounts, actions,
proceedings, claims, demands, costs and expenses whatever which John Palmer has
or had or at any time in
the future may have or have had against Ross Taylor or
an entity related to or an associate of Ross Taylor which arose in respect
of
the businesses conducted by the T. A. Taylor Group."
<P>

14	     One thing that can be immediately noted about these is that each clause
uses the defined name, either being "Ross Taylor"
or "John Palmer", which comes
from the very commencing words when the parties were named and which have been
quoted above.
<P>

15	     The question which arises in part is whether there is in fact a genuine
dispute in respect of the construction or what I
will shortly refer to about
rectification.
<P>

16	     I have had the benefit of a number of submissions in respect of the
principles to be applied and I think probably the most
useful summation is that
given by McLelland CJ in Eq in<b> Eyota Pty Limited v Hanave Pty Limited</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2012%20ACLC%20669" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 12 ACLC 669.</a> At page 671 his Honour made the following comments in
respect of the expression "genuine dispute":
<P>

	"It is, however, necessary to consider the meaning of the expression `genuine
dispute' where it occurs in s 459H. In my opinion
that expression connotes a
plausible contention requiring investigation, and raises much the same sort of
considerations as the `serious
question to be tried' criterion which arises on
an application for an interlocutory injunction or for the extension or removal
of
a caveat.  This does not mean that the Court must accept uncritically as
giving rise to a genuine dispute, every statement in an
affidavit however
equivocal, lacking in precision, with undisputed contemporary documents or
other statements by the same deponent,
or inherently improbable in itself, it
may be' not having `sufficient prima facie plausibility  to merit further
investigation as
to (its) truth' (c/f<b> Eng Em Yon v Letchumanan</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20AC%20331" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) AC
331</a> at 341), or 'a patently feeble legal argument, or an assertion of facts
unsupported by evidence' (cf<b> South Australia v Wall</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%2024%20SASR%20189" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 24 SASR 189</a>
at 194).
<P>

	But it does mean that, except in such an extreme case, a Court required to
determine whether there is a genuine dispute should
not embark upon an inquiry
as to the credit of a witness or a deponent whose evidence is relied on as
giving rise to the dispute.
 There is a clear difference between, on the one
hand, determining whether there is a genuine dispute and, on the other hand,
determining
the merits of, or resolving, such a dispute.  In<b> Mibor
Investments</b> (at ACLC  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1066%20ACSR%20366%2d7" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1066; ACSR 366-7)</a> Hayne J said, after referring to the
state of the law prior to the enactment of Division 3 of Part 5.4 of the
Corporations Law, and
to the terms of Division 3:
<P>

		'These matters, taken in combination, suggest that at least in most cases, it
is not expected that the Court will embark  upon
any extended inquiry in order
to determine whether there is a genuine dispute between the parties and
certainly will not attempt
to weigh the merits of that dispute.  All that the
legislation requires is that the Court conclude that there is a dispute and
that
it is a genuine dispute.'
<P>

	In<b> Re Morris Catering (Australia) Pty Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACLC%20919" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11  ACLC 919</a> at
922;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACSR%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 ACSR 601</a> at 605 Thomas J said:
<P>

		'There is little doubt that Division 3... Prescribes a formula that requires
the Court to assess the position between the parties,
and preserve demands
where it can be seen that there is no genuine dispute and no sufficient genuine
offsetting claim.  That is not
to say that the Court will examine the merits or
settle the dispute.  The specified limits of the Court's examination are the
ascertainment
of whether there is a "genuine dispute" and whether there is a
"genuine claim". 
<P>

		It is often possible to discern the spurious, and to identify mere bluster or
assertion.  But beyond a perception of genuineness
(or the lack of it) the
Court has no function.  It is not helpful to perceive that one party is more
likely than the other to succeed,
or that the eventual state of the account
between the parties is more likely to be one result than another.
<P>

		The essential task is relatively simply - to identify the genuine level of a
claim (not the likely result of it) and to identify
the genuine level of an
offsetting claim (not the likely result of it).'
<P>

	     I respectfully agree with those statements."
<P>

17	     In one of his affidavits Mr Taylor, who is manager and director of the
plaintiff, indicated that he instructed the company's
solicitors to prepare an
application seeking appropriate declaration that each of the companies in the
Palmer group as described
in the agreement are jointly and severally liable to
indemnify each of the companies in the Taylor group and to seek rectification
to achieve that result.
<P>

18	     Given this approach to the matter, I think it is probably inappropriate
to deal with the matter in the way in which Cohen
J did in<b> Delnorth Pty Ltd
v State Bank of New South Wales</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=17%20ACSR%20279" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">17 ACSR 279.</a>  This is because apart from
the terms of the deed itself, there is an evidentiary area that may impact upon
the question of the construction.
<P>

19	     In a letter from the Building Durability Group, which apparently is the
company through which Mr Palmer does his work, dated
4 June 1998, he referred
to a question of warranties for a construction project at Blandville Court.
That was not the one which was
concerned with the proceedings that have been
settled giving rise to the offsetting claim.  His letter notes the novation of
existing
warranties and liabilities and then in paragraph 3 says the
following:
<P>

	"Whilst Building Durability will be fully liable to the Department of Housing
as a result of the novation, the liabilities of our
associated entities in
respect of the initial contract will of course continue as per our partitioning
agreement (Clause 9)."
<P>

20	     It can be seen from this that the defendant seemed to on  one view of
that paragraph to consider that associated entities
in respect of the initial
contract would continue to have liabilities and refers to clause 9.  This is
somewhat contrary to the construction
of that clause, which would suggest it is
only the individuals who have liability under it. Such a statement may be an
admission.
<P>

21	     Recently in<b> Ronnoc Finance P/L v Spectrum Network Services P/L
Santow J</b> (1996), his Honour in dealing with this matter had the following
to say:
<P>

	"...there is Court of Appeal authority that such admissions are admissible,
insofar as providing material from which a court may
determine a question of
law, a question of fact, or a question of mixed fact and law; see<b> Pitcher
&amp; Anor v Langford &amp; Anor</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20142" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23 NSWLR 142</a> at 160B per Handley JA
(Kirby P concurring at 146) and earlier<b> Grey v Australian Motorists and
General Insurance  Co Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%201%20NSWLR%20669" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] 1 NSWLR 669</a> at 684 per Mahoney JA
and<b> Jones v Sutherland Shire Council </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%202%20NSWLR%20206" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 2 NSWLR 206</a> at 231. The
question of construction of a contract is a question of law. It can in
principle make no difference whether the admissions
were made before or after
entry into the contract. Indeed, the admission is more likely in practice to be
made after the contract
is entered into."
<P>

22	     If one comes back and looks at the deed, there are a number of matters
that immediately become apparent.  On the defendant's
construction, one of the
most important is, of course, the use of the words themselves, namely, "the
parties".  A party to a deed
or an agreement is to use an expression well known
to the law and refers to those parties executing the agreements and being
expressed
to be a party. Clearly, it is the two individuals who fulfil that
description.
<P>

23	 It is also interesting to note that the expression "the parties" has been
used elsewhere in the deed, for example, in paragraph
10.  There is it is said
that the parties have an equal entitlement to income, profits, losses and
outgoings, et cetera.  That, no
doubt, reflects what is in recital A, which I
have already referred to and would seem to indicate that the ultimate
beneficial owners
through whatever company structures might intervene are the
two individuals.
<P>

24	     Also, interestingly, in clause 7.3, there is a reference which shows an
indication when group liability is imported, if
that is desired.  That clause
provides that, "each party covenants, either personally, or through their
group, equally to finance
and support and maintain Theodore Taylor and
Gwendolyn Taylor".
<P>

25	    If the draftsman wished to put up a group liability, clearly, there was
a proper mechanism to be able to do it. If one thinks
of factors pointing the
other way, one of the ones is, of course, the question of the admission which I
have referred to and the
other matters arise out of the terms of clause 9
itself.  The subject matter is "all claims and liabilities of any nature" and
it
is those matters which may arise in respect of the businesses conducted by
the group.
<P>

26	     It is plain from the description of the businesses within the deed that
there are different businesses carried on by different
companies and trading
trusts. That being so, one could anticipate that all claims and liabilities of
any nature would essentially
include claims on warranties, guarantees, third
party accident claims and perhaps even claims against directors of
companies.
<P>

27	     The clause is very general in nature and, in fact, quite wide in its
ambit and perhaps reflects a desire to preserve the
way in which the grant
operated prior to the split up with various companies and, ultimately, the two
founders being liable for ultimate
payment.
<P>

28	     Another point that has been raised is the contrast between the way
clause 9 is expressed and the way clauses 13 and 14 are
expressed.  In the
latter case, clearly, it is individual causes of action which are released and
the draftsman has been careful
to limit it to individuals by using those
defined names which come from the recital of the parties at the commencement of
the deed.
<P>

29	     I appreciate that there may be contrary arguments to this, namely, it
is an easier drafting technique than using one which
seeks to incorporate all
the releases in one clause. Be that as it may, it is a slightly contrary
indication and the matter itself
is not easy of resolution.
<P>

30	     Before coming to a conclusion on it I want to dispose of one other
argument which was also raised.  That was the  question
of whether or not the
affidavit of Mr Sommerville sworn 22 February 1999 is a sufficient affidavit
for the purposes of the application.
<P>

31	     The law in this regard is conveniently set out in the judgment of
Sunburg J in<b> Graywinter Properties Pty. Limited  v  Gas and Fuel Corporation
Superannuation Fund, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1996/822.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] FCA 822</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=21%20ACSR%20581" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">21 ACSR 581</a> at 586.</b> At 587.8 his Honour had the
following to say: 
<P>

	"Is a complying affidavit a condition of jurisdiction?
<P>

	 It seems to me that s 459G(3) makes plain that the Court can entertain an
application to set aside only if within the prescribed
period an affidavit
supporting the application is filed and copies of the application and affidavit
are served.   The High Court
in<b> Grant</b> said that compliance with the
subsection is a limitation or a condition upon the authority of the Court to
set aside a demand; it
is a condition of the jurisdiction that subs (3) be
observed; if the condition is not observed there is no application before the
Court.  I am thus unable to agree with the Senior Master that the failure of an
affidavit to satisfy the minimum requirements for
an affidavit to be a
'supporting affidavit' is not a jurisdictional impediment.
<P>

	 The minimum requirements in a genuine dispute case.
<P>

	 In order to be a 'supporting affidavit', an affidavit must say something that
promotes the company's case.  An affidavit which
merely says 'I am a director
of the company but am too busy at present to make a full affidavit, and I will
do so later' would not
support the application.  It would in no way advance,
further or assist the company's cause, which is to have the notice set aside.
At the other extreme, the affidavit need not detail, in admissible form, all
the evidence that supports the contention of a genuine
dispute: John Holland.
That evidence must be available at the hearing of the application to set aside,
because that application is
for final and not interlocutory relief:  71 Paisley
Street.
<P>

	 In a s 459H1(a)case, the affidavit must in my view disclose facts showing
there is a genuine dispute between the parties.  A mere
assertion that there is
a genuine dispute is not enough.  Nor is there a care claim that the debt is
disputed sufficient. It follows
from the fact that the affidavit need not go
into evidence, which is the customary function of an affidavit, that it may
read like
a pleading.
<P>

	An affidavit which exhibits an exchange of correspondence between the parties
or between their solicitors from which it appears
that a claim is made and
rejected for reasons given can qualify as a supporting affidavit.  And an
affidavit verifying the pleadings
in an action may qualify.
<P>

	 I am thus unable to accept the respondent's submission that the affidavit
must contain sufficient material to make out a case
under s 459H.  In reply,
that submission was somewhat retreated from.  It was said that the affidavit
must, as a minimum, contain
a statement of the material facts on which  the
applicant intends to rely to show a genuine dispute- it might read more like a
pleading
than a story.  That accords with what I consider to be the minimum
requirement.
<P>

	.......A multitude of affidavits?
<P>

	 In several cases, it has been held that an applicant is not restricted on the
hearing to the affidavit that is served with the
application.  See<b>
Scanhill</b> at 467 and<b> Mibor Investments Pty. Limited v Commonwealth Bank
of Australia <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1994/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] VicRp 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACSR%20362" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 ACSR 362</a> at 368.</b>  An applicant whose initial
affidavit has satisfied the threshold test must be able to supplement the
material, because while the
'supporting' affidavit does not have to deploy the
evidence, on the hearing only admissible evidence can be relied on.  In
<b>Louisbridge</b>, Ryan J said that 'provided that an affidavit is filed and
served within the 21 day period which supports the application by providing
grounds for concluding that there is a genuine dispute...or that the company
has an offsetting claim', supporting affidavits may
be filed under the period
has expired.  Apart from<b> Hire Works</b>, the cases do not support the
proposition for which the applicant contended, namely, that an affidavit that
does not satisfy the
threshold test can be supplemented later on.  That issue
did not arise in <b>Scanhill</b> or<b> Mibor</b>.  It did arise in Hire Works,
but for the reasons I have given, I am respectfully unable to agree that the
Court can entertain as
an application under s459G a case in which an affidavit
containing the minimum requirements has not been served within time."
<P>

32	     In determining this question, I think it is proper when considering the
affidavit of Mr Sommerville of 22 February 1999,
to have regard not only to the
material that was ultimately admitted before me on today's hearing, but also
those parts of the affidavit
which I rejected, as they were not in proper form
for the purposes of the final hearing.
<P>

33	     It is proper to do so because one has to judge whether the material set
out in the affidavit is such as may be described
as promoting the plaintiff's
case and because, as his Honour points out, the initial affidavit does not have
to be in admissible
form for a final hearing.
<P>

34	     With this in mind and looking at the matter clearly, I think the
affidavit articulates the basis of the offsetting claiming
that is proposed to
be made.  It sets out the detail of the events giving rise to the claim by
Meriton Apartments, it exhibits a
copy of the agreements, makes an allegation
the individuals entered that agreement as agents for all of the companies in
the group
and shows how the numbers then available on the then demand were made
up.
<P>

35	     It my view, the affidavit set out the framework for the argument which
was to be put and is appropriate.  It is sufficient
to give jurisdiction to
deal with the matter.
<P>

36	     That then brings me back to the fundamental question of whether there
is a genuine dispute.  One of the matters that inclines
me to a view that the
dispute might be genuine are the statements that the plaintiff proposes to
bring proceedings to seek rectification
and/or, in addition, declarations for
the construction for which it contends.
<P>

37	      Section 459 M of the Corporations Law provides that an order under
section 459H or 459J may be made subject to conditions.
 In other words, the
demand may be set aside subject to conditions.  If the plaintiff were to bring
those proceedings, that certainly
indicates a sincere view on its part that it
thinks it may be likely to succeed, rather than simply making a suggestion that
these
proceedings might be brought in order to bolster the genuineness of the
case.
<P>

38	     I am minded, therefore, to make an order, the effect of which will be
that in the event that the plaintiff, within 21 days,
brings proceedings for
the rectification of the deed of 25 June 1997, seeking to change that deed to
accord with the view it has
propounded in these proceedings, that the demand be
set aside and in the event that it does not bring those proceedings within 21
days of today's date, I would order that the proceedings be dismissed.
<P>

39	     Having indicated the view that I take and the order that I would
propose to make, rather than formally making the order
at this stage, I will at
the request of the parties stand the proceedings over until Thursday 24 June
1999 before me at 10 am. 
<P>
