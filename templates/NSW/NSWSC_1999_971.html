<b><u>NO. 3258 OF 1999</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>S.C. TOURS PTY. LIMITED &amp; ORS.  V.  SINGER &amp; ORS.</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	On 17th November 1997, an agreement was made between SC Tours
Pty. Limited (which I will call "SC"), George and Glenda Sampson,
Leslie
Singer, Australian Panoramic Coach Pty. Limited (which I will call "Auspan"),
Sector Australia Pty. Limited (which I will
call "Sector") and Keiko Adachi to
settle proceedings No. 2035 of 1997 and No. 2344 of 1997 in the Supreme Court
of New South Wales.
 That agreement provided, among other things, that Mr. and
Mrs. Sampson should purchase from Mr. Singer his shares in SC, at a price
to be
determined by a valuer.  There has been a valuation provided purportedly
pursuant to this agreement, but there are disputes
as to its validity and
effect.  
<P>

2  	By their summons in these proceedings filed on 20th July 1999, SC
and Mr. and Mrs. Sampson seek against Mr. Singer, Mr. Adachi,
Sector and Auspan
(1) a declaration that the valuation has a certain effect and is binding; (2)
an order that the transfer of shares
proceed; and (3) (in the alternative, and
by amendment) an order that the valuation be completed in a certain manner.
These orders
are opposed by Mr. Singer.  The other defendants have entered
submitting appearances.  
<P>

<b><u>OUTLINE OF FACTS</u></b>
<P>

3  	SC was incorporated in 1990.  Mr. Singer owned 50% of the shares,
and Mr. and Mrs. Sampson owned the other 50%.  SC owned buses
and used them in
the conduct of a business of providing tours.  Its directors were Mr. Singer
and Mr. and Mrs. Sampson, but since
about April 1997 the effective control of
the company has been with Mr. and Mrs. Sampson.  
<P>

4  	Sector was incorporated in 1992, owned equally by Mr. and Mrs.
Sampson's daughter and Mr. Singer's brother.  Its business activities
were
connected with those of SC, and the employees of both companies worked in the
connected activities.  
<P>

5  	Auspan was incorporated in 1993, and has been substantially
controlled by interests associated with Mr. Singer.
<P>

6  	In the five years to 30th June 1997, SC was registered with the
payroll tax office as an employer, but Sector and Auspan were
not.  
<P>

7  	In about April 1997, disputes arose between Mr. and Mrs. Sampson
and Mr. Singer.  Mr. and Mrs. Sampson effectively excluded
Mr. Singer from the
business of SC, and caused SC to bring proceedings No. 2035 of 1997 against Mr.
Singer, alleging inter alia that
he had misapplied cash of the order of
$600,000.00.  Mr. Singer brought a cross-claim, alleging that Mr. Sampson was
involved in
a dishonest scheme to avoid tax.  Mr. Singer also commenced
proceedings No. 2344 of 1999 for the winding up of SC on the just and
equitable
ground.  It was these two proceedings that were settled by the agreement of
17th November 1997.  
<P>

8  	There were in fact three agreements of that date.  The principal
one was the sale of shares in SC from Mr. Singer to Mr. and
Mrs. Sampson, at a
price determined by a valuer.  Clauses 2, 3 and 4 of that agreement were in the
following terms:
<P>

<b><i>2.	The price to be paid for the shares shall be determined by an
independent consulting accountant experienced in the valuation of
shares of
private companies such person to be agreed by the Sampsons and Singer and in
the event of failure to agree within 14 days
of the date hereof, such valuer
shall be appointed by the President for the time being of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants.
 The valuer shall act as an expert and not an arbitrator
and his valuation shall be binding on the Sampsons and Singer who agree
to
cooperate with the valuer and provide him with all information and
documentation that he may require.  The costs and expenses
of the valuation
(including any costs of reconstructing the accounts as at 30 April 1997) are to
be borne as to one h alf by the
Sampsons and as to the other half by Singer.
Each shall pay to the valuer his or their share of such costs and expenses
before the
valuer releases the valuation to them.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>3.	The valuer shall carry out the valuation on the following
bases:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(a)	the valuation date shall be 30 April 1997 (the valuation
date);</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(b)	the assets and liabilities (including goodwill, if any) of Sector and
Auspan at the valuation date shall be brought to account
and consolidated with
the assets and liabilities of S C Tours to the intent that for the purpose only
of valuing the shares in S
C Tours, the assets, liabilities and businesses of S
C Tours, Sector and Auspan shall be regarded as all part of the one entity,
S C
Tours, with the result that, inter alia, any loan accounts between the three
companies shall not be treated as assets or liabilities
(as the case may be) of
the respective companies and shall be disregarded in the valuation;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(c)	the debt due from S C Tours to Singer for his loan account with S C
Tours (the loan account) shall be deemed to be nil;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(d)	if as at the valuation date S C Tours has any liability to anyone for
legal costs incurred to that date inconsequence of the dispute
which gave rise
to the proceedings, that liability will not be taken into account and shall be
deemed to be the personal liability
of the Sampsons.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>4.	The valuer is not to be pressed by the parties with submissions.  The
parties will be passive only but will promptly provide to
the valuer such
information as he requests provided however that the valuer shall take into
account only actual liabilities (including
payroll and other taxes and/or
penalties by any or all of S C Tours, Sector and Auspan which liabilities must
be determined before
the valuation occurs) in arriving at his
valuation.</i></b>
<P>

9  	The second and third agreements were mutual releases, which also
contained covenants to keep all matters which gave rise to
or arose in the
proceedings confidential.  
<P>

10  	Prior to the settlement, an accountant Christopher Hall was
engaged by Mr. and Mrs. Sampson.  On the day of the settlement,
he had made
enquiries concerning payroll tax but was referred to the Parramatta Office of
State Revenue.  On 17th February 1998,
he saw Ms. Kaczorek, an inspector at
that office.  A conversation took place, which is set out in paragraphs 11 to
14 of Mr. Hall's
affidavit of 24th August 1999, as follows:
<P>

<b><i>11.	At the meeting I informed Ms. Kaczorek of the shareholdings and
directorships of the three companies and went on to explain to
the
effect,</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>"The Manager of the three companies is Leslie Singer.  The records of the
companies are maintained by the accountant of S C Tours
and some of the
employees of each of the three companies are used in the businesses of the
other two companies.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>I wish to establish whether the Office of State Revenue considers the
companies part of a group for the payroll tax provisions."</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>12.	Ms. Kaczorek went onto ask me a number of questions to which I
responded as set out hereunder:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>KK:	What are the mechanics of how the books of the companies are
maintained, particularly in relation to wages?"</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>CH	"The books are maintained by the accountant of S C Tours although some
of the transactions are maintained independently of the
other companies.
However, as often happens, the amount of money in a bank account of a
particular company often determines into which
account money is banked or from
which account money is drawn."</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>KK:	"What type of businesses do the companies conduct?"</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>CH:	"S C Tours and Sector are involved in providing mainly inbound bus
and coach services and Auspan is involved in organising group
tours."</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>KK:	"Which employees are employed by which company and used by the other
companies?"</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>CH:	"The best way of answering this question is to give you these
records" (and I handed to Ms. Kaczorek the records which I brought
to the
meeting, which records are exhibited and marked "CJH1").</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>KK:	"What are the respective inputs of Leslie Singer and George
Sampson?"</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>CH:	"Mr. Singer is the Managing Director and runs the day to day affairs
of each company.  Mr. Sampson has minimal involvement in
the day to day conduct
of the companies and their businesses.  He considers his role more of a guiding
role and he attends the companies'
premises occasionally to check matters such
as bank statements, cheque books and the like."</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>13.	Ms. Kaczorek said to me to the effect, "From what you have told me
and these records, there is little doubt that the three companies
are liable
under the group provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/" class="autolink_findacts">Payroll Tax Act</a>."</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>14.	I said to Ms. Kaczorek to the effect, "This approach to your office
has been voluntary and has not emanated from any action by
the Payroll Tax
Office.  You should take that account into account when establishing penalties.
Also, whilst I understand there will
be a liability, S C Tours in particular
will have great difficulty in meeting any liability and the extent of penalties
could make
it impossible.  Ms. Kaczorek said to the effect, "I will take all of
that into account."  Ms. Kaczorek also said to me to the effect,
"Although the
Office of State Revenue is entitled to look to S C Tours for payment of the
liabilities of Auspan and Sector, it will
not seek to extract from S C Tours
the money payable by Auspan and Sector even if those companies are unable to
pay the liabilities
imposed on them."</i></b>
<P>

11  	On 20th February 1998, Ms. Kaczorek sent Mr. Hall calculations
of payroll tax.  On about 23rd February 1998, Mr. Hall received
Notices of
Assessment of payroll tax in relation to the three companies, the effect of
which can be summarised as follows:

<P>

12  	On 3rd March 1998, a letter of instructions from Mr. Jenkins,
the solicitor for Mr. Singer, and Mr. Hewett, the solicitor for
Mr. and Mrs.
Sampson, was sent to an accountant Warwick Finney.  This letter set out the
relevant clauses of the contract, and concluded
as follows:
<P>

<b><i>As the parties have bound themselves not to press you with submissions,
they do not propose at this stage to do anything more than
request you to
acquaint yourself with the terms of the above clauses.  If, having done so, you
feel you require further clarification
as to the requirements of the above
clauses, would you be so kind as to state your queries in a letter and fax or
post that letter
to both of the above law firms.  We will then endeavour to
formulate a joint letter answering your queries.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>The parties desire, and have so contracted, to have you approach your
task with a completely independent mind bound only be the arrangements
set
forth in the above clauses, and without interference from any of them.  They
will, of course, provide you will (sic) all information,
documentation or
assistance that your may request.</i></b>
<P>

13  	On 28th April 1998, Mr. Finney wrote to these solicitors, asking
for information.  There ensued substantial correspondence,
between June and
August 1998, as to how this request should be dealt with.  This resulted in a
letter from both solicitors to Mr.
Finney dated 4th September 1998, which inter
alia enclosed financial statements of the relevant companies, noting that they
did not
include liability for payroll tax, and also enclosed the assessments
for payroll tax.
<P>

14  	On 13th October 1998, Mr. Finney wrote again to the solicitors
with some questions, including a question numbered 2 in the
following terms:
<P>

<b><i>2.	No financial statements have been prepared beyond 30 June 1996 for
Sector or Auspan.  I have been informed that both companies
ceased operating
about April 1997 and that there have been no activities of any nature since
that date.  You are aware that I am
to include the assets and liabilities of
these companies in the valuation of S C Tours but ignoring inter company loan
accounts.
 The books of these two companies have not been finalised for the
1996/97 year and from the information with which I have been presented
the loan
account balances between the companies and S C Tours do not cancel
out.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>As I see the position I have two options.  Firstly, I could insist that
the accounts of Sector and Auspan be brought up to date with
the inter company
accounts in agreement.  Secondly, I could make an assumption that the accounts
of the companies are of little consequence
to the valuation of S C Tours and
disregard any effect they may have on the valuation.  A problem with this
approach is that it has
been indicated to me that there are superannuation and
group tax liabilities outstanding in Auspan but I have not been able to
determine
the amounts of such liabilities.  Also I have no evidence that the
companies did cease operating in April 1997.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>If I were to adopt the second option of ignoring the effect the accounts
of these companies have on the valuation of S C Tours, it
could only be with
the agreement of the parties.  Would you please obtain instructions in this
regard and advise me of the approach
I should follow.</i></b>
<P>

15  	There followed further correspondence between the solicitors
concerning a response to Mr. Finney's letter.  In the course of
that
correspondence, in a letter to Mr. Hewett dated 15th February 1999, Mr. Jenkins
stated the following:
<P>

<b><i>With regard to the draft letter you have prepared to Mr. Finney, you make
reference to the payroll tax liabilities of the companies.
 However, we
understand that were no such </i><cite>actual</cite><i> liabilities as at the
valuation date of 30th April 1997.  </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>These liabilities arose when Mr. Hall approached the payroll tax
authorities and this happened after settlement.  Accordingly, whilst
the
superannuation and group tax liabilities ought to be taken into account, the
valuer should be specifically informed that the
payroll tax liability of each
company was not an actual liability as at the 30th April 1997 and, pursuant to
clause 4 of the Deed
of Agreement, not be included for the purpose of the
valuation.</i></b>
<P>

16  	Mr. Hewett responded in a letter dated 1st March 1999, in the
following terms:
<P>

<b><i>Any objective assessment of relevant provisions of the Pay-Roll Tax Act
will make it clear that any employer (or member of a group)
who pays wages of
more than the stipulated amount (the relevant group so qualifies) should apply
for registration as an employer
(Section 12); every employer who is registered
or required to apply for registration should furnish a return within 7 days of
the
close of each month (Section 13); and that every employer liable to pay
payroll tax shall pay the tax within the time within which
he is required to
lodge the return (Section 17).</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>The payroll liabilities of the companies were undoubtedly actual as at
April 1997 and the Commissioner has determined them before
the valuation has
occurred.  The liabilities existed before Mr. Hall approached the Commissioner
who has determined the amount of
the liabilities.</i></b>
<P>

17  	On 29th March 1999, a letter from the two solicitors was sent to
Mr. Finney, the relevant part of which was the answer to Mr.
Finney's paragraph
numbered 2, which response was as follows:
<P>

<b><i>With the exception of the group's payroll tax liabilities, the parties
have agreed that the accounts of Sector and Auspan need not
be taken account of
in the valuation of S C Tours.  However, there are differences between the
parties as to whether the payroll
tax liabilities were actual debts as at April
1997 to be taken account of in the valuation.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>We enclose copies of assessments of payroll tax and ask that two
valuations be prepared, one including the payroll tax liabilities
and the other
excluding the payroll tax liabilities. </i></b>
<P>

18  	Mr. Finney issued his valuation on 18th June 1999.  Paragraph 25
of his valuation dealt with the matter of payroll tax, as
follows:
<P>

<b><i>25.	I have been advised of a liability of payroll tax imposed on each of
S C Tours, Sector and Auspan and details of the amounts applicable
to each
company are contained in copies of assessments forming part of Annexure 2.
Although the payroll tax assessments are to each
company separately, under the
payroll tax legislation, each company in a group is liable for the amount of
the tax applicable to
the group.  From my examination of the financial
statements there would be doubt that Sector or Auspan would be able to meet the
amounts assessed to each of them and accordingly S C Tours must record as a
liability, the whole of the amount assessed.  This liability
total
$375,716.</i></b>
<P>

19  	The valuation went on to assess the value of SC at 30th April
1999, excluding payroll tax liability, at $91,572.00, making
Mr. Singer's half
share $45,786.00.  However, it went on to say that if the payroll tax liability
of $375,716.00 was taken into account,
SC would have a negative value, and Mr.
Singer's shares should be valued at nil.
<P>

20  	There followed a number of letters from Mr. Jenkins to Mr.
Hewett setting out Mr. Singer's contentions on the matter of payroll
tax.  The
first was a letter of 5th August 1999, the relevant part of which was as
follows:
<P>

<b><i>Our client simply says that it is not correct to say (as para 1 of the
summons suggests) that at the valuation date there existed
an actual liability
for payroll tax, penalties and interest.  At that date any liability for
payroll tax, penalties and interest
was contingent only and not actual and the
agreement provided that the valuation be made without taking account of any
contingent
liabilities.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>We appreciate that Mr. Sampson's affidavit does not state but there can
be no issue that the payroll tax assessments attached to his
affidavit issued
after the valuation date.  Indeed they were the consequence of action taken by
the Sampson interests after the date
of the execution of the Deed.  At the
valuation date the prospect, in the future, of some revised payroll tax bills
issuing was nothing
more than a remote possibility.</i></b>
<P>

21  	Next, there was a letter of 20th August 1999, the relevant part
of which was as follows:
<P>

<b><i>Our client's case has always been that the shares must be valued on the
basis of actual liabilities due and payable as at 30 April
1997.  Any potential
debts or contingent debts extant at 30 April 1997 (but not then payable) were
not to be taken account of.  Before
giving his valuation the valuer was
required to determine the quantum of the actual debts due and payable by any of
the three companies
including actual tax debts.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>The agreement forbade the voluntary giving of any information to any
public authorities of any of the matters thrown up in the settled
proceedings
and included in those matters were the circumstances that income had not been
brought to account in the companies' tax
returns and payroll tax had not been
paid by Auspan and Sector.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>What in fact occurred was that Mr. Hall, after the settlement contract,
despite the agreement's embargo on voluntary disclosure to
public authorities,
made representation (which our side were in no way privy to), which resulted in
the Department issuing Notices
of Assessment for payroll tax in February
1998.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>There is no evidence to suggest that the valuer ever went about the task
of assessing actual tax or other liabilities payable as at
30 April 1997.  The
only assessment that has ever taken place is an assessment of payroll tax by
the Office of State Finance on information
provided by your side of the dispute
to that Office.  That assessment is for a period ending 30 June 1997 and
includes penalties.
 We have no knowledge of what was told to the assessor by
Mr. Hall or what assumptions were made by the assessor.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>The whole matter was one for the valuer and not for the Office of State
Revenue or anyone else.  Indeed the valuer was supposed to
be left very much to
his own devices.  The last thing that was supposed to happen with him was that
one side would unilaterally present
him with information which is exactly what
occurred with the Office of State Revenue before it arrived at its
assessments.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>In essence, the admissions you seek are a concession that the sum of
money that the valuer might have determined as payable for payroll
tax as at 30
April 1997, if the issue had (as we intended) been left to him would have just
happened to have turned out to be the
same amount as the Office of State
Finance assessed (in February 1998) as due on 30 June 1997.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>The fact is none of us will ever know what the valuer might have
determined as actually payable at the valuation date on account of
payroll tax
if the agreement had been duly performed according to its terms.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Our client cannot admit that as at 30 April 1997 any of the 3 companies
were then indebted to the Office of State Finance for payroll
tax or penalties
thereon.  All that our client concedes is that as at April 1997 those companies
had contingent liabilities for payroll
tax, the quantum of which, if any, was
dependent on all manner of possible scenarios, conjectures and opinions.  To
the extent the
actuality could be ascertained, that was a matter of the sole
judgment of the valuer.</i></b>
<P>

22  	Then there was a letter of 23rd August 1999, the relevant part
of which was as follows:
<P>

<b><i>As for the more important matter of admissions, we do not consider that
it is open to the parties, in the light of the events that
have occurred, to
litigate in these or any proceedings the issue as to what the actual
liabilities of the 3 companies, for payroll
tax/penalties etc, were as at 30
April 1997.  That issue was wound up into the agreement of November 1997 and,
according to our client's
construction of the agreement, that issue was to be
resolved, in a certain way, by the valuer.  As we understand it, your client's
claim is that the issue was resolved, in accordance with the agreement, by the
issue of the Notices of Assessment.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>What is between us is a question of construction of the agreement, not a
question as to what, as a matter of fact and law, in truth
was payable by any
or all of these companies in April 1997.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>It is our view that the matter can be concluded on 27 August 1999 as the
matter of construction that it always was.  We appreciate
that the issue of the
quantum of the companies' actual payroll tax liabilities at the valuation would
or could have been contentious.
 But, in that events that have occurred, that
issue is no longer alive.  All that is alive is that you say the amount
demanded in
February 1998 was an actual liability in April 1997 and we say it
was not.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>We will oppose any attempt to vacate the hearing date in order for your
clients to endeavour to prove, by evidence, what in truth
and in fact the
actual liabilities, if any, were.</i></b>
<P>

23  	Finally, there was a letter of 25th August 1999, the relevant
part of which was as follows:
<P>

<b><i>As we have come to understand your position (as expressed in your letter
of 1 March 1999) you say that, under the way the Payroll
Tax legislation
operated from 1992 to 30 April 1997, there existed, on 30 April 1997, binding
each of the three companies, an obligation
to pay an ascertainable sum of money
- an actual liability within the meaning of the agreement.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>We do not dispute that the Payroll Tax legislation worked so as to
create, depending on the existence of certain facts, current obligations,
binding employers, to make payments of ascertainable sums of money.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Under the agreement, as it stood in November 1997, we say the
determination of the existence as at 30 April 1997 of an actual liability
to
pay money to the Payroll Tax Office, and the quantification of the amount of
that sum, if any, was a matter for the valuer.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>As we understand your letter of 1 March 1999 you say there was a
liability to pay payroll tax extant at 30 April 1997.  "The liabilities
existed
before Mr. Hall approached the Commissioner who has determined the amount of
the liabilities", you said.  This was reactive
to our letter of 15 February
1999 were (sic) we said "These liabilities arose when Mr. Hall approached the
payroll tax authorities
and this happened after settlement."</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>We are saying that the Commissioner's demand was not a liability that was
payable in April 1997 and you are saying that the Commissioner's
demand was no
more than a determination by him of the quantum of a liability that did in fact
exist as at 30 April 1997.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>It was with this difference of opinion between us that we wrote our joint
letter of 29 March 1999 to Mr. Finney.  We supplied him
with evidence of the
amounts demanded by the Commissioner and explained to him that "there are
differences between the parties as
to whether the payroll tax liabilities were
actual debts as at April 1997" and asked him to complete his work with one
valuation
on the basis that the amounted (sic) demanded by the Commissioner was
an actual debt in April 1997 and one on the basis that it was
not.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Whether the agreement contemplated Mr. Hall going to the Payroll Tax
Commissioner to have the Commissioner calculate the quantum,
if any, of any
moneys that might have been actually payable back in April 1997 with the
parties, as it were, agreeing to accept the
Commissioner's figure as final, is
a pure matter of construction of the agreement of November 1997.  We are very
much at issue about
this question of interpretation of the written
agreement.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Whether the Commissioner's activity, culminating in the issuing by him of
the February 1998 demands, was a process of ascertaining,
for the parties, the
quantum of the three companies' actual liabilities as at 30 April 1997, is very
much a question of interpretation
of the legislation.  We are clearly at issue
on these matters.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Because of the way the parties have conducted themselves up to the time
of the commencement of the construction proceedings, it is
simply not open to
either side to now broaden the issues.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>The plaintiffs apparently wish to establish, either by evidence, or by
agreement as to facts, that at all material times from 1992
or 1993 to April
1997 the three companies were a "group" within the meaning of the Pay roll
(sic) tax legislation.  We understand
that if they were a group, or if any two
of them were a group, that circumstance would affect the quantification of the
amount of
payroll tax that had, from time to time, to be paid to the
Commissioner.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>This sort of evidence can only be relevant to show what the so-called
group's actual payroll tax liabilities were as at 30 April 1997.
 But this is
not an issue which the parties are entitled to raise or litigate.  It is simply
irrelevant.  You have said, on page
2 of your letter, that you agree with
this.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>If the amount demanded by the Commissioner in February 1998 is, as you
say, a determination of an actual liability, within the true
meaning of the
agreement of November 1997, your client will be entitled to the declaration it
seeks.  If, as we say, the liability
to comply with the Commissioner's demands
did not exist in April 1997, your clients will fail.</i></b>
<P>

24  	Mr. Jenkins sent a second letter to Mr. Hewett dated 25th August
1999, seeking admission of a number of facts including the
following:
<P>

<b><i>Until the service of the affidavit of Mr. Hall at about 12.45pm on 25
August 1999, there had been no communication to the Singer side
of the record
by the Sampson side of the record of any of the events and conversations
deposed to by Mr. Hall in paragraphs 10, 11,
12, 13, 14 and 15.</i></b>
<P>

25  	Mr. Hewett responded with a letter of 26th August 1999, which
dealt with the paragraph numbered 1 as follows:
<P>

<b><i>1.	As mentioned above, since March 1998 your firm has had copies of the
Notices of Assessment which were made available by Mr. Hall.
 Also, we made
available to you copies of the assessments at about the same time.  You have
noted that the notices were served on
Mr. Hall's firm.  Otherwise, the facts
are admitted, but again, we observe that your client took no action to
challenge the assessments
or ascertain the basis on which they were
made.</i></b>
<P>

26  	The final relevant letter prior to the hearing on 27th August
1999 was a letter from Mr. Jenkins to Mr. Hewett dated 26th August
1999, the
relevant part of which was as follows:
<P>

<b><i>There seems, despite all our efforts to spell out for you in writing, the
substance of our client's defence to your claim for a declaration
that the 3
companies were actually liable, in April 1997, to pay to the Pay Roll Tax Dept
the sum of money assessed by that Department
in February 1998, some lack of
understanding on your part as to what that defence is.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>We do not suggest that the assessments carried out under s.18 were
invalid or ultra vires.  In our letter to you of 19 August 1999
(para 5) we
advised "If it is of any assistance to you, it is not proposed to suggest that
the sums demanded by the Office of State
Finance from February 1998 are sums
that the office arrived at in any arbitrary or invalid manner.  They would
appear to be claims
that the Office would have title to sue for as and from
February 1998".  Consistently with this position we have sought the admission
number 3 in our letter that your letter of today is in answer to.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>If the Summons sought a declaration that the three companies are
presently indebted for the sum assessed by the Commissioner in February
1998,
Mr. Singer would not be defending it.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>What we disagree with is the proposition, included in the declaration
sought, that the sum assessed by the Commissioner in February
1998 was, at the
valuation date, an actual liability within the true construction of the written
agreement of November 1997.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>With respect, the fallacy in your thinking is that you appear to hold
that if accrued payroll tax debts are of their nature actually
payable from
month to month (which we said in the 4th paragraph of our letter of 25 August
was so) it follows that the sum assessed
by the Commissioner in February 1998
was actually due and payable in April 1997.  It is not our side's fault that
you have continued
to adhere to this non sequitur.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>You are responsible for the drafting of the Summons.  You have advanced
the propositions that its prayers for relief assumes.  You
have chosen the
battle ground and, in the process expressly confirmed our view that "it is not
open to the parties to litigate in
any proceedings the amount of the actual
liabilities of the companies for payroll tax/penalties etc. as at 30 April
1997" (your letter
24 August 1998, page 2).</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Either you are correct and the Commissioner's figure is an actual
liability as contemplated by the agreement, or you are incorrect
and that is an
end to the matter.</i></b>
<P>

27  	It was common ground at the hearing that SC and Sector at least
should be grouped for payroll tax purposes.  However, Mr. Singer
contended that
Auspan should not be grouped with either of the other companies; and if that
were correct, the amounts set out in
the Notices of Assessment would be
excessive (because there would be separate thresholds for SC and Sector on the
one hand and Auspan
on the other), and SC would have no liability in relation
to Auspan's employees.  It would seem that if payroll tax was assessed
for SC
and Sector on that basis, then the payroll tax owing by SC in respect of the
relevant periods up to 30th April 1997 would
be $63,862.22, and that the
payroll tax owing by Sector would be $87,776.55.  It is common ground that each
company in such a group
is liable for the payroll tax for the whole of the
group.  I have been provided also with an estimate of interest on those amounts
up to 30th April 1997, being $15,489.67 for SC and $30,575.77 for Sector, but
there is no agreement as to the calculation of that
interest.
<P>

<b><u>ISSUES</u></b>
<P>

28  	The principal issue raised by the parties is which of two
valuations of Mr. Singer's shares submitted by the valuer should
be adopted as
the price of the shares under the agreement of 17th November 1997, nil or
$45,786.00.  In short, Mr. Tobias QC for
the plaintiffs submitted that it
should be nil, because SC's payroll tax liability was an actual liability at
valuation date, even
though the Notices of Assessment did not issue until
February 1998; whereas Mr. Motbey for Mr. Singer submitted that the only
liability
for payroll tax submitted to the valuer for consideration was the
liability created by the Notices, and <i>that</i> liability did not exist at
the valuation date.  
<P>

29  	This issue requires construction of the agreement between the
parties (as affected by later correspondence), and also consideration
of the
effect of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/" class="autolink_findacts">Payroll Tax Act 1971</a>, the relevant parts of which are as
follows:
<P>

the number of days in the financial year)
of the pay-roll tax that would be payable by the employer for the whole of that
year. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(3)   For the purposes of subsection (2), a reference to the pay-roll tax

assessment under this section.</i></b>
<P>

30  	There were also a number of subsidiary issues.  
<P>

31  	First, did the plaintiffs lose their right to rely in any way on
the Notices because, without the knowledge or consent of Mr.
Singer, they had
approached the relevant tax authorities in the way described in Mr. Hall's
affidavit?  
<P>

32  	Second, was there an estoppel favouring the plaintiffs, to the
effect that the only issue between the parties was whether payroll
tax was, at
the valuation date, an actual or contingent liability?
<P>

33  	Third, if neither of the valuations was a valid and binding
valuation under the agreement, what should be done?  The plaintiffs
sought an
order setting aside the valuation, and a referral back to the valuer with full
information concerning payroll tax.  Mr.
Singer submitted that if this were
done, the valuer should also be given full information concerning the diversion
of cash from the
business, which could justify a higher valuation of the
business.  
<P>

<b><u>SUBMISSIONS</u></b>
<P>

34  	Both sides provided written submissions, which I will leave with
the papers.  Also, by leave, they provided supplementary written
submissions
after the hearing concluded, on the question of estoppel.  I will be brief in
outlining the parties' submissions.
<P>

35  	Mr. Tobias QC for the plaintiffs submitted that the combined
effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1996269/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.7</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1996269/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">8</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1996269/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">17</a> of the Act was that the employer was liable to pay tax
within the time given for lodgment of a return; and that this liability was
not
dependent on the issue of an assessment.  The agreement of 17th November 1997,
in cl.4, contemplated that the actual quantum
of liabilities might be
determined after the valuation date; and this is what happened by the issue of
the Notices.  
<P>

36  	Mr. Motbey for Mr. Singer submitted that the question for the
valuer was what a hypothetical purchaser would have paid as at
the valuation
date.  The valuer was not entitled to take into account information which
became available later:  see <u>Gosford Shire Council v. Green</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%2048%20LGRA%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 48
LGRA 201</a> at 207; <u>Barisa Pty. Limited v. Varga Bros. Investments Pty.
Limited</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%204%20ACSR%20620" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 4 ACSR 620.</a>  Under the agreement, only actual liabilities
were to be taken into account, that is, liabilities presently due and owing:
see <u>National Bank of Australasia Limited v. Mason</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1975/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1975] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%20133%20CLR%20191" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 133 CLR 191</a>;
<u>Reylan v. Lamag Holdings</u> (1992) NSWConv.R. 59,503.  It was certainly not
intended that the amount of any liability for payroll tax be determined by
payroll
tax authorities:  voluntary disclosure was prohibited by the
confidentiality agreement, and the agreement required that all relevant
matters
be determined by the valuer, who was not to be pressed by the parties.
Further, it was inequitable that the valuer be given
this material concerning
payroll tax, yet not told about the profitability of the business being higher
than that disclosed by the
accounts, by reason of the diversion of cash.
<P>

37  	In March 1999, there were disputes as to whether the liabilities
in the Notices of February 1998 were actual liabilities as
at the actual
valuation date; and the joint letter of 29th March 1999 amounted to an
agreement that if they were actual liabilities
the whole of them should come
off; and if not, nothing should come off.  In fact, the liabilities in the
Notices were the result
of exercises of discretion by the Commissioner, which
displaced any such liabilities as may have arisen earlier.  Further, they were
the result of a deal whereby the three companies were incorrectly grouped, in
return for the payroll tax authorities agreeing not
to claim from SC the
liability arising in relation to the employees of the other two companies.  The
Notices also included liabilities
for two months after the valuation date, and
penalties.  
<P>

38  	Mr. Tobias submitted that the parties treated the Notices merely
as a convenient quantification of the pre-existing statutory
liability:  there
was in fact no dispute as to quantum, but merely as to whether there was some
liability or none.  At worst for
the plaintiffs, there was a conventional
estoppel that the only issue between the parties was whether payroll tax
liability as at
the valuation date was actual or contingent.  
<P>

39  	In written submissions provided after the conclusion of the
case, Mr. Motbey first set out what he understood to be the plaintiffs'
case on
estoppel, as follows:
<P>

<b><i>a.	At all material times up to the conclusion of the March 99 variation
arrangement, the Sampson side believed that if their legal
view that the
Payroll tax legislation operated to create, from month to month, actual
liabilities (in the (apparently agreed) sense
of debts then due and payable)
was correct, then the Singer side would accept that the sum assessed by the
lady at the Payroll tax
office in February 1998 should be treated as having
been payable in April 1997.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>b.	The state of mind referred to in a. was induced by
conduct/representations of the Singer side. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>c.	In that state of mind, so induced, to their potential detriment, the
Sampson side entered into the March 1999 variation arrangement.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>d.	In the result, it is unconscionable for the Singer side to say that if
the Payroll tax legislation does operate to create actual
ascertainable
liabilities they nonetheless do not accept that the sum assessed by the lady at
the Payroll tax office in February
1998 can be treated as having been payable
in April 1997.</i></b>
<P>

40  	Mr. Motbey submitted that the allegation of belief could not be
made out merely on documents, in the absence of sworn evidence,
especially in
the situation where the parties were acting carefully with legal advice.  He
further submitted that the representation
was not established.  Even if the
assertion in Mr. Jenkins' letter of 15th February 1999, that payroll tax
liabilities arose when
Mr. Hall approached the payroll tax authorities, was
taken to be based on there being no previous liability for payroll tax, this
would not preclude later reliance on other grounds:  see <u>Shepherd v. Felt
&amp; Textiles</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1931/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1931] HCA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281931%29%2045%20CLR%20359" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1931) 45 CLR 359</a>; <u>Honner v. Ashton</u> (1979) 1 BPR
9,478.  
<P>

41  	As to the other two elements, there was no evidence of detriment
by way of a lost opportunity to get the valuer to value the
payroll tax
liability himself.  As for conscionability, it was in fact unconscionable for
Mr. and Mrs. Sampson, in breach of the
confidentiality agreement, to go to the
Payroll Tax Office, to conceal the deal that had been made there, and yet claim
that all
liability should be set off against the SC assets.
<P>

42  	In his written response, Mr. Tobias submitted that the estoppel
relied on was an estoppel by convention, namely the conduct
of relations on the
basis of an agreed or assumed set of facts:  see <u>Con-Stan Industries of
Australia Pty. Limited v. Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited</u>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20160%20CLR%20226" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 160 CLR 226</a> at 244; <u>Waltons Stores (Interstate) v.

Australia v. Verwayen</u> (1990) 170 CLR 394.  The agreed or assumed state of
facts, up to 20th August 1999, was that the valuer had completed his task and
that there was only one issue between the parties, namely, whether the payroll
tax liability was an actual or contingent liability
at the valuation date.
That both parties proceeded on this assumption or agreement appeared from the
correspondence.
<P>

43  	Thus, there was no need to prove a representation, or actual
detriment:  see <u>Grundt v. Great Boulder Pty. Goldmines Limited</u> (1937) 59
CLR at pp.674-5; <u>Waltons Stores</u> 164 CLR at 414.  In so far as it was
submitted by Mr. Motbey that any previous liability for payroll tax merged in
the Notices of
Assessment, and that the issue of the Notices irreversibly
changed the parties' position, these were incorrect and irrelevant.  Questions
of conscience were of less significance in a case founded on estoppel by
convention:  see <u>Legione v. Hateley</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20152%20CLR%20406" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 152 CLR 406</a> at 430; and in
any event, Mr. Hall's approach to the payroll tax office was in no way
unconscientious; nor was there any evidence
of a deal made on that occasion.
Even if there were such a deal, that would be irrelevant to the legal position
as at the valuation
date.  
<P>

<b><u>DECISION</u></b>
<P>

44  	In my opinion, there was a liability for payroll tax as at the
valuation date:  it is clear that SC had not paid all the payroll
tax which it
was liable to pay, and it is clear that the liability imposed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.17</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/" class="autolink_findacts">Payroll Tax Act</a> is an actual liability, not a contingent or future liability.

<P>

45  	The quantum of that liability, on the facts now before the
Court, was at least $63,868.22 in respect of the employees of SC
and at least
$87,776.55 in respect of the employees of Sector.  At least those two companies
constituted a group for the purposes
of the Act, so that SC was jointly and
severally liable for the whole of those two amounts.
<P>

46  	However, under the agreement of 17th November 1997, all
questions concerning the valuation, including the quantum and effect
of payroll
tax liability, were for the valuer to determine.  Had he addressed the
question, he could have considered inter alia (1)
how much of Sector's
liability would have been enforced against SC; (2) whether those two companies
would have been grouped with
Auspan, and the effect of such grouping; and (3)
the question of interest and penalties.  
<P>

47  	In my opinion, the approach by Mr. Hall to the payroll tax
authorities in February 1998 was not a breach of any valid agreement
between
the plaintiffs and Mr. Singer.  The provision of information relevant to the
payment of payroll tax was required by law,
and in my opinion, that obligation,
arising primarily under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.13</a> of the Act, was a continuing obligation:  this has
some confirmation from <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pta1971155/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.28(2)</a> of the Act, which requires executors and
administrators of employers to provide returns not previously provided by
deceased employers.
 If the confidentiality agreement were to be interpreted as
a promise not to comply with such legal requirements, it would to that
extent
be invalid.  However, there is some force in the submission that Mr. Hall went
beyond merely disclosing information which
he was obliged to disclose:  it can
be said that he conceded the grouping of three companies, which may not have
been justified on
the facts; and that also he obtained a concession in favour
of SC.  
<P>

48  	However, at that time, it was proposed that the valuation take
into account the assets and liabilities of all three companies,
treating them
as one entity; and I have not been referred to any evidence that the plaintiffs
were then aware that Mr. Singer claimed
that Auspan was not, along with SC and
Sector, part of a group for payroll tax purposes.  Accordingly, any concession
concerning
grouping (although affecting the threshold for payroll tax) seems of
little significance, and the tax authority's agreement not to
pursue SC
(accepting that it would otherwise be relevant, as manifesting a potential
existing at the valuation date) had no possible
relevance to the questions
actually facing the valuer.  In those circumstances, I would not find any
unconscientiousness in either
the approach to the tax authorities, or the
non-disclosure of the outcome at that time.
<P>

49  	The joint letter of 4th September 1998 noted that the financial
statements did not include the liability for payroll tax, and
enclosed the
Notices of Assessment; and these must be taken as agreed communications to the
valuer.  Still, however, there was no
change in the basis of the valuation, and
the parties were leaving it to the valuer to make what he wished of the
Notices.  Presumably,
despite the inclusion of liabilities in respect of two
months after the valuation date and the grouping of the three companies, Mr.
Singer was content to treat the Notices as an indication of the quantum of
payroll tax liability.  Again, I see no unconscientiousness
on the plaintiffs'
side at this point.  
<P>

50  	Prior to the joint letter of 29th March 1999, Mr. Jenkins raised
the point whether SC's payroll tax liabilities were actual
as at the valuation
date, or only contingent.  In my opinion, this question was raised as to SC's
liabilities for payroll tax generally,
and not as to its particular liabilities
asserted and quantified in the Notices of Assessment.  
<P>

51  	The allegation in Mr. Jenkins' letter was that the companies had
<i>no</i> payroll tax liabilities at the valuation date, not that the
<i>particular</i> payroll tax liabilities established by the Notices of
Assessment were not actual liabilities at that date:  the letter asserted,
with
reference to "the payroll tax liabilities of the companies", "there were no
such <u>actual</u> liabilities as at the valuation date".  Plainly, this is how
it was understood by Mr. Hewett, when he responded "The payroll liabilities
of
the companies were undoubtedly actual as at April 1997 and the Commissioner has
determined them ...".  So, in my opinion, that
was the issue between the
parties when the letter of March 1999 was written.  There was no issue as to
whether the quantum determined
by the Commissioner was the correct quantum to
apply to the valuation date, or whether the liabilities established by the
Notices
of Assessment were different from any actual liabilities existing at
the valuation date, or whether the valuer should not have regard
to the Notices
of Assessment as an indication of any such actual liabilities.  Those issues
were raised by the Singer interests for
the first time only after the valuation
issued.
<P>

52  	In my opinion, it was an implied term of the agreement made in
the joint letter of 23rd March 1999, that, depending upon the
true position
concerning payroll tax liability, the parties would accept one or other of the
valuations arrived at by the valuer.
 Any other view would make the request for
two valuations fatuous.  Certainly Mr. Motbey, in his primary submissions,
accepted this:
 the real dispute between the parties concerned the precise
identification of the contingency.  In my opinion, having regard to what
I have
found to be the issue then raised between the parties, the agreed contingency
was that the valuation taking into account payroll
tax liabilities should be
accepted, if the payroll tax liabilities of SC (however quantified) were actual
liabilities at the valuation
date.  I do not accept Mr. Motbey's submission
that the agreed contingency was such that the valuation without taking account
of
the liabilities should be adopted, unless the particular liabilities
established by the Notices existed at the valuation date, irrespective
of
whether other actual liabilities for payroll tax then existed.  Accordingly,
since the payroll tax liabilities of SC were actual
liabilities at the
valuation date, the agreement requires acceptance of the nil valuation.
<P>

53  	Because I take that view concerning the agreement made by the
letter of 29th March 1999, it is unnecessary for me to consider
the alternative
basis put by Mr. Tobias, namely the existence of a conventional estoppel.  
<P>

54  	However, it was also agreed in the joint letter of 29th March
1999 that the valuer should not take any account of the accounts
of Sector and
Auspan.  In my opinion, that agreement meant that the possibility of insulating
SC from the payroll tax liabilities
in relation to the employees of Sector and
Auspan became relevant, certainly to Mr. Singer's acceptance of the Notices as
an indication
of the quantum of the liabilities, and possibly to the valuation
exercise itself; and the Notices of Assessment thus became misleading
to the
extent that they suggested that the whole of the assessed amounts should be
treated without question as liabilities of SC.
 In my opinion, when that
agreement was contemplated the plaintiffs became obliged to draw the
arrangement offered by the Payroll
Tax Office to the attention of Mr. Singer,
so that if Mr. Singer wished, the valuer could be alerted to the necessity of
at least
considering how much of the amounts in the assessment could properly
be considered as liabilities of SC to be set off against SC's
assets.  The
failure of the plaintiffs to do so amounts in my opinion to a material
misrepresentation, albeit on the evidence an
innocent one.  I would infer that
the agreement in the letter of 29th March 1999 was induced, at least in part,
by that misrepresentation.
<P>

55  	No application has been made on behalf of Mr. Singer to set
aside the agreement of 29th March 1999 for misrepresentation. 
In the written
submissions supplied after the conclusion of the case, application was made to
put on a cross-claim seeking orders
setting aside the valuation and requiring a
fresh valuation, with the valuer being given information not only about payroll
tax but
also about the diversion of cash from the business; but the result of
setting aside the agreement of 29th March 1999 would merely
be to restore the
position to what it was before that agreement, so that the valuer would perform
his task on the basis of the original
agreement of November 1997, plus any
intermediate agreements and instructions, and any such further agreement or
instructions which
may be provided in the future.  No claim is made by Mr.
Singer for damages for misrepresentation:  in any event, I do not hold the
misrepresentation to be fraudulent, so that the availability of an action for
damages would be very doubtful.  
<P>

56  	I do not think this means, however, that no consequences
whatever could flow from my finding of what amounts to innocent
misrepresentation.
 The plaintiffs are seeking specific performance, and equity
has a discretion to refuse specific performance unless the plaintiffs
do
equity.  If it appeared on the material before me that the valuer would or may
have reached a different result if all circumstances
had been disclosed, then
it may well be appropriate to require the plaintiffs to do equity by accepting
that different result.  
<P>

57  	In my opinion, if the valuer had been given full information, he
could not without plain error have taken any figure less than
$63,868.22 as the
amount for payroll tax to be set off against the assets of SC.  In addition, he
could have considered whether to
add to that figure interest (having regard to
the chance of interest being remitted under s.25 of the Taxation Administration
Act
1966), penalty (having regard to the chance of penalty being remitted under
s.33 of the Taxation Administration Act), an appropriate
sum in respect of the
liability of Sector (such liability being at least $87,776.55), and an
appropriate sum for the chance that
Auspan would also be included as part of
the one group.  
<P>

58  	I have been provided with an interest calculation of $15,489.67,
making a total for SC of marginally under $80,000.00.  In
my opinion, there is
a very high probability that the valuer would have adopted a figure no less
than this sum.  There is also some
probability that, notwithstanding the
arrangement adopted in February 1998 by the Payroll Tax Office, he would have
allowed something
for the chance in April 1997 that SC would be pursued for
Sector's liability.  Furthermore, the arrangement adopted by the Payroll
Tax
Office in February 1998 was on the basis that Auspan was included in the group,
producing a figure of over $110,000.00 for payroll
tax and interest for SC
alone.  
<P>

59  	These probabilities were not put to the test, because of what I
have held to be the plaintiffs' innocent misrepresentation,
and it could be
contended that the plaintiffs should not be given the benefit of any doubt
about the matter.  However, on the whole,
I think the chance that the valuer
would have come up with a figure less than the $91,572.00 necessary to wholly
cancel out the assets
of SC is so small that it can be disregarded.  For that
reason, I do not think the plaintiffs need to make any concession in order
to
do equity.  
<P>

60  	It remains to consider Mr. Motbey's contention concerning the
extra profitability of SC which was not disclosed to the valuer.
 The matter
arises in this way.
<P>

61  	It appears to be common ground between the parties that
throughout the period from about January 1992 until about April 1997,
the
business conducted by SC and Sector provided services to tourists, some of whom
paid for their trip with Japanese yen in cash;
and that during this period,
there was a system in place under which clerks of the business kept separate
accounting records of the
yen cash receipts, which were not recorded in the
ordinary books of the business and which were not brought to account for income
tax purposes.  In the proceedings No.2035 of 1997, one of the proceedings
settled by the agreement of November 1997, the Sampsons
claimed that they had
only just found out about the yen cash system, and that Mr. Singer had
misappropriated all the yen cash and
used it for his own purposes:  in the
Statement of Claim, the Sampsons alleged that an amount estimated to exceed
$600,000.00 had
been taken during the period in question.  Mr. Singer put on a
cross-claim in which he alleged that Mr. Sampson was involved in the
yen cash
system, with intent to defraud the income tax authorities.  It appears that Mr.
Singer also denied that the amount involved
was as much as $600,000.00:  it
appears that he claimed the figure was something like one-half of that figure.

<P>

62  	Mr. Motbey submitted that it was inequitable for the Sampsons to
approach the payroll tax authorities as they had done, yet
not make a similar
approach to the income tax authorities, disclosing the income tax avoided.
Although this does not appear to be
spelt out fully in the submissions, I have
assumed that the purpose of this submission is to suggest that the
profitability of the
business was really much higher than found by the valuer,
justifying a higher valuation for the shares, presumably to an extent that
would not be balanced by any higher liability for income tax that might go with
this approach.  
<P>

63  	In my opinion, there is a difference between the income tax
situation and the payroll tax situation.  On the contention of
Mr. and Mrs.
Sampson, it would appear that the companies, and in particular SC, would not be
liable to pay income tax on the cash
money, because SC never had the benefit of
it:  on their account, it was all misappropriated by Mr. Singer.  In those
circumstances,
without resolving the factual dispute which was raised in the
earlier proceedings, I cannot make a finding that the Sampsons or SC
were under
an obligation to go to the income tax authorities and disclose the allegations
concerning the yen cash system.  Plainly,
under the terms of the main agreement
of November 1997, there was no duty on either party to disclose the allegations
concerning
the yen cash system to the valuer.  
<P>

64  	For those reasons, I do not see any force in Mr. Motbey's
contentions.  Mr. Tobias in fact objected to the material concerning
the yen
cash, as being irrelevant.  I postponed my decision on that objection.
Although I have not given effect to Mr. Motbey's submissions,
I consider that
the material is relevant, at least as context, so I do admit it.
<P>

65  	This material has brought to my attention that both parties
involved as principals in the business of SC and Sector from January
1992 until
April 1997 accept that substantial sums of cash money, some hundreds of
thousands of dollars, were taken out of the business,
with the result that
income tax which should have been paid on those sums was not paid.  In those
circumstances, I believe I should
send a copy of this judgment to the income
tax authorities, so that they can look into the matter further if they wish to
do so.
 
<P>

66  	For those reasons, in my opinion the plaintiffs should be given
substantially the relief sought in the summons.  However, the
dispute was at
least in part the result of an innocent misrepresentation by the plaintiffs,
and my tentative view is that each side
should bear its own costs.
