<P>

<b>YOUNG, J</b>
<P>

<b>FRIDAY 5 FEBRUARY 1999</b>
<P>

<b>3998/98 - CLIFFORD ARTHUR WILSON V JANN MARY HAMILTON</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b> This is an application by motion by the defendant for
leave to commence proceedings under the De Facto Relationships Act 1984 out
of
time.
<P>

2	The parties were in a de facto relationship between 1980 and February 1994
when the defendant left the relationship in Nowra and
moved to a home owned by
the parties jointly at Canley Heights.
<P>

3	The parties have three children, the youngest of whom was born in 1990 and
who lives with the defendant.
<P>

4	The defendant saw various people, qualified and unqualified, about the
problems of the end of her de facto relationship and was
involved in a
mediation conference in the Family Court at Parramatta in July 1996.  A second
mediation conference had been arranged
for 19 August 1996 but was cancelled by
the plaintiff, he says because he could not see any real possibility of the
parties reaching
any agreement.
<P>

5	The defendant instructed her present solicitor in July 1996.
<P>

6	The plaintiff had made an offer to the defendant on 22 November 1996 which
she rejected through her present solicitor.  That solicitor
made a
counter-offer by letter of 5 December 1996 which  did not receive any formal
reaction until 5 May 1998 when a further offer
was made by the plaintiff,
though there had been some intermittent discussions between the parties in the
meantime.  The letter of
5 May 1998 refers to the end of the de facto
relationship and lists the assets of that relationship.
<P>

7	On 21 September 1998 the plaintiff issued a summons for orders for sale under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66G</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a> in respect of the home at Canley Heights.
This is a home in which at least the defendant and the youngest child of the
relationship
have been living since 1994, though no rent has been paid in
respect of that occupation.  The matter came before Master McLaughlin
in
December 1998 and the learned Master by consent made an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66G</a> for
the appointment of trustees for sale, but stayed the order until today so that
the current notice of motion could be heard.
<P>

8	Section 18 of the De Facto Relationships Act requires an application to be
made before the expiration of two years from the cessation
of  cohabitation,
which would mean that the application in the instant case should have been made
no later than March 1996.
<P>

9	However, s 18 (2) enables the court:
<P>

"...where the court is satisfied, having regard to such matters as it considers
relevant, that greater hardship would be caused
to the applicant if that leave
were not granted than would be caused to the respondent if that leave were
granted"
<P>

to grant leave to a de facto partner to apply out of time.
<P>

10	There has been consideration in the authorities as to the approach of the
court to applications under this section.  It now appears
fairly clear that
there is a two-stage approach.  First, the court has to consider the statutory
precondition of greater hardship
being caused to the potential applicant, and
then has to consider the general discretionary factors that occur in almost all
applications
to extend time:  see<b> Beavan v Fallshaw</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2015%20Fam%20LR%20686" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 15 Fam LR 686</a>
and a case in Victoria on an identically worded provision decided by Gillard J
in the Supreme Court of Victoria<b> Harris v Harris</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2022%20Fam%20LR%20263" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 22 Fam LR 263.</a>
The report of the decision of Gillard J is a good illustration of how one goes
about the two-stage process.
<P>

11	The first stage, therefore, is to consider whether the applicant defendant
will suffer hardship by the time not being extended,
which would exceed the
hardship being suffered by the plaintiff if it were extended.
<P>

12	The cases under s 18 and comparable provisions in our State say that
guidance is to be found in the decisions decided under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 44(4)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Law Act 1975</a>.  In those cases it is clear that hardship in the current sense
cannot be constituted merely because the claim might be successful;
 see<b> Re
Whitford</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%204%20Fam%20LR%20754" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 4 Fam LR 754.</a>
<P>

13	However, in any particular case the loss of a possible verdict in an action
in all the circumstances in which the applicant finds
his or herself may
constitute hardship.
<P>

14	It should be noted that in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s44.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 44</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a> the court has to
consider hardship not only to the applicant but also to any child.  In the
instant statute it is only the hardship
to the applicant that must be
considered, so that I cannot take directly into account the fact that the
youngest daughter is still
only 8 years old and is living in the house, and
that she may be detrimentally affected if the house is sold under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66G</a>
order.
<P>

15	However, it does seem to me that when evaluating the hardship of the
defendant applicant one takes into account that she is primarily
concerned with
the housing of that child and so the defendant's hardship can be affected by
the circumstances of her youngest daughter.
<P>

16	The cases show that it is necessary if one is considering whether the loss
of the chance of litigation is a contributing factor
to the hardship of the
applicant to make a prima facie assessment of the prospects of success.  The
authorities show that one does
not try the application, but one looks at the
facts as disclosed in the affidavits to see whether there is a real chance of
substantial
success.
<P>

17	That is a problem in the instant case.  On the evidence before the court at
the moment the defendant has no money.  If the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66G</a> provision is followed she
will receive half the net proceeds of about $60,000, which would be inadequate
to buy another house.  If,
however, she is able to get a higher percentage than
50 percent because her known financial contribution to the relationship can
be
taken into account, she says there is a possibility that she may be able to buy
out her former husband.  On the facts and figures
this appears to be a very
slim possibility.
<P>

18	However, it is true that with a de facto relationship of 14 years producing
three children if the application were allowed to
proceed it is, on the facts
that I have at the moment, more likely than not that it would succeed for a
greater amount of money than
what the defendant would obtain under the
ordinary procedures of Common Law or Equity.
<P>

19	On the other hand, if the application under the De Facto Relationships Act
was not permitted to proceed the defendant would still
not be completely lost
because she would have rights in Equity to show that she did contribute more
than half to the purchase price.
 At the moment it would appear that this is
not a very strong case, but it is early days yet.
<P>

20	Generally speaking, on the material before me I do think that the defendant
has shown some hardship in that she currently is
living in the house rent free,
the children are living with her, she has no funds available to her, other than
what flows through
maintenance orders or the pension or supporting parents
benefits, and if she were not permitted to mount the present proceedings
she
would be deprived of the chance, perhaps not a good chance, but certainly a
chance of being able to remain in the premises by
buying out her husband in due
course.
<P>

21	On the other side one must consider the plaintiff's hardship.  He says he is
in financial difficulties with his business.  He
has had this asset, being a
half interest in the Canley Heights property, for which he is receiving no
benefit by way of occupation
fee or otherwise, and if the de facto relationship
proceedings are permitted to continue there could be quite considerable delay,
which would mount to his detriment.
<P>

22	In my view the hardship of the defendant exceeds the hardship of the
plaintiff, so that I can move to the second part of the
exercise of
discretion.
<P>

23	It is normal, but not imperative, that the applicant show some real reason
for the delay.  With great imagination Mr Lovas of
counsel for the defendant
put up five possible reasons why there was a delay in this case; namely, (1)
Ignorance of legal rights;
  (2)  Fears for the defendant's safety if she sued
the plaintiff;  (3)  Ongoing negotiations on the basis that there was a claim;
(4)  The defendant's impecuniosity;  and (5)  Time taken in concern for her
sister who was very ill.
<P>

24	I find it very hard to accept the claim of ignorance. The defendant was
advised both by lay women who were involved in this sort
of case day in day out
for years, and had conferences with solicitors. Indeed she would seem to imply
that her present solicitor
never told her about time limits and it is
significant that the present solicitor has not filed any evidence.
<P>

25	Although there is no contrary material, the plaintiff, of course, cannot see
into the defendant's mind or know what she did with
her solicitors, and so it
is necessary if a case of ignorance is pleaded to have some confirmation before
a judge will be able to
cast away his suspicion.  If the main ground were
ignorance I would not accept it.
<P>

26	I do, however, consider that the third point made is one which is a very
strong reason to explain the delay on behalf of the
defendant. The only claim
that the defendant had was a claim under the  De Facto Relationships Act.  The
plaintiff permitted the
defendant to continue to live in the home at Canley
Heights. There were desultory negotiations between 1996 and 1998 over what the
defendant should receive as a result of the wash-up of the relationship and,
indeed, even in 1998 the plaintiff's solicitor is talking
in terms of the
settlement of the property interests following the end of the de facto
relationship.
<P>

27	Nobody ever wants to go to court both because it is unpleasant and
expensive, so where there are negotiations taking place, where
the parties know
or ought to have known that the time limit is up, there is a very strong factor
to say that no-one is prejudiced
by extending the time.  Moreover, it does not
appear that there is any forensic prejudice to either party by the delay.  It
may be
on either or both sides there has been the loss of some documents, but
that will even itself out and otherwise the witnesses are
still available.
<P>

28	 I am concerned that permitting this application will permit delays and that
may detrimentally affect the plaintiff, but on the
other hand to some extent
making sure this litigation does not drag on is a matter which his solicitors
can control.
<P>

29	I am more concerned that at the end of the day the defendant may receive
very much the same as she would under a s 66G order.
 However, Mr Lovas says I
should not speculate about that because it may well be that the fact that the
plaintiff has sold the Queensland
property, which if an application were made
earlier  would have been the source of an award to the defendant, may very well
lead
to the court awarding the defendant a greater share than 50 percent in the
Canley Heights property.
<P>

30	I was tempted for a while to make conditions on the order that if the
defendant did not obtain more than she got under the s
66G order she should pay
the costs of the proceedings. However, on consideration I think it is probably
better to forecast that as
a possibility, but leave that to the Judge or Master
who hears the actual case.
<P>

31	Accordingly, after a full consideration of the factors involved I think it
is appropriate that I do extend the time.  So that
I make order 1 in the notice
of motion of 10 December 1998.  The cross-claim is to be filed no later than 1
March 1999.  I stay the
order under s 66G made by the Master until further
order.  I stand the matter over to the Registrar's list for mention on 1 March
1999 at 9.30 am.  I reserve the costs of the motion.
<P>

                                                   oOo
<P>
