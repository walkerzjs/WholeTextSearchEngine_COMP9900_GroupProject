<b>1539/99 RE REDROCK MEDIA PTY LTD &amp; ANORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (EX TEMPORE)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR: In this matter the plaintiff John Vouris has made an ex parte
application to the Court today for orders with respect
to three companies,
namely, Redrock Media Pty Ltd (in liquidation) (`Redrock'), Planet Media Group
Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed)
(`Planet') and The Axis Group (Aust) Pty Ltd
(Administrator Appointed) (`Axis').
<P>

2	Redrock, Planet and Axis are related companies with inter-company debit and
credit accounts and common directors.  They are insolvent.
<P>

3	Mr Vouris seeks an order pursuant to s 444B(2)(b) of the Corporations Law
that the time for Planet and Axis to execute Deeds of
Company Arrangement
pursuant to resolutions of the creditors of those companies made on 10 February
1999 be extended up to and including
Monday 7 March 1999. He also seeks on
order that he be given leave to appoint himself administrator of Redrock
pursuant to s 436B(2)
of the Corporations Law.  
<P>

4	The basis for these applications is as follows.  On 17 December 1998 Mr
Vouris was appointed the administrator of each of the
three companies.  In
accordance with his statutory duties he convened a first meeting of creditors
and then second meeting of creditors
for each company.  The latter meetings
were originally convened for 20 January 1999 but were in each case adjourned to
10 February
1999. On 10 February Mr Vouris was required to be absent from New
South Wales for business reasons and he appointed Mr Murray Godfrey,
who is a
chartered accountant employed by Mr Vouris' firm, to chair the three meetings
of creditors.  Arrangements were made for
Mr Godfrey to exercise proxies and to
vote under powers of attorney which had been made in favour of the chairman of
those meetings.

<P>

5	At the adjourned meetings on 10 February 1999, creditors considered Mr
Vouris' report, as administrator, in which he recommended
that each company
enter into interlocking deeds of company arrangement. The meetings for Planet
and Axis were duly held and the creditors
resolved to authorise each company to
enter into a deed of company arrangement as recommended. Consequently under
Corporations Law
s 444B it would be necessary, unless the Court makes an order
under s 444B(2)(b), that the deeds of company arrangement be entered
into by
this Wednesday 3 March 1999.
<P>

6	As to Redrock, a problem arose in this way.  When a vote was taken on the
proposal to enter into a deed of company arrangement
Mr Godfrey made a mistake
with respect to the value of the debt of one of the creditors who voted against
the motion.  He then calculated
that however the proxies in his favour were
used, the resolution would fail.  Therefore, he  did not vote the proxies in
favour of
the motion to approve the deed of company arrangement. Consequently,
the resolution to enter into the deed of company arrangement
failed and
further, it was resolved that the company should be placed into liquidation.

<P>

7	The result is that the equivalent deeds of company arrangement for Planet and
Axis have been approved by the creditors but the
deed of company arrangement
for Redrock has not been approved and that company is now in liquidation, with
Mr Vouris as liquidator
rather than administrator under the deed. That creates
a problem for Mr Vouris in his role as administrator of the other two
companies,
because the deeds of company arrangement are interrelated in such a
fashion that the deeds for the other two companies cannot be
effectively
implemented and acted upon in the absence of an equivalent deed for Redrock.
<P>

8	The ingenuity of counsel has been applied to that problem with the result
that the present application comes before me. I am persuaded
that provided
certain safeguards are built into the orders I make, it is proper that I should
exercise my discretion under the provisions
to which I have referred. As far as
s 444B(2)(b) is concerned, the orders sought will extend the time for executing
the deeds for
Planet and Axis for a period of only 7 days, at this stage.  In
those circumstances the concerns which the Court might otherwise
have,
especially as regards possible prejudice to parties affected by the moratorium
produced by an administration under ss 440A-440D,
is minimised.  
<P>

9	The order sought under s 436B(2) is within a narrow compass. Mr Vouris, as
liquidator, is empowered by writing to appoint an administrator
of Redrock if
he thinks that the company is insolvent or is likely to become insolvent at
some future time (s 436B(1)).  His affidavit
evidence is that he believes the
company is insolvent.  The only reason that the leave of the Court is sought is
to enable him to
appoint himself as administrator.  In this case I have no
difficulty reaching the conclusion that that leave is appropriate to be
given.
He is already administrator of the other two companies under interlocking deeds
of company arrangement.
<P>

10	The safeguards which I have in mind have been built into the short minutes
of orders which counsel has handed up. They amount
in effect to an undertaking
by Mr Vouris to ensure that all creditors are properly notified of what is
happening and that a further
meeting the creditors of Redrock be held no later
than 29 March 1999 to give them the opportunity to consider whether the deed of
company arrangement should be entered into.
<P>

11	Accordingly, counsel for the plaintiff having handed up short minutes of
orders, which I initial and date for the purposes of
identification, upon the
undertaking by Mr Vouris set out in that document, I make orders 1, 2 and 3.
