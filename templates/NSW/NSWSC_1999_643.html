<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  These proceedings relate to the collapse on 6 January 1989 of a
bridge over the Macquarie River at Wellington.  There
are before the Court
three notices of motion.  The first is a notice of motion brought in
proceedings 55034 of 1998.  In those proceedings
the Roads and Traffic
Authority of New South Wales is the plaintiff.  Messrs W L H Comerford, K B
Comerford and William K Comerford
trading as Yuringo Pastoral Co are the first
to fourth defendants inclusive.  The first to fourth defendants are also
cross-claimants,
and the Roads and Traffic Authority is a cross-defendant.
<P>

2	The notice of motion is brought by W L H Comerford, K B Comerford, W K
Comerford trading as Yuringo Pastoral Co.  It seeks an
order that the report of
Mr G C Verge dated  14 December 1998 be adopted, save for the passage on p 5 of
the report commencing with
the words "repairs made from time to time" through
to the words "under controlled conditions".  The motion also seeks orders with
respect to costs.
<P>

3	Motions in precisely the same form save in respect of the costs orders sought
have been filed in proceedings 55036 of 1998 by
Mr W. K. Comerford, and in
proceedings 55035 of 1998 by J L H Comerford, K B Comerford, and W K Comerford
trading as Yuringo Pastoral
Co.
<P>

4	In proceedings 55036 of 1998 Telstra Corporation Limited is the plaintiff.
Mr W K Comerford is the first defendant.  The Roads
and Traffic Authority of
New South Wales is the second defendant.  Mr W K Comerford is also a
cross-claimant in those proceedings,
and the Roads and Traffic Authority of New
South Wales is the cross-defendant.
<P>

5	In the third set of proceedings 55035 of 1998 Mr G H Welling and W B Welling
are the first and second plaintiffs.  W K Comerford
is first defendant.  J L H
Comerford, K B Comerford and W K Comerford trading as Yuringo Pastoral Co are
respectively the second,
third and fourth defendants and cross-claimants.  The
fifth defendant and cross-claimant is the Roads and Traffic Authority of New
South Wales.
<P>

6	The proceedings arise following the making of an order that pursuant to Pt 72
r 2(1) of the rules of court in each proceeding:
<P>

	<i>"The question of the cause(s) of the collapse of the Wellington Bridge on 6
January 1989 to be referred to Geoffrey Verge, consulting
engineer, to inquire
and report to the Court on that question."</i>
<P>

7	It is necessary to briefly outline the position in respect of the three sets
of proceedings.  The outline is not intended to summarise
the pleadings but to
give an overview of the pleadings.
<P>

8	In proceedings 55034 of 1998 the plaintiff, being the owner of a bridge,
claims damages following the alleged destruction of the
bridge by the
defendants or by reason of actions of the defendants.  The plaintiff alleges
that the first defendant W K Comerford,
in attempting to transport an excavator
across the bridge, caused the dipstick of the excavator to collide with the
portal truss
of the bridge, thus causing the bridge to collapse.  The plaintiff
alleges that the first defendant Mr W K Comerford is liable in
negligence,
having loaded the excavator in such a way as to exceed the bridge clearance.
In the same proceedings the plaintiff alleges
that the second, third and fourth
defendants as employers of the first defendant are vicariously liable for his
negligence.  Alternatively
the plaintiff claims a statutory right to recovery
under s 68 of the <i>State Roads Act</i> 1986.
<P>

9	In proceedings 55035 of 1998, the plaintiffs were the owners of the excavator
and other equipment being transported by the low
loader alleged to have been
driven by the first defendant under contract with the second to fourth
defendants.  Whilst in transit
the allegation is that the goods were damaged
following the collapse of the bridge.  The plaintiffs claim damages from the
first
to fourth defendants in negligence and/or for breach of contract for loss
incurred following collapse of the bridge.  Alternatively
the plaintiffs claim
damages from the fifth defendant in negligence and/or public nuisance.
<P>

10	The first, second, third and fourth defendants repeat their defence and
cross-claim in proceedings 55034 of 1998.
<P>

11	In the final set of proceedings Telstra is the plaintiff and it claims
damages in negligence following damage caused, or said
to have been caused, by
the first defendant to Telstra's cable situated near the bridge.  Telstra
alleges that the first defendant
Mr W K Comerford damaged the cable pursuant to
the collision of the low loader with the bridge.  Further or in the alternative
the
plaintiffs claim damages from the third defendant being the RTA in
negligence.
<P>

	<b>THE NOTICES OF MOTION</b>
<P>

12	The hearing of the notices of motion today follows directions given in that
regard on the basis that at the commencement of the
hearing the notices of
motion would be filed, notification of the notices of motion apparently having
been given to the relevant
material parties.  In those circumstances, without
effective objection, the notices of motion were filed at the commencement of
the
hearing and an order was made that the motions be heard instanter.
<P>

13	Written submissions pursuant to earlier directions have been provided to the
Court by the parties who by their legal representatives
have appeared today,
namely by the Comerfords and by the Roads and Traffic Authority.  Appearances
for the Comerfords are Mr Graves
of Senior Counsel and Mr Pesman.  Appearances
on behalf of the Roads and Traffic Authority have been today Mr M Rudge of
Senior Counsel.
 Mr G H Welling has appeared in person.  
<P>

14	Following the submissions taken before the luncheon adjournment, the Court
indicated that an ex tempore judgment would be delivered
at 2pm.  At 2pm Mr
Curtis solicitor appearing for Telstra was in court, but he indicated that he
had no objection to the orders being
made in the notices of motion in so far as
the whole report being adopted was concerned and did not wish to address any
further submissions
to the Court in relation to the matter.  Mr Welling being
invited to do so, had no submissions to advance in relation to the matters
the
subject of the notice of motion, but indicated a desire that the whole
proceedings be expedited so that his suit can be determined
as speedily as
possible.  He is in the somewhat invidious position of having sued both the
Comerfords and the Roads and Traffic Authority,
assuming that one or other may
be liable and having as yet no result in the proceedings.
<P>

15	It is convenient then to commence with describing the structure of the
referee's report.  The referee's report is a report which
is in twelve
sections.  The sections are divided as follows.  Section 1, `Introduction';
Section 2, `Procedure';  Section 3, `Principal
issues in dispute';  Section 4,
`Legal principles';  Section 5, `The bridge';  Section 6, `Sequence of events
in the collapse'; 
Section 7, `Witnesses' accounts';  7.1, `Loading the
excavator';  7.2, `On the road to Wellington';  7.3, `The accident scene';
7.4,
`Generally';  8, `Damage to the principal elements';  8.1, `Point of
impact, the entry portal truss and top of the dipstick';  8.2,
`The hydraulic
cylinder and ram';  8.3, `The low loader deck, beavertail and loading ramp
(tailgate)';  8.4, `The underside of the
loading ramps and low loader triaxle';
8.5, `The king pin and turntable';  8.5, `The bridge deck and bottom chord';
Section 9, `Reconciling
the damage with the parties' contentions';  9.1, `The
impact zone at the top of the dipstick and the entry portal';  9.2, `The dent
in the tailgate and its match with the bucket';  9.3, `The underside of the
loading ramp and the rear of the low loader';  9.4, `The
leading edge of the
second slab and its being upside down on the top of the first and third slabs';
Section 10, `Analyses of slab
buckling';  Section 11, `Statistical
probability';  Section 12, `Summary and conclusion'.
<P>

16	The referee, a structural engineer, commenced section 3 in the following
terms:
<P>

	<i>`Although the parties agree on many details of the collapse, there is a
fundamental disagreement on the direct cause of the impact
between the
excavator and the bridge.</i>
<P>

<i>	The RTA (including Welling and Telstra) contends that the height of the
excavator on the low loader exceeded the clearance height
of the bridge.  Thus
the highest part of the excavator being the top of the dipstick hit the
overhead  bracing, became entangled
with it and brought the bridge down.</i>
<P>

<i>	Comerford contends that the excavator was loaded such that there was
sufficient clearance between its highest part the top of the
dipstick of the
excavator and the overhead bracing stump.  But the bridge deck failed by
buckling so that a concrete slab rose up
under the low loader causing it to
rotate and lift the dipstick so that its top hit the overhead bracing became
entangled and thus
brought the bridge down.'</i>
<P>

17	From time to time the referee refers to these submissions as `the
plaintiff's submissions', or `scenario', and `the defendants'
submissions', or
`scenario'.
<P>

18	In referring to `the plaintiff', generally in the course of this judgment, I
am to be taken as referring to the Roads and Traffic
Authority, and in
referring to `the defendants' generally in this judgment, I am to be taken as
referring to the Comerfords.
<P>

19	The plaintiff has essentially advanced, as I have understood Mr Rudge of
Senior Counsel, three alternative submissions.  The
effect of the first
submission is to focus on the referee's dealing with the condition of the
bridge, concluding with the section
to which I have already referred,
beginning:
<P>

	<i>`According to the RTA maintenance file, Exhibit D4(1), the bridge has a
history of movement and distress requiring repairs for many
years...'</i>
<P>

20	The plaintiff then draws attention to the fact that the referee, having
detailed the number of stress features continued using
the words which I have
referred to:
<P>

	<i>`Repairs made from time to time appear to have been sufficient to provide a
reasonable level of serviceability under regular heavy
traffic.  Also the
bridge safely carried the occasional abnormal load of some 250 tonnes, albeit
under controlled conditions.'</i>
<P>

21	The plaintiff, by Mr Rudge, asserts that beyond the positive finding by the
referee that the plaintiff effected repairs on the
bridge, the referee made no
other finding with respect to the condition of the bridge, neither that it was
poorly constructed or
poorly maintained.  As such the plaintiff submits that
the referee made no finding of any act or omission by the plaintiff causative
of the defendants' loss or of that sustained by Welling and Telstra in the
associated matters.  In the result, if the plaintiff's
first submission be
accepted, and if the report is adopted in its entirety, the appropriate orders
on the plaintiff's submissions
are that the claim, the cross-claim and the
associated claims be dismissed.
<P>

22	The plaintiff's second submission, which was not the subject of written
submissions but was the subject of submissions advanced
from the bar table, was
that because of the findings in s 5 of the report, which it was said, negatived
the defendants' case as presented
to the referee, it was not open to the
referee to find, what is referred to by Mr Rudge as the toggle/buckle scenario,
as having
occurred.  In the result, on the plaintiff's second submissions as I
understood those submissions, the whole of the report should
be rejected.
<P>

23	I interpolate that the `toggle/buckle' scenario to which Mr Rudge referred
and to which Mr Graves has also referred, is a reference
to the theory that the
leading edge of the second slab from the Dubbo end of the span "popped up"
after the prime-mover passed over
it and just prior to the first wheels of the
tri-axle reaching the joint between the first and second slabs.  
<P>

24	The plaintiff's second submission as I understood Mr Rudge today, may be
expressed as follows.
<P>

1.	The plaintiff accepts that the question of legal liability in respect of the
subject events was not before the referee.
<P>

2.	The plaintiff submits that nevertheless all technical and factual issues
relevant to the cause of the bridge's collapse were
before the referee.  These
are said to have necessarily included the legal and factual issues contended
for by the Comerfords.
<P>

3.	The plaintiff then submits that the referee was required to decide as a
matter of fact whether the pleaded allegations in relation
to the state of the
bridge, its design and maintenance were made out.  The submission as I have
understood it is that the condition
of the bridge, its design and its
maintenance were central to matters the referee had to decide.
<P>

4.	The submission is that the defendants' case before the referee was that the
toggle/buckle movement resulted from a combination
of:
<P>

	<i>	</i>(a)  defective design, and/or
<P>

		(b)  poor maintenance.
<P>

5.	The plaintiff submits that the burden of the referee's decision was to
negative the defendants' case, in other words to in substance
find that the
toggle/buckle movement did not result from a combination of defective design
and poor maintenance.
<P>

6.	The plaintiff submits that the referee:
<P>

	<i>	</i>(a)  did not find defective design.
<P>

	(b)  did find that maintenance was sufficient to provide a reasonable level of
serviceability.
<P>

7.	The plaintiff then submits that the ultimate finding of the referee that the
cause of the collapse was the toggle/buckle, is
inconsistent with the matters
referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph above, and that no reason
was given by the referee
for this suggested inconsistency.
<P>

8.	The plaintiff then submits that by adopting the toggle/buckle scenario, the
referee has forgotten that he had already decided
in a fashion which removes
the only substratum upon which to base such a finding, namely that there had
been no defective design
or poor maintenance.
<P>

9.	Hence the plaintiff's submission that the referee was tasked with bringing
down findings of fact which were capable of providing
the foundation for the
ultimate determination of legal liability in the proceedings.
<P>

25	In my judgment those submissions are without substance.  They fail at
threshold in misconstruing the terms of reference.  The
terms did not refer to
the referee the question of determining the issue as to whether any act or
omission of RTA constituted negligence
as pleaded, or constituted a breach of a
statutory duty.
<P>

26	No evidence was adduced before the Court to the effect that the submissions
of the defendant before the referee were or were
confined in the manner
suggested in the plaintiff's submission.  The submissions before the referee
which appear to have been included
as annexures to the report do not assist.
<P>

27	A close reading of the report makes clear it seems to me, that the referee
did not treat with the detailed particulars of negligence
and/or breach of
statutory duty given in the pleadings.  It is inappropriate presently to now
repeat the pleadings in the proceedings.
 Suffice it to say that the material
affirmative and in some cases defensive pleadings, descend, as one might
expect, to a great
deal of particular detail in the particulars as to the
negligence or breaches of statutory duty relied upon.  One matter which was
the
subject of submissions by Mr Rudge after the Court raised it with him, concerns
for example the cross-claim in proceedings 55034
of 1998.  In para 11 of that
cross-claim the cross-claimants, that is to say the Comerfords trading as
Yuringo Pastoral Co, plead
that damage was caused by the Roads and Traffic
Authority's public nuisance by rendering the highway dangerous for users
thereof.
 The very first particular in a line of some eighteen particulars
reads as follows:
<P>

	<i>"The public nuisance occurred by reason of the cross-defendant...failing to
adequately investigate the subsoil conditions below the
bridge piers."</i>
<P>

28	No reference appears to have been made anywhere in the report to the subsoil
conditions below the bridge piers, let alone to
whether or not, and if so in
what circumstances owners of bridges such as the RTA routinely investigate
subsoil conditions below
bridge piers, or ought in the circumstances of this
bridge, have been alerted to the need, if need there in fact was, to so
investigate.
<P>

29	As I understood Mr Rudge, the plaintiff accepts that what the referee did
was to find a proximate cause for the collapse of the
bridge.
<P>

30	To my mind the referee in para 5 of the report to which so much attention
was addressed in submissions in writing and from the
bar table dealt with two
topics.  The first is the topic of repairs from time to time made to the
bridge.  This was a question of
fact.  In the referee's opinion based on the
evidence, these appear to have been sufficient to provide a reasonable level of
serviceability
under regular heavy truck traffic.  Secondly dealt with was the
topic of abnormal loads.  As a matter of fact, the finding was that
the bridge
safely carried the occasional abnormal load of some 250 tonnes, albeit under
controlled conditions.
<P>

31	In the result to my mind the second bracket of submissions of the
plaintiff's are without substance and require to be rejected.
<P>

32	The third submissions by the plaintiff, as I have understood them, are that
the report should not be adopted, save for the whole
of Section 5.  This is
because, it is submitted, that the referee did not place appropriate weight on
a number of evidentiary matters,
including the lay, engineering or the
statistical evidence presented by the plaintiff.  The plaintiff here asserts
that rather than
reach a view on balance, the referee based his conclusions
solely on the physical evidence of damage to the low loader.  The plaintiff
asserts that the Court should not adopt the report as it "could not have the
required degree of comfortable satisfaction that the
right conclusion had been
reached" - plaintiff's written submissions para 31.
<P>

33	Here again to my mind the plaintiff's submissions are one without substance.
I deal in some detail with the content of the submission.
 
<P>

34	In support of the submission the plaintiff contends that the referee did not
place appropriate weight on a number of evidentiary
matters before him, as I
have said, including the lay, engineering or statistical evidence presented by
the plaintiff.  The plaintiff
then asserts that rather than reach a view on
balance, the referee based his conclusions solely on the physical evidence of
damage
to the low loader.
<P>

35	A close reading of the report however indicates that while the referee may
have been persuaded by the physical evidence of damage
to the low loader, he
did not fail to consider all the evidentiary matters before him.
<P>

36	The referee treated with the evidence adduced in the following four
categories:
<P>

	(a)  Lay witnesses or non-technical evidence.
<P>

	(b)  Physical evidence of the structural damage and its interpretation.
<P>

	(c)  Engineering analysis of possible failure models.
<P>

	(d)  The probability of certain events occurring, based on statistical
assessment [report p 3].
<P>

	<b>Treatment by the Referee of the Lay Evidence</b>
<P>

37	At pp 6 to 10 of the report the referee gave detailed consideration to lay
evidence given by Mr Comerford, Mr Welling, Mr Marks
and Messrs Blain and
Cather.
<P>

38	Clearly there is conflict between the accounts of principal witnesses for
the parties in relation to the loading of the excavator.
 On the one hand, Mr
Comerford asserts that he loaded the excavator onto the truck in such a way
that the dip stick would have been
at a height which would enable it to pass
safely under the Wellington bridge.  On the other hand, Mr Welling gave
evidence for the
plaintiff.  His evidence was to the effect that the excavator
was loaded into a position which the experts agreed would have placed
the dip
stick in a position of collision with the lower chord of the portal's truss.
Mr Marks also gave evidence for the plaintiff.
 His evidence was to the effect
that the dip stick was in an upright position, which would have brought it into
collision with the
bridge.
<P>

39	After reviewing the lay evidence the referee concluded:
<P>

	<i>"I have reviewed all the lay evidence and conclude that it is far from
conclusive as to which scenario should be supported."</i>  [Report p 10]
<P>

	<i>"The non-technical evidence discussed in s 7 covers the witnesses' accounts
of the loading of the excavator, its transportation to
Wellington and the scene
of the accident.  I find this evidence inconclusive and not sufficient to
decide the issues in contention</i>."  [Report p 25]
<P>

40	It is then said to have been manifestly unreasonable for the referee not to
have come to a finding as to the testimony of particularly
an independent third
party.
<P>

41	While I accept the respective parties' submissions that the referee did not
expressly prefer one account over the other, I reject
the assertion by the
plaintiff that the "referee made no attempt to resolve these conflicts"
[plaintiff's submissions para 19], and
that "his error is to fail to come back
to the evidence, reach a view concerning the conflict it contains, give the
result weight
and then place that on the appropriate side of the scale"
[plaintiff's submissions para 20].  Ultimately the referee at report p
27
accepts the defendants' scenario as providing a coherent explanation of all the
evidence.  The referee it seems to me clearly
weighed all the evidence and came
down in favour of the defendants' submissions.
<P>

42	As opposed to the plaintiff's submissions in this regard, the effect of the
referee's conclusion was that the lay evidence was
unsatisfactory and not
capable of assisting him in his decision [see para 10 of the defendants'
submissions].  In any event, had
the referee made an express finding on the lay
evidence, it is highly questionable whether that finding could have assisted
the plaintiff.
 The referee made a number of comments adverse to the
credibility of Mr Welling, the principal lay witness for the plaintiff, and
highlighted the inconsistencies in Mr Marks' evidence.
<P>

	<b>Treatment by the Referee of the Physical Evidence</b>
<P>

43	The referee clearly attached considerable weight to the physical evidence.
His report reads inter alia:
<P>

	<i>"Given the uncertainty of the lay evidence, it becomes necessary to examine
the damage carefully."</i> [Report p 10]
<P>

44	The referee does however note that:
<P>

	<i>"One should bear in mind that some damage may have been pre-existing or
caused by salvage operations after the accident."</i> [Report p 11]
<P>

45	To my mind all that the quoted passage to which I have referred from p 10 of
the report suggests is that in the referee's view,
the physical evidence had to
be examined with care.  This is not to accept the plaintiff's submission that
the report should be viewed
as showing that notwithstanding the referee's
caution with respect to the physical damage, he is shown to have elevated that
material
into the sole determinant of the case.
<P>

46	Following discussion with the experts, who appear to have spent considerable
time examining the damaged parts of the bridge,
excavator and low loader trying
to reconcile their respective explanations for the accident, the referee
concluded that four items
of physical damage were critical [report p 26].
<P>

47	The plaintiff submits that of the four elements identified "one is
definitely neutral, another is possibly neutral, and two may
favour, but not
necessarily so, the defendant" [plaintiff's submissions para 24].
<P>

48	I accept the defendants' submission that this summary is incorrect.  The
referee's conclusions in relation to each item were
in fact as follows:
<P>

	(a)	In relation to the damage to the portal truss and dipstick:
<P>

	<i>"I conclude that either scenario could explain the damage to the portal
truss and dipstick." </i> [Report p 7.10]
<P>

To my mind this conclusion can fairly be said to be neutral.
<P>

	(b)  In relation to the dent in the tailgate:
<P>

	<i>"However, the defendants' position with the bucket against the tailgate is
more likely to fit the damage..." </i> [Report p 18]
<P>

To my mind this conclusion favours the defendant.
<P>

	(c)	In relation to the underside of the loading ramp 	and the rear of the low
loader:
<P>

	<i>"The defendants' scenario provides the more likely explanation..."</i>
[Report p 19]
<P>

To my mind this conclusion appears to favour the defendant.
<P>

	(d)	In relation to the second slab:
<P>

	<i>"Subject to the analysis of slab buckling, I conclude that the defendants'
scenario is the more likely explanation of the damage to
the second slab and
its being upside down." </i> [Report p 21]
<P>

49	It is somewhat difficult to be certain as to how to categorise this
conclusion considering the referee's treatment of the slab
buckling analysis.
However it is arguable that this conclusion favours the defendant.
<P>

	<b>Treatment by the Referee of the Engineering Analysis</b>
<P>

50	The referee deals with this matter from pp 21 to 24 of his report.  His
conclusion at p 24 is:
<P>

	<i>"Having reviewed the competing arguments of the experts for each scenario I
have some difficulty in reconciling the calculated forces
and mathematical
models with the physical action at the slab joints.  I conclude that the
mathematical process relies heavily on
the assumed properties of the concrete
and the geometry.  These are highly variable and consequently the end results
are not sufficiently
reliable to decide the issue."</i>
<P>

51	The plaintiff submits that the engineering analysis of possible failure
modes occupied the bulk of the hearing and the bulk of
the experts' reports.
The plaintiff's submission is that the plaintiff's experts contended that the
defendants' scenario was scientifically
impossible and that the defendants
contended that within some parameters it was possible.
<P>

52	Paragraphs 26 through to 28 of the plaintiff's submissions are in the
following terms:
<P>

	<i>'26.	It was this matter which occupied the bulk of the hearing and the bulk
of the expert reports.  The plaintiff's experts contended
that the defendant's
scenario was scientifically impossible, and the defendant's contended that
within some parameters it was possible.</i>
<P>

<i>	27.	The referee deals with this matter in section 10 of his report
commencing on page 21.  His conclusion in the final paragraph
of the section on
page 24 is:</i>
<P>

<i>	"Having reviewed the competing arguments of the experts for each scenario,
I have some difficulty in reconciling the calculated forces
and mathematical
models with the physical action of the slab joints.  I conclude that the
mathematical process relies heavily on
the assumed properties of the concrete
and the geometry.  These are highly variable and consequently, the end results
are not </i><cite>sufficiently reliable to decide the issue"</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	As with the lay evidence, the referee treats this material in
isolation.</i>
<P>

<i>	28.	He returns to the question in his section 13 summary on page 26 and
finds:</i>
<P>

<i>	"The conclusion from these analyses is that a buckling failure is
unpredictable and neither of the competing scenarios can be ruled
out".</i>
<P>

<i>	If neither scenario can be ruled out there must be an implicit acceptance
by the referee of the possibility of the plaintiff's scenario,
yet no
recognition of this is given.'</i>
<P>

53	I reject the concluding proposition put in the plaintiff's said submissions.
I do not accept upon a reading of the report, that
it is correct to say that if
neither scenario can be ruled out there must be an implicit acceptance by the
referee of the possibility
of the plaintiff's scenario, yet no recognition of
this is given.
<P>

	<b>Treatment of Statistical Assessment</b>
<P>

54	Here the plaintiff points out that the referee deals with the matter in s 11
of his report commencing on p 24.  The plaintiff
points out that the referee
concludes that whilst the combination of events necessary to give rise to the
defendants' scenario is
"one in several million" this does not rule out the
occurrence of the event.  The plaintiff points out that in reaching his
conclusion,
the referee however treats this matter as being of no consequence
stating:
<P>

	<i>"The statistical assessment advanced by the plaintiff is an interesting
mathematical exercise that shows a very low probability of
occurrence for the
postulated toggle/buckling (the defendants' scenario).  However, in practical
terms this is not unusual for accidents
involving collisions and engineering
structures.  Fortunately these are rare events and as such would have a low
probability."</i>
<P>

55	The plaintiffs then submit that one chance in several million is not `a low
probability' as the referee, so the plaintiff submits,
seemed to think.  The
plaintiffs' submission is that it is almost an impossibility, a factor which
should weigh, the plaintiffs submit,
very heavily in their favour upon a proper
assessment of all of the evidence.
<P>

56	It is then submitted by the plaintiff that adoption of the report would be
unsafe.  The plaintiff's submission is that the Court
could not have the
required degree of comfortable satisfaction that the right conclusion has been
reached.
<P>

57	The defendants' responsive submission in relation to the question of
statistical assessment is one which seems to me to be of
substance.  The
defendants here point out that the question is not what was the absolute
probability of the defendants' scenario,
which is admitted to be low, but
rather it is a question of relative probability.  The defendants submit, and I
accept that as the
referee pointed out at report p 26.2, bridge collapses are
rare and therefore inherently unlikely.  A bridge collapse having occurred,
the
submission is that the referee was required to determine a more probable cause.
The submission is that the mere fact of the improbability
of the defendants'
scenario does not invalidate the referee's conclusion.  I accept that
submission.
<P>

58	There is a further matter which the plaintiffs, after closing their
submissions elected to put forward in terms of tendering
material.  The
material which was then tendered without objection will be marked exhibit P1,
and comprises pp 380 through to 383
of the transcript of the hearing before the
referee of November 6, 1998.
<P>

59	This is a matter which the plaintiffs have dealt with in their written
submissions at para 25.  Paragraph 25 reads:
<P>

	<i>"Furthermore, in deciding that item 1 is neutral, the referee has ignored
the agreement of the experts (Transcript 381.47-57) that
the defendants'
scenario could only work by arbitrarily lowering the speed of the truck from
its speed of forty kilometres per hour
(as established by the evidence) to
thirty kilometres per hour.  If the referee had acknowledged this fact, item 1
should have been
placed on the plaintiff's side of the scale."</i>
<P>

60	The defendants submit that the extent of the referee's task was to decide
between two competing scenarios and that no alternative
was advanced.  In that
circumstance the defendants' submission is that it does not assist the
plaintiff to assert that a matter was
"possibly neutral", where a finding that
a matter was more likely to favour the defendants supports a conclusion that
the defendants'
scenario was more likely than that of the plaintiff's.
<P>

61	The defendants then submit that the impact speed was one of a substantial
number of variables and refer to exhibit P1 at p 382.14
to .19 where the
referee asks the question of Dr Saleh:
<P>

	<i>"You are saying it is a sensitive calculation.  There are a large number of
variables that can be input into the calculation from
which you can get a host
of results, some of which will produce the desired result which fits the known
facts.  ..."</i>
<P>

62	I accept the defendants' submission that the fact that one of those
variables may have been incorrect (although the defendants
do not accept that
that is the case), does not invalidate a finding that the damage is explained
by either scenario.
<P>

63	Here again as I have understood the submissions put forward by Mr Rudge of
Senior Counsel the suggested failure by the referee
in relation to this issue
of speed and experts' agreement constitutes a manifest error, such that the
Court could not and should
not be satisfied, let alone "comfortably satisfied",
that the right conclusion has been reached.
<P>

64	I did not understand there to be a contest as to the principles which inform
the exercise by the Court of its undoubted discretion
in the matter of adopting
or rejecting or otherwise ordering in relation to a report of a reference
following a Pt 72 reference.
<P>

65	The principles which inform the Court's discretion whether and to what
extent to adopt, vary or reject a referee's report are
set out in <i>Super Pty
Limited v S J P Constructions Australia Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2029%20NSWLR%20549" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 29 NSWLR 549.</a>
<P>

66	The Court's discretion to adopt, vary or reject a referee's report is not
constrained in the same way that challenges to arbitral
awards are constrained.
As <i>Super</i> makes plain, grounds for rejecting a report may include an
error of principle, a patent misapprehension of the evidence or perversity
or
manifest unreasonableness in fact finding.
<P>

67	Gleeson CJ with whom Mahoney and Clarke JA agreed, considered at 563 to 564,
that it was undesirable to attempt to constrain
the exercise of the Court's
discretion in respect of a referee's report.  Gleeson CJ made plain that a
court will not ordinarily
interfere with any findings of fact by a referee
where the referee has based his or her finding upon a choice as to which
evidence
is to be accepted.  In this respect Gleeson CJ agreed with the
following observations:
<P>

	<i>"As a broad proposition, depending upon the circumstances of each case, the
Court will not reconsider disputed questions of fact where
there is factual
material sufficient to entitle the referee to reach the conclusions he did,
particularly where the disputed questions
are in a technical area where the
referee enjoys an appropriate expertise.  [SPJ Formwork Aust Pty Limited v Leda
Constructions Pty
Limited (unreported Supreme Court of New South Wales 19 May
1992 Giles J)].</i>
<P>

68	Giles J had continued by citing Cole J in <i>White Constructions (NT) Pty
Limited  v  Commonwealth of Australia</i><b> </b>(1997) BCL 193:  
<P>

	<i>`In circumstances where the Court, having closely scrutinised the referee's
report, has a comfortable feeling of satisfaction that
the factual issues have
been properly explored and considered, in my view the Court should adopt the
referee's report on findings
of fact.'</i>
<P>

<i>	</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=29%20NSWLR%20549" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[29 NSWLR 549</a> at 553 to 554]
<P>

69	In <i>Super, </i>Mahoney JA continued at p 567, where his Honour held that
the Court in exercising its discretion with respect to the referee's report,
is
entitled to take into account the nature of the issue, the circumstances of the
case and the "extent to which the parties' case
has been presented to and dealt
with by the referee".  At 567 Mahoney JA said inter alia:
<P>

	<i>"The extent to which for example matters dealt with in detail before the
referee should be permitted to be dealt with at length before
the judge is to
be determined by the exercise of a discretionary judgment by the
judge</i><cite>.  The right to be heard does not involve the right to be heard
twice</cite><i>."  </i>[Emphasis added]
<P>

70	In <i>Foxman Holdings Pty Limited v NMBE Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2038%20NSWLR%20615" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 38 NSWLR
615</a>, Cole J in referring to <i>Super</i> stated:
<P>

	<i>"By `patent misapprehension of the evidence' I understand the Chief Justice
to be referring to a lack of understanding of the evidence
as distinct from the
according to particular aspects of the evidence different weights.  The
reference to "perversity or manifest
unreasonableness in fact finding" I
understand to relate to the exceptional case where it can be clearly
demonstrated that no reasonable
tribunal could have reached the decision
achieved.  It is true that may involve a consideration of the evidence.
However it is dealing
with a state of evidence regarding material facts
different to and more unreliable than a state of evidence said to be "unsafe
and
unsatisfactory to support such findings of fact".  It was not said here
that there was no material upon which the referee could have
made the findings
of fact which he made".</i>
<P>

71	Applying those principles to the exercise of the discretion presently
required in relation to the notices of motion before the
Court, I have no doubt
but that the proper exercise of the discretion is to adopt the whole of the
subject referee's report and to
do so in full.  To my mind it is particularly
important to take into account the fact that the issues of fact were referred
to the
referee as a structural engineer by reason of the complexity of the
technical matters to be taken into account and considered.  One
only needs to
glance through the report to appreciate the necessity for a referee, himself
trained in a relevant discipline, to be
able to (a) understand, and (b) apply,
those principles germane to determining the question of the causes of the
collapse of the
bridge on 6 January 1989.
<P>

72	It is impossible for the Court on an application for approval in whole or in
part of a report, to treat with a situation which
arises when there is tendered
a small section only of a transcript dealing with a complex issue involving one
of a large number of
variables that can be apparently input into a calculation
from which one can achieve a number of results.  The Court cannot determine
on
that material alone, that the report is one which exposes manifest error, or
otherwise within the ambit of the Court's plain discretion,
is such as to
require a description of a patent misapprehension of the evidence of perversity
or manifest unreasonableness in fact
finding.
<P>

73	Where an application is made for the adoption in whole or in part of a
report and a party seeks to have the whole of the report
rejected, on bases not
apparent from the face of the report but which require the Court to investigate
at whatever appropriate level
the material upon which the referee determined
and reported, it is necessary very often for detailed evidence to be placed
before
the Court as to the events which took place before the referee.  There
is no short cut it seems to me, and in the circumstances of
the current notice
of motion, to my mind none of the plaintiff's submissions, have been made good.
 The plaintiff's first bracket
of submissions amounted to a claim that if the
report be<u> </u>adopted in its entirety it was appropriate for the claims and
cross-claims to be dismissed.  I am disposed to adopt the whole of the
report
for the reasons given above.  That is not to say that the adoption of the
report results or results necessarily in the dismissal
by the Court of the
claims and cross-claims.  I return to this topic below.
<P>

74	The second bracket of the plaintiff's submissions to which I have referred,
would result in a rejection of these whole of the
report.  For reasons already
set out, those submissions are not accepted.  The third bracket of the
plaintiff's submissions advanced
in the written submissions were that the only
section of the report which should be adopted were Pt 5 of the report.  Here
again
the plaintiffs have not made good that bracket of submissions.
<P>

75	The position which obtained when the hearing commenced was that the notices
of motion to which I have referred sought the adoption,
save for the passage on
p 5 of the report commencing with the words "reports made from time to time"
through to the words "under
controlled conditions".  In submissions in reply Mr
Graves of Senior Counsel made plain as I understood it, that the defendants did
not ultimately press for the excision from the report to be adopted of those
words, following the submissions by Mr Rudge.  In those
circumstances I do not
understand that the defendant presses for reasons for judgment in relation to
why the defendants' notice of
motion order one is not to be made in those
terms, but the whole of the report is to be adopted.
<P>

76	It is finally necessary to deal with a matter which Mr Graves sought to
reserve his position in relation to.  In submissions
Mr Graves, at the same
time as indicating that the defendants did not wish to address any submissions
in relation to the adoption
by the Court of the whole of the report, sought to
submit that it was to be made clear that the defendants saw the adoption of the
whole of the report as giving some support to the defendants' submission that
the defendants would ultimately succeed on liability.
 In some debate with Mr
Graves the Court indicated that it was entirely inappropriate for the Court in
this judgment to in any fashion
treat with the use, if any, which either the
defendants or the plaintiff might seek to make in the ongoing proceedings of
sections
of the report or of the section of the report in s 5 to which so much
attention had been given.
<P>

77	In the result to my mind the way forward is for the Court simply to make
plain, as I do, that the adoption of the whole of the
report is to be regarded
as totally without prejudice to the entitlement of any party in the proceedings
to date to use in the further
hearing of the proceedings, before whichever
judge or judicial officer or referee the proceedings may be referred, the
report in
whatever fashion such party is advised.  I do not see it as the
Court's role today to categorise any portion of the referee's report
as
assisting, not assisting or as being neutral as it were, with respect to the
respective contentions of the parties to the respective
proceedings as to
liability or no liability.  In those circumstances it seems to me to be
inappropriate to do more than to note that
the adoption of the report is
without prejudice to the rights of any party in the future conduct of these
proceedings to rely as
they are advised or seek to submit upon sections of the
report in support of their case or cases, or in opposition to case/cases
brought against their respective clients.
<P>

78	In those circumstances the Court directs that the defendants bring in short
minutes of order at an appropriate time to reflect
the adoption of the report
in whole.
<P>

79	I reserve costs generally on the notices of motion for the time being.
