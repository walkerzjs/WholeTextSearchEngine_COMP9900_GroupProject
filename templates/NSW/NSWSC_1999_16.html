<b>1238 of 1998	TONY TRPEZANOVSKI &amp; ANOR  -v-</b>
<P>

<b>			JCA CONFECTIONERY PTY LIMITED &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b> By summons filed on 25 November 1998 the defendants JCA
Confectionery Pty Ltd, Menka Tiricovski, Robert Tiricovski and Slavica
Tiricovski
seek, substantively, an order that the notice to produce served upon
them by the plaintiffs and dated 14 October 1998  be set aside.
 That notice to
produce requires the defendants to produce for inspection by the plaintiffs,
Tony Trpezanovski and Anica Trpezanovski,
the following documents: 
<P>

	1.  	Cash book of the first defendant from the date of its 	incorporation to
the present.
<P>

	2.	All cheque butts, deposit books and bank statements 	of the first defendant
from the date of its 	incorporation to the present.
<P>

	3.	All contracts with customers and invoices of the first 	defendant from the
date of its incorporation to the 	present.
<P>

2	The substantive proceedings were instituted by summons filed by the
plaintiffs on 29 January 1998.  Those proceedings may compendiously
be
described as being in the nature of an oppression suit brought by the
plaintiffs against the defendants.  The plaintiffs were
substantial
shareholders in the first defendant.  It is contended by the plaintiffs that as
a result of further shares in the first
defendant being issued at the instance
of the second, third, fourth and fifth defendants, the shareholding of the
plaintiffs in the
first defendant has been considerably diluted and that the
affairs of the first defendant have been conducted by the other defendants
in a
way which is oppressive to the interests of the plaintiffs.
<P>

3	Amongst the items of substantive relief sought by the plaintiffs in the
summons is a prayer, in the alternative, for an order
that the second, third,
fourth and fifth defendants purchase the shares of the plaintiff in the first
defendant.  
<P>

4	The defendants resist the application by the plaintiffs for the production of
the documents required in the notice to produce
and seek that that notice be
set aside upon the ground that for the defendants to be required to produce
those items would be oppressive.
 The reasons why the production of those items
would be oppressive upon the defendants is set forth in paragraph 2 of the
affidavit
of Robert Tiricovski, the fourth defendant, sworn on 23 November
1998.  One of the reasons is that the plaintiffs are now in the
character of
trade rivals to the defendants in carrying on the business of the production of
licorice, which is the main business
of the first defendant.  Another reason
for which it is submitted that compliance with the notice to produce would be
oppressive
relates to the collation of the documents and to the cost to the
defendants of that collation.
<P>

5	I have been taken to two decided cases relevant to the production of
confidential documents to a commercial competitor.  The first
is the decision
of the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria in <i>Mobil Oil
Australia Limited v Guina Developments Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1996/54.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] VicRp 54</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%202%20VR%2034" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 2 VR 34.</a>  The leading
judgment was that of Hayne J (with whom the President and Phillips J agreed).
His Honour said, at 38, concerning an
application for discovery:
<P>

	While it may readily be accepted that a party is ordinarily entitled to
discovery and inspection of all discoverable documents
in the possession or
control of the opposite party (save those for which a valid claim for privilege
from production is claimed)
it is important to bear steadily in mind that
discovery is but a tool only to be used in the pursuit of justice and that the
rights
to discovery and inspection is not without its limits.
<P>

6	His Honour later continued:
<P>

	Where it is said that the documents are confidential, it may be accepted that
the fact that the documents are confidential will
not ordinarily be a
sufficient reason to deny inspection by the opposite party.  In most cases, the
fact that the documents may not
be used except for the purpose of the
litigation concerned will be a sufficient protection to the party producing
them. But where,
as here, the party obtaining discovery is a trade rival of the
person whose secrets it is proposed should be revealed by discovery
and
inspection, other considerations arise.
<P>

7	His Honour then referred to relevant considerations in the case of material
being revealed to a trade rival.  
<P>

8	The other decided case to which I have been referred was the decision of
McLelland CJ in Eq in <i>Telstra Corporation v Australis Media Holdings</i> (6
December 1996, unreported).  His Honour said:
<P>

	The general principle is that the compulsive processes of discovery should not
be permitted to invade the privacy and confidentiality
of a litigant's affairs
except to the extent that the interests of justice requires such a course in
the circumstances of the particular
case.  The relevant circumstances will vary
from case to case and a variety of different methods have been adopted in the
reported
decisions for the purpose of avoiding injustice - see particularly the
discussion in <i>Mobil Oil Australia v Guina Developments </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2033%20IR%2082" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 33 IRR 82</a>
and <i>Warner Lambert &amp; Co v Glaxo Laboratories</i><b> </b>(1975)<b>
</b>RPC 354.
<P>

9	His Honour then quoted the passage which I have earlier set forth from the
judgment of Hayne J in the <i>Mobil Oil Australia </i>case.  
<P>

10	It seems to me that the circumstance of trade rivals, which has been
considered not only by the Court of Appeal of the Supreme
Court of Victoria but
also by McLelland CJ in Eq, is one which is not directly applicable to the
facts of the present application.
 Here the proceedings are brought by the
plaintiffs not in their capacity as trade rivals of the defendant, but in their
capacity,
allegedly, as oppressed minority shareholders of the first defendant
who have suffered that oppression at the hands of the second,
third, fourth and
fifth defendants.  It is only since the alleged conduct of those defendants
constituting the oppression has taken
place that the plaintiffs have found
themselves in the position of commercial rivalry with the defendants.  It must
also be borne
in mind that the plaintiffs have made an offer of confidentiality
concerning any material that might be revealed to them.
<P>

11	The plaintiffs submit that they require the material referred to in the
notice to produce for two reasons. Firstly, to enable
an expert to conduct a
valuation of the shareholding in the first defendant. That valuation will be of
relevance if the plaintiffs
are successful in their oppression suit and if the
Court reaches a position where it requires the second, third, fourth and fifth
defendants to purchase the shares of the plaintiff in the first defendant.  In
that regard it should be noted that the suit has already
been set down for
hearing and that the plaintiffs at the hearing propose to request the trial
judge himself to arrive at a valuation
of the shareholding in the first
defendant rather than have that question of valuation referred for
determination by a Master.  
<P>

12	Secondly, the plaintiffs submit that the material is necessary for the
purposes of establishing the substantive entitlement of
the plaintiffs to
relief; that is, for establishing that there has been conduct on the part of
the second, third, fourth and fifth
defendants which constitutes oppression
against the plaintiffs in the carrying on of the conduct of the first
defendant.
<P>

13	It seems that for each of these reasons that the plaintiffs are prima facie
entitled to have the material referred to in the
notice to produce made
available to them.  It is only if the interests of justice for some reason
would require that the material
be withheld that the Court should not allow the
plaintiffs to have access to that material.  	During the course of
correspondence
between the solicitors the plaintiffs on 16 March 1998 (that is,
the best part of a year ago) put the defendants on notice that they
would be
requiring to have material produced and that they would be requiring to have a
valuation of the shareholding in the first
defendant performed as one of the
matters in issue in the proceedings.  Further, on 25 August 1998 the solicitor
for the defendants
in a letter of that date said that he had been instructed
that the cheque books, deposit books, bank statements and cash books to
the
extent existing in relation to the balance sheets provided would be available
for inspection.  At that stage there appeared to
be no problem concerning the
documents being made available to the plaintiffs.
<P>

14	It seems to me that in the interests of justice the plaintiffs are entitled
to have the notice to produce complied with, subject
to the appropriate
undertaking as to confidentiality.  It follows therefore that I do not propose
to set aside that notice, as the
defendants now request.  I propose therefore
to dismiss the defendants' notice of motion.
<P>

15	I make the following orders:
<P>

	1.	I order that the notice of motion filed by the 	defendants on 25 November
1998 be dismissed.
<P>

	2.	I order that the defendants pay the costs of the 	plaintiffs of the
aforesaid notice of motion.
<P>

	3.	I grant leave to the plaintiffs to proceed forthwith to 	assessment of the
foregoing costs.
<P>

	4.	I reserve liberty to the parties to apply on seven 	days' notice in respect
to the form of the 	undertaking as to confidentiality.
<P>
