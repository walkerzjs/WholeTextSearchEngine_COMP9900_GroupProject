<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Quash orders of Consumer Claims Tribunals;)</b>
<P>

<b>				  denial of natural justice)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By amended summons filed 13 August 1999 the
plaintiff seeks firstly, a declaration that a Referee of the Consumer Claims
Tribunal,
in making an order under s 30(a) of the <b>Consumer Claims Tribunals
Act </b>(NSW) 1987 (as amended), denied the appellant natural justice in
respect to two (2) items of his determination dated 21 June 1999;
 secondly, an
order that the two (2) items under appeal be referred to an independent
arbitrator for hearing, determination and final
award;   and thirdly, that
costs of the appeal by way of an order under the <b>Suitor's Fund Act</b> (NSW)
1951 (as amended).  The plaintiff relied on his affidavit sworn 12 July 1999.
The defendant filed a submitting appearance.
 Mr Sergio appeared at the hearing
but took no active role aside from giving evidence on one issue.
<P>

2  	Mr Gabriel Michel Alagha the appellant in these proceedings is a
builder, and a civil and structural engineer.  He was the respondent
in a claim
before the Consumer Claims Tribunals.  The proprietors of the premises Jose and
Marta Sergio were the claimants.  They
claimed for loss of interest due to
delay in completing work which was the subject of a contract between the
parties.  They also
claimed for costs of repair of defects allegedly due to
poor construction.  
<P>

3  	The appellant submitted that he had been denied natural justice
in relation to two (2) items which appear in the Referee's published
reasons of
21 June 1999.  They are those which appear under the headings "defective
concrete work and footing system".
<P>

4  	In relation to defective concrete work the Referee stated:
<P>

<b>"The Claimant maintains that a substantial area of the concrete paving is
defective to the extent that it will have to be replaced
for a quoted price of
$5,000.00 (Ex 24).  In support of the Claim there were presented both photos
and an expert report from Mr Peter
Martin (Ex 7).</b>
<P>

<b>The Respondent acknowledged a problem with a small area of the concrete but
stated that the quoted cost to repair was excessive.</b>
<P>

<b>I prefer the evidence of the Claimant as supported by their expert.  In my
view the concrete is proved to be defective and the reasonable
cost of the
necessary repairs is $5,000.00.  This amount is transferred to the
summary."</b>
<P>

5  	In relation to the footing system the Referee stated:
<P>

<b>"There was insufficient evidence presented by the Respondent to persuade me
that in the circumstances he is entitled to any of the
monies claimed.  The
Claimant denied that there had been any discussion in respect of having to pay
extra and, in any case, on the
evidence presented by the Claimant I am not
persuaded that the Claimant received any extra benefit from the Respondent over
and above
what the Respondent was liable to provide under the terms of the
original contract."</b>
<P>

<b><u>The Law</u></b>
<P>

6  	On 1 March 1999 the <b>Consumer Claims Tribunals Act</b> 1987 was
repealed by the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1998172/" class="autolink_findacts">Consumer Claims Act</a></b> 1998.  The <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1998172/" class="autolink_findacts">Consumer Claims
Act</a></b> 1998 commenced on 1 March 1999.  By virtue of Schedule 1 to the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1998172/" class="autolink_findacts">Consumer Claims Act</a></b> 1998, the <b>Consumer Claims Tribunals Act</b> 1987
applied to matters that had not been finally determined by the Consumer Claims
Tribunal.  These proceedings fall under the 1987
Act.
<P>

7  	The plaintiff relied on s 12(2)(b)(ii) of the <b>Consumer Claims
Tribunals Act</b> 1987 which gives this court the jurisdiction to grant relief
in relation to the hearing or determination of the claim if a party
has been
denied natural justice.  No appeal lies to this court where errors of fact or
law have occurred.  
<P>

8  	At the outset, it is helpful to set out some of the provisions of
the<b> Act</b>.  The Tribunal is not constrained by the rigour of the court
room.  In a sense, its function is to mete out rough justice or at least
a less
than perfect form of justice in an economical way appropriate for disputes
within the limits of its jurisdiction.  Evidence
before the Tribunal must be
relevant to the determination of a claim (s 23(1) of the Act and must be given
on oath or statutory declaration
(s 23(2) - s 23(3)) but the Tribunal is not
bound by the rules or practice of evidence and the Tribunal may inform itself
on any
matter in such manner as it considers appropriate (s 23(4) - see also s
29(4)).  I shall return to discuss s 23 in more detail later
in this judgment.
The Tribunal must conform to the rules of natural justice but, broadly
speaking, has control of and responsibility
for its own procedures (s 17(1)).
Its business is conducted in private (s 22(1)).  There is no requirement that
Referees constituting
the Tribunal be legally qualified.  The orders of the
Tribunal must, in its opinion, be "fair and equitable" (s 31(1)).  The tribunal
has no power to award costs (s 28).  Pursuant to s 29 of the <b>Act</b> the
Tribunal is obliged to use its best endeavours to bring the parties to a
settlement before making any order.
<P>

9  	In <b><u>Hutley v Meigan &amp; Ors</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20ASC%2065%2d370" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) ASC 65-370</a>,
Rolfe J referred to the often quoted and, if I may respectfully say so, the
helpful comments of Hunt J (as he then was) in <b><u>Singer v Statutory and
Other Officers Remuneration Tribunal</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20633" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 633</a> and those of
Simpson J in <b><u>Archcom Pty Limited v Consumer Claims Tribunal &amp;
Ors</u></b> (NSWSC, 29 September 1995, unreported) which deal with the nature
of the proceedings in the Consumer Claims Tribunal.  
<P>

10  	The Tribunal has been established to deal with small claims in a
relatively informal and expeditious manner.  As Hunt J said
in
<b><u>Singer</u></b> at p 635:
<P>

<b>"The Consumer Tribunal Act 1974 has set up a system for the speedy and
inexpensive disposal of certain claims, limited in amount,
arising out of
contracts for the supply of goods or the provision of services by a person
carrying on (or holding himself out as
carrying on) the business of supplying
such goods or providing such services.  The tribunal hearing such claims is
constituted by
a referee, who need not have (and who in many cases does not
have) legal qualification."</b>
<P>

<u>11  	</u>As Simpson J said in <b><u>Archcom</u></b> at p 12 after
referring to the remarks of Hunt J:
<P>

<b>"Those remarks were made in the context of the predecessor of the Act, a
1974 Act by the same title, but they apply equally to the
Act.  Underpinning
the Act is a policy of providing expeditious access to an inexpensive and
informal process for the resolution
of consumer disputes involving relatively
small amounts of money.  Speed and economy are to be accompanied and (it is
hoped) often
achieved, by informality."</b>
<P>

12  	Her Honour continued, at pp 13-14:
<P>

<b>"The intention of the legislature, in creating these tribunals as a forum
for the resolution of disputes involving relatively small
amounts of money was
the achievement of expeditious and inexpensive justice between the parties
while maintaining a proper regard
for, and protection of, the rights of the
parties to the dispute.  The difficulty, as I see it, lies in striking the
correct balance
between those two goals.  Speedy and inexpensive solutions may
be inimicable to the protection of rights.  There is no necessary
relationship
between the factual or legal complexity and the quantum of a claim but legal
rights and obligations remain at the heart
of the tribunal's jurisdiction.
Although a tribunal is enjoined to make such orders as will, in its opinion, be
fair and equitable
to all parties to the claim (s 31(1)), those orders must be
grounded in legal liability."</b>
<P>

13  	Her Honour thus stressed the need for "justice" and the
"protection of rights".
<P>

14  	In relation to natural justice, Professor S A de Smith,
<b>Judicial Review of Administrative Act</b>, 2nd ed., pp 180-181 has stated:

<P>

<b>"Natural justice generally required that persons liable to be directly
affected by proposed administrative acts, decisions or proceedings
be given
adequate notice of what is proposed, so that they may be in a position:  (a) to
make representations on their own behalf;
 or (b) to appear at a hearing or
inquiry (if one is to be held);  and (c) effectively to prepare their own case
and to answer the
case (if any) they have to meet."</b>
<P>

15  	In <b><u>Kioa v West</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/81.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 81</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20159%20CLR%20550" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 159 CLR 550</a> the High Court
held that the duty to accord natural justice is a duty to act fairly.  In the
normal course, a party to judicial proceedings
(as are those in a tribunal)
could expect to be apprised of the nature of the case sought to be made against
it, and of the date
and time fixed for hearing such as to give it a reasonable
opportunity to meet that case and to advance its own.  These statements
are
similar to those expressed by Professor de Smith and referred to earlier.
Brennan J (as he then was) at p 628 stated:
<P>

<b>"A person whose interests are likely to be affected by an exercise of power
must be given an opportunity to deal with relevant matters
adverse to his
interest which the repository of the power proposes to take into account in
deciding upon its exercise."</b>
<P>

16  	In relation to procedural fairness, Mason J stated in
<b><u>Kioa</u></b> that the law had now developed to a point where it may be
accepted that there is a common law duty to act fairly, in the sense of
according procedural fairness, in the making of administrative decisions which
affect the rights, interests and legitimate expectations,
subject only to the
clear manifestation of a contrary statutory intention.  Procedural fairness is
a notion of a flexible obligation
to adopt fair procedures which are
appropriate and adapted to the circumstances of the particular case (pp 454 and
455).
<P>

17  	In relation to the defective concrete work, the appellant
complained that he had never seen an experts report of Mr Peter Martin
nor a
quote from Arinaldo's Concreting dated 13 May 1999 in the sum of $5,000.  The
appellant has sworn an affidavit to that effect.
 However, his version of not
being supplied with Mr Martin's report is at odds with the account given by the
Referee and Mr Sergio.
 The Referee's notes of 18 November 1998 at p 4 refer to
the expert's report (Ex 7 in those proceedings) and stated that Mr Alagha
was
given a copy of it (Ex B in these proceedings).  In the Referee's notes of 24
March 1999 (Ex C in these proceedings) there is
a statement that he reminded
the parties that they had access to all of the bundle of documents.  There are
references in the Referee's
notes concerning the appellant's behaviour before
the tribunal which show that it was less than exemplary.  Mr Sergio gave
evidence
that when he received Mr Martin's report he spoke to the appellant by
telephone.  The appellant asked Mr Sergio to fax a copy of
the report.  Mr
Sergio said he faxed a copy of Mr Martin's report to the appellant within a few
days.  I prefer the evidence of Mr
Sergio and the Referee.  I find that the
appellant did receive the experts report well before the hearing in March 1999.
The appellant
submitted that the quote should have been in the form of an
affidavit.  Section 23 of the Act provides:
<P>

<b>"Taking of evidence</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	At the hearing of a consumer claim, evidence relevant to the
determination of the claim may be given orally or in writing.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	If evidence at the hearing of a consumer claim is to be given orally, it
must be given on oath.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	If evidence at the hearing of a consumer claim is to be given in
writing, it must be given either on oath or by statutory declaration,
as the
giver of evidence prefers.</b>
<P>

<b>(4)	A tribunal is not bound by the rules or practice of evidence and,
subject to subsections (2) and (3), can inform itself on any
matter in such
manner as it considers appropriate."</b>
<P>

18  	It would also seem that the appellant had ample opportunity to
inspect the quote and raise any objection he had in relation
to it being
admitted into evidence.  The appellant submitted that the quote should have
been in the form of a statutory declaration
in accordance with s 23(3).  The
appellant was given an adjournment for a short period on 23 March 1999.  If he
had any difficulty
meeting the quote he could have sought a further
adjournment.
<P>

19  	I he had any concerns he could have raised them at hearing.
There is no evidence that he did so.  He did however take the opportunity
to
submit to the Referee, that the quote to repair was excessive.  I do not think
that either of these complaints give rise to a
denial of natural justice.
<P>

20  	The last complaint in relation to the defective concrete work
was that the Referee preferred the evidence of Mr Martin the
claimant's expert,
rather than that of the respondent (appellant in these proceedings).  It was
open to the Referee to prefer one
view over the other.  There was no error of
law or fact.  Even if there had been an error of law or fact it is not
reviewable by
this court - see s 12(2)(b)(ii) of the Act.  The appellant
appeared at the tribunal and was able to effectively prepare his own case
and
answer the case he had to meet and was given an opportunity to make
representations on his behalf.  There was no denial of natural
justice.
<P>

21  	In relation to the appellant's complaint concerning the
Referee's findings on the footing system, they amount to assertions
that the
Referee made an error of fact or law.  There is no denial of the rules of
natural justice.  The appellant has been unsuccessful.
 The decision of the
Referee of 21 June 1999 is affirmed.  The amended summons is dismissed.  The
appellant is to pay the second
defendants' costs.
<P>

22  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The decision of the Referee of 21 June 1999 is affirmed.
<P>

(2)	The amended summons filed 13 August 1999 is dismissed.
<P>

(3)	The appellant is to pay the second defendants' costs.
