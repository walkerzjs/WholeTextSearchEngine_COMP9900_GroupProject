<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT   (Re Costs)</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:		</b>In this matter I gave my decision dismissing the appeal
yesterday.  I ordered the plaintiff to pay the first defendant's costs.  Mr
Quickenden for the Minister for Fair Trading ("the intervener") then sought an
order for costs in favour of the intervener as and
against the plaintiff
appellant.  The matter was adjourned overnight in order for the parties to give
consideration to the application
made by Mr Quickenden.
<P>

2	This morning I have heard oral argument from both Mr Marshall and Mr
Quickenden.  Mr Marshall opposes an order for costs in favour
of the
intervener.  Mr Quickenden submits that I should make some order.
<P>

3	Section 86 of the  <b><u>Fair Trading Act</u></b>  confers a right upon the
Minister for Fair Trading to intervene in these proceedings.  Upon intervening,
the Minister becomes a
party to the proceedings possessing all the rights
including rights of appeal of a party to the proceedings.  There is nothing to
suggest that such rights do not include rights in relation to costs.  Indeed,
it has not been submitted that the rights do not include
an intervener's right
in relation to costs.
<P>

4	Section 76 of the  <b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a> (NSW)</u></b>  provides, that
subject to the Act and Rules and subject to any other Act, that costs shall be
the discretion of the court and that
the court shall have full power to
determine by whom and to what extent costs are to be paid.  That section
confers a discretion
as to costs.  That discretion must, of course, be
exercised judicially.  So much is accepted by both the plaintiff and the
intervener
in the present case.
<P>

5	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p52" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52</a> Rule 4 provides that the powers and discretions under s 76 of the Act
shall be exercised subject to and in accordance with that part.
 It has been
accepted by the parties that pursuant to s 76 and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p52" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52</a> that an order for
costs can, in fact, even be made in certain circumstances or, indeed, in the
appropriate circumstances, against
an intervener who intervenes pursuant to s
86 of the  <b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a> (NSW)</u></b>.  That said, it is
accepted by the parties that the court has a judicial discretion to make an
order for costs in favour of an intervener
who under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 86</a>, becomes a party to
the proceedings.
<P>

6	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p52" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 11</a> provides that if the court makes an order for costs, the
court shall, subject to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p52" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52</a>, order that costs follow the event except where
it appears to the court that some other order should be made as to the whole or
any
part of the costs.
<P>

7	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 76</a>, as I have said, confers a discretion and a full discretionary
power righting to the matter of costs which is further recognised
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p52" class="autolink_findacts">Part
52.</a>
<P>

8	The dispute appears to be, therefore, one relating to how I should exercise
the discretion that I have, and which it is conceded
that I have, in respect of
this particular matter.  Mr Marshall has submitted that in the circumstances I
should make no order for
costs, in respect of the matter of intervention or in
favour of the intervener.
<P>

9	As I have said, it is common ground, as I understand it, that the costs
principles are derived from <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s76.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 76</a> and the Rules.  I have been taken to a number
of authorities and particularly authorities which deal with the position of
costs of
an intervener where there has been intervention pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s78.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 78</a> A(2)
of the  <b><u>Judiciary Act</u></b>.  That provision is not, however, a
parallel provision to the provisions of the type that I am presently
considering in this case.
Further, it is a provision which permits of the
court, in circumstances where it applies, to make, in effect, a one-sided order
for
costs as and against the Commonwealth or State who intervenes in
proceedings where s 78 A(2) applies. (See<b>  <u>O'Toole  v  Charles David Pty
Ltd</u></b>  (1990), 171 CLR 232 at pages 310 to 311.)
<P>

10	The matter of intervention and amicus curiae was considered by the High
Court in<b>  <u>Levy  v  State of Victoria</u>  </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/31.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 31</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20189%20CLR%20579" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 189 CLR 579.</a>  In
that case there were a number of applications by parties to intervene or to
appear as amicus curiae.  At p 650, Kirby J observed,
for good reason, the
court should maintain a tight rein on interventions and where such
interventions were permitted the court should
impose terms which protect the
parties from costs and or burdens which interventions may occasion.  Of course,
the situation in <b><u>Levy</u></b>  is different to the instant one where
there was an intervention not pursuant to leave, but in a situation where there
was an intervention
as of the right by the Minister pursuant to s 86 of the
<b><u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a></u></b>.  The plaintiff and the first defendant both or
either were not in a position nor had a right to oppose such intervention being
and
one of right conferred by statute.
<P>

11	Nevertheless, I would consider it appropriate to repeat what was said in a
different context in<b>  <u>Levy's</u></b> case  by Kirby J, particularly at p
651.  His Honour said:
<P>

	"The court itself retains full control over its procedures.  It will always
protect and respect the primacy of the parties.  Costs
and other inhibiting
risks will, almost always, discourage officious busybodies. Those who persist
can usually be recognised and
easily rebuffed".
<P>

12	It has not been suggested in the instant matter that the intervention by the
Minister was the intervention by a busy body nor
has it been suggested such
intervention could have been rebuffed by either the plaintiff or the first
defendant, as the case may
be.  Nevertheless, I consider the point that Kirby J
makes is of some relevance in the instant case.  The court should respect the
primacy of the parties.  The court should respect that this litigation, which
has come  on appeal, was a private litigation between
two private litigants.
Neither of them in the circumstances invited the intervention either before the
Residential Tenancies Tribunal
or, indeed, in this Court.  The intervention was
rather imposed upon them.
<P>

13	Mr Quickenden in his very helpful submission has argued that it was not
suggested that the intervention had been inappropriate.
 That is true.
Nevertheless, it could not have been legally argued that intervention could or
should have been barred by the court.
<P>

14	Next, Mr Quickenden argued that had the plaintiff been successful in the
appeal, that it was probable that the first defendant
and intervener, both or
either, would have been ordered to pay the plaintiff's costs.  However, that
argument is somewhat hypothetical
and speculative.  The simple fact is that the
plaintiff was not successful and, hence, one does not have to consider what
might well
have been the situation had the decision been otherwise.
<P>

15	Mr Quickenden argued that intervention here was, indeed, warranted, first of
all, by virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s86.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 86</a>, the intervener became a party and, secondly, because of
the matter of merit, that needed to be considered in the matter.  He argued
that the construction of the Act urged by the plaintiff would have diminished
the role of the Residential Tenancies Tribunal.
<P>

16	I have had regard to these submissions.  As I would understand this case,
during the substantive appeal, as regards the matter
of result, or what was
urged to be the appropriate result, the Minister supported the position of the
first defendant, namely, that
the Tribunal's decision was right and that the
appeal should be dismissed.
<P>

17	The Minister also supported and identified one of the constructions or the
interpretations of the legislative provision, that
had been urged by the first
defendant.  To the extent that such construction found favour with me, there
was a degree of duplication
and overlapping in relation to the argument
advanced, in respect of that particular matter.  Strangely enough, in respect
of a matter
that was urged by the plaintiff, namely, that relating to the
court's jurisdiction, the Minister identified himself with the plaintiff's
argument on that point.
<P>

18	The first defendant had submitted that in circumstances where the plaintiff
had consented to the Tribunal having jurisdiction
as it did in the instant
case, an argument was not available to the plaintiff, to the effect that
despite such conduct, on appeal,
this Court could find that there was, in fact,
no jurisdiction.  I indicated in my reasons yesterday that I considered such
argument
was at least unmeritorious in the circumstances of this case.
Nevertheless, the plaintiff contended that despite its consent in the
Tribunal
below, that, nevertheless, the jurisdictional point could still be validly
raised on appeal.
<P>

19	The Minister in a most helpful submission rather seemed to have adopted the
position that the plaintiff was right on that point.
 So, to that extent, there
was some degree of overlapping and duplication, in respect of argument, which
has been referred to as
the jurisdictional argument, or alternatively, an
argument, by both defendants.
<P>

20	For these extempore reasons, in respect of a somewhat interesting costs
question, I believe that in the circumstances of this
case and in the exercise
of my discretion, that I should make no order for costs in the dispute between
the plaintiff and the intervener.
 In the exercise of my discretion I decline
to make an order that the plaintiff pay the intervener's costs.
