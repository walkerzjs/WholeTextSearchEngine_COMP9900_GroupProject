<P>

<b>EQUITY DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>YOUNG, J</b>
<P>

<b>FRIDAY 21 MAY 1999</b>
<P>

<b>3978/98 - AUSTRALIAN SECURITY ESTATES PTY LTD V BLUECREST HOLDINGS PTY LTD
&amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :  </b> The parties are involved in lengthy proceedings in
which, to put it simply, the plaintiff was the proprietor and the first
defendant
the builder.   There are a series of associated proceedings.
<P>

2	It would appear that the contract involved the building of blocks of units on
several pieces of land.  The first defendant is
now in liquidation.  The second
defendant is the liquidator.  The first defendant says, though the plaintiff
does not agree, that
this is a result of the non payment to it by the
proprietor of moneys in connection with these building contracts.
<P>

3	There are two blocks of land, one at 176 Old South Head Road, Bellevue Hill
and the other at 1A Tara Street, Woollahra over which
the first defendant has
placed caveats. Lapsing notices issued in respect of those caveats but they
have been continued until further
order.
<P>

4	The plaintiff seeks an order that that continuation only be preserved on the
basis that the second defendant gives an undertaking
as to damages or that the
undertaking as to damages by the Company be appropriately secured.  The first
defendant does not wish to
give an undertaking as to damages for a variety of
reasons.  First it says that this is a special case in which an undertaking
should
not be required.  Secondly, it says that in the instant case it is
prepared and has made an open offer to give an undertaking progressively
to
release units for proper purposes so that no damages should be incurred.
Thirdly, that the plaintiff has never quantified any
of the losses which it has
evidently claimed and already began to run and fourthly, as the first defendant
is in liquidation, an
undertaking should not either be required of the
liquidator personally or in circumstances where the registered proprietor has
brought
about the liquidation, at least in part.
<P>

5	I was much assisted by the submissions made on the scheme of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/index.html#p7a" class="autolink_findacts">part 7A</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act 1900</a> dealing with caveats both by Mr Collins QC and Mr Pesman
on behalf of the plaintiff and Mr Haffenden on behalf of the defendants.
<P>

6	The cases are not completely reconcilable but various threads go through them
which allow some general propositions to be noted.
<P>

1. 	<b>Eng Mee Yong v Letchumanan</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20AC%20331" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] AC 331</a> is authority for the
proposition that a caveat is analogous to an interim injunction.
<P>

2.  	That analogy, as the cases show, must not be pressed too  far:  <b>Bethian
Pty Ltyd v Green </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1978/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] HCA 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%203%20Fam%20LR%2011" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 3 Fam LR 11</a>, 579;  <b>Kingstone Constructions Pty
Ltd v Crisfel Pty Ltd </b>(1991) 5 BPR 11,987, 11,991.  Although the
proposition means that a court needs to consider not only whether there is an
arguable
case but also whether the balance of convenience favours retention of
the caveat, (see eg <b>Vella v Aliperti</b> (1995) 7 BPR 14,657, 14,664) the
analogy is not complete.
<P>

3.  	Whilst in the case of an interlocutory injunction the rule is that apart
from exceptional cases there is no injunction unless
an undertaking as to
damages is proffered (<b>Southern Tableland</b> <b>Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd v
Schomberg</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2011%20ACLR%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 11 ACLR 337)</a>, the rule with caveats is not quite as
definite.
<P>

4.  	Although to a degree one proceeds on analogy with interlocutory
injunctions, the decision whether to extend a caveat at all
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74k.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 74K</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a>, and if it is extended on what conditions, is a matter
for the discretion of the Court and that discretion is not to be trammelled
by
too strict adherence to the principles applicable in the case of an
interlocutory injunction.
<P>

As has been pointed out on numerous occasions, the statutory words of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74k.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
74K</a> are that the Court is to consider if it is satisfied that the caveator's
claim has or may have substance.  Thus the Court can continue
the caveat at a
very early stage in the proceedings, if it can see that given a little time to
collect the evidence, the plaintiff
might be able to establish an arguable case
that it has an interest in land to protect.  The Court is not limited to
situations where
the plaintiff can prove its case at the date the application
is made:  <b>Jensen v Guigni </b>(1994) 6 BPR 13,667, 13,669.
<P>

5.  	Again it is discretionary as to whether the Court will take an undertaking
as to damages.  The authorities were collected and
discussed in <b>BP Oil New
Zealand Ltd v Van Beers Motors Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%201%20NZLR%20211" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 1 NZLR 211.</a>  Barker J referred to
all the recent New Zealand articles on the problem, approved the decision in
<b>Holmes</b> <b>v Australasian Holdings Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.nzlii.org/nz/cases/NZHC/1988/123.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] NZHC 123</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%202%20NZLR%20303" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 2 NZLR 303</a> and then
said at page 219 that there was a discretion in every case as to whether the
Court would ask for an undertaking as to damages
as a condition to extend a
caveat.
<P>

His Honour then said, "One would imagine that, in the vast bulk of cases,
including the present, there can be little argument but
that the discretion
should be exercised in favour of the registered proprietor."
<P>

7	That, to my mind, is the rule that this Court should generally apply.  I did
so in <b>Jean-Pierre Cosmetics Pty Ltd v Gary Truswell and Associates Pty Ltd
</b>(1994) 6 BPR 13, 497, and it is the rule that is set out in Lindsay,
<b>Caveats Against Dealings</b> (Federation Press, Sydney, 1995) at pages 213
to 214.  Although the English have not yet advanced to the Torrens system, it
is a
rule that their Court of Appeal has applied in analogous circumstances
with regard to cautions:  <b>Tucker v Hutchinson</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2054%20P%20%26%20CR%20106" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 54 P &amp; CR
106.</a>
<P>

8	Accordingly, one does not have to go quite so far as to find exceptional or
special circumstances as per the <b>Southern Tableland</b> <b>case</b> but one
does start with a bias towards making the caveator give an undertaking as to
damages.  Why then should that not occur in
this case?
<P>

9	Each case must depend on its own facts.  It seems to me in the instant case
that the combined facts show that:
<P>

(a) 	there is an arguable case that the liquidation was at least partly caused
by the underlying dispute between these parties;
<P>

(b) 	the plaintiff has not quantified or illustrated the type of damage that it
fears; and
<P>

(c) 	an undertaking has been proffered which would leap most practical problems
that might occur before the underlying dispute is
resolved such that the Court
should not insist on an undertaking as to damages at this time.
<P>

10	I would add that if I was of the view that an undertaking should be exacted,
I would agree that it should not, unless he were
willing to proffer it, come
from the liquidator personally, but rather should be secured by the appropriate
bank guarantee;  see
eg <b>Rosling &amp;</b> <b>Flynn Ltd v Law Guarantee and
Trust Co</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281903%29%2047%20Sol%20Jo%20255" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1903) 47 Sol Jo 255.</a>  As no sum has been particularised, my view
would have been only to require a secured undertaking as to $5,000 with liberty
to apply
to increase that amount if there was evidence of a very real
probability that the damages might be more than nominal.
<P>

11	This application has really come about because of the inadequacies of the
compensation provision in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74p.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 74P</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act</a>.  Those
deficiencies have been commented upon before by Judges.  It does not appear
that Parliament is going to do anything about
it.  Accordingly, as a general
rule, the Court needs ordinarily to seek such an undertaking as to damages, and
also in view of the
inadequacies of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74j.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 74J</a>,  needs to seek an undertaking
that the caveat will be removed if the Court should hold that it should not
remain, cf <b>McCosker v Lovett</b> (1995) 7 BPR 14,507.
<P>

12	Accordingly the application is dismissed with costs including reserved
costs.
<P>

13	I make the same order in suit 4639 of 1998.
<P>

                                            oOo
