<b>1481/99	DEVON MARSHALL CONSTRUCTIONS PTY LTD v KINGSCLIFF NOMINEE MORTGAGES
PTY LTD (In Liq)</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	Injunctive relief is sought by Devon Marshall Constructions Pty Ltd against
Jean Sayer, the second defendant in these proceedings.
 The plaintiff is a
builder which seeks to exercise a right of indemnity against trust funds in the
hands of the trustee of a mortgage.
 The circumstances are such that it has a
prima facie case for such a right of indemnity and has a case for interlocutory
relief
freezing the proceeds of the mortgage until the substantive questions
can be determined.  Objection to this course is taken on behalf
of the second
defendant, who is the receiver of a solicitor's practice, appointed as such by
an order made in the Common Law Division
of this Court under the provisions of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s92.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 92</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act 1987</a> ("the LPA").  There is no dispute between
the plaintiff and the second defendant that the mortgagee company was a
solicitor's nominee
company maintained by the solicitor within the meaning of
reg 57(1)(c) of the Legal Profession Regulation 1994.  That is a regulation
which limits the manner in which what are known as contributory mortgages may
be arranged by solicitors.
<P>

2	Miss Sayer's case is that property of such a nominee company is property of
the solicitor within the meaning of s 92(1) of the
LPA and consequently of the
order made in this case against the solicitor in the Common Law Division.  That
proposition is controverted
by Mr Simpkins, of counsel for the plaintiff.
Furthermore, s 112 of the LPA provides that the receivable property of a
solicitor
is not liable to be taken in execution of an order or process of any
court.  Mr Harrison, of senior counsel for the second defendant,
submits that
this renders any injunction pointless.  The injunction itself, he concedes, is
not within the terms of s 112 but the
only purpose of the injunction is, in
effect, to hold the funds so that they may ultimately be taken in some way
which must amount
to execution of an order or process within s 112, and the
injunction therefore ought not be granted.  Counsel are not able to cite
any
authority as to the meaning of the expression "property of a solicitor" within
the meaning of s 92(1) or as to the ambit of s
112 of the LPA.
<P>

3	I do not think that it is self-evident either that the proceeds of this
mortgage are "property of a solicitor" in the relevant
sense, nor that there
can be no point in an injunction being granted by reason of the existence of s
112.  There is no reason of
convenience that can be put before me as to why the
funds should not be frozen for a short time.  Their expenditure would, however,
be inconvenient from the plaintiff's point of view if the funds were, before
the substantive proceedings could be determined, disbursed
by the receiver and
ceased to be available, if it is found that the plaintiff has a subrogated
right over them.  In those circumstances,
the usual undertaking as to damages
being offered, I propose to grant injunctive relief.  At the request of Mr
Harrison I shall reserve
liberty to apply to discharge or vary the injunction
on three days notice.  It may be that the three defendants also have an
interest
in the subject matter but they are not present today.  I reserve a
similar liberty to them to exercise if they be so minded.  In
my view, and it
is not dissented from by either counsel for the plaintiff or for the second
defendant, the appropriate order for
costs is that the costs of this
interlocutory application be the plaintiff's costs in the proceedings. 
<P>

4	Upon the plaintiff by its counsel giving to the Court the usual undertaking
as to damages:
<P>

1	Order 7 in the summons until further order.
<P>

2	I reserve to the second defendant and the third defendant leave to apply to
discharge or vary the injunction on three days notice.
<P>

3	I order that the costs of the application for interlocutory injunction be the
plaintiff's costs in the proceedings.
<P>

4	I direct that the second defendant file and serve all affidavits on which she
intends to rely on or before 16 April 1999.
<P>

5	I stand the summons over to 19 April 1999 at 9.30 am before the Registrar.
