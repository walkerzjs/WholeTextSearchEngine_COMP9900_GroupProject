Wednesday 21 July 1999
<P>

97/023	<b>APPLICATION OF RAYMOND JOHN ROSEVEAR</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  This is an application pursuant to s 13A of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></i>.  The applicant, Raymond John Rosevear, seeks
determination of a minimum term and an additional term for an existing life
sentence
which I imposed upon him on 27 August 1990.
<P>

2  	The applicant is eligible to make the application having served
the period set by s 13A(3)(a) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></i>.
<P>

3  	Section 13A(4A) requires the Court in considering this
application 
<P>

<i>"to have regard to all the circumstances surrounding the offence for which
the life sentence was imposed, and all offences, wherever
committed, of which
[the applicant] has been convicted at any time."</i>
<P>

4  	Before considering the circumstances of the offence in respect of
which the life sentence was imposed, I observe that the only
other offences
recorded against the applicant were an offence of "assault police" in April
1966 for which a fine of $60 was imposed,
and an offence of "shop break and
steal" in September 1972 for which the applicant was placed on a recognizance
to be of good behaviour
for two years.
<P>

5  	The circumstances of the crime of murder committed by the
applicant were addressed in my remarks on sentence on 27 August 1990:
<P>

<i>"The Crown case was that on 19 October 1989 the [applicant] lit a fire in a
caravan in which he lived with his now deceased wife at
Rivergum Caravan Park,
Corowa.  A convincing case of circumstantial evidence established to my mind
beyond reasonable doubt the accused
lit this fire deliberately, having soaked
the bed clothes on the double bed inside the caravan with methylated
spirits.</i>
<P>

<i>The accused, when ultimately on the Crown case he confessed to having lit
the fire in an interview with investigating police officers,
said that he
grabbed his wife, probably by the throat, and pushed her on to the bed, then
lit the fire.  The post mortem findings
proved the presence of haematoma
consistent with attempted strangulation.  To my mind the evidence proved beyond
reasonable doubt
the [applicant] did grab his wife by the throat and I accept
beyond reasonable doubt that the [applicant] assaulted his wife immediately
prior to the fire.</i>
<P>

<i>The deceased survived for some three days after the fire and was treated in
hospital for burns to 65% of her body.  However, the evidence
of Dr Bradhurst
was that the deceased died from cardiac failure which was due to shock
consequent upon the burn injuries.</i>
<P>

<i>The [applicant] at the trial made a statement in which he said in effect
that he had no clear recollection as to what had happened.
 He said he had no
memory of what happened on that day.  He said that the record of interview was
`not off my own bat'.  He claimed
that words were put into his mouth by the
police officers but the jury appears to have rejected that assertion and I am
satisfied
beyond reasonable doubt the [applicant] said to the police when
interviewed on 15 January 1989 precisely what the police claimed
he
said.</i>
<P>

<i>Through his counsel the [applicant] did not admit at the trial that he lit
the fire or that he lit it deliberately but it is implicit
in the jury's
finding that the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the
[applicant] did light the fire deliberately.</i>
<P>

<i>The [applicant] raised a defence of diminished responsibility, relying upon
psychiatric evidence to the effect that as a result of
chronic alcoholism the
[applicant] had brain damage in the form of frontal lobe damage, and that by
reason of this brain damage a
defence of diminished responsibility was
established under s 23A of the Crimes Act.  The jury's verdict makes it plain
that the jury
rejected that defence.</i>
<P>

<i>There was evidence in the case that the [applicant] had been drinking
intoxicating liquor.  There was an admission to that effect
in the record of
interview of the [applicant] and in his statement in court the [applicant] said
that he was a heavy drinker and
that he used to drink at least a carton of beer
a day.  It is clear from the jury's verdict that whatever the jury's assessment
was
concerning the effect of any intoxicating liquor upon the [applicant], it
was nevertheless satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that
the [applicant]
intended to kill or that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm or that he
acted with reckless indifference to
human life with the requisite foresight
that death would probably result from his conduct."</i>
<P>

6  	For reasons then expressed, when sentencing the applicant I
rejected a submission made on his behalf that the culpability for
his crime was
significantly diminished by mitigating circumstances.  That submission was
advanced because of the provisions of s
19 of the <i>Crimes Act</i>, since
repealed, which permitted the imposition of a lesser sentence than penal
servitude for life for the crime of murder if it
appeared that <i>"the person's
culpability for the crime [was] significantly diminished by mitigating
circumstances..."</i>
<P>

7  	I do not propose to record in their entirety my reasons at the
time expressed for rejecting that submission, but I summarise
the conclusions I
reached in addressing the features relied upon by the applicant to support that
unsuccessful submission:
<P>

(i)	I was not satisfied that the applicant was significantly affected by
alcohol at the time of the fire.
<P>

(ii)	I accepted the evidence of Dr Milton who concluded that any brain damage
from which the applicant was suffering as a consequence
of alcohol abuse was
mild and did not diminish the applicant's responsibility for his crime.
<P>

(iii)	I was not persuaded that the applicant's conduct in removing his wife
from the caravan or his expression of regret for what
he had done overheard by
a witness after the fire significantly diminished the applicant's
culpability.
<P>

(iv)	I did not find that the quarrel between the applicant and his wife which
preceded the commission of the crime constituted mitigating
circumstances
relevant for the purposes of s 19.
<P>

8  	Having regard to the jury's verdict I find that the applicant did
what he did with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to his
wife.  The
applicant assaulted his wife by grabbing her by the throat and pushing her on
to the bed in the caravan.   He then held
his unfortunate victim down on the
bed whilst he used a cigarette lighter to ignite the methylated spirits he had
splashed on to
the bed.  The circumstances of the commission of this crime are
such as to lead me to conclude that it was brutal and merciless.
 Reviewing the
matter now, I consider there were no mitigating circumstances.  Indeed, Mr Webb
advanced none.
<P>

9  	Section 13A(9) requires that I have regard to the following:
<P>

<i>"(a)	the knowledge of the original sentencing court that a person sentenced
to imprisonment for life was eligible to be released on
licence under section
463 of the Crimes 1900 and of the practice relating the issue of such licences;
and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	any report on the person made by the Review Council and any other
relevant reports prepared after sentence (including, for example,
reports on
the person's rehabilitation), being in either case reports made available to
the Supreme Court; and</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	the need to preserve the safety of the community, and</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	the age of the person (at the time the person committed the offence and
also at the time the Supreme Court deals with the application)".</i>
<P>

10  	I am also required to have regard to <i>"any other relevant
matter"</i>.
<P>

11  	An extensive report of the Serious Offenders Review Council has
been placed before this Court.  This report, dated 18 May 1998,
and some
supplementary and more recent documentation from the Review Council, trace the
applicant's behaviour and progress since
he was sentenced.  The applicant has
also placed before the Court a number of recent certificates and a reference
from the production
supervisor of International Cable Manufacturers for whom
the applicant worked to the satisfaction of the supervisor for a period
of
twelve months.  I have closely considered all this evidence.
<P>

12  	The applicant himself gave no evidence on this application.
<P>

13  	It is to be observed by reference to my sentencing remarks in
1990 that the applicant made admissions to the police in his
record of
interview from which he resiled at his trial.  I note that it is recorded that
when seen by the Visiting Committee on 14
May 1991 the applicant denied having
killed his wife.  Nowhere in the subsequent documents placed before me on the
application is
there any record that he has since acknowledged his guilt.  This
is a relevant consideration on this application:  see <i>Stephens</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/80.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999]
NSWCCA 80</a> and in particular per Sheller JA at paras 35-39.
<P>

14  	The records are otherwise in all respects favourable to this
applicant.  No episode of misconduct has been recorded against
him.  He has
worked well and behaved himself to the complete satisfaction of his supervisors
over the past 10&#189; years in custody.
<P>

15  	The author of the Review Council report dated 18 May 1998
wrote:
<P>

<i>"Throughout his period in incarceration Rosevear has participated in
counselling and therapy programs.  He has a stable personality
and this is
reflected in his good behaviour which is further evidenced by his `nil
punishment' while in custody.</i>
<P>

<i>If his life sentence is redetermined the Serious Offenders Review Council
will develop a management program for Rosevear.  The program
will provide for
progressive reductions in security classifications, leading normally to his
inclusion in unsupervised temporary
leave programs (including day leave and
work release)."</i>
<P>

16  	The applicant presently has a C1 classification at the Goulburn
Correctional Centre.  It is clear from that Centre's records
that further
rehabilitative planning would be assisted by a successful outcome on this
present application and I am satisfied, having
reflected on the evidence, that
I should accede to this application and now determine a minimum term and an
additional term for this
applicant's sentence.  Indeed, Mr Thompson has not
submitted that I should do otherwise.
<P>

17  	The applicant was born on 13 June 1942 so that he is now
fifty-seven years of age.  I must have regard to the applicant's prospects
of
rehabilitation, which I view favourably, but the applicant will require
supervision and assistance from the appropriate authorities
for an extended
period following his eventual release in order to adjust to society and to
guard against any further abuse of alcohol.
<P>

18  	A Victim Impact Statement was placed before the Court from the
victim's son and I note the serious adverse effect that his
mother's death has
had upon her son.  However, whilst I have regard to s 23C(2) of the <i>Criminal
Procedure Act</i>, I must heed and apply the decision in <i>Previtera</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2094%20A%20Crim%20R%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 94 A Crim R 76</a> in determining my approach to my sentencing task.
<P>

19  	I am required to fix a sentence which would have been
appropriate to impose in 1990 had I not then been required to impose
a
mandatory life sentence.  I do however now have the advantage of assessing the
rehabilitation that has occurred since 1990 and
I should and I do take that
progress into account in the applicant's favour.  I must heed all the
considerations appropriate to sentencing,
including the objective gravity of
the offence, retribution and general deterrence.
<P>

20  	In the course of the helpful submissions made by Mr Webb and Mr
Thompson, I was referred to a number of decisions as indicators
to determine an
appropriate sentence:  <i>Sorensen</i> (unreported, Wood J, 6 September 1990);
<i>Perry</i> (unreported, Studdert J, 1 November 1991); <i>Lyttle</i>
(unreported, Newman J, 6 March 1996); <i>Collins</i> (unreported, McInerney J,
20 September 1996); <i>Whitmore</i> ([1999] NSWCCA 75); <i>Stephens</i>
(supra); <i>Baraghith</i> (unreported, Grove J, 28 November 1997); and
<i>Everett</i> (unreported, NSWCCA, 13 December 1995).  I have considered each
of those cases but of course I must heed the particular features
of the present
case in order to arrive at what I consider to be the appropriate sentence.
<P>

21  	In <i>Everett</i>, a case with some features of similarity to
the present one, in which the offender poured petrol on his wife and set fire
to her,
the Court of Criminal Appeal disturbed the sentence imposed at first
instance as manifestly excessive and imposed a sentence of twenty-one
years
with a minimum term of sixteen years and an additional term of five years.  It
is to be observed that in <i>Everett </i>the offence was not committed with
intent to kill.  The sentence in <i>Everett</i> was not one determined under s
13A so, unlike the present case, the court did not have the benefit of
knowledge of the steps taken
by the offender towards his rehabilitation which I
have in considering the applicant's case.
<P>

22  	Mr Webb submitted that this case should be regarded as towards
the bottom of the range of "relationship type matters" and that
I should regard
the gravity of the applicant's offence as being well below the gravity of the
crime in <i>Everett.</i>
<P>

23  	The notion that there was a class of "ordinary domestic murder"
was rejected in <i>Whitmore</i> (supra).  In that case Grove J, with whose
judgment the other members of the court agreed, said at para 16:
<P>

<i>"Reference was made to what was claimed to be a class of `ordinary domestic
murder'.  For my part I would reject the implication that
there is some such
specific classification.  It has been observed that killings within a domestic
situation occur very often when
there has been a build up of tension between
killer and victim over a period of years, and some account may need to be given
to the
frequent circumstance that the offender has acted whilst affected by
stresses and tensions within a relationship.  That is not to
say that existence
of such is necessarily a mitigating circumstance and each case needs to be
assessed in the light of its own facts
but it is often the case that some
mitigation can be found in such circumstances.  That does not establish some
less serious category
of `domestic murder' or any category under similar
label."</i>
<P>

24  	Heeding the above dicta, I do not consider I am assisted by
searching for a range for "relationship type matters".
<P>

25  	Nor do I accept that the gravity of this applicant's offence was
well below that of <i>Everett</i>.  However, whilst recognising as I do
features of similarity in <i>Everett's</i> case, I also recognise those
different features in the present case.  Ultimately, of course, I must arrive
at a sentence which is
appropriate to the applicant's case.  
<P>

26  	That sentence I now determine as follows:  I set a minimum term
of fifteen years penal servitude to date from 16 January 1989
and to expire on
15 January 2004 and an additional term of five years to date from 16 January
2004 and to expire on 15 January 2009.
 I therefore specify 16 January 2004 as
the first date upon which the applicant is to be eligible for release on
parole.
