LANDLORD AND TENANT - RETAIL LEASES ACT.  Prospective tenant spends $30,000 on
preparation of shop, and then goes into possession
and starts paying rent, in
expectation of being granted a lease for not less than 6 months.  Three months
later, in June 1998, tenant
and landlord execute a lease for 6 months with a 6
months option, commencing on 1st July, and solicitor gives a certificate under
s.16 of the Retail Leases Act.  Tenant claims benefit of 5 year lease.  HELD
that, prior to giving of the certificate, a lease had
arisen to which the
Retail Leases Act applied, so that its term was extended to 5 years; and that,
while such a lease could be surrendered,
the execution of the 6 month lease
neither effected such a surrender nor displaced the pre-existing
statute-extended lease.

CORAM:   HODGSON, CJ in Eq.
<P>

<u>Wednesday 11th August 1999</u>
<P>

<b><u>NO. 3390 OF 1999</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>ASPROMONTE PTY. LIMITED   V.   ZAGARI</u></b> 
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiff is the owner of the property 244
Canley Vale Road, Canley Heights, which is also referred to in some
of the
evidence as 244a Canley Vale Road, Canley Heights.  The defendant conducts a
hairdressing business at that address.
<P>

2  	By its summons filed on 27 July 1999, the plaintiff seeks a
declaration that the property is not subject to any interest in
favour of the
defendant other than as a lessee from month to month, and that such leasehold
interest will terminate on 27 August
1999; and an order that caveat number
5951516E lodged by the defendant against a title to that property be
removed.
<P>

3  	By his cross-claim filed on 9 August 1999, the defendant claims a
declaration that he has the benefit of an agreement for lease
of the property
for a term of three years, plus an option for a further three years either from
16 March 1998 or 1 July 1999; or,
alternatively, that he has the benefit of a
lease for four and a half years commencing 16 March 1998, plus a six month
option, pursuant
to the provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act 1994</a>.
<P>

4  	In circumstances where the plaintiff claimed that a final
decision in the matter was urgently required in connection with a
liquor
licensing application, I have dealt with this matter urgently on a final basis.

<P>

<b><u>OUTLINE OF FACTS</u></b>
<P>

5  	I will commence by outlining the facts which seem to me to be
clearly proved, noting at various points some areas of dispute
between the
parties.
<P>

6  	In about December 1997, the defendant was working with his
father, Dominico Zagari, as a hairdresser in a hairdressing business
at Canley
Vale.  Pat Carbone, a director of the plaintiff, then spoke to the defendant
about the possibility of the defendant renting
the subject property.  There are
conflicts in the evidence in that, according to Mr Carbone, the defendant
specifically requested
that he have a short lease of the property, this being
denied by the defendant.  There is a further dispute as to the rent that was
mentioned at this stage, Mr Carbone claiming it was $350 per week and the
defendant claiming it was $300 per week. 
<P>

7  	In about January 1998, the defendant inspected the premises and
decided to open a hairdressing shop there.  According to Mr
Carbone, and also
according to a real estate agent Angelo Esposito, there was a meeting between
those two persons and the defendant
in about January 1998, when the defendant
said that he needed time to fix the shop and that he would like to have a six
month lease
and a six month option.  According to Mr Carbone, the defendant
said that he wanted this lease to commence on 1 July 1998.  The defendant
denies these matters.
<P>

8  	Commencing in about January 1998, the defendant had the shop
prepared for his business.  He submitted a development application
and building
application to Fairfield City Council, and obtained approvals.  He purchased
furniture, fixtures and fittings, and employed
a tiler, plumber, painter and
electrician to do work on the premises.  Over $30,000 was spent on these
matters.  $16,000 of this
was provided by his parents from money borrowed from
Westpac on security of a mortgage entered into for that purpose over the
parents'
home.  $4,500 was provided by the defendant's brother, and about
$13,000 by his sister.  Some of the expenditure was on items such
as stock and
movable furniture, which could be moved and used elsewhere, but at least
$10,000 and probably more was spent on matters
which could not be availed of
elsewhere.  It appears that Mr Carbone gave some physical assistance in the
carrying out of this work.
<P>

9  	According to the defendant, in early 1998 Mr Carbone said to him
words to the effect: "You can stay as long as you like" and
"I will give you a
three year lease with a three year option".  This is denied by Mr Carbone.  The
defendant says that but for statements
such as these he would not have invested
the money which he did on the shop.
<P>

10  	The shop opened for business in about mid-March 1998, probably
on 16 March 1998.  The first rent was paid in early April 1998
by a cheque for
$1,200.  It is common ground that that cheque was in respect of four weeks
rent.
<P>

11  	On about 26 May 1998, Mr Esposito filled out a lessor's
disclosure statement under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act</a>.  This statement showed the
lease period as being 1 June 1998 to 1 January 1999, and that there was an
option, and the option period
was shown as "1/1/99".  The date on which the
shop would be available was shown as 16 March 1998.  The rent was noted as
$1,516.66
monthly, and was shown as being based on $350 per week.
<P>

12  	On or about 26 May, Mr Esposito took this document to the
defendant and the defendant signed to the effect that he had received
it.  Mr
Esposito's records show that the first payment of rent was received by him on
behalf of the plaintiff on 9 June 1998, being
$350 for the period 1 June to 8
June.
<P>

13  	On about 16 June 1998, the defendant attended at the office of a
solicitor, Maria Vukmirica, to sign a lease of the shop. 
That attendance was
arranged by Mr Esposito, who owned the building in which Ms Vukmirica's office
was located, and whose real estate
agency was in the same building.  Mr
Esposito was present at this meeting.
<P>

14  	The lease signed on that occasion provided for a term of six
months commencing 1 July 1998 and terminating on 31 December 1998,
with an
option to renew for six months.  The lease provided for a rent of $1,516.66 per
month for the lease and also for the option
period.  Ms Vukmirica signed a
certificate under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act</a> in respect of that lease.
<P>

15  	The defendant gave evidence to the effect that Mr Carbone was
also present at that meeting.  This was denied by Mr Carbone,
Mr Esposito and
Ms Vukmirica.  The defendant also gave evidence to the effect that, when Ms
Vukmirica pointed out the term of the
lease, he said that he would later be
getting a lease for three years plus a three year option, and that this
assertion was assented
to by both Mr Esposito and Mr Carbone.  That evidence
was denied by Mr Esposito and Ms Vukmirica.  The defendant paid Ms Vukmirica
$120 for her services in relation to the lease.  It appears that he did not get
any copy of the lease, at least until April 1999
or some time thereafter.
<P>

16  	Subsequently to the defendant signing the lease, a further
$2,700 was spent by the defendant and a beautician on merging the
shop with
part of a house on the same land, for use by the beautician in conjunction with
the hairdressing business.
<P>

17  	It is common ground that in 1998 there was a conversation
between Mr Carbone and the defendant about a proposed development
of the
subject property as a tavern, but there is substantial dispute as to the timing
and circumstances of that conversation.  According
to Mr Carbone, it occurred
in July 1998 and it was initiated by him.  According to the defendant, it
occurred in about September
1998 and was the result of his seeing items in
newspapers and raising the matter with Mr Carbone.  
<P>

18  	In about April 1999, the defendant's father was concerned that
his lease in Canley Vale had run out, and he asked the defendant
to show him
the defendant's lease.  The defendant did not have a copy of the lease, and the
defendant's father then obtained documents
relating to the lease from Mr
Esposito and saw that the lease was for six months with a six month option.
The defendant's father
then went to see Mr Carbone and required the entry into
a lease for three years plus a three year option.
<P>

19  	It appears that the defendant consulted his present solicitors
in about May 1999, and that a caveat claiming an entitlement
to a three year
lease and a three year option was lodged at the beginning of July 1999.
<P>

20  	An application  by the plaintiff, or associates of the
plaintiff, for a liquor licence in relation to a proposed tavern development
of
the subject property has been listed for hearing commencing 12 August, that is,
tomorrow.  There is evidence that that application
would be affected by the
defendant's claim.  It is in that circumstance that I have given the case an
urgent final hearing.
<P>

<b><u>ISSUES</u></b>
<P>

21  	The issues that need to be determined by me are, firstly,
certain issues of fact between the parties; secondly, the legal position
of the
parties apart from the effect of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act</a>; and, thirdly, the
effect, if any, of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act</a> on that position.  This third issue
requires some consideration of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 3</a> of the Act and, in particular, the
definition of "retail shop lease or lease" in that section, and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.6</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">8</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">9</a>,
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">11</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">16</a> of the Act.  Those provisions are in the following terms:
<P>

<b><i>6(1)   This Act does not apply to any of the following leases of retail
shops: </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(a)   leases for a term of less than 6 months without any right for the
lessee to extend the lease (whether by means of an option
to extend or renew
the lease or otherwise), and for this purpose a provision for holding over by
the lessee at the end of the term
of the lease is not considered to confer a
right on the lessee to extend the lease if it operates effectively at the
discretion of
the lessor, </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(b)   leases for a term of 25 years or more (with the term of a lease
taken to include any term for which the lease may be extended
or renewed at the
option of the lessee), </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(c)   leases entered into before the commencement of this section,
</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(d)   leases entered into under an option granted or agreement made
before the commencement of this section, </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(e)   any other lease of a class or description prescribed by the
regulations as exempt from this Act. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(2)   This Act does not apply to any lease referred to in this section
that is assigned to another person after the commencement of
this section.
</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>7.	This Act operates despite the provisions of a lease. A provision of a
lease is void to the extent that the provision is inconsistent
with a provision
of this Act. A provision of any agreement or arrangement between the parties to
a lease is void to the extent that
the provision would be void if it were in
the lease. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>8(1)   For the purposes of this Act, a retail shop lease is considered to
have been entered into when a person enters into possession
of the retail shop
as lessee under the lease or begins to pay rent as lessee under the lease
(whichever happens first). </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(2)   However, if both parties execute the lease before the lessee enters
into possession under the lease or begins to pay rent under
the lease, the
lease is considered to have been entered into as soon as both parties have
executed the lease.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>9.	A person must not, as lessor or on behalf of the lessor, offer to
enter into a retail shop lease, invite an offer to enter into
a retail shop
lease or indicate by written or broadcast advertisement that a retail shop is
for lease, unless: </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(a)   the person has in his or her possession a copy of the proposed
retail shop lease (in written form, but not necessarily including
particulars
of the lessee, the rent or the term of the lease) for the purpose of making the
lease available for inspection by a prospective
lessee, and </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(b)   the person makes a copy of the proposed lease available to any
prospective lessee as soon as the person enters into negotiations
with the
prospective lessee concerning the lease. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>...</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>11(1)	At least 7 days before a retail shop lease is entered into, the
lessee must be given a disclosure statement for the lease. A
disclosure
statement is a statement in writing that contains the information, and is
accompanied by the material, that is contained
in or required to complete or
accompany the form of disclosure statement set out in Part 1 of the form
contained in Schedule 2 (but
only to the extent that is relevant to the lease
concerned). The layout of the disclosure statement need not comply with that of
the form set out in Part 1 of the form contained in Schedule 2. However, a
lessor's disclosure statement is complete for the purposes
of this section only
if it has attached to it a form to be completed by the lessee as set out in
Part 2 of the form contained in
Schedule 2.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Note:  Because the disclosure statement need only include information
relevant to the lease, if the retail shop is not in a retail
shopping centre
the disclosure statement need not include information that is relevant only to
shops in retail shopping centres.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(2)   If a lessee was not given a disclosure statement as required by
subsection (1) or if the disclosure statement that was given
to the lessee was
incomplete or contained information that at the time it was given was
materially false or misleading, the lessee
may terminate the lease by notice in
writing to the lessor at any time within 6 months after the lease was entered
into, unless subsection
(3) prevents termination. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(3)   The lessee cannot terminate the lease under this section on the
ground that the disclosure statement is incomplete or contains
information that
is materially false or misleading if: </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(a)   the lessor has acted honestly and reasonably and ought reasonably
to be excused for the failure concerned, and </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(b)   the lessee is in substantially as good a position as the lessee
would have been if the failure had not occurred. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(4)   If a lease is entered into by way of the renewal of a lease, a
written statement (a "lessor's disclosure update") that updates
the provisions
of an earlier disclosure statement given to the lessee is, in conjunction with
that earlier disclosure statement,
considered to be a disclosure statement
given for the purposes of this section at the time the lessor's disclosure
update is given.
</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(5)   The termination of a lease under this section does not affect any
right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued
or incurred under
the lease in respect of any period before its termination. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(6)   A lessor under a retail shop lease is guilty of an offence if
subsection (1) is not complied with in relation to the lease.
</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>...</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>16(1)   The term for which a retail shop lease is entered into, together
with any further term or terms provided for by any agreement
or option for the
acquisition by the lessee of a further term as an extension or renewal of the
lease, must not be less than 5 years.
An agreement or option is not taken into
account if it was entered into or conferred after the lease was entered into.
</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(2)   If a lease is entered into in contravention of this section, the
validity of the lease is not thereby affected but the term
of the lease is
extended by such period as may be necessary to prevent the lease contravening
this section.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Note.  For example, if a lease is entered into for a term of 3 years, its
term is extended by 2 years to 5 years. If a lease is entered
into for a term
of 2 years with an option for a further 1 year after that initial 2 years, the
term of the lease is extended to 4
years (with the option for a further 1 year
after that initial 4 years).</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(3)   This section does not apply to a lease if a lawyer, or a licensed
conveyancer, not acting for the lessor certifies in writing
that he or she has,
at the request of the prospective lessee, explained the effect of subsections
(1) and (2) to the prospective
lessee and that the giving of the certificate
will result in this section not applying to the lease. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(4)   This section does not apply to a lease that results from the
renewal of an earlier lease pursuant to an option conferred on
the lessee, so
long as there was no break in the entitlement of the lessee to possession of
the retail shop and the option was granted
by that earlier lease or by an
agreement entered into before or at the same time as that earlier lease was
entered into. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Note. </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Because of subsection (4), a lease will not be required to be for 5 years
if it is a renewal of an earlier lease (because the minimum
5 year term
requirement applied to the earlier lease and the availability of the renewal
will have been taken into account in determining
the term of that earlier
lease).</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(5)   This section does not apply to a lease to the extent that its
application would be inconsistent with the terms of any head lease
under which
the lessor holds the retail shop.</i></b>
<P>

22  	Sections 16 to 19 are in Pt.2 of the Act which is entitled
"Before the Lease is Entered Into".
<P>

<b><u>SUBMISSIONS</u></b>
<P>

23  	Mr Kidd, for the defendant, submitted in relation to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail
Leases Act</a> that there was no dispute that the subject property was a retail
shop within the meaning of the Act.  He submitted that the effect
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 8</a> of the
Act was that a lease was entered into in about March 1998.  He pointed out that
accordingly there had been breaches of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.9</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">11</a> of the Act, although he made
no submission that any consequences relating to this dispute flowed from those
breaches.
<P>

24  	He submitted that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.16(3)</a> of the Act was not effectual to
protect the plaintiff from the consequence of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.16(1)</a> of the Act, namely, that
the plaintiff had the benefit of a five year lease commencing in March 1998.
He submitted that this was
so for two reasons.
<P>

25  	The first reason was that this certificate was given after the
lease had been entered into, whereas it could be effectual only
if given before
the lease was entered into.  The scheme of the Act was to ensure that before
any lease within the Act is entered
into, various things happen by way of
disclosure and information to the lessee, including advice concerning the
effect of the Act;
and that the idea was that the lessee should not become in
any way bound or committed to a lease until these things had happened.
 This
was confirmed by the title of Pt.2 of the Act, and also by the words
"prospective lessee" in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.16(3).</a>
<P>

26  	The second reason Mr Kidd advanced for the proposition that the
certificate was not effectual to protect the plaintiff was
that it was not
given by a lawyer "not acting for the lessor" within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.16(3).</a>  Mr Kidd pointed
out that in this case the solicitor had acted previously for the lessor; was a
tenant of the lessor's agent and
thus beholden to that agent and not truly
independent; had given the advice and certificate in the presence of the
lessor's agent
and perhaps the lessor's principal; had done so at a meeting
arranged by the lessor's agent; handed the bill for the meeting to the
lessor's
agent; had voluntarily made an affidavit in these proceedings at the request of
the lessor without any communication to
the defendant or his legal
representatives as to whether privilege was waived; and gave the signed lease
to the lessor's agent, making
no arrangements for a copy to go to the
lessee.
<P>

27  	Mr Kidd further submitted that, even if this certificate was
somehow effective to prevent the written lease expanding into
a five year
lease, it was not effective to bring about the end of a pre-existing lease
extended by force of the statute to five years.
 Mr Kidd submitted that such a
pre-existing lease could only be ended by an express surrender, not by being
displaced simply through
the legal operation of the subsequent written
lease.
<P>

28  	Turning to the question of the position apart from the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail
Leases Act</a>, Mr Kidd submitted that the defendant's expenditure on the property
was incompatible with there being an agreement that the defendant
should only
have a six month lease and six month option.  He submitted that I should accept
the evidence of the defendant that he
was expressly promised a three year lease
and a three year option in early 1998, and also subsequently prior to the
execution of
the written lease.  I should also accept the father's evidence
that an assurance was given by Mr Carbone that the defendant could
stay in the
shop as long as he liked.
<P>

29  	Mr Kidd submitted that such an agreement could be enforced
notwithstanding the absence of writing because the expenses on the
shop would
amount to part performance, and on that matter I was referred to the case of
<u>Watson v Delaney</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20NSW%20ConvR%2055%2d572" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) NSW ConvR 55-572.</a>  He also submitted that by its
definition of "retail shop lease" in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.3</a> and by the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.8(1)</a>, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail
Leases Act</a> displaced the requirements of provisions such as s.54A of the
Conveyancing Act for writing; and he referred me to a decision of <u>El Chiekh
v Gratsis</u>, unreported, Hamilton J., 4 July 1997, in support of that
submission.
<P>

30  	Dr Birch, for the plaintiff, submitted that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.8(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail
Leases Act</a> only applies where the entry into possession or payment of rent is
under "the lease".  When there is an agreement that the lease
commence on a
future date, then that provision does not apply.  In this case he submitted, on
the evidence of Mr Carbone, there was
an agreement in about January or February
1998 that the lease not commence until 1 July.  In any event, Dr Birch
submitted the Act
would not apply to any lease in this case other than the
written lease signed in June 1998, because apart from that lease there was
no
lease for a term of six months or more, so that the application of the Act was
excluded by the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.6(1)(a).</a>
<P>

31  	In relation to the written lease, the Act would have
application, but the solicitor's certificate was effectual to prevent
that
lease being expanded into a five year lease. It was given before the
commencement of that lease on 1 July, and was given to
a prospective lessee of
that lease commencing 1 July.  Even if that submission were not accepted, Dr
Birch submitted that a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.16(3)</a> certificate is effectual even if given after a
lease has been entered into, or has commenced.  He contrasted other provisions
of
Pt.2, such as <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.11(1)</a>, which expressly provided that certain things should
happen before a lease is entered into.
<P>

32  	Dr Birch also submitted that Ms Vukmirica in this case was
plainly not acting for the lessor.  The fact that she had on one
previous
occasion acted for the lessor, and the involvement of the lessor's agent in the
meeting, was not enough to displace the
situation, that plainly she regarded
herself as acting for the lessee in advising the lessee on the lease and, in
particular, on
the effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.16</a> of the Act.
<P>

33  	In relation to the volunteering of the affidavit to the lessor,
Dr Birch submitted that this was not a situation giving rise
to legal
professional privilege, because the presence of the lessor's agent, expressly
consented to by the lessee, indicated that
it was not an occasion of
confidential communications.  In any event, both parties in their evidence in
this case had put in issue
what was said at this meeting, the defendant relying
on some of the conversations to support his claim of an express agreement for
the grant of a three year lease and three year option.  In those circumstances
any legal professional privilege, if it might otherwise
exist, was plainly
waived.  Dr Birch also submitted that the solicitor owed some duty to the
plaintiff in relation to the giving
of such a certificate.
<P>

34  	Turning to the position apart from the effect of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail
Leases Act</a>, Dr Birch submitted that it was not shown that more than around
$10,000 irrecoverable expenditure had been incurred.  This was not
a large sum,
in circumstances where the defendant was given at least twelve months, and
where there was no suggestion in the evidence
that the defendant was to be
required to leave immediately on the expiration of that twelve months.  The
evidence was to the effect
that, but for the problems arising from the
defendant's claim and the lodging of the caveat, the defendant would probably
have been
permitted to stay well beyond the twelve months.  In circumstances
where the defendant was not committing himself to any long period
but was
hopeful of having, in fact, a substantial period if the success of his venture
justified it, he might reasonably have judged
his commercial interest to be
such as to undertake that relatively small expenditure.
<P>

35  	Dr Birch submitted that I should prefer the evidence of Ms
Vukmirica to that of the defendant in relation to what was said
at that
meeting.  He submitted that an explanation proffered by the defendant for the
circumstances of that meeting, namely, a suggestion
that otherwise he would be
incurring legal fees of around $5,000, was wholly implausible.  He submitted
that, having regard to the
father's evidence and particularly the oral
evidence, the likelihood is that the suggestion of a three year lease and three
year
option originated from the father in about April 1999.
<P>

<b><u>FACTUAL DISPUTES</u></b>
<P>

36  	I will first consider the factual disputes in the matter.  In
relation to those disputes I am not satisfied that I can rely
on the detail or
even the substance of the evidence of any of Mr Carbone, Mr Esposito or the
defendant.
<P>

37  	As regards Mr Carbone, his evidence was that the agreement right
from the start provided for $350 per week rent.  This evidence
did not sit well
with the evidence that the first payment of rent for a period of four weeks was
in the sum of $1,200, and I was
unconvinced by Mr Carbone's attempted
explanation of this in the witness box, that the defendant at the time of
payment requested
that the lessor "look after me this month" and that he
acceded then to that request.
<P>

38  	Further, Mr Carbone's evidence that, in about January 1998, the
defendant explicitly asked for a six month lease and six month
option,
commencing 1 July 1998, appears to me to be wholly implausible and unlikely.
It also conflicts with the disclosure statement
drawn up in May 1998, showing
the commencement of the lease as being 1 June 1998.
<P>

39  	As regards Mr Esposito, he also gave evidence that a sum of $350
per week was agreed at least by February 1998, and I do not
accept that
evidence for the same reason as I have given.  He also gave evidence to the
effect that a six month lease plus six month
option was expressly agreed in
February 1998, and yet advances no satisfactory explanation as to why no
disclosure statement was
prepared until 26 May and no lease is entered into
until about the middle of June.
<P>

40  	As regards the defendant, he steadfastly maintained that Mr
Carbone was at the meeting with the solicitor, and that he expressly
referred
to his entitlement to a three year lease plus three year option at that
meeting.  I accept the solicitor's denial of these
matters.
<P>

41  	Having regard to my views of those witnesses, I am not satisfied
that there was any express mention of a three year lease plus
a three year
option at any time prior to April 1999.  However, I think it probable that
something was said by Mr Carbone in the early
stages to the effect that the
defendant could stay as long as he liked, and that a statement along those
lines played a part in inducing
the defendant to undertake the expenditure
which he undertook.  However, I also accept that at this time the defendant was
indicating
that he did not want to commit himself to any long term arrangement
at that stage.
<P>

<b><u>LEGAL POSITION APART FROM <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">RETAIL LEASES ACT</a></u></b>
<P>

42  	I will next consider the legal position of the parties, apart
from the effect of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act</a>.  It follows from my factual finding
that there is no agreement between the parties for a three year lease plus a
three year option.
 There may be a question as to whether the defendant might
be entitled to sum equitable relief for the expenditure incurred in reliance
on
what must have been fairly vague assurances by Mr Carbone that he could stay as
long as he wished. 
<P>

43  	In circumstances where the defendant was not committing himself
to any long-term arrangement, it seems to me that the only
equitable relief
which would be contemplated would be some kind of compensation.  However, I
have no evidence of the proportionality
of what was spent to the expected
proceeds of the business over twelve months, or any other period which might be
relevant to consider,
and the evidence does not justify a finding of any loss
of anything more than $10,000.  In those circumstances I do not think a case
is
made out for equitable relief on the basis of expenditure.
<P>

<b><u>EFFECT OF <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">RETAIL LEASES ACT</a></u></b>
<P>

44  	Finally, I consider the effect of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act</a>.  
<P>

45  	In my opinion, if one confines attention to the written lease
for the term of 1 July 1998 to 30 December 1998, plus a six month
option, then
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.16</a> would not have the effect of extending the term of that lease to five
years, or four and a half years plus a six month option.  In
my opinion,
confining one's attention to that lease alone, the certificate given by Ms
Vukmirica was valid.  In relation to that
written lease, the defendant could
properly be described as "a prospective lessee".
<P>

46  	In my opinion, the matters referred to by Mr Kidd are not enough
to preclude the finding, which I make, that Ms Vukmirica was
a lawyer not
acting for the lessor.  It may have been preferable for her to have some
expressed authorisation from the defendant
before making the affidavit which
she made, but ultimately no objection was taken to the affidavit on the basis
of legal professional
privilege; and I think there is much force in Dr Birch's
submission that, having regard to the presence of the lessor's agent, this
was
not a situation of confidence which would give rise to legal professional
privilege.  I accept Ms Vukmirica's evidence to the
effect that she enquired
from the defendant whether he wished Mr Esposito to stay, and that the
defendant indicated at least his
concurrence to that situation.
<P>

47  	In my opinion, the difficult question is whether there was some
lease relating to a period prior to 1 July 1998 which was extended
by the
statute to be a lease for five years; and if there was, was this lease
displaced by the written lease or in some other way
precluded from being a
lease for five years as a result of the solicitor's certificate.  
<P>

48  	In my opinion the entry into possession of the shop on the
payment of rent meant that there was some kind of lease in existence
from about
the middle of March.  This, in my opinion, would be so at general law, and it
would be confirmed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.8</a> of the Act.  The first difficult question is whether
any such lease as that would be excluded from the operation of the Act by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.6(1)(a).</a>
<P>

49  	It appears that the intention of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.6(1)(a)</a> is to exclude from
the operation of the Act leases which are of such a short duration that it is
not appropriate to impose the provisions
of the Act in relation to those
leases.  On the facts as I have found them, at the time of entry into
possession and commencement
of payment of rent, no agreement or consensus was
established as to any particular term.  The expenditure of the $30,000 perhaps
suggests an expectation held by both parties that the occupation would be for,
at least, six months.  The disclosure statement of
26 May suggests a consensus
at that stage that the lease should be for a period from 1 June 1998 to 1
January 1999.  Both sides in
different ways also state in evidence that there
was a consensus that there should be a six month lease and six month option
arrived
at some time before the actual signing of the lease, and I am satisfied
that there was, in fact, such a consensus.
<P>

50  	It seems to me that there is a question whether, for a lease to
be excluded by the force of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.6(1)(a)</a>, there has to be an agreement between the
lessor and lessee for a term shorter than six months; or whether it is
sufficient that
there be a mere lack of legally enforceable agreement for a
term equal to or greater than six months.  However, whichever approach
one
takes on that question, it seems to me that, if there is entry into possession
of a shop and payment of rent during negotiations
for a lease of at least six
months, and such a lease is subsequently entered into, the effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.8</a> is
that the Act requires that the lease which is ultimately entered into be
considered as having been entered into at the earlier
time; and it seems to me
further that that lease is not excluded from the operation of the Act by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.6(1)(a).</a>
<P>

51  	In an earlier decision of mine in <u>Whiteway House No.199 Pty
Ltd v Abracoona Pty Ltd</u>, 29 May 1998, unreported, I said this in relation
to the construction of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.8(i):</a>
<P>

<b><i>It would be possible to give a construction to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.8(1)</a> to the effect that
there cannot be entry into possession as lessee under a lease, or payment of
rent as lessee under a lease, unless
the lease is already in existence in the
full sense of the word; that is, unless there had already been a formally
executed lease
or at least a concluded agreement.  However, in my opinion that
construction of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.8(1)</a> should be rejected, particularly having regard to the
terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.8(2).</a>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 8(2)</a> deals with a situation where both parties
execute the lease before the lessee enters into possession under the lease, or
begins to
pay rent under the lease.  Those words, in my opinion, clearly
contemplate the possibility that the lease may not be executed by
both parties
until after the lessee has entered into possession under the lease, or has
begun to pay rent under the lease.  That
means in my opinion that the words
"under the lease" in both subsections should not be given a narrow and
restricted construction,
but rather should be considered to be satisfied where
thee is entry into possession or payment of rent pursuant to a consensus as
to
terms which is subsequently given effect to by an executed lease.  That is a
situation which happens very commonly, and in my
opinion that is the situation
which the section is intended to deal with.</i></b>
<P>

52  	I remain of the view that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 8(1)</a> discloses an intention that
there can be entry into a retail shop as lessee and payment of rent as lessee
under a lease, where these
events occur at a time when there is consensus as to
the terms of such a lease but not yet any written lease entered into.
<P>

53  	In my opinion the effect of these views in this case is that
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.8(1)</a> there must be considered to have been a lease effected by the Act
commencing in about mid-March 1998.  That lease would then be extended
to a
period of five years with four and a half years plus a six month option, unless
that is excluded by the effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.16(3).</a>  
<P>

54  	In my opinion a lease extended in that way by force of the
statute could be surrendered by agreement between lessor and lessee.
 It seems
to me that the question in this case is whether it can be superseded or
displaced by a written lease commencing at a different
date and with a term of
six months plus a six month option.
<P>

55  	Having regard to the terms particularly of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7</a> of the Act, I am
of the view that the entry into such a written lease would not, by force of
that entry alone, displace a lease extended
by statute in the way I have
described.  In my opinion such a situation is not the same as a surrender by
the lessee of a lease extended
by the terms of the statute.
<P>

56  	One further reason why, in my opinion, the lease commencing on
16 March, and extended to a period of five years by the statute,
would not be
affected by the certificate that was given in this case, is that in relation to
that lease the defendant was not a prospective
lessee within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.15(3)</a>; and I
think that that approach is supported by the heading of Pt.2 of the Act which,
in my opinion, confirms the legislative intention
that the matters dealt with
in Pt.2 take place before a lease is entered into.  In my opinion it is
consistent with the whole scheme
of the Act that the lessee be given adequate
information about what the lessee is to be involved in before the lessee
becomes involved
in a lease to which the Act applies.
<P>

57  	For those reasons, in my opinion, the defendant does have the
benefit of the Act, subject to one matter.  I am not sure if
there is anywhere
in the evidence an indication of acceptance and commitment by the defendant to
a lease for a period of four and
a half years.  If the defendant is to claim
the benefit of such a lease, it seems to me that there must be an agreement or
commitment
by the defendant to be bound by those terms for his part, so that he
would not be able to walk away if he decides it is not in his
interest to
continue with such a lease.  At present my view is that such an agreement can
be indicated at this stage, but I would
be prepared to hear further submissions
on that.
<P>

58  	In relation to the terms of the lease, it seems to me that the
terms of the written document, insofar as they are not inconsistent
with the
lease to which I have referred, would apply.
