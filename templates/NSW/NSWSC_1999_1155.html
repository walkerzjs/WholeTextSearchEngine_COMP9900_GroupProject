<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  The present problem for resolution is not
without some complexity.
<P>

2   	On 10 November 1998, a claim for "<i>privilege" </i>was
made in respect of copies of what are now marked as confidential exhibits A and
B, being respectively confidential exhibit RWP1
and RWP2 to the affidavit of
Richard William Potter, sworn 26 November this year.  The claim for privilege
asserted on 10 November
last year has not hitherto been tested.
<P>

3   	Confidential exhibits A and B are described in Mr Potter's
affidavit as follows:  as to A, (being RWP1), it is described as
a "<i>true
copy of a seven paged unsigned draft report from Dr Dent dated 18 May
1998"</i>. RWP1, exhibit A, coincides with that description, save for there
being nothing on its face to indicate that it is a draft.
<P>

4   	RWP2 is described "<i>as a true copy of a letter dated 29
May, with the enclosure which was caused to be sent to Dr Dent on or about that
date"</i>.  The description of the true copy of a letter cannot be impugned.
The enclosure, on its face, appears to be identical in its content
to RWP1, and
I stress the word "<i>content</i>", except that it bears a signature.  It is
the signature of Dr Dent.
<P>

5   	RWP1 is an unsigned report.  The second part of RWP2
appears to be a signed report, the contents of which are identical to
RWP 1.
<P>

6   	There is another feature of the second part of RWP2 in it,
and it is that it contains annotations, as I will describe them.
<P>

7   	Yesterday there was admitted into evidence what is now
exhibit F.  The first component is the report dated 18 May 1998 from
Dr Dent to
Marsdens Attorneys at Campbelltown, (admitted save for certain paragraphs on
page 4).  I should state that the copy I
have of that report which forms part
of exhibit F is unsigned.  Whether anything turns on that I do not know.
<P>

8   	The tender was attended by what might be described as a
"<i>fuss"</i>, and I do not use that in any disparaging sense; it is a word
that occurs to me.
<P>

9   	What happened apparently was that the documents initially
tendered, insofar as they included the report of 18 May 1998 and
were handed to
Mr Stitt Q.C. for the defendant, contained a report of 18 May 1998 that had not
been served.  That problem was resolved
at that time by the unserved report of
that date being replaced by the served report of the same date, by it being
notified that
in relation to the other and longer unserved report, a claim for
privilege would be made, and by Mr Stitt agreeing not to cross-examine
Dr Dent
in relation to the unserved seven page report at least until such time as the
privilege claim was resolved.
<P>

10   	Cross-examination duly proceeded today, during the course
of which Dr Dent was asked questions as to his state of knowledge
in May of
1998 in relation to certain proceedings said to have been instituted by a
litigant against Mr Marsden claiming damages
for sexual assault.  The question
as originally framed was disallowed because of its generality as to time.  In
its final form it
was focused, as I have indicated.
<P>

11   	What then happened is of critical importance.
<P>

12   	Dr Dent consulted a document, now marked for
identification 21, presently on the witness box, before giving what I
understood
to be an affirmative answer.  Thereupon there crystallised the
occasion for the determination of the claim for privilege in relation
to
confidential exhibits A and B.  Before I proceed I should add that the evidence
on the application includes an affidavit of Mr
Bechara sworn today, and
confidential exhibit C (NB 1), which is described as the seven page draft
report of Dr Dent bearing date
18 May 1998, and which is signed by Dr Dent.  If
Mr Bechara's evidence sworn to in his affidavit and the exhibit has any
relevance,
it is really to a subsidiary question as to whether there has been a
waiver of any privilege, absent any other circumstance that
would permit access
to MFI 21.
<P>

13   	I am of the view that confidential exhibits A and B are
privileged, taking into account the definitions in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 117</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence
Act</a>.</i>  I am of the view that insofar as the division of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence
Act</a></i> which provides the attribution of privilege to those documents is
concerned, by reason of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122</a> (6) the adducing of evidence of MFI 21 has not
been prevented and that is by reason of the use made of it in the witness box
by Dr
Dent.
<P>

14   	In relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(6)</a>, it speaks in terms of using a
document to try and revive the witness's memory.  That appeared to me to be
clearly what happened.
 Whether the fact that the attempt, or the trying, was
successful, to me does not seem to me to be too much to the point.  He
attempted
to do so.  He used the document and gave his testimony.  That
situation, in my view, on reading <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(6)</a>, is different from the circumstances
referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 32</a> which commences with a proscribing by the Act of a witness
using a document to revive memory in the course of giving evidence.  Thus
a
stage has been reached where I am of the view that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(6)</a> operates to permit
the adducing of the evidence.
<P>

15   	Submissions were also made in relation to s 126B dealing
with professional confidential  relationship privilege founded upon
the
relationship of doctor and patient, to put it shortly.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s126.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 126</a> B provides
that the court may direct that evidence not be adduced in a proceeding if the
court finds the adducing of it would disclose
a protected confidence or the
contents of a document recording a protected confidence (sub-paragraphs (1)(a)
and (b)).  I decline
to give any such direction under s 126B, the reasons being
as provided for by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s126.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 126</a> B <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">subsection 4</a> (a) and (b): the probative value
of the evidence in the proceedings, and the importance of the evidence in the
proceedings.  The
evidence relates to a critical component of the plaintiff's
claim for damages. That component of the claim for damages, shortly stated,
is
the allegation of the suffering of psychiatric illness by reason of the
publication of the programs which the jury has found to
have defamed Mr
Marsden.  The issue of course is whether the illness was suffered and what
caused it if it was and is being suffered.
 A critical component of the
determination of such matters is what has hitherto been referred to as
"<i>stressors"</i>.
<P>

16   	Another relevant component of the examination of that
issue is of course the general one of the admission into evidence of
the
opinion of an expert and its being tested as to its internal integrity, if I
might put it that way, and it being tested in relation
to that upon which the
opinion is based.  I have elucidated, I trust, those reasons for not giving a
direction under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s126.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 126</a> B because they would be the factors upon which I would
rely, in any event, if I was called upon to exercise my discretion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 135</a>,
which I would exercise in favour of such evidentiary deployment as may take
place in relation to MFI 21.
<P>

17   	Finally, in submissions, reference was made to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s126.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 126</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s126.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 126</a> would operate to allow a document, <i>other
than</i> MFI 21 to be used to enable a proper understanding of MFI 21.  What
has happened is the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(6)</a> has not prevented the adducing of
evidence, so that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s126.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 126</a> really, in my view, has no application.  Once it is
available pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(6)</a>, MFI 21 of course can be used in whatever way,
for example, to elucidate, if necessary, exhibit 7.
<P>

18   	This ruling relates only, at this stage, to MFI 21.  It
has been the only document within the ambit of the privilege claim
to which any
ruling effectively can relate. Accordingly, in relation to MFI 21 I rule that
no claim for privilege is available to
prevent its being adduced into evidence
or otherwise being the subject of cross-examination.
