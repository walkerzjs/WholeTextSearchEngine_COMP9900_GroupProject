<b>REMARKS ON SENTENCE</b>
<P>

1    	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>The prisoner, Choi Kia Tang, has
been found guilty by a jury of the murder of David Laxalle at Berala on 24
February 1997.
<P>

2    	For some months prior to his death Mr Laxalle had
been living with his mother at 19 McDonald Street Berala, following the
breakdown of his marriage.  On the night of Sunday, 23 February 1997, the
prisoner and three young companions were stealing mangoes
from trees in the
backyard of that home.  Mr Laxalle observed this and pursued the men into
McDonald Street.  He seized one of them
and there was a struggle, in which the
prisoner and the other two men engaged themselves.  
<P>

3    	It is unnecessary to examine in any detail the
evidence of what then occurred.  It is sufficient to say that Mr Laxalle was
punched and fell to the ground, where he was kicked.  In a videotaped interview
with police at the scene, which he adopted in the
trial as his best
recollection of these events, the prisoner claimed that Mr Laxalle seized him
by the shirt and punched him in the
head. For his part, he admitted having
punched Mr Laxalle in the head and having kicked him two or three times to the
head and body.
<P>

4    	In the course of the struggle Mr Laxalle was stabbed
seven times to the torso and upper left arm.  In the light of the jury's
verdict, I am satisfied that it was the prisoner who inflicted all of those
wounds.  One of the other young men admitted having a
knife, but I could not
fairly conclude that he used it.  Even if he had, it would have no significant
bearing upon the prisoner's
culpability.
<P>

5    	Mr Laxalle managed to make his way back to his
mother's home, where she ministered to him as best she could and summoned help.
Sadly, it was necessary for her to give evidence about this in the trial.  He
was conveyed by ambulance to Westmead Hospital, where
he died the following
morning.
<P>

6    	For the purpose of sentence, I accept that the
prisoner became involved in the attack to free his companion and that Mr
Laxalle
did strike him.  This in no way excuses his behaviour but it underlines
the spontaneous nature of the attack, during which, no doubt,
the prisoner was
in a state of high emotion.  I have no idea why he had a knife that night, as
he has never admitted that he did.
 However, there is no basis upon which I
could find that he was carrying it with the intention of stabbing anyone.  From
the jury's
verdict it follows that he intended to inflict at least grievous
bodily harm upon Mr Laxalle but, despite the number and nature of
the wounds, I
am not satisfied that he intended to kill.
<P>

7    	This is not to ignore the community's abhorrence of
young men carrying knives in circumstances such as these.  That abhorrence
is
justified by the type of situation which brings the prisoner before this Court:
an unexpected eruption of violence leading to
the use of a knife aggressively
and, far too often, fatally.  The sentence which I pass, whilst recognising the
spontaneous nature
of this killing, must reflect that community concern.
<P>

8    	The prisoner was eighteen years old at the time of
the incident, and is now twenty.  His three companions were sixteen years
old
at the time.  Each of them pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily
harm and was dealt with by a non-custodial order.
 Clearly, the prisoner stands
in a very different position and must face a substantial custodial sentence.
<P>

9    	The prisoner has a minor record in the Children's
Court, which is of no present significance. He was born in Cambodia, the
youngest of eight children.  It seems that his father was killed by the Pol Pot
regime.  At the age of six he came to this country
with his mother and most of
his siblings.  He has no memory of his father or, indeed, of his country of
origin.
<P>

10    	As one would expect, this background had an adverse
effect upon his family life.  His mother was a stressful person and they
were
in financial difficulty.  He had difficulty communicating with his mother, who
never learnt English, and he felt unable to provide
her with the support and
sympathy she deserved from her experiences in Cambodia.  Despite this, he
progressed satisfactorily at school,
completing the school certificate.  On
leaving school, he obtained employment and at the time of his arrest he was
undertaking a
trade course conducted by the Commonwealth Employment Service.

<P>

11    	From the age of twelve he had had the benefit of
attendance at residential camps for disadvantaged children arranged by the
Uniting Church.  At the trial his counsel led oral evidence and tendered a
number of testimonials from people involved in that program,
all of whom had
observed him to be industrious, courteous and helpful.  Mr Robert Urquhart, who
gave oral evidence, said that his
reliability led to his being appointed a
volunteer youth leader at the camps, and that he had never seen him act
aggressively.  Clearly,
his behaviour at the time of this tragic incident was
out of character.
<P>

12    	A psychological report by Ms Katherine Barrier,
prepared for the purpose of sentence, reveals that the prisoner is of below
average intelligence and lacks self-esteem.  He had been living away from the
family home in the period leading up to the killing
and, on the history he
provided to Ms Barrier, he appears to have been under pressure from a shortage
of money and the competing
demands of his job, his course and his family
commitments.  Ms Barrier considered that he is in need of counselling which, I
trust,
will be available to him in prison.  
<P>

13    	It is pleasing to note that, since he has been in
custody, he has been furthering his general education and has enjoyed the
continuing support of his family.  Although his prospects of rehabilitation are
good, I consider that that end would be furthered
by an extended period of
supervision and the sanction of parole after he has served the custodial
component of his sentence.  Accordingly,
I find special circumstances within
the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s5(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act </i>1989</a>, although only a minor
departure from the statutory norm is warranted. 
<P>

14    	The sentence which I pass must reflect the gravity
of his crime, while giving appropriate weight to his age, his background
and
character, and the desirability of his rehabilitation.  All those matters must
also be reflected in the minimum term, bearing
in mind that his release on
parole is a matter for the Parole Board, not for me.  The sentence will date
from the date he was taken
into custody, 23 March 1997.
<P>

15    	Choi Kia Tang, you are sentenced to penal servitude
for fifteen years, comprising a minimum term of eleven years, commencing
on 23
March 1997 and expiring on 22 March 2008, and an additional term of four years,
commencing on 23 March 2008 and expiring on
22 March 2012.
