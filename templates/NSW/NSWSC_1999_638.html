<P>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>

1   	On 9 April 1999 I handed down a judgment, still to be
formally entered, in which Ms Wentworth as Plaintiff was unsuccessful
in
obtaining costs -- sought on an indemnity basis -- against Deputy Registrar
Howe and the Crown in the right of the state of New
South Wales arising from
the failed taxation before Deputy Registrar Howe. She was partially successful
in obtaining costs from the
Defendant, but not on an indemnity basis and only
for the period that the Defendant played an active role in the disqualification
proceedings before me. Ms Wentworth subsequently sought a review and alteration
of that decision and the contemplated orders. This
was insofar as such
orders:
<P>

(a)	denied costs against Deputy Registrar Howe and the State and gave only
partial recovery against the Defendant, and
<P>

(b)	depended on the reasons of the Court of Appeal in its judgment of 21
February 1996 and its orders in precluding any recovery
of costs in proceedings
before Master McLaughlin where these preceded reconsideration by the taxing
officer, and
<P>

(c)	deferred consideration of any recovery of costs otherwise relating to the
taxation, pending completion of the fresh assessment
of costs sought by Ms
Wentworth to be conducted in accordance with the contemplated orders. 
<P>

2   	My decision of 9 April 1999 arose out of the review by this
Court in its supervisory jurisdiction of Deputy Registrar Howe's
decision not
to disqualify himself on the ground of bias and/or apprehended bias. It led to
the taxation being substantially set
aside on the ground of apparent bias. That
is recorded in my judgment of 6 February 1998 in which I concluded that he "so
conducted
the taxation as to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of the
possibility of bias". It followed that his various determinations
in the
taxation were set aside, save for three interim certificates. That decision is
part of satellite litigation whose expanding
ramifications have occupied
enormous resources of this Court over an extended period. It concerns the
taxation of costs arising out
of Ms Wentworth's original application for an
order under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</i> 1982</a> (NSW). The principal defendant
in that complex of litigation is the Plaintiff's brother Peter Wentworth, who
for financial reasons
has in recent times declined to play any active role.
<P>

3   	The jurisdiction to re-open is, as I explain, an
exceptional jurisdiction. It is to be exercised only where warranted.
Otherwise,
public policy in favour of finality in litigation will be
jeopardised. The question here is whether its invocation is indeed justified.
It is clearly important that courts in the interests of justice do not fail to
recognise when those exceptional circumstances are
made out. No less important,
is that unjustified applications are discouraged.
<P>

4   	The matters presently before me are two. First, whether I
should set aside or vary my earlier judgment of 9 April 1999. Second,
whether
the orders I foreshadowed should be made having regard to the answer to that
question. In considering these questions, I
have had, as previously,
submissions by the Plaintiff in writing and orally, and the assistance of Dr
Birch as amicus curiae. 
<P>

5   	In order to deal with this application in a way which
clearly delineates the proper approach to be taken, I have gone to some
trouble
to set out the guiding principles and then their application to the
circumstances before me.
<P>

<b>SETTING ASIDE OR VARYING A JUDGMENT OR ORDER -- THE RELEVANT
PRINCIPLES</b>
<P>

6   	The jurisdiction to set aside or vary a judgment prior to
entry of judgment or the relevant order had its origin in the common
law power
in that behalf. That jurisdiction is recognised in the <i>Supreme Court
Rules</i>; see Pt 40 rr9 and 10. Apart from the so-called "slip rule" a court
has an inherent power at common law to review, correct or alter
its judgment or
orders <i>before</i> the judgment or order has been entered. This is a power
which applies both to a single judge or an appellate court including the
High
Court. It is exemplified in <i>Smith v NSW Bar Association (No 2)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20176%20CLR%20256" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992)
176 CLR 256</a>, <i>Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 6</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20176%20CLR%20300" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 176 CLR 300</a>; <i>State
Rail Authority of NSW v Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/51.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20150%20CLR%2029" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 150 CLR 29</a> and
<i>Yenald Nominees Pty Ltd v Como Investments Pty Ltd &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20ATPR%2041%2d508" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) ATPR
41-508.</a>
<P>

7   	However, even <i>after</i> a court's judgment or order has
been perfected by entry, the jurisdiction to reopen may be exercised, though
the circumstances must
again be exceptional. As Walsh J said in <i>Bailey v
Marinoff</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1971/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1971] HCA 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%20125%20CLR%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) 125 CLR 529</a> at 535 and speaking generally of the
jurisdiction to reopen before or after judgment is perfected, courts have not
been disposed
to extend the range of circumstances in which their inherent
jurisdiction to set aside or vary judgments and orders may be invoked,
or to
treat that jurisdiction as allowing variations in judgments or orders whenever
the interests of justice might seem to demand
variation; see generally Enid
Campbell "Revocation and Variation in Administrative Decisions" <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MonashULawRw/1996/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] MonashULawRw 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2022%20Monash%20University%20Law%20Review%2030" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 22 Mon
LR 30</a> at 33-38.
<P>

8   	When, for that purpose is judgment or an order entered? A
policy of the finality of litigation underpins our system of law:
<i>Bailey v
Marinoff </i>(supra) per Gibb J at 539.  Entry of judgments or orders in the
registry of the court achieves this finality by bringing the litigation
to an
end: see<i> Holtby v Hodgson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281889%29%2024%20QBD%20103" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1889) 24 QBD 103</a> at 107;  <i>Antoniadis v
Ramsay Surgical Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1972/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1972] VicRp 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20VR%20323" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] VR 323</a>;<i> Trippe Ltd v Henderson Investments
Pty Ltd</i> (1990) 101 FLR 261. "Entering" (or "authenticating" as it sometimes
known in other jurisdictions) judgment in the case of a court
of record is the
formal process by which the judgment or orders of the court are "perfected" by
being drawn up as a record of the
court: see <i>Bailey v Marinoff</i> per
Barwick CJ at 530. The judgments and orders of courts of record are not
perfected until they have been formally passed and entered
into the court's
records (<i>R v Bellington</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1980/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] VicRp 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%20VR%20625" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] VR 625).</a> This is in contrast to a court
not of record whose judgment is perfected by the pronouncement. All judgments
of the Supreme Court
of New South Wales are required, subject to limited
exceptions, to be entered: Pt 42 r11(1) of the Supreme Court Rules ("the
Rules").
 Entry of judgment is accomplished by the registrar sealing a minute
of the judgment or order, which has been previously signed by
a registrar or
the Judge or master who made the judgement or order and filed: Pt 42 r13 of the
Rules.
<P>

9   	In earlier times judgment was entered upon the roll or
record of the court and it was that record which determined the rights
of the
parties: see Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, 1st ed
(1765-1769) Vol 3 389-395.  A judgment was not a record
of the court until it
was `made up': <i>King v Birch</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1842/778.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1842] EngR 778</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281842%29%203%20QB%20425" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1842) 3 QB 425</a> at 431<a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1842/778.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1842] EngR 778</a>; ,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=114%20ER%20569" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">114 ER 569</a> at 572;
<i>Phillips v Birch</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1842/642.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1842] EngR 642</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281842%29%204%20Man%20%26%20G%20403" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1842) 4 Man &amp; G 403</a>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=134%20ER%20165" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">134 ER 165.</a>  A distinction is
therefore made between pronouncing judgment, that is, the giving of formal
orders, and subsequently entering judgment:<i> Holtby v Hodgson</i> (supra) at
107;  <i>Driver v Driver</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/sa/SAStRp/1949/37.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1949] SAStRp 37</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1950%5d%20SASR%208" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1950] SASR 8</a> at 10; <i>Antoniadis v Ramsay
Surgical Ltd</i> (supra); <i>Trippe Ltd v Henderson Investments Pty Ltd</i>
(supra); <i>In Marriage of Moore</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20125%20FLR%20420" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 125 FLR 420.</a> 
<P>

10   	For purposes of the doctrine of res judicata, the effect
of giving judgment is said to be that "the cause of action in respect
of which
it was given is merged in the judgment and its place is taken by the rights
created by the judgment": Halsbury's Laws of
England (4th edition) Vol 26 par
551; <i>Commonwealth of Australia v Precision Pools Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2053%20FCR%20183" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 53 FCR
183</a> at 191. At the time of delivering judgment a judge is not yet <i>functus
officio</i>: <i>Cheeseman v Bowaters United Kingdom Paper Mills</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%201%20WLR%201773" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 1
WLR 1773</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%203%20All%20ER%20513" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] 3 All ER 513.</a> In <i>Driver v Driver</i> (supra) at 10 Napier
CJ said that until a judgment was entered it was "inchoate and incomplete"
having "not yet passed from the control
of the judge who pronounced it."
<P>

11   	The present case concerns the position where a judgment
has not been entered. It is governed by the common law rule as well
as Pt 40 r9
of the Rules. The latter provides that "the court may set aside or vary a
judgment where notice of motion for the setting
aside or variation is filed
before entry of judgment". This is not a case governed by the so-called "slip
rule", set out in Pt 20
r10 which provides:
<P>

"Where there is a clerical mistake, or an error arising from an accidental slip
or omission, in a minute of a judgment or order,
or in a certificate, the
Court, on the application of any party or of its own motion, may, at any time,
correct the mistake or error."
<P>

12   	Nor is this a case where judgment has been entered and
matters occur after judgment takes effect under Pt 42 r12, which provides:
<P>

"A person bound by a judgment may move the Court for a stay of execution of the
judgment, or for some other order, on the ground
of matters occurring after the
date on which the judgment takes effect and the Court may, on terms, make such
order as the nature
of the case requires."
<P>

13   	While appellate courts must have regard to whether and to
what extent there is any prospect of any final appellate review
and which in
the case of the Australian courts of appeal depends upon special High Court
leave, the principles for exercise of the
discretion as laid down in <i>Smith v
NSW Bar Association (No. 2)</i> (supra) at 265 embrace all courts:
<P>

"The power is discretionary and, although it exists up until the entry of
judgment, it is one that is exercised having regard to
the public interest in
maintaining the finality of litigation (<i>Wentworth v Woollahra Municipal
Council</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20672" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR 672</a> at 684)). Thus, if reasons for judgment have
been given, the power is only exercised if there is some matter calling for
review (<i>Marinoff v Bailey</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%2092%20WN%28NSW%29%20280" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 92 WN(NSW) 280</a> at 284; <i>National
Benzole Co Ltd v Gooch</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1961%5d%201%20WLR%201489" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1961] 1 WLR 1489</a> at 1492-1494). And there may be
more or less reluctance to exercise the power depending on whether there is an
avenue of appeal (<i>State Rail Authority of NSW v Codelfa Constructions Pty
Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/51.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20150%20CLR%2029" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 150 CLR 29</a> at 38-39, 45-46; <i>Wentworth v Rogers [No 9]</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20388" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 388</a> AT 394-395)." 
<P>

Per Brennan, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ in <i>Smith v NSW Bar Association
(No 2)</i> at 265.
<P>

Their Honours went on to say (at 265) "the power to review a judgment in a case
where the order has not been entered will not ordinarily
be exercised to permit
a general re-opening".
<P>

14   	Speaking in broad terms, the basis for review has been
expressed thus:  
<P>

"An order varying the terms of a judgment that has not been entered will be
made to correct error or oversight or to effect a review
of the contemplated
order so that the orders may be able to deal more adequately with the matter as
litigated by the parties before
the court" 
<P>

in the <i>Texas Company (Australasia) Ltd v FCT</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1940/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1940] HCA 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281940%29%2063%20CLR%20382" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1940) 63 CLR 382</a> per
Starke J at 457). In appellate courts particularly, there is to be weighed the
public interest in the finality of litigation
against what would otherwise be
irremediable injustice; <i>State Rail authority of New South Wales v Codelfa
Construction Pty Limited</i> at 38 per Mason and Wilson JJ. But that latter
factor does not have the same weight where, as here, appeal is allowed as of
right
or as a matter of usual course.
<P>

15   	The discretion to re-open or vary a judgment is thus
significantly qualified. As is so often said, the power should "be exercised
with great caution"; <i>Wentworth v Woollahra Municipal Council</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/41.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 41</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20672" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149
CLR 672</a> at 684.  Examples where re-opening was denied serve to illustrate the
constraint observed by the courts in exercise of the discretion:
<P>

(i)	Where the ground was that the Court misconstrued a section of legislation
this was said to be "an attempt to re-argue the substantial
question decided in
the appeal after hearing full argument from counsel for the parties".
<i>Wentworth v Woollahra Municipal Council</i> (supra) at 685
<P>

(ii)	Where the grounds are an allegation of bias against the Court or
allegations of mistaken findings of fact, the proper procedure
is to seek
special leave to appeal from the High Court.  <i>Wentworth v Rogers (No 9)</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20388" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 388</a> at 395
<P>

(iii)	Where what is occurring is in truth the re-agitation of arguments already
considered by the Court; as was said by Mason CJ
in <i>Autodesk</i> (at
302):
<P>

"It must be emphasised that the jurisdiction [to review or re-hear an issue] is
not to be exercised for the purposes of re-agitating
arguments already
considered by the Court; nor is it to be exercised simply because the party
seeking a re-hearing has failed to
present the argument in all its aspects or
as well as it might have been put"  
<P>

(iv)	Where the parties have been sufficiently heard on the impugned issue;
<i>Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2)</i>.
<P>

(v)	Where even if there be the possibility of some misapprehension on the
Court's part as to the facts or relevant law, this misapprehension
can be
attributed solely to the neglect or default of the party seeking the
re-hearing; for "the purpose of the jurisdiction is not
to provide a backdoor
method by which unsuccessful litigants can seek to re-argue their cases"; per
Mason CJ in <i>Autodesk</i> at 303.
<P>

16   	Examples on the other hand where review has been allowed
in the case of a judgment or order of a court of first instance include
the
following:
<P>

(i)	Where the court's reasons for judgment inadvertently did not deal with
important matters argued by counsel at the hearing where
an appeal to correct
this would involve inevitable delay;  <i>Twenty-First Australia Inc v Shade</i>
(NSWSC, Young J, 31 July 1998, unreported) in Butterworths Unreported Judgments
at 18. 
<P>

(ii)	Where the court's reasons involve "infelicity of expression and ambiguous
statements" which may be corrected by the trial judge
upon the bringing in of
short minutes; <i>Fexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/578.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 578</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2029%20ACSR%20290" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998)
29 ACSR 290.</a>
<P>

(iii)	Where re-opening in respect of an order which was consequential upon a
finding of error of law and the trial judge had no
intention that the order
have the effect that further evidence could be called on in the remittal to the
tribunal below, and where
the possible effect of the order had not been the
subject of argument at hearing;  <i>AB v Federal Commissioner of Taxation</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20157%20ALR%20510" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 157 ALR 510. (While</a> the order arising out of this decision to re-open
the matter and the previous decision which found an error of law were
overturned
on appeal in <i>Glennan v Commissioner of Taxation</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1999/297.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] FCA
297</a>, the decision to re-open was not itself canvassed in the appeal.)
<P>

(iv)	Where what was sought was further consideration of orders in respect of
the nature and extent of equitable relief which had
been earlier sought at
trial (in the context of a complex litigation);  <i>Farrow Finance Company Ltd
(in liquidation) v Farrow Properties Pty Ltd (in liquidation) and Ors</i>
(SC(Vic), Hansen J, 16 April 1998, unreported)
<P>

(v)	Where a party had misunderstood the basis of a pleading and failed to
address the issue in its strike-out application;  <i>Hoad v Nationwide News</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%2d1997%29%2037%20IPR%20407" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996-1997) 37 IPR 407</a> [Anderson J SC(WA)]
<P>

(vi)	Where excision of a paragraph from a judgment was sought where the trial
judge had mistakenly referred in his reasons to a
situation which did not
exist; <i>Smits v Buckworth (No 2)</i> (NSWSC, Young J, 14 November 1997,
unreported)
<P>

(vii)	Where the trial judge recalled his order after deciding it was wrong
immediately after making it;  <i>Pittalis v Sherefettin</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%201%20QB%20868" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 1 QB 868</a>
<P>

17   	In the Court of Appeal, where further appeal would have
depended on discretionary special leave from the High Court, the Court
agreed
to re-open its decision in order to permit a reconsideration of a particular
issue, because the court had not originally been
made aware of authority
directly in point and which was to the contrary to that earlier decision;
<i>Wentworth v Wentworth</i> (NSWCA, 30 November 1998, unreported).
<P>

18   	While illustrations of where the courts have or have not
re-opened a judgment not yet entered are of value, they can be subsumed
more
generally in what Mason CJ said in <i>Autodesk</i> (at 301-2). He delimited the
scope of the discretion by explaining that "the exceptional step" of reviewing
an issue might occur
where a court has good reason to consider that it had
proceeded on a misapprehension as to the facts or the law and where the
misapprehension
cannot be attributed solely to the applicant's neglect or
default. 
<P>

19   	Once a matter is re-opened the scope of the review depends
upon the error or omission which has led to it. Thus Brennan, Dawson,
Toohey
and Gaudron JJ in <i>Smith v NSW Bar Association (No 2)</i> at 256:
<P>

"...... once a matter has been re-opened, the nature and extent of the review
must depend on the error or omission which has led
to that step being taken.
Very little will be required in a case where, for example, all that is involved
is a mathematical error
in the calculation of some particular item of loss or
damage. And, in the case of a factual error, the extent of the review will
vary
depending on whether the error goes to the heart of the matter or whether its
significance is confined to some discrete subsidiary
issue."
<P>

<b>Grounds advanced for review of the judgment of 9 April 1999</b>
<P>

20   	Ms Wentworth submitted that the judgment of 9 April 1999
depended for its foundation upon the Court of Appeal's decision of
21 February
1996 and second, that that Court of Appeal decision of 21 February 1996 was not
only wrong but, more relevantly, should
be treated as in effect a nullity on
the basis that it in turn depended upon the assumption that Deputy Registrar
Howe's determinations
in the taxation had continued effect. The argument
proceeded that since the effect of the judgment of 6 February 1998 was to deny
the determinations of Deputy Registrar Howe any continued effect, apart from
the three interim certificates, that removed any binding
effect of the Court of
Appeal decision upon me when subsequently considering what, if any, cost orders
to make. She argued that setting
aside the taxation for apprehended bias meant
in any event that the necessary substratum for the Court of Appeal's decision
of 21
February 1996 had been removed. This, she said, rendered it necessary
that the reasons in my judgment of 9 April 1999 should be corrected
insofar as
dependent upon a Court of Appeal decision that could have no relevant binding
effect.
<P>

21   	Quite apart from the importance of a single judge in this
Court properly recognising the binding effect of decisions of courts
superior
to it in the hierarchy of courts, and in this instance the Court of Appeal, the
proposition that the Court of Appeal decision
can be treated as a nullity fails
to recognise several fundamental matters. The first is that when in my judgment
of 6 February 1998
I set aside the determinations of Deputy Registrar Howe,
this was based on a finding that those determinations were voidable rather
than
void, thus leaving the effect of their subsequent avoidance to be considered.
Thus at page 57 the judgment concludes: 
<P>

"Finally it should be emphasised that if, as is well settled, bias is capable
of waiver, then it must follow that a decision vitiated
by bias is voidable
rather than void.  This leaves open the possibility of severance, in which so
much of the decision and its consequences
as are properly capable of severance
may be severed."
<P>

22   	That indeed was the basis for the determination, strongly
pressed by Ms Wentworth, that the interim certificates could be
severed from
the certificates which were given after the hearing. Indeed there is Privy
Council authority that a decision by an association
which was vitiated or
invalidated by a denial of natural justice, retained sufficient existence in
law to be the subject of a valid
appeal to a committee of that association not
rendered nugatory by the later setting aside of the association's decision;
<i>Calvin v Carr</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 NSWLR 1</a> at 8 and see also <i>Wilde v Australian
Trade Equipment Co Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20145%20CLR%20590" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 145 CLR 590</a> at 595 and <i>MacFoy v United

<P>

23   	Similarly, in <i>Forbes v Trotting Club (NSW)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1979/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1979] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%20143%20CLR%20242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979)
143 CLR 242</a>, where the issue was the validity of the Club's resolution to
exclude the Plaintiff from all trotting venues in the State, including
those
which the Club did not own, Aickin J at 277 explained the position in terms
which I adopt:
<P>

"This argument appears to me to involve a misconception. That which is done
without compliance with applicable principles of natural
justice, in
circumstances where the relevant authority is obliged to comply with such
principles, is not to be regarded as void <i>ab initio</i> so that what
purports to be an act done is totally ineffective for all purposes. Such an act
is valid and operative unless and until
duly challenged but upon such challenge
being upheld it is void, not merely from the time of a decision that effect by
a court, but
from its inception. Thus although it is merely voidable, when it
is declared to be contrary to natural justice the consequence is
that it is
deemed to have been void <i>ab initio</i>. Accordingly, it does not follow from
the fact that an act is done without compliance with the principles of natural
justice that
it must be regarded as no act at all and supportable (if at all)
as an effective act only on some other basis."
<P>

24   	Thus accepting the effect of my judgment on 6 February
1998 was to render void the determinations of Taxing Officer Howe and
accepting
also that these were rendered void <i>ab initio</i>, that voidance necessarily
post-dated the judgment of the Court of Appeal of 21 February 1996. There could
be no suggestion that
those Court of Appeal proceedings were in any fashion
irregular by reason of events that subsequently occurred by virtue of my
review.
Accepting that the decision of the Court of Appeal was regular at the
time it was handed down, it cannot be rendered a nullity merely
because the
determinations with which it was concerned have since been set aside in
collateral proceedings. Thus by analogy a later
setting aside of orders will
not automatically render an earlier judgment a nullity. And quite apart from
those considerations, an
appellate judgment does not lose any precedential
value, though the earlier overruled decision has no further effect. There must
be many cases in the law reports in which the orders propounded were later set
aside by agreement of the parties in settlement of
an appeal. It has never been
suggested that later courts are thereby precluded from relying upon the
reasoning of those earlier decisions,
whether or not bound by it. 
<P>

25   	Nor, in the present case, could the logical substratum of
the Court of Appeal's judgment be properly treated as so altered
(by avoidance
of Deputy Registrar Howe's determination) as to be no longer binding, for
reasons which I explain below. In essence,
that reasoning was to preclude
recovery of costs in challenging Deputy Registrar Howe's determination, prior
to his completing any
reconsideration. This was on the basis that such
challenge was not pursuant to the Court's supervisory jurisdiction but
necessarily
under the Rules, which had been disregarded. Even if it should
later transpire that the determination was void <i>ab initio</i>, it does not
follow that premature applications so characterised could give rise now to cost
orders, contrary to the Court of Appeal's
decision that, in essence, costs
should lie where they fall. I elaborate below on the steps to that result by
reference to the Court
of Appeal's reasoning as relied on in my judgment of 9
April 1999
<P>

26   	In my judgment of 9 April 1999 reference is made directly
to the Court of Appeal decision of 21 February 1996 firstly at para
9. In that
paragraph, I quoted from my earlier judgment of 6 February 1998. The reference
was in these terms:
<P>

"Finally the Plaintiff seeks cost orders against the Defendant and in
particular an order that the Defendant pay the costs of the
Plaintiff of the
whole of the taxation process to date including the costs of all applications
which have arisen to date from the
entire failure of the taxation process, on
an indemnity basis.  In my judgment no such orders should be made.  The
Defendant has
it is true put the Plaintiff to proof regarding the matter of
bias, but the Defendant was entitled to do this.  The Plaintiff would
be put to
proof in any event whether the Defendant had played a role or not in the
initial stages of the present proceedings.  It
would be wholly inappropriate
for cost orders to be made against the Defendant in the circumstances.
Moreover  the Defendant was
entitled to contest the Plaintiff's contentions
before the Taxing Officer, though it is to be regretted that the proceedings
overall
were contested by both parties in so unconstrained a way.  However it
is not possible to attribute a preponderance of responsibility
for this to
either party.  All of this has, as Clarke JA observed (Wentworth v Wentworth at
36) "meant that the court, and officers
of the court, have been required to
spend an excessive amount of court time in resolving one incidental aspect of
litigation between
two people."  That said, I do not detract from the
Plaintiff's right to have this aspect of the Taxing Officer's determinations
dealt
with by this Court."
<P>

27   	Then at paras 18-20 there is stated the self-evident
proposition that a single judge of this Court could not add to or vary
any cost
order made by the Court of Appeal and in particular that on 21 February 1996.
Then at paras 19-20 it is said:
<P>

"The remaining non-review costs, namely those in respect of the appearances
before Deputy Registrar Howe and costs incidental thereto,
arise for
consideration in the exercise of this Court's supervisory jurisdiction over its
own officers. The present proceedings cannot,
as I say in my earlier judgment
of 6 February 1998, be in any sense a review within the Rules nor an appeal.
Rather they arise under
the inherent power of this Court to review a taxing
officer's decision "for the Court always retains to itself power to supervise
and control the authority which it delegates to its Taxing Officers ......";
see <i>Wentworth v Wentworth</i> (NSWCA, 21 February 1996, unreported) per
Clarke JA at 8 cited at page 24 of my judgment of 6 February 1998.
<P>

Dealing with the items comprised in the non-review costs that did not involve
appearances before the Court of Appeal, it is clear
from the Court of Appeal
judgment, in particular Clarke JA's criticism that Miss Wentworth embarked on
that attack before the Master
without first seeking a reconsideration of the
taxation before the Taxing Officer, that the Court of Appeal not only did not
but
would not have awarded any costs in relation to those applications
comprised in the collateral attack; see Clarke JA at 10 quoted
at page 17 of my
judgment of 6 February 1998. I see no basis for my doing otherwise."
<P>

28   	That in turn led to the conclusion of that judgment
reached at para 65 which I quote below:
<P>

"In all the circumstances, I consider that the proper cost order to be made is
that the Defendant should pay the Plaintiff's review
costs on a party and party
basis up to but not after 15 July 1997 when the Defendant took no further part
in the proceedings. So
far as earlier costs of the taxation are concerned, not
attributable to the Court of Appeal or otherwise in conflict with its orders
and thus not including any collateral attack as described in paras 18 and 20 of
this judgment, I would give leave for either party
to make application in
relation to such costs, but only after the completion of the further assessment
pursuant to regulation 80,
as elaborated in paras 66 to 68 of this
judgment."
<P>

29   	What then are the earlier costs of the taxation, "not
attributable to the Court of Appeal or otherwise in conflict with its
orders
and thus not including any collateral attack as described in paras 18 and 20 of
this judgment?" The answer to that question
is clear enough from a reading of
the judgment of Clarke JA of 21 February 1996. Essentially his judgment and the
reasoning upon
which it depends made clear that the two appeals to the Court of
Appeal, namely that of Ms Wentworth and of Mr Peter Wentworth by
way of
cross-appeal, should have "no order as to costs". That clearly means that a
judicial decision has been made that there should
be no costs ordered to either
side and that necessarily means that costs are to lie where they fall; see
<i>Re Hodgkinson</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1895%5d%202%20Ch%20190" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1895] 2 Ch 190</a> followed by Taylor J in <i>Trikas v Rheem
(Australia) Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%2081%20WN%20504" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] 81 WN 504</a> at 506 and more recently
<i>Oshlack v Richmond River Council</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%20193%20CLR%2072" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 193 CLR 72</a> at 91 per Gaudron and
Gummow JJ describing the effect of such an order in those terms. Clearly enough
that order is not to be construed
as if the Court of Appeal had said nothing at
all as to costs. Rather, as the High Court explains, the effect of its order is
that,
costs are to lie where they fall. That has the result that if a
subsequent lower court were to order otherwise, that would impermissibly
interfere with an order binding upon that lower court -- in this case upon
myself as a single judge.
<P>

30   	That same reasoning led also to conclusions of Clarke JA
which can be summarised in these terms. There was to be no recovery
of any
costs of proceedings before Master McLaughlin where the Master either lacked
jurisdiction or should have refrained from exercising
jurisdiction. There was
no jurisdiction properly exercisable because those proceedings were to
challenge decisions made during and
as part of a taxation and which would
ultimately be reflected in the later final decision and certificate of
taxation. Such proceedings
were only capable of being brought under the
applicable Supreme Court rules <i>after</i> any re-consideration by the Master
was completed. Clarke JA was clearly referring to the proceedings which
"involved 18 days of hearing
before Master McLaughlin between 11 February 1994
and 11 August 1994 that is, before the conclusion of the reconsideration" and
which
"resulted in at least ten published reasons for judgment which were
characterised by the Master as directions to the Taxing Officer"
(Clarke JA at
3). The basis for that conclusion is made clear in his summation at page 10:
<P>

"As I have sought to point out there is a simple and orderly procedure for the
taxation of costs and the reconsideration and review
of any taxation. That
procedure does not include any provision for the challenging of decisions made
during, and as part of, a taxation
which would ultimately be reflected in the
final decision and certificate of taxation. Where a party complains that a
decision announced
during the course of the taxation is wrong it is not open to
it under the rules to challenge that decision. On the contrary it is
required
by the rules to await the conclusion of the taxation and then to seek a
reconsideration of the taxation. It is only in that
way that, the inherent
jurisdiction apart, it can challenge the determination.
<P>

KW did not do this. Instead she filed a number of pointless applications all of
which should, in my opinion have been summarily
dismissed by the Master.
Unfortunately, the Master initially appears to have entertained them although
in his reasons of 16 December
1994 the Master indicated that some of the
questions with which he was dealing were also relevant to a review although he
had not
identified a notice of motion seeking a review of the decision or the
reconsideration.
<P>

31   	However, I should also refer to a particular passage at
page 8 of the Court of Appeal decision of 21 February 1996 where Clarke
JA
assumes that none of these proceedings brought prematurely were made by way of
appeal or review pursuant to the Court's inherent
power to supervise and
control the authority delegated to taxing officers:
<P>

"I should also mention in passing that the rules do not detract from the
inherent power of the court (that is the judges) to review
a Taxing Officer's
decision for the Court always retains to itself power to supervise and control
the authority which it delegates
to its Taxing Officers. (see <i>Garrard v
Email Furniture Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2032%20NSWLR%20662" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 32 NSWLR 662</a> at 680-1; <i>Cockatoo Dockyard
Pty Ltd v Atamain</i> (New South Wales Court of Appeal, 11 August 1995,
unreported). Having regard to the detailed procedures in Division 7 of Part 52
of the Supreme Court Rules the occasions for the exercise of the inherent power
could be expected to be rare. In the present case
it can safely be put to one
side as both the Taxing Officer and the Master were exercising their functions
pursuant to the power
contained in the rules and no appeal was made to the
inherent power of the court."
<P>

32   	Ms Wentworth submitted that in fact certain of the
proceedings before the Master could in effect be characterised as an attempt
to
invoke the court's power to supervise and control the authority which it
delegates to its Taxing Officers, in that one of the
many applications dealt
with was directed to attempting to have Deputy Registrar Howe complete the
taxation without further delay
and another was to get him to issue an interim
certificate, in circumstances where there had been undue delay. (Her earlier
bias
application was not able to be dealt with until I dealt with it, despite
strenuous effort by Ms Wentworth to have it dealt with earlier.)
Clarke JA,
however, in the passage earlier quoted proceeds on the basis that "no appeal
was made to the inherent power of the court"
by way of supervision. But in any
event, it is only for the Court of Appeal, should it entertain any such
application, to make any
order to permit recovery in any such cases, if
persuaded to do so, not for me as a trial judge. Ms Wentworth may seek to have
the
Court of Appeal review its decision or make further orders, in regard to
such instances, this being in circumstances where Deputy
Registrar's
determinations have been later set aside under the court's supervisory
jurisdiction. What is clear is that I cannot pre-empt
what the Court of Appeal
may do. As the judgment of 9 April 1999 makes clear (at para 65), the effect of
my anticipated orders is
that I would give leave for either party to make
application in relation to earlier costs of the taxation -- that is to say,
non-review
costs -- but only <i>after</i> completion of the further assessment
pursuant to Regulation 80 of the Legal Profession Regulations 1994, as that may
bear upon the
outcome. Thus any application to the Court of Appeal at this
point, when no such assessment has yet taken place, may in any event
be
premature even if it were to be entertained, though that is for the Court of
Appeal to determine if and when any such application
is made.
<P>

<b>Summing Up</b>
<P>

33   	To sum up: re-consideration by Deputy Registrar Howe was
only completed on 16 August 1994. The decision of the Court of Appeal
delivered
on 21 February 1996 remains binding upon me. Its reasoning is not negated by
the avoidance, though <i>ab initio</i>, of the taxation (save for the interim
certificates). Still applicable and binding upon me are the observations of the
Court of Appeal
concerning the Plaintiff's failure to wait for any challenge to
the taxation till reconsideration was completed by the taxing officer.
I am
likewise bound by the Court of Appeal's formal order that there be no order as
to costs in relation, inter alia, to those premature
proceedings
pre-reconsideration. They must lie where they fall. It is true that the Court
of Appeal concluded that none of such challenges
were based on the inherent
supervisory power. In the event that the Court of Appeal were willing to review
its earlier finding in
that regard and if it were then to determine that any
such challenge involved, albeit exceptionally, one or more applications
properly
to be understood as invoking the inherent jurisdiction to supervise
and control the authority which it delegates to its Taxing Officers,
that would
be a matter for the Court of Appeal. It may (or may not) countenance any such
application and if countenanced may nonetheless
consider that any such
application should only follow <i>after</i> the fresh assessment of costs,
which has yet to take place. Certainly my orders and earlier judgment of 9
April 1999 envisage that
any application for costs attributable to the taxation
be only made after that fresh assessment, so that the implications of what
emerges from the assessment can be taken into account.
<P>

<b>REMAINING MATTERS</b>
<P>

34   	Ms Wentworth then again contends that Mr Howe as Deputy
Registrar and Taxing Officer is in an administrative position and
cannot
attract judicial immunity, contrary to the decision that I reached in my
judgment of 9 April 1999. However, as was said in
<i>Autodesk</i> by Mason CJ
at 302: 
<P>

"It must be emphasised that the jurisdiction [to review or re-hear an issue] is
not to be exercised for the purpose of re-agitating
arguments already
considered by the court; nor is it to be exercised simply because the party
seeking a re-hearing has failed to
present the argument in all its aspects as
well as it might have been put."
<P>

I am satisfied that this issue is clearly not one which should be reopened; it
is a matter for appeal, not review. There is nothing
in the Court of Appeal's
subsequent decision in <i>Attorney-General v Kennedy Miller</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/158.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCA
158</a> which requires me, applying the relevant principles, to re-open this issue.
This is where the Court of Appeal (at para 7) refers
to the position of cost
assessors being analogous to referees, who as a matter of policy are "to be
accorded immunity from cost orders".
They added the proviso upon which Ms
Wentworth relies "that this will not necessarily be so in cases where
misconduct or lack of
good faith is shown". That issue was dealt with so far as
relevant in the detailed reasoning of my judgment. 
<P>

35   	In a similar category is Ms Wentworth's contention that
for the Court not to order costs in favour of the Plaintiff as claimed
for the
taxation, re-consideration and review, including all the costs of the
applications 
<P>

"necessitated before the Master by the misbehaviour of T/O Howe, supported,
aided and abetted by the Defendant and his legal representatives
would be
grossly unfair" 
<P>

and that 
<P>

"the result of the new assessment is irrelevant to the determination of the
costs incurred to date, and any such material would
be inadmissible in
determining the costs occasioned by T/O Howe's bias."
<P>

36   	That submission is elaborated in para 4 of Ms Wentworth's
written submissions of 5 May 1999 as well as in oral argument and
again in her
Reply. 
<P>

37   	These are all matters which have been argued before me.
They are clearly not matters which warrant the exceptional course
of re-opening
my judgment under the principles that I have earlier set out. The same
observation applies to Ms Wentworth's submissions
relating to the non-review
costs generally.
<P>

38   	Finally, I note that Hunter J, in a judgment of 7 June
1999 and a further addendum of 9 June 1999, dealt with two subpoenas
of Ms
Wentworth. Ms Wentworth concurred in the course of another judge thus dealing
with that matter, so that I would not see the
subpoenaed material if the
subpoena were set aside. He concluded that the relevant material sought to be
subpoenaed was not relevant.
For that purpose he inspected that material. He
too was then asked to re-open his judgment upon Ms Wentworth's application.
Hunter
J declined that application; see the addendum.
<P>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>

39   	I intend now to make the orders essentially as set out in
the draft attached to this judgment. Before finalising these orders
I will give
a final brief opportunity to consider them. I emphasise that any such
consideration is not to amount to a re-agitation
of the issues already
determined and now again revisited. The present application to re-open was not
justified under the principles
I have earlier set out, involving as it has done
the reagitation of issues already determined. The Court time thus expended
involves
no cost consequences to the Plaintiff, vis a vis the Defendant, as the
Defendant has played no role in this phase of the proceedings.
Court resources
are limited and depend upon the parties respecting the need for finality in
litigation. I am certainly not unaware
or insensitive to the frustration Ms
Wentworth understandably feels at earlier delay in finalising the taxation. But
it lies now
substantially in her hands how rapidly this is progressed.
<P>
