<b><u>3280/98 DONNA LEIGH v WROTHWELL GARTH WALL- ESTATE OF CLIFFORD McRAE
COLLINS</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  In this matter, the plaintiff, who is the administrator with the
will annexed of the estate of Clifford McRae Collins,
seeks an order that the
defendant take action and sign whatever documents are necessary to effect the
release of a Chopard watch,
being an asset in the estate of the deceased, from
the custody of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to her.
<P>

2	Mr Collins died on 28 May 1996.  He made a will dated 30 January 1995, under
which he appointed Mr Bruno Kortenhorst executor,
and gave the whole of his
estate to the plaintiff, Donna Leigh.
<P>

3	The deceased died as a result of an aeroplane accident, he being the pilot of
the plane.  Mr Kortenhorst was a passenger in that
plane, and was quite
seriously injured in the crash.  He has now brought proceedings in the District
Court of New South Wales against
the plaintiff as administrator, for damages
for the injuries which he sustained in the action.
<P>

4	On the evidence before the court, that claim, if it is successful, would
result in a substantial judgment for damages against
the estate.
<P>

5	The letters of administration document includes, as is normal, an inventory
of property.  This shows that the assets of the plaintiff
separately owned are
estimated to have a value of $115,000, the watch comprising $100,000 of that
figure.
<P>

6	There were apparently some other shares which may have been held with other
persons as joint tenants, but that is not clear.
<P>

7	There was correspondence between the solicitors for the plaintiff beneficiary
over a considerable period with the solicitor for
Mr Kortenhorst, some of which
made inappropriate demands for property to be delivered to the plaintiff.
<P>

8	In some of that correspondence a suggestion was made that it would be
inappropriate for Mr Kortenhorst to apply for probate of
the will of the
deceased, because he might wish to make a claim against the estate,
particularly as it appears there is likely to
be some question as to whether or
not the deceased was covered by appropriate insurance in respect of a claim for
negligence against
him or his estate.
<P>

9	Whether for this reason or not, by document dated 2  September 1996, Mr
Kortenhorst renounced probate of the will, although his
solicitors did not
inform the solicitors for the plaintiff of this for some time, and wrote a
letter on 8 October 1996 which on its
face was misleading.
<P>

10	The plaintiff obtained a grant of letters of administration with the will
annexed on 24 December 1996.  She thus became entitled
to call for and get in
the whole of the estate of the deceased.
<P>

11	A short time prior to obtaining that grant, an agreement was reached between
the solicitors that the watch would be placed in
a safe deposit box at the
Commonwealth Bank, Mullumbimby in the names of Mr Wall and Mr Sochakwi, the two
solicitors, as co-trustees
pending the resolution of the estate matter(s).  The
watch was deposited, it seems, in accordance with that agreement on 20 December
1996, namely four days before the grant of administration.
<P>

12	There was then some further correspondence between the solicitors about the
watch being taken from that safety deposit box with
the Commonwealth Bank and
delivered into the possession of the plaintiff or her solicitor.
<P>

13	The defendant, Mr Wall, has refused to sign the documents necessary to
enable the bank to release the watch, apparently on the
basis that he is acting
for Mr Kortenhorst in his claim for personal injuries, and one can assume is
concerned that if the watch
is handed to the plaintiff, the proceeds of its
sale, if it is sold, may not be available to meet the amount of any judgment
which
his client, Mr Kortenhorst, obtains against the estate.
<P>

14	Mr Sochakwi has had correspondence with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia,
in essence demanding that it hand the watch to him,
presumably on authority
from Donna Leigh.  However, the bank obviously will not do so without
instructions from Mr Wall, as that
is the condition of the deposit with the
bank.
<P>

15	One might get the impression from the letter to the bank of 7 February 1997,
that it was intended the property be transferred
to the plaintiff, but I do not
think it should be thought that letter meant that the plaintiff was to treat
the watch as if it was
her property. In fact the most recent letter of 4 June
1998 from Mr Sochakwi to Mr Wall makes it perfectly clear I think that that
was
never the intention, and certainly is not now the intention.
<P>

16	Whatever the position, before the grant of letters of administration, there
can be no doubt that upon that grant being obtained,
the plaintiff was entitled
to take possession of all estate property, and was bound to do so.  Not only
that, she was bound to deal
with it as administrator, in due course of
administration.
<P>

17	There was no basis on which the watch could have just been left in the bank
not under the control of the administrator, or in
my view there was no
agreement that that would happen, and that the letter relied upon by Mr Wall
was an agreement that the watch
was to stay in the bank, pending the estate
being put in a position for final distribution.
<P>

18	Any such agreement would, as a matter of interest, make Mr Wall susceptible
to some claim by persons who had proper claims against
the estate.  Thus, in my
view it is clear that  the plaintiff is entitled to the order against Mr Wall
that he execute documents
authorising the release to the plaintiff of the
watch.
<P>

19	It has been put by Mr Gruzman that this ought not to be done, because there
is some danger that the plaintiff will not deal with
that watch in accordance
with her duties as administrator.  There is no evidence before the court to
show that to be the position.
<P>

20	Thus, there would be no basis for any order in the nature of a Mareva
Injunction, if such an order were sought, which I should
make clear has not
been sought.
<P>

21	The other relief which the plaintiff seeks in the summons is a declaration
that the defendant holds the watch in trust for her.
 That is not an
appropriate declaration to make, because the plaintiff's solicitor, as well as
the defendant, hold the watch in trust
for her as administrator. If the parties
wish that declaration to be made now, I would be prepared to consider it.
However, on the
face of the matter, that does not seem to be necessary.
<P>

22	I order the defendant to execute and deliver to the plaintiff or her
solicitor, all documents and authority to enable the Chopard
watch, now
deposited in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia at Mullumbimby, and held upon
the joint instructions of Mr Sochakwi and
Mr Wall to be delivered to the
plaintiff as administrator with the will annexed of the estate of Clifford
McRae Collins, deceased.
<P>

23	The costs are to follow the event.  I order the defendant to pay the
plaintiff's costs.
<P>
