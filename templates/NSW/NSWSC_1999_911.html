MASTER MALPASS
<P>

THURSDAY 9 SEPTEMBER 1999
<P>

<u>11991/1998</u>	<u>NORA ABDULBAKI v SOUTH WESTERN SYDNEY AREA HEALTH
SERVICE</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	These proceedings were commenced by Summons filed on 17 August
1998.  The plaintiff seeks inter alia relief under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151d.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 151D</a> (2) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers
Compensation Act 1987</a> (the Act).
<P>

2  	The hearing took place on 26 August 1999.  In support of the
application, the plaintiff relied on affidavits sworn by both herself
and her
solicitors.  She was cross-examined.  She tendered documentary material.  The
defendant did not adduce any evidence.
<P>

3  	In 1987, the plaintiff commenced employment at Lidcombe Hospital
as a catering assistant (in the kitchen area).  Whilst carrying
out her work
duties she suffered injury on 30 October 1994.  She slipped on a wet floor and
sustained injuries (inter alia to her
neck, lower back, right shoulder and
right arm).  Subsequently, she also suffered from referred pain in the right
arm and the right
leg.  Material relating to her medical condition (including a
number of reports) may be found in the affidavits.  For the purposes
of this
judgment, it is not necessary to recount the detail of that material.
<P>

4  	She has said that she fell in an area adjacent to the washing up
area in the kitchen.  She has said that there was quite a bit
of water and soap
on the floor.  She has also said that a rubber mat had been removed from the
floor area and had not been replaced
at the time of the incident.
<P>

5  	On or about 1 November 1994, an Accident/Incident Reporting Form
was completed and a claim for compensation was made to the
insurer of the
employer.  Initially, she had some time off from work.  Attempts were made to
return to work on light duties.  She
was paid worker's compensation benefits.
She ceased work altogether in April or May 1995.  She has not worked since that
date.  Her
employment has been terminated.  She continues to receive worker's
compensation payments.  As at October 1998, the total gross compensation
payments were $133,779.
<P>

6  	She initially saw her solicitor on or about 1 May 1995.  In one
of her affidavits, she deposes to the following:-
<P>

"I was advised by my solicitor that when my condition stabilised and doctors
were able to assess levels of permanent disability
and impairment and loss of
use, I may be entitled to claim benefits under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act</a>
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 66</a> and Section 67.  I was also advised that the
circumstances of my accident may have involved negligence on the part of my
employer
but that no decision could be made with regard or to whether or not to
commence proceedings until my condition had stabilised and
whether or not I
decided to have further operative treatment in the near future."
<P>

Subsequently, there have been further attendances upon the solicitor (including
on 20 October 1997).
<P>

7  	The relevant limitation period expired on 30 October 1997.  The
plaintiff seeks leave to commence proceedings in this Court.
 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151d.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 151D</a> (2)
confers a discretionary power to grant such leave.  The discretionary power is
exercised having regard to the relevant circumstances
of the particular case
and so that justice is best served between the parties.  The plaintiff bears
the onus of satisfying the court
of an entitlement to relief.
<P>

8  	Broadly speaking, three discretionary considerations have been
agitated.  These may be identified as delay, explanation for
delay, and
prejudice.
<P>

9  	The work incident took place almost five years ago.  It is not
said by the plaintiff that she was unaware of the limitation
period.  It would
seem that it was simply allowed to expire.  At the time of its expiration, her
solicitors had been acting for more
than two years.
<P>

10  	In substance, the explanation is that a decision on the question
of whether or not common law proceedings for damages should
be commenced was
deferred until her condition had stabilised.  The evidence throws up some
uncertainty as to when it is said that
her condition had stabilised.  There is
evidence which suggests that this may not have been until about late 1997 or
early 1998.
 There is little in the other material to corroborate that
evidence.  What it was that triggered the bringing of these proceedings
is left
somewhat unclear.
<P>

11  	The proceedings were not commenced until 17 August 1998.  They
did not come on for hearing until 26 August 1999.  Largely,
the inactivity
since late 1997 or early 1998 is really left unexplained.  The material offered
to explain delay falls short of being
satisfactory.
<P>

12  	The court has been left with the impression that the prosecution
of the application for leave has been somewhat casual.  A
special fixture was
given on 16 June 1999.  Although the court was then told that the proceedings
were ready for hearing, this does
not really seem to have been the case.  A
Subpoena for Production of Documents had been served upon the NSW Treasury
Managed Fund
on 3 December 1998.  It appears that there had been a lack of
action in pursuing the production of those documents until the matter
was
raised during the hearing of this case (when a call was made on the
subpoena).
<P>

13  	After the completion of the evidence and the making of the
defendant's submissions, application was made on behalf of the plaintiff
for
leave to re-open.  The purpose of the application was inter alia to enable the
tender of two witness statements.  Both statements
were referred to in the
affidavit evidence and objection was successfully taken in relation to comment
on their content.  Following
that evidentiary ruling, a tactical decision was
taken not to tender the statements.  The application for leave to re-open for
this
purpose was refused.
<P>

14  	There is authority for the proposition that leave is not usually
given in such circumstances.  If leave had been given, it
may have lead to
further delay and other prejudice.
<P>

15  	The defendant contends that there is both actual and general
prejudice.  It is said that it lies both in the areas of liability
and quantum.
In respect of liability, it is said that she has belatedly raised matters such
as the presence of water and soap upon
the floor which may have inter alia come
from the adjacent kitchen area and the removal of a rubber mat from the floor
area prior
to the accident.  There was reference to the witness statements
(which at that time the plaintiff had not sought to put into evidence).
 In
respect of quantum, it is said that there has been a belated raising of
symptomatology to the right wrist and head.
<P>

16  	The defendant has had the opportunity to investigate the
accident.  It can be expected that at least some investigation has
taken place.
The defendant continues to pay compensation.  There is material (adduced on the
plaintiff's behalf) that a supervisor
was at the scene of the incident shortly
after it took place. The defendant has not adduced any evidence of prejudice.
The plaintiff's
evidence suggests that there were a number of witnesses.  Two
witnesses have given statements to the plaintiff's solicitors.  The
plaintiff
has offered to make these statements available if leave is given.  There is
evidence that both of these witnesses are available
to give evidence.  There is
no evidence of unavailability of relevant witnesses.  There is no evidence of
loss of relevant records.
<P>

17  	The defendant has had the opportunity to have the plaintiff
medically examined by its own experts.  There is material which
indicates that
there has been some exercise of that opportunity.  There is material which
suggests that the defendant may have been
given a copy of at least some of the
reports prepared by her own experts.
<P>

18  	I should perhaps make one specific reference to the question
concerning the right wrist.  The material suggests that the defendant
would
have been aware of this problem by 1995.  Surgery had been recommended by Dr
Bokor and liability for that surgery was refused
by the insurer.
<P>

19  	I have given weight to the matters of the delay and the
deficiencies in the material offered to explain that delay.  Whilst
there may
be general prejudice, I am not satisfied that there is actual prejudice in any
real sense.  If liability is established,
the plaintiff's claim may be
productive of substantial damages.
<P>

20  	In the relevant circumstances of this case, I have ultimately
reached the view (after some considerable deliberation) that
justice is best
served between the parties if leave is given.
<P>

21  	I do have some reservations as to this Court being the
appropriate jurisdiction for the commencement of the proceedings.  However,
as
this has not been raised as an issue during the hearing, I put it aside for
present purposes.
<P>

22  	I grant leave to the plaintiff to commence proceedings in this
Court.  The proceedings are to be commenced by Statement of
Claim filed on or
before 23 September 1999.
<P>

23  	The plaintiff is seeking an indulgence.  In the circumstances of
this case, it was reasonable for the defendant to defend the
Summons.
Accordingly, I order the plaintiff to pay the costs of the Summons.
<P>

24  	The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
