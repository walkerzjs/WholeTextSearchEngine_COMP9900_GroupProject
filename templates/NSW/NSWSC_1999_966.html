Friday 6 August 1999 - ex tempore
<P>

Revised 21 September 1999
<P>

<b>55013/98  -  A Nolasco Pty Ltd v Richard Elliot Green</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  In this matter a judgment was handed down on
12 July 1999 ex tempore and in its revised form, dated 2 August 1999,
clearly
sets out the reasons for the making, by the Court on 9 July 1999, of the six
orders made on that day and the making on 12
July 1999 of the further order
made on that day.
<P>

2   	There is before the Court a notice of motion filed this
morning in which the plaintiff in the proceedings, as applicant, seeks
orders
that the motion be returnable instanter, that the date 9 August 1999 in order 2
of the orders made on 9 July 1999 have substituted
for it the date 16 August
1999, and for the plaintiff to pay the costs of the defendant of the motion.
<P>

3   	The motion is supported by two affidavits.  The first is
that of Mr Daniel John Massey, solicitor, of Coudert Brothers, made
on 6 August
1999 and the second is an affidavit made by Mr Arides Nolasco on 6 August
1999.
<P>

4   	Mr Massey appears on behalf of the plaintiff/applicant and
Mr Kerr of counsel appears on behalf of the defendant.  The notice
of motion is
opposed.
<P>

5   	The Court has been informed by Mr Kerr from the bar table
that the first notice of motion was received by his instructing solicitor
on
Thursday 5 August during the late afternoon.  Mr Kerr has informed the Court,
from the bar table, that the first time that the
material sought to be relied
upon, that is to say, the notice of motion and the two affidavits, were sighted
or furnished to the
defendant, was during the session of court this morning,
this date being a date on which there has been a Commercial List directions
hearing as well as a Construction List directions hearing and the day being a
motions day in both those lists as well.
<P>

6   	The defendant has not filed any evidence in response to the
motion.
<P>

7   	The affidavit of Mr Massey constitutes evidence of
preparation by him since 9 July 1999 and evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs.
The detailed preparations of that evidence are set out in paragraph 5 and
following in the affidavit and Mr Massey deposes that he
is presently preparing
a detailed affidavit for Mr Nolasco, who is the principal of the plaintiff.
That statement presently numbers
over 30 pages and will apparently include a
substantial number of annexures and exhibits.  It is 60 per cent complete and
will be
completed by 20 August 1999.
<P>

8   	Mr Massey further deposes that he has met with Mr Gary
Colla, the plaintiff's site foreman and is drafting a statement and
affidavit
on behalf of Mr Colla which is 50 per cent complete and will be filed on 20
August 1999.
<P>

9   	Mr Massey also deposes that he is in the state of
preparation of an affidavit to be made by Mr Ivison, the project manager
retained by the plaintiff company, which is either 70 per cent complete and
will be completed and filed on 20 August 1999.
<P>

10   	He also deposes that he has continued to retain the
services of Mr Zakos, who is preparing a lengthy report dealing with a
number
of matters, which is over 50 per cent complete, as Mr Zakos has informed Mr
Massey, and to be ready for filing on 20 August
1999.
<P>

11   	Mr Massey also deposes that he is meeting next week with
Messrs Mackay and Noon, who were formerly employed by the plaintiff
company,
and he was preparing affidavits on their behalf;  also that he will, next week,
be taking an affidavit from the principal
of MAC Electrics, one of the
subcontractors on the project.
<P>

12   	He also deposes that on 20 July 1999 his employed
solicitor, Miss Bailey, Mr Zakos and Mr Colla attended the site at Terry
Hills
for three hours.
<P>

13   	He also deposes that he has retained a consultant, Mr
Blumer, of Hinds Blunden Consultants, to prepare a report which deals
with the
real costs incurred by the plaintiff in relation to the project and to issues
concerning loss of profit and on site overheads.
<P>

14   	Mr Massey also deposes that he believes that the plaintiff
will be in a position to serve its evidence on 20 August 1999 in
accordance
with the orders of the Court.
<P>

15   	Mr Massey is an officer of the Court and each of the
matters to which he deposes is accepted by the Court as matters of fact,
proving the steps which Mr Massey indicates have been taken by way of
preparation of evidence on behalf of the plaintiff since July
1999.
<P>

16   	The second affidavit, that by Mr Nolasco is annexed to
this judgment.
<P>

17   	To my mind, the application in the notice of motion should
be refused for a number of reasons.
<P>

18   	I am not satisfied that there is any reasonable basis to
infer that Mr Nolasco is likely to obtain the financial accommodation
to which
he refers in his affidavit during the time frame which he anticipates nor
generally.
<P>

19   	I am not satisfied that Mr Nolasco has approached the
significance of the orders made on 9 and 12 July 1999 in terms of the
security
for costs obligations, cognizant of the seriousness of those orders and of the
significance of the obligation to comply
with those orders.
<P>

20   	The affidavit sought to be relied upon in a number of
respects is an affidavit in respect of which Mr Nolasco deposes to material
on
information and belief.  It appears, from the affidavit, that Mr Nolasco has
approached the question of raising the requisite
bank guarantee by way of
security by approaching a number of persons.  He does not state when it was
that he approached Mr Scott
Gant of Saxby Bridge, his financier.  He does not
state the dates or times when he commenced discussions with his colleague and
business
associate, Lindsay Allsop.  He does not give the dates or times when
he retained Mr Foley to negotiate with Mr Allsop and Mr Neville,
with a view to
raising $150,000.
<P>

21   	The first information of specificity that one can glean
from the affidavit as to these approaches is the statement in paragraph
10 of
the affidavit, that on Wednesday 4 August he made an application to Mr Samson
of Lumley Finance for a loan of $90,000.
<P>

22   	All things considered, and bearing in mind the orders
which were made on 9 and 12 July, making an application for a loan on
the
Wednesday before the Monday 9 August 1999, by which date the bank guarantee for
$80,000 was to be required, even in the circumstances
earlier referred to in
the affidavit, appears to be leaving the matter extremely late.
<P>

23   	I further take into consideration the failure of Mr
Nolasco or the plaintiff to furnish, by way of evidence on the application,
any
material from any of the sources of finance to whom Mr Nolasco has apparently
applied.
<P>

24   	I further take into account the extreme lateness in the
application pressed by the motion.  It would have been extremely important,
to
my mind, for Mr Nolasco and the plaintiff, from the date when the judgment was
handed down on an ex tempore basis on 12 July 1999,
to take every step
available to ensure that the financial matters necessary to be attended to in
order that the security be provided,
and provided to the letter, as provided
for in the orders, would be available.
<P>

25   	The lateness of the application itself and the
circumstances in which the defendant is faced on such an application, having
to
meet it, as it were, on the last working day before the 9 August 1999, are also
taken into account.
<P>

26   	I further take into account a consideration of principle
which is Pt2 r3 of the Supreme Court rules which provides that:
<P>

<i>`1.	The Court may, on terms, by order, extend or abridge any time fixed by
the rules or by any judgment or order.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	The Court may extend time under subr (1) as well after as before the time
expires whether or not an application for extension is
made before the time
expires.'</i>
<P>

27   	This rule in an exercise of the discretion in a particular
factual context was under consideration by the Court of Appeal
in <i>Morgan v
45 Flers Avenue Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2011%20NSWLR%20573" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 11 NSWLR 573.</a>
<P>

28   	The case is authority for the proposition that the
discretionary powers of the Court extend to granting relief by an order
under
the rules, to which I have referred, in respect of a self executing order of
the Court pursuant to which, in default of compliance
with a direction
contained therein, an order for the dismissal of particular proceedings has
been entered.  To my mind, the existence
of that rule and the jurisdiction of
the Court in an appropriate case to grant relief, as occurred in <i>Morgan v 45
Flers Avenue</i> is a factor to be taken into account on the instant
application.
<P>

29   	The peculiar circumstances in which the relief granted on
9 and 12 July 1999 was given, are clearly documented in the reserved
judgment
and the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the Court, in the exercise of its
discretion, that the order now sought in the notice
of motion should be
made.
<P>

30   	The notice of motion is dismissed with costs.
<P>

I order that:
<P>

1.	The notice of motion filed on 6 August 1999 be dismissed.
<P>

2.	The plaintiff pay the costs of the defendant of the motion.
<P>
