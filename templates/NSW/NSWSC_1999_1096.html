<b>JUDGMENT on application for leave to proceed</b>
<P>

1   	On 11 June 1999 Rolfe J ordered that Harris Aircraft Inc of
Idaho in the United States of America (Harris Aircraft) be joined
as third
defendant pursuant to Pt8 r8 of the Supreme Court Rules, but without prejudice
to the rights of Harris Aircraft pursuant
to Pt10 r6A of the Supreme Court
Rules.  The plaintiff, by notice of motion filed on 20 August 1999, seeks leave
to proceed against
Harris Aircraft pursuant to Pt10 r2 of the rules.  By notice
of motion filed on 15 October, Harris Aircraft seek consent orders setting
aside the service of the summons on it.  Thus it is accepted the summons has
been served.  If leave to proceed is granted then the
notice of motion of
Harris Aircraft will be dismissed, but if leave to proceed is not granted then
Harris Aircraft should succeed
on its motion.  That much is accepted.
<P>

2   	The proceedings by the plaintiff against the first and
second defendants are for recovery of unpaid international air freight
service
charges of $141,821.11 plus interest.  Part of that amount is for a claim under
a particular airways bill, which claim so
far as I can see is not resisted.
The substantial issue between the plaintiff and the first and second defendants
is whether or not
there was a contract to ship the goods by air rather than, as
is claimed by the defendant, by sea.  There is a subsidiary issue as
to whether
there was some limit on the charges which could be incurred through use of an
account called a "96 Account" under the
conditions of which account it was
agreed that any person with knowledge of the 96 account number, which was
issued by the plaintiff
to the first defendant, was deemed authorised to
contract on behalf of the account number holder.  For the purpose of this
decision
it is the relationship between Harris Aircraft and the first defendant
which is of importance.
<P>

3   	It is not disputed that Harris Aircraft was an agent of the
first defendant and had been given, by that defendant, its 96 account
number.
Nor is it disputed that by using this number Harris Aircraft as agent of the
first defendant arranged for the plaintiff to
carry a large cargo of goods to
Australia.  It may be that the cargo was so large that it was unlikely to have
been expected it would
be sent by air, but that is not the question to be
decided on the present motion.  The claim against the third defendant is for
breach
of warranty of authority, namely that if it be established the plaintiff
was not authorised by Harris Aircraft, as agent for the
first defendant, to
carry the goods by air, then Harris Aircraft warranted that it was so
authorised and is liable to the plaintiff
accordingly.  Unless the authority is
challenged, and if it is, unless it is challenged on some arguable basis, leave
to proceed
should not be granted.
<P>

4   	In its application for leave to proceed, the plaintiff
relied on the following sub-rules of Pt10 rule 1A of the rules, namely
(1)(a),
(1)(b), (1)(c)(i), (ii), (iii), and (1)(i).  I do not think it necessary to set
out the argument on the sub-rules in full.
 Written submissions have been
furnished which I will leave with the papers.  Suffice it to say that breach of
warranty or authority
is a claim in contract.  Any such contract was made in
the United States between the representative of Harris Aircraft and the
representative
of the plaintiff's agent.  No cause of action arose in New South
Wales, any breach took place in the United States.  Insofar as the
subject
matter of the proceeding is concerned, that refers to the proceedings between
the plaintiff and the third defendant, and
the warranty relied upon was neither
made in this State, breached in this State nor was governed by the law of this
State.  This
means that the only basis remaining for the court to assume
jurisdiction is Pt10 r1A 1(i)(i).
<P>

5   	It is not difficult to establish a good arguable case or a
serious issue on the basis of that sub-rule.  Insofar as it was
somewhat
faintly argued that sub-rule (i) was limited to cross-claims against third
parties on the plain wording that is not correct.
 I have no doubt that if the
authority of the agent is disputed on some genuine basis then the court has a
discretion to take jurisdiction
under sub-rule (i), and it would in most cases
be appropriate to do so.  See <b><cite>Hyde v Agars</cite></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2045%20NSWLR%20485" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 45 NSWLR
485</a> at 505.
<P>

6   	Paragraph 11 of the plaintiff's contentions claims that the
first defendant knew or ought to have known that the account number
was
confidential, and that by disclosing it to any third person, that person could
use the services of the plaintiff to ship goods
anywhere in the world at the
expense of the first defendant.  That is admitted in the amended defence filed
on 5 November 1999. 
Paragraph 12 of the contentions claims that at some time
before 14 November 1997, the first defendant disclosed its 96 account number
to
an officer of the third defendant.  Paragraph 7 of the amended defence does not
admit this, but is as follows:
<P>

7.	The first defendant <u>does not admit</u> paragraph C.12 of the Summons,
<u>but says that it disclosed the 96 account number to the third defendant so
as to enable the third defendant to send the goods, which
became the subject of
AWB 7596027316, to the first defendant by air</u>.
<P>

This paragraph seems to be contradictory because while it does not admit the
disclosure it goes on to admit the disclosure.  What
this really amounts to is
an admission of disclosure of the 96 account number, but for a limited purpose
of a particular consignment
of goods, apparently because the defendant admits
it was within the monetary limit which it said it authorised.
<P>

7   	Paragraph 17 of the contentions claims that airfreight
services were authorised by the first defendant or by its agent.  It
is
accepted that the agent was Harris Aircraft.  Paragraph 11 of the amended
defence in 11(b) admits that the first defendant authorised
Harris Aircraft to
arrange for the transport of the goods the subject of the major order, "but
denies that the third defendant arranged
for or authorised the transport of the
said goods by air;" and in 11(c) further says that it did not disclose its 96
account number
to Harris Aircraft or anyone else for the purpose of transport
of the goods the subject of AWB 9597946554 which covered the large
shipment.
That is not a denial of authority.
<P>

8   	The only other relevant part of the pleading is paragraph
31 of the amended defence, which I will set out in full:
<P>

31.	Further in relation to the claim of the plaintiff in respect of AWB
7597946554 dated 14 November 1997, the defendants say (without
admission):
<P>

(a)	the plaintiff alleges at paragraph 37 of the summons that the third
defendant warranted to the plaintiff that it had authority
to use the first
defendant's DHL 96 account number (which is denied by the first and second
defendants);
<P>

(b)	the first and second defendants deny that:
<P>

(i)	the first defendant authorised the third defendant to use DHL 96 account
number <u>to transport by air the goods which became the subject of</u> AWB
7597946554;
<P>

(ii)	the third defendant warranted to the plaintiff that it had authority to
use the first defendant's DHL 96 account number <u>to transport by air the
goods which became the subject of</u> AWB 7597946554;
<P>

<u>(iii)	the third defendant requested the transport by air of the goods which
became the subject of AWB 7597946554</u>;
<P>

(c)	in the premises the first and second defendants have no liability to the
plaintiff in relation to AWB 7597946554.
<P>

In my view this paragraph does not deny the authority of Harris Aircraft, and
in any event is perfectly clear that by admitting
paragraph 11 of the
contentions, the first defendant would not be in a position to deny the
ostensible authority of Harris Aircraft
to make whatever contract was made as a
result of the disclosure of the 96 account number.  It follows from this that
there is either
no denial of authority, or if there is, it is not an arguable
point.  The question at issue in the proceedings is whether or not
there was a
contract for the shipping of the goods by air.  Whatever contract was made, was
made insofar as Harris Aircraft was involved,
as agent for a disclosed
principal.  If this is too strong a statement there is no good arguable case to
the contrary.  In those
circumstances, as a matter of discretion, I should not
give leave to proceed.  It follows that the motion of the plaintiff should
be
dismissed and an order made as sought by Harris Aircraft on its motion.  An
order should be made for the costs of Harris Aircraft
to be paid by the
plaintiff, but as to some extent those costs have been incurred by the way the
defence was originally pleaded,
the plaintiff should be at liberty to make an
application that the first defendant pay to it the costs ordered against it in
favour
of Harris Aircraft, but that should abide the final decision of this
action.
<P>

9   	The only reason this action was transferred to this Court
from the District Court was to enable joinder of the third defendant.
 In light
of my decision the matter should go back to the District Court and I will make
an appropriate order.
