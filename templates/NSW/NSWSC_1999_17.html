<P>

<b>3970 of 1996	DRINKWATER  -v-  CADDYRACK PTY 				LIMITED</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>    The substantive proceedings were heard before Young J in
1997.  His Honour made orders on 23 October 1997.  His Honour made subsequent
orders to give effect to the essential items of relief on 28 November 1997.
Those orders were entered on 12 December 1997.  They
included orders concerning
the value of shares in a company, Caddyrack Pty Ltd, and an order that, in the
event that the parties
failed to agree as to the value of those shares, a
Master hold an enquiry to certify the value of the shares.  Also included in
the
orders made by his Honour on 28 November 1997 was an order in the following
terms:
<P>

	Within 21 days of these orders each party is to serve on the other a detailed
proposal of valuation for the shares together with
any experts' reports which
are said to support such valuation.
<P>

2	In due course the matter was listed on call-over before me on 25 November
1998 for the purpose of fixing a hearing date.  The
plaintiffs had complied
with the requirement of preparing a valuation of the shares.  The defendants as
at the date of the call-over
had not complied with that requirement.  It would
appear from the correspondence that has been placed before the Court, in
particular
correspondence between the solicitors for the defendants and a firm
of solicitors in Newcastle and their Sydney agents, that no application
was
made on behalf of the defendants for an adjournment in order to enable the
defendants to place before the Court evidence of the
valuation of the shares.
But the defendants appeared upon the call-over and allowed the matter to be
fixed for hearing, with the
only evidence as to the valuation of the shares
being that which had been prepared on behalf of the plaintiffs.
<P>

3	The correspondence to which I have referred states that at the call-over the
Master directed that the defendants be ready to proceed
on the date fixed for
the hearing, being 2  February 1999.  With considerable urgency the defendants
have today, 1 February 1999,
made an application that the hearing fixed for
tomorrow, 2 February, be adjourned.  The essential basis for the application is
that
the defendants are not ready for the hearing, in that they have not
prepared any evidence as to the valuation of the shares.
<P>

4	The plaintiffs oppose any adjournment.  They point to the fact that they have
complied with the orders of the Court concerning
the valuation of the shares;
They submit that the delay in bringing on for hearing this enquiry into the
valuation of the shares
will have a prejudicial effect upon the result of that
enquiry, in that, so it is submitted, the greater the delay in having the
matter brought on for hearing, the more the events which have occurred since 25
September 1997 (that being the relevant date for
the valuation) will affect the
valuation of the shares in the company.
<P>

5	It should here be observed that the company has been wound up and a
liquidator has been appointed.  It should also here be recorded
that there is
currently pending an appeal to the Court of Appeal from the decision of Young
J.  However in that regard the Court
was at the call-over on 25 November 1998
informed on behalf of the plaintiffs that the appeal would not affect the
valuation of the
shares or the enquiry which his Honour had directed, whilst on
behalf of the defendants informed that the representative of the defendants
had
no instructions in that regard.  
<P>

6	It should also be noted that no application has ever been made by the
defendants to seek a stay of execution upon his Honour's
orders pending the
hearing of the appeal.
<P>

7	Various matters are said to have brought about the present position in which
the defendants now say they are not ready to have
the matter heard tomorrow.
<P>

8	One of those matters is that after the decision by Young J the defendants
withdrew the retainer of the solicitors, McDonald Johnson,
who had appeared for
them during the hearing at first instance, and retained another firm, Henry
Davis York.  However, in early September
1998, that is about two and a half
months before the date of the call-over to which I have already referred, the
defendants re-engaged
McDonald Johnson.  It is said on behalf of the defendants
that various matters which occurred during the period whilst Henry Davis
York
were acting for the defendants were not communicated to the current (and
original) solicitors acting for the defendants, being
McDonald Johnson.
However, quite apart from that aspect there appears to have been a very
considerable degree of lack of communication
between the solicitors for the
defendants and their Sydney agents in respect to the call-over of 25 November
1998.
<P>

9	The impression I gained from the correspondence which has been placed in
evidence is that the Court, either intentionally or unintentionally,
was led by
the representative of the defendants who appeared at the call-over to believe
that the defendants were prepared to have
the matter heard without any
valuation evidence being adduced on behalf of the defendants.  I am now told
that the defendants are
desirous of having such evidence placed before the
court.
<P>

10	What happened on 25 November 1998 at the call-over highlights the necessity
for whoever appears at a call-over to have a full
and adequate knowledge of the
case.  If the defendants at that stage had been desirous of placing before the
Court valuation evidence
and if, even despite directions as to when that
evidence should be filed, the evidence was not then available, it seems likely
that
the Court would not have proceeded to fix a hearing date. 
<P>

11	One other aspect which concerns me is that on 7 April 1998 at the time when
Henry Davis York were acting for the defendants,
the solicitors for the
plaintiffs (who I would emphasise are totally without any blame for whatever
has arisen and have at all times
acted in accordance with the various
directions of the Court) wrote to Henry Davis York noting that the plaintiffs'
valuation had
been served some time previously and saying that unless they
received a valuation from the defendants by 9 April they proposed to
approach
the Court and have the matter referred to a Master in accordance with the
orders of his Honour of 28 November 1997.  The
following day, 8 April 1998,
Henry Davis York responded to that letter and said:
<P>

	Our clients are presently having Mr McDonald value the company.  That
valuation will be completed shortly but may not be completed
by the close of
business on 9 April 1998.  Whilst that valuation is being completed we expect
that you will not take steps to have
the matter referred to the Master.
<P>

12	I am told from the Bar table by Counsel (who of course is not instructed by
Henry Davis York), that the valuation referred to
in that letter was not a
valuation of the shares but a valuation in relation to the winding-up of the
first defendant and of other
companies involved in the proceedings.  That seems
a somewhat tortured construction of the letter of 8 April 1998, which was
responding
to a letter of the previous day which clearly referred to the expert
valuation contemplated by Young J and required by the order
of the Court.
<P>

13	The Court must in considering this application for an adjournment attempt as
best it can to do justice between the parties. 
It has been submitted on behalf
of the defendants that if this matter proceeds to a hearing tomorrow the
defendants will be denied
the opportunity of placing before the Court evidence
to be obtained on their behalf as to the value of the shares.  The Court in
those circumstances would be left only with the valuation obtained on behalf of
the plaintiffs.  The defendants would, without having
expert advice, have
considerable difficulty in conducting the cross-examination in relation to the
valuation of the plaintiffs. 

<P>

14	I appreciate that any adjournment of the matter will cause prejudice to the
plaintiffs.  I appreciate also that the Court expressly
stated on 25 November
1998 that the matter would be heard on 2 February and that the defendants
should be in a position to proceed
to a hearing on that date.
<P>

15	I have already emphasised that there can be no criticism whatsoever directed
to the conduct of the plaintiffs or their legal
advisers in this matter and
that the entirety of the criticism of the Court should be directed to the
defendants and their legal
advisers, the principals in Newcastle, their Sydney
agents, and the previous solicitors who were retained for a period on behalf
of
the defendants.  It is sometimes said that the Court in such circumstances,
where it is the legal advisers who are to blame for
a situation which has
arisen, should allow the parties to seek redress against those legal advisers
and should not grant an adjournment
in circumstances such as the present.
Nevertheless, I am of the view that it is appropriate that the matter should
not proceed to
a hearing tomorrow.  
<P>

16	I propose to vacate tomorrow's hearing date.  I propose to fix another
hearing date before myself at the earliest opportunity
and to make mandatory
directions addressed to the defendants concerning the filing of evidence in
relation to the valuation of the
shares.  
<P>

17	I propose to make an order that the defendants pay the costs of the
plaintiffs of today's application and the costs of the plaintiffs
thrown away
by reason of the vacating of tomorrow's date.  I should indicate that I propose
to reserve to the defendants leave for
them to make an application that those
costs be borne by one or more of the various firms of solicitors who have been
involved in
the situation and who appear to have been responsible for the
position which has now arisen.
<P>

18		I make the following orders:
<P>

	1.	Upon the application of the defendants, which is 	opposed by the
plaintiffs, I vacate the hearing date of 	2 February 1999.
<P>

	2.	I direct that this matter be heard by me on a date to 	be fixed by
arrangement with my Associate in the 	month of March 1999.
<P>

	3.	I order that the defendants on or before 22 February 	1999 serve upon the
plaintiffs all affidavits of 	valuation of the shares
referred to in the order
made 	on 28 November 1997 and entered on 12 December 	1997.
<P>

	4.	I order that the defendants pay the costs of the 	plaintiffs of the notice
of motion filed by the 	defendants on 1 February
1999 and the costs 	occasioned
by the vacating of the hearing date of 2 	February 1999.
<P>

	5.	I grant leave to the plaintiffs to proceed forthwith to 	assessment of the
foregoing costs.
<P>

	6. 	I reserve to the defendants liberty to apply on seven 	days' notice for an
order substituting for the 	defendants in order
4 hereof any or all of the
present 	or past solicitors for the defendants or the agent or 	agents of such
solicitors.
