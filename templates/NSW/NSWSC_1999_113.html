<i>Tuesday, 23 February 1999</i>
<P>

<b>4597/97	GERALD MICALLEF &amp; ANOR   -v-   ROLAND OFRIA &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b> There is presently before me a notice of
motion which was filed in Court this day on behalf of the plaintiffs, Gerald
Micallef and
Norman Micallef.
<P>

2   	In that notice of motion the plaintiffs seek a number of
items of relief against the defendants, Roland Ofria and Marlene Ofria.

<P>

3   	At today's hearing Mr Roland Ofria, the first defendant
appeared in person. I have treated him to be appearing not only for
himself but
also for his wife, Marlene Ofria, the second defendant.
<P>

4   	The first substantive order of relief sought in the notice
of motion is that contained in paragraph 2, which seeks an order
for the
defence of the first and second defendants to be struck out.
<P>

5   	So far as I am aware, and this appears to be the
understanding of the legal representatives of the plaintiffs, no defence has
ever been filed by the defendant. Indeed, since the proceedings were instituted
by summons, it would be strange if there had in fact
been such a defence
filed.
<P>

6   	Accordingly, I shall disregard the application made by the
plaintiffs in paragraph 2 of the notice of motion. 
<P>

7   	The second substantive item of relief sought in the notice
of motion is an order that the cross claim of the first and second
defendants
be struck out.
<P>

8   	I have already observed that the proceedings were
instituted by summons. That document was filed on 31 October 1997. The summons
seeks relief concerning certain commercial premises situate at and known as 431
Gardeners Road, Mascot.
<P>

9   	It would appear that those premises were owned by the
plaintiffs and the defendants as tenants in common, each of the plaintiffs
between themselves holding their share in the subject premises as joint tenants
and each of the defendants as between themselves
holding their share in the
subject premises as joint tenants.
<P>

10   	Prayers 1,2 and 3 of the summons seek orders for the
appointment of statutory trustees for sale of the subject premises, pursuant
to
the provisions of Division 6 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/index.html#p4" class="autolink_findacts">Part 4</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act </i>1919</a>.
<P>

11   	I have been informed that the subject premises have in
fact already been sold and that the plaintiffs are no longer seeking
the relief
claimed in prayers 1,2 and 3 of the summons.
<P>

12   	The remaining prayers of the summons relate to a claim by
the plaintiffs that the defendants should provide an account of
all money
received and disbursed by them and any other person on their behalf in respect
of the subject property and of the dealings
and transactions of the
defendants.
<P>

13   	I have not been taken to any orders which might have been
made, either by consent or otherwise, for the providing of such
an account by
the defendants. I will in due course come back to the matter of the relief
sought by the plaintiffs in the summons.
<P>

14   	The defendants on 23 December 1997 filed a cross claim.
Somewhat curiously, since the proceedings were instituted by summons,
the cross
claim takes the form of a pleading. 
<P>

15   	However it does seek various items of relief. Essentially
the relief which appears to be sought by the defendants in their
cross claim is
relief in respect of moneys expended by them in repairs and improvements to the
subject property.
<P>

16   	One might have thought that, if the defendants had
expended money in relation to the subject property, details of that expenditure
would have been relevant to the account which the plaintiffs are seeking that
the defendant should provide, and that in due course,
after the provision of
the account and the taking of the various steps in relation thereto which are
enumerated in prayers 1 to 11
of the summons, an inquiry of the nature
contemplated in prayer 12 of the summons would be held, and that eventually the
Court would
upon such an inquiry make a determination either of an amount, as
amounts payable by the defendants to the plaintiffs or asserted
by the cross
claim payable by the plaintiffs to the defendants.
<P>

17   	Whilst it might be thought that in those circumstances the
cross claim would not have been necessary, nevertheless the defendants
should
not be precluded, if they so desire, from having the nature of their relief set
forth in and claimed by way of a cross claim
(although. as I have already
observed it, is somewhat curious that they have filed as a cross claim a
document in the form of a pleading
in proceedings which have been instituted by
summons).
<P>

18   	It would appear that this matter has a lengthy procedural
history. Various solicitors have at various times acted for the
defendant. Most
recently, the firm of Haywards and Belinski acted for the defendant. Their
retainer was determined by the defendants
on 3 December 1998. However Horowitz
&amp; Bilinsky were acting for the defendants on 28 September 1998 when, by
consent, orders
were made in accordance with short minutes of order.
<P>

19   	The first of those orders was that the defendants file and
serve an amended cross claim within seven days. The terms of that
order appear
to contemplate that the defendants no longer wish to rely upon the cross claim
which had been filed on 23 December 1997
--- that is some nine months
previously.
<P>

20   	In response to an inquiry by me during the course of
today's hearing, Mr Ofria agreed that the defendants no longer wish to
rely
upon the cross claim which was filed on 23 December 1997.
<P>

21   	The defendants however did not file and serve an amended
cross claim, either within seven days of 28 September 1998 or at
any time
thereafter.
<P>

22   	No explanation has been given to the Court as to why such
an amended cross claim was not filed within the specified period,
or indeed at
any other time up to 3 December 1998 when the retainer of Horowitz &amp;
Bilinsky was terminated by the defendants.
<P>

23   	Mr Ofria gave as an explanation for the failure of the
defendants to file an amended cross claim after Horowitz &amp; Bilinski
ceased
to act for him, that he did not have all the documents in the matter and that
the documents had been retained by Horowitz
&amp; Bilinski.
<P>

24   	I gather that that firm has declined to release those
documents to the defendants until certain professional costs are paid.
<P>

25   	Mr Ofria also made reference to awaiting a decision from
the High Court. I do not understand that reference. If it is a reference
to a
decision of the High Court of Australia I do not understand how there can be
any involvement of the High Court of Australia
in the present proceedings,
certainly not at the stage which the present proceedings have to this point
reached.
<P>

26   	Essentially, the plaintiffs submit that the cross claim
filed on 23 December 1997 should be struck out for what amounts to
(it was
submitted) want of prosecution; that is, that the defendants have failed to
comply with the consent order made on 28 September
1998, that they file an
amended cross claim. Further, that the defendants failed to participate in the
directions hearing before
the Registrar on 11 December 1998; and further, that
the defendants have failed to make adequate discovery.
<P>

27   	In that last respect, it should be recorded that an order
for discovery was made on 21 May 1998. The defendants filed a list
of documents
and subsequently an amended list of documents, that latter being filed on 15
June 1998.
<P>

28   	The plaintiffs complain that even that amended list of
documents is not complete, in that various documents referred to in
correspondence between the parties and documents relating to at least one
person who is said to have been a tenant in the subject
property and also
material relating to electricity accounts of the subject property have not been
provided by the defendants to the
plaintiff.
<P>

29   	The plaintiffs rely upon the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5</a> rule 12
of the Supreme Court Rules. Subrule (1) of that rule provides, 
<P>

Where a plaintiff makes default in complying with any order or direction as to
the conduct of the proceedings, or does not prosecute
the proceedings with due
despatch, the Court may, on application by any party or of its own motion, stay
or dismiss the proceedings.
<P>

30   	I have assumed, although I have not been taken to any
express provision of the Rules in that regard, that the reference to
a
plaintiff in that subrule has equal application to a cross claimant who does
not prosecute his cross claim with due despatch.
<P>

31   	Not only does it appear that the defendants have not
prosecuted with due despatch the cross claim filed by them on 23 December
1997,
but it emerges that it is not that document which the defendants wish to
advance as setting forth the claim that they wish
to make against the
plaintiffs.
<P>

32   	I do not have before me any explanation as to the
circumstances in which the defendants no longer are represented by solicitors.
But I see from the letter which was sent by the solicitors for the plaintiff to
the defendants personally on 11 February 1999 that
it would appear that at the
directions hearing before the Registrar on 9 February 1999 the Registrar
suggested that the defendants
should obtain urgent legal advice and
representation.
<P>

33   	There appears to be no adequate explanation for the
defendants not having filed the amended cross claim which almost five
months
ago they appear to have been desirous of filing.
<P>

34   	There is no adequate explanation for the defendants not
having provided the additional information and documentary material
sought in
correspondence and by way of discovery from them at the insistence of the
plaintiffs.
<P>

35   	In those circumstances, therefore, I am satisfied that it
is appropriate that I should at this stage of the proceedings strike
out the
defendants' cross claim which was filed on 23 December 1997.
<P>

36   	There is also further substantive relief sought in the
notice of motion filed by the plaintiffs this day, 23 February 1999.
That is
the relief sought in paragraph 4 of the notice of motion. 
<P>

37   	That paragraph seeks judgment for the plaintiffs for
damages to be assessed. That appears to me to be a totally inappropriate
claim
for relief in respect of substantive proceedings which seek the giving of an
account by the defendants.
<P>

38   	Eventually, after the various procedural steps
contemplated in the summons of being completed, it may be that when the
ultimate
inquiry has been conducted, the plaintiffs may be entitled to payment
of an amount of money by the defendants.
<P>

39   	There is no certainty of that result. As I have already
observed, the defendants are fully entitled in the proceedings for
an account,
in order to raise all the matters concerning the expenditure by them on the
said property which they appear to have wished
to raise in the cross claim or
in the amended cross claim.
<P>

40   	It is totally premature for the plaintiffs at this stage
to seek relief in the nature of summary judgment in proceedings which
they have
instituted seeking that there be an account taken of the dealings of the
defendants with the subject property.
<P>

41   	Accordingly I propose to dismiss the claim for relief
contained in paragraph 4 of the summons.
<P>

42   	DISCUSSION ENSUED CONCERNING COSTS.
<P>

43   	<b>MASTER:</b>  I make the following orders:
<P>

1. 	I order that the cross-claim filed by the defendants on 23 December 1997 be
struck out.
<P>

2.	I order that the application made by the plaintiffs in paragraphs 2 and 4 in
the notice of motion filed by the plaintiffs on
23 February 1999 be
dismissed.
<P>

3. 	I order that the costs of the aforesaid notice of motion be the plaintiffs'
costs in the proceedings.
<P>

4.	Stand over to Monday, 8 March 1999 before the Registrar for directions.
