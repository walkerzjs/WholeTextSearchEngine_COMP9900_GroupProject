<i>Friday, 5 March 1999</i>
<P>

<b>3231/97	QUEENSBORO PTY LIMITED  -v-  BUTLER POLLNOW PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:   </b>By notice of motion filed on 24 February
1999 the cross-claimants Butler Pollnow Pty Ltd and Errol Pollnow seek,
substantively, an
order for judgment against Alexander Barclay Shand, the
eighth cross-defendant and Alan Gordon Coogan the ninth cross-defendant on
the
first and second cross-claims.  At the commencement of the hearing I stated and
had it recorded that I am acquainted with the
eighth cross-defendant, Alexander
Barclay Shand.  That factor caused no problem to either the cross-claimant or
the eighth and ninth
defendants to my hearing the present application.
<P>

2   	Mr John Leslie, solicitor for the cross-claimants, at the
commencement of the hearing stated that he had already made to Mr
Gorezyca, the
solicitor for the eighth and ninth cross-defendants, an offer which he wished
now to repeat in open Court as an open
offer to those parties.  The open offer
was that the cross-claimants would allow the eighth and ninth cross-defendants
a further
fourteen days in which to file their defences to the first and second
cross, claims but that in the event that they did not file
their defences
within that period there would be judgments against those cross-defendants on
the cross claims, and that the cross-defendants
should pay the costs of the
cross-claimants of the present notice of motion.  
<P>

3   	Mr Gorezyca, although agreeable to two of the components of
that open offer (being the filing of the defences within fourteen
days and the
order for costs), did not at that stage accept the open offer which had been
made by Mr Leslie.
<P>

4   	After the conclusion of the submissions by the respective
legal representatives of the parties to the notice of motion I commenced
to
deliver an ex tempore oral judgment.  Very shortly after I had so commenced Mr
Gorezyca informed the Court that he on behalf of
his clients was prepared to
accept the open offer which had been made by Mr Leslie.  It became unnecessary
for me therefore to proceed
to a completion of my reasons for judgment or to
express any conclusions as to what my order would have been if the matter had
proceeded
to a completion of my reasons for judgment herein.  
<P>

5   	Accordingly, I now make the following orders which are
consequent upon the open offer made by Mr Leslie and the acceptance
by Mr
Gorezyca of that open offer and which are in a form which has been expressed by
both gentlemen to accord with their understanding
of the terms of that open
offer and of the acceptance thereof.  I make the following orders:
<P>

(1)	I order that the eighth and ninth cross-defendants file and serve their
defences to the first and second cross claims on or
before 29 March 1999.
<P>

(2)	I order that, in the event that the eighth and ninth cross-defendants do
not file and serve their defences to the first and
second cross claims on or
before 29 March 1999, judgment for damages and/or for equitable compensation in
amounts to be assessed,
together with interest thereon, be entered for the
cross-claimants upon those cross claims.
<P>

(3)	I order that the eighth and ninth cross-defendants pay the costs of the
cross-claimants of the notice of motion filed by the
cross-claimants on 24
February 1999, such costs to include the costs reserved by the Registrar on 8
March 1999.
<P>

(4)	I grant leave to the cross-claimants to proceed forthwith to assessment of
the foregoing costs.
<P>
