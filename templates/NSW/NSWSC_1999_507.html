<P>

Defendant
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT -- </b>Ex Tempore
<P>

<b>26 May1999</b>
<P>

1   	I propose to indicate the conclusion I have reached in the
matter before me, with brief reasons, in view of the urgency of
the matter.
<P>

2   	The matter presently before me is an application on behalf
of the Defendant company Local Government Recycling co-operative
Limited
("LGRC") or more precisely its administrator appointed on 26 May 1999 that this
Court adjourn the hearing of the Plaintiff's
application for an order to wind
up LGRC. The Plaintiff is Waste Recycling and Processing Service of New South
Wales (t/as Waste
Service NSW) "Waste Service" and claims to be a creditor in
an amount of not less than $809,388.54 of LGRC. That Waste Services is
a
creditor in that amount or at all is disputed by LGRC at this point, though it
is fair to say that the newly appointed administrator
Mr Palmer, who is
independent of the Plaintiff, Defendant and so far as is known principal
creditors, has yet to form a view on the
matter. I should record that Mr Palmer
was appointed this morning following the resignation yesterday of Mr Star who
had been appointed
yesterday as Administrator.
<P>

3   	The particular provision relevant to to-day's application
is contained in s440(2) and is in the following terms:
<P>

"The Court is to adjourn the hearing of an application for an order to wind up
a company if the company is under administration
and the Court is satisfied
that it is in the interests of the company's creditors for the company to
continue under administration
rather than be wound up."
<P>

4   	I should also, for completeness, quote s440A(3) in the
following terms:
<P>

"<b>440A(3)    [Provisional liquidator]</b>  The Court is not to appoint a
provisional liquidator of a company if the company is under administration and
the Court is satisfied
that it is in the interests of the company's creditors
for the company to continue under administration rather than have a provisional
liquidator appointed."
<P>

5   	These provisions are contained in Pt 5.3A of the
<i>Corporations Law</i>, the objects of which so far as they pertain to
administration of the Company's affairs with a view to executing a deed of
company
arrangement, are set out in s435A quoted below
<P>

"<b>435A</b>  The object of this Part is to provide for the business, property
and affairs of an insolvent company to be administered in a way
that:
<P>

(a)	maximises the chances of the company, or as much as possible of its
business, continuing in existence; or
<P>

(b)	if it is not possible for the company or its business to continue in
existence -- results in a better return for the company's
creditors and members
than would result from an immediate winding up of the company."
<P>

6   	Whether adjournment is as required by s440A(2) "in the
interests of the company's creditors" must be affected by the length
of
adjournment envisaged, where the adjournment is only for a limited time. It is
also affected by the envisaged purpose and likely
consequences of such
adjournment. This must frequently be judged in circumstances where outcomes are
not susceptible of certain prediction,
with the onus nonetheless remaining with
the administrator. A short adjournment may in some cases permit a greater level
of assurance
of salvageability or otherwise to be assessed in the interests of
creditors by an independent administrator, without adverse countervailing
consequences from such a short delay. On the one hand to grant such an
adjournment there must be a sufficient possibility, as distinct
from mere
optimistic speculation, that such a deferment for the envisaged time is in the
interests of creditors; see <i>Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Yates Security
Services Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2015%20ACLC%2048" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 15 ACLC 48.</a> On that question, views may
legitimately differ. Often to be weighed is the certainty of adverse
consequence for creditors if liquidation
ensues as against the prospect of a
better outcome, but no certainty, under administration, provided a deed of
company arrangement
can be successfully negotiated with creditors to underpin
that outcome. To be taken into account, along with level of uncertainty
of
outcome, are any consequences of delay for even a short time. Thus for example
in the case of any potential preferences, the six
month relation back period
will be deferred by the difference between the date the winding up application
was made and the date of
administration -- here but a matter of six weeks (15
October 1998 compared to 25 November 1998). However, no submission was put that
this factor should matter here to any significant degree. The shortness of the
adjournment and its purpose are thus relevant factors
in the application of my
discretion.
<P>

7   	The Plaintiff's position is that it considers that there is
no prospect of the Defendant under administration or otherwise
being in a
position to continue to trade and that the Defendant's financial position is
such that the only proper course is to wind-up
the Defendant or at the least
appoint a provisional liquidator.
<P>

8   	SMS Municipal Services Limited ("SMS") as the next largest
claimant creditor, has taken a relatively neutral position throughout
these
proceedings. It claims to be a creditor in the amount of $377,716 (though this
debt is disputed at this stage). It takes the
position that it does not put any
submission one way or the other as to whether an adjournment should be granted.
It can be inferred
that it would benefit from an independent assessment, as
would indeed other creditors.
<P>

9   	When the application under s444A(2) was made for the first
time yesterday, it followed the appointment of Mr Star as administrator
that
day. At that point the Plaintiff had completed its evidence whilst the
Defendant's evidence was substantially completed. That
evidence was in relation
to an application from the Plaintiff to wind-up the Defendant in circumstances
where to that point, the
Defendant had contended that it was solvent. 
<P>

10   	A crucial underpinning to that contention was expressed by
Mr Star in his second report of 24 May 1999 in these terms:  "I
have formed the
view that, provided adequate financing facilities are made available LGRC has
reasonable prospects of success." However,
it has since transpired as of the
day Mr Star was appointed administrator that the only financier approached,
National Australia
Bank, declined to lend. That underpinning also included
fulfilment of the assumptions contained in Mr Star's earlier report dated
4 May
1999 set out in Annexure D to Mr Star's affidavit of 5 May 1999. I set these
out below:

9.	The plant and machinery in storage at Waste Service Chullora is not
released. There will be a small profit on sale of asset if
the $55,000 sale
proceeds. The LGRC claim for loss of profit for the delay in obtaining release
of the machinery from Waste Service
is not included.
<P>

10.	that the information furnished by LGRC and Mr Campbell's advices are
correct.
<P>

11.	LGRC does not owe S.M.S. Municipal Services Pty Limited $377,716.46 but
rather is owed $136.34 from this entity as per the attached
correspondence
dated 3 May 1999, Annexure "E" hereto.
<P>

12.	Going concern basis of valuation.
<P>

13.	Going concern operations are maintained and reasonable profits are
generated from same.
<P>

14.	Distributions of surplus to member Councils have not been accounted for in
LGRC's financial statements, Report as to Affairs
or Budgets. Mr Campbell has
advised that such distributions are not due until such time that LGRC has
generated a surplus and agrees
to distribute it.
<P>

15.	Debtors greater than ninety days have been written off or provided for.
<P>

16.	Trade Creditors continue to provide credit at 60/90 day terms.
<P>

17.	Debtors are paid or realised within 30 days."
<P>

11   	It will be apparent that these assumptions importantly
include a calculation of the amount said to be owed by LGRC to Waste
Service
after various strongly contested claims for offsets and on the basis, also
contested by the Plaintiff, that non-payment of
LGRC customers excuses LGRC in
turn from paying Waste Service is to be reduced to $7,504.55. Based on the
evidence and argument before
me, though recognising that as at present I am
dealing with the matter on an interlocutory basis, I am not satisfied that such
reduction
can properly be made in either case.
<P>

12   	There were indeed competing contentions between Plaintiff
and Defendant as to the nature of the relationship between them.
The Plaintiff
contends that the relationship was one where it sold product from waste
management processing to the Defendant and
that the indebtedness therefor was
unpaid purchase money now due and owing. The Defendant contends rather that the
relationship was
one in which it was some kind of commission agent for the
Plaintiff to sell such product and that accordingly the relevant calculation
could only be made on a balance of account. It is then said that, if so made,
the offsets referred to above would be justified. Likewise,
the proposition
that non-payment of LGRC customers of accounts processed by Waste Service meant
that LGRC had no obligation to pay
Waste Service's charges in respect of the
said sales until LGRC has received payment. These two items total $659,997.
<P>

13   	But there was no documentation or other convincing
evidence which sufficiently established the propositions that the Defendant
put
in relation to these two items. I am not satisfied that the indebtedness of the
Plaintiff should be reduced by those items. Once
those items are added back, it
is clear that Waste Service is the principal creditor of the Defendant. Other
creditors, according
to the Defendant, (see Mr Star's second report, Schedule
H) total $387,599. It is already noted that SMS would on this calculation
be
the second largest creditor. It has not indicated at this point its ultimate
stance on the alternatives of liquidation versus
administration leading to a
deed of company arrangement. But it should still follow that even if SMS were
to take a contrary view
to the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff would be able to block
the passing of any creditor's resolution in relation to a deed of company
arrangement. Voting for creditors meeting is determined by regulations
5.6.21(2) and (3) which precludes a resolution being passed
if a majority in
value vote against (though the "and" in 5.6.21(3) might suggest otherwise at
first glance). That result of course
presupposes that the calculation of the
amount owed to the Plaintiff is not to be reduced in the manner contended for
by the Defendant.
Whilst the conclusions I have reached are in the context of
an interlocutory determination of that matter; nonetheless it is fair
to note
that the Defendant's instructions are at present not to put any further
evidence or submissions in relation to that matter
or generally.
<P>

14   	Against that background, I am called to decide whether the
administrator has satisfied the onus upon him under s440A(2) "that
it is in the
interests of the company's creditors for the company to continue under
administration rather than be wound up".
<P>

15   	In <i>Creevey and another v Deputy Commissioner of
Taxation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2032%20ATR%20632" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 32 ATR 632</a>, McPherson JA expressed the relevant principle
in these terms: 
<P>

"In order to satisfy the court that it is in the creditors' interests to allow
the administration to continue, it must be shown,
in a practical sense, that
the company has assets which, if realised under an administration (as distinct
from a winding up), would
produce a larger dividend, or at least an accelerated
dividend for the creditors."
<P>

16   	In a more recent decision of the Federal Court of a single
judge Parkinson JR <i>Fullview Pty Ltd v WLW Pty Ltd</i> (FCA, Parkinson JR, 17
September 1997, unreported) the test was put in somewhat less stringent terms:

<P>

"the question to be determined is whether having regard to the interests of the
creditors there would result from the continued
administration a better return
than if the company is wound up ...... 
<P>

However ...... in view of the continuing concurrent meetings of creditors, I am
satisfied that a mere possibility of a return to
creditors is sufficient basis
for the exercise of the discretion in s440A(2) at this point in time."
<P>

17   	Significantly, in that case the administrators, having
examined the affairs of the companies in question, had already reported
to the
creditors recommending that a deed of company arrangement be executed to be
conditional upon the outcome of various creditors'
meetings. The position in
the present case is that the administrator has just embarked upon the
administration and could not as yet
form even a preliminary view, though can do
so very shortly.
<P>

18   	While the Plaintiff has made a powerful case for there
being no further deferral of consideration of its winding-up application
and
whilst it is clear that the Defendant is either insolvent or may shortly be
insolvent, with even Mr Star putting no opposition
to the contention that the
first proposition was correct, I have concluded that the proper course in all
the circumstances is to
allow a very brief adjournment. That adjournment is
until next Tuesday 1 June 1999 by 12 noon when the administrator has indicated
that for the modest expenditure of up to $15,000 he could give the Court the
benefit of a preliminary view as to the prospects of
the Defendant being able
to continue to trade and, relevantly for present purposes, whether in a
practical sense such continued trading
coupled with any realisation of assets
on a going concern basis or otherwise, would produce a larger dividend or at
least an accelerated
dividend for creditors as against an immediate winding-up.
I should add in that context that the appointment of either a provisional
liquidator or liquidator would still permit, if circumstances justify that
course, the liquidator to retire in favour of an administrator,
pursuant to
s436B(1) of the <i>Corporations Law</i> and, with the leave of the court, such
liquidator may appoint himself. However, the prospects of sale on a going
concern basis may
well by then have been lost.
<P>

19   	I reiterate that in considering whether "it is in the
interests of the company's creditors for the company to continue under
administration rather than be wound up" and recognising that the onus lies on
the administrator, a court may, in appropriate circumstances
such as these,
conclude that for the brief period envisaged, and to allow a more informed
appraisal for the longer term though subject
to what may then transpire, such
an adjournment should be allowed. SMS at this point has decided to remain
neutral, so that further
information will, it can be inferred assist it, as
well as other creditors, even if the Plaintiff at this point feels it already
knows enough. It is clear enough from the evidence before me that liquidation
would immediately destroy any real hope for realisation
of the assets on the
higher going concern basis and thus preclude any prospect of a higher or
quicker dividend. Whereas it cannot
yet be concluded that there is no real
possibility of finding the necessary on-going finance, having regard to the
support hitherto
forthcoming from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
from the same or another financier than the National Australia Bank. That
alternative had not yet been investigated. All of this can be pursued by the
administrator, on a preliminary basis, at least.
<P>

<b>ORDERS</b>
<P>

20   	Accordingly, I order that the hearing of the Plaintiff's
application for an order to wind up the Defendant be adjourned until
the
expiration of 1 June 1999 or to such earlier date as I may order in the event
that the matter comes back before me earlier, in
order that I may consider a
report from the administrator as to the matters earlier noted in my
judgment.
<P>

21   	I further direct that the administrator provide such a
report by 12 noon on 1 June 1999 and that the matter come before me
at 3.30 pm
that day for any further orders.
<P>

22   	I give liberty to apply at short notice.
<P>

23   	Finally, I note that in the event that I should conclude
on 1 June 1999 or indeed earlier if the matter comes back before
me earlier,
that the winding-up is not further adjourned, it is understood that the
Plaintiff will apply for the administrator to
be removed and for a liquidator
or provisional liquidator to be appointed, relying upon s447A of the
<i>Corporations Law </i>for that purpose.
