DECISION: 
<P>

Plea of not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter on the basis of
diminished responsibility
<P>

JUDGMENT: 
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  Elvan Ricky Gunes is for sentence today having pleaded
guilty to manslaughter. The prisoner was originally charged with the murder
of
his father, Mehmet Gunes, to which charge he pleaded not guilty to murder but
guilty to manslaughter. The Crown accepted that
plea in full discharge of the
indictment on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
<P>

2	For reasons which will become apparent during the course of these remarks on
sentence I am of the view that the Crown's acceptance
of the plea was
undoubtedly proper. The maximum sentence prescribed by the <b>Crimes Act</b>
for the crime of manslaughter is twenty-five years penal servitude.
<P>

3	I turn then to the objective facts in the matter. The killing of Mehmet Gunes
was a particularly horrific one. Mehmet Gunes was
the father of the prisoner.
Mehmet Gunes died as a result of severe burns he suffered when the prisoner,
having rendered him either
senseless or certainly immobile following a fight,
poured petrol over him and set the petrol alight. This occurred somewhere
between
7.30 pm and 7.55 pm on 3 December 1997 at the Gunes' family residence
at Mangerton.
<P>

4	The prisoner had obtained the petrol from beneath the house where it had been
kept for the purpose of fuelling a lawn mower. The
reason for the prisoner's
presence at the family home that night was the culmination of family
disputation which extended back for
a number of years. I shall go into the
circumstances of that disputation in some little more detail when dealing with
the subjective
circumstances relating to the prisoner.
<P>

5	However, it is relevant to note when dealing with the objective circumstances
that jewellery, consisting principally of gold objects
had been originally
given by the prisoner's parents to his wife on the occasion of the prisoner's
marriage. Jewellery had been returned
by the prisoner's wife to her
father-in-law as part of a family arrangement under which household goods would
be passed to the prisoner
following the return of the jewellery.
<P>

6	Earlier on 3 December 1997 Mehmet Gunes had reported to police that the
prisoner had, on the evening before, attended the family
residence at Mangerton
and had obtained the subject jewellery after threatening his father with a
knife as a consequence of which
his father had handed the jewellery to him.
Indeed, police, during the course of the morning, saw the prisoner at a pawn
shop where
he was raising money by pawning the jewellery. Police had then
warned him to stay away from his father.
<P>

7	The prisoner's stated objective in returning to his parents' home that night
was to remove goods which he believed were rightly
his. Neither of his parents
were home when he first arrived - his mother was in fact in hospital receiving
treatment for a renal
condition. When his father did return home a dispute
arose between the prisoner and himself and the fight I have referred to ensued.
The father was knocked down and subsequently burned in the manner I have
described.
<P>

8	I turn then to the subjective features. The prisoner is now aged thirty-five,
having been born in Turkey on 23 September 1963.
The prisoner and his family
came to this country when he was six or seven years of age. The family
consisted of the prisoner's parents,
both of whom as of 3 December 1997 were in
their early sixties and his brother and sister who are now aged thirty-seven
and thirty-four
respectively. The family settled in the Wollongong area and
until his retirement the prisoner's father was employed at the steel
works.
<P>

9	Relations between the prisoner and his father appeared to have been good for
most of the prisoner's life. On the other hand relations
between the prisoner
and his mother were poor for some considerable time. Having left school at the
age of fifteen, having been an
average student, the prisoner has had a somewhat
chequered employment history. It is not necessary for the purposes of these
remarks
to detail his past employment. However, it is relevant to observe that
the chequered nature of his employment history is no doubt
related to his
psychiatric condition.
<P>

10	The prisoner's family, being of Turkish extraction, returned to the place of
their birth on numerous occasions. In the case of
the prisoner's mother
apparently at one time for a period of years. While I have described the
relationship between the prisoner
and his father as being good for most of his
life, the fact is that after an altercation between that pair in 1995, his
father financed
a trip for the prisoner to his native land. There the prisoner
married his wife Zeynep on 17 May 1995. Indeed at the time of the
prisoner's
marriage in Turkey both his parents were residing in Turkey and did not in fact
return to Australia until 1 November 1997.

<P>

11	The prisoner and his wife had returned earlier to this country on 11
November 1995. On their return they had lived at the Gunes'
family home at
Mangerton until March 1997 when the couple, whose marriage apparently had been
a stormy one, effectively had broken
up, a separation occurring in March
1997.
<P>

12	The prisoner's wife remained at the Gunes' family house until 20 November
1997. The prisoner apparently lived in a guest house
in Wollongong after March
1997. There is one child of the union between the prisoner and his wife.
Apparently the prisoner's wife
has now returned to Turkey.
<P>

13	I now turn to the relevant medical history of the prisoner. Concerns about
the prisoner's mental health were first noted at a
hospital in 1988. The
prisoner had come under police notice following threats he had made to a girl
with whom he had had a relationship
when she had terminated that association.
Indeed, an AVO had been taken out against him. An assault conviction resulting
from that
very breach resulted in the prisoner being gaoled for two months.
<P>

14	Because the prisoner had exhibited suicidal tendencies he was scheduled to
the Shellharbour Hospital on 18 August 1988. Originally
he was diagnosed as
having a paranoid psychosis at the time but curiously enough by 22 August 1988
a treating psychiatrist concluded
that "there was no evidence of mental
illness" - albeit that the treating psychiatrist was of the view that the
prisoner was dangerous.
As a consequence of the psychiatrist's view as to his
mental state the magistrate discharged him from his scheduling.
<P>

15	It is relevant to note at this stage that such criminal history as the
prisoner had prior to this conviction effectively terminated
in 1988. Other
than driving offences and two offences of dishonesty the prisoner had also
received a bond in 1982 when he was but
eighteen for assault occasioning actual
bodily harm. Latterly, the prisoner was apprehended for failing to stop at a
red light in
Sydney on 28 November 1997 which has relevance when considering
his mental condition. However, the prisoner's criminal history is
not a matter
upon which I have given any weight in considering an appropriate sentence.
<P>

16	I return to the history of the prisoner's mental condition. His treating
general practitioner, a Dr Iqbal of Cringila first observed
mental disturbances
on 9 July 1988 when the prisoner told that doctor of having hallucinations and
paranoid thoughts. He was prescribed
Sinequan for a depressive state from which
Dr Iqbal thought he was suffering and referred him to Dr G Davies,
psychiatrist.
<P>

17	Dr Iqbal next reports problems of mental difficulties in November 1994 when
the prisoner complained to him of being depressed,
anxious and losing sleep and
not being able to think clearly. At that time he had suicidal thoughts. Prozac
was prescribed but he
did not follow that treatment. He was referred again to
Dr Davies. 
<P>

18	Dr Davies reports on seeing the prisoner only twice, on 18 January 1995 and
13 December 1995. Dr Iqbal had arranged for the prisoner
to see that
psychiatrist on 1 December 1997 but he failed to keep that appointment.
<P>

19	In January 1995 having received a history from the prisoner of depression,
suicidal ideation, irritability and aggression Dr
Davies concluded that the
prisoner suffered from a personality deterioration probably of schizophrenic
origin and prescribed for
him a major tranquilliser. 
<P>

20	He next saw the prisoner in December 1995. At this time the prisoner was on
a disability pension. His purpose in wishing to see
Dr Davies was to obtain
documentation stating that he was unfit for military service as he wished to
return to Turkey where he was
likely to be conscripted. Having carried out the
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory test and conducting an examination
Dr
Davies concluded that it was highly likely that he was suffering from a
schizophrenic illness. It was Dr Davies' view that the prisoner
was suffering
from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the killing of his father and was
likely to have been in a psychotic state
at that stage.
<P>

21	He last saw Dr Iqbal on the day of his father's killing. I glean he had seen
Dr Iqbal on that occasion following his apprehension
by police for disobeying a
red light while driving. I gather that he had been arrested and in fact placed
in the cells following
this driving offence as a consequence of his conduct
when the police apprehended him.
<P>

22	He had been seen in the cells by a Mr Michael Betts who was acting as duty
solicitor at the time. So odd was his conduct during
the interview which Mr
Betts had with him that Mr Betts concluded that the prisoner was suffering from
a mental illness and it was
he who organised the appointment for the prisoner
to see Dr Iqbal.
<P>

23	When Dr Iqbal saw him on 3 December he made a number of complaints about his
parents, the police and the problems he had with
his marriage. It seemed that
Dr Iqbal convinced him that he should once more see Dr Davies and the prisoner
agreed that this should
happen. 
<P>

24	Since his apprehension for the killing of his father he has been seen by
three forensic psychiatrists. All received similar histories
differing only in
the amount of detail which was exacted. It should be noted that the prisoner
had been using marijuana because he
claimed it had a calming effect upon
him.
<P>

25	Dr Olav Nielssen has now seen the prisoner on at least four occasions in his
capacity as a visiting psychiatrist at Long Bay.
When he first saw the prisoner
on 28 July 1998 he concluded that the prisoner was acutely mentally ill at the
time of the offence
with a relapse of a psychotic illness for which he had
received treatment in the past. Dr Nielssen was of the view that the prisoner
had a defence of diminished responsibility because he had an abnormality of
mind at the time which substantially impaired his mental
responsibility for his
actions. Having seen him on a number of occasions Dr Nielssen has detected a
distinct improvement in the prisoner's
mental state following treatment. Dr
Nielssen felt as of 17 February this year that his psychiatric diagnosis is
probably schizoaffective
disorder which the doctor described as a combination
of features as bipolar and schizophrenic illnesses.
<P>

26	The prisoner has acknowledged to Dr Nielssen on his most recent visit that
he needs to abstain from taking drugs and Dr Nielssen
is of the view that when
released on parole the prisoner should receive ongoing psychiatric care
including counselling about the
effects of drug and alcohol abuse. He was
somewhat guarded as to his view as to the likelihood of the prisoner being a
danger to
the community stating that his future dangerousness would appear to
depend largely on whether or not there were relapses of psychotic
illness which
illness he felt would respond to treatment and early intervention. As I would
understand Dr Nielssen's reports he is
of the view that providing that the
prisoner is given proper psychiatric treatment his prospects for rehabilitation
are good.
<P>

27	Dr B Westmore has seen him twice. Following his first visit Dr Westmore
obtained access to both the prison medical files and
those of the Shellharbour
hospital. Having carefully reviewed those records and as a consequence of his
examinations, Dr Westmore
concluded that at the time of the commission of the
offence he was substantially impaired by abnormality of mind. It was his view
that his underlying mental condition was not of a transient type. However, he
felt he could only come to a differential diagnosis
which included the
following:
<P>

	"1.	Paranoid schizophrenia (aggravated by substance abuse).
<P>

	2.	A drug induced paranoid psychosis.
<P>

	3.	A depressive illness (chronic type) with intermittent paranoid ideation
?delusional.
<P>

	4.	A personality disorder with paranoid and possibly antisocial qualities."
<P>

28	Dr Lucas having received an extensive history and having had the opportunity
to read the reports of Dr Davies, Dr Iqbal, Dr Westmore
and Dr Nielssen agreed
with the other forensic psychiatrists that he had a defence of diminished
responsibility. He stated:
<P>

	"He was suffering from an abnormality of mind, an acute paranoid psychosis,
and major depression. The abnormality of mind was due
to disease and not of a
transitory nature. The possibilities are Mr Gunes has recurrent episodes of
major depression or has paranoid
schizophrenia with occasional exacerbations.
In my opinion, the abnormality of mind substantially impaired his mental
responsibility
for his actions. There is good evidence that his behaviour had
become erratic, out of control and perhaps irrational during the period
in
question."
<P>

29	Dr Lucas observed that his mental illness was the product of a long standing
condition and will require long term treatment.
<P>

30	The unanimity of the psychiatric view illustrates that the Crown very
properly accepted the prisoner's plea in this matter. Plainly
enough that while
his mental condition has caused eminent forensic psychiatrists difficulty in
exactly determining the nature of
his malady all are of the view that it is
profound and of long standing. All agree that he requires continuing treatment
both while
in the prison system and on parole. Indeed it may be he will require
treatment for the rest of his life. The need for continuing
treatment after his
release and obviously for a long time thereafter gives rise, in my view, to
special circumstances pursuant to
s 5(2) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a>.</b>
<P>

31	There are thus good reasons for substantially altering the proportion
between minimum and additional terms stipulated by the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></b>.
Indeed the Crown quite correctly agreed with the submission made by counsel for
the prisoner that this was so. My finding of special
circumstances will be
reflected in the structure of the sentence I am about to pass.
<P>

32	The psychiatric evidence indicates the depth of the prisoner's psychosis and
the manner in which it manifested itself at the
time of the subject incident.
Plainly enough at the time of the incident he was very substantially impaired
by his abnormality of
mind thus substantially reducing his criminal
responsibility for his actions at the time. 
<P>

33	Such was his mental state at the time of the commission of the crime that,
in my view, deterrence has very little weight indeed
in the sentencing
considerations which I have to apply in this case (see <b>Regina v
Scognamiglio</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2056%20A%20Crim%20R%2081" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 56 A Crim R 81</a> at 86). He also has, I would understand
the psychiatric reports as expressing, some contrition for his actions and I
have taken that
into account.
<P>

34	Having made these observations relating to the subjective features of the
matter, the fact remains that the horrific nature of
the offence cannot be put
aside. The homicide of a person by fire is a case so grotesque, where community
expectations call for a
term of some substance.
<P>

35	Having weighed the objective and subjective factors, I have concluded that a
head sentence of twelve years should be imposed.
Having regard to my finding of
special circumstances, I have imposed an additional term which is of greater
duration than the minimum
term I have fixed. However, the prisoner, his family
and the community should be aware that he will not necessarily be released on
parole at the completion of his minimum term.
<P>

36	While he is now, in Dr Nielssen's view, responding to treatment, it appears
from the psychiatric reports that there is a risk
that he may remain a danger,
either to himself or the community because of his underlying mental condition
and that, plainly, is
a matter which will receive anxious consideration at the
appropriate time from those who will have the task of deciding whether he
should be released on parole. No doubt the Offenders Review Board will have up
to date psychiatric assessments to assist them in
their task at that time.
<P>

37	I have backdated the sentence to the date on which the prisoner was
apprehended, namely, 3 December 1997. The head sentence of
twelve years will be
constructed as follows: a minimum term of five years commencing on 3 December
1997 and expiring on 2 December
2002 when the prisoner will be eligible for
release on parole. An additional term of seven years commencing on 3 December
2002 and
expiring on 2 December 2009.
