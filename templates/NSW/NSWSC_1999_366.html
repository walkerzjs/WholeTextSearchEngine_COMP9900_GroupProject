12711/98	<b>LEESA WATERS   v   PACIFIC PUBLICATIONS PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  This is an appeal by way of stated case from a decision of a
magistrate in dismissing a prosecution brought by the
appellant, Leesa Waters,
against the respondent, Pacific Publications Pty Limited.  The appellant
brought the proceedings against
the respondent in her capacity as an officer of
the Department of Community Services, alleging a breach by the respondent of s
68(1)
of the <i>Children (Care and Protection) Act</i>, 1986.  (I shall refer
to that Act as "the statute".)
<P>

2	The prosecution arose from the publication by the respondent in "New Idea"
magazine of an article naming a child in respect of
whom there had been
proceedings under Pt 5 of the statute.
<P>

3	A copy of the article was annexed to the stated case. The article was
published on 5 July 1997, and it was seemingly based upon
an interview with the
child's mother, quoting constantly from this source.  The article related to
events eleven years previously
when the person interviewed had been involved in
a marital dispute with her husband.  It appears from the article that on 8 July
1986 the husband shot and killed his mother-in-law, wounded his father-in-law,
and held the child of the marriage as a hostage. 
He was subsequently
imprisoned and the article referred to the impact of his criminal behaviour
upon the child's mother, who feared
for the safety of the child and herself
when the father was released from prison, and the trauma of the mother's
separation from
her child, who, the article disclosed, <i>"was placed in foster
care"</i> at some time subsequent to the events in 1986.
<P>

4	The facts as found by the magistrate are recorded in para 2 of the stated
case, although I substitute initials for the full names
set out:
<P>

	<i>"On or about 5 July 1997 the respondent published in New Idea magazine an
article entitled `P's Story:  "He killed my mum... and now
he's after me"'.
Included in the published article was the name of RM (`R'), who is a child to
whom Part 5 of the Act related.  The
article published by the respondent also
contained the following details:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	That R's father had shot her grandmother during a siege on 8 July 1986
in which R was taken hostage by her father.</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	That R's mother, PM, found it increasingly difficult to look after R
after the shooting and that R had been placed in foster
care.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	That R's mother, PM, suffered a breakdown and `turned to alcohol to
ease her depression'.  The article quotes PM as stating
`when R was taken away,
it broke my heart.  I want her back desperately.  I speak to her every week, it
is the moment I live for.
 I've tried to get her back, but it is now up to
her'.</i>
<P>

<i>	(iv)	That PM has received threats from R's father who is still in gaol and
`the foster family caring for R has also received threats
but they also aren't
prepared to speak'.</i>
<P>

<i>	(v)	A note at the end of the article stated that `the NSW Department of
Community Service says it is unable to comment to protect
the identity of some
of the individuals involved'.</i>
<P>

<i>	In addition to the published words there were photographs of R as a baby
with her mother and recent photograph of PM.  The article
was tendered in the
proceedings and marked exhibit 1.  A copy of that article is annexed and marked
`A'.</i>
<P>

<i>	There was no specific reference in the article to the actual care
proceedings involving R."</i>
<P>

5	The magistrate upheld a submission by the respondent at the conclusion of the
appellant's case that no prima facie case had been
established, stating the
grounds of that decision in para 3 of the stated case:
<P>

	<i>"1.	To establish an offence pursuant to s 68(1) of the Act the prosecution
must establish that at the time of publication of the article
the
respondent:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	knew that there had been care proceedings or proceedings under Part 5
of the Act concerning the child; and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	that the article would identify that child in connection with those
proceedings.</i>
<P>

<i>	The grounds for that determination were:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	There is no legislative intention to exclude knowledge or intention
demonstrated;</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	The available penalty of imprisonment indicates the seriousness of the
offence; and</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	The context of s 68 in the Act indicates that it is not a regulatory
type offence.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	Section 68(1)(a) of the Act only prohibits the publication or
broadcasting of a child's name in relation to proceedings under
Part 5 of the
Act, that is, in the present circumstances in relation to care proceedings in
the Children's Court.  The publication
by a person of information about
themselves, some or all of which information has been put before a Court in
care proceedings, does
not breach s 68 of the Act.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	On the evidence the prosecution has not established:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	the requisite knowledge or intent referred to in (1);</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	that the article published or broadcast the child's name in relation to
proceedings under Part 5 of the Act."</i>
<P>

6	The appellant contends that the decision reached by the magistrate involved
error of law because:
<P>

(i)	section 68(1) of the statute did not require proof of mens rea or guilty
mind;
<P>

(ii)	an offence was proved against the sub-section once the child was named in
the article and was connected in it with the subject
matter of relevant
proceedings under the statute.
<P>

7	Section 68 provides:
<P>

	<i>"(1) 	</i><cite>The name of any child</cite><i>:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)  	who appears as a witness before the Children's Court in any
proceedings under this Part,</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)  	</i><cite>to whom any proceedings under this Part relate</cite><i>,
or</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)  	who is mentioned or otherwise involved in any proceedings under this
Part,</i>
<P>

<i>	</i><cite>shall not be published</cite><i> or broadcast, </i><cite>whether
before or after the proceedings are disposed of</cite><i>.</i>
<P>

<i>	(2) 	Any person who publishes or broadcasts the name of any child the
publication or broadcasting of which is prohibited by subsection
(1) is guilty
of an offence.</i>
<P>

<i>	(3) Subsection (1) does not prohibit:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)  	the publication or broadcasting of an official report of the
proceedings of the Children's Court that includes the name of
any child the
publication or broadcasting of which would otherwise be prohibited by
subsection (1), or</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)  	the publication or broadcasting of the name of a child:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)  	in the case of a child who is under the age of 16 years at the time
of publication or broadcasting with the consent of the
Children's Court,
or</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii) 	in the case of a child who is of or above the age of 16 years at the
time of publication or broadcasting with the consent of
the child.</i>
<P>

<i>	(4) 	For the purposes of this section, a reference to the name of a child
includes a reference to any information, picture or other
material that
identifies the child or is likely to lead to the identification of the
child."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>(Emphasis added)
<P>

8	The crux of the offence alleged against the respondent was that it published
the name of the child to whom proceedings under Pt
5 of the statute related.
<P>

9	Section 120 of the statute provides for punishment of an offence against s
68(1) by way of monetary penalty and/or imprisonment
for a period not exceeding
twelve months.
<P>

10	Before considering the competing submissions, it is desirable to examine the
statutory context in which s 68 is to be found.
<P>

11	As its name would indicate, the statute is concerned with the care and
protection of children.  The statute is divided into a
number of Parts, all of
which reflect such statutory concern.  I need not review the detail of the
earlier Parts of the statute,
but it is to be noted that Pt 3 deals inter alia
with fostering, and that a child may be placed in foster care with the approval
of the Minister or the Director General.  Section 68 is located in Pt 5 which
concerns "children in need of care", a class earlier
defined in Pt 1 in s 10.
Division 2 of Pt 5 provides for care applications which are to be dealt with in
the Children's Court.  Section
72, found in Div 4 of Pt 5, defines the powers
and obligations of the Children's Court in respect of children in need of care.
Section
72 expresses the type of orders that the court may make on a care
application.
<P>

12	It is Div 3 of Pt 5 which is of particular significance for present
purposes.  It makes provisions for the conduct of hearings
in the Children's
Court and s 68 is in this Division.  Section 65 provides for rights of
appearance in proceedings under Pt 5 and
s 67 provides for control of those who
may attend the hearing of proceedings.  The section empowers the court to
exclude persons.
 Because of its significance for present purposes, I record s
67:
<P>

	<i>"(1) 	While the Children's Court is hearing proceedings under this Part
with respect to a child:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	any person (other than a person referred to in paragraph (b)) who is
not directly interested in the proceedings shall, unless
the Children's Court
otherwise directs, be excluded from the place where the proceedings are being
heard, and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	any person who is engaged in preparing a report on the proceedings for
dissemination through a public news medium shall, unless
the Children's Court
otherwise directs, be entitled to enter and remain in the place where the
proceedings are being heard.</i>
<P>

<i>	(2) 	While the Children's Court is hearing proceedings under this Part with
respect to a child:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)  	the Children's Court may direct the child to leave the place where
the proceedings are being heard at any time during the proceedings
if it is of
the opinion that the prejudicial effect of excluding the child is outweighed by
the psychological harm that is likely
to be occasioned to the child if the
child is allowed to remain there, and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)  	the Children's Court may direct any person (other than the child) to
leave the place where the proceedings are being heard
at any time during the
examination of any witness if it is of the opinion that it is in the interests
of the child that such a direction
should be given.</i>
<P>

<i>	(3) 	The powers exercisable by the Children's Court under subsection (2)
(b) may be exercised even if the person to whom a direction
under that
paragraph is given is directly interested in the proceedings.</i>
<P>

<i>	(4) 	If the Children's Court gives a direction under subsection (2)(a) with
respect to a child, it shall also give a direction under
subsection (2)(b) with
respect to all persons who are engaged in preparing reports of the proceedings
for dissemination through a
public news medium."</i>
<P>

13	Sections 69-71 are directed at procedural matters in relation to proceedings
under Pt 5 and I need not express the detail of
those provisions.
<P>

14	The above statutory review suffices for present purposes and I now turn to
consider the first of the matters argued, namely whether
to establish an
offence against s 68(1) it was incumbent upon the prosecution to prove guilty
knowledge, in the sense of an awareness
that there had been care proceedings
under Pt 5 of the statute.
<P>

15	Mr Saidi, on behalf of the appellant, submitted that having regard to the
subject matter of the statute, and the particular subject
matter of s 68, it
was not incumbent on the appellant to prove mens rea in the circumstances of
the publication.  He submitted that
the section was analogous to a statutory
provision relating to public health or public safety.  He also relied upon the
absence of
any expression in s 68 that conveyed a need to prove knowledge or
intention.  It sufficed, Mr Saidi argued, to prove an intention
to publish the
article and that intention was, of course, proved by the circumstances of the
publication itself.
<P>

16	Mr Saidi invited reference to the law of contempt by publication, which, he
submitted, was analogous.  There lack of intent to
prejudice court proceedings
was no defence once a publication was proved to have interfered with a fair
trial:  see <b><i>Borrie &amp; Lowe The Law of Contempt</i></b>, 3rd ed., p 89;
and <b><i>Attorney General for New South Wales v Radio 2UE &amp; Ors</i></b>
(unreported, NSWCA, 28 August 1992, and in particular the judgment of Priestley
JA at 37-38).
<P>

17	Whether guilty knowledge in a person charged with a criminal offence is a
necessary ingredient has been the subject of what Wilson
J described as <i>"a
bewildering diversity of judicial opinions expressed generally over the past
century"</i>:  see <b><i>He Kaw Teh v The Queen</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 43</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20157%20CLR%20523" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 157 CLR 523</a> at
549.
<P>

18	The need to prove mens rea at common law was expressed by Jordan CJ in
<b><i>R v Turnbull</i></b> (1944) 44 SR 108 at 109:
<P>

	<i>"...assuming [a person's] mind to be sufficiently normal for him to be
capable of criminal responsibility, it is also necessary at
common law for the
prosecution to prove that he knew that he was doing the criminal act which is
charged against him, that is that
he knew that all the facts constituting the
ingredients necessary to make the act criminal were involved in what he was
doing.  If
this be established, it is no defence that he did not know that the
act which he was consciously doing was forbidden by law.  Ignorance
of the law
is no excuse."</i>
<P>

19	Sir Frederick Jordan's statement of principle was approved in <b><i>He Kaw
Teh</i></b> (at pp 531 and 572).
<P>

20	However, as the dicta of Wilson J earlier cited emphasises, guilty knowledge
has not always been regarded as a necessary element
in establishing a statutory
offence.  Indeed, in <b><i>Proudman v Dayman</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1941/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1941] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281943%29%2067%20CLR%20536" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1943) 67 CLR 536</a> at 540
Dixon J remarked upon 
<P>

	<i>"a marked and growing tendency to treat the prima facie rule [that is
against strict liability] as excluded or rebutted in the case
of summary
offences created by modern statutes, particularly those dealing with social and
industrial regulation."</i>
<P>

21	His Honour went on to say:
<P>

	<i>"There may be no longer any presumption that mens rea, in the sense of a
specific state of mind, whether of motive, intention, knowledge
or advertence,
is an ingredient in an offence created by a modern statute..."</i>
<P>

22	In <b><i>Proudman</i></b> s 30 of the South Australian <i>Road <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ta77/" class="autolink_findacts">Traffic
Act</a></i> called for consideration.  It created an offence of permitting a person
to drive a motor vehicle without a licence.  It was held
that the section did
not require proof on a prosecution that the defendant knew the driver to whom
the car was entrusted had no licence.
<P>

23	<b><i>R v Walker</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2077%20A%20Crim%20R%20236" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 77 A Crim R 236</a> is a recent decision, again
concerning a breach of a motor traffic act, in which it was held that it was
unnecessary to prove a wilful
and volitional refusal to undertake a breath
analysis test in order to prove a charge of failing to submit to a breath
analysis under
s 4E of the <i>Motor Traffic Act </i>(New South Wales).
<P>

24	I should refer also to <b><i>Sweet v Parsley</i></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1969/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1969] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%20AC%20132" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] AC 132</a> and in
particular to the speech of Lord Diplock at 163:
<P>

	<i>"Where penal provisions are of general application to the conduct of
ordinary citizens in the course of their every day life the presumption
is that
the standard of care required of them in informing themselves of facts which
would make their conduct unlawful, is that of
the familiar common law duty of
care.  But where the subject-matter of a statute is the regulation of a
particular activity involving
potential danger to public health, safety or
morals in which citizens have a choice as to whether they participate or not,
the court
may feel driven to infer an intention of Parliament to impose by
penal sanctions a higher duty of care on those who choose to participate
and to
place upon them an obligation to take whatever measures may be necessary to
prevent the prohibited act..."</i>
<P>

25	However in <b><i>He Kaw Teh</i></b> (supra) the common law presumption as to
guilty knowledge being an element in an offence was firmly recognised:  see the
judgments
of Gibbs CJ at 528; of Brennan J at 565-567; and of Dawson J at
591-592.
<P>

26	I understand the contemporary position to be as was stated in <b><i>Griffin
v Marsh</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2034%20NSWLR%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 34 NSWLR 104</a> at 107-108.  Hunt CJ at CL said:
<P>

	<i>"It was accepted by all parties that the relevant law is to be found stated
in He Kaw Teh v The Queen <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 43</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20157%20CLR%20523" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 157 CLR 523</a> at 529-530, 567-568, 594-595, in
Von Lieven v Stewart (at 66) and in Hawthorne (Department of Health) v Morcam
Pty Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2029%20NSWLR%20120" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 29 NSWLR 120</a> at 131.  It is sufficient for present purposes to
state that law in two propositions:</i>
<P>

<i>	(1)	The common law presumption is that an essential ingredient of every
offence is that the defendant knew of the wrongfulness of
his act unless the
statute excludes that presumption either expressly or by necessary
implication.</i>
<P>

<i>	(2)	In determining whether the common law presumption has been displaced in
the particular case, regard should be had to:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	the words of the statute itself;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the subject matter with which the statute deals; and</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	whether an absolute liability will assist in overcoming the mischief at
which the statute is aimed.</i>
<P>

<i>	As Gibbs CJ remarked in He Kaw Teh's case (at 530), these indicators do not
always point in the same direction."</i>
<P>

27	Returning to the present case, has the presumption recognised in the first
of the propositions stated in the above passage from
<b><i>Griffin </i></b>been
excluded by any one of the matters identified in the above expression of
principle?
<P>

28	The legislature has not expressed an intention to do away with the
presumption in the language employed in s 68.  That being
so, has it done so by
necessary implication? I do not find in s 68, or elsewhere in the statute,
language which either expressly
or by necessary implication excludes the
relevant presumption.
<P>

29	Section 67 contemplates that proceedings under Pt 5 may attract media
interest.  Hence a representative of the media is to be
permitted to hear the
proceedings, (s 67(1)(b)), unless excluded from the hearing under that
sub-section or under s 67(2)(b).  A
representative of the media or, indeed, any
person publishing or broadcasting in relation to care proceedings <i>"whether
before or after the proceedings [were] disposed of",</i> would generally be
expected to have the guilty knowledge associated with the publication or
broadcast in contravention of s 68(1)
by reason of his very conduct.  In the
present case the magistrate found no specific reference in the article to the
care proceedings
under Pt 5, and it was not apparent that the respondent was
aware such proceedings had occurred.  However, putting to one side the
present
case, the very purpose and expression of a publication or broadcast
contemplated in s 68(1) would generally be indicative
of guilty knowledge in
the publisher or broadcaster.  Assuming an inadvertent publishing or broadcast
though it is difficult to see
why the common law presumption should have been
intended to have been displaced.
<P>

30	The statute has in s 67 recognised the community interest in responsible
reporting of proceedings in the Children's Court under
Pt 5 of the statute.
Whilst a child's interests require that such community interest be restricted
so that the child is not identified
in a report on such proceedings, it does
not seem to me that the balancing of identified competing interests calls for
the rebuttal
of the presumption of guilty knowledge as an element in an offence
of publication under s 68.
<P>

31	I am unable to find in the subject matter of s 68, or in the statute
generally, a reason for the displacement of the common law
presumption
confirmed in <b><i>He Kaw Teh</i></b>.  
<P>

32	Nor does it seem to me that an absolute liability under s 68 would assist in
avoiding the mischief towards which the section
is directed.
<P>

33	I add that facilitation of the task of prosecution for an offence under s 68
should not, and would not, rebut the common law
presumption.  To this effect
Brennan J in <b><i>He Kaw Teh</i></b> said at 580:
<P>

	<i> "A pragmatic concern about unmeritorious acquittals does not warrant the
imposition of strict liability."</i>
<P>

34	I consider that the wrongfulness of the publisher's act is a necessary
ingredient in an offence under s 68.  It was not contended
by the appellant
that there was prima facie evidence of such guilty knowledge placed before the
magistrate and it follows that, in
my opinion, the decision of the magistrate
was correct.
<P>

35	I will deal nevertheless with the second ground argued by the appellant as
amounting to an error of law by the magistrate.
<P>

36	Mr Saidi submitted that a breach of s 68 was established upon proof of the
following matters:
<P>

(i)	that the person identified was a child;
<P>

(ii)	that there was identification by name or in some other manner (in this
case, of course, the child was named in the article);
<P>

(iii)	that there were proceedings under Pt 5 relating to her;
<P>

(iv)	that the child was named or identified sufficiently in connection with the
subject matter of such proceedings.
<P>

37	Mr Saidi further submitted that each of the elements (i) to (iv) had been
established.
<P>

38	The critical and contentious element was element (iv) above.  Mr Saidi
submitted that element was proved by reference to the
following assertions in
the article:
<P>

(a)	that the child R was placed in foster care;
<P>

(b)	the statement attributed in the article to the mother:
<P>

	<i>"When R was taken away it broke my heart.  I want her back
desperately."</i>
<P>

(c)	that <i>"the foster family caring for R has also received
threats..."</i>
<P>

(d)	the footnote to the article:
<P>

	<i>"The New South Wales Department of Community Services says it is unable to
comment to protect the identity of some of the individuals
involved."</i>
<P>

39	These submissions did not, of course, find favour in the court below, and
the magistrate found that while the article identified
the child it did not
identify the child in connection with care proceedings under Pt 5.  In my
opinion, that determination did not
involve any error of law.  I accept Mr
Hale's submission that the question as to whether or not a child the subject of
care proceedings
under Pt 5 has been named in connection with such proceedings
is to be determined by reference to the article itself.
<P>

40	Obviously, it cannot have been the intention of the legislature to make it
an offence simply to publish the name of a child who
has been involved in
proceedings under Pt 5.  Taken out of context and taken literally, sub-s (1)
would permit of such a construction.
 However, s 68 has to be considered in its
context and in particular in conjunction with s 67, the terms of which I set
out earlier.
 Mr Hale submitted that s 68 must be regarded as being directed to
the publishing or broadcasting of a report of the proceedings.
 This would
include reporting on the evidence placed before the Children's Court, the
submissions made to that court and what the
magistrate determined.  
<P>

41	Mr Hale further submitted that the prohibition on publishing or broadcasting
the name of the child to whom proceedings related
presupposed that the
proceedings themselves were being published or broadcast by some report of the
nature I have identified.
<P>

42	In my opinion, Mr Hale is correct in that submission.  
<P>

43	Section 67(1)(b) focuses upon <i>"any person who is engaged in preparing a
report on the proceedings for dissemination through a public news medium"</i>.
It is implicit that the legislature had such a person in mind in imposing the
restriction against publishing or broadcasting in
s 68(1), although s 68(2)
does not limit the restriction to members of the media.  However, it seems to
me that, construed in context,
s 68 is plainly directed at a report in relation
to proceedings under Pt 5.  In respect of any such report the child is not to
be
identified unless s 68(3) applies.
<P>

44	I do not consider that s 68(1) is to be given such a broad construction as
to create an offence in the case of a publication
where, as the magistrate here
found, there was no specific reference to the care proceedings under Pt 5.
<P>

45	Strictly speaking, the stated case has not expressly posed a question or
questions for decision by this Court.  However, the
issues have been clearly
identified in the stated case and have been addressed by counsel in their
comprehensive and helpful submissions.
Plainly the question posed for this
Court is whether the determination of the magistrate was erroneous in point of
law.  Having considered
the two areas of challenge to which Mr Saidi directed
his submissions, I answer the question in the negative.
<P>

46	Accordingly, I order the appellant to pay the respondent's costs.
<P>
