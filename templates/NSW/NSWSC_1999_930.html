<P>

<b><u>NGUYEN    V.    PERRI &amp; ANOR.</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The plaintiff is the lessee of a hot bread shop from the
defendants Mr. and Mrs. Perri under an agreement for lease for five
years from
14th October 1998, arising from the exercise of an option under an earlier
lease.  In these proceedings, the plaintiff
seeks declarations as to her
entitlement to use a passageway adjacent to the shop, a yard at the rear of the
shop, and a coolroom
in that yard, and also consequential relief.  She also
seeks relief concerning a roller-shutter door, and $3,531.39 paid in respect
of
garbage removal and a grease trap.  There is now no issue between the parties
concerning the coolroom and the roller-shutter door.
 
<P>

<b><u>OUTLINE OF FACTS</u></b>
<P>

2  	I will commence with an outline of the facts which are not
substantially in dispute.
<P>

3  	Prior to early 1992, the defendants conducted a bakery business
in the subject shop, and also owned the property on which that
shop and four
other shops were erected.  
<P>

4  	On 19th March 1992, the plaintiff entered into a lease of this
shop from the defendants for one year, with an option for a further
three
years.  It appears that she also purchased bakery machinery and equipment from
the defendants for $90,000.00 or thereabouts.
 
<P>

5  	The lease provided for a minimum annual rent of $41,600.00.  The
permitted use of the premises, set out in No.15 of the Lease
Schedule, was "hot
bread shop".  Other relevant terms of the lease were cls.7(1) and 7(4)(a), 8(1)
and 8(5), 12, 17, 20 and 24. 
These provisions were in the following terms:

<P>

<b><i>2.	The Lessee hereby covenants with the Lessor that the rights granted in
this clause are granted subject to the regulations and rules

<P>

6  	In 1993, the parties entered into a further lease of the shop for
a term of five years commencing 14th October 1993, with a
five year option.
This lease contained relevantly similar terms.  
<P>

7  	In 1994, with the permission of the lessors, the plaintiff had
the glass shopfront removed and replaced with a roller-shutter
door.  
<P>

8  	On 20th January 1997, the defendants' solicitors wrote to the
plaintiff claiming that breaches of the lease had occurred, including
the
removal of the plate-glass shopfront without the lessors' approval, erecting a
shed at the rear of the premises, and selling
milk and soft drinks.  Further
letters from the defendants' solicitors to the plaintiff of 13th February 1997
and 23rd April 1997
asserted that these breaches were continuing.  A further
letter from the defendants' solicitors to the plaintiff of 29th May 1997
asserted that no response had been received to the previous letters.
<P>

9  	A further letter from the defendants' solicitors to the plaintiff
dated 10th November 1997 made similar complaints, and also
asserted that the
plaintiff had obstructed the passageway beside the shop.  Another letter from
the defendants' solicitors to the
plaintiff of 16th February 1998 repeated
these complaints, and asserted that the plaintiff had placed bins in the yard
behind the
shop and taken possession of the passageway for storage of sacks.

<P>

10  	On 18th April 1998, the plaintiff exercised the option contained
in the five year lease.  
<P>

11  	On 27th April 1998, a lease of adjoining shops for the period
16th March 1998 to 15th March 2002 was executed by the defendants
and a Mr.
Taylor and two other persons.  It has been asserted by Mr. Perri that that
lease included the yard behind the plaintiff's
shop; but as I understand it,
the submissions on behalf of the defendants concede that the yard is a common
area under that lease,
as well as being a common area under the plaintiff's
lease.  
<P>

12  	On 1st May 1998, the defendants' solicitors wrote to the
plaintiff's solicitors alleging that the plaintiff was in breach of
the lease,
and that the defendants did not agree to grant a further term.  
<P>

13  	By letter dated 29th June 1998 from the plaintiff's solicitors
to the defendants' solicitors, it was asserted inter alia that
the defendants
had consented to the installation of the roller-shutter door, that a "removable
container" (apparently, the shed complained
about by the defendants) had been
removed, and that the defendants themselves had sold milk and soft drinks.  
<P>

14  	On 22nd July 1998, the defendants' solicitors wrote to the
plaintiff's solicitors alleging inter alia "Our client denies any
conversation
with your client and any agreement to remove the shopfront plate-glass and
install a rollerdoor in lieu thereof".  This
letter repeated that the
defendants were not prepared to grant a further lease.  
<P>

15  	On 12th August 1998, the rent for the month of August was posted
to Mr. Perri at 4 Coolangatta Avenue, Cronulla, 2230, which
had been the
defendants' address.  This letter was returned to sender.  On 3rd September
1998, it was sent on by the plaintiff's
solicitors to the defendants'
solicitors.  It appears that the defendants had moved house, and not notified
the plaintiff.  
<P>

16  	By letter dated 7th September 1998, the plaintiff's solicitors
pointed out to the defendants' solicitors that they could not
rely on breaches
to refuse a new lease, in circumstances where no notice under s.133E of the
Conveyancing Act had been served.  By
a letter dated 28th September 1998, the
defendants' solicitors notified that the defendants agreed to grant a further
lease, claiming
a rental of $26,000.00 per annum.  
<P>

17  	By a letter dated 1st October 1998, the plaintiff's solicitors
requested determination of a market rent; and by a letter dated
5th November
1998, they enclosed a valuation of $13,000.00 per annum.  
<P>

18  	On 3rd December 1998, the defendants' solicitors wrote advising
that the next day their clients would attend the premises and
remove
obstructions.  The plaintiff's solicitors replied by a letter of the same day
in the following terms:
<P>

<b><i>We refer to your facsimile of the 3rd instant and are instructed to
advise as follows:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>1.	Our client has long ceased from using the yard for storage;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>2.	Flour has been stored on part of the passage since your clients first
commenced the business at the premises.  Such practice was
passed on to our
client when the business was leased to our client.  Your clients are aware that
if there is no such storage area
the premises could not be leased as a
bakery;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>3.	Our client's past attitude towards her obligations under the lease has
been nothing but complied with the provisions of the lease.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>4.	Your clients have tried all tactics which they could imagine in order
to take the business back.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>5.	Our client still await (sic) refund of the outgoing charge.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Please TAKE NOTICE that your clients will be held liable for any damage
if the threat is carried out and any attempt to physically
remove the flour
will be considered as violation of our client's right and will be physically
defended accordingly.</i></b>
<P>

19  	On 9th December 1998, the defendants' solicitors wrote again,
inter alia demanding that the shopfront be replaced within fourteen
days.  On
10th December 1998, Mr. Perri and two others attended at the shop, removed
flour stored in the passageway and stacked it
on the footpath in front of the
shop, and also placed a garbage bin and recycle sack from the yard behind the
shop on the footpath.
<P>

20  	By letter dated 22nd December 1998, the plaintiff's solicitors
wrote to the defendants' solicitors in the following terms:
<P>

<b><i>We refer to earlier correspondence in this matter and now enclose a draft
Summons.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>We draw your attention to interlocutory Orders 11 and 12.  Unless we have
your written undertaking on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Perri
by 1.00pm on 23
December, 1998 that pending the Christmas period (i.e., until Monday 11
January, 1999) your clients will not:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>1.	interfere with our client's use of the passage-way immediately
adjacent to the demised premises for the purposes of storage of
flour;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>2.	interfere with our client's use of the yard at the rear of the demised
premises for storage of rubbish and recyclable material
on a weekly basis until
the collection of it by the Council;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>3.	attempt to interfere with the roller-shutter door at the front of the
demised premises as outlined in your letter dated 9 December,
1998.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>We are instructed to approach the Duty Judge in Equity on Thursday 24
December, 1998 for an injunction in terms set out in interlocutory
Orders 11
and 12 of the Summons.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>Given the Christmas period, it would appear sensible for the parties to
have a "cooling-off" period over Christmas and not unnecessarily
waste money
and Court time seeking interlocutory relief over Christmas.  It may be that by
11 January, 1999, the parties can resolve
the situation.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>If you are instructed not to provide the undertakings requested, please
advise whether you have instructions to accept service of
the Summons and
Affidavit.</i></b>
<P>

21  	It appears that no undertaking was received, and these
proceedings were commenced on 24th December 1998.  
<P>

22  	It appears that between 2nd November 1994 and 26th August 1998,
the plaintiff made a number of payments in respect of garbage
collection
amounting to $2,274.00, and clearing out of a grease-trap amounting to
$1,096.74.  There is also evidence that in early
1996, the plaintiff paid
$160.65 for water rates, following a statement by Mr. Perri to the plaintiff
that if this was not paid,
the Water Board would cut off the water.  
<P>

<b><u>ISSUES</u></b>
<P>

23  	It is first necessary to resolve some factual issues in the
case, in particular as to what was the practice of the defendants,
immediately
prior to the plaintiff's taking over the business, in relation to the storage
of flour and the placement of garbage bins;
and what room there was inside the
shop, then and more recently, for the storage of flour and the placement of
garbage bins.  In
relation to those questions, it will be necessary to say
something about the credibility of the plaintiff and Mr. Perri.  
<P>

24  	The next issue concerns the entitlement of the plaintiff in
relation to the passageway beside the shop and the yard behind
it.  It is
common ground that these are "common areas" within the plaintiff's agreement
for lease, but the plaintiff claims entitlement
to use them pursuant to a
partly implied term of the lease and on the basis of estoppel.  
<P>

25  	Finally, there is the claim for moneys paid.  
<P>

<b><u>FACTUAL ISSUES</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>Evidence</u></b>
<P>

26  	The plaintiff gave evidence to the effect that, immediately
prior to her taking over the shop business, the defendants, in
the conduct of
their business, stored flour in the passageway beside the shop.  She also gave
evidence that, then as now, there was
no place in the interior of the shop in
which flour could be stored.  She said that, in paying for the machinery and
equipment and
entering into the lease of the shop, she relied on the conduct of
the defendants and on being able to continue in the same manner
in her own
business.  She also gave evidence that the defendants, immediately before she
took over the shop, had a garbage bin and
sack in the yard at the rear; and
that she relied on this practice also.  She said that, due to increased
business, the use of flour
had increased from about 35-40 bags per week to
about 75-80 bags per week.
<P>

27  	The plaintiff gave evidence through an interpreter, and it is
plain that her ability to speak or even understand English is
very limited.  It
is also clear that all conversations between the plaintiff and Mr. Perri were
in fact conducted on her behalf by
her husband.  However, the plaintiff's
husband gave no evidence on the matters to which I have just referred.  The
plaintiff's husband
and son gave evidence only concerning the circumstances of
payments made for garbage removal and to the Water Board.  
<P>

28  	Evidence was given by Mrs. Whitehead, an employee of the
defendants in 1991 and 1992, who also lives adjacent to the passageway
beside
the shop.  She confirmed that the defendants did store flour in the passageway,
but also gave evidence that some flour bags
were kept inside the shop.  She was
unable to give a precise account of quantities and times.  Evidence was also
given by Mr. Williams,
who resides in the house opposite the shop.  He
confirmed that the defendants stored flour in the passageway, at least to the
extent
of saying that he saw deliveries of flour being stacked there, and that
occasionally he saw flour in the passageway in the afternoon
when he came home
from work.
<P>

29  	Mr. Perri gave evidence that, in the defendant's conduct of the
business, there was no storage of flour in the passageway,
except that, when a
delivery of flour was made, it was left in the passageway for a short time
until it could be moved inside the
shop.  His evidence was that the business
used about 20-25 bags of flour per week, and that there was room for storage of
that amount
of flour inside the shop.  The flour was moved from the passageway
into the shop within two hours of being delivered.  Mr. Perri
also denied that
a garbage bin was kept in the backyard:  he claimed that, in his conduct of the
business, the only garbage container
was kept inside the shop.  Mr. Perri also
gave evidence that, although there had been a lockable door between the
passageway and
the street while the defendants were conducting the business, a
lockable door between the passageway and the yard had been added
without the
defendants' consent during the plaintiff's conduct of the business.  This was
contradicted by Mrs. Whitehead, who said
that this door had been there during
the defendants' conduct of the business.  
<P>

30  	One of the lessees of the adjoining shop, Mr. Taylor, swore an
affidavit asserting complaints concerning the plaintiff's use
of the backyard
and passageway.  However, in his oral evidence Mr. Taylor said he had not given
instructions for the preparation
of that affidavit, that he did not read it
beyond the first page, that he signed it under some pressure, and that in fact
he had
not complained to Mr. Perri about those matters.  
<P>

31  	No evidence for the defendants was led from Mrs. Perri.  
<P>

<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

32  	I find that I am unable to rely with any confidence on the
evidence of either the plaintiff or of Mr. Perri.  
<P>

33  	As regards the plaintiff, she gave evidence that the equipment
along the side of the shop adjacent to the passageway had not
been moved
towards the back of the shop.  In my opinion, it is clear beyond argument that,
prior to the installation of two refrigerators
by the plaintiff, the main oven
was very close to the plate-glass shopfront:  see for example photograph A of
Exhibit D5  In my opinion,
it is very clear that, as a result of the
installation of the refrigerators, that oven has been moved towards the rear.
This is also
consistent with there being a place for storage of flour bags
inside the shop, near the door at the rear of the shop, at the time
when Mr.
and Mrs. Perri were running the business.  That there was such a storage area
is confirmed by Mrs. Whitehead's evidence,
and also by a plan showing the
layout of the interior at the time equipment was installed.  In my opinion, the
plaintiff's evidence
that there was no storage space for flour whatsoever
inside the shop at the time she took it over, and her evidence that the
equipment
was not moved towards the back of the shop, is either deliberately
false or shows such a lack of recollection and understanding as
to throw the
whole of her evidence into question.  
<P>

34  	As regards Mr. Perri, he admitted that the allegation in his
solicitor's letter that there had been no conversation and no
agreement about
the removal of the glass shopfront and the installation of a roller-door was
false.  He gave no explanation as to
how such a false allegation came to be
made on his behalf, in the course of many letters, all of which required
removal of the roller-door.
 In my opinion also, the circumstances of his
obtaining of the affidavit from Mr. Taylor, alleging complaints by Mr. Taylor
which
Mr. Taylor, in his oral evidence, denies making, counts heavily against
Mr. Perri's credibility.  Also, in my opinion his evidence
about keeping the
garbage bin inside the shop was false, probably deliberately so:  it is highly
improbable, and also contradicted
by Mrs. Whitehead.  And his evidence about
the door between the passageway and the yard is false, and at least confirms
unreliability.
<P>

35  	I am satisfied by the plan to which I referred, and the evidence
of Mrs. Whitehead, that there was a space for flour storage
near the rear door
of the shop; and it seems that up to about thirty bags of flour could have been
stored there.  I am satisfied
that this facility for storage was eliminated
when the refrigerators were installed at the front of the shop and equipment
was moved
along the side wall towards the back of the shop. 
<P>

36  	While I give little weight to Mr. Perri's evidence, I am not
satisfied by the evidence called for the plaintiff that Mr. and
Mrs. Perri used
the passageway for storing flour otherwise than as a temporary measure after
flour was delivered.  Mr. Williams'
evidence suggests that the flour was left
there for more than one or two hours, as Mr. Perri claims; but it is not
sufficient to
show permanent storage.  In coming to this conclusion, I am
assisted by the circumstance that the plaintiff gave false evidence that
there
was no space for storage inside the shop, and that the plaintiff's husband gave
no evidence on the matter at all.  
<P>

37  	As regards the use of the yard for garbage, I am satisfied that
there was at least a garbage bin used by Mr. and Mrs. Perri
and kept in the
yard behind the shop.
<P>

<b><u>PLAINTIFF'S ENTITLEMENT</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>Submissions</u></b>
<P>

38  	Mr. Freeman for the plaintiff referred to <u>Wilcox v.

garbage bin and recycle sack, and the use of the passageway for storing flour,
were
both continuous and apparent, at the time the plaintiff took her lease,
and also reasonably necessary for the conduct of the business.

55-250.</a>
<P>

39  	He submitted that it was not possible to have a garbage bin
inside the shop; and he referred me to the Food (General) Regulation
1997, and
in particular Regulation 32, which is in the following terms:
<P>

<b><i>32(1)	A person must not manufacture, handle or display food in such a
manner as to cause the food to be contaminated or liable to
become
contaminated.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(2)	A person who uses any premises or vehicle for the purpose of
manufacturing or handling food must cause the premises or vehicle,
the food,
any appliances used in the preparation of the food and any utensils supplied
for eating or drinking the food:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(a)	to be kept clean and free from vermin and other likely sources of
contamination, and</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(b)	to be protected from contamination by persons, dust, vermin, animals,
fumes likely to be taken up by the food (either directly
or indirectly) and
other likely sources of contamination, and</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(c)	to be kept free from foul odours.</i></b>
<P>

40  	He submitted that it was not reasonable, having regard to the
dimensions of the shop, to suggest that one hundred bags of flour
could be
stored inside the shop.  Mr. Perri claimed he had stored thirty bags, and
conceded that it was not possible to store one
hundred bags in the shop.  For
the defendants to say that the plaintiff had to store all bags in the shop was
to say that the plaintiff
was not permitted to increase her business.  
<P>

41  	No complaint was made until 1997.  For five years, the plaintiff
had been using the passageway to store flour.  In those circumstances,
equity
would intervene, particularly in the light of the defendants' lack of bona
fides, as illustrated inter alia in the submission
of Mr. Taylor's evidence.
<P>

42  	Mr. Harris for the defendants submitted that <u>Wilcox v.
Richardson</u> showed that the rules about continuous and apparent easements
were only particular applications of the ordinary rules about the implication
of terms in a contract; and so were subject to the limitations discussed in
<u>BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty. Ltd. v. Shire of Hastings</u> (1977) 180 CLR
266 applied.  In this case, the terms sought to be implied were not reasonable
or necessary for business efficacy,
and they were inconsistent with express
terms of the lease, in particular, cls.17, 20 and 24.  
<P>

43  	In so far as the plaintiff relied on estoppel, no representation
was made on which an estoppel could be based.  There was no
evidence of any
oral or written representation.  Clause 12 of the lease precluded the existence
of an estoppel.  It was insufficient
that the defendants had operated their
business in a particular way.  It was irrelevant that no other tenant was in
fact complaining;
that use of the yard and passageway had continued without
objection for some time; and that there may be bad faith in the attitude
of the
defendants.  In any event, the plaintiff had exercised her option with full
knowledge that the defendants would not permit
use of the passageway and yard
other than for access.
<P>

<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

44  	It is apparent that cls.17 and 20 of the lease place the common
areas, which include the yard and the passageway, under the
control of the
defendants.  However, it is also clear that other provisions of the lease place
some limits on the control which the
defendants can exercise.  Clause 24 gives
the plaintiff the right to use common areas for access, so it is clear that the
defendants
cannot exercise their control over the common areas so as to defeat
that right.
<P>

45  	Clause 8 requires, and thus entitles, the plaintiff to use the
premises as a hot bread shop.  If, on the true construction
of that clause and
its application to the circumstances, that use involves some use of common
areas, then in my opinion cl.8 would
prevent the defendants from using their
control of the common areas to prevent that particular use.  
<P>

46  	In deciding what is involved, as a matter of construction, in
the use of the premises as a hot bread shop, it is relevant to
look both at the
way the defendants conducted the business immediately before the plaintiff took
it over, and also at what is reasonably
necessary for the conduct of that
business.  
<P>

47  	I have found that, in their conduct of the business, the
defendants had a garbage bin in the backyard, and also used the passageway
for
temporary storage of flour on the day of delivery.  In my opinion also, those
uses of those common areas can be regarded as reasonably
necessary for the
conduct of the hot bread shop.  Although Regulation 32 of the Food (General)
Regulation does not in terms require
garbage not to be kept in a room where
food is prepared, it seems clear that proper compliance with it would require
garbage to be
kept in such a room only for short periods:  any longer keeping
of garbage should be in a container away from the preparation of
food.
Similarly, having regard to the size of the shop and the activity required for
the conduct of the business, in my opinion it
is reasonably necessary to have a
place for immediate reception of flour deliveries outside the shop itself, but
under cover.  Accordingly,
in my opinion, the conduct of a hot bread shop as
contemplated by cl.8 does involve having appropriate garbage storage in the
yard
and temporary storage of flour in the passageway.
<P>

48  	In making these findings, I am not making an ad hoc implication
of terms for business efficacy, such as would require full
compliance with the
requirements of <u>BP Refinery (Westernport)</u>.  Rather, I am spelling out
what is involved in the actual terms of the lease, on their true
interpretation.  In my opinion, this
exercise is similar to that conducted by
the Court of Appeal in <u>Wilcox</u>.  
<P>

49  	However, the plaintiff claims a much wider entitlement than that
indicated by the above discussion.  The business now requires
the capacity to
store about one hundred bags of flour.  According to the plaintiff, there is no
capacity in the shop to store any
bags; and even the defendants suggest only a
previous capacity to store thirty bags.  The plaintiff claims that if she is
restricted
in the number of bags she can use, this would be to imply a term
that her business not increase.  
<P>

50  	I accept that one cannot imply a term in the lease that the
plaintiff's business not expand.  However, the plaintiff's case
depends upon
cutting down in some way the defendants' express right, given under the lease,
to control the common areas.  I have
indicated certain respects in which, in my
opinion, other terms of the lease do cut down that right.  However, I do not
think the
plaintiff's obligation and entitlement to use the premises as a hot
bread shop can cut down the defendants' right to control the
common areas to
any greater extent than indicated above.  To hold otherwise would mean that, by
expanding the business, the plaintiff
would increase her rights beyond those
actually granted by the lease.  
<P>

51  	I would also add that the evidence before me does not establish
affirmatively that the plaintiff could not store one hundred
bags of flour
inside the shop, if the refrigerators which she installed in the shop were
removed.  Although the defendants do not
now contend that the installation and
use of the refrigerators is a breach of the plaintiff's obligation to use the
premises only
as a hot bread shop, the plaintiff has not contended, nor do I
think it could be contended, that the use of the refrigerators is
necessary for
the use of the premises as a hot bread shop.  
<P>

52  	For the reasons advanced by Mr. Harris, the plaintiff cannot
improve her situation of the basis of estoppel.  In my opinion,
there is no
basis for holding that the plaintiff has any wider rights than those indicated
earlier. 
<P>

<b><u>MONEYS PAID</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>Submissions</u></b>
<P>

53  	Mr. Freeman submitted that all the payments were in respect of
outgoings, which under cl.7 of the lease were paid by the lessor,
with an
appropriate proportion then being recouped from the lessee.  There was no
agreement between the plaintiff and defendants
varying that position.  The
plaintiff had as a practical matter been compelled to pay what were in truth
debts of the defendants,
and so could recover those payments as money paid.

<P>

54  	Mr. Harris submitted that all the payments in question were in
respect of services provided peculiarly to the plaintiff, both
in relation to
the clearing out of the plaintiff's grease trap and the removal of the
plaintiff's garbage.
<P>

<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

55  	In my opinion, the payments made in respect of garbage removal
and the grease trap fall within cl.8(5) of the lease, and are
not debts which
the defendants were bound to pay.  While they might also be outgoings, even
outgoings "in respect of the property"
within cl.7, cl.7 does not in terms
impose an obligation on the lessor to pay such outgoings:  it merely provides a
mechanism for
the lessor to recoup a proportion of them.
<P>

56  	These considerations do not necessarily apply to the payment of
around $160.00 said to be for water rates.  However, I am not
satisfied that
the plaintiff has discharged her onus of proof in relation to that payment.
Having regard to the plaintiff's inability
to speak or understand English, and
my general view on the plaintiff's credibility, I am not satisfied by her
evidence that a conversation
occurred in relation to that $160.00 as set out in
her affidavit.  Furthermore, the evidence is not sufficiently clear, as to what
any such payment was for, to establish that it could not fall within
cl.8(5).
<P>

<b><u>CONCLUSION</u></b>
<P>

57  	In the result, in my opinion, the plaintiff is entitled to a
declaration that, under her agreement for lease, she is entitled
to use the
coolroom at the rear of her shop; that she is entitled to have a garbage bin
and recycling sack in the yard behind the
shop; and that she is entitled to
have flour delivered to the passageway beside the shop, provided that it does
not block the passageway
and provided that it is removed from the passageway as
soon as reasonably possible on the day of delivery.  She is also entitled
to a
declaration that she is entitled to maintain the roller-shutter door at the
front of the demised premises.  These entitlements
will continue during the
term of the plaintiff's agreement for lease.  
<P>

58  	At present, I am not minded to grant any injunction pursuant to
these declarations.  No application is made for specific performance
of the
agreement for lease, and my present view is that injunctions should be granted
only if the plaintiff alleges and proves readiness,
willingness and ability to
perform the lease on her part.  However, I am prepared to reserve liberty to
apply.
<P>

59  	As regards costs, my tentative view is that the plaintiff should
have the costs of the proceedings until the defendants conceded
her right to
use the coolroom and maintain the roller-shutter door, that is on or about 4th
August 1999.  Having regard to the limited
success of the plaintiff on other
matters, my tentative is that the plaintiff should have one-half of her costs
thereafter.
