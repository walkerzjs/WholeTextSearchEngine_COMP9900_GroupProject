<b>Friday, 29 October, 1999</b>
<P>

<b>1348/98 HELEN MARGARET REECE AS TUTOR FOR ASHLEY RICHARD REECE v PATRIA
VIROLA WARLAND - ESTATE OF THE LATE JOHN RICHARD WARLAND</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  This is an application under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision
Act</a> in respect of the estate of the late John Richard Warland who died on 30
May 1997 aged 58 years.  The deceased was survived by his
widow and various
children, step children and former wives.  The defendant, Patricia Virola
Warland, is the deceased's widow.  Under
the will of the deceased made 9 April
1997 she was appointed sole executor and trustee of the deceased and received
the whole of
his estate.
<P>

<b>Possible Eligible Persons</b>
<P>

2  	The deceased's marriage to the defendant was his fifth marriage.
The information on the earlier marriages is extremely scanty
in some cases.
His first spouse was known as 'Peggy'.  The details of when that marriage may
have occurred and that person's whereabouts
are simply not known.  There was
apparently a son, Michael, born of the relationship between the deceased and
Peggy and likewise
his whereabouts are unknown.  Nothing is known or has been
able to be led in evidence in this case of the circumstances of these
people.
<P>

3  	The deceased's second wife was Deanne Gallagher and apparently
she was married to the deceased for about ten years she and the
deceased having
been divorced in 1980.  She presently lives in Queensland and has been notified
of the proceedings.  She makes no
claim.
<P>

4  	The deceased's third wife was Sharon Prager . Apparently she and
the deceased were married for two years and divorced in 1982.
 The evidence
before me suggests that she is a member of a wealthy American family and her
whereabouts are unknown.  Accordingly,
she has not been notified of the
proceedings.
<P>

5  	The fourth wife of the deceased was Carmel Herber and there is no
information of her circumstances or her whereabouts.
<P>

6  	Danielle Warland is a daughter of the marriage between the
deceased and Deanne Gallagher.  She has been notified and makes no
claim.  Her
son, Michael John Warland, at one stage lived with the deceased and the
defendant as part of their household.  He is
now presently residing with his
grandmother, Deanne Gallagher, in Queensland.  Notice has been given to him
care of his grandmother.
<P>

7  	The deceased had a stepdaughter, Katherine Virola, who is the
daughter of the defendant.  She is presently 21 years of age and
she is living
with the defendant having lived with both the deceased and the defendant for
some time.
<P>

8  	The other child who has survived the deceased is the plaintiff,
Ashley Richard Recce.  Ashley was born on 23 November 1980.
 His mother and
tutor, Helen Margaret Recce, was employed by the deceased in the deceased's
business.  She had a sexual relationship
with the deceased from 1972 until
September or October 1980.  Ashley, her son, was conceived about seven months
before the end of
the relationship.  The deceased is shown as the father of
Ashley on Ashley's birth certificate.  Given this fact, the evidence of
the
plaintiff and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11</a> of the <b>Status</b> <b>of Children Act </b>1996 there would
seem no doubt that Ashley is the son of the deceased.
<P>

9  	Ashley was born with autism and a seizure disorder and as a
result has a severe intellectual handicap.  Evidence has been given
by his
treating paediatric neurologist, Dr Wilkinson, and it seems clear that Ashley
will need full time care for the rest of his
life.  He is also having some
treatment from a psychiatrist.  Given his IQ of 47 he is in the category of
moderate mental retardation.
 However, his autism is severe and it is clear
that he will never be able to lead an independent life.
<P>

<b>The Property in the Estate</b>
<P>

10  	I turn to deal with the assets and liabilities of the estate.
The deceased carried on business under a company known as Banlaw
Pty Ltd.  The
parties are agreed that the value of the business carried on by the company was
$224,000.  The sale of that business
is in an advanced stage of negotiation.
In addition the company owned an industrial warehouse at 17 Strathmore Road,
Caves Beach.
 There is a dispute about the value of that property the defendant
putting the value at $165,000 while the plaintiff puts it at $236,000.
 I will
return to the resolution of that dispute in due course.  The company also held
a vacant block of land in the same industrial
estate at 24 Strathmore Road,
Caves Beach which the defendant's expert values at $140,000.  In contrast, the
plaintiffs expert values
the land at $160,000.
<P>

11  	The deceased's widow and her daughter live in the deceased's
property at 29 The Esplanade, Caves Beach.  The defendant's valuer
valued this
at $400,000 and the plaintiffs valuer at $440,000. 1 will return to this
dispute in due course.
<P>

12  	The only other asset in the estate at the date of death was a
boat which has now been sold and the hire purchase contract paid
out.  In the
result there are debts in the estate in the amount of $1,887.  The estate has
incurred costs in defence of the proceedings
and those are estimated to be,
including the costs of experts in the sum of $72,507.42. The plaintiffs costs
in this matter, including
all expert's costs, which of course did include
accountancy experts until the value of the business was agreed, amount to
between
$54,924 and $64,924.  For present purposes I will assume a figure of
$60,000 for costs.
<P>

13  	There were a number of other assets which need to be discussed.
A property being a unit at 203/2-6 Burton Place, Elizabeth
Bay, Sydney, was
owned as to a one half share by the defendant as tenant in common the other
half share being held by her and the
deceased as joint tenants.  That other
half share owned by the deceased and the defendant was held as an asset in the
John Warland
Retirement Fund.  The parties are agreed that that unit has a
value of $325,000.  No claim for notional estate is made in these proceedings
and the plaintiff merely asks the court to take into account these other assets
held by the defendant when considering what is the
appropriate provision to be
made for the plaintiff.
<P>

14  	The superannuation fund has a number of assets.  One I have
already adverted to as the half interest in the unit at Elizabeth
Bay.  It also
owns some Qantas shares, office equipment and has some cash.  The total value
of the fund is $265,905 of which $162,500
is its half share of the Elizabeth
Bay unit.
<P>

<b>Chronology</b>
<P>

15  	I turn to deal with some relevant history of the matter.  The
defendant was born at Paluan in the Philippines on 17 January
1951.  She
qualified as a nurse and prior to 1987 had worked in the Philippines and Libya
as a registered nurse.  In 1988 she was
registered as a nurse in New South
Wales and worked thereafter at Concord Hospital, Mater Misericordia Hospital at
Waratah and John
Hunter Hospital in Newcastle. In 1990 the defendant commenced
to live with the deceased in a defacto relationship at the deceased's
home at
Cave Beach.  They were married on 15 August 1992.  They continued to live
together until the death of the deceased.  It appears
that the defendant knew
the deceased had suffered from some health problems and 1 will return to the
detail of this and the attention
that the defendant gave to the deceased later
in these reasons.
<P>

16  	As I have mentioned, Ashley was born on 23 November 1980.  There
were orders for maintenance for Ashley made against the deceased
at various
times.  In March 1981 he was ordered to pay $20 a week and this was increased
to $30 for a week at the end of 1982.  Ashley
was diagnosed with autism and
intellectual disability together with a seizure disorder by 1983.  In September
1991 the maintenance
for Ashley was increased to $120 per week and by 1996 he
was receiving a Disability Support Pension from the Department of Social
Security.  Throughout the period from the birth of Ashley until the deceased's
death there was little contact between the deceased
and Ashley.  He probably
saw him no more than half a dozen times and apart from one birthday he spent
little time with Ashley on
important occasions.  He supported him by paying
maintenance.  Ashley attended special schools during his schooling and in June
1998
he contracted multi resistant staphylococci aureas which prevented him
from working in a sheltered environment which he had been
doing up until this
stage.  From January 1999 Ashley has attended some post school options courses
which occupies him four days a
week between 9.30am and 3.30pm. It is unlikely
that these options will continue for more than another two years.  On 26 July
1999
the plaintiffs tutor, his mother, was also appointed by the Guardianship
Board as Ashley's financial manager and guardian.
<P>

<b>The Task of the Court</b>
<P>

17  	In applications under the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> </b>the High
Court has recently in <b>Singer v Berghouse </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a> set out the
two stage approach that a Court must take.  At page 209 it said the
following:-
<P>

"The first question is, was the provision (if any) made for the applicant
'inadequate for (his or her) proper maintenance, education
and advancement in
life'?  The difference between 'adequate' and 'proper' and the
interrelationship which exists between 'adequate
provision' and 'proper
maintenance' etc were explained in <b>Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited</b>.
The determination of the first stage in the two-stage process calls for an
assessment of whether the provision (if any) made was
inadequate or what, in
all the circumstances, was the proper level of maintenance etc appropriate for
the applicant having regard,
amongst other things, to the applicant's financial
position, the size and nature of the deceased's estate, the totality of the
relationship
between the applicant and the deceased, and the relationship
between the deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims upon
his or
her bounty.
<P>

The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves similar
considerations.  Indeed, in the first stage of the process,
the court may need
to arrive at an assessment of what is the proper level of maintenance and what
is adequate provision, in which
event, if it becomes necessary to embark upon
the second stage of the process, that assessment will largely determine the
order which
should be made in favour of the applicant.  In saying that, we are
mindful that there may be some circumstances in which a court
could refuse to
make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to have been left
without adequate provision for proper
maintenance.  Take, for example, a case
like <b>Ellis v Leeder</b> where there were no assets from which an order could
reasonably be made and making an order could disturb the testator's
arrangements
to pay creditors."
<P>

<b>The Value of the Estate</b>
<P>

18  	In order consider the situation of the relevant parties it is
necessary to have a proper appreciation, first, of the nature
of the estate.
To do this it is necessary to resolve the valuation dispute in respect of the
three properties.
<P>

17 Strathmore Road
<P>

19  	Mr Johns valued the property at $206,000 and Mr Fallon at
$165,000.  Mr Johns' valuation was done on two bases.  One was summation
taking
the land separately from the building and using that method he arrived at a
figure of $236,800.  He also capitalised what
he believed was a reasonable
current market rental of $500 per week or $26,000 per annum and arrived at a
value of $235,000.  
<P>

20  	In his report Mr Fallon was not able to give any comparable
sales and he also agreed that 11%, which had been used by Mr Johns,
would be an
appropriate capitalisation rate.  He was not able to give any details of
rentals achievable.  There was a recent sale
of a site, 29 Strathmore Road,
Caves Beach for $300,000 in March 1999.  The land area was about 1,096 square
metres which was about
twice that of the subject land.  However, the valuers
agreed that it would be inappropriate simply to arrive at a value and divide
it
by two.  Given the greater particularity of Mr Johns' evidence I propose to
accept his value of $235,000.
<P>

24 Strathmore Road
<P>

21  	This is a vacant piece of land which is in a industrial park.
Mr Johns valued it at $160,000 and Mr Fallon at $140,000.  A
number of things
stand out about it.
<P>

1.	The property has been on the market for two years at $160,000 and has not
sold.
<P>

2.	There has been a general fall in the Valuer General's base for the area
between 1 July 1995 and 1998.  The Valuer General's valuation
has fallen from
$138,000 to $102,000.
<P>

22  	In the evidence there was some debate about a fresh comparable
which was referred to by Mr Johns.  That was a sale of 19 Strathmore
Road,
Caves Beach for $130,000 in May 1999.  The property 119 Strathmore Road has a
smaller area, namely, 1171 square metres compared
with the subject property 24
Strathmore Road, which has an area of 2,223 square metres.  It seems that in
arriving at his valuation
Mr Johns thought it was vacant when it was sold.
Having regard to the evidence it appears to me that Mr Fallon has a better
recollection
of the state of the land and his evidence was that at the time of
sale there was a slab and some structures on the land.  Accordingly,
it would
seem to me that this is not directly comparable and cannot be used to justify
the higher price.  Accordingly, I find that
the value of 24 Strathmore Road is
$140,000. 
<P>

29 The Esplanade, Caves Beach
<P>

23  	Mr Johns valued this property as at 14 September 1998 at
$440,000.  Mr Fallon whose valuation was made on 28 July 1999, the
day the
trial started, valued it at $400,000.  The property has six bedrooms and
accordingly there are not a lot of close comparables.
 However, in his report
Mr Fallon noted that there was water damage to the dining and family rooms
which needed repair.  Painting
was required and also the rear paling fence
required fixing.  Mr Johns did not refer to any difficulties with the roof in
his report
and presumably the damage had not occurred at the time he made his
inspection.  An interesting comparable was 35 The Esplanade, Caves
Beach which
was sold in May 1998 for $448,000.  It would appear to be a large property but
the number of bedrooms is not given. 
It had a triple garage, in ground pool
and good coastal views.  It appears to be superior to the subject property.  Mr
Johns has
used comparables in a number of different areas which were remote
from the street and suburb in question.  I think Mr Fallon's approach
using the
comparables in the close locality is  more appropriate.  Accordingly, I find
that the value is $400,000.
<P>

24  	The balance of the estate after allowing for debts and costs
will thus amount to $859,616.
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff's Situation</b>
<P>

25  	I turn to the situation of the plaintiff, Ashley.  Ashley,
although presently aged 19 years is of a far lower intellectual
age.  He is a
tall, solid boy who has the difficulties which 1 have earlier described.
<P>

<b>Doctor's evidence on the extent of Ashley's future disability.</b>
<P>

26  	I have evidence from Dr Ian Wilkinson who is a paediatric
neurologist who has known Ashley since 1984.  I have also had the
benefit of
evidence from Gael Andrews who is a social educator and experienced dealing
with children with disabilities from which
Ashley suffers.  She also has
knowledge of the type of institutional care that is available in the Hunter
Region.  Dr Wilkinson made
it plain that, although Ashley has autism and
intellectual handicap, he has no underlying basic physical condition, which
would make
it likely that his lifespan would be significantly shortened.  He
thought that Ashley would have a normal life expectancy.  However,
because of
the significant intellectual handicap and the effect on his behaviour Ashley
will always require supervision and if his
mother, Helen Reece, predeceases him
then there will be a requirement for someone else to care for him.  In his
report he said:-
<P>

"In the event, not unlikely, that she cannot continue to care for him because
of his difficult behaviour, he may well need to be
institutionalised, or placed
in a situation of care."
<P>

27  	This aspect received some attention in cross examination.
Ashley has in the last 12 months threatened his mother and he does
have
outbursts of temper.  Any increase in such violence might mean that he would
have to be institutionalised.  According to Dr
Wilkinson there was no
neurological problem which was likely to cause this to happen and he thought it
was more a psychological problem
that may need some evidence from a
psychiatrist.  In his view he thought that the situation was reasonably stable
at the moment and
he did not think that there was any current evidence to
indicate he was heading towards institutionalised care.  In the absence of
any
psychiatric evidence it would seem unlikely that Ashley will need to be
institutionalised until his mother reaches an age when
she can no longer cope
with him.  Given the current ages of Ashley and his mother on the life
expectancy tables it is likely that
Ashley would survive his mother for a
period of something in the order of 22 years.  
<P>

<b>Availability of</b> <b>institutional care.</b>
<P>

28  	It seems that permanent institutional care is not available for
someone such as Ashley while he has the support of his mother.
 There are very
few places available for people with Ashley's disability and it would only be
in the event that he is left without
any support at all that he would be likely
to obtain a position in an institution and then he would take a place that
would normally
be available to others for respite care.  After leaving the
special group at Merewether High School, Ashley did have some sheltered
work
placement.  However, he contracted multi-resistance staphylococci aureaus  in
June 1998 and ceased that work.  This year Ashley
has attended a post-school
option's course called "Response".  He attends Response four days a week from
9.30am to 3.30pm.  He has
funding for this year and must apply each year for
continued funding.  The maximum period that Ashley can attend is for a period
of some three years.  It goes without saying that it is always difficult to
find an appropriate sheltered environment for Ashley
to work and there will be
difficulties for him in this area.  Accordingly, although at present Ashley
does have some activities which
enable him to be occupied, the prospect in the
future of this continuing is not certain.  This, of course, has effects on his
mother.
 His mother presently works each day of the week from 9.30am to 1.30pm
in a part-time position as a doctor's receptionist.  If Ashley
was not able to
be occupied during the day she would be unable to continue with that
employment.  What this indicates is the extreme
uncertainty of Ashley's future
and the necessary care that will have to be provided for him.
<P>

<b>Mrs Reece's situation</b>
<P>

29  	As so much of Ashley's future revolves around his mother, Mrs
Reece, it is necessary to note her situation.  She owns a 1992
Dihatsu Charade
valued at $10,000.  She has furniture which is insured together with other
personal items for about $36,000.  She
has savings of something less than $600.
Her annual income as a secretary/receptionist is about $16,000 per annum.  She
is the only
person who supports and cares for Ashley.  Her father who had taken
an important role in looking after Ashley died in 1997.  She
and Ashley live in
a Housing Commission Villa unit.  
<P>

<b>Ashley's Future Needs</b>
<P>

30  	I turn to the assessment of Ashley's future needs and will first
deal with the need for accommodation.  One of the main areas
advanced for
Ashley is the need for him to have accommodation in the future.  He and his
mother reside in rented accommodation and
recently it has become apparent that
this accommodation which is a small two bedroom unit with a minimal four foot
by six foot garden
causes frustration for Ashley leading to some outbursts.  It
has been suggested that Ashley has a need for better accommodation.
 There is
evidence before me of the type of accommodation sought on Ashley's behalf.
Initially Mrs Reece suggested in her first affidavit
that there was a need to
purchase a two bedroom house or apartment in Merewether area that would cost
approximately $250,000.  More
recently Mrs Reece has suggested that a three
bedroom house in the Merewether area, which is quite a good location in
Newcastle,
would be appropriate.  The reason advanced for having a three
bedroom house was because a carer would have to have his or her own
room.  The
precise role of such a carer is not clear at the moment.  Given that at least
in the immediate future, Mrs Reece will
look after Ashley, a carer will not be
required for a number of years.  Even after Mrs Reece can no longer care for
Ashley there
is the possibility that institutional care may be found instead of
him having a carer.  
<P>

31  	Based upon evidence given by Mr Johns of the cost of housing in
the Merewether area of three bedroom homes, it suggested on
the plaintiff's
behalf that it is appropriate for a house to be purchased for $280,000 together
with costs involved in the purchase
of $10,642.  The evidence from Mr Johns
indicates that the price of such houses varies from $213,000 up to $340,000.
Those houses
at the higher end invariably have two garages something which was
not a necessity.  There were a number of houses with prices from
$213,000 to
$245,000 and even some of these had two garages.  Cross examination of Mr Johns
elicited that a two bedroom house in
the Adamstown area which is about 4 kms
from Merewether could be obtained for about $150,000.  Mr Fallon in his
evidence without
particularising whether the houses were two or three bedrooms
indicated that in Hamilton a house, presumably with at least two bedrooms,
could be acquired for about $157,000 and in Mayfield similar houses up to
$150,000.  
<P>

32  	Given the uncertain future and the fact that there may be a
possibility of also having to have a carer live in the house once
Ashley's
mother can no longer care a generous assessment of an amount necessary for
housing, I would have thought, would be the purchase
of a three bedroom house
in the area of $240,000 with additional costs in the order of $10,000, namely,
a total of $250,000.  It
is probably appropriate that the assessment be
generous because of the uncertainty of the future government requirements for
the
provision of homes for people with disabilities.  There is a move to
placement in group homes which requires individuals to contribute
to the cost
of such homes.  A house which can be sold in the future will be an insurance
against what might be a high cost of care
in such an environment.
<P>

33  	There are of course other costs involved in the accommodation
and these will be the on-going cost of maintaining such accommodation.
 These
costs are estimated at $5,200 per annum.  This figure covers council and water
rates, home insurance and home maintenance.
 Basing the period on the present
value for an eighteen year old until death this, using the appropriate
multiplier from the 3% tables
(1487), would come to a total sum of $148,700.

<P>

<b>On-going Maintenance Costs for Ashley</b>
<P>

34  	The difficult area here is the future maintenance for Ashley
particularly if, as is more likely, he survives his mother.  The
medical
evidence suggests that there would be no effect on his life expectancy as a
result of his difficulties.  His present life
expectancy is 62.  The difficulty
with the evidence that was given is that, as appeared from cross examination,
some of the estimates
of expenses were exaggerated.  A reasonable estimate of
expenses of the household is as follows:-
<P>

Food and Household expenses               $205.00
<P>

Health expenses                                        75.96
<P>

Utilities                                                     55.00
<P>

Insurance premiums                                 15.00
<P>

Motor vehicle and transport expenses      107.00
<P>

Sundry expenses                                      <u> 49.00</u>
<P>

       Total                                               <u>$506.96</u>
<P>

 
<P>

35  	One half of this would be applicable to Ashley, namely, $253.48.
Additional expenses that Ashley has himself are:-
<P>

Child care and education                          100.00
<P>

Clothing and footwear                               <u> 40.00</u> 
<P>

       Total                                                <u>$140.00</u>
<P>

36  	This makes the total expenses for Ashley $393.48 per week which
capitalised at the rate used before comes to $585,104.76. 

<P>

37  	It should be noted that Ashley does receive a pension at the
moment which is at the rate of $157.05 per week.  At the moment
he would be
entitled to earn $100 per fortnight income without reduction in his pension.
As a single home owner, he would be entitled
to have a home and assets of
$125,750 before his pension was reduced.  Once his assets increase to $246,000
he would not be entitled
to a pension.   Just simply taking off the income that
Ashley has from his expenses, which I have set out above, would bring his
need
down to $236.43 per week which capitalised at the relevant rate, would amount
to $351,571.41.  As this is in excess of the cut
off Ashley can, for these
purposes, be assumed to have no entitlement to a pension.  
<P>

38  	Clearly these needs are real in the sense that the estimates
assume that his mother will continue to work and receive the income
that she
presently receives and that a full time carer is not required.  
<P>

39  	Another area advanced for Ashley in respect of future needs is
some contingency in case he should fall on hard times.  This
is a little hard
to assess and in any event any such provision has to be looked at in the light
of the other claims on the estate
to which I will now turn.
<P>

<b>The claims of Possible Eligible Persons</b>
<P>

40  	It is also necessary to take into account the situation of
others who have a claim on the bounty of the deceased.  In this
case there are
four people who have not been notified of those proceedings.  These are the
deceased's earlier wives and his son by
his first marriage.  The first wife of
the deceased, known as Peggy, is someone who was married to him probably prior
to 1970.  Nobody
appears to have had any contact with her in recent years and
there is nothing to indicate whether she may have some possible claim.
Clearly, after that marriage, the deceased was married to Mrs Gallagher for
some ten years until he divorced her in 1980.  The evidence
from the defendant
seems to be that in respect of Michael, the son of the first wife Peggy, there
was no contact during the period
of her marriage for the last eight years.
Given the lapse of time the chances of a successful claim by Peggy or Michael
are not great.
 This depends upon the person not having any substantial needs.
One only has to look at the situation of the plaintiff who was totally
unknown
to the defendant to appreciate how surprises can occur in this area.  The only
evidence in respect of the third wife is that
the marriage was for two years
and that the lady apparently was from a wealthy American family.  The chances
of a claim would seem
somewhat less.  Nothing is known in respect of the
deceased's fourth wife and accordingly that is a claim which is impossible to
judge.  
<P>

41  	No doubt Mrs Warland will have some protection in that in due
course after giving appropriate notices she will distribute part
of the estate
and will receive the balance of the estate.  However, her only protection in
respect of the estate which she retains
will be that a court, dealing with an
application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 16</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>, might conclude that there
would be unacceptable prejudice to her if time were extended.  I think that all
I can do, given the lack
of evidence, is to take into account the fact there is
a possibility of some further claim against the defendant who will no doubt
retain in her own right whatever assets in the estate come to her after the
adjustments made as a result of these proceedings.
<P>

<b>The Defendant's Situation</b>
<P>

42  	The next person to consider is the deceased's widow, the
defendant.  She is presently aged 48 years and has a daughter aged
21 who is
partly dependent upon her.  Her daughter is currently undergoing some
university course but has part-time work in order
to support herself.
<P>

43  	The defendant's present asset situation is as follows:-
<P>

A half interest in the Elizabeth Bay property	$162,500
<P>

Savings	                                                              2,000
<P>

Loan to the estate                                                     4,962
<P>

Jewellery	                                                            20,000
<P>

Furniture and contents                                           50,000
<P>

2000 Telstra shares at $8.50                                  17,000
<P>

Interest in John Warland Retirement Fund          <u>185,905</u> 
<P>

                        Total                                          <u>$
442,367</u>
<P>

44  	Under the retirement fund the defendant, herself, has an
interest as a result of contributions made for the period that she
has been
working for the deceased's companies since 1994.  Her own interest in respect
of those contributions amounts to $43,000
but they could not be paid to her
without a substantial tax disadvantage because she has not yet reached 55 years
of age.  There
is also a death benefit payable in respect of the deceased.  The
amount of that benefit which may be paid under the fund to the deceased
is
$277,609.  The actual assets now available appear to be $265,905.  Thus these
funds can be transferred to her without a significant
tax penalty.  The trustee
of the superannuation fund is now Banlaw Pty Ltd the sole director of which is
the defendant.  She has
indicated in a recent affidavit that she proposes to
distribute that fund in the following way:-
<P>

Michael John Warland, the deceased's grandson      $10,000
<P>

Katherine Virola, the deceased's stepdaughter
<P>

and daughter of the defendant                                  $70,000
<P>

The defendant
$185,905
<P>

45  	No doubt this latter distribution would be by way of
distribution in specie of the half share of the unit at Elizabeth Bay
which
would leave the defendant owning it absolutely.  The other funds for
distribution would no doubt come from the remaining assets
held by the
superannuation fund which amount to $103,405.
<P>

46  	There was an attack on the defendant for having made this
disposition.  However, she gave evidence of good reasons why it is
appropriate
that both Michael and her daughter have something and in the circumstances of
this case I would not think there is any
adverse view which I should take in
respect of her decision.  In my view it was motivated by a genuine regard for
Michael and her
daughter.
<P>

47  	There is also a car which is a 1996 Audi Cabriole.  That car is
owned by the company and is presently used by the defendant.
 It is on either
lease or hire purchase and the payout figure is $54,000.  It would not be
included in any sale of the business of
the deceased's company and accordingly
it is likely in those circumstances that either the defendant will continue to
keep the car
and pay the lease payments or, alternatively, it will be sold and
the defendant will be without a car.
<P>

48  	The defendant does have nursing qualifications and has worked
until 1994 in that profession.  She is qualified as an 8 year
trained nurse
subject to her perhaps having to undergo some retraining to obtain currency.
The evidence indicates that a salary which
she could obtain would be $836.70
per week.  Since 1994 she been working as a assistant in the business of the
deceased and presently
receives a salary of $855 net per week.  If the sale of
the business of Banlaw Pty Ltd which is proposed, goes ahead, she may receive
a
salary and employment from that company for some three years at $3,800 per
month.  At the present time she can meet her expenses
and save about $200 to
$300 per month.  The defendant does suffer from severe migraines, thyroid
problems, shoulder pain and insomnia.
 Although they cause her difficulties she
has been able to manage to look after the deceased and carry on her work
notwithstanding
these illnesses.
<P>

49  	<b>Discussion</b>
<P>

This is a difficult case and all the more so for the parties because the
defendant did not know of the existence of the child, Ashley,
until after the
death of the deceased.  Given the size of the estate, Ashley's demonstrated
needs and no provision for him in the
will, the first question in <b>Singer v
Berghouse </b>must be answered in the affirmative.  The second question
involves a difficult balancing exercise.  The plaintiff does not suggest
that
given the assessment of the needs which 1 have referred to earlier that the
whole estate should be left to him.  In essence,
the suggestion of the
plaintiff is that the defendant, with the provision of the Elizabeth Bay unit,
has sufficient assets and there
is no reason why she should not return to the
workface.  It is suggested that the house at Caves Beach is bigger than what
she and
her daughter need.  The plaintiff submits that a legacy of $800,000
would be appropriate.  This involves a consideration of what
is the proper
balance between a child with a severe disability and a widow who had a
relationship of some seven years with the deceased.
<P>

50  	Although the defendant does not have to justify the provisions
of the will it is sometimes instructive to look at what is thought
to be
appropriate in widows' claims under the Act.
<P>

51  	Such claims are frequently the subject of applications in this
Court.  The Court of Appeal in <b>Goloski v Goloski</b> (unreported 5 October
1993) has referred to formulations of this standard to be expected in respect
of a widow in terms which refer
to the decision of Powell J in <b>Luciano v
Rosenblum</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20NSWLR%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2 NSWLR 65</a> and <b>Elliott v Elliott</b>, which was
approved by the Court of Appeal on 24 April 1986.  There his Honour said:-
<P>

"Where the marriage of a deceased and his widow has been long and harmonious,
where the widow has loyally supported her husband
and assisted him to build up
and maintain his estate, the duty which a deceased owes to his widow can be no
less than to the extent
to which his assets permit him to achieve that result;
first to ensure that his widow be secure in her home for the rest of her life
and that if either the need arises or the whim strikes her she have the
capacity to change her home; secondly that she have available
to her an income
sufficient to enable her to live in a reasonable degree of comfort and free
from any financial worry; and, third,
that she have available to her a fund to
which she might have resort in order to provide herself with such modest
luxuries as she
might choose and which would provide her with a hedge against
any unforeseen contingency or disaster that life might bring".
<P>

52  	In the present case the duration of the defendant's association
with the deceased was for seven years.  She has made some contributions
to the
purchase of the Elizabeth Bay unit but the extent of her contribution is not
clear.  She certainly devoted time to care for
the deceased during his ill
health.  Given these facts the extent of what a widow in her situation should
receive is not covered
by the comments in <b>Goloski's case</b>.  The matter is
best considered bearing in mind the comments of Sheller JA in <b>Permanent
Trustee Co Ltd v Fraser </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2036%20NSWLR%2024" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 36 NSWLR 24</a> at 46F where he said:-
<P>

"Singer v Berghouse contains an authoritative restatement of the approach that
should be taken by the court when considering an
application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s7</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>. However, although the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> specifies
matters which may be taken into consideration and allows the court to take into
consideration unspecified circumstances
existing before and after the death of
the deceased person and any other matters which it considers relevant in the
circumstances,
it leaves undefined the norm by which courts must determine
whether a provision is inadequate for the applicant eligible person's
proper
maintenance, education and advancement in life. To achieve what is seen to be
the legislative intention and bring some certainty
into the application of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>, the courts have developed principles and standards which
have been applied in determining applications under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>
and its predecessors. One such was the provision a just and wise testator would
have thought it his or her moral duty to make in
the interests of the
prescribed claimants had he or she been fully aware of all the relevant
circumstances.
<P>

In deciding whether the provision for an eligible person is inadequate for that
person's proper maintenance education or advancement
in life the court should
be guided by consideration of the provision which, in accordance with
prevailing community standards of
what is right and appropriate and in the
circumstances mentioned in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> and then obtaining, ought
to be made in favour of the eligible person: compare White v Barron <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1924/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20144%20CLR%20431" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 144
CLR 431</a> at 440, 445 and Kearns v Ellis (Court of Appeal, 5 December 1984,
unreported) per Mahoney JA at 7. I do not think this approach produces
any
different result from that reached by reference to the concept of moral
obligation or duty as that expression had generally been
understood or used by
the courts. However it avoids doctrinal and inflexible judge made rules and
fulfils the court's function, adverted
to by Mahoney JA (at 8), of speaking for
the feeling and judgment of fair and reasonable members of the community. This
is a well
recognised approach in other areas of the law: compare Lord Atkin's
"general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing"(Donoghue v Stevenson
<a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1932/100.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1932] UKHL 100</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1932%5d%20AC%20562" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1932] AC
562</a> at 580) described by  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2036%20NSWLR%2024" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 36 NSWLR 24</a> at 47 Stephen J in Caltex Oil
(Australia) Pty Ltd v The Dredge "Willemstad" <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1976/65.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] HCA 65</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20136%20CLR%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 136 CLR 529</a> at 575 as the
broad principle which underlies liability in negligence. As well as allowing
for change in community standards this
approach involves no departure from the
language of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> and removes any possible diversion
resulting from a consideration of irrelevant moral duties of the sort to which
Stout CJ and Murphy
J referred and irrelevant behavioural considerations. I
think this is the approach which the courts should now adopt."
<P>

53  	In an age where there is a move away from institutionalised care
for people in Ashley's situation and a reluctance by Government
to provide
appropriate funding, the community would expect the father of such a person to
provide, to the extent possible, for the
future well being of his son for the
rest of his life.  The community would also expect him to make reasonable
provision for his
widow.  
<P>

54  	If a legacy of $800,000 were provided the defendant would only
receive about $60,000 from the estate.  She would have to sell
the business,
its properties and the matrimonial home.
<P>

55  	It is important that Ashley has a home as that will provide an
asset which will increase in value over time and will be a major
source of
funds if there is a need for capital because of a change in his
circumstances.
<P>

56  	No doubt the defendant is attached to the home at Caves Beach
but it is not necessary for her to have that home.  A more modest
but still
attractive dwelling would be readily available in the area.
<P>

57  	A balancing of the various considerations leads me to the view
than an order for a legacy for the plaintiff in the sum of $525,000
is
appropriate.  
<P>

58  	The orders that I make are:-
<P>

1.	That the plaintiff receive a legacy out of the estate of the deceased in the
sum of $525,000.
<P>

2.	That interest on such legacy under s 84A of the Wills <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and
Administration Act 1898</a> shall run from three months from today's date.
<P>

3.	The plaintiff's costs on a party and party basis and the defendant's on an
indemnity basis be paid or retained out of the estate.
