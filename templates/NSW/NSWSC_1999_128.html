CONTRACTS - Repudiation - Affirmation -RESTRAINT OF TRADE.  Employee, bound by
three-year contract and one-year restraint against
completion after
termination, writes letter to employer which asks for termination of his
contract, but also suggests the terminations
is a fait accompli.  Employer and
employee arrange a day two weeks later as employee's last day at work, on which
day employee is
paid ordinary pay, holiday pay, and long service leave
calculated to that day, plus three months' 'termination pay'.  HELD that letter
was not a repudiation; that in any event employer had manifested an intention
that the agreement end consensually and not by termination
for breach; and that
the employment terminated on the employee's last day at work, not three months
later.

<b><u>NO. 2289 OF 1994</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>HARRIS/D-E PTY. LTD.  V.  McCLELLAND'S COFFEE &amp; TEA PTY. LTD. &amp;
ORS.</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:   Prior to 24th August 1991, E.H. Harris &amp; Co. Pty. Limited
(which I will call "E.H. Harris") carried on the business
of processing and
selling coffee and tea products throughout Australia, a business which also
involved the sale of certain ancillary
products such as portions of UHT milk,
sachets of sugar, and other items.  Pursuant to a contract dated 24th August
1991, Douwe-Egberts
NV (a Netherlands company which I will call "D-E") acquired
that business from E.H. Harris for a price of about $33 million, of which
about
$20 million was apportioned to goodwill.  By a licence agreement of the same
date, D-E licensed the business to the plaintiff
Harris/D-E Pty. Limited.
<P>

2	Each of the third defendant Phillip McClelland, fourth defendant Jim Banks,
fifth defendant Eric Bellchambers, and sixth defendant
Steven Holder were
employees of E.H. Harris prior to 24th August 1991, and after that date became
employees of the plaintiff.  Phillip
McClelland entered into a written service
agreement dated 30th August 1991 with the plaintiff, which provided for a term
of three
years after which it was terminable on three months' notice.  The
agreement also contained a term that Phillip McClelland would not
carry on or
be engaged in any business competitive with the plaintiff's business for one
year after termination of the agreement.
 
<P>

3	In September 1991, Phillip McClelland became director of the second defendant
Ambassador Foods Pty. Limited, and since about October
1992 he and his family
have been the sole shareholders of that company.  The first defendant
McClelland's Coffee &amp; Tea Pty. Limited
was incorporated on 14th April 1993,
with Phillip McClelland and his wife becoming directors and Phillip McClelland
and Ambassador
Foods sole shareholders.  
<P>

4	Phillip McClelland ceased working with the plaintiff on 8th July 1992.  Later
in 1992, or early in 1993, Ambassador Foods commenced
selling some of the
ancillary products previously sold by E.H. Harris and the plaintiff; and after
8th July 1993, began selling coffee
and tea products.
<P>

5	In these proceedings, commenced 6th May 1994, the plaintiff seeks damages
against Phillip McClelland for breaches of his service
agreement, in particular
the term against competition.  Similar damages are sought against the first and
second defendants, and also
the sixth defendant Mr. Holder, on the ground of
known participation in Phillip McClelland's breaches of his agreement.  
<P>

6	The fourth defendant Mr. Banks ceased to be an employee of the plaintiff on
or about 1st September 1993; and the fifth defendant
Mr. Bellchambers ceased to
be an employee of the plaintiff on about 30th July 1993.  The plaintiff claimed
damages against those
defendants for breach of their contracts of employment,
on the basis that they gave assistance to the first and second defendants
while
still employed by the plaintiff.  The plaintiff now concedes that it cannot
succeed against the fifth defendant, and that it
can obtain at best nominal
compensatory damages from the fourth defendant.  
<P>

7	The plaintiff also claims exemplary damages.
<P>

	<b><u>OUTLINE OF FACTS</u></b>
<P>

8	Prior to August 1991, Phillip McClelland's father Kenneth McClelland was
Chairman and Managing Director of E.H. Harris.  Phillip
McClelland was Sales
and Marketing Manager.  They had both been engaged in the coffee and tea
business virtually all their working
lives.  
<P>

9	E.H. Harris operated separate food service and retail divisions.  The former
made up about two-thirds of its business.  The food
service division served the
hospitality industry, including hotels, motels, catering companies and
airlines.  It sold coffee and
tea to these organisations which in turn supplied
those products to customers.  It also sold packaged sugar, UHT milk, jams and
cookies,
which E.H. Harris obtained from other suppliers.  E.H. Harris packaged
the sugar, but other products were acquired already packaged.
 Jams and cookies
did not carry the Harris name.  The ancillary products made up about eighteen
percent of total sales.  In general,
they were sold to customers who were also
buying coffee and tea, but occasional sales were made to customers who did not
also buy
coffee and tea.  
<P>

10	The assets of E.H. Harris and associated companies included a shop in the
Strand Arcade, Sydney, selling coffee and tea, and
buildings in Mandible
Street, Alexandria.  There were branch offices established in Melbourne,
Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth, Canberra
and Newcastle.  There had recently been
purchased a property at Forrester Street, Kingsgrove.  
<P>

11	The sale of the business to the plaintiff was negotiated for the vendor by
Kenneth McClelland, and for the purchaser mainly by
Cor Boonstra, Chief
Executive Officer of D-E, and Allan Rogers, the Group Chief Executive Officer
of Grocery Products Australia for
Sara Lee Holdings (Australia) Pty. Limited (a
subsidiary of Sara Lee Corporation of Maryland, which corporation was also the
holding
company of D-E).
<P>

12	The sale agreement between E.H. Harris (in the agreement called "Harris")
and its associated companies (in the agreement respectively
called
"Properties", "Strand" and "McClelland Properties") and D-E was dated 24th
August 1991.  The agreement included the following
definitions in cl.1:
<P>

	<b><i>(4)	"the Business" means Harris' trade and undertaking in the purchase,
processing, packing and distribution of coffee and tea throughout
Australia and
includes the retail operation conducted by Strand in the Strand Arcade, Sydney
as at the Completion Date.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(5)	"the Completion Date" means the 30th day of August 1991 or such
other date as shall be mutually agreed by the parties hereto.</i></b>
<P>

13	Clause 12 provided that D-E should procure that the plaintiff employ Phillip
McClelland on terms of a draft service agreement
which was annexed.  Clause 19
provided for leases to the plaintiff of identified Harris premises in
Alexandria, Kingsgrove and Mansfield
in Queensland.  Clause 20 was in the
following terms:   
<P>

	<b><i>20.1	Each of Harris Strand Properties and McClelland Properties warrant
and undertake to D-E that, for the protection of D-E in respect
of the goodwill
of the Business, Harris will not, whether on its own account or jointly with or
on behalf of any other person or
corporation as an independent contractor,
partner, joint venturer or agent carry on or be engaged in any business
competitive with
the Business within Australia for a period of 3 years after
the Completion Date.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	20.2	The provision of clause 20.1 shall not prevent Harris from holding
either directly or indirectly shares in D-E or less than
5% of the issued
capital of any company listed on a recognised stock exchange where such company
may be engaged in a business competitive
with the Business.</i></b>
<P>

14	Three other agreements were also dated 24th August 1991.  First, a
Shareholders Deed, whereby E.H. Harris was to acquire five
percent of the
plaintiff's shares.  Second, an agreement whereby D-E licensed the business it
was acquiring to the plaintiff.  Third,
an asset acquisition agreement between
D-E and the plaintiff, the terms of which are not here relevant.
<P>

15	The service agreement between the plaintiff and Phillip McClelland,
contemplated by the main agreement, was subsequently executed
and dated 30th
August 1991.  Relevant provisions are the following:
<P>

	<b><i>1.1	In this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	"the Business" means the business of purchasing, processing, packaging
and distributing coffee and tea and such other business or
businesses as the
Company may from time to time designate;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	"the Term" means the period during which this Agreement and McClelland's
engagement by the Company continues, as provided by Clause
21.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	2.1	The Company will employ McClelland in the Business under the
designation of General Manger - Sales and Marketing and McClelland
will serve
the Company during the Term in accordance with this Agreement.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	2.2	This Agreement will continue for a period of 3 years and shall be
renewed thereafter from year to year unless terminated by either
party in
accordance with the provisions of Clause 5</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	4.1	McClelland will:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	...</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(4)	keep confidential all information which McClelland may receive
concerning the affairs of the Company or the Business and not
at any time
during the Term or thereafter except at the direction or with the prior
approval of the Company divulge either directly
or indirectly to any person or
company any knowledge or information which McClelland may acquire or have
acquired during the course
of or incidental to McClelland's employment by the
Company (whether during the Te4rm or prior thereto) concerning the affairs or
property of the Company or the Business or any business, matter or transaction
in which the Company may be or may have been concerned
or
interested;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	5.1	This Agreement may be terminated by either party without cause on
three months' notice to the other which notice may be given
at any time after
(but not before) the expiry of the three year period specified in Clause
2.2</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	5.2	The Employer may terminate the employment of McClelland by notice in
writing at any time if McClelland:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(1)	commits any serious breach or is persistently in breach of any of
the provisions of this Agreement;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(2)	is guilty of any grave misconduct or of any wilful neglect in the
performance of McClelland's duties; </i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(3)	suffers any physical or mental illness which continues for a period
which exceeds 90 days and prevents McClelland from attending
properly to
McClelland's duties hereunder;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(4)	is declared bankrupt or enters into any composition or arrangement
with or makes any assignment of McClelland's property in favour
of McClelland's
creditors generally; or</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(5)	is found guilty of any criminal offence.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	6.1	McClelland warrants and undertakes to the Company that McClelland
shall not:.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(i)	on his own account or jointly with or on behalf of any other person
or corporation as an officer, employee, independent contractor,
partner, joint
venturer or agent</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(ii)	nor shall any firm or corporation (other than a company of a type
referred to in clause 6.2) in which he may be interested as
an employee,
director, shareholder, beneficial owner or controller of shares, lender or
adviser;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	carry on or be engaged in any business competitive with the Business
within Australia for a period of one year after the date of
termination of this
Agreement.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	6.2	The provisions of Clauses 4.1(6) and 6.1 shall not prevent
McClelland from holding either directly or indirectly less than 5%
of the
issued capital of any company listed on a recognised and substantial stock
exchange where such company may be engaged in a
business competitive with the
Business or shares in the Company.</i></b>
<P>

16	After the acquisition, Allan Rogers became a member of the Board of the
plaintiff.  Kenneth McClelland was also on the Board,
and was employed as
Executive Chairman of the plaintiff.  Although as such Kenneth McClelland was
Chief Executive Officer of the
plaintiff, it seems that Allan Rogers, his
superior in the Sara Lee/D-E organisation, exercised some control over the
plaintiff's
operations.  This led to some dissatisfaction on the part of
Phillip McClelland.  
<P>

17	Phillip McClelland wrote to Mr. Boonstra in The Netherlands a letter dated
17th January 1992, in the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>As you are aware, it is now 4.5 months since Sara Lara (sic) acquired
the majority of the Harris business</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	I am writing to you to express my disappointment and concern in retard
to the ongoing management of this organisation.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	From day one, that is, from our initial meeting with you in June 1991,
it was clearly indicated that the Corporate policy was "The
people who built
this business should continue to run it".  This has been restated, re enforced
(sic) by </i><cite>all</cite><i> Sara Lee personnel with which we have had
contact, all that is, with the exception of Allan Rogers.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Rogers, it would seem, is determined to take complete control over
Harris/D-E but at the same time leave himself room to pass the
blame onto
someone else when things go wrong.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Our monthly executive meetings are somewhat of a joke in so much as
Rogers only hears what Rogers wants to hear.  Unless Rogers himself
brings up
initiatives, or indeed if somehow he can be made to believe that a new idea is
his and his alone, then it goes nowhere.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	His introduction to Harris on October 2nd 1991 of his "Marketing Guru"
Lyn Robinson, who I found to be the most arrogant self opinionated
person I
have ever had the misfortune to meet, was the first step in his endeavour to
take complete control.  A move which failed
only after numerous
confrontations.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	With the introduction of Moccona to this organisation scheduled for July
1st 1992, a date which is rapidly approaching, we still
have not been afforded
the courtesy of any significant information of the Moccona operation in
Australia.  Indeed it is becoming
obvious that Stuart Alexander personnel who
will be transferred to Harris/D-E are the preferred management team for the
future. 
I presume because they only tell Rogers what he wants to
hear.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Complete integration of the two operations cannot be effected without
any adequate computer system.  Rogers employed a consultant
(Klaus Sbresny) who
subsequently produced a report and recommendation on the Harris &amp; Stuart
Alexander information systems. 
This report was rejected as unworkable and
inadequate not only by Harris personnel, but also by Stuart Alexander.  Our EDP
Manager
(Peter Wilson) then produced an excellent report indicating exactly
what was required, not only for complete integration but also
to fulfill (sic)
Sara Lees (sic) Corporate requirements.  This report brought Klaus back in
basically to tear this report apart,
yet another example of what Rogers wants
Rogers gets.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	My concern is that if Rogers (sic) plan is implemented it will basically
fail and when it does, I do not want to give Rogers the
opportunity of passing
the blame onto (sic) Peter Wilson, who I might add had done an excellent job
for Harris over the past 8 years
and knows our need and requirements inside
out.  I believe Peter in fact to be far superior in ability and application of
practical
solutions than is Klaus Sbresny (who, I am led to believe has been
offered a permanent job in Rogers power base at North Sydney).</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Cor, I believe Harris/D-E has a great future and when coupled with
Moconna will be virtually untouchable in the Tea &amp; Coffee
Industry in
Australia.  My concern is that if Rogers is let to continue down this virtual
path of destruction then Harris/D-E will
fail.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	I have put 19 years of hard work into this organisation and will not
stand back and see it destroyed by one man.  It is painfully
obvious that the
only way to perceivably succeed in Sara Lee Australia is to be a Rogers "Yes
Man".  I am not a yes man and never
will be.  I say what I think and do what I
know is right in the best interests of the company.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Sending you this letter has put my position in jeopardy, a move I would
not make unless I believe it to be in the best interests
of this
Company.</i></b>
<P>

('Moccona" was a brand of coffee previously marketed in Australia by D-E, and
it was proposed to integrate this business with the
business acquired from E.H.
Harris).  No copy of this letter was provided either to Mr. Rogers or to
Kenneth McClelland.
<P>

18	In February 1992, Kenneth McClelland attended a strategy meeting in The
Netherlands, at which time he conveyed to Mr. Boonstra
and Mr. Rogers that he
did not wish to stay on as Executive Chairman.  In March 1992, Kenneth
McClelland left the employment of the
plaintiff, although he continued as
non-executive chairman.  He continued to attend regularly at premises owned by
E.H. Harris, part
of which were leased to the plaintiff, and in that way
maintained some contact with the plaintiff's activities.  On 25th March 1992,
Phillip McClelland was appointed a director of the plaintiff.  
<P>

19	In May 1992, Phillip McClelland went to The Netherlands to meet D-E
personnel.  One person he met was Henk De Wilt, a senior
officer of D-E in The
Netherlands.  On his return to Australia, Phillip McClelland wrote a letter to
Mr. De Wilt dated 26th May 1992,
in the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>As I only arrived back in Sydney yesterday (25/05) this is the first
opportunity that I have had to sincerely thank you for the hospitality
that you
extended to Joanne and myself during our recent visit.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	During our discussion in Utrecht we discussed the problems that
Harris/D,E, are experiencing with Allan Rogers.  Upon my return it
has become
immediately apparent that the situation has deteriorated substantially, to the
point of being, not only completely unworkable
but, in my opinion to the
detriment of the Company.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	We are no longer able to trade using our traditional methods.  This is
now showing through in the form of lower sales figures, which
can directly be
attributed to the policies of Rogers.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	We are compelled to trade on the same philosophies as Kitchen of Sara
Lee, which may work well for frozen cakes, but certainly does
not work for
selling Tea and Coffee in Australia.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	I am given little or no control over policy decisions effecting the
Company and have been allowed no input into the integration of
Moccona/Moccomat.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Whilst I have the position of General Manager, I am prevented, by
Rogers, from effectively carrying out that role.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	I have seen over the past few years our 2 main competitors taken over by
multi nationals, the results have been devastating.  These
2 companys (sic) now
virtually cease to exist.  Rogers is destroying Harris in exactly the same
manner.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	One of our great strengths at Harris has always been our people - people
make it happen.  We have a great team at Harris but as each
day goes past they
are becoming more and more disenchanted and de-motivated to the point that we
are in very real danger of losing
the key players in this
organisation.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	I have watched and have been a part of the growth of Harris and I will
not stand by and watch it be destroyed by one man.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	I will not allow Rogers to pass the blame onto any of my staff when it
is obvious to everyone here at Harris where the problem is.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	I sincerely hope that you can assist me in preventing certain
disaster</i></b>

Executive Officer of the plaintiff following Kenneth
McClelland's retirement.

<P>

20	On 27th May 1992, Phillip McClelland sent a facsimile to Phil O'Callahan and
Keith Alm, two senior officers of Sara Lee Corporation
in the following
terms:

been forced to implement by Allan Rogers.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	I expect that we will fall further behind unless we can revert to our
traditional Sales and Marketing methods.  Under the policies
of Allan Rogers it
now appears unlikely that we will achieve our plan FY92.  This is impossible to

apparent the extent of the damage caused
by the policies of Allan Rogers.</i></b>
<P>

21	On 9th June 1992, Phillip McClelland received a telefax from Mr. De Wilt,
addressed to "Phil" and signed "Henk", in the following
terms:
<P>

	<b><i>Only yesterday, after his return of a three week trip, I had the
opportunity to discuss the content of your last telefax with Mr.
Boonstra.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	We agreed that I would let you know about our conversation.  Mr.
Boonstra will pay appropriate attention to the issue.</i></b>
<P>

22	There is in evidence a memorandum dated 19th June 1992 produced on subpoena
by Sly &amp; Weigall, Solicitors, referring to Phillip
McClelland and the
plaintiff, and continuing:
<P>

	<b><i>Attending you discussing your Service Agreement with Harris D-E.
Advising on term and restraints.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	You would raise the matter with Alan Rogers to seek a reasonable basis
for terminating your employment.</i></b>
<P>

23	On 22nd June 1992, Phillip McClelland sent by facsimile a letter to Mr.
Boonstra, together with a document by which he purported
to resign as a
director of the plaintiff as from 22nd June 1992.  The body of that letter was
as follows:
<P>

	<b><i>Following on from my letter of 26th May 1992 to Mr H de Wilt in which I
outlined the difficulties I am experiencing with Allan Rogers.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	The way Rogers is running the company is so totally opposed to what I
believe to be the correct way to get the results that the conflict
is now
having an adverse effect on the Company.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	It is, therefore, with deep regret, that I ask for the termination of my
contract.  I am, within reason, willing to do anything to
ensure that the
severing of this relationship causes the minimum of disruption to Harris/D-E.
To this end I am prepared to stay at
Harris until 26th September
1992.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	I will inform Rogers of this communication tomorrow (Tuesday 23rd June
1992) but I would prefer not to deal with Rogers in regard
this
termination.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	I wish you and the Company well for the future and hope that one day the
true facts about Harris/D-E will somehow surface.</i></b>
<P>

24	On the same day, a confidential facsimile was sent by Mr. Boonstra to Mr.
Alm, which so far as relevant was in the following
terms:
<P>

	<b><i>I spoke to Allan Rogers, Monday evening Sydney time, about a letter I
received from Phil McClelland (see encl.).  Phil told us that
he resigned and
is proposing to stay until September 26, 1992.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	You already know how I think about his skills to communicate the way he
did in the past and also his attitude to try to blame Allan
for his bad results
are quite aggravating.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	We in the company do not have a policy that we leave a manager in his
responsibility after it has become clear that he is not performing
or is
willing to leave, so we have to take Phil out as soon as possible.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	I would like to have legal advise (sic) in respect of stopping Phil to
ever start an out-of-home or retail coffee business.  Probably,
Phil is going
to blame us for his failure and as a human being, is going to try to prove to
us that the way he wants to do business
is more successful.  So let us look at
the legal side now.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Secondly, please make sure that his father is well informed and that his
brother-in-law and uncle stay on board.</i></b>
<P>

25	On 23rd June 1992, there was a meeting between Messrs. Rogers, Alm, Keith
McClelland and Phillip McClelland.  There is some dispute
as to what was said
at that meeting.  It appears that Phillip McClelland's letter of 22nd June 1992
was described as a "resignation".
 It seems clear that Mr. Rogers and/or Mr.
Alm indicated to Phillip McClelland the plaintiff's acceptance that Phillip
McClelland
should go, and should go sooner rather than later.  At that or
another meeting it was agreed between Mr. Rogers and Phillip McClelland
that
his last day at work would be 8th July 1992.  The resignation as director was
accepted, purportedly at a meeting between Kenneth
McClelland and Mr. Rogers
recorded as having taken place early on 22nd June 1992.  
<P>

26	On 23rd June 1992, Phillip McClelland purchased a coffee roaster, with the
capacity to roast 1kg of coffee.  He subsequently
paid cash for this
roaster.
<P>

27	On 8th July 1992, Phillip McClelland attended for his last day, and received
a final payment as calculated by the plaintiff's
accounting staff.  That
payment comprised ordinary pay to 8th July 1992, holiday pay and long service
leave calculated on service
to 8th July 1992, and three months' "termination
pay".  A statement setting out the relevant amounts was signed by Phillip
McClelland,
as requested by Mr. Rogers.  
<P>

28	It seems clear that around the time he ceased working with the plaintiff,
Phillip McClelland formed the intention to go back
into the coffee and tea
business after 8th July 1993, which he understood to be the end of the
restriction against competition. 
It also seems clear that, at least by about
October 1992, he had formed the intention to sell other food products in the
meantime,
including some of the ancillary products sold by the plaintiff, and
in doing so, to deal with customers of the plaintiff.  Phillip
McClelland said
in evidence that this was to give himself and his staff something to do, and
also to maintain contact with customers
to facilitate subsequent sales of
coffee and tea.  
<P>

29	After 8th July 1992, Phillip McClelland attended the E.H. Harris offices at
its Kingsgrove premises, where he would see employees
of the plaintiff,
including Mr. Holder, who was then the National Sales Manager of the plaintiff.
It seems clear that on these occasions
they had some discussion of Phillip
McClelland's plans.  Mr. Holder resigned from the plaintiff's employment on
13th October 1992.
 
<P>

30	By 22nd July 1992, Phillip McClelland had reserved the name Ambassador Foods
Pty. Limited.  
<P>

31	One significant customer of the plaintiff was the Flag Group.  Between 9th
and 14th August 1992, Phillip McClelland attended
the Flag convention in Perth,
and addressed the conference on behalf of the "preferred suppliers" of the Flag
Group, of which the
plaintiff was one.  Thereafter, he discussed with Flag
representatives the possible appointment of Ambassador Foods as a preferred
supplier, giving rise to a letter from the Flag Group dated 20th October 1992
setting out the terms relating to such employment.
 Phillip McClelland replied
to that letter by a letter dated 24th November 1992, in the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>As you are aware we will be supplying the Hospitality Industry with
Australian made products.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	It is our intention to commence supplying the industry early February
1993.  Currently we are finalising our Product Range and Pricing
and expect to
be able to formally seek Preferred Supplier status in the second half of
January 1993 at which time I will meet with
you in Melbourne to further discuss
this matter.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	In the meantime Steve and I would like to wish you and your family a
very merry Christmas and safe and happy holiday season.</i></b>
<P>

The "Steve" referred to in the letter is Mr. Holder.  
<P>

32	In about October 1992, Phillip McClelland and his family obtained control of
McClelland Properties Pty. Limited, and changed
its name to Ambassador Foods
Pty. Limited.  
<P>

33	The Country Comfort Group was another significant customer of the plaintiff.
A letter dated 26th November 1992 was sent to that
Group, signed by Phillip
McClelland and Mr. Holder, in the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>We have found a new </i><cite>Home</cite><i>!!</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Ambassador Foods Pty. Ltd</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	18 Forrester Street</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Kingsgrove   NSW    2209</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Phone:	(02) 554 4111</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Fax:	(02) 554 4222</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	We look forward to seeing you soon to explain the Australian made
products Ambassador are providing to the Hospitality Industry.</i></b>
<P>

34	A letter dated 18th January 1993 was sent to the Best Western Group, signed
by Mr. Holder, in the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>Further to our recent discussions relative to 'Ambassador Foods' desire
to become a Preferred Supplier for Best Western, please find
attached our price
schedule which is effective from February 1st 1993.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	As mentioned we would be prepared to pay a monthly rebate of 5% on total
purchases to Best Western Head Office.  We would also be
happy to attend your
Annual Conference and any Zone meetings to help promote our
products.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	We are now in the process of having artwork &amp; designs prepared for a
private label (Best Western) After Dinner Mints.  As soon
as this is available
I will make an appointment to see you.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Jon, thank you for taking the time to meet with me and we look forward
to the opportunity of being Preferred Suppliers for Best Western.</i></b>
<P>

It enclosed a six-page price schedule, including such items as UHT milk, sugar,
jam and cookies.  
<P>

35	1st February 1993 is the date when, according to Phillip McClelland,
Ambassador Foods commenced business, and when Mr. Holder
commenced his
employment with Ambassador Foods.  Apparently its first sale, of a cocktail
mix, was made on 8th February 1993.  From
this time, or shortly afterwards, its
business was conducted from the E.H. Harris premises in Mandible Street.  The
staff initially
comprised Phillip McClelland and Mr. Holder.  Later they were
joined by other ex-employees of the plaintiff.  Barry Stittson had
been
dismissed by the plaintiff, was unemployed for a period, and joined Ambassador
Foods on 5th March 1993.  Marie Stepan, who had
been Phillip McClelland's
secretary, approached him and said she had to leave the plaintiff, and asked
for a job.  She was employed
from 19th April 1993.  
<P>

36	Thereafter, until 8th July 1993, Ambassador Foods was in correspondence with
its customers, including customers of the plaintiff,
in relation to its sale of
ancillary products, including products sold by the plaintiff.  Its total sales
in that period amounted
to just over $24,000.00.  This included about $6,000.00
sales of cookies, about $6,000.00 of UHT milk, and about $3,500.00 sales
of
jams.  Other items not previously sold by the plaintiff included cocktail mix
and confectionary.
<P>

37	Over the same period, there was contact between employees of the plaintiff,
and Phillip McClelland and/or Mr. Holder.  The evidence
in the case suggests
that the initiative in these contacts mainly came from the plaintiff's
employees, who expressed some dissatisfaction
with their employment and
enquired about the possibility of employment with Phillip McClelland.  It
appears that it was conveyed
to them that there would be no possibility of
employment before 8th July 1993, but there could possibly be employment after
that
date.
<P>

38	One of the plaintiff's employees, John Clark, who managed the plaintiff's
business in Cairns, gave evidence that in April 1993,
Mr. Holder offered him a
salary package if he would join Ambassador Foods after 8th July 1993.  Mr.
Holder denied that he did more
than discuss the possibility of such employment.
In early May 1993, Phillip McClelland went to Cairns to see Mr. Clark.  Mr.
McClelland's
evidence was that he was considering employing Mr. Clark when he
went back into the coffee and tea business after 8th July 1993,
and was
concerned that Mr. Clark might leave the plaintiff's employment and obtain
employment elsewhere in the meantime.  He wanted
to persuade Mr. Clark to
continue with the plaintiff, until he might be employed by Ambassador Foods.

<P>

39	On 21st May 1993, Industrial Sugar Mills wrote to Phillip McClelland a
letter which referred to their meeting of 4th May 1993,
and provided prices for
packing portion-controlled sugar and coffee products.  A hand-written note on
the bottom of the letter records:
 "28/5/93 Samples of coffee delivered to
Phillip at Ambassador".
<P>

40	On 7th June 1993, Sly &amp; Weigall, Solicitors, wrote a letter of advice to
Phillip McClelland, in the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>We refer to discussions with you concerning the termination of your
Employment Agreement with Harris/D-E Pty Limited and your proposed
entry into
the business of buying and selling tea and coffee.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Your Service Agreement with Harris/D-E Pty Limited imposes certain
restraints on you which are to operate for a period of 1 year
after date of
termination of the Agreement.  We have reviewed the letter sent by you to the
Chairman of the Board of Management of
Sara Lee/D-E NV on 22 June 1992 seeking
termination of the Agreement with effect from 26 September 1992.  On the
following day Mr.
Rogers of Harris/D-E Pty. Limited advised you that you could
end your connection with the company on 8th July 1992 and your entitlements
to
pay and other severance benefits were implemented on that date.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	You are familiar with the terms of the restrain but put simply they
restrict you for a period for 12 months from either directly
or indirectly
carrying on or being engaged "in any business competitive with the Business
within Australia for a period of 1 year
after the date of termination of this
Agreement.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	"Business" is defined as purchasing, processing, packaging and
distributing coffee and tea and such other business or businesses
as the
company from time to time designate.  It is assumed that no other business has
been designated by Harris/D-E Pty. Limited
as business carried on by
it.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	To date you have:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	1.	Established a company called "Ambassador Foods Pty. Limited" which
has commenced trading in the catering area but not in tea and
coffee;
</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	2.	Purchased plant and equipment to be used in connection with the tea
and coffee business but as yet have not yet commenced operating
the
plant;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	3.	Discussed packaging to be used by you for coffee marketed under the
name "McClelland Coffee";</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	4.	Ordered overseas supplies of raw coffee for delivery to Australia on
the basis that delivery will not take place before 8 July
1993;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	5.	Ordered glass bowls branded "McClelland Coffee" to be manufactured in
the USA.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	The only one of these activities which in our opinion would be in breach
of the restraint covenant is the placing of orders for supply
of coffee.  Even
though the coffee is not to be delivered until after expiration of the
restraint period, we believe that the act
of ordering would constitute
purchasing and on the basis that it must be expected that Harris/D-E Pty.
Limited will take every step
possible to frustrate your business activities, we
believe it would be in your interest to cancel those orders and re-order after
the expiration of the 12 month period.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	We also discussed the question of employing former employees of E.H.
Harris &amp; Co. Pty. Limited and while such actions are not
unusual, you could
be rendered liable if it can be established that you have induced employees of
Harris/D-E Pty. Limited to breach
their Employment Agreements.  We note that
you have been approached by a number of Harris/D-E employees seeking employment
with you
and although technically there can be no objection provided you have
done nothing to induce them to leave there remains the risk
that Harris/D-E
will seek to establish a more sinister role on your part.  If you are
approached by Harris/D-E employees, you should
be careful to record the time
and circumstances and avoid any possibility of a later suggestion that you have
contributed in any
way to them terminating their existing employment
arrangements.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	We note that you presently have the use of telephone services formerly
used by E.H. Harris &amp; Co. Pty. Limited, and that care
is being exercised to
ensure that there is no suggestion that the business of buying, selling or
marketing tea and coffee is for
the time being carried on by you.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Subject to the item of purchasing raw coffee, we are of the opinion that
none of your activities to date would constitute breach
of the terms of your
restraint covenant but repeat our warning that every care should be taken to
avoid any situation which might
give to Harris/D-E Pty. Limited the excuse of
commencing disruptive proceedings against you.</i></b>
<P>

In evidence, Phillip McClelland said that no order for coffee had in fact been
placed at that time.  However, he agreed that he
had purchased plant and
equipment to be used in connection with the coffee and tea business.  In
particular, he said that a coffee
roaster, with the capacity to roast about 65
kilograms of coffee, was purchased about this time; although it was not
installed and
able to roast coffee until about September 1993.  
<P>

41	On 9th July 1993, Mr. Holder on behalf of Ambassador Foods wrote a letter to
the Director of Purchasing, Conrad Jupiters, which
was a customer of the
plaintiff.  This letter was in the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>Thank you for taking the time to meet with Les Haigh and myself.  We now
have great pleasure in introducing Conrad International Hotel
&amp; Jupiters
Casino to the new player in the Australian Coffee &amp; Tea market McCLELLAND'S
COFFEE &amp; TEA.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	McClelland's Coffee &amp; Tea are a wholly Australian owned company that
has recently been established.  Our team comprises of staff
and management that
have been associated with the coffee and tea industry for  many years, and have
the professionalism and expertise
to provide for all your
requirements.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	We at McClelland's have developed and produced a range of high grade
coffee and tea to ensure your patrons are enjoying a quality
cup of coffee and
tea.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	We are a National Company and will have branches throughout Australia by
the end of August 1993.  Our major objectives are to provide
to all our
customers a Quality Product, Reliable Service and a Friendly Face.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Trevor, we would be grateful if McClelland's would be given the
opportunity to quote in the near future, and if we can offer assistance
in any
way please do not hesitate to contact us.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Assuring you of our very best attention at all times.</i></b>
<P>

42	According to evidence given by Phillip McClelland, the first order placed
for coffee was an order dated 20th July 1993 for instant
coffee, and the first
order for coffee for roasting was placed on 23rd August 1993.  His evidence was
that the first coffee was sold
by Ambassador Foods in about September 1993; but
he did concede that, on or shortly after 9th July 1993, through Ambassador
Foods
he commenced competing with the plaintiff in respect of coffee and tea
products.
<P>

43	On 24th July 1993, advertisements for sales staff for Ambassador Foods were
placed in newspapers in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide,
Brisbane and Cairns.
These resulted in large numbers of job applications, but in the event the
positions were filled by employees
or ex-employees of the plaintiff with whom
Phillip McClelland or Mr. Holder had previously been in contact.  Subsequently,
statutory
declarations were made by these persons, of which the following, made
by Mr. Clark on 15th December 1993, is typical:
<P>

	<b><i>1.	I approached Phillip McClelland of my own volition concerning the
possibility of obtaining employment.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	2.	I have since applied for employment with Ambassador Foods Pty.
Limited (Ambassador Foods).</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	3.	No offer of employment was made to me before 8 July 1993 by Phillip
McClelland, Ambassador Foods or any person associated with
Mr. McClelland or
Ambassador Foods.</i></b>
<P>

44	In September 1993, Ambassador Foods applied to Westpac for finance, to
replace its existing bankers.  In a credit proposal dated
15th September 1993,
signed by the Commercial Manager, Mr. Kaye, the following was noted:
<P>

	<b><i>Phillip McClelland was earlier this year contacted by executives of
several large corporations (i.e. clients) who were very unhappy
with the
service currently being provided (via distributor agencies) by the
Harris/Moccona Company and they have offered to move
their business to him if
he re-establishes the McClelland family Coffee and Tea business as a competitor
to Harris/Moccona.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Since Phillip McClelland has left the Company, 16 key personnel for
Harris/Moccona throughout Australia have also left to join him
to recommence
the old business on a smaller scale (1/3rd size).</i></b>
<P>

However, in cross-examination Phillip McClelland denied that he had spoken to
clients of the plaintiff about coffee and tea at any
time prior to 9th July
1993.
<P>

	<b><u>ISSUES</u></b>
<P>

45	The following issues have been debated in this case.  
<P>

46	First, there are questions concerning the construction of the service
agreement between the plaintiff and Phillip McClelland.
 The central issue
concerns the meaning of "the Business" used in cl.6.1 and defined in cl.1.1.
There is also a question whether
a term alleged by the plaintiff is to be
implied in the agreement.  
<P>

47	Second, there is a claim for rectification of the agreement, which the
plaintiff wishes to pursue in the event of a restrictive
construction being
given to "the Business".  
<P>

48	Third, there is the question whether Phillip McClelland repudiated his
service agreement, and whether any such repudiation was
accepted by the
plaintiff; or alternatively, whether the service agreement was terminated by
agreement between the parties.  
<P>

49	Fourth, there is the question of the duration of the restraint under cl.6.1
of the agreement.  If the termination was consensual,
the question is whether
the period of the restraint runs from 8th July 1992, or from some day in
September or October 1992.  If there
was repudiation and acceptance of
repudiation, there is the question of whether the plaintiff is entitled to
damages calculated on
the basis that, but for his repudiation, Phillip
McClelland would have been bound by a restraint against competition running the
full three-year term of the service agreement plus one year thereafter.  
<P>

50	Fifth, there is the question whether Phillip McClelland has been in breach
of cl.6.1 of the service agreement.  This question
involves some issues of
credit, concerning alleged approaches by Phillip McClelland and Mr. Holder to
customers and employees of
the plaintiff.  
<P>

51	Sixth, there is the question of whether the plaintiff has established a
breach by Mr. Banks of his contract of employment.  This
raises a question of
credit also.  However, it is common ground that even if breach is shown, no
damages flowing from the breach
have been proved.  
<P>

52	Seventh, there is the question of the liability of the first and second
defendants for knowing participation in Phillip McClelland's
breach of
contract, if that be proved.
<P>

53	Eighth, there is then a similar question in relation to Mr. Holder.  
<P>

54	Ninth, there is the question of the basis on which damages are to be
assessed, particularly against Phillip McClelland.
<P>

55	Finally, there is the question of the plaintiff's claim for exemplary
damages against all defendants, but in particular against
Phillip McClelland
and Mr. Holder.
<P>

56	I have been provided with quite extensive written submissions, and I will be
brief in my recounting of these submissions.  
<P>

	
<P>

<b>	<u>CONSTRUCTION OF SERVICE AGREEMENT</u></b>
<P>

<b>	<u>Submissions</u></b>
<P>

57	Mr. Sullivan QC for the plaintiff submitted that the same construction
should be given to the expression "the Business" in the
service agreement as in
the sale agreement.  Furthermore, it was permissible to take into account
background facts known to the parties
or notorious:  <u>Codelfa Construction v.
State Rail Authority of NSW</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR 337</a> at 352; <u>Prenn v.
Simmonds</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%201%20WLR%201381" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) 1 WLR 1381</a>; <u>Reardon Smith Line v. Hansen-Tangen</u>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%201%20WLR%20989" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 1 WLR 989.</a>  In this case, such facts included that E.H. Harris' trade
included the sale of ancillary products, which were sometimes sold separately;
that D-E had purchased the whole of E.H. Harris' business, including
stock-in-trade and equipment, such stock-in-trade including
ancillary products
and equipment including equipment used for packaging sugar; that allocation of
goodwill to various parts of the
business was based on total sales, including
sales of ancillary products; that the sale of ancillary products provided a
service
to customers; and that D-E or the plaintiff would continue to conduct
the same business.  Accordingly, cl.6.1 of the service agreement
operated to
prevent Phillip McClelland from being involved in any business in the food
services sector involving the sale of any
of the products which, prior to the
acquisition, were being sold as part of E.H. Harris' business.  
<P>

58	Alternatively, there should be implied on the basis of business efficacy a
term in the service agreement that, for a period of
one year after termination
of the agreement, Phillip McClelland would not seek or solicit or deal with
customers of the plaintiff
or employees of the plaintiff on behalf of any
business which was competitive with that of the plaintiff.
<P>

59	Mr. Conti QC for the defendants submitted that the pre-contractual documents
showed the minimal importance of products other
than coffee and tea:  they were
not specified in such documents, and amounted to only 18% of gross sales.
Coffee and tea was what
the business was all about, and that is where the
goodwill of the business lay.  Mr. Conti pointed to variations between the
definitions
of "the Business" in the two agreements, and submitted that
agreements restraining employees should not be given a wide interpretation.
Accordingly, cl.6.1 should not be read as restraining the sale of ancillary
products, and in particular the sale of ancillary products
without any sale of
coffee and tea.  This was consistent with the attitude shown by the plaintiff,
on becoming aware that ancillary
products were being sold.
<P>

	<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

60	In my opinion, it is clear that "the Business" in the agreement whereby D-E
purchased the business meant the whole business as
conducted by E.H. Harris,
including the dealing in ancillary products along with coffee and tea and, to a
minor extent, independently.
 Plainly, the whole business was being purchased.
The stock of ancillary products was being purchased.  Eighteen percent of total
sales was not insignificant, and on the evidence, I think it is clear that the
dealing in ancillary products made some contribution
to the goodwill of the
business.  The fact that the definition referred to "coffee and tea" and not
other products does not in my
opinion detract from that view, because that was
a reasonable shorthand way of referring to the E.H. Harris business.
<P>

61	I accept that there is a change of wording when one comes to the definition
of "the Business" in the service agreement.  However,
particularly where a
draft of the service agreement was annexed to the sale agreement, it is plain
that "the Business" in the service
agreement, by which Phillip McClelland was
to be employed pursuant to cl.2.1 of the sale agreement, was the business being
purchased
under the purchase agreement by D-E which was in turn to be licensed
to the plaintiff (plus any other business designated by the
plaintiff).  In my
opinion, the whole of the E.H. Harris business thus being purchased is fairly
described by the words in the definition
in the service agreement, that is,
"the business of purchasing, processing, packaging and distributing coffee and
tea".  When one
has regard to the relationship of the service agreement to the
sale agreement, I do not think it would be appropriate to construe
that
definition narrowly, it might be as if it were purely a matter between employer
and employee.
<P>

62	This approach does not mean that any sale of ancillary products in the food
service market would necessarily be competitive with
that business.  However,
it does mean that the business, in relation to which the question of
competition arises, is not a business
limited to dealing in coffee and tea and
nothing else, but is rather the whole of the business as previously carried on
by E.H. Harris,
and subsequently carried on by the plaintiff.  
<P>

63	In those circumstances, as I believe the plaintiff concedes, there is no
basis for implying any term restricting competition.
<P>

	<b><u>RECTIFICATION</u></b>
<P>

<b>	<u>Submissions</u></b>
<P>

64	The plaintiff's claim for rectification was pursued only if cl.6.1 was given
a more limited operation than submitted by the plaintiff.

intention given by the plaintiff's representatives.  He submitted that it
should be inferred that
Phillip McClelland had a similar intention.  
<P>

	<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

65	Although my finding as to the construction of cl.6.1 may be slightly
narrower than that sought by the plaintiff, in my opinion
no case is made out
for rectification.  The evidence falls far short of showing a common continuing
intention for any term wider
than that which I have found.  
<P>

	<b><u>REPUDIATION</u></b>
<P>

<b>	<u>Submissions</u></b>
<P>

66	Mr. Sullivan submitted that repudiation occurs when a party evinces an
intention no longer to be bound by the contract:  <u>Progressive Mailing House
v. Tabali</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20157%20CLR%2017" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 157 CLR 17</a> at 33.  The same principles apply to contracts
of employment:  <u>Automatic Fire Sprinklers v. Watson</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1946/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1946] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281946%29%2072%20CLR%20435" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1946) 72 CLR 435</a>,
<u>Turner v. Australian Coal &amp; Shale Employees' Federation</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1984/275.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] FCA 275</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%2055%20ALR%20635" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 55
ALR 635</a> at 647.  The letter of 22nd June 1992 must be viewed in the light of
two previous letters, those of 17th January 1992 and 26th May
1992.  Those
letters, which attempted to undermine the position of Mr. Rogers, a senior
long-standing employee of D-E, without adopting
the proper course for
complaints, amounted to a deliberate attempt by Phillip McClelland to create a
situation where his continued
employment by the plaintiff was non-viable.  The
letter of 22nd June 1992 must also be viewed in the light of Phillip
McClelland's
conduct in seeking legal advice from Sly &amp; Weigall on or about
19th June:  his lack of recall about seeking such advice was,
literally,
incredible.
<P>

67	As for the letter itself, although it asked for termination, the remainder
of the letter indicated that termination was a fate
accompli.  It expressed an
unwillingness to stay beyond 26th September 1992.  In several places, it
assumed that there would be a
termination of the employment.  This is
reinforced by the accompanying resignation from the Board of Directors.  The
letter was very
reasonably taken as a resignation by D-E personnel.  It was
described as a resignation at the meeting on 23rd June, and Phillip McClelland
did not demur to this description.  This amounted to an admission by him that
the letter truly was a resignation:  <u>Shaddock &amp; Associates v. Parramatta
City Council</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/59.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 59</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20150%20CLR%20225" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 150 CLR 225</a> at 230; <u>Thomas v.

Sullivan also referred to a letter from Phillip McClelland to a Mr. Douque
dated 18th October 1993, which made it clear
that he considered that he had
made the decision to leave the plaintiff.  
<P>

68	Accordingly, the Court ought to find that Phillip McClelland's conduct, and
in particular his letter of 22nd June 1992, evinced
the clearest intention not
to be bound to perform the contract for the remainder of the three-year period,
and hence was a repudiation.
<P>

69	Mr. Sullivan submitted that the plaintiff then accepted this repudiation:
the plaintiff's conduct in allowing Mr. McClelland
to continue physically
working until 8th July 1992, and paying him three months' salary thereafter,
did not detract from this:  <u>Western Excavating v. Sharp</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20ICR%20222" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) ICR 222</a>
at 226.  This was in conformity with the D-E policy to make such terminations
of employment as "creditable" to both parties as possible.
 
<P>

70	Mr. Conti submitted that repudiation of a contract is a serious matter, not
lightly found or inferred:  <u>Smyth &amp; Co. v. Bailey</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281940%29%203%20AllER%2060" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1940) 3 AllER 60</a>
at 71; <u>Grout v. Gunnedah Shire Council</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20126%20ALR%20355" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 126 ALR 355</a> at 370.
Phillip McClelland appreciated he was subject to a service contract for an
unexpired term of years, to which he was bound;
and had sought legal advice
from Sly &amp; Weigall.  The letter of 22nd June 1992 requested termination;
and other parts of the letter,
including a statement as to causing minimum
disruption and an offer to stay until 26th September 1992, made it clear that
the letter
was seeking a negotiated end to the employment.  This was confirmed
by the expressed willingness to treat with the company, albeit
preferably not
with Mr. Rogers.
<P>

71	By its actions, the plaintiff indicated that it understood the letter in
this way.  Mr. Boonstra's facsimile referred to a company
policy not to leave a
manager in his responsibility after it has become clear that he is not
performing or "is willing to leave".
 It was mutually agreed that he would
remain at the plaintiff's offices until 8th July 1992, and then he was paid
long service leave,
holiday pay and salary up to that time, plus a further
three months "termination pay".  This conduct by the plaintiff was inconsistent
with an acceptance of a repudiation.  A significant incentive to the plaintiff
entering into a consensual termination was that the
plaintiff wished to have a
continuing good relationship with other members of the McClelland family. 
<P>

	<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

72	I have noted the submission on behalf of the plaintiff that Mr. McClelland's
conduct, and in particular his letter of 22nd June
1992, evinced the clearest
intention not to be bound to perform his contract.  I should say at once that
the plaintiff is limited
by the pleadings to basing the allegation of
repudiation on the letter of 22nd June 1992, and not on other conduct of
Phillip McClelland.
 Early in the hearing, the defendants had sought to amend
the Defence so as to allege that the plaintiff's conduct as employer amounted
to a repudiation by the employer, which would have justified rescission by
Phillip McClelland.  Such application was opposed by the
plaintiff, and
rejected, on the basis that the plaintiff was not prepared for a hearing in
which the merits of the conflict between
Phillip McClelland and Mr. Rogers was
investigated.  In those circumstances, it is not open to the plaintiff to seek
to bolster up
a case of repudiation by the letter by calling in aid earlier
conduct by Phillip McClelland.  However, I do accept that the earlier
conduct
by Phillip McClelland is part of the background against which the letter of
22nd June 1992 must be considered and interpreted.
 
<P>

73	Apart from evidencing the serious dissatisfaction of Phillip McClelland with
his dealings with Mr. Rogers, I do not think that
the earlier letters bear very
strongly on the construction of the letter of 22nd June 1992.  It was put for
the plaintiff that it
was inappropriate conduct by Mr. McClelland to write
these letters behind Mr. Rogers' back to his superiors in the organisation;
but
that is not relied on as repudiation, and it illustrates a consistency in
Phillip McClelland's conduct between these two earlier
letters, which on their
face were seeking changes in the context of continued employment of Mr.
McClelland, and the letter of 22nd
June which is alleged to be repudiatory.  It
was said that the employer would more readily take the 22nd June letter as
repudiatory,
because Phillip McClelland had not made further enquiry as to the
employer's response to the letter of 26th May, and had not allowed
sufficient
time for any further response.  In circumstances where it is plain from
evidence given by the plaintiff that no response
favourable to Phillip
McClelland was contemplated, it seems to me that Phillip McClelland cannot be
criticised for correctly drawing
this inference, and that the matter also has
little bearing on the construction of the letter.
<P>

74	Similarly, it seems to me that the fact that Phillip McClelland took legal
advice shortly before writing the letter cannot assist
in the interpretation of
the letter.  It was not known to the plaintiff that this legal advice had been
taken.  One might draw the
inference that, having taken legal advice, Phillip
McClelland would have been careful to avoid repudiation; but the effect of the
letter must be considered in the light of the circumstances known to both
parties, rather than having regard to Phillip McClelland's
subjective
intentions.  
<P>

75	For the plaintiff, considerable reliance was placed on the description of
this letter as a "resignation".  I accept that the
ordinary meaning of the word
"resign" in the context of an office, position, etc. is "to relinquish,
surrender, give up, or hand
over".  However, its general use is to some extent
equivocal, in that resignations notoriously are often tendered and not
accepted,
in which case the office or position is considered as continuing.
That is, in many cases resignations are ineffective and known to
be
ineffective, unless they are accepted.  Those resignations would be seen as the
giving up of any claim to remain in the position
or office, coupled with an
offer to put an end to occupation of the position which might or might not be
accepted.  For that reason,
although I am prepared to accept that the letter
was described as a resignation at the meeting of 23rd June and that Phillip
McClelland
did not challenge that description, I do not think this carries very
much weight concerning the question of whether the letter was
or was not a
repudiation.
<P>

76	Turning to the letter itself, I think it is fair to say that the letter made
it clear in no uncertain terms that Phillip McClelland
wished to leave the
employment of the plaintiff, and that he believed that the very likely result
of this letter was that he would
in fact leave that employment.  At the very
least, the letter very strongly sought agreement from the plaintiff to the
termination
of the employment.  The question is, did the letter convey that the
writer would leave that employment, whether or not agreement
was reached with
the plaintiff.  On the whole, I am not satisfied that it did.  The words "I ask
for the termination of my contract"
point very strongly towards interpretation
of the letter as a request for an agreement, not a repudiation.  To some
extent, later
parts of the letter, which appear to treat the termination as
something of a fait accompli, and the implication that Phillip McClelland
was
not prepared to stay beyond 26th September 1992, point the other way.  However,
I do not think that these indications are strong
enough to overcome the force
of the earlier words.  At the very best, they make the letter equivocal, and I
do not think repudiation
should be inferred from an equivocal letter.  
<P>

77	Furthermore, I do not think the plaintiff treated the letter as a
repudiation, and acted to accept it as a repudiation.  For
acceptance of a
repudiation to occur, there must in my opinion be conduct by the innocent party
conveying to the repudiating party
that the innocent party is thereby treating
the contract as at an end.  Normally, to call on the repudiating party for any
further
performance of the contract would be an affirmation; although, if the
intention to treat the contract as at an end is clear, and
the further
performance is in the circumstances insubstantial, affirmation may be
avoided.
<P>

78	There has been some discussion of this issue in the context of repudiation
by an employer, with the employee continuing in employment
for a short time
thereafter.  
<P>

79	In <u>Western Excavating (ECC) v. Sharp</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20ICR%20222" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) ICR 222</a> at 226, Lord
Denning, MR said this:  
<P>

	<b><i>If the employer is guilty of conduct which is a significant breach going
to the root of the contract of employment, or which is a
significant  breach
going to the root of the contract of employment, or which shows that the
employer no longer intends to be bound
by one or more of the essential terms of
the contract, then the employee is entitled to treat himself as discharged from
any further
performance.  If he does so, then he terminates the contract by
reason of the employer's conduct.  He is constructively dismissed.
 The
employee is entitled in those circumstances to leave at the instant without
giving any notice at all or, alternatively, he may
give notice and say he is
leaving at the end of the notice.  But the conduct must in either case be
sufficiently serious to entitle
him to leave at once.  Moreover, he must make
up his mind soon after the conduct of which he complains:  for, if he continues
for
any length of time without leaving, he will lose his right to treat himself
as discharged.  He will be regarded as having elected
to affirm the
contract.</i></b>
<P>

It will be seen that Lord Denning did not regard continued working by an
employee during the period of notice as being an affirmation.
 
<P>

80	In <u>Bashir v. Brillo Manufacturing Co.</u> (1979) IRLR 296, an employee
alleged repudiation by an employer in that the employer refused to allow him to
continue as a supervisor
and instead offered him a job with less pay and lower
status.  The employee was away sick for about two and a half months after this
act of the employer, and accepted sick pay during that period.  However,
throughout the period the employee or his advisers were
saying very positively
that the employee did not accept the new position which the employer had sought
to offer him, and the sick
pay collected was at the same rate as he was
entitled to as a supervisor.  In those circumstances, the Employment Appeal
Tribunal
found that the employee had not affirmed the variation in the contract
of employment, and was still entitled to accept the employer's
repudiation at
the end of the two and a half months period.
<P>

81	Again, in <u>W.E. Cox Toner (International) v. Crook</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20ICR%20823" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) ICR 823</a>, a
long delay in acceptance of a repudiation by an employee was held to have
affirmed the contract.  In that case, Brown-Wilkinson,
J., giving the judgment
of the Employment Appeal Tribunal, noted the difficult position of an employee
faced with a repudiation by
an employer:  by continuing to work for any period
of time, the employee risks affirming the contract.  The judgment went on, at
p.829, to note that "provided the employee makes clear his objection to what is
being done, he is not to be taken to have affirmed
the contract by continuing
to work and draw pay for a limited period of time, even if his purpose is
merely to enable him to find
another job".  
<P>

82	In the present case, in my opinion the plaintiff by its conduct manifested
an intention to have a consensual ending of the agreement,
in a manner
"creditible" to both parties, and not to terminate the agreement for breach by
Phillip McClelland.  This intention was
manifested by the arrangement that the
employment continue until 8th July 1992, and by the payment of three months'
"termination
pay".  This conduct, in my opinion, shows that the plaintiff did
not take the letter as a repudiation; and in any event, shows that
the
termination which was effected was consensual and not termination for breach.

<P>

	<b><u>DURATION OF RESTRAINT</u></b>
<P>

<b>	<u>Submissions</u></b>
<P>

83	Mr. Sullivan submitted that, if the contract was terminated for repudiation,
the plaintiff was entitled to be put in the position
it would have been in had
that repudiation not occurred; that is, the plaintiff would have enjoyed a
period of at least until November
1995 before Phillip McClelland could set up a
competing business.  
<P>

84	Alternatively, it was submitted that the contract of employment came to an
end on 8th October 1992, so that the restraint against
competition continued
until 8th October 1993.  (Because the plaintiff's pleading had alleged a
restraint only until 26th September
1993, it was accepted that the plaintiff
could not succeed beyond that date.)  It was submitted that Phillip McClelland
had requested
termination, but indicated he was prepared to stay until 26th
September 1992; that the plaintiff in substance accepted the offer
to remain
employed until 26th September but relieved Phillip McClelland from his
obligation to work in that period other than up
to 8th July 1992; and that
accordingly, the contract came to an end on 8th October 1992, being the date
until which salary was paid,
albeit performance had been excused after 8th July
1992:  see <u>Csomore v. Public Service Board of NSW</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2010%20NSWLR%20587" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 10 NSWLR 587</a> at
595; <u>Mason Gray Strange NSW v. Eisdell</u>, Powell, J., Supreme Court of
NSW, 22/2/89.  
<P>

85	Mr. Conti submitted that the conduct of both parties manifested an intention
that the employment terminate on 8th July 1993.
 The employment came to an end
on that day, and accordingly so did the contract of employment:  see <u>APESMA
v. Skilled Engineering</u> (1992) 12 ALR 471.  Alternatively, where payment is
made in lieu of notice, in the absence of evidence of a contrary intention, it
should be inferred that the employer intended the termination to take effect
immediately:  <u>Siagian v. Sanel</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/IRCA/1994/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] IRCA 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20122%20ALR%20333" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 122 ALR 333.</a>
<P>

	<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

86	In circumstances where I have found that the contract was not terminated for
repudiation, I need not consider in any detail whether
the plaintiff would in
such case be entitled to damages on the basis that it would have had a
restraint operative until November
1995.  In general terms, I accept that a
party in that situation is entitled to damages calculated with reference to the
position
it would have been in had the other party performed the contract.
However, exactly how this would work out in this situation, I need
not discuss.

<P>

87	Treating the termination as consensual, it seems to me that the intention
manifested by the parties was that the employment should
come to an end on 8th
July 1992.  The objective conduct of the employer was to pay ordinary salary,
holiday pay and long service
leave entitlements calculated until that day, and
to pay in addition three months' "termination pay".  The objective conduct of
the
employee was to accept those payments and to cease attending at the
employer's premises after that date.  
<P>

88	Certainly, circumstances may occur where the contract is treated as coming
to an end after a period of notice, and the employer
waives what would
otherwise have been the continuing obligation of employee to perform services:
that is what was considered to have
happened in the <u>Mason Gray Strange</u>
case.  However, it seems to me that the question is what intention is
manifested in the particular case.  In this case, as I have
said, I think the
intention manifested by both parties was that the employment cease on 8th July.
In <u>Sirgian v. Sanel</u>, Wilcox, CJ held that where payment in lieu of
notice is made, in the absence of evidence of a contrary intention, it should
be inferred
that the employer intended the termination to take effect
immediately.  Whether or not there is any presumption to similar effect
applicable in circumstances such as the present, in my opinion that was the
intention manifested in this case. 
<P>

89	For the plaintiff, some reliance was placed on the offer by Phillip
McClelland to continue to work until 26th September 1992.
 That offer was not
accepted, and I do not think the fact that offer was made effects the questions
of what intention was manifested
by the actions of the parties.  
<P>

	<b><u>DID PHILLIP McCLELLAND COMMIT BREACHES OF CONTRACT?</u></b>
<P>

<b>	<u>Submissions</u></b>
<P>

90	Mr. Sullivan submitted that the evidence showed that by July 1992 at the
latest, Phillip McClelland had decided to establish
a business to compete with
the plaintiff's business in respect of the sale of coffee and tea and ancillary
products in the food services
market.  In furtherance of this plan, he devised
a strategy which included the following elements:  to target existing customers
of the plaintiff; initially to seek to sell only ancillary products to these
customers; to do so as a short-term measure, in order
to advance the ultimate
business of selling coffee and tea, the selling of ancillary products on their
own not being financially
viable; and to engage key personnel of the plaintiff
who had valuable contacts.  
<P>

91	In pursuit of these plans, he had commenced carrying on a business by
November 1992.  That business was properly characterised
from November 1992 as
one of purchasing, processing, packaging, and distributing coffee and tea.  The
breaches were not de minimis:

92	Mr. Conti submitted that Phillip McClelland's activities prior to 8th April
1993 did not extend to the proscribed coffee and
tea activities.  In any event,
what was done was no more than to engage in preparatory acts, not to carry on a
business in competition:
 see <u>Pioneer Concrete Services v. Galli</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1985/68.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] VicRp 68</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20VR%20675" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985)
VR 675.</a>  Furthermore, it was wholly unrealistic to characterise the very minor
sales made by Phillip McClelland as being in competition was
a massive
multi-national corporation.  The plaintiff did not see his activities as being
competitive.  No claim for damages is made
in respect of any pre-9th July 1993
activities.  No damage to goodwill is alleged as flowing from those activities.
Mr. Conti submitted
that tax cases, such as <u>Southern Estates</u>, went to a
different issue.  
<P>

	<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

93	There are some disputed questions of fact which I need to look at in
relation to this issue.  
<P>

94	First, it was submitted for the plaintiff that I should infer that Phillip
McClelland was soliciting customers of the plaintiff
in respect of tea and
coffee business prior to 8th July 1993.  It was submitted that this inference
arises from the Westpac credit
proposal dated 15th September 1993, and Mr.
McClelland's answers in cross-examination to questions about it.  On the whole,
I do
not think I can draw the inference from that document or those answers
that the sale of coffee and tea was actually discussed by
Phillip McClelland
with customers of the plaintiff prior to 8th July 1993.  Quite plainly, coffee
and tea had been discussed with
customers between 9th July 1993 and 15th
September 1993, and other matters had been discussed with customers prior to
9th July 1993.
 It may well be that prior to 9th July 1993 customers had
approached Phillip McClelland expressing dissatisfaction with service provided
by the plaintiff.  I do not think the terms of the entry, the basis of which is
not established with clarity, are sufficient to enable
me to reject Mr.
McClelland's claim that he was careful prior to 9th July 1993 not to discuss
coffee and tea with customers of the
plaintiff.  
<P>

95	The other factual matter concerns the content of discussions entered into by
Phillip McClelland, and more especially Mr. Holder,
with employees of the
plaintiff, prior to 9th July 1993.  Those persons admitted that there had been
discussions with employees of
the plaintiff, but claimed that the discussions
occurred on the initiative of the employees, and involved expressions of
dissatisfaction
by the employees with their employment with the plaintiff, and
no more than indications from Mr. McClelland or Mr. Holder that there
could
possibly be a job for them after 8th July 1993.  However, Mr. Clark, who
managed the plaintiff's business in Cairns until July
1993, and who commenced
employment with Ambassador Foods at about the end of August 1993, gave evidence
to the effect that he was
approached and solicited by Mr. Holder and Mr.
McClelland prior to July 1993, and offered an employment package which he could
take
up after 8th July 1993.  In addition, the plaintiff placed reliance on the
placing of advertisements, in circumstances where all
positions were in fact
filled by employees or ex-employees of the plaintiff, with whom there had been
previous contact:  it was submitted
that this, coupled with the obtaining of
statutory declarations, supported an inference that Phillip McClelland was
trying to hide
the reality of his approaches to the plaintiff's employees.  
<P>

96	In my opinion, I cannot rely on the details of Mr. Clark's evidence.  His
affidavit was made in circumstances where he had recently
been dismissed by
Ambassador Foods for alleged misconduct, whereupon he immediately contacted the
plaintiff seeking employment, and
indicating preparedness to make a statement
about the activities of Phillip McClelland and Ambassador Foods.  That
statement and
the affidavit were made shortly afterwards, and subsequently Mr.
Clark was given employment by the plaintiff.  In those circumstances,
I must
regard Mr. Clark as a partisan witness.  Furthermore, on his own evidence, he
was prepared to solemnly make a false statutory
declaration as to the
circumstances of his obtaining employment with Ambassador Foods.  I also
considered that Mr. Clark, in his
evidence, sought to greatly underplay his own
dissatisfaction with his employment by the plaintiff and the extent to which he
was
actively seeking employment by Ambassador Foods.  As regards the
advertisements and statutory declarations, these may fairly be regarded
as
window-dressing; but this window-dressing was undertaken on legal advice, and I
do not infer that the object was to conceal something
sinister.  
<P>

97	Accordingly, while I am not affirmatively satisfied that there was no more
to the contacts between Phillip McClelland and Mr.
Holder on the one hand, and
employees of the plaintiff on the other, than those persons claim, I am not
affirmatively satisfied that
their dealings with Mr. Clark were as Mr. Clark
claims.  Probably, the truth lies somewhere in between these two accounts. 
<P>

98	As submitted by Mr. Sullivan, Phillip McClelland had probably commenced
business through Ambassador Foods by November 1992, and
certainly he had done
so by the beginning of February 1993.  The question is, was this business
"competitive" with the plaintiff's
business as defined in the service
agreement?  In my opinion, this is not the same question as whether Ambassador
Food's business
prior to 8th July 1993 could be described as a "business of
purchasing, processing, packaging and distributing coffee and tea".
<P>

99	If one confined attention to the sale of relatively small amounts of UHT
milk, jam and cookies to customers of the plaintiff
in the food service
industry, the question may not have a clear-cut answer:  the intersection with
the plaintiff's business might
be thought too insubstantial to amount to
competition.  However, so to confine attention would in my opinion be an
incorrect approach.
 It is plain that these business activities were undertaken
in preparation for a coffee and tea business to commence after 8th July
1993,
and in order to give an advantage in the conduct of that business, particularly
through the maintenance of business contacts
with customers of the plaintiff.
Furthermore, during the period February to July 1993, contact was also being
maintained with certain
key employees of the plaintiff, with a view to the
possible employment of those persons in a coffee and tea business after 8th
July
1993.  When one puts all those elements together, it seems to me that,
despite the relatively small quantities of products sold,
and despite the
entire absence from these products of coffee and tea, the business of
Ambassador Foods during that period can correctly
be regarded as being
competitive with the plaintiff's business, that business being as I have
determined earlier in this judgment.
 In my opinion, it went beyond being mere
preparation for later competition.
<P>

	<b><u>DID MR. BANKS BREACH HIS CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT?</u></b>
<P>

<b>	<u>Submissions</u></b>
<P>

100	It was submitted by Mr. Sullivan that I should accept the evidence of Mr.
Hobbs that on 19th August 1993 he heard Mr. Banks
introducing Mr. Bellchambers
to the Food &amp; Beverage Manager and the Catering Manager at the Hyatt Hotel,
Coolum, Queensland,
which was a customer of the plaintiff, and that he heard
Mr. Bellchambers say words to the effect that Mr. Banks was joining McClellands
and that they would come back and see them after he had done so.  He submitted
that this evidence should be preferred over Banks'
denial of any such
conversation and of knowledge that Mr. Bellchambers was about to be employed by
Ambassador Foods; and that it
should be inferred that Mr. Banks took Mr.
Bellchambers along in order to promote the business of Ambassador Foods, which
he was
shortly to join.  He submitted that I should reject Mr. Banks' evidence
that he simply took Mr. Bellchambers, who was then unemployed,
along because he
thought he would like a drive and to see some of his old customers.  Mr.
Sullivan submitted that this conclusion
was also supported by evidence from Mr.
Hill, and a document of 30th August 1993 recording employment of Mr. Banks,
this being inconsistent
with Mr. Banks' evidence that he was not offered a job
until after 1st September 1993.  
<P>

101	Mr. Sullivan submitted that such conduct by Mr. Banks was a breach of
fidelity and good faith to his employer:  see <u>Blyth Chemicals v.
Bushnell</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1933/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1933] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281933%29%2049%20CLR%2066" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1933) 49 CLR 66</a> at 81; <u>Wessex Dairies v.

80</a> at 84.
<P>

102	Mr. Conti submitted that I should accept the evidence of Mr. Banks and Mr.
Bellchambers.
<P>

	<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

103	On the balance of probabilities, for the reasons advanced by Mr. Sullivan,
I find that Mr. Banks did take Mr. Bellchambers to
the Hyatt at Coolum for the
purpose of advancing the interests of Ambassador Foods.  That was a breach of
his contract of employment,
although as conceded for the plaintiff, not one
which resulted in any damage being caused to the plaintiff.  
<P>

	
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>	<u>LIABILITY OF FIRST AND SECOND DEFENDANTS</u></b>
<P>

<b>	<u>Submisions</u></b>
<P>

104	Mr. Sullivan submitted that a knowing and intentional interference by the
first and second defendants with the plaintiff's contractual
rights without
justification was an actionable tort, if the interference causes damage to the
plaintiff:  <u>Davies v. Nyland</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%2010%20SASR%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 10 SASR 76</a> at 98; <u>D.C. Thompson
&amp; Co. v. Deakin</u> (1952) Ch. 646 at 694.  Any active step taken by a
defendant, having knowledge of the contract, by which he facilitates a breach
is sufficient:  <u>British Motor Trade Association v. Salvadori</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281949%29%20Ch%20556" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1949) Ch.
556</a> at 565.  So far as knowledge was concerned, it was sufficient that the
defendant had sufficient knowledge of the contract to know
that it was
hindering or preventing its performance:  <u>J.T. Stratford &amp; Son v.
Lindley</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281965%29%20AC%20269" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1965) AC 269</a>; <u>Greig v. Insole</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%203%20AllER%20449" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 3 AllER 449</a>; <u>Boral
Bricks (NSW) v. Frost</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20ATR%2080%2d097" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) ATR 80-097</a> at 68,608; <u>Woolley v.
Dunford</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%203%20SASR%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) 3 SASR 243</a> at 270; <u>Emerald Construction Co. v.
Lowthian</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%201%20WLR%20691" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 1 WLR 691.</a>  In the present case, the first and second
defendants were the alter ego of Phillip McClelland, and must be taken to have
known what
he knew.  He knew that it was a breach by him of contract for a
company with which he was associated to carry on a competitive business;
and
accordingly so did the first and second defendants.
<P>

	<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

105	In my opinion, the elements of this tort are made out against Ambassador
Foods, if not the first defendant, except for the requirement
of knowledge that
the plaintiff's contractual rights were being interfered with.  In my view, the
cases referred to by Mr. Sullivan
show that the relevant question is whether
the defendants had sufficient knowledge of the contract to know that they were
hindering
or preventing its performance:  see <u>Woolley v. Dunford</u> at 270.
I am not affirmatively satisfied that Phillip McClelland knew or believed that
he was acting in breach of contract:  he had
sought legal advice, and I think
that, on the basis of that advice, he believed he was not breaching his
contract.  I have taken
a view different from that legal advice, whether
because I have acted on more complete material than was supplied to Mr.
McClelland's
solicitors or have come to a different view as to the correct
application of the law; but that does not alter the fact that Mr. McClelland
had legal advice and was apparently acting in accordance with it.  That, of
course, does not prevent his actions being in breach
of contract; but I think
it is sufficient to prevent the actions of his companies from being intentional
interference with the contract.
 
<P>

106	For that reason, I do not think the plaintiff is entitled to succeed
against those defendants.  
<P>

	<b><u>LIABILITY OF MR. HOLDER</u></b>
<P>

107	In my opinion, much the same considerations apply to Mr. Holder.  I am not
satisfied that he knew or believed that what was
being done was a breach of Mr.
McClelland's contract.  In those circumstances, I do not think he is liable for
the tort of intentional
interference with that contract.
<P>

	<b><u>DAMAGES</u></b>
<P>

<b>	<u>Submissions</u></b>
<P>

108	Mr. Sullivan submitted that the plaintiff should be awarded that amount
which would  put it in the position it would have been
had Mr. McClelland not
breached the contract:  <u>Gates v. City Mutual</u> (1986) 160 CLR 1 at 11-12;
<u>Commonwealth v. Amann Aviation</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/54.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 54</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20174%20CLR%2064" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 174 CLR 64</a> at 80-83.  He submitted
that the plaintiff was entitled to damages as calculated in a report of Mr.
Bryant obtaining a calculation
of profit lost by the plaintiff up to 31st March
1996 of just under $2.9 million.  The date was selected by adding four months
to
the date of November 1995 arrived at assuming repudiation, this four months
being a springboard period:  see <u>United States Surgical Corporation v.
Hospital Products International</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%202%20NSWLR%20766" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 2 NSWLR 766</a> at 815.  There should be
no discount for the chance that sales would have been lost in any event;
however, if the Court considered
there was such a chance, then there should be
a reduction by the percentage attributed to that chance:  <u>Malec v. J.C.
Hutton</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20638" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 169 CLR 638</a> at 643; <u>Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic
Affairs v. Liang</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20185%20CLR%20259" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 185 CLR 259</a> at 277-8; <u>Commonwealth v. Amann
Aviation</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/54.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 54</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20174%20CLR%2064" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 174 CLR 64</a> at 95-8.  
<P>

109	Additionally, the plaintiff was entitled to the costs of recruitment,
relocation and training involved in replacing the staff
who left the plaintiff
to go to Ambassador Foods.  
<P>

110	Mr. Conti submitted that it had not been shown that, but for the activities
of Mr. McClelland, the customers claimed to be lost
would have stayed with the
plaintiff.  The business was a highly competitive one.  It appeared that by May
1992, the plaintiff was
already losing substantial business.  Its largest
customer Ansett was lost to a competitor, Robert Timms, this occurring
gradually
after July 1992 and being complete by January 1994.  There was no
specific contract which the plaintiff could show it would have
had, as was the
case in <u>Amann Aviation</u>.  
<P>

	<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

111	The hearing was conducted before me on the basis that I would determine the
principles on which damages should be assessed,
but not quantify the damages
themselves.  
<P>

112	In order to assess damages, it is necessary to ask what would have
happened, but for Phillip McClelland's breach of contract.
 Since the breach
which I have found is the breach of conducting a business competitive with the
plaintiff's business up to 8th July
1993, and not the repudiatory breach
claimed by the plaintiff, it is clear that damages must be calculated on a far
more limited
basis than that contemplated by Mr. Banks' report.  No case has
been made out that, but for the breach which I have found, Phillip
McClelland
would not have competed with the plaintiff's business from 9th July 1993, as I
have held he was entitled to do.  No finding
has been sought, and I could not
make a finding, that he would not  have gone into business as from that date,
on the same scale
as he actually did, and using the same resources and much the
same personnel.  Had it not been for the conduct of the business of
selling
ancillary products, and in particular selling them to customers of the
plaintiff, I would not have regarded such contacts
with the plaintiff's
employees as have been proved as being breaches of Phillip McClelland's
contract, so there seems to me to be
no basis for saying that these people
would not have left the plaintiff and joined Mr. McClelland in any event.  I am
satisfied on
the evidence that they were most dissatisfied with their
employment by the plaintiff, and were very willing to join Mr. McClelland.
 At
the very best, one might say there was a very small chance that these things
would not have happened.  
<P>

113	However, I accept that the breaches which did occur through the sale of
ancillary products, in particular to customers of the
plaintiff, did give Mr.
McClelland and Ambassador an advantage (and the plaintiff a corresponding
disadvantage) when they commenced
selling coffee and tea products after 8th
July 1993.  It is very difficult to quantify the disadvantage caused to the
plaintiff.
 In substance, Ambassador had been conducting business, which I have
found to be in breach of the covenant, for at least five months
prior to 8th
July 1993.  Because of the very limited nature of that business, and the
complete absence of coffee and tea products,
this cannot be regarded as giving
a five month advantage to Mr. McClelland and his companies as at 8th July 1993.
At one stage, I
thought that the <u>Armory v. Delamirie</u> principle might
apply, so that the difficulties of calculation brought about by Mr.
McClelland's breach of contract should not operate
at all to the disadvantage
of the plaintiff.  However, on reflection that principle really only applies
with full force where there
is a difficulty caused by failure to give evidence
which could have been given, along the lines of the <u>Jones v. Dunkel</u>
principle, rather than problems of calculation because of the fact situation
brought about by the defendants' conduct.  I think the
correct approach is to
hold that the onus lies on the plaintiff to prove loss, but that in
circumstances where substantial loss is
proved, but is very difficult to
quantify, the Court has to do its best; and where the difficulty of calculation
is brought about
by the defendant's conduct, the Court should try to ensure
that this does not unfairly disadvantage the plaintiff.
<P>

114	Plainly, it would be wrong to limit the plaintiff to damages caused up to
8th July 1993, or for the first few months after 8th
July 1993, by Ambassador's
competition.  Doing the best I can, I consider that Mr. McClelland and
Ambassador have in substance put
themselves in the position they would have
been in if Mr. McClelland had been bound by a covenant only for about nine or
ten months,
rather than the full twelve months.  The result is as if the
plaintiff had faced full competition commencing two to three months
earlier
than it would have, if the covenant had been complied with.  One way of looking
at this would be to say that the plaintiff
should be put in the position it
would have been in if every loss caused by competition from Ambassador Foods
had happened about
two or three months later than it actually did.  Another
approach would be to chose a two or three month period at a time when
Ambassador's
sales were in full flight, to assess the plaintiff's loss of
profits due to competition from Ambassador during that period of two
or three
months, and to add to this damages on the basis that losses caused by
competition with Ambassador up to that time would
all have occurred two or
three months later than they actually did.
<P>

115	I think the best way to give effect to this general approach, without
causing too much difficulty of calculation and without
unfairness to either
party, would be to select a three-month period about two or three years after
8th July 1993, and to ascertain
the total sales made by Ambassador during that
period to customers who had been customers of the plaintiff.  A gross profit on
those
sales could then be calculated on the plaintiff's margins, and a further
figure deducted to allow for additional overheads that would
have been caused
by those additional sales.  That calculation would leave out of account the
delay in competition that would have
occurred up to that period, alleged lower
prices caused by Ambassador's competition, the chance that the plaintiff would
have made
sales to other customers of Ambassador, and any chance that
competition would not have occurred in much the same way as it did. 
Those
matters I would consider to be balanced by the selection of three months rather
than two months as the relevant period.  Interest
would then be awarded as from
the end of that three month period.  No damages would be awarded for the cost
of employing new staff,
because on this approach that would have occurred in
any event, although albeit perhaps slightly later.  
<P>

	<b><u>EXEMPLARY DAMAGES</u></b>
<P>

<b>	<u>Submissions</u></b>
<P>

116	Mr. Sullivan submitted that, since the claim against the first and second
defendants was in tort, it was open to the Court to
award exemplary damages:
see <u>XL Petroleum (NSW) v. Caltex Oil (Australia)</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20155%20CLR%20487" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 155 CLR 487</a> at
471; <u>Lamb v. Cotogno</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20164%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 164 CLR 1</a> at 9-10.  Mr. Sullivan submitted
that exemplary damages could also be awarded in cases of contract:  see Friel,
<u>The Law of Contract</u> (1995) at 306-7; Tilbury, <u>Civil Remedies</u>,
Vol.1, par.5009; <u>Paragon Properties v. Magna Investments</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%2024%20DLR%203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) 24 DLR
3(d)</a> 156 at 167.  The conduct of the first and second defendants and of Phillip
McClelland showed a contumelious disregard for the plaintiff's
rights.  The
breach of contract, participated in by the first and second defendants, was
deliberately designed or calculated to cause
maximum harm to the plaintiff.
The plaintiff's customers were targeted, and key employees of the plaintiff
enticed away.  
<P>

	<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

117	As stated earlier, I am not satisfied that Phillip McClelland, and thus the
first and second defendants, knew or believed that
their conduct was in breach
of Phillip McClelland's obligations under his contracts.  In those
circumstances, the claim for exemplary
damages must fail.  
<P>

	<b><u>CONCLUSION</u></b>
<P>

118	The result is that the plaintiff will be entitled to damages against
Phillip McClelland, on the basis discussed above, and nominal
damages against
Mr. Banks, but fails on all other claims.  I think it would be appropriate to
postpone determination of any question
of costs until the damages have been
quantified:  I think it is possible that the quantum of damages will have some
bearing on the
question of costs.
