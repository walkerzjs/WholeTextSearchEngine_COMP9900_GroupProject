<center><b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  
<P>

1   	This matter came before me as duty judge on 15 September
last.  To a very large extent the rights of the parties depend upon
the proper
construction of the Retirement Villages Act 1989 (NSW) and it was agreed that
questions should be formulated defining
the issues which arose as to that
construction and that these should be determined in advance of other issues.
The matter was adjourned
to enable the parties to formulate those questions
with precision.
<P>

2   	Without any attempt to pre-empt the decisions on the issues
which arise, the background to the litigation is as follows.  The
Plaintiff is
the owner of a number of units in a retirement village.  The units are occupied
by the Defendants.  The Plaintiff claims
that it is entitled to more by way of
rent or occupation fee for the use of the units than it has been receiving.
The Defendants
dispute this and have declined to pay.  In consequence, the
Plaintiff has purported to terminate the Defendants' right to remain
in the
units they have been occupying.  It is their rights in these respects that the
parties wish to resolve.  Also involved is
whether this Court has jurisdiction
to determine all matters in issue or whether proceedings properly lie in the
Residential Tribunal.
<P>

3   	The Defendants are elderly, varying in age between about 70
and 93 years.  Some are in ill-health.  Prior to the Plaintiff's
acquisition of
its units, its predecessor in title to them was engaged in somewhat similar
litigation with the Defendants although
there is no suggestion that that
earlier litigation provides an answer to the present dispute.  The Court may, I
think, take judicial
notice of the strain to which the Defendants have been and
are being subjected to by this and the previous litigation and it seems
to me
clearly a case where an order for expedition should be made.  
<P>

4   	The parties' estimate is that with the benefit of the
written submissions which they propose to file, the hearing on the separate
questions should take no more than 3 hours.
<P>

5   	It is for these reasons that I have thought it appropriate
to make the more significant of the orders made this morning and
embodied in
the Short Minutes of Order initialled by me. 
<P>
