<b><u>2384/99 Jobnet Employment Services Incorporated &amp; ORS v ALWYN COPEMAN
&amp; ORS</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>Outline of action</b>
<P>

1   	To an outside observer this claim relates to a battle for
control of an incorporated association, Jobnet Employment Services
Incorporated
(Jobnet), a body funded by public moneys which ought not to be laid out on
litigation of this sort.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

2   	Jobnet was incorporated under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aia1984307/" class="autolink_findacts">Associations
Incorporation Act 1984</a>.  The second plaintiffs claim to be members of its
committee and say the defendants are not members of the committee.  The first
to six and ninth defendants claim to be members of the committee to the
exclusion of the second plaintiffs.  The seventh defendant,
Betty Burke, had a
long association with the organisations the subject of the action.  It is
possible she may claim to be a member
of the committee of Jobnet.  The eighth
defendant, Dianne Walsh, was manager of Jobnet and an earlier body until
dismissed in 1999.
 She claims to be a member of the first plaintiff.  Of the
defendants only the first and second have filed appearances and only Mrs
Copeman has appeared at the hearing.  Mr Smith, it seems, intended to submit.
The defendants other than Glen Donaldson have been
served.  Glen Donaldson has
not been properly served, but in the circumstances that will not matter.
Nobody has argued that Jobnet
was in fact not incorporated.  Orders were made
on 18 June 1999 that certain persons whom the defendants claim were members of
Jobnet
be given notice and that was done. 
<P>

3   	From earlier than 1994 there was in existence an
incorporated association, Western Sydney Community Transition Team Incorporated
(the transition team).  Among other activities it received funding from the
Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services
or Family and Community
Services (the Department) for the purpose of providing pre-employment training
to persons with disabilities.
These it provided under the name of Western
Sydney Jobnet Service and later Western Sydney Jobnet Employment Services
(Western Sydney).
 It seems that at least the latter name was registered by the
transition team.  In fact Western Sydney was managed by a group of
persons
described sometimes as a sub-committee and usually as a management committee
appointed by the transition team.  The Department
would not fund Western Sydney
direct as it would not fund an unincorporated body.  Departmental funding
appears to have been paid
direct into two bank accounts at the Commonwealth
Bank at Penrith in the name of "Western Sydney Community Transition Team Inc.
Jobnet".
 The letterhead paper used by Western Sydney, at least in 1996 stated
it to be funded by the Department of Health and Family Services
and to be an
activity of the transition team.
<P>

4   	In 1997 the Department directed the phasing out of
pre-employment activities and required Western Sydney to provide an employment
service.  While apparently it did not want to do this, it acceded to the
request, and it seems at that stage it became a registered
provider with the
word "employment" appearing in its title.
<P>

5   	At a meeting of the management committee of Western Sydney
on 9 April 1997, there was discussion about what was called re-auspicing
of
Western Sydney, and the management committee decided to look into this.
Re-auspicing meant separate funding in some way rather
than funding through the
transition team.  It was understood that separate funding would require
separate incorporation and that
the two things must proceed together, although
one was through state agencies and the other through commonwealth agencies.  On
18
June 1997 at a meeting of the management committee there was discussion as
to separate incorporation.  It was decided to seek department
approval to
separate incorporation, this having been envisaged in the notice calling the
meeting, but separate funding was only sought
if no open tender process would
be required.  It is perfectly clear from all the evidence of those concerned
that separate funding
could not be obtained without incorporation of a separate
body so that was a condition of funding and there was no purpose in the
incorporation going ahead unless funding was achieved.  In other words,
incorporation and separate funding or re-auspicing were both
required as a
pre-condition for any sensible move from under the transition team umbrella.
At the time of this meeting the following
people were members of the management
committee - Alwyn Gordon (who is the same person as the defendant Mrs.
Copeman), Carl Hoppe,
Betty Burke, Marina Parsons, Sue Chandler, Rob McGowan,
Silvano Bevinetto and Martin Wren.  I will refer to these and other people
by
their surnames.  McGowan, Bevinetto and Wren were not present at that meeting,
but they supported what was decided.  On the same
day as the meeting, namely 18
June 1997, Copeman wrote a letter on behalf of Western Sydney to Mr. Heywood at
the Department.  As
it is of some significance I will set it out:

<P>

Dear Mark
<P>

As the Chairperson of the Management Committee appointed by the Western Sydney
Community Transition Team Inc, the auspicing body
for Western Sydney Jobnet
Services, I would like to request that you apply to the Minister to allow
Western Sydney Jobnet Services
(WSJS) to become separately incorporated.
<P>

WSJS has been operating now the past three and a half years and has a proven
record for excellence in service delivery as a pre-employment
training program
for youth with disabilities.  Recently, WSJS's focus changed via a Department
of Health and Family Services directive
to become a supported employment
program (CETP).  This change in focus comes at a time when the Auspicing body
feels ready to relinquish
it's [sic] responsibility to WSJS and allow the
organisation to expand and meet the new challenges involved in this change
unencumbered
by the restrictions imposed by a community based organisation such
as ours.
<P>

The membership of the Western Sydney Community Transition Team, and as a
consequence, of the Management Committee of WSJS consists
mainly of parents of
people with disabilities and field workers in the industry who generously
volunteer their time, but who, in
general, lack the expertise of business
people who are experienced and more capable of making financial and planning
decisions for
the benefit of WSJS consumers.  The majority of the members of
the Management Committee would be prepared to remain as board members
but all
agree that the influence of members with the expertise mentioned above could
only enhance the service.
<P>

There has been a concern raised that if WSJS is to become separately
incorporated then the organisation must go to open tender.
 The Auspicing body
would be against this move as the risk of becoming absorbed by other larger
CETP organisations in this area is
too great.  The team is justifiably proud of
the ethics of WSJS and of it's [sic] effectiveness for consumers with
disabilities and
would appreciate the opportunity for the status quo to remain.
Therefore, if separate incorporation requires an open tender we must
respectfully withdraw our request to change WSJS's status and continue as the
auspicing body.
<P>

I hope that this letter provides you with adequate information to gain insight
regarding our position and enables you to present
our case to the Minister.  I
look forward to a favourable reply.
<P>

Yours sincerely,
<P>

6   	During the balance of 1997, meetings of the management
committee took place from time to time.  At a meeting on 22 July it
was
resolved in discussing vacant positions that the existing structure should
remain until incorporation.  At that meeting it is
recorded that verbal
resignations had been received from Bevinetto, Wren and Hoppe and that it was
agreed that formal written resignations
should be obtained.  Wren and Hoppe did
resign.  Bevinetto said, and I accept his evidence, that Mrs Walsh, who was the
manager of
Western Sydney, asked him to stay away for a while but not put in a
resignation, she thinking that he had not the conflict of interest
which had
forced the others to resign.  It seems likely the conflict arose because
Western Sydney was required by the Department
to change its activities from
pre-employment training to employment provision for persons with
disabilities.
<P>

7   	A meeting of the transition team on 23 July resolved to
keep the management committee as it was until separate incorporation
was
obtained or the situation changed.  On 17 December 1997, the minutes of the
management committee recorded a resolution that Bevinetto
be reinstated to the
management committee due to the impending resignation of Marina Parsons, such
reinstatement being for the period
from 6 January 1998 until incorporation.
The fact is, however, that Bevinetto had never resigned.
<P>

8   	On 18 December 1997, exactly six months after he had been
asked to obtain approval for separate funding, Mr. Heywood responded
to the
request for a transfer of grant from one organisation to the other and asked
for a formal proposal.  That proposal was prepared
by Walsh and Copeman.  To
the extent to which Copeman said that she had little to do with it, I do not
accept evidence, which was
contrary to that of Walsh.  The covering letter
forwarding the proposal stated in its first paragraph:
<P>

The enclosed proposal details the new dimension for Western Sydney Jobnet
Employment Services (WSJES) as Jobnet Employment Service
Inc (application for
incorporation pending).  We envisage that this will be achieved through a
transfer of grant from WSCTT Inc,
our auspicing body, to a self management
separation.
<P>

It also referred to Western Sydney's ability to stand alone and the desire of
the management committee and staff to expand existing
service provisions into
other areas.
<P>

9   	Examination of the proposal put forward makes it perfectly
clear the intention was that the body to be incorporated and which
it was
proposed would receive the funding would in fact provide the services for which
funding was sought, and would not just be
a new auspicing body to receive funds
and pass them on to Western Sydney.  It is not necessary to set out the matters
in the proposal
which make this clear, other than to say that letters in
support of it, which were presumably drafted by Walsh or Copeman, referred
to
the management committee and staff at Western Sydney being able to operate the
service without being tied to the transition team,
and the proposal itself
referred to numerous activities being carried out by Western Sydney which would
be continued under the new
incorporated organisation.  The entire proposal
constantly refers to "JES Inc" and the activities then being conducted by that
body,
clearly meaning by Western Sydney.
<P>

10   	On 6 January 1998 Parsons resigned from the management
committee.  Its members from then on were Copeman, Burke, Bevinetto,
Chandler
and McGowan.  On 12 January 1998 Copeman signed an application for
incorporation of Jobnet under the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aia1984307/" class="autolink_findacts">Associations Incorporation Act 1984</a></u>
(the Act).  As originally drafted by Walsh its name was to be "Western Sydney
Jobnet, but the first two words were deleted.  The
reason for this was not
explained but it may have had something to do with the proposal for funding
which was in the name applied
for.  Paragraph 2 of the application required the
applicant to state whether the formation was of a new association or a
currently
unincorporated association and in the latter event, the name of the
unincorporated association was to be shown. Copeman did not delete
either of
the alternatives but nevertheless inserted the name of the unincorporated body
which was to be formed into an association.
 I think it is clear from this that
the intention was that a currently unincorporated body was to become an
incorporated body.  As
I have said that is borne out by the proposal for
funding.  Paragraphs 3, 4,6 and 7 of the application as signed by Copeman, that
words in italics being written by Walsh were as follows:
<P>

3.	The objects of the proposed incorporated association are: <i>To provide
training, assessment, job marketing and placement support to people with
disabilities to enhance their participation within
the community.</i>
<P>

4.	The principal activities of the association are/<i>are likely to be</i>::<i>
assessment training, job placement support.</i>
<P>

6.	The number of persons employed/<strike>likely to be employed</strike> by the
association is/<strike>is likely to be</strike>: <i>6</i>
<P>

7.	The persons with whom the association deals/<strike>is like likely to
deal</strike> with are principally:<i> People with disabilities, their
parents/carers.</i>
<P>

 Copeman declared that she was duly authorised to apply for the incorporation
in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/aia1984307/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s8</a> of the Act.
<P>

11   	This form provides a strong indication that the intention
was to incorporate Western Sydney whether properly authorised or
not.  It could
not be suggested anyone other than the management committee, except perhaps the
transition team, and this was never
suggested, was the authorising body.
<P>

12   	Jobnet was incorporated on 18 February 1998.  The
certificate of incorporation was sent to Copeman at the address from which
Western Sydney had always operated.  She said she did not receive it until May.
Walsh says that she would have opened the letter
and that she knew of the
incorporation in February. Copeman said she knew of it in May.  That I think to
be the position on the balance
of probabilities, but I am satisfied in any
event the members of the management committee of Western Sydney were not told
of this
until October or November.  A report of the management committee of 24
March 1998 is not clear on this aspect.  On that date the
committee determined
to follow the Model Rules "if we are granted separate auspicing" and the
manager reported speaking to Heywood
about separate incorporation.  A meeting
of 26 May 1998 discussed "discussions with Heywood on separate incorporation".
All those
involved knew incorporation and transfer of funding were both
necessary.
<P>

13   	The transition team annual report for 1997/1998 included a
report of Western Sydney prepared by Walsh which included the following
paragraph:
<P>

With separate incorporation pending we have some new people interested in
joining our Management Committee.  I believe that the
addition of a solicitor,
a member of the Chamber of Commerce at Blacktown and a bank manager, who is
also the parent of one of our
clients, would add a new dimension to the
Management Committee and enhance the membership expertise which already exists.
Having
members with business/management expertise as well as community members
will be an excellent blend.
<P>

14   	The minutes of the annual general meeting of the
transition team, held on 17 June 1998 which appear to refer to 1997 not 1998
in
various places, which is obviously incorrect, and is probably reproduced from
the previous year, show that the following were
elected to the Western Sydney
"sub-committee"; Copeman, Bevinetto, Burke, Twemlow, Blunden, Scrine and Moat.
These people other than
Blunden and Moat were present at a meeting of Western
Sydney on 12 August 1998.  At that meeting Copeman was elected chairperson,
Bevinetto Treasurer, and it was decided that the position of secretary would be
rotated.  It was decided to hold elections for office
at the first meeting
after separate incorporation was secured.  It is obvious those persons present
intended to hold those elections.
 At a meeting on 23 September 1998 everyone
was there except Blunden.  It was reported that "incorporation was with the
minister".
 The meeting set the next meeting for 3 November 1998.  The minutes
of the meeting of 3 November 1998 were headed "Jobnet Employment
Services Inc".
That was the first time that heading had been used, in the past the headings
for the minutes having been "Western
Sydney Jobnet Employment Services" or
"Western Sydney Community Transition Team Jobnet Sub-Committee".  Present were
Copeman, Burke,
Twemlow, and Scrine.  Bevinetto apologised. Walsh was in
attendance as manager.  The minutes of the previous meeting of 23 September
1998 were read, confirmed and signed by Copeman.  It was reported that the
Minister had approved what seemed to be described as "separate
incorporation".
There was discussion about changing the name of the bank accounts and on the
contract with the Department.  The minutes
record that the directors were
informed of their right to remain members of the transition team until their
next annual general meeting
in May, but that membership of the transition team
was no longer a criterion for membership of Jobnet board of directors.  At this
meeting a copy of the Model Rules was given to each member of the board for
review.  There was a decision to hold an annual general
meeting in January or
February 1999, although a subsequent note put on the minutes by Walsh stated
that it would not be necessary
to hold that meeting until August 1999.
<P>

15   	On 3 February 1999 Copeman gave notice of resignation from
"the board".  The minutes of the meeting on that day are headed
"Board of
Directors Meeting".  The meeting was attended by Bevinetto, Blunden, Burke,
Moat, Scrine and Twemlow. Burke resigned towards
the end of that meeting.
Discussion revolved around complaints of staff about Walsh.
<P>

16   	From this time on confusion reigned. Copeman, who remained
public officer, sent a memorandum dated 22 February 1999 to Blundell,
Burke,
Twemlow, Scrine and Moat, purportedly to call a special general meeting of
Jobnet on 22 March 1999 on the purported request
of five percent of the
members, doing so on the basis that under the Model Rules if the committee
failed to call the meeting then
the secretary was to call the meeting, and
presumably as the secretary had not called the meeting then the public officer
was to
do so, or perhaps on the basis that if there was no secretary the public
officer was deemed to be secretary.  Persons who were said
to have requested
the calling of the meeting as members of the association were Copeman, Walsh,
Burke and a Mrs Crockett.  The purpose
of the meeting was stated to be "to
discuss all issues relating to the treatment of Mrs Diane Walsh and the
validity of the committee
to make decisions on behalf of the members of the
Association".  Mr Butterfield of Messrs. Marsdens, solicitors, wrote to Copeman
on 19 March stating the meeting would not be valid for various reasons. Copeman
responded on 20 March 1999 saying, it seems for the
first time, that the five
persons who had been informed of the meeting" were not members of Jobnet, but
members of the transition
board elected by members of Western Sydney Community
Transition Team Incorporated (the previous auspicing body) and requested to
continue their duties until the inaugural annual general meeting of Jobnet (the
auspicing body)."  She said that the meeting would
proceed but it did not.
<P>

17   	In the meantime the "Board" had met on 23 February 1999
and decided to dismiss Walsh as Manager. Walsh was given notice of
this by
letter of 4 March, which stated her employment "with Western Sydney Jobnet
Employment Services" was terminated immediately.
Walsh has commenced
proceedings for unfair dismissal, but the evidence does not make clear the name
of the defendant.
<P>

18   	Copeman then purposed to call a special general meeting of
the incorporated association by notice as follows:
<P>

<center><b>NOTICE of SPECIAL GENERAL MEETING</b></center>

<P>

19   	There was then further correspondence between Messrs.
Marsdens, Solicitors and Messrs. Simpson Partners, both it seems purporting
to
act for Jobnet, discussing the validity or invalidity of this notice, with a
claim by Marsdens that Mrs Crockett was not a member
and asking for the
Register of Members. By this time it had become apparent that Copeman was
suggesting that Jobnet was an umbrella
body for Western Sydney Jobnet just as
the transition team had been and that somehow or other she, Burke and Walsh
were the members
of the committee of that body, that Mr Walsh was a member, and
that a substantial number of new members had been accepted.
<P>

20   	This extraordinary position is stated to have arisen as a
result of a meeting of Jobnet, said to have been held on 19 May
1998 at the
premises from which Jobnet had always operated.  The persons said to have been
present at that meeting were, Copeman,
the public officer, Burke and Walsh as

Meeting closed at 1.30 pm.  Attending members went for a celebratory lunch.
<P>

21   	In affidavit evidence, Copeman, Walsh and Trevor Walsh
said that they were present at that meeting.  This was not true.  In
oral
evidence it was stated that Mr Walsh was not present but that he had been
contacted by telephone.  At the foot of the copy minutes
which were annexed to
the affidavit of Copeman there is her signature with the date 11 May 1999.  She
explained this by saying that
was the date on which she had handed all the
documents which she held for the company to her solicitors in accordance with
an order
of the court.  As the court order was not made until after 11 May 1999
that was not true.  Neither was it true that Walsh was present
at the meeting,
although the minutes clearly indicate that he was.  The evidence that he was
not there was given after a number of
affidavits were filed and served of
employees of Jobnet by whatever name who stated that he was not there on that
date, and that
there was no record of any meeting having been held on that
date. Burke was not called and I consider it proper to infer her evidence
would
not have supported Copeman. In answer to a question which I asked Copeman about
the membership fees paid for the members who
signed up on that day she said
that she put them in the bottom of her briefcase and had forgotten about them.
She did not tell anyone
on the committee with whom she was in regular contact
of the meeting.  She said that she did what she did in her capacity as Public
Officer, and that after she was told of incorporation it was necessary to press
ahead.  All of this is nonsense.  I have grave doubts
about this meeting and
whether it took place.
<P>

22   	One reason why I have decided not to make a finding on the
meeting is the seriousness of the matter and the fact I was not
asked to do so
by senior counsel for the plaintiffs.  However, the main reason is that there
is no basis to suggest that the meeting
was a valid meeting of Jobnet and I
will explain why.  To do that it is necessary to set out the relevant sections
of the Act as
follows:
<P>

<P>

23   	The extraordinary claim of Copeman is that as a result of
the meeting which she said was held on 19 May 1998 she, Burke and
Walsh became
members of the incorporated association, although it is far from clear from
those minutes that Copeman became a member.
 Any claim by Copeman must be upon
the basis that the application for incorporation was made pursuant to s8(2) of
the Act.  It follows
from this that the first members of the committee must be
those nominated under s8(2)(d) of the Act.  There were none.  On the case
of
Copeman it is not suggested that anyone other than the members of the then
management committee authorised the incorporation of
a new association pursuant
to s8(2) of the Act.  On that basis the members of Western Sydney at the date
the application was signed
must have become the members.  Those people were
Copeman, Burke, McGowan, Bevinetto and Chandler. No notice of the meeting was
given
to McGowan  Bevinetto or Chandler.  In those circumstances the meeting
claimed to have been held could not have been a valid meeting
of members.  It
could not have been a valid meeting of the committee for the simple reason that
it has not been suggested that the
members of the management committee made any
nomination pursuant to s8(2)(d) of the Act.  It follows from this that if the
meeting
claimed to have been held on 19 May 1998 was held it was not a valid
meeting of either the committee or the members of Jobnet.  In
other words it
was a nullity.  It follows again from that finding that any actions taken by
that purported committee or by those
members were invalid.  Thus the claim that
new members were accepted as a result of a membership drive towards the end of
1998 cannot
be sustained.  No meeting of the committee approved those persons
for membership as required by rule 2(6) of the Model Rules.  It
is said their
applications were processed by Copeman, Burke and Mr and Mrs Walsh at a meeting
on 25 March 1999 at which as a matter
of interest the minutes do not show Mr
Walsh as having been present.  A further purported committee meeting of Jobnet
was held on
19 April 1999.  Mr Walsh who says he is not a member of the
committee, was present and in fact put forward a motion.  
<P>

24   	The purported special general meeting of Jobnet took place
on 11 May.  Those persons said to be members present in person
or by proxy
included Copeman, Burke, Walsh, Mr Walsh and nineteen others, one of whom was
Joe-Ben Mattos, whom the membership book
records as having become a member on
11 May 1999, but which was not possible as the purported committee meeting took
place after
the special meeting of members.  The minutes record that as no
member of the Board of Management was in attendance, the motion of
which notice
was given, was changed to a motion of no confidence in the current board of
management and the board dismissed.  This
was carried unanimously.  Then the
"meeting" approved a transitional management committee to manage the affairs of
Jobnet until the
annual general meeting.
<P>

25   	At the conclusion of the meeting of members there was a
meeting of those persons whom members had elected as the transitional
committee.  Walsh was also present.  This was a meeting of a committee
appointed to replace the dismissed committee, yet it is clear
it was intended
to be a committee meeting of Jobnet which Copeman said the dismissed committee
did not control.  It was invalid as
its validity depended upon the validity of
the members meeting.
<P>

26   	In summary I should state that the following matters make
it clear in my view that what was intended was that, whether or
not the
management committee of Western Sydney under the umbrella of the transition
team was strictly an association or a body as
described by the Act, Western
Sydney should become incorporated under the Act and continue as an incorporated
association under the
Act to carry on the work of Western Sydney.  The
resolution of the committee of 18 June 1997, together with the evidence of
those
not present that they supported the proposal, followed by the letter of
the same date, followed by the application for incorporation
and application
for separate funding, and the minutes of the meeting of 3 November 1998 being
an obvious continuation of the meetings
of the old body, but now incorporated,
make this perfectly clear, even if the requirements of s8(1) of the Act were
not observed.
 It is supported by the bank account names being changed rather
than new accounts opened.  In the same way the fact that  the members
of
Western Sydney at the time of incorporation were never informed of the meeting
purported to be held on 19 May 1998, and that the
members were never told that
Copeman was in effect running her own umbrella organisation, in my view make
the finding perfectly clear.
 Even if an association was formed under s8(2) of
the Act, there was never an organisation formed which held the meeting
purported
to be held on 19 May 1998.  It is apparent that whether formed under
s8(1) or s8(2) the members would have been the same.  I have
not overlooked the
Departmental correspondence about two names.  That may have fitted the
Departmental administration but it is of
no other significance.  As it has not
been contested there was no incorporation, I should find for one.  I find for
incorporation
under s8(1) of the Act.
<P>

27   	I should add to end this sorry tale of confusion that
while Copeman may have been actuated by what she considered to be proper
motives, she was a quite unsatisfactory witness, who was unable to give any
coherent account of events which would support her stand
that Jobnet was just a
body receiving funds.  The unfortunate position is that her actions seem to
have been activated by her support
for Walsh after the members of what might be
described as the rival group, purported to dismiss Walsh.  I do not accept her
evidence
that she informed Western Sydney of the incorporation, and I accept
the evidence of the witnesses for the plaintiff that she did
not.  I do not
accept her evidence that her resignation was from the management committee of
Western Sydney.  It is perfectly clear
that she resigned from what was
described as the board of Jobnet.  By that time it is clear members of the
committee were referring
to themselves as the board.
<P>

28   	The difficult question is to determine the present
position.  The only way to do that is to deal with the statutory position
at
incorporation and then to see if any changes took place thereafter.  If I am
correct that Jobnet was formed pursuant to s8(1)
of the Act then the members of
the management committee of Western Sydney prior to incorporation, namely
Copeman, Burke, Bevinetto,
Chandler and McGowan, became members of the
incorporated association.  As far as I can ascertain from the evidence, none of
them
has resigned.  Those same persons became the committee pursuant to s21(a).
If as Copeman says  Jobnet was incorporated under s8(2)
of the Act the same
persons must be taken to have authorised incorporation and therefore became and
remain members and there does
not appear to be a committee.
<P>

29   	There can be no doubt that Copeman and Burke intended to
resign from the committee.  Thus as I consider it was a s8(1) incorporation
the
present members of the committee are Bevinetto, Chandler and McGowan, which no
doubt will surprise Chandler and McGowan, but
they can always resign.  Blunden
and Twemlow, although intended to be members of the committee, have never been
duly elected to it.
 The same applies to Scrine and Moat.  I can see no way to
rectify matters to make them accord with the clear intention.  Those persons
whom it was purported to elect on 11 May 1999 are not committee members.
Neither are any of the persons whose names appear in the
membership book, other
than Copeman and Burke, members of the incorporated association.  I should add
that they have all been given
notice and some have claimed to be members.
<P>

30   	It is now possible to determine the questions which arise
on the amended summons by making the appropriate declarations. 
Those which I
propose to make are as follows:
<P>

1.	Declare that Silvano Bevinetto is a member of the committee of the first
plaintiff and that Blunden and Twemlow are not members
of the committee.
<P>

2.	Declare that the first, fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth and ninth defendants
are not members of the committee of the first plaintiff.
<P>

3.	Declare that the first defendant and the second defendant are members of the
plaintiff and that the eighth defendant is not a
member of the first
plaintiff.
<P>

4.	Declare the purported meetings of the first plaintiff held on 19 May 1998
and 11 May 1999 were not valid meetings and are of
no effect
<P>

5.	Declare that the eighth defendant was an employee of the first plaintiff
when she was dismissed on or about 4 March 1999.
<P>

6.	Declare that the persons listed in paragraph 6 of the amended summons are
not members of the plaintiff.
<P>

31   	I will hear submissions on costs, but it must be borne in
mind that it is the actions of Copeman and Walsh which brought about
this
litigation.  I would also like to have submissions as to whether it is possible
to make any orders to bring the affairs of the
incorporated association into
order.
