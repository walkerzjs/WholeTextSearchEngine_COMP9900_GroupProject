<b>G910/97 - RE P (OH) AND THE <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">PROTECTED ESTATES ACT</a></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :   </b>On 10 October 1997 this Court granted probate in the
estate of Mrs P's husband to Mrs P.  On 3 December 1997 an order was made by
the Guardianship Board under s 22A of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">Protected Estates Act 1983</a> whereby
the management of Mrs P's estate was committed to the Protective Commissioner.
At the time that order was made the estate
of P was not fully administered.

<P>

2	In about November 1997 one of P's children commenced proceedings under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act 1982</a> in respect of P's estate.
<P>

3	The Protective Commissioner wishes to delegate to the Public Trustee Mrs P's
executorship pursuant to s 75A(2) of the Wills <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Act
1898</a>.  The matter has been referred to me as the Judge administering this List
to approve that practice.
<P>

4	It would seem in England that when an executor becomes incapacitated and
there has been the appointment of a person generally
to administer the estate
that a fresh grant of administration is made to that person for the use of the
incapable person as long
as she remains incapable, though the first grant is
not impounded:  <b>Re Cooke </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1895%5d%20P%2068" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1895] P 68</a>, 69.
<P>

5	The same procedure has been applied in New South Wales;  see Geddes Rowland
&amp; Studdert <b>Wills Probate and Administration Law in NSW </b>(LBC, Sydney,
1996) p 798.  
<P>

6	However, s 75A of the Wills <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Act</a> appears to provide
a simpler and less expensive method of proceeding.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/s75a.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 75A(2)</a> permits an
executor who has obtained probate whether or not he or she has acted in the
administration of the estate, by deed to appoint
the Public Trustee to be
executor in that person's stead.  
<P>

7	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 38</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a>, requires deeds to be signed.
However, although the section does not explicitly say so, it is quite clear
that the pre-existing law
that a deed may be signed by a duly authorised
attorney continues to apply.  This is made clear by sections such as 159 and
163 of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>.  In England a committee may execute a deed on
behalf of a mentally incapable person and the signature of the committee acting
on
behalf of the incapable person is deemed to be the signature of the
incapable person;  see <b>Lawrie v Lees </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281881%29%207%20AC%2019" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1881) 7 App Cas 19</a>, 28.  
<P>

8	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 24</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">Protected Estates Act 1983</a> provides that in respect of the
estate of a protected person which has been committed to the Protective
Commissioner, the Commissioner
may exercise all functions necessary and
incidental to its management and care and such other functions as the Court may
authorise
the Protective Commissioner to have or exercise.  In <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">subsection 2</a> a
list of 16 particular powers is set out, but this is clearly stated to be
without limiting the generality of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 24(1).</a>  None of the specific powers,
however, relates to situations where the protected person is an executor.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/s71.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 71</a> deals with the case where a power is vested in a protected person as
a trustee or guardian, but I agree with the tentative view of
the Protective
Commissioner that this does not extend to the situations where the incapable
person is an executor of an unadministered
estate.
<P>

9	Although the contemplated deed requires the Protective Commissioner to act
not so much in connection with the estate, but rather
in connection with
property over which the incapable person has control as executor, in my view <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
24(1)(b)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/pea1983200/" class="autolink_findacts">Protected Estates Act</a> is sufficiently wide to give the Court
power to authorise the Protective Commissioner to have the powers to execute
the deed required
under s 75A of the Wills <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Act</a>.
<P>

10	Accordingly, I authorise the Protective Commissioner to execute the proposed
deed appointing the Public Trustee as executor of
the estate of P in lieu of
the incapable person.
<P>

11	As, unless an order is made in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> proceedings, Mrs P
is the sole beneficiary, there does not appear to be any need to comply with s
75A(4) of the Wills <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Act</a>.
