<b><u>NO.55003 OF 1999</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>DORAN CONSTRUCTIONS PTY LIMITED (IN LIQUIDATION) (RECEIVER AND MANAGER
APPOINTED)  v  BERESFIELD ALUMINIUM PTY LIMITED</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The question for determination now is whether the
awards of the arbitrator were nullities by virtue solely of the
fact that prior
to the publication of the awards the plaintiff entered into liquidation.
Section 500(2) of the Corporations Law provides
relevantly:
<P>

<b><i>After the passing of the resolution for voluntary winding up no action or
other civil proceedings shall be proceeded with ... against
the company except
by leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court
imposes.</i></b>
<P>

2  	The expression "the Court" is defined in s 58AA.  The present
argument has proceeded on the agreed basis that there was a resolution
for the
voluntary winding up of the company passed on 24 December 1997.  There were two
relevant awards, both after that date.  After
the second of those awards was
published a receiver was appointed to the plaintiff company on 22 January 1999.
It is the receiver
who now wishes to attack the awards on various bases.  The
question now posed for determination arose before I had embarked on any
details
of the disputes relating to those several bases for attacking the awards.  
<P>

3  	I take it that the correct approach to the question of the proper
construction of s 500(2) of the Corporations Law is that described
by Glass JA
in <b>National Mutual Fire Insurance Limited v Commonwealth of Australia</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%201%20NSWLR%20400" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 1 NSWLR 400</a> at 408.  His Honour said that it was encouragement to error
to investigate whether a particular statute such as s 500(2) of the
Corporations
Law is mandatory or directory in its terms by assimilating it to
other statutory requirements of like kind and then noting whether
these have
been held to be mandatory or directory by nature.
<P>

4  	A little later his Honour said:
<P>

<b><i>By having regard to the nature of the pre-condition, its place in the
legislative scheme and the extent of the failure to observe
the requirement,
the question is posed as a matter of construction whether there was a
legislative intention that such a failure
should nullify the act in
question.</i></b>
<P>

5  	Here the pre-condition is the requirement in s 500(2) to obtain
the leave of the Court before proceeding with the arbitration.
 It seems that
the arbitrator had heard evidence for a long time, I gather for some weeks, and
that a further period of time had
elapsed, so that the time had come when it
was thought that he was about to publish his award, when there was a resolution
for the
voluntary winding up of the plaintiff company.  Thereafter the
arbitrator published his first award.
<P>

6  	In <b>Re Sydney Formworks Pty Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281965%29%20NSWLR%20646" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1965) NSWLR 646</a>,
McLelland CJ in Eq, dealt with a predecessor of s 500 of the Corporations Law.
At pp 649-650 his Honour considered the obvious intention
of the section and
said that it was to ensure that the assets of the company in liquidation will
be administered in accordance with
the provisions of the Companies Act and that
no person will get a benefit to which under these provisions he is not properly
entitled
and to enable the Court effectively to supervise all claims brought
against the company which is being wound up.  There are other
authorities to
the same general effect. 
<P>

7  	At first blush the situation which had arisen in this case was
that the arbitrator, having heard for a very long time evidence
and submissions
in relation to a series of hotly disputed questions, was about to publish his
award.  I do not think it is relevant
but I really cannot imagine that the
liquidator would not want to know what the arbitrator thought, or that any
judge, if asked at
that stage, would have failed to grant leave to proceed to
publish the award.  It would, of course, be necessary to obtain leave
to
enforce the award.
<P>

8  	However, the matter is not that simple because the plaintiff,
through the receiver, now contends that the arbitrator had to
rule upon one
outstanding procedural matter, and further that the arbitrator had been guilty
of certain misconduct which, if the
arbitrator was to publish an award, would
have meant that it was likely to be set aside, unless the misconduct was first
cured.
<P>

9  	I do not think either of those circumstances, assuming they
existed, changes the way in which a court should approach the question
of the
proper construction of s 500(2).  Looking at that section in its place in the
legislative scheme and accepting what McLelland
J said in <b>Re Sydney
Formworks Pty Limited</b>, it does not seem to me that the legislative
intention disclosed was that an act taken in contravention of s 500(2) would,
by virtue
of those circumstances alone, be a nullity. 
<P>

10  	In the course of submissions various factual examples have been
raised which point in my respectful view to the absurdity of
the proposition
that the legislative intention was that the delivery of the award would be a
nullity.  One has only to think of instances
such as a judge about to deliver a
judgment just before that judge had to retire upon attaining the age of
seventy-two, or a judge
or a magistrate or an arbitrator about to go away
overseas on leave for some months, or such a person advised that he or she had
a terminal illness, to wonder whether Parliament should be thought to have had
the intention for which the plaintiff contends.
<P>

11  	The plaintiff sought to take comfort from the decision of the
High Court in <b>Emanuele v Australian Securities Commission</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20144%20ALR%20359" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 144 ALR
359.</a>  In that case, however, the High Court was considering a different
provision in the Corporations Law, the language of which was very
different.
One could say the same about the result in <b>National Mutual Fire Insurance Co
v The Commonwealth of Australia</b>, but each of these cases turns upon the
construction of an individual section. 
<P>

12  	In the result I hold that the awards of the arbitrator are not
nullities by reason only of the fact that there had been a resolution
passed
for the voluntary winding up of the plaintiff company before the awards had
been published.
