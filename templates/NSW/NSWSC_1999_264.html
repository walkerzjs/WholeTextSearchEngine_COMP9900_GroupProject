<b>5173/98  -  ADVANCE FITNESS CORPORATION PTY LTD  V  BONDI DIGGERS MEMORIAL
&amp; SPORTING CLUB LTD</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>	Introduction</b>
<P>

1	This is an expedited matter in which the plaintiff as tenant seeks an unusual
form of relief against the defendant as landlord.
 By way of principal relief,
the plaintiff seeks an order that the defendant provide its consent to Waverley
Council to permit the
plaintiff to carry out such fire safety works as the
Council may require as a condition of permitting the plaintiff to remain in
occupation of the demised premises.  The plaintiff claims to be entitled to
such relief either under the express terms of its lease
from the defendant, or
by virtue of the defendant's implied covenant not to derogate from the grant of
the lease.  Alternatively,
the plaintiff says that if the defendant is not
obliged by the lease to consent to the works, it is at least obliged by an
implied
contractual term to co-operate, or not to refuse to co-operate
unreasonably or for an extraneous purpose.
<P>

2	For reasons which I shall give, my opinion is that the plaintiff has failed
to identify any duty owing by the defendant which
would entitle the plaintiff
to the principal relief which it seeks.  However, I propose to make findings on
the issues of fact which
arose at the hearing, in case the matter goes further.
I shall first deal with the facts, and then the contentions of the parties
with
respect to whether the defendant owes any duty to the plaintiff which would
entitle the plaintiff to an order that the defendant
consent to fire safety
works. 
<P>

	<b>The parties</b>
<P>

3	The plaintiff is a company wholly owned by Mr Keiran Barry, who is its sole
director.  It conducts a health and fitness centre
in the defendant's premises,
232 Campbell Parade, Bondi.  The business consists of a gymnasium on the first
floor with access to
a swimming pool on the ground floor.  The plaintiff offers
memberships for periods ranging from a month to a year.  Members have
access to
the gym facilities and pool, and to circuit classes, personal training and
general fitness programs. 
<P>

4	The defendant is the Bondi Diggers Club.  It owns the building at 232
Campbell Parade.  The building is a five storey building
comprising a car park,
offices, the swimming pool and a caf&eacute; on the ground floor;  the gym, a
cool room, loading dock, cellar
and storage on the first floor;  and bars, an
auditorium, a snooker room, a restaurant and a function room on the second,
third and
fourth floors.  The fourth floor also contains some Telstra
equipment.
<P>

	<b>The witnesses</b>
<P>

5	While much of the evidence at the hearing was documentary, oral evidence was
given by five witnesses.  It is appropriate that
I give my overall assessments
of the witnesses.
<P>

6	I found Mr Barry to be a truthful and reliable witness, as was the gym's
receptionist Linda Ormrod.
<P>

7	The defendant's President, Mr Arthur Dunne, was a generally unsatisfactory
witness.  His oral evidence was sometimes at variance
with his affidavit on
important matters of fact.  For example, in his affidavit sworn on 2 February
1999 he denied aspects of a conversation
with Mr Barry on 30 July 1998, but in
cross-examination he appeared at one point to agree that the conversation took
place as deposed
to by Mr Barry (T51.35, 52.50).  I do not conclude that he
deliberately falsified his evidence.  Mr Dunne is an elderly man.  His
demeanour in the witness box suggested a degree of confusion.  For example, he
found it difficult to locate the correct pages in
the papers which were before
him.  His answers in cross-examination suggested to me that he did not always
understand the questions
and their significance, nor recollect the context in
which the question was placed.  I have reached the conclusion that I should
prefer the evidence of Mr Barry to Mr Dunne's evidence wherever they are at
variance.
<P>

8	Mr Mahony, the defendant's solicitor, is a partner in the firm Abbott Tout.
In the witness box he gave the impression of attempting,
as one would expect,
to recall the facts clearly and accurately.  He frankly admitted his own
mistake in failing to advise the defendant
on the effect of clause 15.1 of the
Headlease dated 23 October 1991.  I found him to be a reliable witness, though
this is not to
say that I accepted every part of his evidence.
<P>

9	Mr Perry, a director of the defendant, also appeared to me to be a truthful
witness.  While his recollection of the events of
December 1998 and January
1999 appeared at times to be vague, this may be because the events which were a
principal part of his evidence
were informal discussions by the defendant's
directors at which views were exchanged and the direction of the defendant's
strategy
was confirmed, but no specific motions were put or carried.
<P>

	<b>The defendant's sale and lease back of the premises, and the sublease to
the plaintiff</b>
<P>

10	In about 1991 the defendant sold the building at 232 Campbell Parade to
companies called Junemar Nominees Pty Ltd and Vitarni
Pty Ltd, and took a lease
back of the building.  It appears that this transaction was a method of
providing finance to the defendant.
 The lease from Junemar Nominees and
Vitarni to the defendant dated 23 October 1991 (`Headlease') was for a term of
ten years from
12 November 1991, with an option to renew for a further ten
years until 11 November 2011.  It contained an option for the Club to
repurchase the building.  
<P>

11	The Headlease contained the following relevant provisions:
<P>

	`5.1 The Lessee will during the whole of the term and otherwise so long as the
Lessee may remain in possession or occupation when
where and as often as shall
be necessary maintain replace repair and keep the whole of the demised premises
in good and substantial
repair order and condition (having regard to their
condition following the carrying out of the works referred to in Clause 15.1 of
the Lease) damage by explosion, earthquake, aircraft, riot, civil commotion,
fire, flood, lightning, storm, tempest, act of God and
war damage only excepted
unless any insurance moneys are irrecoverable through the neglect default or
misconduct of the Lessee. 
This covenant shall not impose on the Lessee any
obligation in respect of any structural maintenance, replacement or repair
except
where the same is rendered necessary by any act neglect default or
omission on the part of the Lessee or the Lessee's use or occupancy
of the
demised premises.
<P>

	15.1 The parties acknowledge that the Lessee has received a Notice pursuant to
Section 317D(1) of the Local Government Act 1919
from the Council of the
Municipality of Waverley and dated 29th August, 1991 requiring certain
improvements to be made to the demised
premises.
<P>

	The Lessee hereby undertakes at their cost to attend to the improvements and
alterations as referred to in the aforestated Notice
to the satisfaction of the
Council of the Municipality of Waverley within six (6) calendar months of the
date hereof and to provide
to the Lessor within the period of six (6) calendar
months aforesaid a Certificate from the Council of the Municipality of Waverley
pursuant to Section 317AE of the Local Government Act 1919.'
<P>

12	Clause 4.4 of the Headlease authorised the defendant to sublease or license
the demised premises on certain conditions.  The
Headlease was registered as
No.E129040.
<P>

13	By a sublease registered No.3558120 dated 29 September 1995 the defendant
subleased part of the building, comprising the gym
premises, to the plaintiff
for a term of four years commencing on 1 November 1994, with an option to renew
for a further period of
three years (`Sublease').  The Sublease contained the
following relevant provisions:
<P>

	`5.1 The Sub-Lessee will during the whole of the Term and otherwise so long as
the Sub-Lessee may remain in possession or occupation
when, where and so often
as shall be, maintain, replace, repair and keep the whole of the Demised
Premises in good and substantial
repair, order and condition.  Notwithstanding
any other provision to the contrary herein contained the obligations of the
Sub-Lessee
contained in this Clause 5.1 shall be expressly read and construed
subject to:
<P>

(a) 	reasonable wear and tear and acts of nature or other cause outside the
control and liability of the Sub-Lessee other than those
which would be covered
by the insurances to be taken out by the Sub-Lessee pursuant to Clause 7.1;
and
<P>

(b) 	the condition of the Demised Premises as at the date of commencement of
the Term.
<P>

6.1 	The Sub-Lessee will at all times comply with all statutes, ordinances,
proclamations, orders and regulations present or future
including the
Registered Clubs Act and regulations or notices issued by any public
authorities affecting or relating to the Demised
Premises but only to the
extent that same arises as a result of the use of the Demised Premises and
provided further that except
as specified in Clause 5.2 the Sub-Lessee shall
not be obliged to perform any works of a structural nature unless caused as a
result
of the Sub-Lessee's use of the Demised Premises.
<P>

8.1 	The  Sub-Lessee by paying the rent hereby reserved and duly and punctually
observing and performing the covenants, obligations
and provisions in this
Sub-Lease, shall and may peaceably possess and enjoy the Demised Premises
during the Term without any interruption
or disturbance from the Sub-Lessor or
any other person or persons lawfully claiming by, from or under the
Sub-Lessor.
<P>

	11.4 The Sub-Lessee will ensure that simultaneously with any persons becoming
members of the Sub-Lessee those same persons become
members of the Sub-Lessor
(`the Club Membership') and that membership of the Sub-Lessee is conditional
upon payment of all fees for
Club Membership.
<P>

13.1 	The Sub-Lessor covenants with the Sub-Lessee: ...
<P>

(b) 	The Sub-Lessor will observe and perform the obligations, covenants and
agreements contained in the Lease No.E129040.'
<P>

14	After taking occupation of the gym premises, the plaintiff adopted a general
practice when signing up new members, according
to which persons joining the
gym were asked to complete applications to join both the gym and club.  The
applicant would pay an application
fee sufficient to cover membership of both
the gym and the club, and the plaintiff would draw a cheque representing new
membership
fees payable to the club from time to time, which it would lodge at
the club's office together with the relevant application forms.
 Initially the
club would process the applications once per month at the monthly board
meeting.  
<P>

15	By a letter to the managing director of the defendant dated 5 August 1998,
the plaintiff's solicitor purported to exercise the
plaintiff's option to take
a renewed lease of the demised premises for a further term of three years.  In
the present proceedings
the plaintiff seeks a declaration as to the efficacy of
the exercise of its option to renew the lease, and an order for specific
performance of the defendant's obligation to grant a new lease.  At the hearing
counsel indicated that there is now no dispute that
the option has been
effectively exercised.  On its face the letter of 5 August 1998 appears to be
effective for that purpose.  I
therefore proceed on the basis that the
plaintiff is entitled, at least in equity, to occupy the gym premises as
sub-lessee until
31 October 2001, subject to the terms of the sublease.
<P>

	<b>The defendant's early dealings with Waverley Council on fire safety</b>
<P>

16	The building at 232 Campbell Parade was constructed in the 1960s and 1970s,
prior to the introduction of Ordinance No.70 which
introduced more explicit
fire safety requirements for buildings.  By the 1990s, its non-compliance with
Council's requirements had
become a matter of concern for the Council.
<P>

17	On 29 August 1991, well before the plaintiff took possession of the gym
premises, the defendant was served with a notice under
s.317D of the Local
Government Act 1919 requiring building works to be done to ensure that adequate
provision for fire safety was
made in the building.  The specified work related
to the following matters:
<P>

	* replacement of defective fire safety doors;
<P>

	* installation of exit signs and directional signs, and display of notices
outlining offences relating to fire stairs;
<P>

	* provision of a system of emergency lighting to stairways and corridors;
<P>

	* enclosing of the existing lift shaft with fire resistant walls and ceiling,
and self-closing fire doors, together with a warning
sign;
<P>

	* provision of additional exits from levels two of the building;
<P>

	* replacement of certain doors and replacement of a wall with non-combustible
material.
<P>

18	At the time of service of the notice, the defendant was head-lessee rather
than owner of the building.  As I have indicated,
clause 15.1 of the Headlease
expressly obliged the defendant to attend to this notice.  It did not do so.
Much later, a document
headed `Chronology of Events' which was prepared by the
defendant's solicitor, Mr Mahony, and distributed at an extraordinary general
meeting held on 19 October 1998, purported to explain the defendant's failure
to comply with the notice on the ground that it was
the owners' rather than the
defendant's responsibility to comply with the notice.  That is contrary to
clause 15.1 and was acknowledged
by Mr Mahony in his evidence at the hearing to
be untrue.  The evidence does not make it clear why the Council did not enforce
the
1991 notice against the defendant.
<P>

19	On 13 January 1995 the Council served a further notice on the defendant,
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.139</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government Act 1993</a>, for the purpose of ensuring that
adequate provision for fire safety was made in the building.  The 1995 notice
was less specific
than the 1991 notice.  It ordered the defendant as owner to
prepare and submit to the Council particulars of the works which the
defendant
considered necessary in order to make proper provision for egress in the event
of fire, the prevention of the spread of
fire, the suppression of fire, the
safety of persons accommodated in the building and the prevention of the spread
of fire from adjoining
properties.  
<P>

20	After receipt of Council's order of 13 January 1995, the defendant
commissioned a fire safety report by City Building Surveyors
Pty Ltd, which it
submitted to the Council, and subsequently the defendant executed some minor
fire safety works.  Council wrote
to the defendant on 11 May 1995 noting that
the requirements of its order had not been satisfied, and on 17 August 1995 the
defendant's
secretary/manager wrote to the Council saying that the Club had
attended to emergency lighting and exit signs and had developed a
management
manual and emergency procedures, and was giving induction training to its
staff.  The letter referred to the legal action
then current between the Club
and the owners of the building with respect to the Club's option to repurchase
(see below), and inquired
whether the Council had forwarded a copy of its order
to the building's owner, `to ensure responsibility and liability rests with
the
owner or the Club as lessee'.  Council wrote to the defendant again on 11 July
1996 reiterating its opinion that the building
did not provide a reasonable
level of fire safety and seeking a further audit and a new proposal for
upgrading.
<P>

21	It appears that in light of the proceedings between the defendant and the
owners with respect to the defendant's option to repurchase
the building, the
Council elected not to enforce its fire safety requirements temporarily,
pending developments in the court case.
<P>

	<b>The defendant's repurchase of the building and the Redwood deal</b>
<P>

22	On 5 April 1995 the defendant purported to exercise its option to repurchase
the building from Junemar Nominees and Vitarni.
 The owners refused to comply
the notice.  The defendant successfully took proceedings in this Court to
enforce the option.  Subsequently
there was a dispute as to the price at which
the defendant could purchase the building, the owners claiming that the
building was
worth $7 million.  On 28 July 1996 an independent valuation fixed
the current market value at $4,275,000, and it was agreed that
the purchase
would proceed at this figure.  The defendant found it very difficult to obtain
finance for the purchase, and realised
that if it failed to do so the owners
would be very happy not to sell or to sell at a much higher price.
<P>

23	In this context the defendant negotiated a project management agreement with
Redwood Developments (NSW) Pty Ltd (`Redwood'),
preferring Redwood's
development proposal over one submitted by the plaintiff.  Under this
agreement, which was entered into on 14
November 1997:
<P>

(1) 	the defendant would contribute $800,000 to the purchase price for the
building, and Redwood would contribute $1,325,000 on
the security of a second
mortgage (cl 2(a));
<P>

(2) 	the defendant would borrow the balance of the purchase money, namely
$2,150,000, from the Bank of Western Australia Limited
on the security of a
first mortgage;
<P>

(3) 	the defendant would consent to a development application to the Council
for redevelopment of the building as residential apartments
in Strata
subdivision, with new club premises for the defendant on the ground floor (cl
5(b));
<P>

(4) 	once the development application was approved and vacant possession of the
building was obtained, Redwood would commence redevelopment
and take full
responsibility for the mortgage payments payable by the defendant to the Bank
of Western Australia (cls 8, 9(a));
<P>

(5) 	the defendant was required to use its best endeavours to obtain vacant
possession of the building (cl 6);
<P>

(6) 	on completion of the redevelopment the defendant would be the owner of the
ground floor of the building under the Strata subdivision,
unencumbered by any
mortgage (cl 12);
<P>

(7) 	Redwood would reimburse the defendant, from the proceeds of sale of the
Strata units, its original contribution of $800,000
plus $200,000 for stamp
duty (cl 16(c)).
<P>

24	It will be seen that as structured, the project management agreement gave
real benefits to the defendant once it obtained development
approval for the
redevelopment, and vacant possession of the premises - namely, that thereafter
the defendant would cease to make
mortgage repayments and a development process
would commence which would lead to the defendant receiving new club premises
and a
payment of $1million.  After the Council approved the development
application on 11 October 1998, the only obstacle to the realisation
of these
benefits was the continued occupation of the premises by the tenants of the
gym, caf&eacute; and restaurant.  Therefore
there was a clear financial
incentive for the defendant to remove the plaintiff from its occupation of the
gym premises.  
<P>

	<b>Waverley Council's fire safety requirements, 1998, and the reports of fire
safety experts</b>
<P>

25	The making of the project management agreement with Redwood gave the
defendant access to the funds necessary to complete the
repurchase of the
building.  As earlier indicated, Council had stayed its hand on fire safety
requirements pending resolution of
the dispute about ownership of the building.
That dispute having been resolved, during February 1998 the Council advised the
defendant
that it required that a fire safety audit of the building be carried
out.  
<P>

26	The defendant procured a report by A J Dean &amp; Associates Pty Ltd dated
May 1998 (`Dean Report').  Though it purports only
to be a `supplementary' fire
safety assessment report, the Dean Report is a 21 page document, with 47 pages
of appendices.  The Report
contains a six page list of non-compliances of the
building with relevant regulatory requirements.  Some of the non-compliances
appear
to be minor, but many of them appear to be major structural problems
pointing to such matters as deficiency of construction materials,
the integrity
of service shafts and the construction of external and internal walls.
Appendix C to the report is a list of 69 items
of recommended works, rated
according to their priority, the total estimated cost of execution being
$348,800.  Once again, some
of the items in the list are relatively minor while
others are costly.  For example, one of the recommended works is to provide
conforming
infill constructions to seal openings in the redundant service
shafts in the building, and to protect landing openings in the active
shafts
with complying doors, the estimated cost of this work alone being $70,000.  
<P>

27	Directors of the defendant, together with Mr Mahony and consultants, met
with Council officers on 19 May 1998 to lodge the Dean
Report.  There is some
conflicting evidence as to what occurred at the meeting.  A subsequent report
to Council from the Director
Planning and Environmental Services dated 22 June
1998 states that Council received a request from the defendant's solicitor for
the issue of an order to close the premises, and indicates that the request was
made at the meeting of 19 May 1998.  In their evidence
Mr Dunne and Mr Mahony
both denied that any such request was made at the meeting.  In my opinion,
however, while a specific and direct
request may well not have been made, it is
likely that things were said which caused the author of the report to the
Council of 22
June 1998, David Mumford, to form the reasonable belief that the
defendant requested that an evacuation order be made.  There is
the evidence of
the text of the report of 22 June 1998;  further, the Dean Report was tabled at
the meeting, indicating a need to
spend a very large sum of money to render the
building fire safety compliant;  and the evidence indicates on balance that the
defendant
could not afford to expend any substantial amount on fire safety
repairs.  Little more would need to be said to give rise to an inference<b>
</b>that, there being no other option, the defendant would acquiesce in an
evacuation order.  When one takes into account the fact that
by that time it
was clearly in the defendant's interest to obtain vacant possession of the
building as soon as practicable, as Mr
Dunne and Mr Mahony well knew, and the
issue and implementation of a fire safety evacuation order would achieve that
purpose, it
is reasonable to conclude that Mr Dunne and Mr Mahony recognised
that an evacuation order would suit the defendant and that they
acted in a
manner consistent with the defendant's perceived interest at the meeting.  
<P>

28	By a letter dated 20 May 1998 Abbott Tout acknowledged on behalf of the
defendant that fire safety works were necessary but stated
that the defendant
did not have the capacity to fund the works.  After the meeting a joint
inspection of the building was carried
out by Mr Mumford on behalf of the
Council and Inspector C O'Brien on behalf of the New South Wales Fire Brigades,
who made their
written report on 3 June 1998.  The Fire Brigades departed from
the recommendations in the Dean Report by advocating the installation
of an
automatic wet pipe sprinkler system rather than the upgrading of the existing
thermal fire alarm to a smoke detection fire
alarm system.  
<P>

29	Mr Mumford brought the matter before Council by his report of 22 June 1998.
He noted in his report that the proposed redevelopment
of the building may not
proceed and that it would be unacceptable for the building to remain in its
present state until the leases
of the gymnasium and caf&eacute; expired.  He
reviewed the options available to Council, which included:  prosecution of the
defendant;
 serving a new order on the defendant directing them to carry out
the works recommended in the Dean Report and by the Fire Brigades;
 the Council
carrying out the necessary works itself;  and the Council issuing an evacuation
order to close down the building.  He
rejected prosecution because of the
extended history of the matter, recommended against a further compliance
procedure because of
the club's financial inability to comply, recommended
against the Council doing the work because it would be extremely difficult
to
recover the costs, and consequently recommended an evacuation order.  Mr
Mumford's report indicates that, even if Council had
been stirred into action
by the defendant, it had developed its own analysis of the appropriate course
of action.  The Planning,
Housing and Public Works Committee of the Council
accepted that recommendation on 21 July 1998. 
<P>

30	By letter to the defendant of 24 August 1998, the Council gave notice that
it intended to make Order No.6 (Fire Safety) in the
table to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s121b.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 121B</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979</a>, having regard to
deficiencies in the building with respect to fire safety which the letter
listed.  The list of deficiencies included
structural matters such as a lack of
adequate fire structural resistance and fire compartmentation in the building,
and substandard
egress from the building.  The letter indicated that the
proposed order would require the defendant to submit plans to Council
incorporating
the works described in the Dean Report, with a number of listed
modifications, along on the lines of the Fire Brigades' recommendations.
Abbott Tout replied to the Council's notice by a letter of 28 August 1998.  In
that letter Abbott Tout indicated that the defendant
did not have and
realistically could not raise the funds required to carry out the works;  and
while it may be able to comply with
the notice by submitting plans for a
proposal which it would be unable to put into effect, the defendant was loathe
to expend its
meagre funds in doing so.
<P>

31	Abbott Tout wrote a further letter to the Council dated 4 September 1998,
this time formally making representations under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s121.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 121(I)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental
Planning and Assessment Act 1979</a> in response to the Council's notice of 24
August 1998.  The letter reiterated that the defendant was not in a financial
position
to carry out works of the kind to which the plan required by the
Council would relate.  It expressed the apprehension that in those
circumstances, complying with the notice by producing a plan could amount to
misrepresentation.  The letter submitted that an order
requiring the submission
of a plan would in the circumstances be a futile step.  It suggested that
Council's order should require
not only the submission of plans but also that
the work referred to in the plans be actually undertaken and completed within a
reasonable
time.  The letter suggested that an order expressed in that way
would avoid the necessity of Council issuing a further order requiring
the
works to be carried out, if the order proposed in Council's notice was complied
with by the submission of plans but no action
was taken to implement the
plans.
<P>

32	Notwithstanding these submissions, on 7 September 1998 Council issued an
Order No.6 (Fire Safety) to the defendant requiring
it to submit plans of the
kind specified in its notice of 24 August 1998 within one month from 7
September 1998.  Council's order
noted that if Council rejected the plans it
might prepare its own particulars of works and order the owner to carry them
out, and
if plans were not supplied pursuant to the order the Council could
issue an Order No.10 and/or 11 to cease the use of the premises.
<P>

33	The defendant did not comply with the Order No.6 by submitting plans even
though its failure to do so constituted an offence
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 125(1)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979</a>.  Consequently on 9 October 1998
Council issued an Order No.10 (To Cease the Use of the Premises), that order
being authorised by
the table to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s121b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 121B</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and
Assessment Act 1979</a>.  The order required evacuation of the premises within 60
days of 9 October 1998, and indicated that failure to comply would constitute
an offence.  On 12 October 1998 Abbott Tout wrote to the Council, referring to
the Order No.6 which the Council had issued on 7 September
1998, but not
referring to the Order No.10 which had been issued on 9 October 1998.  Abbott
Tout's letter of 12 October 1998 informed
the Council that the defendant had
instructed its fire safety consultants to provide an estimate of the costs of
preparing the plans
which Council had required.  The letter said that on
receipt of that information, the defendant would seek a contribution to the
cost from the tenants of the building.  The letter stated that as the defendant
had not received details of cost, it was not in a
position to make arrangements
to enable the Council's Order No.6 to be complied with, and requested an
extension of time.  
<P>

34	It appears that the plaintiff became aware of the moves in Council to issue
a fresh notice and orders by no later than 30 July
1998, when there was meeting
between Mr Barry and the Mayor of Waverley during which they discussed whether
the Council's order which
would close the club could be delayed.  On 4 August
1998 the plaintiff's solicitors, Corrs, wrote to Abbott Tout notifying them
that
the plaintiff had exercised its option to renew the sublease and
indicating that the plaintiff had been advised that the Council
was considering
the issuing of an order which would prohibit occupation of the building.
Having received no reply, Corrs wrote again
to Abbott Tout on 12 August 1998
indicating that the plaintiff's inquiries had revealed that the Council
proposed to issue an order
prohibiting occupation of the building in the near
future, because of the defendant's failure to comply with fire safety orders
which
had previously been issued.  The letter said that Council indicated that
in principle they were willing to allow the plaintiff to
continue in occupation
provided that certain works were done, and that the plaintiff intended to
commission a report from a fire
safety consultant to identify works necessary
to put the premises in a state which would satisfy the Council.  
<P>

35	Abbott Tout replied on 26 August 1998 indicating that the Council already
had the Dean Report and the view of the Fire Brigades,
and that a further
report would be superfluous and a waste of money.  In that letter Abbott Tout
stated that if an order were made
for the building to be vacated, then 
<P>

	`any such order will affect our client, as the major occupier of the building,
more so than it will affect your client.  Your client
can therefore be assured
that our client will take all steps and actions which are reasonable and proper
in the circumstances, once
our client has been made aware of the exact nature
of those circumstances.'  
<P>

36	Given the negotiations which had already taken place between the defendant
and the Council, and the project management agreement
between the defendant and
Redwood, these observations can only be regarded as misleading.  In fact, the
defendant had acted in a
way which had encouraged the Council to make an
evacuation order because the president and Mr Mahony correctly perceived it to
be
in the defendant's commercial interest to secure vacant possession of the
building.  
<P>

37	The defendant provided the plaintiff with a copy of the Council's notice of
24 August 1998 under cover of a letter of 3 September
1998, indicating that the
club would make a representation to Council and that it would keep the tenants
fully up-to-date with all
developments as they occurred.  However, it appears
that the club did not give the plaintiff a copy of its representations to
Council
of 4 September 1998, in which (as already indicated) it suggested that
Council should issue an order requiring that work be undertaken
as well as
requiring that plans be submitted, until Abbott Tout wrote to Corrs on 13
October 1998, enclosing the submission of 4
September 1998 together with other
correspondence and the Council's subsequent orders.  Abbott Tout's letter to
Corrs of 13 October
1998 indicated that the defendant did not intend to appeal
against the Council's Order No.10, and that it was not in a position to
fund
the cost of complying with the order.  
<P>

38	The letter referred to clause 6.1 of the Sublease and stated that the
plaintiff must evacuate the demised premises in accordance
with the Order No.10
on or prior to 8 December 1998.  The letter of 13 October 1998 does not on its
face comply with the pre-requisites
for the exercise of a right of re-entry or
forfeiture of a lease set out in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 129</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a>, as Corrs
pointed out in their letter to Abbott Tout of 25 November 1998 and Abbott Tout
acknowledged in their letter of 8 December
1998.  Additionally, in my opinion
clause 6.1 of the Sublease does not apply in a case where an order is made by a
public authority
as a result of the use of the whole building by all of its
users, rather than as a specific result of the use of the demised premises
by
the plaintiff (see letter from Corrs to Abbott Tout dated 2 November 1998 and
letter from Abbott Tout to Corrs dated 11 November
1998).  Further, Abbott
Tout's letter of 13 October 1998 appears to connect the requirement for
evacuation of the premises with the
requirement imposed by the Council through
its Order No.10.  Council subsequently extended the Order No.10 and eventually
withdrew
it for the purpose of issuing a fresh order.  It is therefore
plausible to conclude that the demand for evacuation contained in the
letter of
13 October 1998 has been superseded.  For all these reasons it appears to me
that the letter of 13 October 1998 could not
be regarded as sufficient to
entitle the defendant as landlord to re-enter and take possession of the
demised premises.
<P>

39	By November 1998 Mr Barry had established a line of communication with the
Council.  Mr Alexander Pollock, one of the tenants
of the caf&eacute; in the
building, had also made contact with the Council, as had his solicitors,
Verekers.  The plaintiff and Mr
Pollock commissioned a report by Trevor R Howse
&amp; Associates Pty Ltd dated 6 November 1998 (`Howse Report').  The report, a
document
of some 18 pages, was prepared to provide recommendations as to the
manner and scope of works which would be acceptable and necessary
to permit the
gymnasium and caf&eacute; to remain open.  It reviewed the report by City
Building Surveyors of February 1995 and the
Dean Report, and the views of the
Fire Brigades and of the Council.  It made recommendations on the basis that
the gymnasium and
caf&eacute; remain open but the club premises would be
vacated.  It expressed the opinion that if certain `base building works' and
other works in the tenant-occupied areas were carried out, the resulting
upgrading would afford a level of fire and occupant safety
commensurate with
regulatory objectives, which would allow the remaining tenants to trade in safe
conditions.  The base building
works involved sealing up service shafts with
fire resisting construction, installing some fire resistant door sets and
replacing
lift landing doors, removing combustible material, upgrading the
automatic detection and alarm system by additional smoke detectors
and alarm
bells, upgrading the emergency lighting and installing further exit signs.  The
report did not provide costings for the
work, but clearly the work recommended
would be substantially less expensive than the schedule of work set out in the
Dean Report.
 
<P>

40	The Howse Report was supplied to the Council.  On 2 December 1998 Abbott
Tout wrote to the Council expressing the initial view
that the Howse Report was
`significantly flawed' and indicating that further expert evidence which had
been commissioned would be
forwarded when available.  Then on 11 December 1998
Abbott Tout sent to the Council a report by Stastra Page ECS Pty Ltd,
consulting
engineers, which expressed the opinion that the existing essential
engineering services in the building were no longer capable of
functioning to a
satisfactory performance standard that would provide for safe and orderly
evacuation of the building in the event
of an emergency, particularly a fire
condition.  That report recommended that the building should no longer be
occupied until existing
essential services were returned to full operating
standard, and recommended an emergency warning and inter-communication system,
fire protection of the electricity supply and upgrading of the emergency
lighting and exit signage.  
<P>

41	Notwithstanding the report by Stastra Page ECS, Mr P J Brennan, the
Council's Manager Development and Control wrote to Verekers
on 14 December 1998
responding to the Howse Report.  Mr Brennan said that subject to the consent of
the club, the Council would permit
the occupation of the caf&eacute; and
gymnasium on the following conditions:
<P>

(1) 	all work recommended in the Howse Report be carried out to the
satisfaction of the Council's fire safety officer;
<P>

(2) 	all combustible materials be removed from the rear stair;
<P>

(3) 	the remainder of the building be vacated and all services decommissioned
and all combustible materials removed;
<P>

(4) 	lighting and power circuits be inspected and where necessary, brought into
a good state of repair;
<P>

(5) 	the gas isolating valve be repaired if necessary;
<P>

(6) 	ventilation of the gym and its changing room be investigated and a report
submitted to Council for its consideration, containing
recommendations for any
necessary repairs.
<P>

42	This letter reflects a substantial change of opinion on the part of the
Council.  The Council's notice of 24 August 1998, and
the orders which followed
it, had been made on the basis that the work recommended in the Dean Report
would be necessary, at very
considerable expense.  The difference may be
explained, in part, by the fact that the Dean Report assumed full occupation of
the
building whereas the Howse Report assumed that the only remaining occupants
would be the tenants of the gym and caf&eacute;.  Whatever
be the explanation
for the change of attitude, it was effectively endorsed, subject to a few
additional requirements, by the Fire
Brigades in their letter to the Council
dated 23 February 1999.
<P>

43	Prior to its letter to Verekers of 14 December 1998, the Council granted an
extension of time for compliance with its Order No.10
to midnight on 3 January
1999.  On 8 December 1998 Abbott Tout wrote to Corrs noting the extension of
time, requesting Corrs' confirmation
that the plaintiff understood that rent
would not abate even though it gave up possession of the demised premises
pursuant to the
order, and threatening to seek declaratory relief if
confirmation was not received.  It appears that no such confirmation was given,
but no relief is sought by the plaintiff from the defendant on this
question.
<P>

44	When Abbott Tout received a copy of the Council's letter to Verekers of 14
December 1998, in which the Council accepted the Howse
Report, they responded
to the Council by letter of 18 December 1998 stating that the defendant was
`amazed and extremely concerned
at Council's abdication of its statutory
responsibilities', by making the defendant the apparent consent authority for
the purposes
of the proposed works.  The letter also complained about a lack of
due process in that the Council decided to issue the letter of
14 December 1998
without receiving the further expert report, by Stephen Grubits &amp;
Associates, which Abbott Tout indicated would
be forthcoming.  The letter
expressed the defendant's view that the building would not be safe for long
term occupancy under the
conditions expressed in the Howse Report.
<P>

45	By letter to the Council of 24 December 1998 Abbott Tout confirmed that the
defendant was not in a position to grant the consent
sought in the letter of 14
December 1998, and asserted that the Council's emergency order remained in full
force and effect and would
require the whole building to be evacuated by 3
January 1999.  The letter sought on behalf of the defendant's directors a
meeting
with the Council in the week beginning 28 December 1998.  
<P>

46	In view of the present litigation, the Council wrote to Abbott Tout on 4
January 1999 granting a further extension of the time
for compliance with the
Order No.10 to 28 February 1999.  In that letter the Council stated that it
would be preferable if the auditorium
on level 4 and the lounge on level 5 were
not occupied but if they were, their use and the number of persons occupying
the rooms
should be severely restricted and appropriately supervised.<b>
</b>Abbott Tout wrote to Council on the same day, expressing concern about the
building being left vacant, and seeking an indemnity from
Council if it were to
require evacuation.  Abbott Tout's letter enclosed a report, also dated 4
January 1999, by Stephen Grubits
and Associates Pty Ltd, consulting fire safety
engineers, which reviewed and commented upon the Howse Report (`Grubits
Report').
<P>

47	By its letter of 25 February 1999, Council granted a further extension until
14 March 1999.  Then on 2 March 1999 the Council
wrote to each of the
solicitors for the parties, referring to its letter of 14 December 1998 which
had indicated that with the consent
of the owners, Council would permit
occupation of the caf&eacute; and gymnasium if the work in the Howse Report was
done.  The new
letter referred to Council's paramount concern for the
protection of the public from fire danger, noted the length of time that the
matter had been outstanding and also noted that the owner's consent to the work
referred to on 14 December 1998 had not been furnished.
 The letter stated that
Council proposed on 15 March 1999 to issue a fresh emergency order (Order
No.10) requiring cessation of use
and evacuation of the whole of the premises
other than the Telstra facility on the roof area.  The Court has not been
informed whether
the fresh order has been issued.
<P>

48	The Grubits Report found that the methodology used in the Howse Report was
based on opinion rather than rigorous scientific analysis,
and therefore that
the Howse Report was unable to demonstrate that the statutory requirements
regulating the fire upgrading of existing
buildings had been satisfied.  It
also found that if the building were to be partially occupied the potential
would exist for `fire
scenarios' that could result in structural collapse
damaging adjoining property, causing hazardous conditions for fire fighting
personnel
and threatening the lives of people carrying out maintenance
activities.  The Report also found that the cost of achieving the recommended
level of fire safety would be in the order of $160,000 for base building works.
It annexed letters from a consulting structural engineer
and a consulting
engineer.  
<P>

49	A supplementary report by the same company also dated 4 January 1999
commented specifically on fire safety issues that would
arise if the defendant
vacated the building leaving only the caf&eacute; and gymnasium in occupation,
with the electrical service
to the vacated portion not disconnected.  This
brief report concludes that electrical service failures are a significant
contributor
to fire starts in buildings, and that if a fire breaks out in a
vacated portion of the building due to an electrical failure, immediate
human
intervention will not be available to extinguish the fire.  
<P>

50	Subsequently the defendant obtained a further report from A J Dean and
Associates dated 25 January 1999 (`Second Dean Report'),
reviewing the Howse
Report.  The Second Dean Report found the fundamental approach of the Howse
Report to be generally sound, but
it identified some inconsistencies.  One of
the concerns expressed in the Second Dean Report is that the unoccupied
portions of the
building would be more prone to threats of arson, but no
details had been provided in the Howse Report to address this threat.  The
Report states that the estimated cost of implementation of the proposals in the
Howse Report, together with the additional matters
identified in the Second
Dean Report and in the reports of Stephen Grubits and Associates, would be in
the order of $211,000.
<P>

51	Trevor Howse &amp; Associates responded the Grubits Report and the Second
Dean Report by a further report dated 8 March 1999
(`Second Howse Report').
The Second Howse Report generally concurred with the opinions expressed in the
Second Dean Report, though
it noted amongst other things that the threat of
arson is considered to be an issue outside the scope of fire and life safety
regulatory
objectives.  The Report concluded by confirming the authors' opinion
that the tenants could remain in the premises provided the base
building works
and tenant works which had been identified in the earlier Howse Report were
carried out satisfactorily.  
<P>

52	It is difficult for a lay person fully to assess the conflicting opinions of
the fire safety experts.  In my opinion, however,
the two Dean Reports exhibit
a depth and thoroughness of analysis, and an impartiality of approach, which is
not quite so obvious
in the Grubits and Howse Reports, which rather convey a
flavour of advocacy in the interests of their respective clients.  Since,
however, the Second Dean Report generally agrees with the approach in the Howse
Report, though adding requirements which would increase
the cost of the works,
I believe the correct conclusion is that a way could be found to permit the gym
and caf&eacute; to remain
occupied after the defendant leaves the premises, if
there were a mutual desire to achieve that objective.  But clearly the Council
would need to be satisfied of the detailed adequacy of any such mutual
proposal.  It is not surprising that Council's letter of 2
March 1999 exhibits
a cautious approach.
<P>

	<b>The defendant's treatment of the plaintiff during 1998</b>
<P>

53	The defendant completed the very difficult negotiations which led to the
repurchase of the building late in 1997, after entering
into the project
management agreement with Redwood on 14 November 1997.  Abbott Tout wrote a
long letter to Mr Colin Stokes, the
secretary/manager, on 3 March 1998,
summarising the effect of the agreement with Redwood and making it clear that
it was in the defendant's
interests to obtain vacant possession as soon as
possible.  The letter suggested that the defendant should make arrangements for
alternative club accommodation and commence negotiations with all lessees.  The
defendant proceeded to negotiate a licence to occupy
part of the Bondi Golf
Club, and in due course a draft licence agreement was submitted in November
1998.
<P>

54	By a letter dated 5 March 1998 the Mr Stokes wrote to the plaintiff
informing it that the board of the defendant had resolved
that a new lease
would not be offered to the plaintiff after the expiry of its lease on 31
October 1998, unless the plaintiff exercised
its option to renew.  The letter
informed the plaintiff that the club wished to refurbish and redevelop the
building as soon as possible,
and that should the plaintiff wish to surrender
the lease before 31 October 1998, the club would accept an early surrender.

<P>

55	Mr Stokes and Mr Dunne met with Mr Barry on 6 March 1998.  Mr Stokes handed
Mr Barry the letter of 5 March 1998 and Mr Barry
asked whether they would be
offering any compensation.  When Mr Dunne told him that no compensation would
be offered, Mr Barry made
it clear that he would stay until the end of his
lease.  Mr Dunne advised him to consider moving to the Bondi Golf Club. 
<P>

56	The defendant was approached by representatives of the Bondi Golf Club on 19
June 1998.  He told them that he may be interested
in taking premises there
once his lease expired.  One of the Golf Club's representatives said he had
gained the impression from members
of the defendant's board that the plaintiff
may need to move well before the date of expiry of the lease.  
<P>

57	Then on 30 July 1998 Mr Barry had the meeting with the Mayor of Waverley,
mentioned earlier.  The Mayor told him of the impending
procedure towards an
evacuation order and said that he could delay the order only until the end of
September.  At about the same
time Mr Barry had a meeting with Mr Dunne and Mr
Stokes.  He asked them whether there was any truth in the rumour that the club
would
be forced to close down due to fire safety requirements.  They both said
`no', and Mr Dunne told him that the Council was considering
a number of
options.  Mr Dunne also said he had suggested to the Council that it do the
works and that the club pay it back over
time.  Both Mr Dunne and Mr Stokes
denied that the Council was planning to issue an evacuation order.  They both
agreed to keep Mr
Barry informed.  In his affidavit Mr Dunne denied aspects of
this conversation.  But for the reasons already given, I prefer the
evidence of
Mr Barry to the evidence of Mr Dunne whenever they disagree.
<P>

58	It is clear that in this meeting Mr Dunne and Mr Stokes deliberately misled
Mr Barry as to the current state of their negotiations
with the Council and as
to their understanding of the Council's intentions.  They knew that the Council
had received the report of
22 June 1998 recommending the implementation of a
procedure which would lead to an evacuation order, and that the Planning
Housing
and Public Works Committee of Council had resolved on 21 July 1998 to
approve that course of action.  They were also well aware that
the plaintiff
intended to remain in occupation under its lease and that it had the right to
exercise an option for renewal for a
further three years, thereby frustrating
their plan to secure vacant possession of the building as soon as possible for
the purposes
of redevelopment.  In my opinion the purpose of Messrs Dunne and
Stokes in deliberately misleading Mr Barry on 30 July 1998 was to
delay his
discovery of the truth with respect to the Council's intentions until it was
too late for him to reverse the process. 
When the plaintiff discovered the
Council's intention, Corrs wrote to Abbott Tout on 4 and 12 August.  Abbott
Tout did not reply
until 26 August 1998, and when they did so, their reply was
misleading in the manner pointed out above.  Their delay in replying
and the
misleading nature of their letter tends to confirm the conclusion that the
defendant had embarked on a course of misleading
the plaintiff so as to prevent
it from interfering with implementation of the Council's intentions.  
<P>

	<b>The extraordinary general meeting</b>
<P>

59	On about 13 August 1998 notices were delivered to the defendant
requisitioning an extraordinary general meeting, but the defendant
did not act
on the notices, after taking legal advice.  Then on 9 September 1998 a second
requisition for a general meeting was delivered
to the club's office.  The
purpose of the requisitioned meeting was to consider a proposed resolution
which would seek a report from
the board of the club dealing with, and
providing specific information in respect of, the proposed redevelopment, the
relocation
of the club during the redevelopment, the club's compliance with
fire safety requirements, and the club's financial position and
business plans.
An extraordinary general meeting was convened in response to the requisition,
to be held on 19 October 1998.  The
notice of meeting was accompanied by a
report by the President, referring to the club's financial difficulties and
`traumatic meetings',
and the board's actions in the interests of the
`supportive and loyal members'.  
<P>

60	It appears that at about the time of the convening of the meeting, Mr Barry
noticed a number of changes in the day to day relationships
between the gym and
its members and the club.  At about 7.30am on 2 October 1998, he observed the
club's pool cleaner collecting
money from people entering the pool.  Under the
terms of the Sublease, clause 3.4, the plaintiff had the exclusive use of the
swimming
pool between 6.00 and 8am each day for no charge.  When Mr Barry told
the pool cleaner to stop charging the gym's members, the pool
cleaner said `you
aren't my boss, I'll ask the President'.  For the period between 2 October and
at least 7 October 1998, and possibly
later, the gym members continued to be
charged for use of the pool before 8am.  Eventually the defendant acknowledged
that it was
not entitled to impose such a charge and it ceased to do so.  The
evidence indicates that the charging for use of the pool was authorised
by Mr
Dunne and was in breach of the clear provisions of the lease. 
<P>

61	On about 8 September 1998, after the first requisition for a meeting and
just prior to delivery of the second, the defendant's
board resolved that
applicants for membership would thereafter be given only a provisional
membership which would not entitle them
to vote.  Mr Barry was not told of this
decision at the time, and discovered it only when he read Mr Dunne's affidavit
of 2 February
1998 sworn in these proceedings.
<P>

62	Late in September 1998 the plaintiff submitted 58 applications for
membership of the club from people who had purchased memberships
of the gym.
On about 8 October 1998 Mr Barry was informed by an office employee of the
club, in response to his inquiry, that those
applications for membership would
not be granted, even though the names of the applicants had been entered in the
club's computer
and the plaintiff's cheque had been banked.  The employee told
him that she had been instructed by the Vice-President of the club
to remove
the names from the computer. 
<P>

63	Prior to the annual general meeting of 11 May 1998, the club had admitted
about 80 new members associated with Redwood.  There
is some evidence to
suggest that the processing of these applications may have influenced the
election of directors at the meeting.
 Mr Barry says that a large number of
tradesmen whom he had not seen at the club before, attended the extraordinary
general meeting
on 19 October 1998.  The requisitioned resolutions were not
carried at the meeting, a transcript of which indicates that it was a
lively
affair.  
<P>

64	On 5 November 1998 Mr Dunne arrived at the gym and sought to inspect the
premises without notice.  Mr Barry refused to allow
him to do so, and told him
to contact the plaintiff's solicitor.  There was heated exchange between them.
In retrospect the incident
is a minor one, which was blown out of proportion in
subsequent correspondence between the solicitors of the parties.  If Mr Barry
was obliged to allow inspection, it is not surprising that his immediate
reaction was to refuse, since the relationship of the parties
was already very
tense and he was given no opportunity to consider his legal rights.  The only
remaining significance of the episode
is to show Mr Dunne's aggressive and
unreasonable attitude and state of mind at the time.  
<P>

65	On 6 November 1998 the doorman of the club put up a sign at the front desk,
past which entrants to the gym had to pass.  The
sign said `Casual visitors
living within 5Ks of this club are not allowed entry for any reason'.
Subsequently members of the gym
who were not able to produce evidence of their
club membership were refused permission to enter the building.  In a letter
dated
25 November 1998 Abbott Tout maintained that the defendant was obliged to
refuse access in this way pursuant to s 45 of the Registered
Clubs Act.
Whatever may be the precise requirements of that Act, it is striking that a
dramatic change in practice was adopted by
the defendant shortly after the
controversial extraordinary general meeting and immediately after Mr Dunne was
refused entry to inspect
the gym.  The doorman told Mr Barry that he had
instructions from the President and the board to stick to the guidelines in the
sign,
and that this had happened because Mr Barry had refused to allow Mr Dunne
to look around the gym.  The doorman said `you've obviously
pissed them off
because they also said the staff in the gym aren't allowed in the office to
photocopy or for any other reason and
that we are not allowed to give out the
phone number of the gym if anyone inquires'.  The doorman said `the board's
attitude is that
if you and Alex [the caf&eacute; owner] won't go along with
them and leave peacefully they will do whatever it takes to get you out
of here
ASAP'. 
<P>

66	It would have been open to the doorman to check the names of those who
wished to gain access the gym against the register of
members kept inside the
main entrance to the club.  Mr Barry has given evidence that nevertheless, a
number of gym members who did
not have their club membership cards were refused
admission to the club and consequently to the gym after the sign was put up.
Mr
Barry's evidence is corroborated by evidence of Linda Ormrod, the gym's
receptionist.
<P>

67	On 8 December 1998 Abbott Tout wrote to Corrs purporting to invoke the rent
review clause in the sublease, by increasing the
rent to $104,190 per annum as
from 1 November 1998.  The letter was supported by a rental valuation by DTZ
Bayleys as at 31 October
1998, supporting that figure as the gross market
rental value for the subject property.  By letter dated 17 October 1998 Corrs
wrote
to Abbott Tout asserting that the nominated rental was not a bona fide
assessment of the current market rent and enclosing a valuation
report by TJ
Davis &amp; Associates determining the current market rent as at 1 November
1998 at $42,200.  
<P>

68	A final relevant event occurred on 16 January 1999, after the commencement
of these proceedings.  When Mr Barry and Mr Pollock
arrived at the club
premises at 6.30am, they were unable to unlock the door, because the padlock
had been changed without any notice
to them.  
<P>

69	These various events generated a chain of correspondence between Abbott Tout
and Corrs, which resolved very little. 
<P>

70	Some of the incidents recounted above, if considered in isolation, would be
regarded as petty and trivial.  Others would not,
if taken in isolation, imply
any oppressive purpose.  When they are put together, however, they reveal a
systematic and concerted
course of conduct on the part of officers of the
defendant, particularly Mr Dunne.  In my opinion his objective at all times
after
his meeting with Mr Barry on 6 March 1998, but with particular intensity
after the requisition for an extraordinary general meeting
was lodged on 9
September 1998, was to make it difficult for Mr Barry to conduct his business
in the building and thereby to force
or encourage him to vacate the premises.

<P>

71	Mr Dunne was guilty of coercive and objectionable business practice, and
also of misleading conduct.  It may be that his conduct
exposes the defendant
to some form of legal liability if loss or damage can be proved to flow from
it.  But that is not the issue
which the Court must address in these
proceedings.  The question for the Court to consider is whether this misconduct
entitles the
plaintiff to the relief which it seeks, principally an order
directing the defendant to consent to the carrying out of fire safety
repair
work to satisfy Waverley Council's requirements.  It cannot be assumed that
general misbehaviour in a commercial relationship
justifies relief of that
specific kind.
<P>

	<b>The defendant's consideration of the proposals in the Howse Report</b>
<P>

72	As earlier mentioned, the Council responded to the Howse Report, accepting
the recommendations in the report subject to the consent
of the owners, in its
letter of 14 December 1998.
<P>

73	Abbott Tout indicated to the Council as early as 2 December 1998 that the
defendant regarded the Howse Report as flawed, and
objected on safety and other
grounds to the Council's decision reflected in its letter of 14 December 1998
(see Abbott Tout's letters
of 11, 18 and 24 December 1998, and 4 January
1999).
<P>

74	That correspondence indicates that the defendant consistently took the view,
after it received a copy of that Howse Report late
in November 1998 and in
particular, after the Council's letter of 14 December 1998, that it would not
consent to the works proposed
in the Howse Report.  For reasons which I shall
indicate, it may be legally relevant to determine whether the defendant behaved
reasonably
in refusing to consent to those proposed works.  
<P>

75	The principal witness for the defendant was Mr Dunne.  However, it emerged
from his oral evidence that he was away on holidays
from about 17 December to
24 January 1999, and had no involvement in any decision on behalf of the
defendant during that time.  That
was a rather crucial time, which began
shortly after the Council's letter which broadly accepted Howse Report, and
continued until
well after the present litigation had been initiated.  In those
circumstances the defendant sought leave to adduce further evidence
from
another director, Mr Tony Perry.  After hearing argument, I permitted the
additional evidence to be adduced.  
<P>

76	Mr Perry's evidence is that during the period from 15 December 1998 to 28
February 1999 he attended approximately five meetings
of the board of directors
of the defendant.  He says those meetings discussed the response which should
be taken to the Council's
letter of 14 December 1998.  He says that as a
director, he was concerned about safety issues  which may arise if the club
were to
vacate the building leaving only the gym and caf&eacute; occupied, with
respect to fire safety and other matters.
<P>

77	Other evidence of the so-called board meetings during that period suggest
that they were anything but formal meetings.  Typed,
properly formatted minutes
of meetings of the board in 1997 and 1998 were tendered in evidence.  There is
a typed minute of a monthly
board meeting held on 12 January 1999, attended by
Mr Perry, but there is no indication that the question of consent to the
proposals
in the Howse Report was discussed at that meeting.  Indeed, apart
from the cryptic note `fire report from Grubits &amp; Associates
has been
cited', the items minuted appear to be of a routine kind.  There is nothing in
the minute to indicate any discussion whatever
of the turbulent events with
respect to these proceedings which must have been of concern to board members
in January.  There are
some handwritten notes in evidence, but they do not
appear to be even rudimentary board minutes and may be nothing more than notes
of conversations or aides memoire.  
<P>

78	On balance, I doubt whether any formal board meeting was called during the
period December 1998 to February 1999 beyond the routine
monthly meetings of
the board.  However, I find that there were discussions of the events
surrounding the present litigation by members
of the board at the club.  Mr
Perry hesitated to say that he had been involved in issuing instructions to
write a particular letter.
 However, taken as a whole his evidence implies that
the directors were involved in a process of decision-making outside the formal
monthly board meetings, by which they agreed to the course of action that Mr
Mahony in fact took on the defendant's behalf.  Mr Mahony
took his principal
instructions from Mr Dunne and previously , Mr Stokes, who set the defendant on
the course which led to the decisions
of December 1998 and January 1999.  But
in my opinion the evidence of Mr Mahony and Mr Perry, taken together, leads to
the conclusion
that the directors, in their informal meetings during Mr Dunne's
absence, confirmed and approved Mr Mahony's correspondence.
<P>

79	Abbott Tout's letter to the Council of 18 December 1998 referred to the
opinion of Stastra Page ECS Pty Ltd and the interim opinion
of Stephen Grubits
&amp; Associates.  The letter concluded that if the defendant's experts'
evidence, and the advice of the Fire
Brigades when received in final form, were
to the effect that if certain works were undertaken by those wishing to remain
in the
building, it would be safe for those persons to continue in occupation,
then the defendant's consent would be granted, subject to
the decision of its
insurers.  
<P>

80	In my opinion, although it may be said that the concerns expressed in that
letter about the Council's failure to observe `due
process' were somewhat
extreme, the letter's insistence on the relevance of the forthcoming reports of
experts and the concerns about
safety and insurance reflected in the letter,
were in fact considerations influencing the directors of the defendant, and
were reasonable
considerations.  
<P>

81	Mr Mahony met with Mr Brennan of the Council on 9 February 1999, and
subsequently a meeting was arranged between Council officers
and
representatives of AJ Dean &amp; Associates and Stephen Grubits &amp;
Associates on 24 February 1999.  A summary of the meeting
by Stephen Grubits
&amp; Associates states that after considering the various experts' reports,
the club was of the opinion that
the safest option from the fire safety
perspective would be to vacate the whole of the building in accordance with the
requirements
of the Council's emergency order.  However, the club was not
opposed to the proposed partial occupation if a level of fire safety
could be
achieved that would not leave it exposed to public criticism or negligence
claims in the event of a disaster.  That is not
an unreasonable attitude.  At
the meeting of 24 February 1999 the experts agreed on modifications to the
earlier proposals in order
to provide an adequate level of fire safety should a
fire commence in the caf&eacute; or gymnasium while the upper levels of the
building were occupied by maintenance personnel.  
<P>

82	I find on the evidence as a whole that the directors of the club who were
present at the relevant times, acting with the assistance
of Mr Mahony and
experts including Mr Jones of Stephen Grubits &amp; Associates, were able to
make coherent and rational decisions
during the period of Mr Dunne's absence on
vacation, albeit decisions made in informal circumstances.  The grounds for
those decisions,
as exhibited in the letters of Abbott Tout of 18 December 1998
and 5 February 1999 and the letter of Stephen Grubits &amp; Associates
of 25
February 1999 recording the meeting with Council officers of the previous day,
imply that the defendant's decisions during
the period from mid-December to the
end of January 1999 were not unreasonable.  True it is that refusal to consent
suited their commercial
purpose of securing vacant possession by means of the
evacuation order, and that earlier conduct in which Mr Dunne participated had
been a unjustified attempt to make it difficult for the plaintiff to carry on
business and hence secure vacant possession of the
gym.  But on the evidence I
am unable to conclude that the primary or causative purposes of those directors
who, during Mr Dunne's
absence, made the decision with respect to consent, were
anything other than the purposes articulated in Abbott Tout's letters -
broadly
speaking, purposes of avoiding an increase in the fire risk and in the
defendant's potential liability.
<P>

83	The plaintiff submitted that a decision by the defendant to permit a party
to be held on the club's premises on 30 January 1999
showed that the defendant
was not really concerned about fire safety in spite of its protestations.
Whether that decision was or
was not a wise one, I do not regard it as
undermining my conclusion as to the defendant's primary purpose in refusing its
consent.
 Allowing the party was a very limited and temporary risk at a time
when the club was still in occupation of the building and therefore
in a
position to exercise a degree of control over its use.
<P>

	<b>The plaintiff's contentions</b>
<P>

84	In all these circumstances, the question is whether the plaintiff is
entitled to the principal relief which it seeks, namely
an order that the
defendant provide its consent to Waverley Council for the plaintiff to carry
out such fire safety works as Waverley
Council may require as a condition of
permitting the plaintiff to remain in occupation of the premises.
<P>

85	The plaintiff puts its case broadly in two ways.  First, the plaintiff says
that the defendant as landlord is obliged under the
terms of the sublease to
carry out the repairs, and the defendant having failed to do so within a
reasonable time, the plaintiff
is entitled at its option to do the requisite
repairs itself.  This contention has two limbs:  that the defendant is under
the requisite
obligation to do the work, and that as the defendant has failed
to carry out its duty the plaintiff is entitled to do the work itself.
 The
plaintiff's submissions have concentrated principally on the first limb of this
contention, by seeking to identify the sources
of the defendant's alleged
obligation.  The plaintiff says that there are four sources of the obligation,
namely:
<P>

	(a) clause 15.1 of the Headlease, made applicable by clause 13.1 of the
Sublease;
<P>

	(b) clause 5.1 of the Headlease, made applicable by clause 13.1 of the
Sublease;
<P>

	(c) the express covenant to give quiet enjoyment contained in clause 8.1 of
the Sublease;
<P>

	(d) the implied covenant not to derogate from the grant.
<P>

86	The plaintiff's second contention is that if, contrary to its first
contention, the Court finds that neither the plaintiff nor
the defendant is
required to do the fire upgrade work, then the Court should nevertheless find
that the defendant as landlord is
obliged to co-operate and permit the
plaintiff as tenant to effect the work at its option and expense;  or at least
the landlord
is obliged not to refuse to co-operate unreasonably or for
extraneous purposes such as to achieve early vacant possession.  The plaintiff
seeks to derive the implied obligation to co-operate (or not to refuse to
co-operate unreasonably or for improper purposes) from
the covenant for quiet
enjoyment, the implied term not to derogate from the grant, and implied terms
of the kind referred to in the
<i>MacKay v Dick</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281881%29%206%20AC%20251" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1881) 6 App Cas 251</a>, 263.
The notion that there is contractual duty of good faith or fair dealing is also
relevant to this contention.  
<P>

87	The defendant denies that there is any express or implied contractual
obligation which would require it to carry out any work
in response to such
statutory requirements as arise with respect to fire safety under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979</a> (NSW).  Further, the defendant
says that if there is any relevant contractual obligation, it cannot be
unqualified and must be in
a form which gives the defendant a discretion
whether or not to consent, provided it acts reasonably, and in this case it has
done
so  Finally, the defendant says that even if there is an obligation with
which it has not complied, the only appropriate remedy for
the defendant is
damages, and there is no basis for an order directing the defendant to consent
to the carrying out of works.  
<P>

88	Before dealing with these various contentions, I wish to make some
observations about the relevant law at a more general level.
 
<P>

	<b>The landlord's duties under property and contract law</b>
<P>

89	Part of the plaintiff's argument is that there are express provisions of the
Sublease, importing provisions of the Headlease,
which impose relevant
obligations on the defendant.  The assessment of that part of the plaintiff's
contentions depends on construction
of the Sublease in accordance with
established cannons of construction.  Additionally however, the plaintiff seeks
to rely on various
implied terms.  That part of the plaintiff's contentions
brings into application some parts of the law which are in a relatively
fluid
state.
<P>

90	Traditionally the law of landlord and tenant was reasonably clear, and also
quite restrictive, on the question of implied covenants
by the landlord.  The
courts held that there was no implied covenant by the landlord that the demised
premises were fit for any particular
purpose.  This was so even if the lease
contemplated use of the demised premises for a particular purpose, and
contained a covenant
by the tenant not to use the demised premises for any
purpose other than the stated one:  <i>Hill v Harris</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%202%20QB%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965] 2 QB 601.</a>  In
that case the tenant as sub-lessee covenanted to use the demised premises only
for the purposes of a retail tobacco and confectionery
shop, but that use was
inconsistent with a provision in the head-lease;  it was held that the landlord
was not liable for breach
of any implied covenant.  Similarly in <i>Sutton v
Temple</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1843/1101.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1843] EngR 1101</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281843%29%2012%20M%20%26%20W%2052" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1843) 12 M&amp;W 52</a>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=152%20ER%201108" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">152 ER 1108</a>, the tenant of pasture land whose
cattle died because of paint which had been spread with manure before the
commencement of the tenancy,
failed to establish breach of covenant by the
landlord.  In <i>Hart v Windsor</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1843/31.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1843] EngR 31</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281843%29%2012%20M%20%26%20W%2068" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1843) 12 M&amp;W 68</a>,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=152%20ER%201114" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">152 ER 1114</a> the
tenant of an unfurnished house infested with bugs failed to establish breach of
an implied covenant of fitness by the landlord.
 Those cases were accepted as
correct in <i>Wettern Electric Ltd v Walsh Development Agency </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%202%20All%20ER%20629" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 2 All
ER 629</a>, but they were held to be inapplicable on the facts, which concerned a
licensor and licensee, and the court implied a term as to
fitness by the
application of standard principles for the implication of contractual terms.

<P>

91	The law's refusal to imply a covenant as to fitness went so far that there
was not even an implied covenant by the landlord of
residential premises that
the demised premises would continue to be fit for habitation throughout the
term of the lease.  In <i>Sarson v Roberts </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1895%5d%202%20QB%20395" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1895] 2 QB 395</a> the tenant
failed to recover damages from the landlord when his family contracted scarlet
fever from other occupants of the house
which contained the demised premises.
The Court of Appeal specifically rejected a submission that there was an
implied covenant that
the premises would continue to be fit for occupation
during the term of the lease.  It appears that the courts' refusal to imply
a
term as to fitness in leases was maintained even where the landlord was aware,
when the lease was entered into, that the tenant
was entering into the lease
for the exclusive purpose of using the demised premises in a particular way:
<i>Bradford House Pty Ltd v Leroy Fashion Group Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%2046%20ALR%20305" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 46 ALR 305.</a>  
<P>

92	As Waddell J said in <i>Brilee Consultants Pty Ltd v Tibal Holdings Pty Ltd
</i>(1984) 3 BPR [97184] at 9274, it is arguable that the law should impose on
landlords an obligation to keep the demised premises fit
for occupation during
any lease which is for a substantial term.  But the law of landlord and tenant
does not do so.  Waddell J specifically
rejected the contention that the lessor
in that case was under an implied obligation to comply with so much of a fire
safety order
issued by the relevant council as would be necessary to avoid
closure of the premises.  
<P>

93	However, it must be recognised that a commercial lease is not merely a
demise of a proprietary interest in land.  Typically the
lease, or the
agreement for lease which it reflects, records as a matter of contract the
overall commercial relationship between
the parties, not merely their
proprietary relationship as landlord and tenant.  As a matter of contract, the
agreement of the parties
may modify or override the bare principles of the law
of landlord and tenant.  Thus, if the lease contains a promise by the tenant
that it will use the demised premises in a particular way, which necessarily
involves the use of heavy machinery (for example, a
promise that the premises
be used as a printery in which rolls of paper must be moved by fork lift), the
lease may well contain an
implied warranty that the floor of the premises is
sufficiently strong to permit the normal conduct of the business and the use of
heavy machinery for that purpose.  Here the commercial arrangement between the
parties goes beyond a mere covenant by the tenant
not to use the premises other
than for the stated use.  These principles were accepted by Smithers J in the
<i>Bradford House </i>case (at 314), though in that case the implication of
such a term was excluded because of an express provision dealing with the use
of heavy machinery.  A similar implied term was read into a commercial licence
in the <i>Wettern Electric </i>case.  
<P>

94	Therefore as I understand the law, it is permissible and necessary for the
Court, where the parties to a lease are in a commercial
contractual
relationship such as they are in the present case, to consider whether any
implied term arises under the principles applicable
to commercial contracts,
rather than limiting its attention to the implied covenants recognised by the
law of landlord and tenant.
 Thus, it is correct for the plaintiff to submit
that the Court should have regard not only to the implied term not to derogate
from
the grant, but also to implied contractual terms such as the one referred
to in <i>MacKay v Dick</i>.
<P>

95	The general principles governing the implication of contractual terms have
been addressed by the High Court and the Privy Council
in some well-known
cases:  <i>BP Refinery (Western Port) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings </i>(1997)
180 CLR 266, esp at 283;  <i>Hawkins v Clayton</i> (1988) 164 CLR 539, 573;

CLR 410.</a>  Criteria for ascertaining the presumed intention of the parties were
stated by the Privy Council in the <i>BP Refinery</i> case (at 283) in a
frequently cited passage:
<P>

	`(1) [the implication] must be reasonable and equitable;  (2) it must be
necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, so
that no term will be
implied if the contract is effective without it;  (3) it must be so obvious
that `it goes without saying'; 
(4) it must be capable of clear expression;
(5) it must not contradict any express term of the contract.'
<P>

96	One kind of term which may be implied by following this approach is the one
described in the <i>MacKay v Dick</i> (at 263) in the following way:
<P>

	`As a general rule ... where in a written contract it appears that both
parties have agreed that something shall be done, which
cannot effectually be
done unless both concur in doing it, the construction of the contract is that
each agrees to do all that is
necessary to be done on his part for the carrying
out of that thing, though there may be no express words to that effect.'
<P>

97	Recently substantial academic attention has been given to the content of
implied terms, and in particular, to the question whether
the kinds of terms
which are implied to give business efficacy to contracts might be unified and
broadened into an implied term of
good faith or reasonableness in the
performance of obligations and the exercise of rights.  The idea that there is
a contractual
doctrine of good faith emerging in Australian law was explored by
Priestley JA in <i>Renard Constructions (ME) Pty Ltd v Minister for Public
Works </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2026%20NSWLR%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 26 NSWLR 234.</a>  In that case the question was whether a
contractual power in a building contract which permitted the principal to take
over the
builder's work was required to be exercised reasonably.  In Priestley
JA's view the requirement of reasonableness was an implication
in fact as to
the actual intention of the parties to the contract having regard to the
surrounding circumstances.  His Honour said
that `reasonableness in
performance' in the exercise of a contractual power of this kind had much in
common with the notions of good
faith which are regarded in many civil law
systems of Europe and in all States of the United States as necessarily implied
in many
kinds of contract.  He remarked that although this implication has not
yet been accepted to the same extent in Australia, as part
of judge-made
Australian contract law, there are many indications that the time may be fast
approaching when the idea will gain explicit
recognition in the same way as it
has in Europe and the United States.  Handley JA (at 279-280) said that he
agreed generally with
`much of what Priestley JA has written'.  <i>Renard
Constructions</i> was applied by Kirby P and Priestley JA in <i>Hughes Bros Pty
Ltd v Trustees of Roman Catholic Church (Archdiocese of Sydney) </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2031%20NSWLR%2091" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 31
NSWLR 91.</a>
<P>

98	Priestley JA's remarks were taken up by Finn J in <i>Hughes Aircraft Systems
International v Airservices Australia </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1997/558.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] FCA 558</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20146%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 146 ALR 1</a>, 36ff.  After
analysing the law, Finn J expressed the opinion (at 37) that `fair dealing' is
a major (if not openly articulated)
organising idea in Australian law.  He said
that the implied duty of good faith is an accepted idea in the contract law of
the United
States and probably of Canada, and that its more open recognition in
our contract law is now warranted.  He referred to Sir Anthony
Mason's lecture,
`Contract and its Relationship with Equitable Standards and the Doctrine of
Good Faith' (The Cambridge Lectures,
1993 (8 July 1993)).

99	In <i>Alcatel Australia Ltd v Scarcella</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/483.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 483</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 44 NSWLR 349</a> Sheller JA
(with whom Powell and Beazley JJA agreed) reviewed these and other cases and
said (at 369):
<P>

	`The decisions in <i>Renard Constructions</i> and <i>Hughes Bros </i> mean
that in New South Wales a duty of good faith, both in performing obligations
and exercising rights, may by implication be imposed
upon parties as part of a
contract.'
<P>

100	In that case a landlord had commissioned a report from a fire engineer, who
reported that works were needed for fire safety
reasons.  At the landlord's
invitation, the local council inspected the premises and found that they did
not comply with fire safety
requirements.  The council specified particular
work which it required to be carried out.  Under the lease the tenant was
obliged
to observe and perform all lawful requirements pursuant to State
legislation.  The tenant purported to challenge the council's determination
but
the landlord declined to permit the tenant to proceed in its name as owner.  It
was contended that the lease contained an implied
term that the landlord would
co-operate with the tenant so as to facilitate the bringing of appeal
proceedings in the landlord's
name to test whether the council's order was
lawful.  As Windeyer J remarked at first instance (at 361), that was really a
claim
for an implication of a term of fair dealing.  Sheller JA said that there
was no reason why a duty of good faith should not be implied
as part of the
lease.  He held, however, that the landlord was not acting unconscionably or in
breach of an implied term of good
faith in the circumstances of that case,
where the landlord merely took steps to ensure that the requirements for fire
safety contained
in its expert's report should be put in place.
<P>

101	In the present case, therefore, I must consider not only whether the
defendant as landlord is subject to an implied obligation
arising out of the
express covenants of the lease (including the covenant for quiet enjoyment),
and whether its implied obligation
not to derogate from its grant is applicable
to the present circumstances.  I must also consider whether, having regard to
the principles
enunciated in the <i>BP Refinery </i>case, the landlord is
subject to an implied term of the kind described in <i>MacKay v Dick</i> or
more broadly, an implied duty of good faith which may be relevant to the
plaintiff's claim for relief.  
<P>

	<b>Clause 15.1 of the Headlease and clause 13.1 of the Sublease</b>
<P>

102	The plaintiff's contention is that clause 15.1 imposed an obligation on the
defendant in favour of the plaintiff, because it
was imported into the Sublease
by clause 13.1.  A covenant in a sub-lease by the sub-lessor to `observe' the
obligations in the head-lease
is effective to permit the sub-lessee to require
the sub-lessor to perform obligations (such as an obligation to repair the
exterior
of the premises demised by the sub-lease) imposed on the sub-lessor by
the head-lease:  <i>Ayling v Wade </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1961%5d%202%20QB%20228" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1961] 2 QB 228.</a>
<P>

103	However a general provision such as clause 13.1 must be construed in light
of the other provisions of the Sublease in the circumstances
which existed at
the time of entry into that instrument.  The Sublease was dated 29 September
1995, although the term commenced on
1 November 1994.  By the latter date the
Council's requirements under the notice of 29 August 1991 had been outstanding
for over
three years.  Over four years had passed by the time of execution of
the Sublease, and on 13 January 1995 the Council had served
a new and different
notice on the defendant.  In my opinion clause 13.1 of the Sublease cannot be
construed to mean that the defendant
thereby undertook, in effect, to
resuscitate the 1991 notice and comply with it for the benefit of the
plaintiff, so many years after
it had been issued.  The covenant in clause 15.1
to comply with the Council's notice was an obligation which the plaintiff
undertook
to perform within six calendar months of the date of the headlease,
namely 23 October 1991.  I construe the covenant to provide a
certificate under
s 317AE of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lga1993182/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Government Act</a> to the headlessor within six months as
ancillary to and consequential upon performance of the covenant to comply with
the notice,
not identifying a separate and independent obligation.  The
obligation created by clause 15.1, limited in time as it was, did not
endure to
create a right to performance in the plaintiff when the Sublease commenced, nor
when the Sublease instrument was executed.
 Clause 13.1 must be taken to be
subject to an implied qualification that the defendant's undertaking to observe
the Headlease applies
only as far as the provisions of the Headlease remained
applicable at the time when that promise took effect.  So construed, clause
13.1 does not enable the plaintiff to enforce clause 15.1 of the Headlease
against the defendant in this case.
<P>

104	It is not necessary for me to consider whether, if clause 15.1 had
indirectly applied through clause 13.1, it would entitle
the plaintiff to
assert a right to carry out the works in the Howse Report to satisfy the rather
different requirements which the
Council asserted some seven years after the
1991 notice was issued.  My view, however, is that the Council's 1998
requirements are
so different from its 1991 requirements, in the manner
explained in the affidavit of Mr Jones sworn on 4 March 1999, that one cannot
move from non-compliance with the 1991 notice to any relevant conclusion about
the obligations of the defendant to the plaintiff
in 1998 and 1999.  The mere
fact (if it were established) that the 1998 requirements may not have been
imposed by Council if the
1991 notice had been complied with, would not of
itself be sufficient for me to conclude that clause 15.1 imports an obligation
to
comply with the Council's 1998 and 1999 requirements; and in any case, my
view is that this fact has not been established, given
the differences between
the 1991 and 1998 requirements as explained in Mr Jones' affidavit.  
<P>

	<b>Clause 5.1 of the headlease and clause 13.1 of the sublease</b>
<P>

105	The plaintiff submits that the work necessary to meet Council's fire safety
requirements falls within clause 5.1 of the Headlease,
which the defendant is
bound to the plaintiff to observe having regard to clause 13.1 of the Sublease.
The work in question, recommended
by the Howse Report and referred to in
Council's letter to Verekers dated 14 December 1998, is partly work on the
premises occupied
by the defendant, and partly work to the premises occupied by
the building's tenants.
<P>

106	The defendant's covenant to observe and perform its obligations under the
Headlease must be construed together with the other
relevant provisions of the
Sublease.  They include clause 5.1 of the Sublease, by which the plaintiff
covenants as tenant to keep
the demised premises in good and substantial
repair, order and condition having regard to their condition at the date of
commencement
of the term.  In my opinion, clause 13.1 must be read subject to
the more specific provision of clause 5.1 of the Sublease.  Therefore
to the
extent that some of the required work is properly described as repairs to the
demised premises, it is the responsibility of
the plaintiff under the Sublease,
subject only to the limiting proviso to clause 5.1 which refers to the
condition of the premises
at the commencement of the term.  
<P>

107	The plaintiff says that clause 5.1 of the Headlease applies, via clause
13.1, and that the work required by the Council's letter
of 14 December 1998
and the Howse Report does not involve `structural maintenance, replacement or
repair' for which the defendant
is generally not liable under clause 5.1.  If
this submission is correct, the obligation may be qualified by clause 5.1 of
the Sublease,
to the extent that the works relate to the demised premises.
<P>

108	In deciding whether the works in the Howse Report are properly described as
structural works, I must have regard to the principles
enunciated in such cases
as <i>Grenada Theatres Ltd v Freehold Investments (Leytonstone) Ltd </i><a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1959/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1959] EWCA Civ 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1959%5d%202%20All%20ER%20176" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1959]
2 All ER 176.</a>  The distinction between structural and non-structural repairs
requires the Court to make a practical judgment as to whether the
work, having
regard to its nature and extent, interferes with or alters the framework or
structure of the building.  Older case law,
referred to by Jenkins LJ in that
case at page 181, tended to describe all non-structural work as `decorative',
but the modern connotation
of that word may be too limited to allow it any
continuing utility.  Having particular regard to their extent, my opinion is
that
works in the Howse Report include a structural element, particularly as
they involve construction of walls and similar sealing structures,
and fire
doors:  see especially the Howse Report, paragraphs 6.2.1(i), (ii), (iv), (vi);
6.2.2(ii), (iii), (iv);  6.2.3(i), (ii),
(iii), (viii), (ix).  I note the
evidence that Mr Dwyer, in his affidavit of 8 March 1999, that in his opinion
the works do not involve
structural maintenance, replacement or repair but are
merely `fire safety upgrading works'.  I have given consideration to Mr Dwyer's
opinion but it does not deflect me from my conclusion.  While an expert's
opinion on the facts relevant to the Court's construction
of a repair clause
may be of assistance, I cannot allow an expert's opinion to replace the Court's
own conclusion as to the proper
classification of the building work as
structural or non-structural repairs, especially when the factual basis for the
opinion and
the expert's understanding of the meaning of the terms are not
articulated.
<P>

109	One consequence of my conclusion is that the plaintiff has no obligation
under the Sublease to carry out the fire safety work
to the extent that the
work is structural.  Another is that the defendant has no such obligation under
clause 5.1 of the Headlease
and clause 13.1 of the Sublease, except to the
extent that the work is rendered necessary by an act, neglect, default or
omission
by the defendant.  The plaintiff says that there is such a default or
omission, namely the defendant's failure to comply with clause
15.1 by failing
to carry out the Council's 1991 requirements.  The difficulty with that
submission is the absence of any convincing
evidence to link the Howse
requirements to the 1991 Council notice.  In the absence of that evidence (and
in view of the evidence
given by Mr Jones in his affidavit of 4 March 1999), I
am unable to conclude that the work recommended in the Howse Report (or for
that matter, any of the work referred to in the Council's notice of 7 September
1998) has been `rendered necessary' by the default
or omission of the defendant
when it failed to comply with the Council's 1991 notice.
<P>

110	It seems to me that, if one accepts that of the work recommended by the
Howse Report is necessary to keep the building in good
and substantial repair,
then that part of the work which relates to non-structural repairs to the
building outside the demised premises
(that is, other than work in the gym) is
work which the defendant is responsible to carry out under clause 5.1 of the
Headlease and
clause 13.1 of the Sublease.  But that is rather less than the
whole of the works, and is insufficient to give the plaintiff an entitlement
to
the relief which it seeks.  
<P>

	<b>Covenant for quiet enjoyment - Sublease clause 8.1</b>
<P>

111	A breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment occurs whenever the landlord
causes substantial interference with the enjoyment
of the demised premises
through an act or omission that is either deliberate or negligent in the sense
that its consequences were
reasonably foreseeable:  <i>Martin's Camera Corner
Pty Ltd v Hotel Mayfair Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%202%20NSWLR%2015" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] 2 NSWLR 15</a>;  <i>Kohua Pty Ltd v Tai Ping
Trading Pty Ltd </i>(1985) 3 BPR [97,240];  P Butt<i>, Land Law </i>(3rd ed
1996), p305-308.  In <i>Reid House Pty Ltd v Beneke</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%205%20ACLC%20451" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 5 ACLC 451</a> it
was recognised that the execution of fire safety works could amount to a breach
of the covenant for quiet enjoyment, since in
that case the work involved
depriving the tenant of space by the construction of corridors.  This was so
even though the work was
done in compliance with the Council's requirements.
But the question in the present case is a different one.  Here the question is
not whether performance of the fire safety works will interfere with the
tenant's quiet possession, but whether the landlord is obliged
by that covenant
to permit the works to be carried out.  
<P>

112	Further, the breach of the covenant in that case was the performance of the
works.  Here the plaintiff says that the breach
arose through the landlord
failing to expend money for eight years on fire safety, bringing with it the
reasonably foreseeable consequence
of upsetting the quiet enjoyment of the
demised premises by the plaintiff.  In my opinion the evidence does not
establish a breach
by the defendant of the covenant for quiet enjoyment after
the grant of the Sublease.  The interference with the plaintiff's quiet
enjoyment of the demised premises arises from the act of the Council in issuing
the emergency order, and is not an `interruption
or disturbance from the
[defendant] or any other person lawfully claiming by from or under the
[defendant]'.  It may well be that
the defendant's failure to make fire repairs
prior to and after the commencement of the Sublease led to the Council's
action;  or
at least, that if the defendant had made proper expenditure the
Council would not have acted.  But the defendant's conduct or omission
has not
itself interrupted or disturbed the plaintiff's peaceful possession and
enjoyment of the demised premises.  The Council's
decision was its own decision
taken in the exercise of its statutory discretion.
<P>

	<b>The defendant's implied covenant not to derogate from its grant</b>
<P>

113	Professor Butt (<i>Land Law</i>, 3rd ed 1996) at paragraph 1553 has
explained the law on this subject as follows:
<P>

	`Where the landlord remains in possession or control of premises which are
ancillary to the leased premises (such as a roof, stairway
or drains), and
keeping the ancillary premises in repair is necessary for the proper enjoyment
of the leased premises, then the landlord
must take reasonable care to ensure
that the ancillary premises are kept in repair, or at least that they are not
in a condition
that causes damage to the defendant or to the leased premises.'

<P>

114	These principles have been applied in such well-known cases as <i>Alden v
Latimer Clark Muirhead &amp; Co </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1894%5d%202%20Ch%20437" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1894] 2 Ch 437</a> and <i>Browne v Fowler
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1911%5d%201%20Ch%20219" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1911] 1 Ch 219.</a>  The principles were recently considered and applied by
the Queensland Court of Appeal in <i>Aussie Traveller Pty Ltd v Marklea Pty Ltd
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%201%20Qd%20R%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 1 QldR 1.</a>
<P>

115	The plaintiff says that the landlord's obligation to keep the ancillary
premises in repair must include an obligation to make
necessary repairs or
upgrades to prevent the building being condemned.  The plaintiff says there is
no difference in principle between
allowing the premises to fall into such
disrepair with respect to stairs, drains or the roof that their disrepair
interferes directly
with the tenant, and letting matters reach the point where
the Council interferes;  <i>a fortiori</i> where such a consequence was
reasonably foreseeable at the time of the grant of the lease.  
<P>

116	To the extent that this submission relies on the implied covenant not to
derogate from the grant, as opposed to a broader implied
contractual term, my
opinion is that it fails, for effectively the same reasons as were given in
analogous circumstances by Waddell
J in the <i>Brilee Consultants</i> case.
Considering a submission that there was an implied term in a commercial lease
which would oblige the landlord to comply with
fire safety requirements,
Waddell J said (at 9274):
<P>

	`However, the implied obligations the general law does impose on lessors in
relation to the condition of premises are very limited
indeed.  An account of
them is to be found in Woodfall, <i>Landlord &amp; Tenant </i>28th ed) p 618
ff.  Nothing is to be found in that account which would support the terms
sought to be implied in the present case.
 Indeed it is clear that in cases
such as the present, there is only a limited implied obligation on a lessor to
keep demised premises
in repair.  What the plaintiff seeks to establish in the
present case is, of course, an implied term which goes further, namely,
one
which obliges the lessor to alter and add to the premises so as to comply with
statutory requirements as to fire precautions.
 
<P>

	These considerations are, in my opinion, sufficient to reject the notion that
any of the implied terms put forward for the plaintiff
should be implied as a
legal incident of a lease for a substantial term of business premises in
reliance upon principles of the kind
applied in [<i>Liverpool City Council v
Irwin </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%20AC%20239" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1971] AC 239].'</a>
<P>

117	This is not a case where the interference with the plaintiff's quiet
enjoyment comes from another tenant whose conduct the defendant
as landlord is
able to correct or terminate, as in the <i>Aussie Traveller</i> case.  Here the
interference comes from the order of the Council.  
<P>

	<b>Implied contractual terms </b>
<P>

118	The plaintiff submits that since the fire repair work is required to permit
it to continue to occupy the demised premises, the
defendant is at least
obliged either:
<P>

	* to co-operate and permit the plaintiff to effect such work at its option and
expense;  or
<P>

	* not to refuse to co-operate unreasonably or for an extraneous purpose.
<P>

119	To the extent that such an obligation does not flow from the covenant for
quiet enjoyment and the implied covenant not to derogate
from the grant, the
plaintiff says that the obligation arises from an implied term.  The implied
term may be of the kind referred
to in <i>MacKay v Dick</i>, or may be an
implied obligation to exercise contractual power reasonably and in good faith.

<P>

120	The plaintiff's contention is that the parties agreed that the plaintiff
would have quiet enjoyment of the demised premises
as lessee.  That agreement
implies that the plaintiff's possession will be protected against interference
by the co-operative efforts
of the parties, and therefore that the parties will
co-operate to remove the threat to the plaintiff's quiet enjoyment which is
constituted
by the Council's emergency order.  
<P>

121	In my opinion this attempt to imply a term on the authority of <i>MacKay v
Dick</i> fails, because compliance with the Council's fire safety requirements
cannot be classed as something the parties have agreed `shall
be done'.  Nor
can it be said that the parties have agreed that the plaintiff's quiet
possession will be preserved to such a degree
that they must comply with the
requirements of a statutory authority, whatever may be the content of those
requirements or the cost
of meeting them.  The express terms of the Sublease
deal with the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to repairs and
compliance with the requirements of statutory authorities.  Therefore there is
no room here for the operation of <i>MacKay v Dick</i>.
<P>

122	Nor, in my opinion, is there any room for the application of any obligation
of fair dealing, good faith or reasonableness. 
Accepting for the sake of
analysis that the parties in this case are subject to a contractual duty of
good faith, I do not regard
the defendant's conduct, in its commercial context,
as inconsistent with such a duty.  I have found that the defendant through its
President and other officers, engaged in conduct designed to make it difficult
for the plaintiff to carry on business in the demised
premises, with a view to
securing vacant possession of the building.  But I have also found that the
defendant's conduct in provisionally
declining to consent to the works proposed
in the Council's letter of 14 December 1998 was not unreasonable.  To adapt the
words
of Sheller JA in the <i>Alcatel Australia</i> case, expressed in a
broadly analogous factual context (at 369):
<P>

	`In a commercial context it cannot be said, in my opinion, that a property
owner acts unconscionably or in breach of an implied
term of good faith in a
lease of the property by taking steps to ensure that the requirements for fire
safety advised by an expert
fire engineer should be put in place'.
<P>

123	This, in effect, is what the plaintiff did in obtaining and seeking to rely
upon the Second Dean Report and the reports by Stephen
Grubits &amp;
Associates, and, through Mr Mahony, encouraging those experts to have their
meeting with officers of the Council on
24 February 1999.  Any inclination I
might have to contribute to the emerging law on the contractual duty of good
faith is thwarted
by this lack of factual substratum.
<P>

	<b>Plaintiff's entitlement to specific relief</b>
<P>

124	I conclude, therefore, that the defendant had no duty to consent to the
carrying out of fire repair works to meet the Council's
requirements, though it
may have a duty arising out of clause 5.1 of the Headlease to make some
non-structural repairs to the building,
other than the demised premises, to the
extent that such work was necessary to keep the building in good and
substantial repair,
order and condition.
<P>

125	In view of my conclusions as to the defendant's obligations under the law
of landlord and tenant and the law of contract, it
is not necessary for me to
decide whether there would be a proper basis for a mandatory order of the kind
sought by the plaintiff,
if the requisite duty had been established.  But I
note that the form of the relief sought by the plaintiff presents a difficulty.
It would obviously be unacceptable for the Court to order the defendant to give
its consent for work to be carried out on its own
premises, without giving the
defendant a means of objecting to the scope or quality of the work.  As soon as
the Court's orders are
qualified by allowing for such recourse, one comes up
against the longstanding reluctance of courts to make orders which might lead
to constant supervision of the performance of the contract - an especially
strong reluctance in the case of a contract which involves
building work.  
<P>

	<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

126	In the result the plaintiff's summons fails so far as it seeks an order
that the defendant consent to the fire safety works
required by Waverley
Council (paragraph 6 in the Summons).
<P>

127	The plaintiff's counsel indicated that the plaintiff seeks orders in
accordance with paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 of the Summons as
well as paragraph 6.  I
understand that the plaintiff does not now seek orders for damages and interest
(paragraphs 8 and 9 respectively).
 Paragraphs 3 and 5 relate to whether the
plaintiff has effectively exercised its option to extend the Sublease for a
further three
year term from 1 November 1998, and paragraph 2 relates to
whether the defendant has given the plaintiff an effective notice to quit
the
demised premises.  As I understand counsels' submissions, there is now no
dispute about these matters.  If that is so, there
may be no good reason to
make any of the orders, except by consent.  However, I will hear submissions as
to whether there is any
good reason for making orders 2, 3 and 5, though I note
that the reason will have to be particularly convincing in the case of order
5,
which is an order in the nature of specific performance rather than a
declaratory order.  I shall also hear the submissions of
the parties on the
question of costs.
<P>

128	It may initially seem to be unfair that the plaintiff's case fails, even
though I have found officers of the defendant to be
guilty of improper
commercial conduct.  But fairness does not require that in all the
circumstances of this case, such misconduct
should entitle the plaintiff to
compel the defendant to consent to substantial work which it does not wish to
have done to the building
which it owns - nor, in my opinion, does the law.
