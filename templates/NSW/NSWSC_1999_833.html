Anor</u></b>
<P>


<P>

<b>Reasons for judgment</b>
<P>

1    	HIS HONOUR:  In the evening of 7 August 1996 police
executed a search warrant at a home in Waterloo occupied by the plaintiff,
Susan Margaret Vincent, her husband, Colin Vincent and their two children.  The
first defendant is the justice who issued the warrant
and the second defendant,
Senior Constable Steven Campbell, is the police officer who applied for it and
who, with other police,
executed it.  By summons in this Court, the plaintiff
seeks a declaration that the warrant was invalid and an order that it be set
aside.
<P>

2    	I received evidence, both by way of affidavit and
orally, about the circumstances giving rise to the issue of the warrant
and the
events of the evening in which the search was carried out.  The plaintiff's
solicitor objected to evidence about the search,
on the basis that it was
irrelevant to the validity of the issue of thewarrant.  I allowed the evidence,
stating that I would determine
its relevance in the light of final submissions
about the merits of the matter.
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

3    	On 3 August 1996 Mr and Mrs Vincent's fourteen year
old daughter, Keira, attended Redfern police station, where Snr Cnst Campbell
was on duty.  There was conflict in the evidence about how she came to be at
the police station, but I do not find it necessary to
resolve it.  She told Snr
Cnst Campbell that her parents had been selling cannabis from the home at
Waterloo for some time.  She
said that each morning they obtained the cannabis
from a woman, whom she knew only as Taina, at a block of flats in
Brighton-Le-Sands.
 She also claimed that her parents were receiving stolen
property.
<P>

4    	Snr Cnst Campbell located a building at
Brighton-Le-Sands which answered the description provided by Keira, and
enquiries
revealed that one of the flats was occupied by a woman whose
Christian name was Taina.  He also obtained police intelligence reports
relating to Mr and Mrs Vincent, which led him to the view that they were
engaged in the supply of cannabis and, indeed, heroin. 
These were reports of
information received between 5 March and 11 July 1996 to the effect that they
were dealing in drugs, mainly
cannabis.  For the most part, the source of the
information appears to have been unnamed members of the public and two of the
reports
suggest that Keira herself was involved.  None of the reports was the
result of police surveillance.
<P>

5    	On 7 August, the day of the search, Snr Cnst Campbell
attended Redfern Local Court and sought the issue of a warrant by the
first
defendant, an authorised justice within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/swa1985175/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s3</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/swa1985175/" class="autolink_findacts">Search
Warrants Act</i> 1985</a>.  He presented a typed application for the warrant, which
asserted that information had been received from "a reliable source" that
Mr
and Mrs Vincent were "actively engaged in the supply of cannabis and other
drugs and receiving stolen property". The source was
said to be a "young
informant", a member of the family living at the subject premises, who had
witnessed Mr and Mrs Vincent "buying
and selling the prohibited drugs for a
lengthy period of time".  It went on to summarise Keira's account of her
parents' obtaining
drugs from Brighton-Le-Sands and returning to the home,
where they were "packaged and sold".  Finally, it asserted that both Mr and
Mrs
Vincent were known to police "through their association with drugs", there
being "several intelligence reports from other informants
and police in
relation to selling drugs". 
<P>

6    	Snr Cnst Campbell did not show the justice any of the
intelligence reports which he had obtained.  In response to a question
from the
justice, he said that both Mr and Mrs Vincent had recorded convictions for
possessing cannabis.  As he acknowledged in evidence
before me, this was not
true of either of them.  In oral evidence, he said that he had gained that
mistaken impression from the material
about Mr and Mrs Vincent which he had
read four days earlier, after he was approached by their daughter.
<P>

7    	The justice issued the warrant, setting out in
writing his reasons for doing so in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/swa1985175/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">s13(1)</a> of the Act.  Those
reasons referred to the information in the typewritten application for the
warrant, together with "further information
received orally and on oath in
respect of informant and informant's information".  There was no evidence
before me of what that further
information was.  They also included the
erroneous belief that Mr and Mrs Vincent had convictions for possessing
cannabis.
<P>

8    	As earlier observed, the search took place that
evening.  The plaintiff was present but her husband was not, although he
arrived
home before the police had left.  From outside the premises Sgt Janne
McMahon saw a man throw a quantity of self-sealing plastic
bags and a set of
scales from the first floor balcony.  It was not Mr Vincent, who was not in the
house at the time.  There were
two other men in the house, but Sgt McMahon was
unable to identify either of them as the man she had seen.  
<P>

9    	Police located a number of small plastic satchels of
cannabis in a box in Mr and Mrs Vincent's bedroom.  The plaintiff denied
any
knowledge of it.  There was some dispute in the evidence as to what Mr Vincent
said about it when he arrived but, again, I do
need to resolve it.  Either he
denied knowledge of it or, at least, made no admission about it.  The plaintiff
accompanied police
to Redfern police station, where she declined to be
interviewed.  A subsequent examination of the satchels at the fingerprint
section
failed to detect any fingerprints on them.  In the event, no one was
charged. 
<P>

10    	In evidence before me, both Mr and Mrs Vincent
denied the allegations their daughter had made about them.  They said that
she
had run away from home at that time, apparently resentful of the discipline
which they had imposed upon her.  Since then she
had returned to live at home,
and Mr Vincent said that her behaviour had improved.  There was no evidence
from her in this Court.

<P>

<b>Validity of the warrant</b>
<P>

11    	By <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/swa1985175/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s6</a> of the Act a justice may issue a search
warrant if he or she is "satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for doing
so...".  The
requirement of reasonable grounds is common to search warrants
legislation throughout the country and it has been considered in a
number of
decisions, both at first instance and on appeal.  In <i>George v Rockett</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20170%20CLR%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 170 CLR 104</a> the High Court was called upon to consider a provision in
the Queensland Criminal Code.  In a joint judgment, the Court described
the
policy governing such a provision in this way (at 110-11):
<P>

In prescribing conditions governing the issue of search warrants, the
legislature has sought to balance the need for an effective
criminal justice
system against the need to protect the individual from arbitrary invasions of
his privacy and property. 
<P>

...
<P>

...in construing and applying such statutes, it needs to be kept in mind that
they authorize the invasion of interests which the
common law has always valued
highly and which, through the writ of trespass, it went to great lengths to
protect.  Against that background,
the enactment of conditions which must be
fulfilled before a search warrant can be lawfully issued and executed is to be
seen as
a reflection of the legislature's concern to give a measure of
protection to these interests.  To insist on strict compliance with
the
statutory conditions governing the issue of search warrants is simply to give
effect to the purpose of the legislation.
<P>

12    	Dealing with the requirement of reasonable grounds,
their Honours continued (at 112):
<P>

When a statute prescribes that there must be "reasonable grounds" for a state
of mind -- including suspicion and belief --  it requires
the existence of
facts which are sufficient to induce that state of mind in a reasonable person.
...   ...it must appear to the issuing
justice, not merely to the person
seeking the search warrant, that reasonable grounds for the relevant suspicion
and belief exist.
<P>

13    	The question for a court reviewing the issue of a
warrant is not whether the justice was satisfied of reasonable grounds
but
whether, on the material presented, he or she should have been so satisfied:
<i>Patten v Justice of the Peace, Redfern Court </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2022%20ACrim%20R%2094" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 22 ACrim R 94</a> at 98.
A valuable statement of the principles governing this area, together with a
summary of the relevant authorities, is to be
found in the decision of Finlay J
in <i>Jackson v Mijovich </i>(Finlay J, unreported, 22 March 1991) at pp8-16.
His Honour observed (at p13) that a justice issuing a warrant "must act
independently
and judicially; and I would add, with great care".
<P>

14    	Several of the cases to which I was referred,
including <i>Jackson v Mijovich </i>itself, were concerned with the question
whether there were reasonable grounds for the issue of a warrant.  These
involved an examination
of the adequacy of the material that was before the
justice and, in particular, whether further information should have been sought
before the warrant was issued.  The researches of the plaintiff's solicitor and
counsel for the second defendant were unable to produce
a case where, as here,
the justice had been given supplementary information which was false.
<P>

15    	In the light of the authorities, it is clear that I
must consider the question whether there were reasonable grounds for
the issue
of the warrant by reference only to the material that was before the justice.
I consider that the objection by the plaintiff's
solicitor to the evidence of
what transpired when the search was conducted was well founded, and I do not
propose to have regard
to it.
<P>

16    	It needs hardly be said that it is most unfortunate
that the justice was supplied with false information about the criminal
records
of the plaintiff and her husband, and it is particularly this aspect of the
matter which has troubled me.  I accept that
it was a genuine mistake on Snr
Cnst Campbell's part.  The contrary was not suggested.  Nevertheless, it is
entirely unsatisfactory
that information of such significance should have been
supplied without reference at that time to police records, and based purely
upon recollection of material which had been perused some days earlier.  To
have checked those records before answering the justice's
question was
essential and, in the circumstances, would have occasioned no inconvenience or
delay.  The lesson to be learned is that
a police officer applying for the
issue of a search warrant should have all relevant documentation immediately to
hand, so that any
queries by the justice can be answered accurately.
<P>

17    	However, counsel for the second defendant submitted
that, if the information about the criminal histories were put aside,
the
remaining material was sufficient to provide reasonable grounds for the issue
of the warrant.  It is not to the point, she argued,
that the justice was
concerned to know the nature of the criminal records of the plaintiff and her
husband.  Whether the other information
was sufficient was a matter for me to
determine, conformably with the principles enunciated by Foster J in <i>Patten
</i>(supra).  Clearly, that is so.
<P>

18    	It must be remembered that material sufficient to
provide reasonable grounds for the issue of a warrant may fall short of
proof
of the offence suspected.  In <i>Parker v Churchill </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%209%20FCR%20316" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 9 FCR 316</a>,
Burchett J was dealing with a warrant issued under s10 (since repealed) of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act </i>1914</a> (Cth).  That section provided for the issue of a warrant
by a justice who was "satisfied ... that there is reasonable ground for
suspecting" one or more of the things set out in the section.  For present
purposes, I see no relevant difference between that provision
and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/swa1985175/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s6</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/swa1985175/" class="autolink_findacts">Search Warrants Act</a></i>, with which I am dealing.  As his Honour observed
(at 232), "Suspicion and belief are not of course dependent upon proof."  His
Honour
went on to refer to authority bearing on that question.  In <i>George v
Rockett </i>the Court said (at 116):
<P>

The objective circumstances sufficient to show a reason to believe something
need to point more clearly to the subject matter of
the belief, but that is not
to say that the objective circumstances must establish on the balance of
probabilities that the subject
matter in fact occurred or exists: the assent of
belief is given on more slender evidence than proof.  Belief is an inclination
of
the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting, a proposition and the
grounds which can reasonably induce that inclination
of the mind may, depending
on the circumstances, leave something to surmise or conjecture.
<P>

19    	After careful reflection, I have concluded that the
submission of counsel for the second defendant is sound.  True it is
that the
initial information about the activities of the plaintiff and her husband,
emanating from their fourteen year old daughter,
called for scrutiny.  On the
face of it, one might question the motive of a teenage girl making such an
allegation against her parents
and might feel the need to inquire whether,
apart from their alleged criminal activity, there were problems in her
relationship with
them.  It appears that no such inquiry was made by Snr Cnst
Campbell or, more importantly, the justice.  The need for scrutiny was
not
lessened by the fact that Keira herself was named in two of the intelligence
reports as being involved in the distribution of
drugs. 
<P>

20    	On the other hand, some support for her account was
afforded by the fact that police were able to confirm that a woman having
the
Christian name of the person said to be her parents' supplier lived at premises
in Brighton-Le-Sands similar to those which she
had described.  In addition,
her allegation was consistent with the intelligence reports spanning a period
of some months prior to
the issue of the warrant.  Keira's information that her
parents were receiving stolen property was spare indeed and, of itself, could
not have justified a warrant.  However, the same cannot be said of her
allegation that they were dealing in drugs.  The material
bearing on that
question, viewed in its totality, was sufficient to constitute reasonable
grounds for the issue of the warrant.
<P>

21    	Accordingly, the plaintiff has not made out a case
for the relief which she seeks.  The summons should be dismissed.  I shall
hear
the parties on costs.
