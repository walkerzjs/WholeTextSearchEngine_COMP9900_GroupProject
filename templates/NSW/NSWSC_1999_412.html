ANOR</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  The contest between the parties in this matter is whether or not
an order should be made for the appointment of trustees
to hold the property on
statutory trust for sale or whether an order should be made for the appointment
of trustees to hold the property
on statutory trust for partition.
<P>

The property, which is the subject of the proceedings, comprises the land in
folio identifiers 12/733307, 13/828889 and 14/828889.
 The combined area of
land has a substantial frontage to Dunblane Street and also a substantial
frontage to Briggs Street, Camperdown.
 Those roads connect with Missenden
Road, Camperdown, which is a major thoroughfare in that area.
<P>

The plaintiff company is registered as proprietor of a two-thirds interest in
the whole of the land and the defendants each own
a one-sixth interest in that
land, the holdings being as tenants in common.  For some reason which does not
matter, there has clearly
been a major disagreement between the plaintiff and
the defendants as to the management of the property and its development.
<P>

The land is vacant land.  It is clear that it will be developed, probably in
the same way as the surrounding area is being developed,
it being zoned under
South Sydney Council Plan as No. 10 Mixed Use Zoning.   That would allow the
construction of unit development
for residential purposes on the property,
although the council would have some discretion as to what was allowed.  The
floor space
ratio in the area is 1.5:1 and, on the evidence of one of the
valuers, may allow a total number of dwelling units of twenty-two to
be placed
on the property, assuming the floor area of 90 square metres for each such
unit.  That would appear to be a maximum development,
which Mr Koh, an
architect engaged by the defendants, says is unlikely to be achieved.  I accept
his evidence that it is highly unlikely
that a development would be achieved of
twenty-two dwelling spaces of that size, there being requirements for setback,
access and
like considerations which would make it unlikely that such a high
use could be achieved.
<P>

The defendants wish to retain part of the property.  They say that they
purchased it with that in mind and that, if the property
is sold, they will
have to acquire another development property at some disadvantage to them.
<P>

There is some evidence, which I think should be given little weight, of the
capital gains tax effect which would be brought about
by a sale of the property
as a whole as opposed to the partition of the property and the retention of
part of that property by the
defendants.  The reason I say that little weight
should be given to it is that there is no evidence of the tax affairs of either
party and (it is difficult to accept that abstract evidence of the effect of
one particular transaction is reliable so far as the
tax liabilities of these
parties are concerned).
<P>

There is little purpose in setting out descriptions of the properties held in
the three titles other than to say that what might
be described as the property
having a major frontage to Briggs Street also has a reasonable frontage to
Dunblane Street, so that
if there is to be some partition then the partition
which is envisaged is one under which there would be two blocks provided, the
property having the Briggs Street frontage being limited to that, so that the
two lots along the Dunblane Street frontage at the
present time would be added
to that part of the Briggs Street frontage property which is between those two
lots fronting Dunblane
Street.  The subdivision proposed by the defendants
would bring about two lots, that facing Dunblane Street having an area of
558.75
square metres and that facing Briggs Street having an area of 782.55
square metres.  There may be some little discrepancy in that,
but that, in
general, is the area.
<P>

The evidence of Mr Mangioni, the valuer for the defendants, is that the
properties, valued separately in accordance with the proposed
subdivision, are
worth more than the properties as a whole.  That valuation of Mr Mangioni, at
least in the first instance, put forward
a figure of $900,000 for the proposed
lot fronting Briggs Street and $800,000 for the proposed lot fronting Dunblane
Street with
a figure of $1,600,000 for the total site.  In other words, on that
valuation made in November 1998, there is a difference of $100,000
between the
total value of the two blocks valued separately and the value of the land as a
whole.
<P>

In a subsequent affidavit sworn a few days ago, the same valuer increased the
value of the Briggs Street property by $200,000. 
He was cross-examined about
this and, as I understood his evidence, explained it by having given further
consideration to a comparable
sale of a Briggs Street property, but it is fair
to say that I did not think his explanation of the increase was convincing.
However,
it must be borne in mind that in this matter the defendants seeking
partition are offering what is generally described as equality
money on the
basis of that higher figure giving the plaintiff/cross-defendant the option of
picking whichever lot he wishes to take
in the event that a partition into two
lots is ordered.  Mr Mangioni valued the property having regard to comparable
sales, checking
this, in a somewhat unconvincing way, against what might be
described as the land cost per dwelling for other nearby developments.
<P>

The valuer called by the plaintiff, Mr Feilich of Messrs Dyson Austen, did not
consider comparable values a satisfactory way of
valuing this property, saying,
as I understood it, that it was a special site, he would have described it as
unique, and saying that
all properties in the area had their certain qualities
and, for development sites, a hypothetical development calculation method
of
valuation was more reliable.  On that basis, relying on the views of Mr Koh as
to what development could reasonably be approved
and constructed on the
combined site and on each of the subdivided sites, he came to the same
conclusion as did Mr Mangioni for the
total site, namely $1,600,000, but he
said that if each of the properties were sold separately then the total which
would be achieved
would be lower and his value for the Dunblane Street lot was
$690,000 and, for the Briggs Street lot, $770,000, bringing about a
total if
the properties were valued separately of $1,460,000. 
<P>

The reason why the lower figure was arrived at was, to a large extent, based on
the views of Mr Koh as to there being a larger development
available on the
total site as against the combined development available if the sites were
treated separately, there being, in the
latter case, additional requirements
for access, setback, underground parking and the like which would not need to
be doubled-up
in a single development.  In other words, he considered that the
realisations would be less on a two lot basis than on a combined
basis, thereby
reducing the value of the site.
<P>

In ordinary circumstances, in another place, the difference in valuation
methods may be more significant than, in my view, it is
in this case.  It is
fair to say that it would be difficult to accept either value on its face.  The
reason for that is that the
evidence of Mr Koh convinced me that obtaining the
density of development put forward by the cross-claimants was quite unlikely.
As against that, the hypothetical development calculation put forward by Mr
Feilich as the basis of his conclusions was entirely
based on the rather
conservative view of Mr Koh of the development which could be put on the land
and of the type of development
which it was likely would be put on the land.
<P>

The reason why I say it is not as significant in this case as it might
otherwise be to determine which, if either, valuer should
be accepted is that
the defendants, who are, of course, endeavouring to show that the partition
would be beneficial to the majority
interest holders, are prepared to accept
and in fact offer an order under which the plaintiff would have the option of
acquiring
either of the lots and of being paid equality money adjusted on the
basis of the higher figures put forward by the defendants/cross-claimants.
Those higher figures include the figure of $1.1 million put forward in the end
by Mr Mangioni in respect of the Briggs Street property.
 Thus, if an order for
partition were made as proposed by the cross-claimants and the plaintiff took
the smaller of the two lots
then the plaintiff would receive that lot having,
on the basis of the evidence of Mr Mangioni, a value of $800,000 together with
equality money of $471,447.75, based on the figure of $1,100,000 for the Briggs
Street property put forward by Mr Mangioni in his
final valuation.
<P>

Under the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66G</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a>, where a co-owner
applies for the appointment of trustees on statutory trust for sale, the Court
has the power to make an order for
partition of the property if the other
co-owners satisfy the Court that partition would be more beneficial for the
co-owners interested
to the extent of upwards of a moiety in value than in
sale.  In this case, of course, it is the plaintiff whom the Court must be
satisfied would be in a more beneficial position on partition than on sale.
Even so, the matter is still in the discretion of the
Court and the Court is
not bound to make an order for partition in such circumstances, the position
being that it cannot do so unless
those circumstances exist.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">(Section 66G(4)).</a>
Sale and partition remain as true alternatives;  <b><cite>Re:
Cordingley</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1948/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1948] NSWStRp 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281948%29%2048%20SR%28NSW%29%20248" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1948) 48 SR(NSW) 248.</a>
<P>

It is, I think, important to understand that if an order were made for the
appointment of trustees for sale there is no particular
reason why those
trustees should not be given power, if they did not otherwise have power, to
consolidate and/or subdivide the total
area of land in whatever way they
thought would bring about the best sale and it has not been suggested
otherwise.  Nevertheless,
it has not been suggested that there is any better
subdivision available than that which is put forward by the cross-claimants as
a proper basis for partition and that, I think, is obvious enough in view of
what might be described as the straight line approach
which would be expected
to make the design of any development easier.
<P>

The land in question in total has an area of 1,341.3 square metres.  The
entitlement of the plaintiff on an area basis is 894.2
square metres.  On the
subdivision or partition put forward, if the plaintiff took the larger block,
then the area which the plaintiff
would obtain would be 782.5 square metres, a
reduction of 112 square metres in the area of mathematical entitlement, being a
reduction
of about 12.5 percent in land area as against actual entitlement.  If
that partition came about then equality money of $159,914 would
be paid by the
cross-claimants to the plaintiff/cross-defendant. 
<P>

If the plaintiff elected, as it is proposed it should be entitled to do, to
take the smaller block then the position would be that
it would obtain a very
substantial amount of money by way of an equality payment but, on the other
hand, would receive an area of
land 336 square metres less than its entitlement
on an area basis. No other method of partition has been put forward and it has
not
been suggested that trustees should be appointed to work out some other
form of partition; in other words this case has gone forward
on the basis that
the partition, which is probably best shown in the annexure to the affidavit of
McNeil Ingham sworn 25 February
1999, was the appropriate partition.  In spite
of that I should say that as the plaintiff opposes partition it could not be
expected
to propose another scheme, and there is no reason to think that a
scheme which made a large block closed to an area of 89 square
metres could not
be achieved.
<P>

I have come to the conclusion, I should say with some regret, that I do not
think that an order should be made for partition along
those lines.  The reason
for that is that I think it would be only in most unusual circumstances that
some sort of option would be
given to the party with the majority interest
seeking to have a sale under which they could take whatever part they wished,
but then
be subject to differing amounts of equality money.  It would not be
impossible, but taking into account entitlements to land on an
area value it
would be unusual that this would be appropriate.  Thus, while it might seem
entirely reasonable for the plaintiff to
take the smaller block of land and a
vast amount of equality money, there seems to be no reason in principle for the
Court to think
that that would be a proper order to make if the option of the
larger block did not exist.  In other words, to make an order for
partition
under which the majority interest holder would take an area so much smaller
than its actual interest on an area basis would,
in my view, not be reasonable
and I do not think it would be likely that an order for payment of equality
moneys of an amount in
the figure of $471,447 would be the type of evening-up
which is envisaged by the old-fashioned idea of owelty moneys.  Neither do
I
think that, in the circumstances which exist here, the Court should make an
order under which the plaintiff would receive an area
of land 12.5 percent less
than its entitlement on an area basis with a figure for equality money of
nearly $160,000, which once again
I think is far in excess of the ordinary
figure which would be envisaged for adjustment between the parties on a
partition of what
is vacant land, it not being suggested that the situation is
anything like that which has existed in other partition cases where
reasonably
substantial equality moneys might have been ordered because of the different
values of houses which would be taken by
each party on the partition.  While I
acknowledge that the advantage equity had over the law is that pecuniary
compensation could
be ordered in cases where partition upon actual entitlements
is not desirable,  (See <u>Story: Equity Jurisprudence 7th Ed</u> s654 and the
cases cited in 5) the particular circumstances are very important.  This is
vacant land and it is not known that a partition
according to true entitlements
is not sensible or appropriate.
<P>

One of the reasons why I have hesitated is that it might be thought that what
the plaintiff should do is to accept what is an offer
of the smaller area of
land and a suitable amount of money and, if the plaintiff does not wish to
retain that land, then allowing
it to sell it as it wishes for whatever sum can
be got for it on the basis that I prefer the evidence of Mr Mangioni as to its
value
to that of Mr Feilich.  The difficulty about that is that the partition
should not be ordered on the basis that the party who does
not want it can just
go ahead and sell the land left to him, that land having a substantially lesser
area than the area of land to
which he is in fact entitled, taking the risk of
getting for that what is available on the open market.  It seems to me that,
when
those circumstances arise, the plaintiff is entitled to have the order for
appointment of trustees for sale made and I propose to
make that order.  As I
say, I do so with some reluctance, but it seems clear enough that the parties
are determined not to agree
and thus that is the order that I am required to
make in this case.
<P>

I have been asked to make some particular orders as to the method in which a
sale should be conducted.  In my view, that is not
appropriate once trustees
are appointed.  However, I reiterate that it is for those trustees to determine
how that land should be
sold and to save any difficulties or doubt about that I
will make an appropriate order giving them power to sell it as a whole or
in
lots as they think fit with power to consolidate the lots and re-subdivide as
they think fit.  In addition, each of the parties
will be given the right to
bid at the sale.  I do not think it appropriate for the Court to set a reserve
price, but no doubt the
trustees when doing that will take into account the
valuations which are in evidence before the Court.
<P>

I make orders in accordance with the document called "Orders" initialled by me
and dated today.
