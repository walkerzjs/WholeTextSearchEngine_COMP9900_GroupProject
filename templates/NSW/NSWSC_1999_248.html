<P>

<b>Judgment on Cross Claim</b>
<P>

1	On 14 August 1998 I gave judgment in this matter, finding that the plaintiff
was entitled to recover against both defendants and
apportioning liability
between the defendants pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s5(2)</a> of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act </i>1946</a>.  I recorded the fact that the second defendant,
Redken claimed complete indemnity by the first defendant, Achievement Concepts
on
the basis of the contract between them.  That contract was oral, and Redken
claimed an implied term that "the design, set-up and
supervision of the
activities would be carried out" by Achievement Concepts "with all due care and
skill, so as to protect so far
as possible the employees of the second
defendant from injury".  Arising from that implied term, Redken claimed to be
entitled to
indemnity by Achievement Concepts for any amount for which it might
be found liable to the plaintiff.
<P>

2	Achievement Concepts denied any such implied term or, if there were such a
term, that it entitled Redken to the indemnity it sought.
 Alternatively, it
alleged contributory negligence on the part of Redken leading to a reduction of
any damages it might recover pursuant
to the contract. 
<P>

3	The question to be resolved is not an easy one and, as it did not appear to
me that it had been adequately argued in final submissions
at the hearing, I
invited further submissions from counsel for the defendants.  I have since had
the benefit of written submissions
and oral argument.
<P>

4	Counsel for Redken relied upon <i>Florida Hotels Pty Ltd v Mayo &amp;
Anor</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1965/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1965] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281965%29%20113%20CLR%20588" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1965) 113 CLR 588.</a>  In that case the appellant had engaged the
respondents as architects for the purpose of construction of a swimming pool.
The appellant
did not engage a builder and the work was undertaken by its own
employees.  In the course of pouring concrete some reinforcing mesh
was
improperly laid by the employees, so that its reinforcing strength was
substantially reduced.  This work was done in the absence
of the respondents.
Later, when the formwork was removed a concrete slab collapsed, causing severe
injuries to one of the employees.
<P>

5	The injured employee sued the appellant and those proceedings were settled,
with judgment being entered for the plaintiff.  The
appellant then took third
party proceedings against the respondents, claiming contribution or indemnity
under the 1946 Act and damages
for breach of contract.  The breach alleged was
the respondents' failure to supervise the placement of the reinforcing steel
mesh.
 It was common ground that part of the respondents' retainer was to
provide "such periodical supervision and inspection as may be
necessary to
ensure that the works are being executed in general accordance with the
contract".
<P>

6	The primary judge found that the appellant was entitled to a 20 per cent
contribution from the respondents under the Act, but
was entitled to complete
indemnity under the contract.  That judgment was set aside by a majority of the
Full Court on the basis
that, in the circumstances proved by the evidence, the
respondents had not been shown to be in breach of their duty to supervise:
<i>Mayo v Florida Hotels Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%2065%20SR%28NSW%29%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 65 SR(NSW) 41.</a>  Sugerman J,
dissenting, would have upheld the judgment on the basis of the contractual
claim. As to this, his Honour said (at p51):
<P>

	Subject only to the reasonable foreseeability of the injury suffered as liable
to result from the breach, the owner is, then, entitled
to recover from the
architect the damages which he has had to pay to an injured person.  Thus a
measure of indemnity is afforded
by contract, which, where it exists, is
different from and independent of the right to contribution under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law
Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act</a> </i>and results in a full indemnity
(see<i> Lister v Romford Ice and Cold Storage Co</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1956/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1956] UKHL 6</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1957%5d%20AC%20555" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1957] AC 555).</a> 
<P>

7	The appellant succeeded in the High Court and the judgment at first instance
was restored.  The leading judgment was delivered
by Barwick CJ, with whom
Kitto, Taylor and Menzies JJ agreed.  Windeyer J also agreed in a separate
judgment.  One of the matters
argued in the High Court was that, assuming the
respondents to be in breach of their contract, "the liability of the appellant
to
the plaintiff was not damage for which the respondents could be made
responsible" because of that breach: see the judgment of Barwick
CJ at 597.
The manner in which the Chief Justice disposed of that argument is of
importance to the resolution of the matter which
I must decide. What his Honour
said was this (at 598): 
<P>

	But, in my opinion, the possibility of liability of the appellant to its
workmen flowing from the consequences of lack of supervision
of work of the
kind in question must be taken to have been fairly within the contemplation of
the parties.  His Honour, the trial
judge, found the lack of supervision to be
the cause of the collapse of the slab and the removal of the formwork but the
occasion
for it; because of the inherent weakness for want of proper
reinforcement, it would have fallen down whenever the formwork was removed;
and
with this conclusion I respectfully agree.  Of course, <i>vis-a-vis </i>the
plaintiff the premature removal of the formwork was negligent on the part of
the appellant.  But this would not prevent the appellant
recovering from the
respondents for their breach of contract simply because they are therefore
joint tortfeasors with the appellant.
 It would be otherwise if the effect of
the respondents' breach of their obligation to the appellant had become spent
and no longer
causally connected with the plaintiff's injury.  But that is not
this case.  The intervention of the appellant's act in removing
the timber,
though it occasioned the injury to the plaintiff, will not avail the
respondents.  The respondents, in my opinion, are
liable to the appellant for
the amount which the appellant reasonably paid to the plaintiff in discharge of
its liability to the
plaintiff for the consequences of the collapse of the
slab.
<P>

8	Wood J (as he then was) had occasion to consider this authority in his
judgment in <i>Taylor v Leach &amp; Sons Pty Ltd</i> (Wood J, unreported 23
October 1984), to which I was also referred by counsel for Redken.  That was an
action under the <i>Compensation to Relatives Act</i>, 1867 by the widow of a
man who had been killed in the course of his employment by the defendant.  He
was electrocuted while using
a vacuum cleaner.  Prior to the accident the
cleaner had been repaired by an electrical contractor, against whom the
defendant brought
a cross claim.  His Honour found that the contractor had
caused the cleaner to be wired incorrectly.  However, that was not the sole
cause of the accident.  The deceased had used an extension cord in which the
neutral and active wires were internally reversed. 
It was the combination of
the incorrect wiring of the cleaner and the reversed polarity of the extension
cord which caused the electrocution.

<P>

9	There was evidence that extension cords with cross-polarity of this kind were
not uncommon.  His Honour found that the condition
of the extension cord used
by the deceased was the responsibility of another employee of the defendant.
His Honour summarised his
findings of fact in this way (at p20):
<P>

	...it is proper to record my finding that the cleaner as wired was potentially
dangerous, and my further finding that an electrical
contractor, acting
reasonably, should have been aware of the fact that extension cords with
cross-polarity are commonly encountered.
The potentially disastrous effects of
the two conditions coming into combination should have been within the
realisation of a competent
electrician, as should have the need to carefully
test all circuits that had been worked on to eliminate the risks flowing from
incorrect
connections and defective earthings.
<P>

10	His Honour then considered the law relating to the responsibility of an
employer who engages an independent contractor to maintain
and repair the
equipment used by its employees, and concluded that the employer remains
responsible in law for the negligence of
such a contractor (p30).  His Honour
found the defendant liable for "the defective and dangerous plant made
available" to the deceased.
 His Honour continued (at p31):
<P>

	So far as the defect concerned the flex, I find that was attributable to the
negligence of its own employee; and so far as it concerned
the unsafe wiring of
the cleaner, that was attributable to negligence in and about the maintenance
and repair of that unit carried
out for the defendant by the cross defendant as
the independent contractor retained by it for such purpose.
<P>

11	Pursuant to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act</a>, </i>his Honour
considered that the electrical contractor should bear 80 per cent of the
damages to which the plaintiff was entitled. 
However, the cross claim also
alleged the contractor's breach of an implied term of the contract for repair
and maintenance, being
the failure "to repair and maintain the vacuum cleaner
in a good and workmanlike manner, so that it was safe for use".  His Honour
noted that the contract and the implied term were admitted on the pleadings,
although the breach was denied.  After consideration
of <i>Florida Hotels</i>
and, in particular, the dissenting judgment of Sugerman J in the Full Court,
his Honour concluded that the defendant was entitled
to full indemnity for the
damages and costs which he proposed to award against it in favour of the
plaintiff (p34).
<P>

12	Those cases can be distinguished from the present case in two significant
respects.  Firstly, in both of them it was accepted
that there was a
contractual term of the kind alleged: in <i>Florida Hotels</i> an express
requirement for the architects to provide periodic supervision and inspection,
and in <i>Taylor v Leach</i> an implied undertaking by the electrical
contractor to repair and maintain the vacuum cleaner in a good and workmanlike
manner. 
In the present case, Achievement Concepts denied that the term alleged
in the cross claim by Redken should be implied.  At most,
it was argued, such a
term merely restated the common law duty of care which Achievement Concepts
acknowledged it owed to Redken's
employees.  Counsel for Achievement Concepts
referred to a passage from the judgment of Deane J in <i>Hawkins v Clayton</i>
(1988) 164 CLR 539 at 583:
<P>

	To the extent that the content and incidents of the contractual duty of care
correspond with those of the ordinary duty of care
under the common law of
negligence, the implication of a general contractual term is difficult to
rationalize.  If the implication
of the term is based upon some perceived
general principle of law, one is led to ask why the common law should imply a
contractual
term imposing a duty of care which the common law imposes in any
event.  If the implication of the term is based upon the imputed
intention of
the parties, it is difficult to see how any of the ordinary tests for the
implication of a term on that basis could
properly be seen as satisfied.  It
could not be sensibly said that it is necessary for the business efficacy or
the reasonable or
effective operation of a contract to imply a contractual term
imposing a general duty which corresponds with the general duty which
already
exists under the common law. 
<P>

13	From an earlier passage in the judgment (at 571-3), it is clear that Deane
J's remarks were directed to implied terms, whether
the implication is said to
arise in fact or by law. (That distinction was explained by the Court of
Appeal, with reference to authority,
in <i>Australis Media Holdings v Telstra
Corporation </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 104</a> at 122-3).  The High Court was dealing with
a case involving the duty owed by solicitors to a testatrix for whom they had
prepared
a will.  Applying his reasoning to the facts of the case, his Honour
concluded (at 585):
<P>

	...the imputation of a relevant contractual term should be confined to what is
justified by ordinary principles governing the implication
of a term on the
basis of the imputed intention of the parties, which, in a case such as the
present where the parties have not sought
to express all of the terms of the
contract between them, is what can be seen to be necessary for the effective or
reasonable operation
of that contract.  Plainly it is not necessary for either
the effective or reasonable operation of the contract between the firm
and the
testatrix that there should be superimposed upon the duty of care which the
firm owed the testatrix under the common law
of negligence a concurrent
contractual duty of care of co-extensive content.
<P>

14	Counsel for Redken did not submit that the implied term here included an
obligation on the part of Achievement Concepts to indemnify
Redken for any
liability it might incur arising from its own negligence.  Rather, he argued
that, in the circumstances of the case,
such an indemnity was the "ultimate
result" of Achievement Concepts' breach of the implied term alleged: that it
would conduct the
activity with due care and skill, so as to avoid as far as
possible injury to any of Redken's employees.  It was for this purpose
that
reliance was placed upon <i>Florida Hotels</i> and <i>Taylor v Leach</i>.  I
was also referred to <i>The Dredge "WH Goomai" v Australian Oil Refining Pty
Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20Aust%20Torts%20Reports%2080%2d241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) Aust Torts R 80-241</a>, in which the reasoning of the High Court in
<i>Florida Hotels </i>was applied: see the judgment of McHugh JA (as he then
was), with whom Hope and Clarke JJA agreed, at 68,580-1.
<P>

15	Guided by the observations of Deane J in<i> Hawkins v Clayton</i>  to which
I have referred, I am not satisfied that the term alleged by Redken should be
implied in its agreement with Achievement
Concepts.  However, even if it were,
I am not persuaded that its breach would entitle Redken to the indemnity which
it seeks.  This
brings me to the second matter which distinguishes this case
from cases such as <i>Florida Hotels</i> and <i>Taylor v Leach</i>.
<P>

16	I think there is force in the submission of counsel for Achievement Concepts
that indemnities were awarded in those cases because,
notwithstanding the
negligence of one party to the contract, the breach of contract by the other
party was the anterior and primary
cause of the plaintiff's loss.  In
<i>Florida Hotels</i>, the effect of the reasoning of Barwick CJ in the passage
quoted in paragraph seven of these reasons is that it was the lack of
supervision
by the architects which led to the incorrect placing of the
reinforcing mesh.  Windeyer J (at 601) was in general agreement with
the
analysis of Sugerman J in the Full Court.  Sugerman J (at p51 of the report of
the Full Court's decision) had said:
<P>

	In cases such as are now in question there will also be a want of due care on
the part of some employee of the owner in proceeding
contrary to the plans and
specifications.  But this is the very thing which the supervising architect is
employed, by reasonable
measures of general supervision, to guard against. 
<P>

17	Wood J took the same approach in <i>Taylor v Leach</i>.  From the passage of
the judgment quoted in paragraph nine of these reasons, it appears that his
Honour saw the incorrect wiring
of the vacuum cleaner as the primary cause of
the accident, particularly as the electrical contractor should have foreseen
that an
extension cord with cross-polarity might have been used.  To the same
effect on this aspect is the decision in <i>The Dredge "WH Goomai"</i>, the
facts of which  I do not propose to recite.  It is sufficient to say that one
tortfeasor was held liable to indemnify another
because the breach of contract
by the first tortfeasor was anterior to, and had facilitated, the breach of
duty by the other.  
<P>

18	The two-fold basis upon which I found Redken liable to the plaintiff is set
out at pages 13-14 of my judgment of 14 August 1998.
 The first basis is the
failure of the plaintiff's fellow employees adequately to support her, but I am
prepared to disregard this
for present purposes.  It is the second basis which
is relevant: that is, the failure of senior executives at Redken to attend the
site and assess the safety of the exercise, particularly before it was
undertaken.  That lack of care on the part of Redken was an
anterior cause of
the plaintiff's loss, just as much as the inadequate preparation and
supervision of the exercise by Achievement
Concepts.  The extent to which
Achievement Concepts should bear a greater responsibility for that loss, given
its professed expertise
in the area, is reflected in the apportionment at which
I arrived in my earlier judgment.
<P>

19	Accordingly, Redken is not entitled to a complete indemnity by Achievement
Concepts in respect of its liability to the plaintiff.
 Insofar as it relies
upon an implied term in the contract, the cross claim must fail.  I will hear
the parties on costs.
