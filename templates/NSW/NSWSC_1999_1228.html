<b><u>070007/98 - REGINA  v  STUART JOHN HOWARD</u></b>
<P>

<b> </b>
<P>

<b><u>SENTENCE</u></b>
<P>

 
<P>

1   	<b>HER HONOUR</b>:   On 6 December 1999 Stuart John Howard
was arraigned before me on an indictment charging him that on 15 November 1997
at Greenacre
he did murder Shane Usher.  He entered a plea of not guilty and a
jury was duly empanelled. On 10 December 1999 the jury returned
a verdict of
guilty of manslaughter.
<P>

2   	The prisoner was aged thirty-one at the date of the
offence. He had been friendly with the deceased, who was also aged in his
early
thirties, for about two and a half years. Both were living with their
respective de facto partners in a block of units at 23
Marlene Crescent,
Greenacre.
<P>

3   	Around June 1997 there was a deterioration in the
relationship between the two men.  The deceased borrowed a guitar belonging
to
the prisoner's partner, Colleen Lyons. Some time later the prisoner came to
learn that the guitar had been pawned by the deceased.
Further, the deceased
had borrowed some money from Ms Lyons, the bulk of which had not been
repaid.
<P>

4   	The deceased's younger brother, Jamie McCissock, was then
on friendly terms with the prisoner.  Again, around mid-1997 Jamie
had a
falling out with his older brother and moved into the prisoner's flat.  It
appears that the prisoner considered that the deceased
had treated Jamie and
his partner, Crystal, shabbily.  A combination of these matters led the
prisoner to develop a growing resentment
towards the deceased.
<P>

5   	On the evening of Saturday, 15 November 1997, the prisoner
telephoned Jamie McCissock.  He had not seen Jamie for the past
fortnight and
appears to have been somewhat annoyed that Jamie had resolved his differences
with the deceased. During the course
of this telephone call the prisoner made
reference to his dispute with the deceased. During the course of the trial
there was some
controversy concerning the content of this call.  Jamie and
Crystal gave an account that the prisoner had made some unspecified threat
towards the deceased by reference to a gun.  The prisoner denied making any
threats or referring to a gun.  He agreed in the course
of his evidence that
when the deceased called to his home later that night he, the deceased, had
asked, "What's this I hear about
a gun?" I accept that some reference was made
to a gun in the course of the call. It does not appear that the threat was
taken seriously
by Jamie  McCissock or by the deceased. However, it prompted
the two of them to call to the prisoner's home later that evening.
<P>

6   	At about 10.30pm Jamie McCissock and the deceased knocked
at the prisoner's front door.  The prisoner called out asking who
was at the
door.  McCissock replied, "It's Jamie". The prisoner opened the door and the
deceased forced his way into the premises
knocking the prisoner to the floor.
At that point the deceased was in an aggressive mood. He threatened the
prisoner saying words
to the effect, "If you don't stop threatening us we are
not the ones going to be hurt, it is you".  Jason Post, an old friend of
the
prisoner, was also present.  The deceased turned to Post and said, "Sit the
fuck down or I"ll kill you too".  Shortly after this
things appeared to calm
down somewhat.  The deceased walked over to Post and shook him by the hand
speaking to him in quite friendly
terms.  The prisoner had regained his feet by
this stage.  There appears to have been some brief discussion concerning the
debt owed
by the deceased to the prisoner. The prisoner walked to his kitchen,
picked up a carving knife and returned to the lounge area of
the flat. He was
observed by both Jamie McCissock and Jason Post to run towards the deceased and
to stab him.
<P>

7   	The deceased suffered two stab wounds, one to the left
chest which penetrated to a depth of 14.5 centimetres and severed the
aorta.
This was the fatal wound.  A second wound was sustained in the region of the
front left shoulder. This penetrated to a depth
of 13 centimetres. Neither of
the witnesses saw more than one apparently deliberate stab wound. The deceased
collapsed shortly after
the infliction of the wound.
<P>

8   	The prisoner ran from the unit. He appears to have been in
a state of considerable distress. He ran some distance to a hotel.
He made a
reverse charge telephone call to his father who lived in a suburb not far away.
He caught a taxi to the father's home.
By this time police were waiting at the
family home and the prisoner was arrested.  At the time of his arrest he
said:
<P>

"Where's my Dad? I'm sorry Dad, please forgive me. I didn't mean to do
anything. I didn't mean to do it. You don't know the pressure
I've been under.
I've been under pressure. If they understood the pressure I've been under
lately. It's not my fault. I didn't mean
to stab him.  I love Shane, I would
never mean to hurt him. Please have mercy Dad. Have mercy. Have mercy Dad. I
wish I could have
swapped with you Dad and gone to war and been killed. I wish
I could replay my life".
<P>

9   	The prisoner was interviewed in the early hours of the
following morning. Generally, in that interview he gave an account that
he had
been under a great deal of pressure in the weeks leading up to the killing. He
could not explain the stabbing beyond asserting
he had lost control in
consequence of these pressures.  He also spoke of being in fear of the
deceased. In this regard he commented
on the deceased's appearance.  The
deceased had a mohawk style of haircut with his head closely shaved at the
sides. He was wearing
army camouflage pants.  It appears that the prisoner had
not seen the deceased sporting this hair style and it had caused some added
alarm when the deceased burst into the unit that night.
<P>

10   	The prisoner denied having any intention to kill or to do
grievous bodily harm.  Indeed, although he accepted that he had
been
responsible for the infliction of both stab wounds, it was his account that he
did not remember the stabbing.
<P>

11   	Manslaughter (as an alternative to murder) was left both
upon the basis of an unlawful and dangerous act, in the event that
the jury had
a doubt as to the proof of the intent for murder, and provocation.  Mr Wetmore,
who appears for the prisoner, accepts
that the proper basis for me to approach
sentence is that the prisoner's culpability for murder was reduced to
manslaughter by provocation.
 To my mind that is clearly so.
<P>

12   	I should note that both in his interview with the police
and in evidence the prisoner described an incident in August 1997
in which the
deceased had called him out of his flat and threatened him. This arose in the
context of some concern on the deceased's
part that the prisoner had made a
slighting remark about the deceased's de facto partner.
<P>

13   	The deceased was the father of Tynan and Melanie.  At the
time of his tragic death his partner, Michelle Dawes, was seven
months
pregnant. She subsequently gave birth to a son, Anthony. A Victim Impact
Statement signed by Ms Dawes and dated 14 December
1999 was tendered at the
sentence hearing. Ms Dawes speaks movingly of the terrible loss that she and
members of the deceased's family
have all suffered. The Court extends its
sympathy to them in their loss.  I have regard to the observations of the
former Chief Judge
at Common Law concerning the receipt of Victim Impact
Statements pursuant to s 23C(3) of the<b> <A HREF="/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/"><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Procedure Act</a></b> 1986</A> in<b>
R v Previtera</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2094%20A%20Crim%20R%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 94 A Crim R 76</a> at 85. I adopt that approach in the
instant case.
<P>

14   	The prisoner gave evidence at his trial. He raised his
good character which was not the subject of challenge. He has one prior
conviction for an offence committed when he was a child. I put that to one side
for present purposes. He comes from a supportive
and loving family. His father
gave evidence at the trial.
<P>

15   	The prisoner left school at the end of Year 11. He
obtained an apprenticeship studying mechanics. He then went on to obtain
his
trade certificate. However, working as a mechanic was not to his liking. He
moved into employment in the spare parts industry.
At the time of his arrest he
was working for Purnell Motors Ltd. 
<P>

16   	Generally, in the years since leaving school, he has been
gainfully employed. He lived at home with his parents until he was
aged about
thirty.  He then moved out of home in order to commence living  with his de
facto partner, Ms Lyons, in the Marlene Crescent
unit. He appears to have
maintained regular contact with his parents both of whom are elderly and in
poor health.
<P>

17   	Mr Birkinshaw, who has been a neighbour of the Howard
family for some forty years, provided a reference for the prisoner.
 He has
known the prisoner throughout his lifetime. He attests to the generally good
reputation the prisoner enjoys within the community
as a hard working,
courteous and pleasant individual.  The prisoner is described by Mr Birkinshaw
as having demonstrated a great
sense of civic responsibility. The Vlahadamis
family also provided a reference attesting to the prisoner's non-violent
disposition.
 The family has lived as neighbours of the Howard family for some
twenty-one years. Mr Burgess, in a reference dated 4 December 1999,
speaks of
the close knit nature of the Howard family.  He has known the family since
1978. The prisoner, who is one of three children,
is described as having grown
up in a family with a strong sense of traditional family and social values. Mr
Burgess comments favourably
on the prisoner's close bond with his two year old
son, Brendan.
<P>

18   	At the time of his commission of the offence, the
prisoner's partner, Ms Lyons, was pregnant. The child, Brendan, was born
following the prisoner's arrest.  The prisoner was held in custody from the
date of his arrest until his release on bail on 24 December
of that year. It
was a condition of his bail that he reside with his parents. The relationship
with Ms Lyons has come to an end in
consequence of the commission of the
subject offence. However, as I have already noted, the prisoner maintains a
close level of contact
with his son.
<P>

19   	The Crown Prosecutor informed the Court that prior to the
first occasion when this matter was set down for trial, Mr Greenhill
SC, who
then appeared for the prisoner, had indicated on his client's behalf a
willingness to plead guilty to manslaughter.  The
Crown determined not to
accept that offer and the prisoner was, accordingly, indicted for murder.  I
take into account the timely
indication of a willingness to plead guilty to an
offence for which the prisoner was convicted. He is entitled to some benefit
both
for the contrition which I accept the plea evidences and on account of the
utilitarian considerations which favour some discount
in sentence upon a plea.
In this regard I take into account the observations of the court in<b> R v
Oinonen</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%20NSW%20CCA%20310" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSW CCA 310.</a>
<P>

20   	I consider the prisoner is a person with good prospects of
rehabilitation. He has employment skills and a background of family
support. I
do not consider that there are special circumstances in this case justifying a
departure from the proportion as between
the minimum term and additional term
provided in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(2)</a> of the<b> <A HREF="/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sa1989121/"><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></b> 1989</A>.
<P>

21   	I consider the prisoner has shown remorse for his offence.
The most telling evidence of this appears in  passages in the recorded
interview together with his apparent distress during that interview. There are
a number of subjective features which favour the extension
of some leniency to
the prisoner in the circumstances of this case. I have referred to those in the
course of these reasons.  Taking
those matters into account, the sentence I
impose must nonetheless reflect the seriousness of the unlawful taking of a
human life:
<b> R v Macdonald</b> (unreported, NSW CCA, 12 December 1995).
<P>

22   	The prisoner was taken into custody on 16 November 1997.
He was released on bail on 24 December 1997. He has thus spent thirty-eight
days in custody in relation to this offence. I intend to structure the sentence
in order to give the prisoner full credit for this
period of custody.
<P>

23   	I consider an appropriate minimum term to be one of five
years penal servitude.  I propose to reduce that term by thirty-eight
days in
order to reflect the pre-sentence custody.  Accordingly, the sentence I impose
will commence on 10 December 1999 and expire
on 2 November 2004. I specify an
additional term of one year and six months to commence on 3 November 2004 and
to expire on 2 May
2006.
