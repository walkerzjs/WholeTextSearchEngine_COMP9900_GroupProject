<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT (Re Hand-written Statement)  [No 3]</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>On 12 April 1996, Mr Patsalis handed police a
document.  It was a statement which he had prepared, and brought with him to
the Bankstown
Police Station.  The Prosecution, in its case against Mr Patsalis
for murder, seeks to rely upon that document.  Objection is taken
on behalf of
Mr Patsalis upon a number of grounds:
<P>

&#183;	First, it is said that the document was improperly obtained.  No warning
was administered before Mr Patsalis handed the document
to police <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s138.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s138</a>, s<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">139</a>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>).
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, and in any event, the document discloses previous offences or
discreditable conduct, offending the rules relating
to propensity evidence
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s97.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s97(1)</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>).
<P>

2  	I will deal separately with the second aspect.  It also arises in
the context of the electronically recorded interview (ERISP)
conducted with Mr
Patsalis later the same evening.  In the course of that interview, the police
invited Mr Patsalis to read the hand-written
statement, and he did so.
<P>

<b>Relevant Provision of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></b>
<P>

3  	Dealing with the first issue, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s138.html" class="autolink_findacts">s138(1)</a> is, relevantly, in these
terms:
<P>

<b>"Discretion to exclude improperly or illegally obtained evidence</b>
<P>

<b>138(1)</b>  Evidence that was obtained:
<P>

(a)  	improperly or in contravention of an Australian law;  or .....
<P>

is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence
outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that
has been obtained in
the way in which the evidence was obtained."
<P>

4  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s138.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 138(3)</a> identifies matters which the Court may take into
account in determining the issues arising under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s138.html" class="autolink_findacts">s138(1).</a>  It is in these
terms:
<P>

<b>"138(3)</b>  Without limiting the matters that the court may take into
account under subsection (1), it is to take into account:
<P>

(a)	the probative value of the evidence;  and
<P>

(b)	the importance of the evidence in the proceeding;  and
<P>

(c)	the nature of the relevant offence ...
<P>

(d)	the gravity of the impropriety or contravention;  and
<P>

(e)	whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless;
and
<P>

(f)	whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent
with a right of a person recognised by the International
Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights;  and
<P>

(g)	whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is
likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or
contravention;  and
<P>

(h)	the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or
contravention of an Australian law."
<P>

5  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 139</a> identifies circumstances in which impropriety under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s138.html" class="autolink_findacts">s138(1)(a)</a> is to be inferred.  It makes the following provision, omitting parts
not material:
<P>

<b>"Cautioning of persons</b>
<P>

<b>139(1)</b>  For the purposes of paragraph 138(1)(a), evidence of a statement
made or an act done by a person during questioning is taken to
have been
obtained improperly if:
<P>

(a)	the person was under arrest for an offence at the time;  and ...
<P>

(c)	before starting the questioning the investigating official did not caution
the person that the person does not have to say or
do anything but that
anything the person does say or do may be used in evidence."
<P>

6  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 139(5)</a> is also relevant, and is in these terms:
<P>

<b>"139(5)</b>  A reference in subsection (1) to a person who is under arrest
includes a reference to a person who is in the company of an investigating
official for the purpose of being questioned, if:
<P>

(a)	the official believes that there is sufficient evidence to establish that
the person has committed an offence that is to be
the subject of the
questioning;  or
<P>

(b)	the official would not allow the person to leave if the person wished to do
so;  or
<P>

(c)	the official has given the person reasonable grounds for believing that the
person would not be allowed to leave if he or she
wished to do so."
<P>

7  	My attention has also been drawn to s356B <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>
(introduced by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/index.html#p10a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 10A</a>, and operating from 9 February 1998), and s424A.
<P>

<b>Background to Mr Patsalis' Arrival at Bankstown</b>
<P>

8  	The victim, Mr Ludwig, died some time after 7.00 pm on Thursday
11 April 1996.  Mr Patsalis was present when he died.  He, Mr
Ludwig, and Mr
Spathis were in a truck parked by the side of the road in Botany.  Mr Patsalis
has asserted that Mr Spathis attacked
Mr Ludwig with a knife, repeatedly
stabbing him.  Mr Ludwig died immediately.  He was carrying a substantial sum
in cash.  According
to Mr Patsalis, Mr Spathis removed money from the body.  Mr
Patsalis denied any fore-knowledge or compicity in Mr Spathis' crimes,
whether
the stabbing, or the robbery.
<P>

9  	Indeed, Mr Patsalis described his horror at these events, and his
resolve to go to the police.  At 4.30 am on Friday 12 April
1996, he went to
the Hilton Hotel.  He asked for writing paper.  He began writing an account of
Mr Ludwig's death, and the background
to it.
<P>

10  	At 9.00 am, or soon thereafter, Mr Patsalis spoke to his
solicitor, Mr Coustas.  He made arrangements to see him at his Bankstown
office
later that day.  He attended Mr Coustas' office at 5.20 pm (Q11).  From there
he went directly to the Bankstown Police Station,
taking with him a twelve page
account of the background to Mr Ludwig's death.
<P>

11  	Mr Patsalis arrived at the police station at about 6.20 pm.  He
was seen briefly by Const Kelly, who was at the counter.  He
was then taken to
Det McGillicuddy.  Within a matter of minutes, Mr Patsalis handed the notes to
Det McGillicuddy.  The matter turns
upon the circumstances in which the notes
were handed over.
<P>

12  	It is common ground that no warning was administered before Mr
Patsalis provided the notes to the police.  The Crown asserts
that there was no
occasion for warning, and no impropriety.  Mr Patsalis was, at this point,
simply a witness.  Counsel for Mr Patsalis
contends otherwise.  Mr Patsalis was
a person under arrest, or in police custody, in the circumstances identified by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">s139(5).</a>  There being no warning, there was impropriety.
<P>

13  	The absence of a warning may amount to an impropriety in four
circumstances:
<P>

&#183;	First, if Mr Patsalis had already been arrested <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s139(1)(a)).</a>
<P>

&#183;	Secondly, if, before the notes were handed over, either Const Kelly or
Det Snr Const McGillicuddy believed that there was
sufficient evidence to
establish that Mr Patsalis had committed an offence which was the subject of
questioning <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s139(5)(a)).</a>
<P>

&#183;	Thirdly, if, before the notes were handed over, such officers would not
have allowed Mr Patsalis to leave the police station
had he wished to do so
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s139(5)(b)).</a>
<P>

&#183;	Fourthly, if, before the notes were handed over, either Const Kelly or
Det Snr Const McGillicuddy had given Mr Patsalis reasonable
grounds for
believing that he would not be allowed to leave if he wished to do so
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s139(5)(c)).</a>
<P>

<b>Initial Interview at Bankstown</b>
<P>

14  	Const Kelly gave the following account of his initial
conversation with Mr Patsalis:
<P>

"Mate, I witnessed a murder last night.  I was there when it happened."
<P>

15  	Const Kelly then ushered Mr Patsalis into a hallway at the rear
of the police station.  He sought the name of the person murdered,
and the
identity of the person responsible.  Mr Patsalis provided this information,
nominating Mr Spathis.
<P>

<b>Conversation with Det McGillicuddy</b>
<P>

16  	Const Kelly then took Mr Patsalis into the office of the Chief
Detective, Det Sgt Katsogiannis.  One gathers that Det McGillicuddy
was nearby.
He was apparently assigned the matter by Det Sgt Katsogiannis.  Det
McGillicuddy then addressed a number of questions
to Mr Patsalis.  The
conversation was witnessed by Const Kelly.  The account of Det McGillicuddy is
in these terms:
<P>

"I said,	`Hello.  Lindsay McGillicuddy's the name.'
<P>

He said,	`Michael.  Michael Patsalis.'
<P>

I said,		`Michael, can you tell me what you told the Constable?'
<P>

He said, 	`I witnesses a murder last night.  The body is at Terrey Hills.  He
burned it.'
<P>

I said,		`Who did the murder?'
<P>

He said,	`Alex.'
<P>

I said,		`Alex who?'
<P>

He said,	`Alex Spathis.'
<P>

I said,		`Who was killed?'
<P>

He said,	`Peter.  I don't know his name.'
<P>

I said,		`Where did this happen?'
<P>

He said,	`Botany.'
<P>

I said,		`Why was he killed?'
<P>

He said,	`Alex was going to rob him.  Peter had fifty eight and a half thousand
dollars ($58,500) on him.'
<P>

I said,		`How was Peter killed?'
<P>

He said,	`Alex just pulled out a knife and stabbed him in the neck.  I was in
the van and he bled all over me.  I rang Mr Coustas,
my solicitor, this morning
and told him.  Then I saw him this afternoon.'
<P>

I said,		`What did he say?'
<P>

He said,	`He said go to the Police.  I've made some notes.'"
<P>

17  	Mr Patsalis then handed Det McGillicuddy twelve pages of
hand-written notes.  The notes described, in some detail, Mr Patsalis'
relations with Mr Spathis, and the accumulation of a debt to Mr Spathis of
$16,500.  The notes acknowledged conduct towards Mr Spathis
which involved
forgery and deception.  The material certainly describes conduct which is
discreditable.  It is relied upon by the
Crown to support its assertion of a
joint criminal enterprise between Mr Patsalis and Mr Spathis to rob and murder
Mr Ludwig.
<P>

18  	Det McGillicuddy's Duty Book discloses that the notes were
handed to him some time shortly before 6.40 pm (in other words,
less than
twenty minutes after Mr Patsalis' arrival at the police station).  He did not
read them immediately.  Rather, he continued
to question Mr Patsalis for a
short time, culminating in the following exchange:
<P>

"I said,  `Michael, what I'd like to do is speak further with you about this.
Do you mind being interviewed on audio and video?'
<P>

He said,	`No.'"
<P>

19  	In order to prepare for the interview, Det McGillicuddy then
began reading the notes.
<P>

20  	Det McGillicuddy said that he had not noticed that Mr Patsalis
had notes before he produced them.  It was Mr Patsalis who drew
his attention
to them, and willingly handed them over.  At that point Det McGillicuddy
regarded Mr Patsalis as a witness.  He did
not have sufficient evidence to
justify an arrest.
<P>

21  	Neither Mr Patsalis nor any police officer suggested that Mr
Patsalis had been formally arrested (cf <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">s139(1)(a)).</a>  If Det McGillicuddy's
account of his conversation with Mr Patsalis is accurate, he plainly did not
have sufficient information to
establish that Mr Patsalis had committed an
offence at the time the notes were handed over (cf <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">s139(5)(a)).</a>
<P>

22  	There is a body of evidence which supports Mr McGillicuddy's
account.  First, Const Kelly gave evidence in similar terms.
<P>

23  	Secondly, Det McGillicuddy made notes the same evening
concerning the conversation.  Indeed, he made those notes in the presence
of Mr
Patsalis.  The notes were then read to Mr Patsalis, who was invited to sign the
notebook.  Mr Patsalis did so.  Later, during
the video interview, Mr Patsalis
verified to Det Hull his signature on the notes.  He was also asked the
following questions:
<P>

"Q20.  Is that a true and correct record of the conversation between yourself
and Detective Senior Constable McGillicuddy?
<P>

A.  Yes, it is.
<P>

Q21.  I also understand that when you spoke to the police here at Bankstown you
handed them a handwritten document.  Is that correct?
<P>

A.  That is correct."
<P>

24  	Thirdly, in the Duty Book of Det McGillicuddy, completed at the
end of the shift, Mr Patsalis was described as a witness:
<P>

"Then 6.30 pm speak to Det Sgt Katsogiannis, Cst Agnew &amp; Cst Kelly re
murder witness.  Then speak to Michael Patsalis re witnessing
murder @ Terry
Hills.  Patsalis hands over notes, 12 pages of steno."
<P>

25  	Finally, once Det McGillicuddy had read Mr Patsalis' notes, he
recognised an address which Mr Patsalis had referred to on the
first page,
namely 12B Restwell Street, Bankstown.  Det McGillicuddy had been asked about
that address at 5.40 pm by Det Const Cooke
of the Major Crime Squad North
(Chatswood).  When Det McGillicuddy read Mr Patsalis' notes, he inferred that
the murder described
by Mr Patsalis was the subject of an investigation by the
Major Crime Squad.  He therefore telephoned that Squad.  He was told that
detectives would come to Bankstown to interview Mr Patsalis.  Det McGillicuddy
then had the following conversation with Mr Patsalis,
which he recorded in his
notebook:
<P>

"Q21.  Michael, I have just spoken to some gentlemen from the North Region
Crime Squad.  Apparently the body has been found.  I
was going to speak to you
about what you told us, but they'd like you to wait around so they can speak to
you.
<P>

A.  Yes, I understand.  I'm prepared to wait.  I know I'm not going anywhere
for a while  I've done some things but I've never seen
a murder.  I accept the
fact that I might not leave here tonight."
<P>

26  	The question and answer were incorporated in the notes which
were signed by Mr Patsalis later that evening.  This conversation
does not
suggest that Mr Patsalis was under arrest at that point.
<P>

27  	On the basis of this evidence, were it accepted, there was no
occasion for warning by the police before the notes were handed
over.  What,
then, is said on behalf of Mr Patsalis to suggest that this evidence should not
be accepted?
<P>

<b>The Evidence of Mr Patsalis</b>
<P>

28  	Mr Patsalis identified a number of matters which suggested to
his mind that he was under arrest shortly after his arrival at
Bankstown Police
Station.  He twice asked Const Kelly if he could have a cigarette.  Being a
Government office, this would have involved
going outside.  Twice he was
refused permission.  Further, he was accompanied by a police officer wherever
he went, including to
the toilet.  During the interval between his presenting
himself at the station, and the arrival of detectives from the Major Crime
Squad (Det Hull and others), he was, at all times, accompanied by a police
officer.
<P>

29  	Much of this evidence was non-specific in terms of time.  Some
of it plainly related to events well after the notes were handed
over. What is
important is what occurred before the notes passed into the possession of the
police.  The directions allegedly given
by Const Kelly concerning cigarettes
are ambiguous.  They are consistent with a concern on Const Kelly's part for
efficiency.  Const
Kelly was on the counter.  A person had presented at the
counter who needed to be dealt with.  He was directing that person to the
detectives who would deal with him.  The circumstances described are consistent
with Const Kelly asking Mr Patsalis to postpone his
desire for a cigarette for
the time being.
<P>

30  	Mr Patsalis gave an account of the circumstances in which notes
were handed to Det McGillicuddy.  The account in Det McGillicuddy's
notebook
(which he acknowledged he signed) was inaccurate.  He did not volunteer the
notes, as Det McGillicuddy's notebook suggested.
 Rather, Det McGillicuddy had
asked him what he had in his hands (T.335).  He then identified the notes.  Det
McGillicuddy then asked
whether he could have them (T.335).  He handed them
over because he believed himself obliged to do so, and that because he was
under
arrest.  The notes were made for himself (T.337), not the police.
<P>

31  	However, for a number of reasons, I prefer the account of Det
McGillicuddy, and that of Const Kelly.  There is significant
contemporaneous
documentary support for their accounts, which I have identified.  Moreover, Mr
Patsalis' recollection more than three
years after the event was, in some
respects, unreliable.  For instance, he said this:  (T.336)
<P>

"Q.	From the time that you wrote the notes at the Hilton Hotel until you handed
them to the officer at the police station at Bankstown,
had you had any
sleep?
<P>

A.	No, I did not.  But I didn't write those notes out in the Hilton Hotel.
<P>

Q.	I am sorry.  Where were the notes written out?
<P>

A.	They were written in a taxi going to my solicitor's office, because I had
lost the original notes that I had made at the Hilton
Hotel."
<P>

32  	However, when interviewed on 12 April 1996 by Det Hull, having
identified the notes, he provided the following response to
a question asked by
Det Hull:
<P>

"Q28.	Can you tell me where and when you wrote that out?
<P>

A.	I, I wrote that out in my hotel room last night and this morning."
<P>

33  	The appearance and length of the notes, suggests that they are

<b>Other Arguments Advanced on Behalf of Mr Patsalis</b>
<P>

34  	Det McGillicuddy, at 5.50 pm, spoke to Det Const Cooke of the
Major Crime Squad at Chatswood.  He made a note of the conversation
in his Duty
Book at the end of the shift.  The note was in these terms:
<P>

"In 5.40.  Receive phone call from Tony Cook of MCS North re address of 12B
Restwell St, B'town."
<P>

35  	Det McGillicuddy was familiar with the premises.  He told Det
Cooke that it was a gambling club.  Det Cooke did not say why
he was making the
inquiry.  There was no reference to either Mr Patsalis or Mr Spathis, or
indeed, murder.
<P>

36  	Counsel for Mr Patsalis sought, and was given access to,
documents associated with the investigation of Mr Ludwig's death by
the Major
Crime Squad.  He sought to explore the possibility of knowledge, on the part of
Det McGillicuddy, of the murder investigation
before Mr Pastalis presented at
the Bankstown Police Station at 6.20 pm.  Nothing emerged from this material,
or the evidence concerning
the investigation, which supported that
suggestion.
<P>

37  	The source of the direction to Det Cooke to make an inquiry in
respect of the premises at Bankstown was Det Sgt Jacob.  Det
Jacob was in
charge of the investigation.  At approximately 5.30 pm (on Friday 12 April
1996) he was provided with a copy of Mr Ludwig's
note.  The note referred to
the first names (but not the surnames) of the two accused ("Michael" and
"Alex").  It also referred to
the premises where Mr Ludwig met "Michael",
namely 12B Restwell Street, Bankstown.  Det Jacob directed Det Cooke to make
discrete
inquiries in respect of the note.  The call from Det Cooke to Det
McGillicuddy was made as a consequence of that direction.
<P>

38  	I accept Det McGillicuddy's account.  I therefore accept that it
was not until some time after Det McGillicuddy came into possession
of the
notes (and later read them), that he made the link between Mr Patsalis and the
call from Det Cooke.
<P>

39  	Having come to the police station at 6.20 pm, Mr Patsalis was
thereafter interviewed, and taken on a journey to the various
locations which
he identified in the course of that interview.  He was thereafter charged.  The
time at which he was charged was
recorded as 6.47 am on 13 April 1996.  The
informant was Det Snr Const Hull.  The Charge Sheet was typed by Const
Jeffreys.  The
information included in the sheet was provided by Det Hull.  The
time of arrest was recorded in these words:
<P>

<center>"Apprehended:  06:20 pm 12/04/96"</center>
<P>


<P>

40  	Counsel for Mr Patsalis submitted that this document provided
powerful corroboration for Mr Patsalis' perception that he was
under arrest
virtually from the moment he presented at the police station (ie, 6.20 pm).
<P>

41  	However, Det Hull did not arrive at the Bankstown Police Station
until 8.30 pm.  His knowledge of the time of apprehension
was derived from
conversations with others, or inference.  For the reasons I have given, I
believe that Mr Patsalis was "apprehended",
or arrested, some time after 6.20
pm.  It is not necessary to determine precisely when the police at Bankstown
had sufficient information
to establish Mr Patsalis had committed a crime, or
was not free to leave.  I am satisfied that it was some time after the notes
had
been provided to the police by Mr Patsalis.  There was, accordingly, no
occasion to warn Mr Patsalis.  It follows that there was
no impropriety.
<P>

<b>The Provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a></b>
<P>

42  	My attention has been drawn to s356B of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>, which
was introduced by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/index.html#p10a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 10A</a>, which came into force on 9 February 1998.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/index.html#p10a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 10A</a>
applies to a person under arrest by a police officer for an offence (s356).  Mr
Patsalis was not, at the relevant time (the time
at which the notes were handed
over) under arrest, or subject to the constraints envisaged by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">s139(5).</a>
<P>

43  	Mr Patsalis also relied upon s424A which renders an admission
made by an accused inadmissible unless certain safeguards are
observed (tape
recording, videoing, etc).  Section 424A(4) defines an admission in these
terms:
<P>

"(4)  In this section:
<P>

<b>admission</b> means an admission:
<P>

(a)  that was made by a defendant who, at the time when the admission was made,
was, or ought reasonably to have been, suspected
by an investigation official
of having committed an offence, and ..."
<P>

44  	Assuming the document of Mr Patsalis is an admission for the
purposes of the section, it was not an admission made at a time
when the
investigating police suspected Mr Patsalis of having committed an offence.  For
the reasons given, I do not believe that
it is reasonable to suppose that the
police at that time, on the information they had, ought reasonably to have
suspected Mr Patsalis
of having committed an offence.
<P>

<b>Determination</b>
<P>

45  	I therefore do not believe that Mr Patsalis has been able to
point to any impropriety on the part of the police at the time
the statement
was handed over.  There was no occasion for a warning.  It is therefore
unnecessary for me to undertake the balancing
of competing interests
contemplated by the concluding words of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s138.html" class="autolink_findacts">s138(1).</a>  Subject to the remaining
argument (which will be dealt with in <b><i>R v Patsalis &amp; Spathis [No
4]</i></b>), the document should be admitted.
