MONDAY 7 JUNE 1999
<P>

<b>3748/89	KATHERINE WENTWORTH  v  WENTWORTH:  ESTATE OF GEORGE NEVILLE
WENTWORTH</b>
<P>

<b><u>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	There is before the court an application to reopen
proceedings which were the subject of a judgment by Santow J of 9 April
1999
(the costs proceedings) which followed upon his judgment of 6 February 1998
(the bias proceedings) in which Katherine Wentworth
was the plaintiff.
<P>

2   	In the bias proceedings, Santow J found that in the
taxation of costs in proceedings in which Ms Wentworth was a party, the
taxing
officer, B R Howe (Howe), had acted in a way that gave rise to a reasonable
apprehension of a possibility of bias on the part
of Ms Wentworth, as a result
of which his Honour published draft orders which were in the following
terms:
<P>

"1.	Subject to order 2, the determinations of Taxing Officer Howe made in the
taxation of the Plaintiff's Bill of Costs filed 21
February 1992, including the
reconsideration of the taxation and any costs orders made in relation to the
taxation, be set aside.
<P>

2.	The Interim Certificates issued by Taxing Officer Howe on the dates listed
below, to the extent they cover the amounts paid thereunder
by the Defendant to
the Plaintiff, are not set aside but declared severable from the rest of the
taxation." 
<P>

3   	In the costs proceedings, Ms Wentworth sought orders for
costs which included an order against Howe in relation to whom the
finding was
made by Santow J in the bias proceedings.  The principles upon which Santow J
acted are to be found at page 15 of the
judgment in which reference is made to
<b>Sirros </b>and<b> Rajski</b>.
<P>

4   	In applying those principles, His Honour concluded as
follows:
<P>

"My judgment of 6 February 1998 has no finding of any deliberate contravention
of the rules of natural justice. There is likewise
no finding that the taxing
officer deliberately acted beyond power.  There is furthermore no finding of
actual bias but only a reasonable
apprehension of the possibility of bias.
Thus any analogy based upon the tort of misfeasance in public office to justify
a cost order
against Deputy Registrar Howe would not be justified, even were
there no immunity.  And as I have earlier concluded, there is immunity.
<P>

I am satisfied that the findings made in my judgment of 6 February 1998 are not
such as to justify any order for costs against Deputy
Registrar Howe whether
review costs or, to the extent capable of being made, any non-review costs.  No
order  for costs could in
any event be made in relation either to the Court of
Appeal or contrary to its determination.  That conclusion follows whether the
level of protection of his derivative immunity is taken to be that applicable
to an officer of a superior court or an inferior court
such as a magistrate at
common law, though the former is considered the appropriate level."
<P>

5   	In reaching that conclusion, I note his Honour's reference
to what he described as "an alternative approach to ascertaining
the level of
immunity" in the case before him.  It was expressed in the following way: 
<P>

"An alternative approach to ascertaining the level of immunity in a derivative
context lies in identifying the public interest or
basis of principle
underpinning judicial immunity and then asking:  what level of immunity is
necessary to serve that interest or
basis of principle in the context in which
the question of immunity arises.  That interest or basis of principle has been
expressed
in the following ways: 
<P>

(i)   "to preserve the integrity, independence and resolve of the judiciary,
and to ensure that justice may be administered by such
judges in the courts,
independently and on the basis of their unbiased opinion - not influenced by
any apprehension of personal consequences";<b> </b><i>Rajski v Powell </i>per
Kirby P at 528.
<P>

(ii)   to give "effect to the particular public interest in securing the utmost
freedom to those who preside over judicial proceedings,
subject only to the
constitutional or other remedies for removal from office." <b> </b><i>Mann v
O'Neill </i>per Gummow J at 239-240.
<P>

(iii)   permitting civil liability attaching to persons involved in civil
proceedings "would impede enquiry as the truth and justice
of the matter and
jeopardise the 'safe administration of justice'":  <i>Mann v O'Neill </i>per
Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron JJ at 213; whilst the overriding
consideration in respect of whether or not an absolute privilege
against
defamation will attach is 'whether there will emerge from the proceedings a
determination the truth and justice of which
is a matter of public concern"<b>
</b>(<i>Mann v O'Neill </i>at 212 citing <i>Lincoln v Daniels </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1962%5d%201%20QB%20237" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1962] 1 QB
237</a> per Devlin LJ at 255-256).
<P>

(iv)   to prevent harassment of judicial officers by vexatious litigation by
litigants not able to accept the finality of decisions
against them: <b>
</b><i>McC </i>at 916; <i>Rawlinson v Rice </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%201%20NZLR%20454" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 1 NZLR 454</a> at 464"
<P>

6   	In relation to the present application before Santow J, by
which Ms Wentworth seeks to re-argue the costs proceedings, two
subpoenae have
been issued on her behalf, directed, respectively, to the Director General of
the Department of the Attorney General
of New South Wales and to the Crown
Solicitor, seeking the same material, namely:
<P>

"<b>1.	</b>Letter to Mr Bruce Howe, Deputy Registrar, on or about  27 April
1999 seeking his comments on complaints particularised in document
as provided
to him by the State Crown Solicitor on or about 27 April 1999.
<P>

<b>2.</b>	Letter of response by Mr Bruce Howe, Deputy Registrar, setting out
his comments on the complaints referred to in the letter of 27
April 1999 as
particularised, received by the Crown Solicitor in the first or second week of
May 1999, on or about 12 May 1999"
<P>

7   	Written submissions have been presented on behalf of the
Crown and Ms Wentworth has presented oral submissions, which boil
down to the
proposition that the documents so subpoenaed are relevant (in the sense that
that term is used in discoverability and
inspection of documents under the
Supreme Court Rules) in relation to two issues she seeks to raise before Santow
J, namely:
<P>

(1)	that his Honour had no due regard to the bad faith element in considering
the immunity question in refusing the order for costs
against the taxing
officer; and
<P>

(2)	that his Honour's determination, which, in substance, invalidated the
taxation proceeding that had proceeded thus far, except
for some interim
certificates, should be reviewed to consider what Ms Wentworth has referred to
as the flow-on effect in relation
to the outstanding costs issues between her
and the other relevant parties in the principal proceeding.
<P>

8   	Objection is taken on behalf of the Crown to the inspection
of these documents, essentially on the ground of relevance, and
the parties are
agreed, firstly, that I should read the documents so produced on subpoena and,
second, determine the question of
relevance in the context of the issues I have
just described.  I have done that.
<P>

9   	I have read the material quite carefully and I am satisfied
that the material is not relevant, in the sense in which I have
used the term,
so as to make it inappropriate that the documents should be made available for
inspection by Ms Wentworth.
<P>

10   	In the circumstances, as it is not intended that I should
take any further part in the proceedings that are currently before
Santow J,
the course I will follow is to publish these reasons, to place the documents
subpoenaed into the envelope from which they
have come, to seal that envelope
and direct that it remain with the subpoena until further order.
<P>

11   	In dismissing the application to inspect the documents, I
do not propose to make any order as to the costs of this application.
 Rather,
I think the appropriate course is to reserve the question of costs so that the
costs involved in this aspect of the proceedings
can be dealt with at the one
time by the presiding judge, presumably Santow J.

<b>WEDNESDAY 9 June 1999 </b>
<P>

<b>ADDENDUM TO ORDER OF 7 JUNE 1999 </b>
<P>

12   	Since making the order refusing Ms Wentworth's application
to inspect the documents the subject of subpoenas issued at her
instance to the
Director-General of the Department of the Attorney-General of New South Wales
and to the Crown Solicitor, Santow
J has referred to me submissions in writing
received by him from Ms Wentworth by facsimile on 8 June 1999 in which, among
other things,
the following submissions were made:
<P>

"12.	The plaintif (sic) therefore seeks a reopening upon the question of the
relevance of the documents which the Crown contended,
because they went only to
the conduct of Mr. Howe, that they were not relevant to the matters currently
before the Court.
<P>

13.	The plaintiff submits in the terms of the Court of Appeal judgement, that
the judgement of 9/4/99 must be set aside, that the
whole issue must be looked
at afresh, because this Court must be bound by the terms of this
determination.
<P>

14.	The plaintiff submits that she is unable to make full submissions in
respect of the costs aspects until the documents sought
on subpoena are
assessed by her.
<P>

15.	The plaintiff seeks that the Court re-determine the relevance of the
documents produced on subpoena, in the light of the determination
of the Court
of Appeal judgement of 31 May 1999, and seeks a proper oral hearing in respect
of that matter.
<P>

16.	As advised the plaintiff is on leave from to-morrow morning and will not be
available for four weeks to attend Court.  Accordingly
the Plaintiff seeks an
order that any orders consequent upon the delivery of the judgement of Justice
Hunter of 7/6/99 not be entered,
and that leave be granted for thoat (sic)
determination to be reconsidered in the light of AG v Kennedy Miller 31/5/99 as
to its
effect upon the relevance of the documents produced by the Crown law
officers."
<P>

13   	Upon being so informed, I caused my associate to
communicate with Ms Wentworth by facsimile of 8 June 1999 in the following
terms:
<P>

"Dear Ms Wentworth,
<P>

Justice Hunter has requested me to inform you that he has been provided with
your request for a re-determination of the relevance
of the documents produced
on subpoena.  As you are proposing to leave on a four week holiday tomorrow,
his Honour will hear the application
at 4pm this afternoon in Court 11B.
Otherwise it will be necessary for you to postpone your departure to enable the
hearing to take
place later this week at a time suitable to you.  His Honour
will be unavailable in July, August and September to deal with the matter
if
you were to depart tomorrow without having this matter determined.  His Honour
has asked me to emphasise that this proposed further
hearing should not be
regarded as his acceptance of any entitlement to be heard orally as requested
by you.  Please respond by return
to me on 9230 8740."
<P>

14   	Since forwarding the facsimile I have received no further
communication from her.  In the circumstances outlined in my associate's
facsimile, I do not propose to accede to the request in the submissions of Ms
Wentworth quoted above for the following reasons:
<P>

(a)	Without recourse to the decision of the court of Appeal referred to in Ms
Wentworth's submissions, having inspected the subpoenaed
documents, there is no
reason why my determination as to relevance should be re-examined.  They
contain no "material which could,
rationally, affect the assessment of the
probability of the existence of "misconduct" on the part of Howe as asserted by
Ms Wentworth.
<P>

(b)	Having considered that Court of Appeal decision, I am completely satisfied
that there is nothing in that judgment that would
provide a basis for an
arguable case for the reconsideration of that question of relevance.  For that
purpose I accept the unsworn
statement of Ms Wentworth that she had no
knowledge of the Court of Appeal's decision at the time of my determination.
<P>

(c)	I noted in my reasons for refusing inspection of the documents of 7 June
1999, the findings of Santow J in his Honour's judgment
of 9 April 1999 that no
finding of any deliberate contravention of the rules of natural justice had
been committed by the taxing
officer:  that there was no finding that the
taxing officer deliberately acted beyond power and that there was no finding of
actual
bias on the part of the taxing officer.  
<P>

15   	I consider that in those circumstances to further indulge
Ms Wentworth by appointing a hearing in some four month's time to
receive oral
submissions in further support of her request to reconsider the question of
relevance the subject of my reasons of 7
June 1999 is totally unjustified and a
thorough waste of public resources.  The course I propose to follow is to
communicate this
addendum to Santow J and to Ms Wentworth, by facsimile in the
latter case.
