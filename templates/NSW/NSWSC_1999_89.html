<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>  The first defendant is a vehicle for a joint venture
between the first plaintiff as to 70%, Mr Lim the second plaintiff as to 10%
and the second defendant Mr Tee as to 20%.  The first defendant has invested in
16 residential units and 10 shop units in a strata
development known as "The
Goldsbrough" at Darling Harbour at a total cost of about 7 million dollars.
<P>

2	The first plaintiff is a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands
on 5 May 1997.  Its board meets in St Helier Jersey.
 Although he is neither a
director nor a shareholder of the first plaintiff, Mr Jerry Chan, the first
cross defendant, is in a position
where he can control the first plaintiff.  Mr
Jerry Chan is a resident of Malaysia.
<P>

3	The third defendant, Ms Wendy Tee, who is the sister of the second defendant,
has at all material times managed the investment
at Darling Harbour.
<P>

4	When the statement of claim was filed, there were a series of disputes
between the parties.  Many of those have now been solved.
 Thus at the
beginning of the hearing on 10 December last I was able to make orders 29(iia)
to (iiic) inclusive and 29(ivb) in the
amended statement of claim without
opposition.  This then left 9 matters for decision as follows:
<P>

(1)	Were 6 shares validly allotted in August 1997 to Mr Lim, Mr Tee and Ms
Tee?
<P>

(2)	If the answer to question 1 is "No", should an order be made under s 254E
of the Corporations Law validating the allotment?
<P>

(3)	In respect of the $85,000 allegedly received by Mr  Lim from Mr Tee -
<P>

(a)	Was that sum received for on-payment to Mr Chan; or 
<P>

(b)	Was it the proceeds of a lottery win?
<P>

If the former, is there a breach of a Quistclose trust?
<P>

(4)	Was the first plaintiff the relevant party to the agreement or was it Mr
Chan?
<P>

(5)	Was it a term of the agreement that Mr Chan undertook to indemnify the
first defendant for 70% of any monies that the other
joint venturers may have
to pay Citibank?
<P>

(6)	Was there an implied term that Mr Chan or the first plaintiff had an
obligation to provide funds for the first defendant proportionately
to his
stake in the joint venture?
<P>

(7)	Are the Tees able to restrain the first plaintiff or Mr Chan removing them
as directors?
<P>

(8)	Did the Tees' contribution to the joint venture result in a debt owing to
them?
<P>

(9)	What is the result of this case?
<P>

5	I will deal with these matters seriatim referring to the relevant facts under
each head.
<P>

6	(1)	I was surprised to see that this question was vigorously debated because
were it not for the ingenuity of counsel for the
defendants I would have
thought it was virtually unarguable.  
<P>

7	The Articles of Association of the first defendant place the shares under the
control of the directors (vide article 2.1.2). 
The Articles provide for the
directors to meet and for a director at any time to convene a meeting of
directors.  Article 15.1.1
provides that "The directors may meet together by
electronic means or otherwise for the dispatch of business and adjourn and
otherwise
regulate their meetings as they think fit."  Article 15.5 provides
that a quorum shall be two.  Article 15.9.1 provides for circular
resolutions.
There is no particular article in the Articles of Association dispensing with
notice to directors or permitting meetings
without directors being present or
without directors being notified of the meeting.
<P>

8	Mr Wood's submissions for the plaintiffs were very simple.  He put that
unless the Articles or the Corporations Law provide otherwise,
all directors
have the right to attend board meetings and participate and a meeting cannot be
held without notice being given to
the directors.  Moreover, unless the
Articles otherwise provide, the fact that a director is overseas does not by
itself mean that
notice need not be given to that director:  <b><i>Mitropoulos
v Greek Orthodox Church and Community of Marrickville &amp; District Ltd
</i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2010%20ACSR%20134" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 10 ACSR 134</a>, 137.  Although the prerequisites of a valid meeting
of directors will differ from company to company and will be influenced by
circumstances,
as Tadgell, J said in <b><i>Bell v Burton </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2012%20ACSR%20325" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 12 ACSR
325</a>, 329, "one ineluctable prerequisite ... for a valid meeting is reasonable
notice, to those entitled to attend, that a meeting will
be held, and an
indication of when and where or how it will be held."
<P>

9	Mr Ryan for the defendants, sought to outflank these submissions by focusing
on the joint venture agreement between the parties
and subsequent discussions
between them in which the defendants say it was agreed that shares would be
issued as were issued on 7
August 1998.  They say that even if there was a
defect in the meeting the issue was in accordance with the agreement and that
the
plaintiffs cannot complain.
<P>

10	This argument must be rejected.  It may be that by the appropriate steps and
proceedings in court the issue of shares in accordance
with the agreement could
be enforced, but one cannot simply avoid those necessary steps by purporting to
hold a meeting of directors
and for the company to issue shares without any
authority.  Accordingly, the answer to this question must be that the shares
were
not validly issued.
<P>

11	(2)	The answer to question (1) raises the question as to whether the court
should validate the improper issue of shares under
s 254E of the Corporations
Law.  
<P>

12	Section 254E empowers the court "on application by a company, a shareholder,
a creditor or any other person whose interests have
been or may be affected,
... (to) make an order validating, or confirming the terms of, a purported
issue of shares ...".  The section
is a recasting of what before July 1998 was
s 194 of the Law.
<P>

13	It is clear that the court's power under this section is very wide.  In
<b><i>Wallington v Kokotovich Constructions Pty Ltd </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2011%20ACSR%20759" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 11 ACSR 759</a>,
765, I said of the former section, "The court has power whenever it is just and
equitable to validate the issue of shares not only
where the validation is
non-contentious.  Indeed the main thrust of s 194 is to validate defective
titles where there has been a
bona fide transaction involving the issue of
shares which is flawed for some technical reason ...".  This decision was
affirmed by
the Court of Appeal in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1995/54.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] NSWSC 54</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2017%20ACSR%20478" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 17 ACSR 478.</a>
<P>

14	Although the discretion is very wide, there is a tendency not to exercise it
in favour of validation where less than all the
stakeholders have a chance to
participate in the decision to issue the shares:  <b><i>Moran v Moranco
Enterprises Pty Ltd </i></b>(1996) 22 ACSR 65.
<P>

15	Mr Wood's submissions are that the entirety of the events surrounding the
impugned allotment must be considered in the exercise
of the discretion and
whilst legitimate expectations of innocent allottees should be taken into
account, this does not extend to
"illegitimate expectations of non-innocent
allottees".  He cites <b><i>Re Monitronix Ltd </i></b>(1987) 12 ACLR 161, 175-6
and <b><i>Moran's case </i></b>at pp 68 and 70.  I think, with respect, that
submission goes a little too far.  All Kennedy, J did in the <b><i>Monitronix
case </i></b>was to make it clear that he was not persuaded that he should
exercise his discretion in favour of promoters who had shown a consistent
course of blatant disregard of their obligations including filing returns for
the authorities which were patently false (p 176).
 However, the flavour of Mr
Wood's submission certainly is a strong reason why the court might not exercise
its discretion in the
instant case because there was no mere inadvertent act
but a deliberate abandonment of any attempt to comply with the Corporations
Law
in order to give the similitude of <b><i> </i></b>regularity to an allotment
which may well not have taken place had Mr Chan or his representative been told
about it.  That this is
so is evident by the fact that these proceedings were
commenced shortly afterwards.  
<P>

16	I do not consider that this is a proper case for exercise of the power under
s 254E of the Law.  The acts sought to be validated
were deliberate acts which
would, if not challenged, have put the Tees in a far superior position and when
those acts are challenged
I cannot see any substantial reason for validating
them so that the Tees can retain that advantage.
<P>

17	(3)	The background facts of the claim of the Tees may be found in paragraphs
28 and 29 of Mr Tee's affidavit.  He says that on
21 March 1998 he saw off Mr
Lim who was flying out to Sydney.  He said he handed Mr Lim 1,200 ringgit and
60 Australian dollars in
three cheques made out to Mr Tee by NSW Lotteries.  At
the then conversion rate this was about $500.  He asked Mr Lim to buy 50
tickets
of Lucky Seven and said that if Mr Lim topped up this sum by another
$500 Australian then the two would share the winnings 50/50.
 Mr Lim said that
this was a bit too much but he might put in 20% and Mr Tee said that if that
happened then he would get a 20% share
of the profits.  Mr Lim returned to
Kuala Lumpur on 27 March 1998 and said that the exchange rate was not as good
as Mr Tee had anticipated
and that he did buy 60 tickets.  One of the tickets
won $1 million Australian.  Mr Tee says that he later ascertained that Mr Lim
had only bought 46 tickets and had only put in $10 or $20 of his own money.
There was a discussion as to what, if anything, Mr Lim
was entitled to out of
the proceeds and there was an agreement, according to Mr Tee, that Mr Lim would
receive $100,000.  Mr Tee
says he said to Mr Lim, "As you know, I still owe
Jerry (Chan) about $80,000, maybe $85,000 with interest.  I will give you a
cheque
for $A185,000.   Please pay the balance of $85,000 to Jerry so that I
can clear my account with him."  Mr Lim said "Consider it done."
 Mr Tee in
fact gave Mr Lim a cheque for $185,000 on 21 April 1998.
<P>

18	Mr Lim says that indeed one of the tickets did win a million dollars but
that he spent $400 of Mr Tee's money and $100 of his
own money to buy the
tickets.  Mr Lim says he told Mr Tee of the win and the following weekend went
with his wife to Mr Tee's house
to bring him the lottery tickets.  Mr Tee and
his wife were both present.  Mr Tee gave Mr Lim a cheque for $A185,000 saying
that
he had deducted $15,000 to cover gifts and tips he made to various people
who assisted in the formation of ML &amp; C, including
Wendy Tee.  He also said
he needed to tip the girls who printed out the winning numbers at the
newsagent.  Mr Lim says he did not
say anything because he was so happy to have
a return of $185,000 from an investment of $100.  Mr Lim denies that there was
any agreement
that he would pay $85,000 of his lottery winnings to Mr Chan in
consideration for the allotment of shares in ML &amp; C.  He says
that at the
time of the lottery win it was his understanding that Mr Tee had paid for Mr
Lim's shares in ML &amp; C.
<P>

19	Mr Lim says that Mr Tee collected his winnings by a telegraphic transfer to
his Australian Citibank account from NSW Lotteries.
 Mr Tee and Mr Lim then
came to Australia to have a little celebration and Mr Tee helped him open a
bank account for his share of
the winnings.  This account was opened at  the
Martin Place branch of Citibank through Mr Tee's personal banker, Ms Albine
Martin.
<P>

20	The Citibank documents show that on 20 April 1998 Mr Lim opened two
accounts, one a cheque account in which there was a deposit
of $35,000 and
secondly an investment account in which $150,000 was deposited.  In oral
evidence Mr Lim said that Mr Tee was sitting
right beside him when he was
opening the accounts with Ms Martin.  In cross examination Mr Tee did not deny
that he was sitting next
to Mr Lim when the accounts were opened but says he
did not pay any attention to what Mr Lim was saying to Ms Martin.
<P>

21	Mr Tee also agreed with Mr Wood in cross examination that there had been
five occasions between August 1997 and February 1998
where there was
conversation between Mr Chan and Mr Tee about paying Mr Chan the $85,000.  Mr
Wood put it to Mr Tee that "It would
be patently absurd for you to give a
cheque to Mr Lim to pay Mr Chan the balance when you had five direct contacts
with him previously,
wouldn't you agree?"  A.  "No I did not speak to Mr Chan
after March of 1998... and I did not give the cheque to Mr Lim until April
of
1998."  Mr Tee was then challenged about his story that Mr Lim couldn't afford
to put in $100 to the lottery quest when he was
just flying to Australia from
Malaysia with his wife at a cost vastly in excess of $100.  Mr Wood put it to
Mr Tee that it was absurd
to suggest that he couldn't afford $100 for lottery
tickets, a man who was an investment analyst and a stockbroker who travelled
often.  Mr Wood put that Mr Tee's story was a pure invention to avoid paying
anything to Mr Chan.  Mr Tee, of course, denied this
and said that Mr Chan had
so insulted him that he did not wish to talk to him directly.
<P>

22	Both Mr Tee and Mr Lim were cross examined by experienced counsel.  Mr Lim
did not seem to me to waiver at all in cross examination.
 On the other hand, I
found Mr Tee's evidence a little hard to accept.  My observation was that he
was a witness who tried not to
answer the questions.  Furthermore the evidence
suggests to me that at least some of the documents Mr Tee created must have
been
backdated.   When I add these impressions to the inherent unlikelihood of
Mr Tee's evidence being correct (particularly in respect
of Mr Lim's inability
to pay $100 for lottery tickets and Mr Tee's non-observance of Mr Lim opening
two bank accounts) I must reject
Mr Tee's account.   Accordingly, I find that
the $85,000 was paid by Mr Tee to Mr Lim as part of the proceeds of the lottery
win.
 
<P>

23	(4)	Was it Foundation Enterprises Limited or Mr Chan personally who was the
relevant party to the joint venture agreement?
<P>

24	The plaintiffs say that the relevant agreement was concluded by Mr Chan on
behalf of the first plaintiff with Mr Lim and Mr Tee
the agreement being partly
written, partly oral and partly implied.  The plaintiffs say that on 10 May
1997 Messrs Tee, Lim and Chan
met together in Mr Chan's office in Penang.  Mr
Tee proposed that there should be a joint venture in which Mr Lim and Mr Tee
collectively
contributed 30% and Mr Chan 70% and that profits should be divided
proportionately.  The parties settled on 10% for Mr Lim, 20% for
Mr Tee and 70%
for Mr Chan.  Mr Chan agreed to arrange the necessary capital on the basis that
the others could pay him back in one
or two months.  The parties agreed that
there would be a shelf company and that Messrs Tee and Lim and either Mr Chan
or his company
would be entitled to hold shares in proportion to their capital
contributions and that Messrs Tee and Lim and Ms Tee would be directors.
 The
property was acquired at a cost of just under 7 million Australian dollars of
which 2 million dollars was supplied by the first
plaintiff, Foundation
Enterprises Limited, and the balance from a loan from Citibank.  
<P>

25	The plaintiffs say that in pursuance of this agreement 12 shares were
allotted to Foundation Enterprises Limited on 29 May 1997.
<P>

26	In their defence, the Tees admit that Foundation Enterprises Limited
acquired those 12 shares and that such acquisition took
place pursuant to the
joint venture agreement but say that it merely acted as an agent for Mr Chan.
They say that the agreement was
that although  Mr Chan was to remain anonymous
he would be entitled to 70% of the joint venture company, with Mr Tee receiving
20%
and Mr Lim 10%.  They say that Mr Chan's interest and his shareholding
would be held on his behalf by Foundation Enterprises Limited.
 They say that
Mr Chan was not to be a director to preserve his anonymity, that the directors
of the joint venture company would
be Messrs Lim and Tee and Ms Tee.  They
would provide personal guarantees to Citibank and they would be indemnified by
Mr Chan to
the extent of 70% of that liability.  Ms Tee would act as general
manager and would have an option over 5% of the company's equity
and that all
shareholders would make further proportionate contributions of funds to ML
&amp; C Heritage Pty Limited if required.
 They say that the written part of
the agreement was a letter of 18 September 1997 from Mr Tee, Ms Tee and Mr Lim
to Mr Chan.
<P>

27	Mr Tee was cross examined as to his knowledge of the name Foundation
Enterprises Limited.  He agreed that he knew the name of
the company by the end
of May 1997.  He acknowledged he knew Mr Chan was proposing to use an off-shore
company for his investment
in this project.  It was no surprise that Foundation
Enterprises Limited was a British Virgin Islands company.  It was then put to
Mr Tee:  "You knew that Mr Chan was not proposing to enter into an arrangement
himself personally but was going into it using an
off-shore company as a
vehicle to enter the arrangement?"   
<P>

28	Mr Tee's answer was, "I knew the off shore company was going to be used as a
personal investment for ML &amp; C.  I might add,
he wanted to remain anonymous
in this investment."  The extra piece of evidence that Mr Tee added was not
very useful to him.  Of
course it repeated what he had said in his defence but
it is quite improbable that Mr Chan would be wholly anonymous when he had
personally corresponded with officers of Citibank, especially relating to his
personal guarantee and that he had come out to Perth
to negotiate a deal with a
company called "Jaguar" and had met the heads of Jaguar in Perth.
<P>

29	I just cannot accept that there was use of Foundation Enterprises Limited
merely to keep Mr Chan's name from exposure.  The facts
show this could not be
so.  There was no other reason proffered for someone going to all the trouble
of using a British Virgin Island
company for this investment.  The only logical
reason was to safeguard Mr Chan's interests by having a company in which he
controlled
the joint venture partner.  
<P>

30	Accordingly, in my view the joint venture partner was Foundation Enterprises
Limited and not Mr Chan personally.
<P>

31	(5)	Was it a term of the agreement that Mr Chan undertook to indemnify the
first defendant for 70% of any sum that it may have
to pay Citibank?
<P>

32	It follows from what I have already said that the answer to this question
must be "No" so far as Mr Chan personally is concerned,
but it may be that
there is such an indemnity due from the first plaintiff so I will need to
explore this matter in detail.
<P>

33	The first thing to note is that the contract was made in Malaysia between
natural persons resident there and Foundation Enterprises
Limited which,
although a British Virgin Islands corporation, was in fact controlled by a
Malaysian resident.  Accordingly it would
appear fairly clear that Malaysian
law applies.  There is no evidence as to what the Malaysian law is in this
respect so I am entitled
to assume that it is the same as the law of New South
Wales.
<P>

34	The Tees' case on this matter stems from an oral agreement allegedly made
over lunch in Kuala Lumpur in August 1997 confirmed
by Mr Tee's letter of 18
September 1997 to which I have already referred.  Mr Tee says that at the lunch
at which Mr Chan, Mr Lim,
Ms Tee and himself were present, it was reported that
the purchase had been completed but it was touch and go because Citibank nearly
didn't commit.  Mr Tee then said to Mr Chan, "Jerry, on the subject of the
Citibank guarantee, would you agree that you should indemnify
us for your 70%
share?" to which Mr Chan said "Yes, I have no problems with that."  There was
then discussion about pooling various
other loans and Mr Tee said that he had
given his irrevocable transfer in trust to Wendy Tee in respect of his own
apartment, Unit
642.  He said the net worth of that unit was $185,500.  There
was then a discussion as to whether Wendy Tee would be paid a salary
and a
compromise was reached that Wendy would have an option to participate in 5% of
the investment and that Mr Chan's interest would
be reduced to 66.5% and that
the interests of Messrs Lim and Tee would be reduced 1.5%.
<P>

35	Mr Chan agrees that there was a lunch at a restaurant in Kuala Lumpur in
August 1997.  He agrees that the question of Wendy Tee's
salary was raised by
her brother.  Mr Chan says the agreement was that Wendy Tee could live in one
of the units free of charge and
would be reimbursed for legitimate expenses but
otherwise would not receive any remuneration.  He says that it was agreed that
Ms
Tee would give regular monthly written reports.  She did not do this, though
Mr Tee did ring up from time to time to say that all
was going well.
<P>

36	Mr Chan agreed that Mr Tee sent the letter of 18 September though he does
not know of any "transfer in trust" that was actually
executed and mentioned in
the letter, nor was there a cheque for $80,103 attached.  He says he did not
respond to that letter because
he realised that Mr Tee was not as financially
secure as he had been led to believe. The cheque was not attached and the
letter contained
erroneous calculations assessing Foundation Enterprises
Limited's contribution at only $885,344 when in fact it had been over 2 million
dollars.
<P>

37	Under cross examination from Mr Ryan, Mr Chan denied that the question of
indemnifying the directors in relation to their guarantee
to Citibank was ever
raised at the lunch in August 1997.  He said he was absolutely sure of this.
Mr Ryan put that it was incredible
that the directors with a 30% interest in
the venture would have to guarantee 5 million dollars without any recourse to
Mr Chan or
Foundation Enterprises Limited.  Mr Chan's response was "When FEL
came up with 2 million what did FEL have.  It didn't have control
of a bank
account, it wasn't involved in signing cheques, it didn't have sight of any
records, it didn't have any actuarial matters
in its hands and yet FEL gave the
money;  it was all based on trust."
<P>

38	Mr Lim was asked by Mr Ryan whether there was any mention of the indemnity
at the lunch in Malaysia.  He said (p T44) "I can't
remember this was a
detailed discussion.  Maybe something about it but I remember later on Mr Tee
give me a letter after lunch that
letter is 18 September letter, asking me to
sign that letter and pointing out to me `Choon you are to sign this because the
lunch
is finished and I have to rush for another appointment and you have to
sign.  Choon you have 10% share, if you have to be responsible
for 70% you
have, you will be indemnified.'"  He was then asked "You are happy to sign
because you knew it had been agreed in August
that that would be the position?"
             A.  "No I sign because it was in my interest to sign it."   He
then, however, agreed
that he would not have signed it if he believed it was
false.
<P>

39	Usually when a person sends to another person a letter containing details of
an alleged agreement and that other person does
not respond, then if the
relation between the parties is such that a reply might properly be expected
but not otherwise, the law
may infer that there has been an admission by
silence of the truth in the letter:  <b><i>Shaddock &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v
Parramatta City Council (No 1) </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/59.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 59</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20150%20CLR%20225" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 150 CLR 225</a>, 230;  <b><i>Thomas v
Hollier </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20156%20CLR%20152" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 156 CLR 152</a>, 157 per Gibbs, CJ.  
<P>

40	In the instant case, the letter of 18 September asked for a signature by Mr
Chan that the contents of the letter were agreed
to.  This signed
acknowledgment was never forthcoming.  In my view because the requested
acknowledgment was never forthcoming, it
is harder to draw the inference that
there was an admission of the contents by silence.  Again, the rather
unconventional dealings
between the parties where so much was being done with
large sums of money informally provides some reason as to why there was not
a
formal response to the letter.  The present problem is not a question of
admissibility of evidence as the letter and the failure
to answer it are before
the court.  However I do not consider that it is strong material from which I
should draw an inference of
admission by silence and I do not do so.
<P>

41	The case made by the defendants was one of actual contract rather than an
implied contract.  I do not, accordingly, need to consider
whether, apart from
the words which were allegedly spoken at the restaurant at Kuala Lumpur, I
should imply any term as to indemnification.
 
<P>

42	At first blush it seems not unreasonable that where there is a joint venture
and a syndicate member expends funds, that member
ought to be indemnified.
However, one must look at the total picture to see whether, in all the
circumstances there was at least
an implied request to expend money on the
basis that there would be an indemnity.  The circumstances here do not amount
to such an
implied request, particularly bearing in mind what I say in the next
paragraph.
<P>

43	The rule adopted in <b><i>Sheffield Corp v Barclay </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1905%5d%20AC%20392" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1905] AC 392</a>,
397 and applied by the High Court in <b><i>Crown v Henrickson </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281911%29%2013%20CLR%2043" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1911) 13
CLR 43</a> is not apposite as there is no request to be implied from the relevant
circumstances.  Further, it would be difficult to say that
such a term fell
within the doctrine of implied terms as laid down by the Privy Council in
<b><i>BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Hastings SC </i></b>(1977) 180 CLR
266, 283. In particular the implied term as to indemnity is not a matter that
would "go without saying".
<P>

44	Another point that must be made is that if there was a cross indemnity from
the plaintiffs, why when a Mr Tan was proposed to
be a director of the company,
did Mr Tee seek Mr Tan to join in the guarantee if there was in place an
indemnity from Mr Chan for
70% of the liability to Citibank?  This was put to
Mr Tee by Mr Wood at T110-111 and although Mr Tee denied it, it does seem to me
again to be inconsistent with the existence of the indemnity.
<P>

45	Again, I should add that I prefer the evidence, generally speaking, of Mr
Chan to that of Mr Tee.  I have already commented on
Mr Tee's evidence.  Mr
Chan was not at all disturbed in cross examination despite being cross examined
by an expert in the field.
<P>

46	I said earlier that one of the reasons why I am wary about accepting Mr
Tee's evidence is because some of the letters he wrote
were not despatched on
the date which appears on the letters, assuming that they were written on such
date.  For instance, the letter
from Mr Tee directed to Ms Wendy Tee of 1
August 1997 saying that he confirmed his irrevocable agreement to "pool" his
apartment
must have been written after 1 August because the address set out on
the letter was not the company's address as at 1 August.  Furthermore,
the
vital letter of 18 September clearly appeared from cross examination to have
been sent later, though how much later was in dispute.
 Mr Tee agreed in the
witness box that that letter was not sent for at least four days, probably
longer.  He said at T90 that he
had written out a cheque for $153,000 to go
with the letter, he had left a lot of money with his father who had died
unexpectedly
without leaving a will so he had restricted access to cash and was
attending to his father's funeral "so the answer to your second
question is
that I did not send the 18 September letter to Mr Chan on the 18th.  I believe
it was sent later, but I can't remember
how much later."  Mr Tee was asked why
it was that when he had a letter written out and signed and all he had to do
was put it in
the post box his father's death prevented that happening.  There
was no satisfactory answer.
<P>

47	The fact that the 18 September letter was not delivered to Mr Chan on or
near the date which it bears, the fact that no money
accompanied that letter
despite its text, and the ongoing discussions between Mr Tee and Mr Chan in
which Mr Tee was asking Mr Chan
for a loan or to defer payments, make me
decline to draw any inference from the fact that there was no response to the
letter of
any admission by Mr Chan of its correctness.
<P>

48	Accordingly, I do not find that there was any agreement as to indemnity.
<P>

49	It should also be remembered, as Mr Wood pointed out in his address, that
the parties never thought as at the time they made
the agreement that there
would be any of the problems with the building that in fact occurred.  It was
perceived by all of them when
the joint venture agreement was made to be a good
investment with no expectation of any of them making any further contributions.
These matters also go to show that there was no agreement on indemnity.   
<P>

50	(6)	The allegation that there was an agreement that all shareholders should
make proportionate contributions is a provision of
the letter of  18 September
which I have already discussed.  However, this provision does not form part of
Mr Tee's evidence as to
what occurred during the discussion at the restaurant
in Kuala Lumpur in August.  The claim based solely on the letter of 18
September
must fail because I am not satisfied that that letter does contain
the terms of any agreement.  Again, this particular term is said
to be an
express term rather than implication from the joint venture agreement generally
so I need not stay to consider any further
aspects of this matter. 
<P>

51	(7)	Mr Ryan's submissions simply are that "clearly Chan/FEL intends to
remove Mr Tee and Ms Tee from the board ...   This would
contravene a term of
the agreement pleaded by the plaintiffs that such persons would be board
members.  Chan/FEL should be restrained
from removing the Tees."
<P>

52	It is clear that the Tees' directorship was a term of the joint venture
agreement.  It is also clear that Mr Chan through FEL
intends to remove the
Tees as directors.  The questions are whether they are entitled to do this and
whether an injunction should
go, conditional or otherwise. 
<P>

53	The term of the contract as pleaded was that Mr Tee would be a director if
and only if his contributions were paid to the joint
venture as promised. 
<P>

54	The application for an injunction is really closely akin to an application
for specific performance of the joint venture agreement.
 The court does not
grant specific performance as a general rule except in the case of a person who
by his or her own conduct is
doing everything possible to perform the agreement
so far as it can be performed on his or her part.  Normally one does not get
specific
performance of part of an agreement, nor is an injunction given which
will have that effect.  I have put these propositions in fairly
general terms
but they are supported by the learning referred to by Dr Spry in the 5th
edition of his <b><i>Principles of Equitable Remedies </i></b>(LBC, Sydney,
1997) pp 113 and 588.  The question is a discretionary one as to whether in the
circumstances the grant of an injunction
would be just. 
<P>

55	I must confess this is a matter that has caused me considerable concern as I
have deliberated.  On the one hand the Tees were
to be involved as directors,
the project was one with which they were intended to be intimately involved and
to control at the grass
roots level and if no injunction is granted they will
be completely removed from the investment.  All that Mr Chan says is that if
Mr
Tee makes his contribution then he will reconsider the matter.  On the other
hand, the Tees' behaviour, claims Mr Chan, is something
which I can well see
would make him lose any confidence in dealing with the Tees in the future.
Moreover, the Tees have sought to
control this large investment to the
exclusion of Mr Chan by unfair means without making a contribution save and
except the debts
they have paid on behalf of the company.  
<P>

56	Again, I must take into account  the fact that the joint venture agreement
as to who is to  be a director must be subject to
some overriding conditions
such as, for instance, that the Tees were not disqualified under the
Corporations Law from being directors.
 Mr Wood submitted that even the cross
claim recognises that the Tees need to act properly as a condition of their
remaining on as
directors:  they have not so acted therefore no court will aid
them.
<P>

57	I am not prepared to grant an injunction at this stage.  However, it may be
that when short minutes are handed up, I would be
prepared to make a
declaration or even an injunction that the Tees have the right to be directors
subject to their giving an undertaking
to the court that they will discharge
their duties fairly and honestly including not convening any directors'
meetings without giving
the plaintiffs at least a certain number of days
notice.
<P>

58	(8)	Finally I need to consider the claim for debt.  There is no doubt at all
on the evidence that the Tees have had to pay out
monies to make sure the
mortgagee has been kept at bay.  
<P>

59	Mr Wood says that no order for debt should be made because there has been no
proper contradictor, the debtor, if any, would be
the first defendant ML &amp;
C which is under the control of the cross claimants.  I think this is right.
In any event, in these
situations where joint ventures go sour, the rule is
that there cannot be part of an account.  The remedy of any joint venturer is
to seek to wind the joint venture up under the control of the court and for
accounts to be taken between the relevant parties.  The
court does not merely
find an amount due in respect of some part of the venture.  Accordingly, I do
not consider that I should make
any order with respect to the "debt".
<P>

60	(9)	It follows that the plaintiffs have been successful.  There should be
declarations in accordance with these reasons and the
defendants should pay the
plaintiffs' costs.  What I will do at this stage is to publish these reasons
and to stand the matter over
until Thursday 11 March 1999  at 9.30 am for short
minutes to be brought in.  Should counsel contact my Associate at least 7 days
before that date, it may be able to be altered to suit their convenience.
