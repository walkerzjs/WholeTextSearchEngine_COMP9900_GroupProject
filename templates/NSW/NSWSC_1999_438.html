Wednesday 12 May 1999
<P>

<b>4354 of 1996 NORMA McKONE v ALFREDO MARETTA</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER MACREADY:</b>  This is an application under the <b>Defacto
Relationships Act</b> for the adjustment of the parties' property interests.
According to the plaintiff the parties lived together in a defacto relationship
for a number of periods between late 1984 and the middle of 1995.  The parties
have no children of the relationship although each
party had children from a
marriage.  There is a substantial dispute between the parties as to whether or
not a defacto relationship
did exist at any stage.  There is also a substantial
dispute as to whether or not there have been any financial contributions by
the
plaintiff.
<P>

2	It is useful to first set out the parties' contentions in relation to the
existence of the defacto relationship in order to put
into context the
chronology of events which becomes important in the matter.  
<P>

	<b>The Plaintiff's version of the relationship.</b>
<P>

3	For the plaintiff's part she says that in late 1984 she was residing in
rented accommodation at 17A Clissold Street, Ashfield.
 She had previously met
the defendant when she went to work for him in his business.  At all relevant
times during the period in
question up until late 1995 the plaintiff did work
in a clerical capacity for the defendant in his business.  There are disputes
about payment of wages for some of the period.  The plaintiff, who appeared to
be the defendant's bookkeeper, had duties which included
maintaining wage and
other financial records.  It was September 1976 when she commenced this work.

<P>

4	The plaintiff suggests that at some time prior to late 1984 they started
seeing each other socially at which time a sexual relationship
commenced.
Towards the latter part of 1984 the plaintiff was living with her daughter,
Melanie, at Clissold Street.  Melanie was
then engaged to be married in
December of that year.  According to the plaintiff the defendant moved in to
live with her at Clissold
Street after Melanie left the home upon her marriage.
She says that he continued to reside there until September 1986 when the
parties
had an argument about his children.  According to the plaintiff he then
moved to the factory premises at Arthur Street, Leichhardt
where he carried on
his business.  The defendant, according to her, and he concedes this, modified
those premises to provide for
some minor living accommodation so he could live
in those premises.  
<P>

5	In December 1986 the plaintiff purchased a flat at 4/15 Nagle Street,
Liverpool.  The purchase price was $41,000 of which $11,000
was paid by the
plaintiff in cash and the balance was borrowed.  The plaintiff concedes that
after its purchase she moved all her
furniture into the unit and commenced to
live there.  She says that in March or April 1987 she moved to the factory and
started to
live with the defendant at his premises in the factory.  According
to the plaintiff it was more convenient and saved her travelling.
 She still
maintained the property at Liverpool which was not let.  
<P>

6	In December 1990 the plaintiff exchanged contracts for the sale of the
property at Liverpool which sale was settled in February
1991.  The proceeds
she retained and placed in an account in her own name.  At the end of 1990 she
moved with the defendant to his
former matrimonial home at Haberfield.  The
next date of significance in the plaintiff's story is that in April 1992
following a
dispute about marriage she moved out of Haberfield and rented a
flat in her own name at 2/22 Prospect Road, Summer Hill.  She furnished
it with
her furniture and took a six months' lease in her own name in respect of this
property.  While she was still living there
and prior to her getting together
again with the defendant she purchased a unit 11/26 Waterside Crescent,
Carramar.  She used the
funds which she had obtained from the sale of the
Liverpool unit and some borrowed funds from St George Bank.  She moved in with
the intention of living there.  In September 1992 the plaintiff and the
defendant when they were out one evening at the Apia Club
won a cruise to the
South Pacific.  In that month they both went on that cruise.
<P>

7	According to the plaintiff in December 1992 she returned to live in the
residence at Haberfield.  The defendant had in 1988 resolved
his financial
affairs with his wife and one of the properties which he retained was the
matrimonial home at Haberfield.  
<P>

8	On 1 July 1995 the relationship, according to the plaintiff, ended.  She sold
her unit in Carramar and with the proceeds, later
in that year, purchased a
property at Holbrook in Southern New South Wales to which she moved.  
<P>

	<b>The Defendant's version of the relationship.</b>
<P>

9	The defendant's version of events was somewhat different.  The defendant who
was born on 26 September 1933 first had contact with
the plaintiff in 1976.
This was when she came to work for him.  He says that there was social contact
between them between 1982 and
1985 and that in 1985 they commenced a sexual
relationship.  He, according to his evidence, separated from his wife in 1984
when
he was living at the matrimonial home at Haberfield.  In mid 1985 he moved
to a property which he and his wife owned at Brighton-le-Sands
and remained
there until early 1986.  He then moved to the accommodation which he had built
in his factory premises.  The defendant
says that in 1986 his son, Adrian,
joined him in the factory premises and for that purpose he constructed an extra
room there for
Adrian.  The defendant freely concedes that from 1985 the
parties had a sexual relationship and that they would socialise and go
out
together.  He concedes that the plaintiff would sometimes stay overnight after
they had been out or, alternatively, he might
stay overnight at the plaintiff's
property.  
<P>

10	On 3 March 1988 there was a property settlement and under that the defendant
received the matrimonial home at Haberfield, the
factory and one of two Callala
Beach properties which the defendant and his wife had owned.  Following the
property settlement the
defendant says that he and Adrian with minimal help
from the plaintiff renovated the Haberfield property and that in late 1990 he
and his son, Adrian, moved in to live.  The defendant says that in late 1990,
after the plaintiff had sold her Liverpool unit, she
asked if she could move in
to Haberfield.  He agreed and in early 1991 she moved in to Haberfield.
Apparently, according to the defendant,
she wanted the bedroom that Adrian, the
defendant's son was occupying  which meant that Adrian left home.  The
defendant concedes
that the plaintiff resided at Haberfield from February 1991
until April 1992.  In April 1992, and in this regard the parties' stories
are
consistent, the defendant says that the plaintiff moved out and rented the flat
at Prospect Street, Summer Hill.  The defendant
denies that thereafter they had
ever lived together although he concedes that they continued to socialise
together, occasionally
stayed at each other's place and that they had a sexual
relationship up until mid 1995.  
<P>

11	One can see therefore the periods of cohabitation alleged by the plaintiff
were as follows:-
<P>

Late 1984 to September 1986 at 17A Clissold Street, Ashfield.
<P>

March/April 1987 until late 1990 at the factory.
<P>

Early 1991 until April 1992 at Haberfield.
<P>

December 1992 until July 1995 at Haberfield.
<P>

12	There are thus two periods of separation, on the plaintiff version, namely,
from September 1986 until March 1987 and from April
1992 until December
1992.
<P>

13	For the defendant's part he concedes that they lived in the same household
from early 1991 until April 1992.  He denies that
it was even then a defacto
relationship.  
<P>

	
<P>

<b>	Law on the existence of a defacto relationship.</b>
<P>

14	The question of whether or not the plaintiff and the defendant were living
together as husband and wife on a bona fide domestic
basis must be determined
in accordance with the principles recently referred to by the Court of Appeal
in Light v Anderson &amp;
Ors (1992) DFC 95120.  They referred with approval to
the decision of Mr Justice Kearney in Simonis v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2021%20NSWLR%20677" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 21 NSWLR 677</a> where his Honour in dealing with the similar expression in
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act 1982</a> after reviewing the authorities said at page 685
the following:- 
<P>

	 "I consider that the expression under consideration constitutes a single
composite expression of a comprehensive notion or concept
and therefore has to
be approached by considering the expression as a whole and not in several
parts.      This approach, as adopted
by Powell J, was also the approach
preferred by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Waterford's case (see 106).
I consider that
the factors referred to by Powell J, while not being regarded
as a complete test, serve the purpose adequately in the present case
to
determine the question of eligible person.  The factors indicated by Powell J
are as follows (at 459)): 
<P>

	"1.  The duration of the relationship.
<P>

	2.   The nature and extent of the common residence.
<P>

	3.   Whether or not a sexual relationship existed.
<P>

	4.   The degree of financial interdependence and any arrangements for support,
between or by the parties.
<P>

	5.   The ownership, use and acquisition of property.
<P>

	6.   The procreation of children.
<P>

	7.   The care and support of children.
<P>

	8.   The performance of household duties.
<P>

	9.   The degree of mutual commitment and mutual support. 
<P>

	10.  Reputation and 'public' aspects of the relationship."
<P>

15	His Honour also referred to the support to be gained for this approach from
the report of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission
concerning de facto
relationships (LRC 36 (1983)).  His Honour quoted the following passage in the
report (at 459):
<P>

	17.10. The application of the basic definition to the myriad facets of private
personal relationships between men and women will
inevitably be a matter of
degree and proportion.  The attributes and circumstances of such relationships
differ greatly, ranging
from what is little more than a casual liaison, to a
continuing affectionate companionship, to a long term merging of lives and
resources.
 Moreover, the nature and quality of a particular relationship may
change and develop over time, making it sometimes very difficult
to pin-point a
time when the relationship should assume a new legal significance."  
<P>

16	and said:-
<P>

	"As I understand it, the parties substantially treated Powell J's approach as
being appropriate to the circumstances of the present
case."
<P>

17	Obviously, the list is not immutable and in particular cases other factors
will have to be considered.  The list is of use and
it is convenient to discuss
many of the incidents of the relationship between the plaintiff and the
deceased under the headings set
out above.
<P>

	<b>Credit</b>
<P>

18	Before dealing with that it is necessary to deal with questions of credit in
relation to the parties and some witnesses.  Although
at times the plaintiff
appeared to give her evidence in a straightforward way I had a number of
difficulties with her evidence that
cause me to doubt its reliability and her
truthfulness.  In a number of areas the documents for which she was responsible
portrayed
quite a different picture from the case she tried to present to the
Court.  For example, her income tax returns consistently showed
her home
address as being at a place different from what she alleged in these
proceedings was where she was living.  For example
for the period December 1992
to July 1995 she alleged that she was living with the defendant at his home at
Haberfield.  However,
that address was not shown in her tax returns.  In
addition she did not disclose in those returns at the relevant times that  she
was living in a defacto relationship.  Similarly in respect of an application
to Social Security she showed her address at a place
inconsistent with her
story presented to this Court.
<P>

19	Another area where her evidence caused me disquiet was the inaccuracies in
her witness statements.  In particular her witness
statement of 18 November
1997 as amended by her statement of 29 April 1998.  They gave quite different
versions of events to that
given in her later statement in 1999 and in her oral
evidence.  Examples are:-
<P>

1.	Her statements in paragraph 12A that the defendant gave her a ring to
celebrate being together for eleven years.  That was quite
contrary to her oral
evidence given in chief which was that the defendant gave her a ring and asked
her wear it because he was upset
at representatives who would call at the front
office, talk to the plaintiff and occasionally ask her out believing that she
was
not married. 
<P>

2.	Her first statements failed to mention a period of separation.
<P>

3.	When errors in the first statement were corrected in the second statement
that statement still omitted to deal with another admitted
period of
separation.  
<P>

4.	Her dates in the first statement for the date on which she purchased the
property at Liverpool were in error by two years.  
<P>

20	These matters cause me real concern as to the reliability of the plaintiff's
evidence.  Later in this judgment I will deal a
document (Exhibit 6) created by
the plaintiff.  My conclusions on the facts surrounding that document lead me
to the view that the
plaintiff was not truthful.
<P>

21	The defendant gave his evidence in a fairly straightforward way but he at
times gave inherently improbable answers to a number
of questions.  For
example, against the admitted background of the two parties on his case having
had a sexual relationship from
1985 to 1995 when taxed about whether he was
affectionate to the plaintiff he denied it.  On being shown photographs showing
him
with his arm around the plaintiff his explanation was merely that that was
the only time he had ever put his arm around the plaintiff.
 At other times
when he was confronted with documents that clearly showed the plaintiff's
address at his home at Haberfield he retreated
into a claim that the plaintiff
was at that stage blackmailing him by requiring him to write or show that
address in the documents.
 There was no suggestion in the evidence prior to
this time of there ever being any such conduct on the plaintiff's part.  As the
discussion later in this judgment will show when dealing with the evidence of
the plaintiff and the defendant at times they have
both taken up positions
which are quite contrary to either the documentary evidence or what is
inherently likely.  I will treat the
defendant's evidence with reserve as to
its reliability and truthfulness.
<P>

22	The plaintiff's daughter and son-in-law, Mr and Mrs Horne gave evidence.  I
was impressed with both these witnesses whom I thought
tried to give their
evidence honestly and frankly.  Unfortunately their evidence only touches a
limited part of the area of dispute
before me because in 1988 they moved to
Holbrook and did not have contact with the parties except for that which I will
refer to
later in this judgment.  The defendant's son gave evidence in support
of his father's case.  I am prepared to accept his evidence
but bear in mind
his age at the relevant times.
<P>

23	Mr Losurdo and Mr Vella, friends of the defendant, gave evidence.  There is
nothing in the way they gave their evidence which
would lead me not to accept
them.  Unfortunately their evidence was in very general terms, was imprecise so
far as dates were concerned
and, accordingly, not of a great deal of
assistance.  Although Mrs Marino gave evidence of an association between the
defendant and
herself her evidence was given frankly and truthfully but cross
examination demonstrated the period of their association was mostly
likely
during the period from September 1986 until April 1987 when, on the plaintiff's
version, there was a separation between the
plaintiff and the defendant.
<P>

24	I turn to deal with the question of whether there was a defacto relationship
by reference to the points referred to above.
<P>

	<b>1. The duration of the relationship.</b>
<P>

25	On each party's version the relationship is one which covered a substantial
period of time.  There was a period of at least 18
years when the parties were
socialising together and prior to that the plaintiff had worked for the
defendant for six years.  
<P>

	<b>2. &amp; 3. The nature and extent of the common residence and when a sexual
relationship commenced.</b>
<P>

26	It is hard to deal with this residence separately without also dealing with
the third question as to whether or not a sexual
relationship existed.  On this
aspect the plaintiff puts the commencement of the sexual relationship in 1981
and she said it continued
until separation in the middle of 1995. She says that
even during periods of separation the parties would still occasionally have
a
sexual relationship.  The defendant also admits the continuance of the
relationship up until mid 1995 but says that it did not
commence until he
received the dissolution application from his former wife in about August 1985.
On the defendant's version he admits
seeing the plaintiff socially from about
1982 and says that at that time he was married and living with his wife.  He
continued to
do so until he separated in 1984 when he and his wife continued to
reside in the same house notwithstanding separation.  
<P>

<b>	Late 1984 to September 1986</b>
<P>

27	The first period of the residence which is in dispute is the period from
late 1984 until September 1986.  At that stage the plaintiff
was living at
Ashfield in rented accommodation.  She had been sharing that accommodation with
her daughter since 1982 and according
to the plaintiff the defendant moved in
to live with her at Ashfield after her daughter married on 15 December 1984 and
moved out
of the house.  The evidence of the daughter and the son-in-law, Mr
Horne, is instructive.  The plaintiff's daughter gave evidence
that during 1984
the defendant came to the house with her mother and often stayed the night
sleeping in her mother's room.  This
caused her daughter some concern and she
informed her mother that she would not be happy if the defendant moved in while
she was
still living in the house.  She had indeed met the defendant some years
earlier.  She was married on 15 December 1984 and immediately
left on her
honeymoon.  When she and her husband returned some weeks later they were picked
up from the airport and taken back to
Ashfield.  The plaintiff's son-in-law
gave evidence that he, his wife, the plaintiff and the defendant, spent that
night at the premises.
 He gave evidence that on that evening the defendant
stayed with the plaintiff in the main bedroom. The plaintiff's daughter also
said that on occasions when visiting Ashfield after she had been married, at
her mother's direction, she went to the clothesline
and took from the line
clothes of the defendant and put them away in drawers in the plaintiff's
bedroom.  She observed the defendant's
clothes in her mother's bedroom.  I have
earlier commented on the nature of the evidence given by the plaintiff's
daughter and son-in-law
and I see no reason not to accept their evidence of
what happened in 1984 and in particular when they returned from their honeymoon
and spent the night with the parties.  
<P>

28	Also of note in this period is the fact that the defendant admits he put up
a shade cloth in the back yard at Ashfield and stored
under it some orchids
which his parents had left him.  According to Mr Horne he also maintained a
vegetable garden at Ashfield. 
Given this evidence which I accept I think it is
on balance likely that the plaintiff and the defendant lived together at
Ashfield
from late December 1984.  The cessation of cohabitation appears to
have occurred because of an argument between the plaintiff and
the defendant
about defendant's daughter, Leana.  I also conclude that a sexual relationship
existed from at least early 1984 if
not earlier.
<P>

29	There is then a period of admitted separation on the plaintiff's part from
September 1986 until March or April 1987.  In that
period she purchased a unit
at 4/15 Nagle Street, Liverpool.  The purchase of that was completed on 20
February 1987 and the plaintiff
moved in to that unit with her furniture.  She
continued to own this unit until she arranged to sell it at the end of 1990
settlement
taking place on 25 January 1991.  
<P>

<b>	March/April 1987 to December 1990.</b>
<P>

30	The next period of residence together on the plaintiff's evidence is between
March or April 1987 until the end of 1990.  She
says that this came about
because of the fact that she found the travel from work at the defendant's
factory to Liverpool time consuming
and tiring.  One matter which is strange
and has to be taken into account when evaluating where the parties lived is the
fact that
the plaintiff did not let her property at Liverpool during the period
that she says she in fact lived with the defendant.  Her move,
according to her
evidence, was that she moved into the factory premises at Hubert Street,
Leichhardt.  Those premises were in an
area zoned for both commercial and
residential purposes and the defendant had modified part of the factory to
serve as living quarters
for himself.  There is no doubt that during this
period the parties were together.  There were visits to family and friends and,
for example, at times the plaintiff and the defendant visited the plaintiff's
children, her son in Albury and also her daughter and
son-in-law at Holbrook.
The defendant and his son at one stage went to Italy for a trip and the
plaintiff met them on their return
in Singapore where they holidayed before
returning to Australia.  When considering the general arrangements between the
parties it
should also be noted that by late 1988 the defendant had resolved
his property dispute with his former wife and he had retained the
matrimonial
home at Haberfield.  He sold some other properties to pay out his wife and she
moved out of Haberfield and left it for
him.  Thereafter between 1988 and late
1990 the defendant and his son worked during weekends on renovations to the
house and were
assisted by the plaintiff.  The defendant concedes that there
was some assistance but the quality or extent of such assistance as
the
plaintiff alleges is not conceded.  
<P>

31	One area of the evidence that was investigated in cross examination was the
wages records which were maintained by the plaintiff
for the defendant as part
of her duties as bookkeeper.  Those records showed the plaintiff`s address as
being either Ashfield, Liverpool
her rented premises at Summer Hill or the
property she purchased at Carramar.  They did not show her address at
Haberfield even for
the admitted period that she lived there or the factory
where she alleged she stayed with the defendant.  Similarly the defendant's
address was always shown as Haberfield apart from one period in 1985 when the
address was changed to Brighton-le-Sands.  This was
another property that he
owned.  That address was changed back to Haberfield in mid 1998 no doubt once
his wife had moved out and
he had sold Brighton-le-Sands in order to pay out
his wife. It seems to me that not much assistance can be gained from these
records
in terms of where people were residing.  The addresses seem to be
merely the formal or legal addresses of people at the property
that they owned
or leased and does deal with the defacto situation nor, indeed, did it need to
deal with the defacto situation. 
The period at which the defendant's address
is shown as Brighton-le-Sands does not even coincide with his evidence as to
when he
resided there.  That evidence indicated that he resided there in early
1985 but the plaintiff puts him residing there prior to December
1984 when he
moved in with her at Ashfield.  
<P>

32	The defendant conceded that in this period with which I am concerned the
plaintiff would stay with him over the weekends at the
factory.
<P>

33	There was evidence given by Adrian Maretta the defendant's son about this
period with which I am concerned.  He says that in
1986 when he was 14 years
old he moved out of the Haberfield home and went to live with his father in
factory where the business
was operated.  He says that he would spend the week
living with his father at the factory and would spend the weekends at his
mother's
home at Haberfield.  He did observe the plaintiff staying overnight at
the factory on occasions during the week and he also recalls
her staying there
on the weekends.  One of the reasons he went to his mother's house in the
weekends was to make room for the plaintiff
in the very cramped accommodation
at the factory.  This evidence from the defendant's son is consistent with the
defendant's story
and there is no particular reason why I should not accept it.
There was also evidence from the plaintiff's daughter and son-in-law
that on
Mondays the plaintiff and her daughter would meet at the Liverpool unit and go
after dinner to a gym class.  The son-in-law
would drive his wife out to
Liverpool for this purpose.  The evidence is not clear precisely when this
practice occurred.  It was
certainly prior to September 1988 when the daughter
and son-in-law moved Holbrook from Sydney.  In cross examination the
son-in-law,
Mr Horne that it was every Monday night after the purchase of the
Liverpool property that this occurred.  He was not asked specifically
whether
it continued up to September 1998 when they moved to Holbrook.  That however
was the flavour of his evidence.  In these circumstances
it seems to me that
the plaintiff and defendant resumed their relationship in March or April 1987
and that their residence was such
that they resided together during the
weekends and sometimes during the week at Haberfield but for the majority of
the week the plaintiff
resided at the Liverpool unit while the defendant
resided at the factory.  This is consistent with the plaintiff leaving it
furnished
and not letting the unit.
<P>

<b>	December 1990 to April 1992</b>
<P>

34	Towards the end of 1990 two significant events occurred.  They were first
the completion by the defendant of the renovations
to Haberfield.  All that
remained at this stage was to renovate the kitchen.  The other event was the
sale by the plaintiff of the
unit at Liverpool.  It is clear on the evidence of
both parties that the plaintiff moved into Haberfield at the end of 1990 or
early
in 1991 and that she shared that residence with the defendant until April
1992.  At that time there was a dispute between the parties
over the
defendant's continuing refusal to marry the plaintiff.  The plaintiff moved out
and rented premises at Summer Hill for a
period of six months.  
<P>

<b>	December 1992 to July 1995</b>
<P>

35	By September of that year the plaintiff had purchased the unit at Carramar
to which she moved.  Shortly after this occurred in
late 1992 the plaintiff and
the defendant were visiting a club where they won a prize which was a trip on a
ship cruising the Pacific.
 They went on the cruise and, according to the
plaintiff, when they returned she commenced to reside with the defendant at
Haberfield.
 She says she remained there until 1 July 1995 and on the
plaintiff's version the relationship ceased.  The defendant's case was
that she
did not reside at Haberfield during this period from late 1992 until mid 1995.
The position that the defendant took on this
aspect tended to break down when
he was confronted with a series of different incidences confirmed by separate
evidence which showed
that he and the plaintiff were living together at
Haberfield at this time.  
<P>

36	The first of these arose out of the fact that in April 1993 there was an
Italian singer, Enrico Farina, who came to Australia
and stayed with the
defendant for some three days.  That produced two cards which were sent from
overseas addressed to Mr and Mrs
Fred Maretta at 92 Kingsford Street,
Haberfield.  Faced with this the defendant conceded that the plaintiff was also
staying there
for two days when the singer and his manager were his guests.
The next occasion was when the defendant's brother came from overseas
and
stayed with the defendant.  Once again the cards after the visit were sent from
the brother on his return addressed Mrs Norma
Maretta.  Faced with this the
defendant again conceded that the plaintiff had been staying there at the time
of his brother's visit.
 The next occasion was in April 1995 when the
plaintiff's daughter and son-in-law came and stayed at Haberfield for five days
as
they had to attend a Sydney wedding.  At that stage they had a young son,
Tom.  They gave evidence of the plaintiff being present
and there the whole
time and sharing a bedroom with defendant.  In the mornings their own son would
go in and share the plaintiff
and the defendant's bed and play with them.  This
occurred again in late April prior to going overseas and again six months later
on their return.  Faced with this evidence, once again, for the third time, the
defendant conceded that the plaintiff just happened
to stay for a few days to
look after her daughter and son-in-law.  These accounts of the defendant are
inherently improbable and
there are other items of evidence tending to suggest
that Haberfield was the address of the plaintiff at that time.  For example,
there were applications for temporary membership of clubs issued or filled in
by the plaintiff when the defendant would use his membership
to obtain
temporary admission for the plaintiff.  In them the plaintiff's address was
shown as Haberfield.  Also shortly prior to
the final separation on 1 July 1995
a form for membership was signed by the defendant showing the plaintiff, Mrs
Maretta, having
her address at Haberfield.  Overall I am satisfied that the
parties lived together in a common residence between late 1992 and 1
July 1995
at the defendant's house at Haberfield notwithstanding that the plaintiff did
not let her unit at Carramar.
<P>

<b>	4.   The degree of financial interdependence and any arrangements for
support, between or by the parties.</b>
<P>

37	There is not a great deal in the evidence in relation to this area although
the defendant conceded that when they were together
he would pay for household
expenses.  He, of course, also paid expenses of his property.  
<P>

	<b>5.   The ownership, use and acquisition of property.</b>
<P>

38	In this regard the parties' property has been kept completely separate.  The
plaintiff purchased the real estate which she owned
in the name of McKone and
when she sold the unit at Liverpool she simply invested her funds and did not
use them for the purpose
of the relationship.  She ultimately used those funds
again to purchase the unit at Carramar which was once again in her name,
McKone.
 
<P>

39	The defendant had his properties in his own name and the parties each
maintained their own separate bank accounts.  There were
no joint accounts or
in fact any jointly owned property.
<P>

	<b>6.   The procreation of children.</b>
<P>

40	Not relevant.
<P>

	<b>7.   The care and support of children.</b>
<P>

41	Both parties had children by their marriages but given the ages of the
children there was no great opportunity for there to be
parenting
contributions.  The only one alleged is by the plaintiff in respect of the
defendant's son, Adrian.  She says that when
she was living at the factory
between 1987 and 1990 she would get his lunch in the morning before he went to
school and helped him
with homework.  This was denied by the defendant's son.
Given my acceptance of his evidence earlier as to the occupation I think
there
were only minor matters that would have been provided by the plaintiff in this
regard.
<P>

	<b>8.   The performance of household duties.</b>
<P>

42	Once again, there is little evidence about this.  The parties tend to agree
that they would share household duties, including
cooking, and they did
regularly go out for meals.  There was some dispute about the extent of
washing.  The plaintiff suggested she
was doing the washing at Haberfield but
the defendant maintained the contrary saying that he and his son did it at a
laundromat.
<P>

	<b>9.   The degree of mutual commitment and mutual support. </b>
<P>

43	There is little evidence going to this aspect.  The one matter which might
have gone to it was giving the ring to the plaintiff
by the defendant.  The
circumstances in which that was given as explained by the plaintiff in her
evidence in chief in the witness
box certainly refutes there being any evidence
of commitment.  Clearly she wore the ring from time to time as can be seen from
photographs.
 The defendant completely denies purchasing or giving the
plaintiff the ring.
<P>

44	There was a suggestion that the plaintiff made that the defendant was going
to move his business to Vietnam and leave her to
run the business in Sydney.
That did not materialise.
<P>

	<b>10.  Reputation and 'public' aspects of the relationship.</b>
<P>

45	There is abundant evidence by way of photographs of the association between
the plaintiff and the defendant in a public way.
 They show attendance at
friends' weddings, attendance at clubs dancing together and attendance at
various family functions.  The
photographs during the cruise show them as Mr
and Mrs Maretta and I have already adverted to the evidence of the application
to join
the club and the temporary applications showing the plaintiff as Mrs
Maretta.  There was a deal of evidence from friends of the defendant
where they
indicated that the defendant had introduced the plaintiff, as Norma, but I do
not think that is of great weight.
<P>

46	Such evidence that there is would tend to suggest that the plaintiff and the
defendant were known as a couple together and at
times as Mr and Mrs Maretta.
Clearly they made no secret that they were together.
<P>

	<b>Termination of the relationship at different times.</b>
<P>

47	Having dealt with all the individual aspects it is necessary, of course, to
come to a view about whether the parties were at
the relevant times in a
defacto relationship.  Although the parties kept their property separate I do
not think in this case it is
decisive.  The defendant's acquisition of property
occurred prior to meeting the plaintiff and the plaintiff's in part came from
her savings.  There seems to have been an involvement by both parties in
family situations with the defendant's relatives and the
plaintiff's children.
The difficult period to conclude that there was a defacto relationship is the
period from March or April 1987
to end December 1990.  In my view the
arrangements were merely in the nature of a weekend arrangement whereby the
plaintiff would
reside with the defendant over the weekends and occasionally
during the week.  Residence is an important part of living together
in a
relationship.  In the present case there are clearly different periods of the
relationship and one has to give consideration
as to whether in any particular
period there was a defacto relationship and whether it terminated at the end of
a period of residence.
 
<P>

48	This raises the question of how a relationship of this nature does
terminate.  There have been a number of references in the
cases to the problem
which started to surface in Australia in cases under matrimonial legislation
which provided for parties living
separately and apart as a ground for divorce.
An earlier case which is of use on the general principles is Main v Main  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20CLR%20636" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978)
CLR 636.</a>  At page 642 in the joint decision of the majority the following was
said:- 
<P>

	"Although usually the existence of the conjugal or matrimonial relationship or
consortium vitae means that the spouses share a
common home and live in the
closest association, it is not inconsistent with absences one from another,
even for very long periods
of time.  It rests rather on a real mutual
recognition by husband and wife that the marital relationship continues to
subsist and
a definite intention to resume the closer association of a common
life as soon as the occasion or exigency has passed which has led
to an
interruption regarded by both as temporary. 
<P>

	In deciding whether there was at any specified date an existing matrimonial
relationship, it is, I think, right to say that such
a relationship does not
end so long as both the spouses bona fide recognise it as subsisting, and in
particular it does not end by
reason of a separation brought about by the
pressure of external circumstances such as absence on professional or business
pursuits,
or in search of health, or, it may be, even of pleasure.  Marital
intercourse, the dwelling under the same roof, society and protection,
support,
recognition in public and in private, correspondence during separation, making
up as a whole the consortium vitae, which
the old writers distinguish from the
divortium a mensa et thoro, may be regarded separately as different elements,
the presence or
absence of which go to show more or less conclusively that the
matrimonial relationship does or does not exist.  The weight of each
of these
elements varies with the health, position in life, and all the other
circumstances of the parties." 
<P>

49	As indicated by the High Court, there are matters of degree of separation,
and particularly in accordance with the passages I
have indicated, separation
by reason of illness or otherwise does not mean that the relationship has
ceased. 
<P>

50	The matter also arises in cases under the De Facto Relationship Act in the
context of whether or not there have been several
separate periods of
relationship. This sometimes is significant because a period of relationship
and a separation period might be
before the commencement of the Act.  The
matter was dealt with at an early stage in <b>Hibberson v George</b>.  That was
a decision of his Honour Cohen J which went on appeal to the Court of Appeal.
At the trial his Honour Cohen J had the
following to say:- 
<P>

	"The use of the words 'living or having lived together as husband and wife on
a bona fide domestic basis' suggest a degree of permanence
which will not cease
merely because one party separates for the purpose of going on holidays or
going on business.  Nor would it
cease if, after an argument, one party moved
out and stayed elsewhere for a short while or went home to his or her family,
if there
was an intention to return and if there was a reasonable indication of
that intention.  See the views of the Law Reform Commission
in its report at
para 17.18. 
<P>

	It must be a question of fact whether on separation one party intended that
there should be an end to the relationship or whether
the parties or either of
them acted in such a way as would indicate that that intention existed.  Once
that intention or indication
is found to exist then, as occurred in McRae v
McRae (1967) 68 SR (NSW) 361, the relationship will only be renewed when the
parties
actually return and live together.  It would not be sufficient merely
to form an intention to enter into an agreement to resume life
together." 
<P>

51	The theme which his Honour there picked up was repeated in the words of
Mahoney JA in <b>Hibberson v George</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2012%20Fam%20LR%20725" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 12 Fam LR 725</a> at 740 where his
Honour said of the statutory definition the following:-
<P>

	"It is correct ... that the relevant relationship may continue notwithstanding
that the parties are apart, for example on holidays
... There is, of course,
more to a relevant relationship than living in the same house.  But there is, I
think, a significant distinction
between the relationship of marriage and the
instant relationship.  The relationship of marriage, being based in law,
continues notwithstanding
that all of the things for which it was created have
ceased.  Parties will live in the relationship of marriage notwithstanding that
they are separated, without children, and without the exchange of the incidents
which the relationship normally involves.  The essence
of the present
relationship lies, not in law, but in a de facto situation.   I do not mean by
this that cohabitation is essential
to its continuance:  holidays and the like
show this.  But where one party determines not to 'live together' with the
other and in
that sense keeps apart, the relationship ceases, even though it be
merely, as it was suggested in the present case, to enable the
one party or the
other to decide whether it should continue.  The learned judge, correctly,
treated the matter as a question of fact."

<P>

52	McHugh JA agreed with Mahoney JA.  Hope JA said he agreed with McHugh JA so
that it would seem that this expression by Mahoney
JA is a considered view of
the Court of Appeal. 
<P>

53	Since then the matter has been considered in a number of cases.  In
particular, Powell JA has dealt with this on a number of
occasions.  In
<b>Lipman v Lipman</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2013%20Fam%20LR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 13 Fam LR 1</a>, his Honour had the following to
say:- 
<P>

	"Although I accept that the concept of 'a de facto relationship' does not
involve the notion that the parties to it must always
be together under the
same roof, so that such a relationship may continue to subsist notwithstanding
the absence of one party from
'the matrimonial home', and although I do not
discount the possibility that 'a de facto relationship' may properly be
regarded as
continuing notwithstanding that the parties may have separated only
temporarily while they attempted to work through some difficulty
which they had
encountered in their relationship, I am quite unable to see how such a
relationship can be said to continue in a case,
such as this, in which the 'de
facto husband' requires the 'de facto wife' to leave the 'matrimonial home' and
installs another in
her place.  As Mahoney JA said in Hibberson v George 12 Fam
LR at 740;  DFC at 75, supra.:  'The essence of the present relationship
lies,
not in law, but in a de facto situation.  I do not mean by this that
cohabitation is essential to its continuance;  holidays
and the like show this.
But where one party determines not to "live together" with the other and in
that sense keeps apart, the relationship
ceases, even though it be merely, as
it was suggested in the present case, to enable the one party or the other to
decide whether
it should continue.'  I therefore conclude that, in this case,
there were two discrete 'de facto relationships'." 
<P>

54	In <b>Thomson v Badger</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=13%20Fam%20LR%20559" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">13 Fam LR 559</a>, his Honour Young J had to deal
with a case where, as does not infrequently happen, the relationship was one
which was interrupted
by absences on quite a number of occasions.  His Honour
referred to the cases to which I have referred and also referred to
<b>Australian National Railways Commission  v Gerlach</b> (1987) DFC 95/048.
He used that as a reference to the fact that one must view the circumstances in
which the  parties ceased to live
under the same roof in the context of their
total relationship and he posed the question that one must ask in the context
of the
total relationship was whether there was a mere lovers' quarrel or a
termination of the relationship.  His Honour looked at the case
in hand and
described it as one:- 
<P>

	"... not being the happiest of relationships but was one which always
continued on from where it left off.  There was an incident,
a separation, then
usually a short time later the parties got together on the same basis again as
before.  In my view the proper
determination of the factual question raised is
that there was a de facto relationship which continued  ..." 
<P>

55	The matter has also been again referred to by Powell JA in <b>Theodoropoulos
v Theodosiou</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2038%20NSW%20LR%20424" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 38 NSW LR 424</a>, where he referred, with approval, to the
statement of Mahoney JA.
<P>

56	Also in Gazzard v Winders unreported Court of Appeal 23 July 1998, he once
again quoted with approval the statement by Mahoney
JA in <b>Hibberson v
George</b>.  In that case Beazley JA had the following comments to make about
<b>Hibberson v George</b>:- 
<P>

	"I would comment in passing only that I do not endorse in any unqualified way
the comments of Mahoney JA in <b>Hibberson v George</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2012%20Fam%20LR%20725" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 12 Fam LR 725.</a>
For myself, I do not know that it accords either with reality or a proper
construction of the Act to find that an interruption which,
in a long
relationship, may be no more than a hiccup, would have completely brought the
relationship to an end.  In any event, I
can see no reason  why a short
interruption of the relationship for six weeks in a period of fourteen and a
half years should prevent
the court from taking into account the circumstance
that this was a lengthy relationship of that order.  Even if I am wrong, I
consider
ten and a half years to be a relationship of a lengthy duration." 
<P>

57	In the light of those matters, I think clearly there is a strong weight of
authority which supports the view expressed by Mahoney
JA in the Court of
Appeal in <b>Hibberson v George</b>.  Of particular note is his view that:- 
<P>

	"...where one party determines not 'to live together' with the other and in
that sense keeps apart, the relationship ceases, even
though it be merely to
enable the one party or the other to decide whether it should continue." 
<P>

58	The qualification that perhaps emerges from what his Honour Young J was
referring to in Thomson v Badger is that when one has
a situation of frequent
interruptions and then a return to the relationship that may, in fact, lead
one, on  a factual basis, to
suggest that perhaps an expressed intention to
leave the relationship was not the real intention and was more a pattern of
behaviour.
 That is perhaps what Beazley JA was alluding to in her comments in
<b>Gazzard v Winders</b>.  But, in any event, she was also there more concerned
with the more difficult circumstance as to whether the Court can take into
account earlier periods of a relationship.
<P>

59	There are a number of times in this case when the question of when the
relationship terminated arises.  The first of these is
in September 1996 and
the evidences seems fairly clear that the parties had an argument and went
their separate ways.  In these circumstances
any defacto relationship would
have ceased in September 1996.  Another time was in April 1992.  The separation
was, as I have indicated
before, because the defendant refused to marry the
plaintiff.  There is no doubt that on occasions during the period of separation
the parties had sexual intercourse and would see each other socially.  However,
they did not live together.  The plaintiff has sworn
that she did not regard
the relationship as finally over.  However, it seems to me that although she
may have been contemplating
some continuance this does not mean that the
relationship has continued.  As was pointed out by Mahoney JA it is a question
of fact
and I am of the view that the plaintiff determined not to live with the
defendant and kept apart.
<P>

	<b>Bona fide domestic relationship - conclusion. </b>
<P>

60	For the periods I have found that the parties were residing together I am
satisfied that they were living together in a bona
fide domestic relationship.
More difficult is the period between April/March 1997 and December 1990 when
there was nothing more than
a weekend residence arrangement at the factory
premises.  In one sense having resumed their relationship one might regard it
as a
continuance of what was the former defacto relationship which existed
between November 1984 and September 1996.  However, given the
circumstances of
the residence arrangements I do not think it is appropriate to conclude that in
this period from March/April 1987
to November 1990 that there was a bona fide
defacto relationship.  This means that the periods when the relationship
existed and
the length of the period are as follows:-
<P>

	November 1984 to September 1996    22 months
<P>

	December 1990 to April 1992        16 months
<P>

	December 1992 to July 1995          2-1/2 years
<P>

	<b>Application for extension of time.</b>
<P>

61		The matter next to be considered is whether or not all these periods of the
relationship can be taken into account.  Section
18 is in the following
terms:-
<P>

	"(1)  Except as provided by subsections (2) and (3), where de facto partners
have ceased to live together as husband and wife on
a bona fide domestic basis,
an application to a court for an order under this Part shall be made before the
expiration of the period
of two years after the day on which they ceased, or
last ceased, as the case may require, to so live together.       
<P>

	(2)  A court may, at any time after the expiration of the period referred to
in subs (1), grant leave to a de facto partner to
apply to the court for an
order under this Part (other than an order under s 27 (1) made where the court
is satisfied as to the matters
specified in s 27 (1) (b) ).  Where the court is
satisfied, having regard to such matters as it considers relevant, that greater
hardship would be caused to the applicant if that leave were not granted than
would be caused to the respondent if that leave were
granted.       
<P>

	(3)  Where, under subs (2), a court grants a de facto partner leave to apply
to the court for an order under this Part, the de
facto partner may apply
accordingly."
<P>

62	During the course of the hearing the plaintiff filed a motion for leave
under s 18 (2) to apply for an order for the period between
late 1984 and early
April 1992.  She has done this because of the decision of the Court of Appeal
in <b>Fotheringham v Fotheringham </b>unreported 28 August 1998.  In that
matter I had at first instance concluded that in a case where there are two
discreet defacto relationships
then provided the application was made with two
years of the termination of the last period that it was possible without making
application
under s 18 to take into account the contributions made in the
earlier of the two defacto relationships.  In particular I noted that
s 18(1)
concluded with the words, "2 years after the day on which they ceased, or last
ceased, as the case may require, to so live
together".  On appeal His Honour Mr
Justice Powell held that this approach was wrong.  At pages 20 and 21 of his
judgment his Honour
held that the applicant for an order bears the onus of
establishing that the condition precedent in s 18 has been fulfilled or
alternatively
bears the onus of obtaining an order of court granting leave to
commence proceedings.  It was for this reason that the plaintiff
filed a notice
of motion with a view to obtaining leave under s 18 in respect of the earlier
period of cohabitation.  
<P>

63	Under section 18(2) the Court may grant leave where the court is satisfied,
having regard to such matters as it considers relevant,
that greater hardship
would be caused to the applicant if that leave were not granted than would be
caused to the respondent if that
leave were granted.  Normally this is put on
the basis that unless leave is given the plaintiff would not have the benefit
of an
adjustment which would take account of contributions made in the earlier
period.  However, in the present case the two earlier periods
of cohabitation
are each in respect of periods of less than two years.  This raises the
question of whether or not given this fact
a court could, on the final hearing,
in respect of the earlier periods of cohabitation, make an order bearing in
mind the provisions
of s 17.  Absent two years a court can only make an order
if there is a child of the parties, which does not apply in this case,
or there
have been substantial contributions for which the applicant could not be
adequately compensated. 
<P>

64	There is of course a question of construction which may have to be resolved
because it has been submitted to me that if the earlier
period is less than 2
years in duration then the Court would not grant leave under s18 because no
order could be made in respect
of that earlier period of cohabitation.  In
<b>Fotheringham v Fotheringham</b> the earlier period of cohabitation was more
than 2 years so the Court did not have to consider this point.  Putting this
point aside
at this stage I will first consider whether or not there are
substantial contributions during the early periods which may not be
recognised.
<P>

65	This requires one to look at the nature of the contributions which are
advanced by the plaintiff in this case.  In this regard
it is important to put
the general circumstances of this case in perspective.  We are here dealing
with a relationship between an
older couple who have previously had children by
their earlier marriages.  Each of them has their own separate property and
neither
has contributed in a financial sense to the property which the other
owned during the period of the relationship.  So far as non-financial
contributions are concerned, there is as I have indicated earlier been some
very minimal parenting contribution by the plaintiff
in respect of the
defendant's son, Adrian.  As far as household contributions are concerned both
parties were working throughout
the period of the relationship and they seemed
to share household duties equally between them apart from some dispute about
washing
for a period.  Another area of non-financial contribution was work that
the plaintiff alleges that she did to assist the defendant
and his son when
they were renovating Haberfield between 1987 and 1990.  Her work appears to
have been some gardening work and assisting
while the heavier work was done by
the defendant and his son.  It was only on weekends and part of the weekend and
is for a period
in which I have found that there was no relevant
relationship.
<P>

66	The area of substantial dispute between the parties on contributions relates
to one claim by the plaintiff.  This claim arises
out of the fact that she says
that for a period she worked for the defendant for no wages and at a later time
for reduced wages.
 In her first statement the plaintiff said that she received
an award wage for her work in the business until 1992 from which stage
she was
only paid $170 per week.  She said that the then correct wage was $400 per week
and that from 1992 on she was working seven
days a week.  She says that in
addition to performing secretarial and bookwork functions she assisted in
production, sales, deliveries
and cleaning.
<P>

67	By the time of trial the plaintiff's story in this regard changed.  She said
that her employment was terminated in early 1990.
 She was re-employed in
January 1991 when she worked for no wages until April 1992.  She produced a
reference signed by the defendant,
Exhibit H, dated 12 February 1990 which said
that she was employed from 6 September 1976 to 31 January 1990.  The reference
said
that her employment had been terminated due to slow trading.  The
defendant's answer to these allegations of no payment and reduced
payments was
quite simple.  It was that, in fact, the plaintiff arranged for her wages to be
paid to her in cash for the period 1990
to 1992 when she received no wages in
the records of the company and after 1992 she arranged for her wages to be
supplemented with
additional cash drawings from the company so that she was
paid $300 per week.  
<P>

68	There is no doubt that the defendant's business was not progressing well.
It had been going downhill slowly since 1984 and his
indebtedness had been
rising.  However, it also turned out that the plaintiff at the beginning of
1990 happened to commence receiving
Social Security payments.  
<P>

69	The truth as to what was happening was probably best shown by a document of
the plaintiffs which is Exhibit 6.  This was a document
in which she calculated
her entitlements to long service leave and holiday pay once her employment was
terminated in October 1995
some time after the termination of the relationship
in July 1995.  Because it is important I set out the terms of that document.
<P>

	HOLIDAY PAY                     42 weeks
<P>

<P>

	WEEKS WAGE          =   $300.00
<P>

70	It will be seen in the middle of the document that there is a reference to
having been paid some long service leave for ten years.
 That occurred when the
plaintiff was getting enough money together to buy the unit at Liverpool.  She
arranged for the defendant
to pay long service leave up to that time to help
her with that purchase.  However, what is obvious from this document is a
calculation
of entitlement to holiday pay based on figures shown in the "book"
and figures for "cash".  Also of importance is the week's wage
of $300 which is
what the defendant agreed she had been paid during the period.  There is a
clear calculation by her based upon the
fact that she had been receiving wages
partly in the book and partly by cash and in respect of cash no tax was
deducted.  The plaintiff's
explanation when she was tackled with this document
was totally unconvincing.  It is worth noting the difference between what is
in
her first statement and that which appears in her second statement.  In her
first statement she said she was paid an award wage
up until 1992 and
thereafter at $170 per week.  Her second statement, Exhibit A, paragraphs 20
and 39 and 40 and 44 apart from being
internally inconsistent are deliberately
vague.  The correct situation is clearly shown in Exhibit 6, namely, that the
plaintiff
was paid wages partly or wholly in cash at $300 per week.  No doubt
this was to avoid problems with Social Security.  The plaintiff
continued
receiving Social Security until towards the end of 1990 and has claimed a
contribution from her alleged re-employment in
January 1991.
<P>

71	The purpose of considering this matter carefully is, of course, to see
whether in the earlier periods with which I am concerned
with in the
applications for leave, namely, December 1984 to September 1986 and December
1990 to April 1992 the plaintiff made some
substantial contributions arising
from lack of payment of wages to the plaintiff.  There is no doubt in respect
of the first period
the records show she was paid a wage from the business at
the rate of $300 and somewhat less in the earlier years.  The wages records
book shows her ceasing to receive a wage on 31 January 1990 and it recommences
with her receiving on 1 April 1992 $176 a week gross
which is about the time
she left the defendant for the second time.
<P>

72	For the purpose of looking at the contributions in the period from January
1991 to April 1992 the plaintiff received a wage which
I have found was $300
per week.  One then has to look at that wage and see whether it was, for
instance, below the award.  This is
a period when she was not alleging that she
was doing substantial extra work in the factory.  There is a Clerks' Award in
evidence
which applies to people, such as the plaintiff.  There was a
submission that as she was managerial it would not apply but I do not
think her
duties would have exempted her from the award.  That award applies to different
levels depending upon the responsibility
of the person.  Grade 1 is the most
responsible and assuming this for the present purposes, one finds that the
award wage from 9
February 1990 was $387.90, from 26 February 1991 $402.90 and
from 16 September 1991 $413.  For this period the plaintiff was paid
$300 per
week and accordingly the amount underpaid would be in the order of $105 per
week for 15 months resulting in a sum of $6,933
gross.  I say gross because, no
doubt, the amount actually received would have been less because of tax
deductions.  However, given
that she was not paying tax on this cash money
there was a substantial benefit to her.  A perusal of the wages book would
indicate
that the likely tax on $400 per week is in the order of $63 leaving a
net loss of $37 per week.  For 15 months this is a total of
$2,404.  
<P>

73	In these circumstances it seems to me, having regard to the contributions
for the period, December 1990 to April 1992 that they
could not be described as
substantial and, accordingly, there would appear to be no reason why the
plaintiff should be entitled to
an extension of time.  For the period December
1984 to September 1986 the plaintiff was paid the award wage and the same
result applies
to this period.
<P>

74	The above discussion is predicated upon of course the requirement that a
proper construction of the legislation is that there
needs to be a period of
two years or the other specified matters before the Court will exercise its
discretion.  Before addressing
the argument as to whether this is right I might
mention the question of delay.  Obviously the application is out of time.  The
plaintiff
has said in relation to the period from April 1992 onwards she had
not given up hope of the defendant and her getting back together.
 She did not
learn about her right to make an application under the Act until 1996 which was
well after the final separation in July
1995.  The separation from September
1986 to April 1987 was less than two years and although not in a defacto
relationship from April
1987 to December 1990 there was a serious relationship
between the parties.  In these circumstances I think that the explanation
is
sufficient. 
<P>

75	The alternative way of looking at the question of deciding whether to grant
leave is to approach it on the basis that one is
not looking at a separate
application for adjustment of rights under the Act for which a two year period
should apply but one is
considering whether the earlier period can be taken
into account in a subsequent application.  Section 18(2) refers to hardship and
the failure to take into account a party's contribution for a period less than
two years could amount to hardship.  There is nothing
in s 18 which would
require these contributions to be "substantial" as is required s 17.  The
object of the Act is to adjust parties'
property interests having regard to
their contributions.  Bearing this in mind I am of the view that there is no
requirement that
for a period to be taken into account it must be for at least
two years provided there is a two year period upon which the application
can be
based.
<P>

76	Accordingly, I think that leave ought to be granted to bring these
proceedings in respect of the two earlier periods of the parties'
defacto
relationship.
<P>

	<b>The parties' property </b>
<P>

77	I will now consider the property of the parties at the commencement of the
relationship and the property of the parties at the
end.  There was in fact no
joint property of the parties and the evidence did not address in any detail
the nature of the property
which each had at the relevant times.  So far as
does appear it is clear that in 1987 the plaintiff purchased the Liverpool unit
for $41,000 using a mortgage advance of some $30,000.  She had furniture
insured for $23,000 and no other assets.  She did not drive
and did not own a
car.  The situation in 1984 consisted of her having such furniture and some
savings but no real estate.  By the
conclusion of the relationship she had the
unit at Carramar which she sold shortly after July 1995 for $92,100 from which
she received
$65,999 after payment out of the mortgage.  She applied $52,000 of
that money towards the purchase of her property at Holbrook. 
She had some
other furniture at that stage. 
<P>

78	So far as the defendant's position is concerned, his property settlement was
in 1988.  As a result of that settlement he had
the real estate at Haberfield
which was his former matrimonial home, factory premises and one of the two
properties at Callala Beach
together with the business.  The other assets he
had had before then were sold and used to make payments to his wife.  By the
time
of the conclusion of the relationship he had sold Callala Beach but he
still had the factory and his former matrimonial home together
with the
business.
<P>

79	Although the evidence is in an unsatisfactory state it is probably of little
importance considering the lack of joint assets.
 One has the contributions
which I have identified above and I return to deal with those in slightly more
detail.
<P>

	<b>Non-financial contributions</b>
<P>

80	I will first deal with the non-financial contributions to Haberfield.  The
plaintiff described the work she did between February
1988 and the end of 1989
as follows:-
<P>

	(a) Assisting with carpentry.
<P>

	(b) Assisting and replacing kitchen.
<P>

	(c) Making curtains.
<P>

	(d) Planning and maintaining a garden.
<P>

	(e) Painting and stripping wallpaper.
<P>

81	There is no detail of the amount of time spent and accordingly one can only
gather this from the evidence of others such as,
Adrian, who spoke of the work
occurring over the weekend period, normally on Saturdays so far as the
plaintiff was concerned.  There
is, of course, no evidence showing the what
effect that work had on the value of the property.  Clearly it was of
assistance but
it is very difficult for a Court to judge on the limited
evidence the value of such assistance 
<P>

82	Household contributions.  I have earlier referred to these and it seems that
there is very little in the way of household contributions
given that there is
a sharing of these.  Even if one accepts the plaintiff on doing washing there
is still not a substantial amount
to take into account.
<P>

83	So far as household expenses are concerned, it seems clear on the evidence
of the plaintiff that while they were at Haberfield
the defendant paid all the
household bills and paid for the shopping with the plaintiff purchasing her own
personal items.
<P>

84	I return to the question of the payment of wages of $300 a week instead of
the award rate.  The award subsequently changed on
21 January 1994 to $421 for
a Grade 1 clerk and 20 April 1995 to $429.  The comments I have earlier made in
respect of the earlier
period when the plaintiff was receiving cash only rather
than some money on which tax was being deducted apply again but with not
the
same force because it is clear she was paying some tax and only receiving part
of it on a tax free basis.  
<P>

85	The period from December 1992 until July 1995 is 2-1/2 years at $120 per
week the short payment is likely to be in the order
of $15,600 gross.  On a net
basis after allowing the benefit of cash the short payment is $5,980.
<P>

86	I turn to the question of the additional assistance at work.  I have earlier
referred to this evidence when the plaintiff said
that during the last two
years she was spending up to seven days a week at the business.  Apart from
secretarial and bookkeeping
work she became a principal salesperson and helped
with upholstery including selecting, ordering, cutting and sewing.  She also
alleges
she did other jobs such as cleaning, helping feed timber into machinery
and stacking timber.
<P>

87	There was evidence to suggest that during this period the value of the
defendant's business was declining.  He continually increased
his overdraft as
he made more losses.  At the relevant time which was from 1993 to 1995 the
business was reduced to two people, namely,
the parties.  For this reason I am
inclined to believe the plaintiff on this point.  Once again it is hard to
judge the amount to
which they should be recognised because of the paucity of
the evidence.  
<P>

88	When considering how these contributions should be recognised I bear in mind
again, of course, the relevant periods which were
as follows:-
<P>

November 1984 to September 1986   22 months
<P>

December 1990 to April 1992       16 months
<P>

December 1992 to 1 July 1995      2-1/2 years
<P>

89	Having regard to the whole of the evidence some of which I have referred to
in this judgment and the contributions which are
alleged I think the
appropriate order is that the defendant pay to the plaintiff $50,000 by way of
adjustment to the parties' property
interests.
<P>

90	I direct the parties bring in short minutes to reflect any other necessary
orders and I will hear argument on costs.
