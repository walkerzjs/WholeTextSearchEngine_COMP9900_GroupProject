<P>

<b>4737/99 - OLIVER DAMBERG v WILFREID DAMBERG &amp; BRUENHILD DAMBERG &amp; 1
OR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Ex tempore;  revised 9 December 1999)</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  These are two applications by summons for equivalent
relief on equivalent evidence.  The plaintiff in proceedings
No. 4736/99 is
Nicole Damberg and the plaintiff in proceedings No. 4737/99 is Oliver Damberg.
They are the adult children of the
defendants Wilfried and Bruenhild Damberg.
The relief which is sought is a declaration pursuant to ss 10 and 11 of the<b>
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Federal Courts (State Jurisdiction) Act 1999</a> (NSW) (`the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>') that an
ineffective judgment of the Family Court of Australia made by Purdy J on 4 June
1999, which purported to enter judgment
in favour of the two plaintiffs before
me, is a valid judgment of Supreme Court of New South Wales.
<P>

2  	At the hearing today the plaintiffs sought final relief in terms
of the summonses and the defendants opposed that relief on
two grounds.  First,
the defendants said that a declaration in the terms sought was inappropriate;
and secondly, they said that any
application for relief under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> should be
brought in proceedings in the Common Law Division of this Court No 12244/99.
<P>

3  	The issues before me arose out of a judgment of Purdy J in the
Family Court of Australia delivered on 4 June 1999 as a final
judgment after a
15 day hearing.  The case before his Honour involved claims by the two
plaintiffs against their parents (`the children's
claims') and also an
allocation between the defendant parents pursuant to s 79 of the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Law Act 1975</a> (Cth) of the property remaining after determination of the
children's claims.
<P>

4  	The children's claims asserted some complicated factual
circumstances dealt with in his Honour's judgment, but essentially they
are
property claims with which this Court has jurisdiction to deal.  The claims
fall within the definition of `State matter' in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 3</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> because they
relate (inter alia) to property in New South Wales, and this Court has
jurisdiction to deal with them by reason of the
law of this State.  The claims
were cross-vested to the Family Court by orders of this Court so they could be
heard and determined
together with the claims of the husband and wife for an
allocation of property under s 79.
<P>

5  	The decision of the High Court of Australia in<b> </b><i>Re
Wakim</i><b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/27.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] HCA 27</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20163%20ALR%20270" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 163 ALR 270</a> was handed down after Purdy J delivered his
judgment.  The parties before me proceed on the view, which appears ex facie to
be correct,
that<b> </b><i>Re Wakim</i><b> </b>has the consequence that the
Family Court did not have jurisdiction to make orders with respect to the
children's claims.  It has
not been contended before me that the Family Court
had any accrued jurisdiction to deal with those claims in conjunction with the
s 79 claim.  I was informed from the bar table that Purdy J has subsequently
made an order falling within the definition of `relevant
order' in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11(1)</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, though I have no direct evidence of this.  I was also informed from
the bar table that appeals have been lodged to the Court of
Appeal of this
Court and the Full Court of the Family Court of Australia with respect to Purdy
J's judgment, the former appeal relating
to the children's claims and the
latter appeal relating to the s 79 claim.
<P>

6  	The plaintiffs wish to obtain two further kinds of relief.
First, they say that in consequence of Purdy J's judgment they are
entitled to
an order for costs and they seek to pursue that entitlement against their
father but not against their mother.  For that
purpose they have instituted the
proceedings in the Common Law Division of this Court to which I have referred,
namely No. 12244/99.
 Secondly, the plaintiffs wish to put themselves in a
position to enforce Purdy J's judgment, subject of course to any stay related
to the appeals.  It was in pursuit of the latter purpose that the proceedings
now before me were instituted.
<P>

7  	The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, which commenced on 9 July 1999, contains provisions
which are relevant to the above circumstances.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4(1)</a> defines
`ineffective judgment' as follows:
<P>

`A reference in this <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> to an <b><i>ineffective judgment</i></b> is a
reference to a judgment of a federal court in a State matter given or recorded,
before the commencement of this section, in
the purported exercise of
jurisdiction purporting to have been conferred on the federal court by a
relevant State <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.'
<P>

The word `judgment' is defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 3</a> to include a judgment, decree or order,
whether final or interlocutory.  Purdy J's judgment of 4 June 1999, so far as
it relates
to the children's claims, is a judgment of a federal court in a
State matter given before the commencement of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> on 9 July 1999, in the
purported exercise of jurisdiction purporting to have been conferred by a
relevant State <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, namely the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/joca1987427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987</a>
(NSW).  It follow that Purdy J's judgment is an `ineffective judgment' within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
4(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.  
<P>

8  	That being so, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a> declares that the rights and liabilities of
all persons are the same as if Purdy J's ineffective judgment had been a valid
judgment
of the Supreme Court in a Division constituted by a judge of this
Court.  By <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> a right or liability conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a> is exercisable or
enforceable as if it were a right or liability conferred by a judge of the
Supreme Court.  By <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 10</a> the Supreme Court is empowered to vary, revoke, set
aside, revive or suspend a right or liability conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6.</a>  The group of
provisions which I have just described applies whenever there is an
`ineffective judgment' as defined.  The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> contemplates, therefore, that
remedial consequences flow under it in respect of certain prior judgments of
federal courts which are
invalid in consequence of<b> </b><i>Re Wakim</i>.
Those consequences do not flow on the basis that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> validates the
ineffective judgment;  they flow on the basis that the ineffective judgment is
treated as a judgment of the Supreme
Court.
<P>

9  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 11</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> is directed to a different though
overlapping situation.  It applies in a case where there is a `relevant order'.
That expression
is defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11(1).</a>  Approximately speaking, a relevant
order is an order of a federal court, whether made before or after the
commencement of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> on 9 July 1999, acknowledging in some way that it does
not have jurisdiction to hear and determine a proceeding which is before it
relating to a State matter.  Where a relevant order has been made, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11(2)</a>
empowers a party to the federal court proceeding to apply to the Supreme Court
for an order that the proceeding be treated as a proceeding
of the Supreme
Court.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 11</a> obviously has potential application in a case where there is
a proceeding in a federal court such as the Family Court of Australia
which has
not yet proceeded to judgment of any kind.  It also has potential application
in a case where a  judgment, interlocutory
or final, has been delivered and
orders have been made in the federal court, but some additional relief is
sought and the federal
court determines that it lacks jurisdiction to grant the
additional relief. Thus, if a final judgment in a federal court proceeding
has
been delivered but the federal court has not made an order with respect to
costs, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11</a> is potentially available to permit the party seeking costs to
obtain an order of the Supreme Court that the proceeding be treated
as a
proceeding of the Supreme Court, and then to seek an order for costs in the
Supreme Court.  Proceedings for that purpose are
brought by summons under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/index.html#p77" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 77</a>
r 141 of the Supreme Court Rules.
<P>

10  	However, s 11 is not the only vehicle by which rights which have
been at issue in a federal court proceeding may be asserted
or defended in the
Supreme Court.  Section 7 expressly contemplates the enforcement of the rights
established by s 6 with respect
to an ineffective judgment.  Those rights,
according to s 7, are enforceable as if they were conferred by a judgment of
the Supreme
Court.  It follows that the procedural machinery of the Supreme
Court should be made available for enforcement of those rights. 
In fact, it is
made available under Pt 77 r 139 of the Supreme Court Rules.
<P>

11  	Equally, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 10</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, by conferring on the Supreme Court the
power to alter the rights conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a> as if they were rights conferred by
the Supreme Court, implies that the procedural machinery of the Supreme Court
should be made
available so that such an alteration may occur in a proper case.
Consequently, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/index.html#p77" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 77</a> r 140 of the Supreme Court Rules provides for an
application for an order under s 10.  
<P>

12  	There are, in summary, three provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> which create
bases for relief in the Supreme Court, namely <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 11(2)</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">7</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">10</a>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section
11(2)</a> is available where there is `a relevant order', whether or not there is
an `ineffective judgment'.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 7</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">10</a> are available where there is an
`ineffective judgment', whether or not there is a relevant order.
<P>

13  	The summonses in the two cases before me seek declarations
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 10</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">11</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.  It appears to me that a declaration
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 10</a> is inappropriate here, since the plaintiffs do not wish to
obtain an order of the Supreme Court altering rights or liabilities flowing
from the ineffective judgment of Purdy J.  Instead they seek to put themselves
in a position to enforce Purdy J's judgment.  As far
as <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11</a> is concerned, the
appropriate relief would be an order that the proceeding in the Family Court be
treated as a proceeding of the
Supreme Court, rather than relief by way of
declaration of right.  Consequently, in my opinion, the prayer for relief in
the summons
is inaccurately framed.
<P>

14  	In my opinion, a declaration could be made in an appropriate
case with respect to the rights conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a> or the enforceability of those
rights under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a>, but in accordance with well-established principles a
declaration of right should not be made unless there is a genuine dispute which
is not merely hypothetical.  In the present case the defendants acknowledge
that the judgment of Purdy J with respect to the children's
claims is an
`ineffective judgment', and that under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a> the rights and liabilities of all
persons are declared to be the same as if Purdy J's judgment had been a valid
judgment of the Supreme
Court.  Therefore, there is no dispute which needs to
be resolved by declaration of right.  
<P>

15  	If the plaintiffs wish to enforce the rights conferred on them
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a>, they may proceed by summons under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/index.html#p77" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 77</a> r 139 seeking the
enforcement relief which they wish to obtain.  Obviously an application under
those provisions would be premature
if no enforcement relief were in
contemplation.
<P>

16  	In my opinion, therefore, the relief sought in the summons ought
not to be granted in its present form.  The question arises
whether, if the
plaintiffs were to make an application, I should allow an amendment to the
summons to permit them to seek relief
consistent with these reasons for
judgment.  In my opinion I ought not to do so.  This is because of the
undesirability of this Court
taking steps which would encourage or permit
multiplicity of proceedings.
<P>

17  	As I have mentioned, there is a proceeding in the Common Law
Division of this Court at the present time.  The parties to that
proceeding are
the same as the parties in the two sets of proceedings before me when taken
together.  The relief sought is an order
that the first defendant (the father)
pay the children's costs of the Family Law proceedings.  I am not sure of the
basis upon which
this Court has jurisdiction to make the order sought in the
Common Law proceedings, nor (if it does) whether it would ever be appropriate
for this Court to exercise its discretion to award costs consequent upon a
judgment in another court.  I say no more about that.
 But it does seem to me
that a litigant in proceedings in a federal court in which an ineffective
judgment has been given which did
not deal with costs, is able to apply by
summons under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/index.html#p77" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 77</a> r 141 for an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> that the
proceeding in the federal court be treated as a proceeding in the Supreme Court
of New South Wales, provided that
<P>

(i)	a `relevant order' has been made in the federal court;  and
<P>

(ii)	the proceeding relates to a State matter of New South Wales.
<P>

18  	I am less sure whether it would be possible to apply directly
for an order for costs under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/index.html#p77" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 77</a> r 139 in reliance on the contention that
such an order relates to the enforcement of rights under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7.</a>  But in any event
an application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11(2)</a> could be accompanied by a consequential
application for an order for costs on the assumption that the order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
11(2)</a> is first made.
<P>

19  	Thus the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> provides a mechanism for a person in the position
of the present plaintiffs to move the proceedings in the federal court forward
by seeking an order for costs in this Court, provided that the requirements of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> are satisfied.  If the requirements of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> are satisfied it will
incidentally follow that there will be a proceeding of an appropriate kind in
this Court so that in future,
should it be necessary to seek enforcement,
enforcement will be available in that proceeding.  That is to say, if an order
is made
in the Common Law proceeding that the Family Court proceeding be
treated as a proceeding of this Court, then an appropriate application
for
enforcement of Purdy J's orders can be made in the Common Law proceeding,
whether or not the Court in that proceeding makes the
order for costs.
Bringing all relevant applications in the Common Law proceeding would avoid
multiplicity of actions.
<P>

20  	I note that under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/index.html#p77" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 77</a> r 139-141 of the Supreme Court Rules it
is contemplated that a proceeding under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> will be brought in the Division
to which the federal court proceeding would have been assigned had it been
commenced in this Court.
 That may suggest that in the normal course an order
with respect to Family Court proceedings would be sought by application to the
Equity Division rather than the Common Law Division.  However, since there is
an existing proceeding in the Common Law Division it
seems to me that if an
application were to be made in the Common Law proceeding for leave to file an
amended summons seeking relief
under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, considerations of convenience
would justify waiver of that part of the Rule. 
<P>

21  	In my opinion, therefore, the present two summonses should be
dismissed and the plaintiffs in the present proceedings should
consider whether
to seek leave to amend the Common Law proceedings in the manner outlined.
<P>

22  	On the question of costs, counsel for the defendants submit
forcefully that there is no basis here for departing from the normal
rule that
costs should follow the event.  In the very special circumstances of this case
I disagree.  It appears not only that there
has been considerable confusion
with respect to the procedural operation of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fcja1999354/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, but the legal
representatives of the plaintiffs have framed their proceedings after
discussions with staff of this Court.  I have
delivered full reasons for
judgment notwithstanding that the matter has arisen in a very busy duty list,
precisely because of the
lack of clarity in this area and in the hope of saving
future litigants from the confusion which operated in this case.  I believe
the
appropriate result is that I should make no order for costs in respect of the
two proceedings which are before me today. 
<P>

23  	I order that the summons in each of proceeding No. 4736 of 1999
and proceeding No. 4737 of 1999 be dismissed with no order
as to costs.
