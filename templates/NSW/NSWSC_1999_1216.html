<b>002227/99 -  MARJORIE JEAN SANDERS &amp; ORS  v  STEVEN VALTAS -  ESTATE OF
SHIRLEY DELEPHINE McKENZIE</b>
<P>

 
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

 
<P>

1  	MASTER:  This is an application under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> in
respect of the estate of the late Shirley Delephine McKenzie who died on 25
December 1998.
<P>

2  	     The deceased was survived by her three children, Marjorie
Jean Saunders, Debra Kay Jones and Russell Phillip McKenzie.
<P>

3  	     The deceased made her last Will and testament on 8 April
1997.  She appointed the defendant her executor.  She left her
estate to the
First Church of Christ Scientists, 175 Huntington Avenue, Boston, USA.
<P>

4  	     At the same time the deceased executed a statutory
declaration in which she indicated her reasons for not leaving the estate
to
her children.  In respect of her son Russell and her daughter Marjorie she said
that she did not want to give them her estate
because they had drifted away
from her for many years and no longer treated her as a mother.  In respect of
her daughter Debra she
referred to a letter of 12 December 1996 that Debra had
written to her and her own reply and indicated that given the matters in
her
reply in that letter she had deliberately left Debra out of the Will.
<P>

5  	     The deceased left a house property at 123 Carpenter Street,
St Marys.  This property was sold for $123,000. There was a
Commonwealth bank
account with a credit of $7,708.  The account was accessed by the plaintiff
Debra who had her mother's power of
attorney.  Those funds were to treat debts
and funeral expenses and has been accounted for except for some $350 odd.
<P>

6  	     The distributable estate now totals $112,962.  From this
there will be costs to be deducted.  The defendant's costs amount
to $10,110
and on the estimate provided by the defendant's solicitor by affidavit it is a
proper amount for a small estate.  The
plaintiff's costs are estimated at some
$25,000 and this estimate is simply nothing more than that. It would be
surprising, given
the shortness  of the affidavit, that they might amount to
that.  In any event, there will be some costs if an order is made in favour
of
the plaintiffs.  That will be dealt with in the assessment in due course.
<P>

7  	     I will give some short details of the chronology of the
matter.
<P>

8  	     The son Russell was born on 14 April 1948.  Marjorie was
born on 8 March 1950.  Debra was born on 3 April 1958.  Their
father, Phillip
Leslie McKenzie, died in 1960.  Prior to that  he had been in the Australian
Army and had been posted to many stations
in Australia to which the family
travelled.
<P>

9  	     In 1963 Russell left school and obtained an apprenticeship
at Garden Island.
<P>

10  	     In 1965 Marjorie left home at the age of 15 years.  She at
that stage had a disagreement with her mother.  Russell joined
the Air Force
and served in the Air Force for many years, including Vietnam.
<P>

11  	     In 1971 he was discharged and commenced to live with the
deceased again.  He remained there for some two or three years.
 He then moved
into rented accommodation.
<P>

12  	     In 1976 Debra moved away from home.  Thereafter the
children lived their lives, the detail of which is not critical to
the present
matter.
<P>

13  	     Russell last seems to have worked in 1989 and moved to
Ballina and married in 1990.  In April 1991 he received the TPI
pension.
<P>

14  	     Debra married her present husband in 1992 and Marjorie
married her present husband in 1994.
<P>

15  	     It was in 1994 that Debra and Andrew moved to Leichhardt
and subsequently they went to Earlwood.  They were not too far
from the
deceased.
<P>

16  	     The deceased's last Will was made on 8 April 1997, as I
have said. Towards the end of 1998 her health declined and was
in Mount Druitt
Hospital in October and thereafter transferred to various nursing homes before
she died on 25 December 1998.
<P>

17  	     In applications under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> the High
Court in<b> Singer v Berghouse</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a> set out the two stage
approach that a Court must take.  At page 209 it said the following:
<P>

"The first question is, was the provision (if any) made for the applicant
'inadequate for (his or her) proper maintenance, education
and advancement in
life'?  The difference between 'adequate' and 'proper' and the
interrelationship which exists between 'adequate
provision' and 'proper
maintenance' etc were explained in<b> Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited</b>.
The determination of the first stage in the two-stage process calls for an
assessment of whether the provision (if any) made was
inadequate or what, in
all the circumstances, was the proper level of maintenance etc appropriate for
the applicant having regard,
amongst other things, to the applicant's financial
position, the size and nature of the deceased's estate, the totality of the
relationship
between the applicant and the deceased, and the relationship
between the deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims upon
his or
her bounty.
<P>

 
<P>

The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves similar
considerations.  Indeed, in the first stage of the process,
the court may need
to arrive at an assessment of what is the proper level of maintenance and what
is adequate provision, in which
event, if it becomes necessary to embark upon
the second stage of the process, that assessment will largely determine the
order which
should be made in favour of the applicant.  In saying that, we are
mindful that there may be some circumstances in which a court
could refuse to
make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to have been left
without adequate  provision for proper
maintenance.  Take, for example, a case
like<b> Ellis v Leeder</b> where there were no assets from which an order could
reasonably be made and making an order could disturb the testator's
arrangements
to pay creditors."
<P>

18  		As indicated by the High Court it is necessary to consider the
situation of the individual plaintiffs.
<P>

19  	     The plaintiff, Marjorie Sanders, is aged 49 years and
married with three adult children.  Her husband is 54 years of age
and in work
earning some modest wage.  Their assets are not substantial.  They have a small
amount in a bank account, a 1983 Corona
sedan worth $2,500, household furniture
and effects and interest in superannuation funds totalling $19,000 which cannot
be accessed
while working. They owe their daughter $1,500.
<P>

20  	     It is necessary to consider their relationship with their
mother.  One of the matters that has intruded into the relationship
is the fact
that the deceased was a Christian Scientist and adhered to that religion.  Her
children did not and this obviously produced
difficulties in the relationship
between the deceased and the various plaintiffs. Notwithstanding this there was
contact between
Marjorie and the deceased until shortly prior to mid 1998.  At
that stage the deceased had become somewhat ill and it was necessary
for her to
be looked after.  Clearly that was something which she did not appreciate but,
in any event, I am satisfied that following
discussion with both Marjorie and
Debra there was an arrangement for Marjorie and her husband to give up their
accommodation and
to move in and live there with the mother. After being there
for about two weeks the deceased accused Marjorie's husband of telling
lies
about Marjorie and it transpired that in fact the deceased thought that the
house was being taken over by Marjorie.  Marjorie
and her husband's furniture
and effects were in the deceased's house because they had moved. The
conversation progressed and, according
to Marjorie, the deceased then decided
she did not want her daughter there and she should move out.  So after this
effort on their
part to come, live and thus look after her mother they were
told to go and they did so.  What Marjorie did was to keep in touch through
her
sister Debra.
<P>

21  	     I turn to the situation of Debra.  She is 41 and married.
She works as an Office Administrator earning $35,000 per annum.
 Her husband
Andrew works as a printer and they live in rented accommodation.  Their assets
are also fairly minimal on current standards.
 They have household contents of
$25,000, two cars worth $12,000 in all, a motor cycle worth $2,000 and a very
small amount in the
bank.  They also have liabilities of $20,100.
<P>

22  	     The contact that Debra had with her mother continued
throughout their lives.  This is evidenced because in both 1994 and
1996 the
deceased left Wills in which Debra was her only beneficiary.  That led to
estrangement between Debra and her mother.  This
event occurred latter on in
1996.
<P>

23  	     In the August the deceased had an operation for removal of
some cancerous growth and Debra made an offer for her and Andrew
to move in
with her.  There was discussion of an extension to the home and both Debra and
her husband made extensive enquiries about
the costs of such an exercise
including the obtaining of quotes.  After all this effort had  been put into
that exercise and also
the time that Debra had spent in looking after her
mother and taking her for doctors appointments, the change of heart that then
emerged caused a rupture.  In effect the deceased changed her mind and told her
daughter she did not want Debra to move in and said
God would provide for
her.
<P>

24  	     This seemed to indicate to the plaintiff that once she was
well again she was quite happy to go her own way and caring
little about the
efforts her daughter and son-in-law had spent in trying to help her.
<P>

25  	     This resulted in the letter in which the plaintiff, Debra,
was critical of her mother and her approach to life in general.
 She indicated
she did not want to have anything more to do with her mother and did not want
any of her money. The interesting thing
that this illustrates is the problem
that older people have when they need assistance.  They do not necessarily want
to accept that
assistance.
<P>

26  	     After Marjorie moved out from home it was to Debra to whom
the deceased turned once her health failed again. Notwithstanding
the break
that had occurred Debra continued to assist her mother in the period up until
her mother's death.
<P>

27  	     I turn now to the situation of Phillip.  He is, as I have
indicated, 51 years of age, married without dependants.
<P>

28  	They have a car worth $6,500, minimal savings, a liability of
$9,700 and he receives a TPI pension.  His wife receives a service
pension,
which pension totals $1,240 per fortnight. They live in rented accommodation
and both of them have some difficulty with
their medical condition.
<P>

29  	     It seems there was a relationship between the plaintiff
Phillip and his mother.  Towards the end of his mother's life
he seems to have
lost touch with her, last having seen her in 1997.  He said he had no knowledge
of the illness of the deceased or
in fact her death, only being informed a few
weeks after the death.  In the last few years he has been in ill health and has
been
in hospital on numerous occasions.
<P>

30  	     It is apparent from all of this that one of the points of
difficulty between the deceased and her children is the difference
that they
have over her religious beliefs.  It is clear from the evidence, which the
children gave frankly, that they accept that
their mother was sincere in that
faith.
<P>

31  	     The difficulty is, of course, the way the deceased reacted
to her children in not following the faith that she had adopted.
 Clearly the
children raised with the deceased or the deceased raised with them this
difference in their approach.  Although this
matter is slightly different the
following comments of Holland J in<b> Kleinig v Neal </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%202%20NSWLR%20532" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 2 NSWLR 532</a> at
540 are apposite:
<P>

"If it is a case of parent and child, another circumstance is that the parent
was responsible for bringing the child into the world
and having done so
assumed a duty to be concerned with the child's welfare.  A wise parent will
recognise that perfect harmony between
parent and child is in the nature of
things not to be looked for and that, coming to adulthood, a child will want to
make his own
life just as the parent had done before him.  Differences of
outlook between different generations is not exceptional, it is the
general
rule, so some friction between parent and child or disappointment in a parent's
hopes and expectations concerning his child
will be accepted by the wise parent
as almost inevitable.  If it occurs, the parent who is just as well as wise
will not allow such
disharmony or disappointment to blind him to the needs of
his child for maintenance, education or advancement in life.  The duty
of a
parent towards his child to provide for those needs on his death, if he can,
continues in spite of such disharmony or disappointment
and the statute obliges
the court to consider whether it has been performed.  The court must take in
the whole scene and make the
 judgment that it considers that a wise and just
parent would have made in the circumstances. Of course, as the statute
provides,
if the court considers that the character or conduct of the child has
been such as to disentitle the child to any or any further
benefit from the
parent, it may refuse the child's claim."
<P>

32  	     In this case although there were the disagreements in my
view the conduct of the children is not disentitling conduct
and not such, in
my view, as should reduce the claim which they have on the bounty of the
testator.  In one case, and I think it
was with Russell, he conceded there was
some drifting apart and that may be so.  However, in the end I am not critical
of lack of
contact during the period.
<P>

33  	     All of the children have some debts, some more than others.
None of them is in a strong asset position and they exist
on their wages which
they earn.  It is probably not possible for them to aspire to obtaining a
house.
<P>

34  	     Accordingly, the basis on which they have been left without
proper and adequate provision for maintenance and education
in life is put
forward on the need for some sum to provide them with a start and something to
pay their debts and give them provision
for their assistance.
<P>

35  	     The deceased, as I have said, was committed to her
religion.  There no evidence of contact with a particular church nor
evidence
led by the defendant of the deceased's association or importantly assistance
from the church during her lifetime.  She had
the benefit of her faith but
there does not seem to be any particular thing, apart from this, which the
church as provided to her.
 By this I mean in terms of material support and
assistance.  No doubt her faith was important to the deceased during her
lifetime.
<P>

36  	     Given the smallness of the estate after costs no basis
would be served by differentiating between the plaintiffs. It seems
to me that
in a small estate it is appropriate for it to be shared between the three
plaintiffs equally.
<P>

37  	     Accordingly, I order:
<P>

1.   That the whole of the estate of deceased to be divided between the three
plaintiffs equally.
<P>

2.   The defendant's costs on the indemnity basis and the plaintiff's on a
party and party basis to be paid or retained out of the
estate of the
deceased.
