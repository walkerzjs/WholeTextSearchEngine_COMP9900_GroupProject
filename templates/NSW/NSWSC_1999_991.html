<b>3968/99 - PATRICK CLEARY &amp; ANOR  V  AUSTRALIAN CO-OPERATIVE FOODS
LIMITED (NO.2)</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Delivered 12 October 1999 and revised on 13 October 1999)</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  
<P>

<b>The Restructure Proposal</b>
<P>

1  	In proceedings 2882/99 the first defendant (which I shall call
`Dairy Farmers') sought orders for the convening of a meeting
of the holders of
co-operative capital units called `Members' Capital Units' or `MCUs' to
consider a scheme of arrangement.  The
scheme was part of a larger proposal by
Dairy Farmers to its members and MCU holders (`the Restructure Proposal') which
also involved
a postal ballot by the members to consider two special
resolutions, namely resolutions for the approval of a scheme of arrangement
between them and Dairy Farmers and for the registration of Dairy Farmers as a
company under the Corporations Law within the next
three years.  The scheme
between Dairy Farmers and MCU holders is an arrangement for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1992157/s344.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
344(1)(a)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1992157/" class="autolink_findacts">Co-operatives Act 1992</a> (NSW) (`the Act'), as the MCU holders
are creditors for that purpose.  The scheme between Dairy Farmers and its
members is an arrangement
for the purposes of s 344(1)(b), and the procedure
for approval of a transfer of incorporation is set out in s 316.  In
conjunction
with the schemes and approval of transfer of incorporation, Dairy
Farmers proposes that a meeting of members be held to approve rule
amendments
and to make other decisions necessary for the implementation of the Restructure
Proposal.
<P>

2  	The purpose of the Restructure Proposal is to permit funding
flexibility which would strengthen the competitive position of
Dairy Farmers in
the market place for its products.  It has been developed after extensive
consultation between management and members,
which has included meetings at
district and `ward' level in New South Wales and other States where the members
are located.  Under
Stage I of the Restructure Proposal a new co-operative
referred to as the `Supply Co-operative' would be interposed between the
members
and MCU holders and Dairy Farmers, by the cancellation of 75% of their
shares and MCUs in exchange for 100% ownership of the Supply
Co-operative.  The
Supply Co-operative would in turn hold 75% of the shares in Dairy Farmers.  The
farmer members would thereafter
supply their milk to the Supply Co-operative,
and Dairy Farmers would then acquire the milk from the Supply Co-operative for
processing
and selling purposes under a new milk supply agreement.  Stage II
would involve the conversion of Dairy Farmers from a co-operative
to a company
registered under the Corporations Law, at a time decided by the directors
within three years from the date of implementation
of Stage I.  Conversion
would facilitate the raising of external capital and would permit Dairy Farmers
to list on the Stock Exchange,
although the Supply Co-operative would retain a
controlling interest (but not necessarily a majority interest).
<P>

3  	On 30 July 1999 I made orders for the convening of a meeting of
MCU holders, directing that two volumes of explanatory materials
entitled `the
Restructure Booklet' be sent to them.  The Restructure Booklet also made
disclosure to the members for the purposes
of their postal ballot and meeting.
It was dated 5 August 1999 and was sent to members and MCU holders shortly
thereafter.  The closing
date for the postal ballot was originally fixed as 15
September 1999 and the meetings were scheduled to occur on that day.  
<P>

<b>The Parmalat Proposal</b>
<P>

4  	As was pointed out in the Restructure Booklet, Parmalat
Finanziaria S.p.A. (`Parmalat') through its Australian subsidiaries
(including
Pauls Ltd) is one the two main competitors of Dairy Farmers, the other being
National Foods.  Paragraph 5.9 of Volume
I of the Restructure Booklet draws
attention to the competitive position and notes that both competitors have the
flexibility to
make large capital raisings, a flexibility which Dairy Farmers
does not presently possess but would obtain through the Restructure
Proposal.
A further reference to the competitive positions of Dairy Farmers and Parmalat
may be found in paragraph 4.2 of Volume
II.  Notwithstanding that they are
competitors, the managing director of Dairy Farmers, Mr Tooth, and its
chairman, Mr Langdon, had
discussions with representatives of Parmalat prior to
the application by Dairy Farmers in proceedings 2882/99.  In those discussions
Parmalat proposed a transaction under which it would acquire a controlling
interest in Dairy Farmers.  Given that Parmalat was a
competitor seeking to
acquire control, and that an important component of the Restructure Proposal
was that a farmer-owned co-operative
would retain a controlling interest in
Dairy Farmers, one can infer that Parmalat's proposal was not welcomed by Dairy
Farmers' management
at the time.  However, the discussions continued until
Parmalat transmitted to Dairy Farmers a letter and annexures dated 31 August
1999 which set out a specific proposal for Parmalat to acquire a controlling
interest in Dairy Farmers (`Parmalat Proposal').  The
ingredients of the
Parmalat Proposal included the following:
<P>

(i)	the merger would be effected by the sale of Pauls Ltd to Dairy Farmers in
consideration of the issue of approximately 107 million
shares by Dairy
Farmers;
<P>

(ii)	an enterprise value of $676 million was placed on Dairy Farmers for the
purposes of the proposal and after deducting debt Parmalat
valued the equity in
Dairy Farmers at $471 million or $4.02 per share;
<P>

(iii)	the valuation of Dairy Farmers was derived by using a multiple of 13.5
times EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) for the
year to 30 June 1998;
<P>

(iv)	on the same basis Parmalat assessed the enterprise value of Pauls at $561
million and the equity in Pauls at $431 million;
<P>

(v)	Parmalat's proposal was to make a cash payment of $4.02 a share in respect
of a minimum of 25% of the Dairy Farmers shares held
by each of the members;
<P>

(vi)	a share sale facility would be established for the balance of Dairy
Farmers shares which would enable the members to sell shares
at $4.02 each
until 31 December 2000, and thereafter for a cash consideration calculated by
using a formula;
<P>

(vii)	a new Supply Co-operative would be formed with each farmer member being
eligible for membership and holding one share, and
the Supply Co-operative
would enter into a supply agreement with Dairy Farmers similar to the one
proposed in the Restructure Proposal;
<P>

(viii)	after the merger Parmalat would own a minimum 60.9% of the equity of the
merged entity.
<P>

5  	Two things are immediately evident.  First, whereas under the
Restructure Proposal a controlling interest in Dairy Farmers would
be retained
at both stages by the farmer-owned Supply Co-operative, the Parmalat Proposal
would entail that a controlling interest
in Dairy Farmers would be acquired by
Parmalat.  Secondly, the implementation of the Restructure Proposal would not
necessarily prevent
the Supply Co-operative and the other members of Dairy
Farmers from disposing of a controlling interest in Dairy Farmers at a later
stage, under some such proposal as the Parmalat Proposal.  The question whether
the implementation of the Restructure Proposal would
affect the prospects of
success of the Parmalat Proposal has been the subject of evidence and
submissions, and I shall return to
it. 
<P>

<b>The Board's response to the Parmalat Proposal</b>
<P>

6  	On 6 September 1999, following a board meeting on 3 September,
Dairy Farmers sent the Parmalat Proposal to its members and MCU
holders,
together with a letter from Mr Langdon (`Mr Langdon's Letter') and a document
headed `Australian Co-operative Foods Limited
Restructure Proposal to Continue
in the Best Interests of Members and MCU Holders' (`the Response').  Dairy
Farmers made a media
release on the same day (`the Media Release').  I shall
refer to Mr Langdon's Letter, the Response and the Media Release together
as
`the 6 September Materials' or `the Materials'.
<P>

7  	According to Mr Langdon's Letter, the Board had decided to
forward the Parmalat Proposal in its entirety `so that Members are
fully
informed'.  But instead of simply distributing the Parmalat Proposal, the Board
chose to comment on it in a disparaging way.
 The 6 September Materials confirm
that the Parmalat Proposal was unwelcome to the Board and management of Dairy
Farmers.  Their
tone is emotive, critical and negative.  Mr Langdon's Letter
characterises the Parmalat Proposal as one to `take control of the Dairy
Farmers Group away from its farmer Members', and after making specific
criticisms which are discussed below, the letter says:
<P>

`It is possible that the very public campaign against your Board will intensify
in the coming days and weeks.  It may become increasingly
personal in an
attempt to challenge the integrity of the Board, especially that of the
Chairman and CEO.  This type of propaganda
is an unfortunate tactic.
<P>

Dairy Farmers is a business with exciting commercial prospects.  Thus the
motivation to seize control is strong.  Hostile approaches
are not pleasant but
your Board will not be intimidated by them.'
<P>

These comments suggest an intensity of reaction on the part of the Board.  Read
as a whole, the 6 September Materials appear combative
and intemperate rather
than balanced and informative.  This overall impression needs to be borne in
mind when one turns, as I shall,
to the plaintiffs' specific complaints about
the Materials. 
<P>

8  	The 6 September Materials informed the members that the closing
date for the postal ballot would be extended to 23 September,
and the meetings
of members and MCU holders would be adjourned to 29 September 1999.  Members
and MCU holders would be given the
opportunity to request new ballot papers or
new proxy forms if they wished to change their previously lodged ballots or
proxy appointments,
and a procedure was set out.  The Materials stated that the
Board had decided to defer consideration of the Parmalat Proposal until
the
Restructure Proposal had been voted on and the members had been given the
opportunity to discuss the issue of `farmer control'.
 There would be a forum
discussion on the issue of `Farmer Control - a Prerequisite for the Future or
Not?' at the national meeting
of ward representatives on 2 November 1999 and
the members' convention on 3 November 1999.  
<P>

<b>The proceedings</b>
<P>

9  	The present proceedings were commenced on 14 September 1999.  The
plaintiffs are two dairy farmers who are members of Dairy
Farmers.  The
defendants are Dairy Farmers, its directors and the returning officer for the
postal ballot.  The plaintiffs contend
that the directors of Dairy Farmers have
breached their fiduciary duty, as well as their duty of disclosure to the
Court, by failing
to disclose their negotiations with Parmalat and by
misrepresenting various aspects of the Parmalat Proposal.  They say that Dairy
Farmers and its directors have failed to make adequate disclosure for the
purposes of the schemes of arrangement, contrary to the
requirements of ss 354
and 266 of the Act, the latter of which imports s 1022 of the Corporations Law.
They say that Dairy Farmers
and its directors have engaged in misleading and
deceptive conduct under one or more of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a>
(Cth), <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a> (NSW), s 12DA of the Australian
Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989 (Cth) and s 995 of the
Corporations Law.  Additionally,
they say that the procedure for replacement of
postal votes announced to the members on 6 September 1999 is not permitted by
law
and consequently the postal ballot is void and should be cancelled.  They
seek declarations on these matters, and orders restraining
the defendants from
proceeding with the postal ballot and the meetings.
<P>

10  	On 20 September 1999 the plaintiffs applied for an order for the
expedited final hearing of all or part of the proceedings.
 The defendants
applied for orders having the effect that the proceedings be heard concurrently
with the hearing of any motion to
approve the schemes of arrangement in
proceedings 2882/99.  In my judgment delivered ex tempore on 21 September 1999
and subsequently
revised (<i>Cleary v Australian Co-operative Foods</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/973.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999]
NSWSC 973)</a> I decided that it was appropriate to grant leave to the plaintiffs
to apply under Pt 31 of the Supreme Court Rules for the determination
of some
separate questions, and to expedite the hearing of that determination.  I stood
over the defendants' notice of motion for
further hearing after determination
of the separate questions, since my conclusion would not prevent that
application from succeeding
with respect to matters raised in the present
proceedings but not included in the separate questions for expedited
determination.
 As is clear from my reasons of 21 September 1999, my orders
assumed that the closing date for the postal ballot would be extended
again,
and the meetings would be further adjourned, for sufficient time to enable the
expedited hearing and determination of the
separate questions prior to the
closing of the ballot and prior to any consideration of matters of substance at
the meetings.  Eventually
Dairy Farmers decided that the closing date for the
ballot would be extended to 3 November 1999, the time of the annual convention,
and the meetings would be adjourned to be held at that time.
<P>

11  	My order for the determination of separate questions was as
follows:
<P>

`1.	Order that the following questions be determined pursuant to Pt 31 r 2
separately and before any other issue in the proceedings:
<P>

1.1	Whether the procedure set out in materials sent to members and MCU Holders
of the first defendant on or about 6 September 1999
with respect to the
retrieval of postal ballot papers and the casting of fresh votes is a lawful
procedure having regard to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1992157/" class="autolink_findacts">Co-operatives Act 1992</a>, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/cr1997248/" class="autolink_findacts">Co-operatives
Regulation 1997</a> Schedule 2 and the rules of the first defendant.
<P>

1.2	Whether the information supplied to members and MCU Holders of the first
defendant in the materials sent to them on or about
6 September 1999 and in the
press release of 6 September 1999 constitutes engaging by any defendant in
conduct which is misleading
or deceptive or involvement by any defendant in
such conduct for the purposes of any of the following Acts which may be
relevant,
namely:
<P>

(1)	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> (Cth);
<P>

(2)	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a> (NSW);
<P>

(3)	s 995 of the Corporations Law;
<P>

(4)	s 12DA of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989
(Cth).
<P>

1.3	If the answer to question 1.1 is no or 1.2 is yes, what relief should be
granted at this time?
<P>

1.4	Without limiting 1.3, if the answer to question 1.1 is no, can the court in
granting relief order the holding of a further postal
ballot of all or some of
the first defendant's members?
<P>

1.5	Without limiting 1.3, if the answer to 1.2 is yes, can the court in
granting relief order the dispatch of supplementary material
to the first
defendant's members?' 
<P>

12  	Broadly there are five issues arising out of these separate
questions, namely
<P>

&#183;	whether the postal ballot procedure, as altered by the 6 September
Materials, is lawful (`the Ballot Construction Issue');
<P>

&#183;	whether that procedure affects the secrecy of the process so as to
invalidate it (`the Secret Ballot Issue');
<P>

&#183;	whether the dispatch of the 6 September Materials amounted to engaging
in conduct which was misleading or deceptive or likely
to mislead or deceive
(`the Conduct Issue');
<P>

&#183;	identification of the statutory regime or regimes which govern the
determination of the Conduct Issue (`the Jurisdiction
Issue');
<P>

&#183;	identification of the most appropriate form of relief (`the Relief
Issue').
<P>

<b>The Ballot Construction Issue</b>
<P>

13  	The 6 September Materials set out a procedure for members to
change their votes in the postal ballot, and for members and MCU
holders to
change proxies which have already been lodged for the meetings.  There is no
challenge to the procedure so far as it related
to change of proxies, nor any
challenge to the power of Dairy Farmers to extend the closing date for the
postal ballot.  The procedure
for change of votes was as follows:
<P>

`<b>Change of vote ...</b>

14  	The first question is whether it is lawful, having regard to the
Act and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/cr1997248/" class="autolink_findacts">Co-operatives Regulation 1997</a> (`the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/cr1997248/" class="autolink_findacts">Regulation</a>') and the Rules of
Dairy Farmers, to permit members to change their vote in the postal ballot by
obtaining and submitting a new voting
paper which would cancel the previous
vote.  
<P>

15  	Voting is the subject matter of Part 8 of the Act.  Section 176
gives effect to the co-operative principle that `in primary
co-operatives
members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote)' (s 6), by providing
that the right to vote attaches to membership
rather than shareholding and that
each member has only one vote (subject to exceptions which are not presently
relevant).  Sections
188 and 189 set out the majorities required at a meeting
and in a postal ballot for the passing of an ordinary resolution and a special
resolution.  Section 190(2) states:
<P>

`A resolution is passed by a particular majority in a postal ballot if that
majority of the members of the co-operative who, being
entitled to do so, cast
formal votes in the postal ballot vote in favour of the resolution.'
<P>

16  	Sections 193 and 194 govern the conduct of postal ballots and
special postal ballots respectively.  Relevantly they provide:
<P>

`193(1)A postal ballot may be held as provided by the rules of a co-operative
and is to be conducted in accordance with the regulations.
 
<P>

(2)	On the declaration by the returning officer of the result of the ballot,
the secretary of the co-operative is to make an entry
in the minute book of the
co-operative showing:
<P>

(a)	the number of formal votes cast in favour of the proposal concerned, and
<P>

(b)	the number of formal votes cast against the proposal, and
<P>

(c)	the number of informal votes cast.'
<P>

`194(1)A special postal ballot is a postal ballot that is conducted as required
by this section.
<P>

(2)	The ballot must not be held less than 21 days after notice of the ballot is
given to members so as to enable sufficient time
for a meeting to discuss the
proposal that is the subject of the ballot to be convened and held (whether by
the Board or on the requisition
of members).
<P>

(3)	The co-operative must send to each member (along with any other material
required to be sent in connection with the postal ballot)
a disclosure
statement approved by the Registrar and containing information concerning:
<P>

(a)	the financial position of the co-operative, ...
<P>

(d)	such other matters as the Registrar directs.'
<P>

17  	The only provision of the Rules of Dairy Farmers dealing with
the conduct of postal ballots is Rule 36B, according to which
postal ballots
are to be conducted in the manner set out in Schedule 2 to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/cr1997248/" class="autolink_findacts">Co-operatives
Regulation 1997</a>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/cr1997248/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rule 30</a> states that at least 14 days notice must be given of
any meeting of members.  
<P>

18  	In my opinion s 193(1) provides a definition of `postal ballot'
for the purposes of the Act, and consequently a postal voting
procedure is
invalid unless it is authorised by the Regulation or the rules.  The provision
that a postal ballot `may be held as
provided by the rules' means that subject
to the Act and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/cr1997248/" class="autolink_findacts">Regulation</a>, an authorising rule is sufficient to permit a postal
voting procedure.  It does not mean or imply that a postal voting procedure
may
be authorised by some means other than by the Regulation or the rules.
Further, the obvious contrast between the provision that
the postal ballot `may
be held' as provided by the rules and the provision that the postal ballot `is
to be conducted' (ie, must
be conducted) in accordance with the regulations is
intended to make it clear that the regulations override the rules, rather than
to assert that while compliance with the regulations is mandatory, the rules
are merely directory.  Were the latter to be the case,
s 193(1) would be at
odds with the binding nature of the rules of a co-operative under s 106.
<P>

19  	Regulation 13 states that for the purposes of s 193, a postal
ballot must be conducted in accordance with Schedule 2.  Clause
1 of Schedule 2
empowers the board to cause the details of the proposal on which a ballot is to
be held to be set out in a statement,
and to fix dates for the forwarding of
ballots to members and the closing of the ballot, and to appoint a returning
officer for the
ballot.  Clause 3(5) requires the returning officer to send to
every member entitled to vote in the ballot a set of materials comprising
a
ballot paper, an `outer envelope' addressed to the returning officer, a `middle
envelope' on which the member's name and address
is to be printed, and an
`inner envelope' in which the ballot paper is to be enclosed.  Clauses 4 and 5
provide:
<P>

`4.	The returning officer may send a duplicate ballot paper to any voter if the
returning officer is satisfied:
<P>

(a)	that the voter has not received a ballot paper;  or
<P>

(b)	that the ballot paper received by the voter has been lost, spoilt or
destroyed and that the voter has not already voted.
<P>

5.	A member casts a vote in a ballot by:
<P>

(a)	completing the details on the reverse side of the middle envelope, and
<P>

(b)	marking his or her vote on the ballot paper according to the instructions
on the ballot paper, and 
<P>

(c)	sending the ballot paper, in the envelopes provided, to the returning
officer.'
<P>

20  	The returning officer is required by clause 6 to place the outer
envelopes in a locked ballot box not later than noon on the
date fixed for the
closing of the ballot.  As soon as practicable after noon on that date, the
returning officer must open the ballot
box and deal with the contents in the
manner specified by clause 7.  If a duplicate outer envelope has been issued
and the original
outer envelope is received, the returning officer must reject
the original envelope (clause 7(3)(b)).  After following prescribed
procedures
for checking and rejection of ballot papers, the returning officer must `count
all votes cast' (clause 8(1)).  
<P>

21  	Sections 190(2), 193 and 194 use the concept of `formal votes
cast', and clause 5 of Schedule 2 explains how a member casts
a vote in a
postal ballot, making it clear that the process of casting votes is completed
when the outer envelope is sent to the
returning officer.  However, it is not
correct that once the outer envelope is sent to the returning officer, the
voting process
has been exhausted once and for all and the voter is unable to
change the vote which has been cast in that manner.  Clause 7(3)(b)
contemplates that a vote may be changed, since it requires that the original
outer envelope must be rejected if it is received after
a duplicate outer
envelope has been issued.  Clause 7(3)(b) is not expressly confined to a case
where a duplicate ballot paper has
been issued under clause 4 and indeed, if
the returning officer is properly satisfied of the matters set out in clause 4
the original
outer envelope should not subsequently be received.  The breadth
of clause 7(3)(b) suggests that circumstances may arise in which
a duplicate
outer envelope is issued, other than those specified in clause 4.  That
suggestion is reinforced by clause 4 itself,
which merely says that the
returning officer `may send' a duplicate ballot paper in the circumstances
stated in the clause, without
expressly stating that these are the only
circumstances in which a duplicate ballot paper may be sent.  There are no
other such circumstances
set out in the Act or the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/cr1997248/" class="autolink_findacts">Regulation</a>, but s 193(1)
makes it plain that the requirements of the Regulation may be supplemented by
the rules of the co-operative, provided
that the rules are not inconsistent
with the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/cr1997248/" class="autolink_findacts">Regulation</a>.
<P>

22  	It therefore seems to me that a properly drafted rule of a
co-operative, provided that it is consistent with the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/cr1997248/" class="autolink_findacts">Regulation</a>, may authorise
the returning officer to send a duplicate ballot paper and envelopes to a voter
in circumstances other than those
set out in clause 4.  If the co-operative
issues a duplicate ballot paper and envelopes under such a rule then the
procedure which
clause 7(3)(b) prescribes for rejecting the original envelope
must be followed.  It would therefore have been open to Dairy Farmers
to adopt
a rule, prior to sending the 6 September Materials to its members, which would
have authorised the returning officer to
issue duplicate ballot papers and
envelopes, on the basis that if a duplicate outer envelope is issued to a
member and the original
outer envelope is received, the latter will be
rejected.  
<P>

23  	However, in my view the board of Dairy Farmers had no power
under the Act and Regulation to establish a procedure for change
of postal
votes in the absence of such a rule.  By requiring that a postal ballot be
conducted in accordance with Schedule 2 without
any supplement, the Rules of
Dairy Farmers made no provision for the issue of duplicate ballot papers and
envelopes in the circumstances
referred to in the 6 September Materials.
Section 193(1) left no room for the directors to adopt a procedure for the
issue of duplicate
ballot papers and envelopes going beyond what was authorised
by the Regulation and the Rules.  
<P>

24  	My conclusion, therefore, is that in the absence of an
authorising rule, the procedure adopted in the 6 September Materials
for
members to change their votes in the postal ballot was invalid.  
<P>

25  	This conclusion receives further support from s 107 and Schedule
I to the Act.  Section 107(1) requires that the rules of a
co-operative must
set out or make provision for the matters in Schedule I.  By item 22 of clause
1 of Schedule I, one of those matters
is `the method of conducting postal
ballots, including special postal ballots, including the sending and lodgment
of information
and votes by facsimile or electronic means.'  Thus, for example,
the rules could make provision, subject to s 183, for a person to
cast a
member's postal ballot under power of attorney.  And they could make provision,
subject to the requirements of the Act and
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/cr1997248/" class="autolink_findacts">Regulation</a>, for change of votes.
<P>

26  	The defendants' principal submission on this subject began with
the proposition, asserted in many cases including <i>Fraser v NRMA Holdings Ltd
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2055%20FCR%20452" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 55 FCR 452</a>, that directors of a corporation who seek the approval of
its members must provide such material information as will fully and fairly
inform the members of what is to be considered.  At least in the context of the
scheme of arrangement under the Corporations Law,
the directors' duty continues
until the members have taken their decision and the Court has approved it, in
the sense that they must
bring to the attention of the members and the Court
any change of circumstances which is material to the members' decision:  <i>Re
MB Group plc</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20BCLC%20672" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] BCLC 672</a>, 680;  <i>Re Jessel Trust Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20BCLC%20119" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] BCLC

of arrangement under Part 13 of the Act, having regard to s 368, according to
which the Court's
jurisdiction under Part 13 is intended to complement its
jurisdiction under the Corporations Law and should be exercised in harmony
with
that jurisdiction.
<P>

27  	I accept these propositions.  The defendant then says that
Schedule 2 must be construed in a manner which allows voters to
respond to
disclosure of a material change in circumstances.  The construction which I
have adopted allows the members, or the board
in the limited circumstances
referred to in s 112 of the Act, to adopt a rule which would permit a duplicate
ballot paper and envelopes
to be issued in the event that it becomes necessary
to sent supplementary disclosure materials to the members during the course of
a postal ballot.  Therefore this construction would allow voters to respond to
supplementary disclosure, provided that an authorising
rule is in place.  The
requirement for an authorising rule serves the useful purpose of allowing the
members to review the procedure
for a change of vote, because either the rule
will have been adopted by a special resolution of the members or it must be
disclosed
to the members under s 112(2) soon after it has been adopted by the
board (in event that the Registrar permits the board to adopt
the rule under s
112(1) (b)).  
<P>

<b>Did the 6 September Materials give the members sufficient time to change
their votes?</b>
<P>

28  	A supplementary point raised by the plaintiffs arises out of s
194(2).  That provision, which was extracted above, stipulates
that the ballot
must not be `held' less than 21 days after notice of the ballot is given to
members, so as to enable sufficient time
for a meeting to discuss the proposal.
The 6 September Materials stated that the closing date for the postal ballot
would be extended
to a date less than 21 days after the time when the Materials
would be received by members.  The plaintiffs say that this contravenes
s 194
(2).
<P>

29  	I disagree with this submission.  Section 194 (2) prescribes a
minimum period between the giving of notice of the ballot and
the holding of
the ballot.  The concept of <i>holding</i> a postal ballot is not defined, and
it is not entirely clear whether a ballot commences to be held when members
first have the opportunity
to vote, or is held only when the closing date
arrives.  But it is tolerably clear as a matter of construction that s 194(2)
is directed
only to the time between the initial notice of the ballot and its
holding, and does not apply to a notice of supplementary information
given
subsequently.  In its terms s 194(2) refers only to `notice of the ballot' and
to discussion of `the proposal that is the subject
of the ballot', and it would
be straining the language to extend it to a notice of new information and a
discussion of the effect
that the new information may have on a proposal
previously advanced.  
<P>

30  	The directors' obligation to disclose material new information
implies that the disclosure must be timely.  In any event the
Court would be
unlikely to exercise its discretion in favour of approving an arrangement which
has been affected by material new
information if the members had not had the
opportunity to consider and respond to it.  But in my opinion it was not
unreasonable
for Dairy Farmers to expect members to respond by 23 September to
materials sent to them on 6 September. 
<P>

<b>The Secret Ballot Issue</b>
<P>

31  	It will be seen that the procedure which the board had adopted
for change of postal votes required members who wished to change
their vote to
make a telephone call to obtain a new voting paper.  In following this
procedure, they would be required to identify
themselves so they could be sent
a new ballot paper and envelopes.  The original ballot paper and envelopes were
coloured pale blue,
whereas the replacements were coloured mauve.  
<P>

32  	The members of Dairy Farmers were sent a voting guide, which
included a pale blue postal ballot paper and envelopes, with the
Restructure
Booklet in August 1999.  In accordance with the procedures prescribed by
Schedule 2, members were asked to mark their
vote on the ballot paper, which
did not contain any information which could be used to identify the member,
then seal the ballot
paper inside the envelope marked `ballot paper' (which was
the inner envelope for the purposes of Schedule 2), and then seal the
inner
envelope inside a bigger envelope (the middle envelope) and complete the
outside of the middle envelope by filling in the member's
name and address and
signing it, and then seal the middle envelope in a larger envelope (the outer
envelope) which was pre-addressed
to the returning officer, and finally send
the outer envelope with its contents by reply paid post to the returning
officer.
<P>

33  	The returning officer gave evidence that when they were
received, the outer envelopes were date-stamped and placed in the locked
ballot
box.  He was the only person with a key to the ballot box.  Telephone calls for
replacement ballot papers were answered by
casual employees of Dairy Farmers,
who referred calls to the returning officer or the company secretary.  The
company secretary was
primarily responsible for responding to member queries on
Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays and the returning officer was primarily
responsible on Mondays and Tuesdays.
<P>

34  	After 6 September 1999 the returning officer began to receive a
small number of mauve outer envelopes, which he place in a
separate ballot box.
Members who requested a new ballot paper to replace one which they had lost or
filled out incorrectly would
be sent a new blue ballot paper and envelopes.
The returning officer kept a record of the names of all members who were sent a
new
blue ballot paper and envelopes, and the names of all members who were sent
a mauve ballot paper and envelopes.  No-one other than
the returning officer
and his personal assistant had access to that record.  As at 27 September 1999
50 mauve and 7 blue replacement
ballot papers and envelopes had been issued,
while 5097 voting guides were initially issued to active members.  
<P>

35  	The plaintiffs say that the change of vote procedure was
defective because it affected the secrecy of the process.  They assert
that the
procedure prescribed by clause 5 of Schedule 2, involving as it does the use of
multiple envelopes, is a procedure for a
secret ballot.  In their submission
the word `ballot' itself denotes a secret vote in a context such as this
(<i>Eyre v Milton Pty</i> <i>Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1936%5d%20Ch%20244" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1936] Ch 244</a>, 258 per Lord Wright MR),
and secrecy is required to guard the freedom of an election (<i>Kean v
Kerby</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1920/35.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1920] HCA 35</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281920%29%2027%20CLR%20449" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1920) 27 CLR 449</a>, 459 per Isaacs J).  I agree with the plaintiffs
that, although neither the Act nor Schedule 2 expressly requires that the
ballot
be a secret ballot, a requirement of secrecy is implied from the
prescriptions for multiple envelopes and a locked ballot box.  
<P>

36  	The plaintiffs submit that in the present case members who
believe that the Parmalat Proposal might affect their votes must
come forward
in order to obtain a new ballot paper.  It is likely that a member who seeks to
vote again would be in favour of the
Parmalat Proposal and therefore against
the directors' view.  Consequently, say the plaintiffs, the procedure for
change of votes
requires members to identify themselves, with no assurances as
to the protection of their privacy, as persons who do not want to
follow the
directors' line.  
<P>

37  	I agree in substance with this submission.  While the returning
officer has gone to pains to ensure the secrecy of the record
of names of
members who have received mauve ballot papers and envelopes, there is a good
chance that members who call to change their
votes will need to make
arrangements with the company secretary, who can be presumed to have close
contact with directors.  In the
circumstances the inference which would be
drawn from a request for a replacement ballot paper is that the requesting
member is at
least considering that the Parmalat Proposal warrants a change of
vote, contrary to the directors' strong recommendation.  To this
extent the
arrangements infringe the secrecy of the ballot process.  Moreover, they do so
in a way which created a real disincentive
for members to change their votes,
and therefore they are unfair and potentially oppressive upon members who
disagree with the directors,
and so the infringement is not minor or technical.
The unfairness of the arrangements is enhanced by the fact that the body
concerned
is a co-operative, whose members are linked together by business
interests and relationships, rather than merely by a common investment.
<P>

38  	At least in the present context, the requirement for a secret
ballot does not mean that the procedure must make it impossible
to link the
vote with the identity of the voter.  It is probably inevitable, and at any
rate unobjectionable, that the procedure
is such that the returning officer and
his staff have or have access to this information.  I can see no objection, per
se, to using
a different colour for replacement ballot papers and envelopes
(indeed, in the United Kingdom the Ballot Act 1872 prescribed that
a different
colour be used for replacement ballot papers, although the ballot was a secret
ballot:  see <i>Halsbury's Laws of England</i> (1910), Vol XII paragraph 616).
In <i>Woods v Sullivan</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2030%20NSWLR%20586" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 30 NSWLR 586</a>, 597, Hodgson J expressed the
view that for a returning officer in a parliamentary election to record a group
of postal votes separately
might be contrary to provisions of the electoral
legislation which were designed to preserve the secrecy of the ballot, by
limiting
the circumstances in which ballot papers could be marked for
identification.  In my opinion his Honour's observation was directed
to the
particular legislation before him, and should not be taken to imply or suggest
a universal rule that separate identification
of a group of ballot papers
destroys the secrecy of the ballot.
<P>

39  	There is, however, an overriding requirement implied by Schedule
2, that the ballot be kept secret in the sense that information
linking the
vote with the identity of the voter must be confined to those who have an
obligation to maintain secrecy.  In the present
case the problem arises not
because of the procedure as such, but because some participants in it
(including, in particular, the
company secretary) are able in the circumstances
to make inferences as to voting intentions without having any obligation to
keep
those inferences secret.
<P>

40  	The problem about secrecy could have been avoided by sending a
mauve ballot paper and envelopes to every member with the 6
September
Materials, or by ensuring that requests for new ballot papers were received
only by staff who were, and were known by the
members to be, subject to an
obligation to maintain secrecy - provided, in either case, that what was done
was authorised by an appropriate
rule.
<P>

<b>Court's power to cure procedural irregularities </b>
<P>

41  	The defendants submitted that if the Court were to find that the
change of vote procedure was unlawful, the deficiency would
be automatically
cured, or would and should be cured the Court, under s 1322 of the Corporations
Law.  In my opinion this submission
should be rejected, for several reasons.
<P>

42  	Section 8(1) of the Act states that the provisions of the
Corporations Law, other than the provisions mentioned in sub-section
(2), are
excluded from applying under their own force to co-operatives.  By sub-section
(2), the provisions which are not excluded
from applying under their own force
to a co-operative include `(n) provisions relating to powers of Court to cure
procedural irregularities
and to make other orders'.  Thus, s 8 of the Act
allows s 1322 of the Corporations Law to apply to a co-operative under its own
force
- that is, to apply to a co-operative to the extent that it literally
applies in its own terms.
<P>

43  	Section 1322(2) states that a proceeding <i>under this Law</i>
is not invalidated because of a procedural irregularity, unless the Court forms
a contrary opinion.  This case is about `proceedings'
by schemes of arrangement
and transfer of incorporation, and associated meetings, under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1992157/" class="autolink_findacts">Co-operatives
Act</a> rather than the Corporations Law.  Therefore s 1322(2) does not apply here
under its own force.  Section 1322(3) is irrelevant because
the question before
me relates to validation of a postal vote rather than a meeting.  
<P>

44  	Section 1322(4) gives the Court the power to make orders of
various kinds.  Most of those orders relate to matters under the
Corporations
Law, and to that extent s 1322(4) has no application to the present case, for
the reason already given.  It is true
that s 1322(4)(a) empowers the Court to
make an order declaring that something purporting to have been done in relation
to a corporation
is not invalid by reason of any contravention of a provision
of the constitution of the corporation, words which are wide enough
to empower
the Court to make an order with respect to a co-operative.  However, in my
opinion the invalidity in the present case
cannot be said to be `by reason of
any contravention of ... a provision of the constitution' of Dairy Farmers.
The problem arises
because of the absence of any authority under Act, the
Regulation and the Rules of Dairy Farmers to conduct the change of vote
procedure
which the directors adopted.  
<P>

45  	Even if I could persuade myself that a curative order could be
made under s 1322(4)(a) in the present circumstances, I would
not make such an
order in the exercise of my discretion.  As I have explained, the change of
vote procedure, in its operation, violated
the secrecy of the ballot process in
a manner which was unfair and potentially oppressive, and no order should be
made which would
validate it.
<P>

<b>The Court's supervisory jurisdiction over schemes of arrangement</b>
<P>

46  	It has occasionally been observed, correctly in my respectful
opinion, that the Court has a supervisory jurisdiction with respect
to schemes
of arrangement under companies legislation:  <i>Re The City Bank of Melbourne

143</a>, 146.  An example of the way in which that jurisdiction may be exercised is
found in <i>Re MB Group plc</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20BCLC%20672" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] BCLC 672</a>, esp at 681-682, which confirms
that after the members have met to approve the scheme and before making its
approval order, the court
may direct a further meeting to be held if it is not
satisfied that the will of the members has been expressed in light of full
disclosure
of all material information.  
<P>

47  	In an ingenious argument, counsel for the defendants submitted
that in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction over a scheme
which involves a
postal vote, the Court should apply by analogy some case law with respect to
parliamentary and other elections (including
union elections).  He referred to
<i>Pettit v Atkinson </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2050%20FCR%20174" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 50 FCR 174</a>, 180, for the proposition that the
object of the Court should be to give effect, as far as possible, to the will
of the electorate,
and <i>Australian Electoral Commission v Towney</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2051%20FCR%20250" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994)
51 FCR 250</a>, 255 for the proposition that the protection of the integrity of the
franchise is the Court's primary role.  In <i>Bowen v Hinchcliffe </i>(1924) 24
SR 262, 267, a case involving the election by ballot of a union official,
Street CJ in Eq applied the common law relating
to parliamentary and municipal
elections, and also made useful observations (at 266) with respect to the role
of the returning officer.
 Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that schemes of
arrangement affect private interests and property rights, and no analogy should
be drawn between the present circumstances and a parliamentary or other public
election.  But counsel for the defendants contended
that the cases, especially
<i>Bowen v Hinchcliffe,</i> go beyond the sphere of public law and should be
applied to a postal ballot in a co-operative as well.  He submitted that the
object
of the postal ballot provisions of the Act, by analogy with <i>Chanter v
Blackwood (No 2)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1904/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1904] HCA 48</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281904%29%201%20CLR%20121" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1904) 1 CLR 121</a>, 123, is to enable the members to
exercise their franchise, not to frustrate it. 
<P>

48  	For present purposes, I am prepared to assume that the cases
relied on by the defendants are relevant to the exercise of the
Court's
supervisory jurisdiction in the present circumstances.  My difficulty with the
defendants' argument is that the principles
which emerge from those cases do
not appear to me to assist the Court to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction
in a curative way
in the present case.  It cannot be doubted that in exercising
its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court must yield to the express requirements
of the relevant legislation:  <i>Re Dorman Long &amp; Co Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1934%5d%20Ch%20635" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1934] Ch 635</a>,
655.  In the present case an express requirement of Part 13 of the Act is that
in the case of a members' scheme of arrangement,
the members must agree to the
arrangement by special resolution passed by means of a special postal ballot.
The supervisory jurisdiction
does not empower the Court to disregard the
specific statutory requirements for a valid special postal ballot.  It is not a
power
to cure defects or irregularities.  Therefore, having concluded that the
change of vote procedure was invalid, the Court cannot proceed
to approve the
scheme under s 344 on the assumption that the procedure was authorised and can
be taken into account.  That does not
mean that the Court is deprived of all
relevant discretion.  As I shall point out when I come to consider the question
of relief,
there is an issue as to whether, in exercising its supervisory
jurisdiction, the Court should allow original postal votes cast prior
to the
dispatch of the 6 September Materials to stand, but that is a somewhat
different point.
<P>

49  	The cases on which the defendants rely assume that the
electorate has expressed its will on the basis of full disclosure of
all
material information.  To the extent that the members have been misinformed or
not adequately informed in the present case, it
would be inappropriate for the
Court to exercise a `supervisory jurisdiction' to disregard the informational
deficiencies.
<P>

<b>The Conduct Issue</b>
<P>

50  	The Plaintiffs complain that by distributing the 6 September
Materials to members and MCU holders, Dairy Farmers and its directors
engaged
in conduct which was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive,
contrary to some or all of four statutory regimes
dealing with misleading or
deceptive conduct.  For reasons which I shall explain, my opinion is that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a> (Cth) does not apply in the present case, but
each of the s 12DA of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act
1989
(Cth), s 995 of the Corporations Law and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a>
(NSW) is applicable.
<P>

51  	Before turning to the jurisdictional problems raised by these
various statutory regimes, I shall consider whether the defendants
engaged in
conduct which was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive for
the purposes of any of the relevant provisions.
 The meaning of `misleading or
deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive' is the same in each provision and
neither party has
submitted otherwise.
<P>

52  	I shall first consider whether Dairy Farmers and each of its
directors engaged in the conduct of distributing the 6 September
Materials, and
then note the specific complaints about the 6 September Materials and deal with
each of them in turn.  My overall
conclusion is that Dairy Farmers and each of
its directors engaged in the conduct of distributing the 6 September Materials,
and
that conduct was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive,
because the 6 September Materials were seriously misleading
in ways highly
material to the decisions by Members and MCU holders on the Restructure
Proposal.
<P>

<b>Did Dairy Farmers and its directors engage in the conduct of distributing
the 6 September materials?</b>
<P>

53  	The draft minutes of a meeting of the board of directors of
Dairy Farmers held on 3 September 1999 record that it was unanimously
resolved
`that the Chairman be authorised to work with Dairy Farmers' advisers and
management team to approve the final wording and
dispatch documentation to be
sent to Members and MCU holders as soon as possible'.  The 6 September
Materials comprising Mr Langdon's
Letter, the Response and the Media Release
were prepared and sent pursuant to that authority.
<P>

54  	It is clear that two of the Directors, Mr Langdon as Chairman
and Mr Tooth as part of the `management team' referred to in
the board
resolution, engaged in the conduct of preparing and distributing the 6
September Materials.  I accept the plaintiffs' submission
that Dairy Farmers
also engaged in that conduct, by virtue of s 12GH(2) of the ASIC Act, s 762(4)
of the Corporations Law and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s70.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 70(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a>.  The conduct was
engaged in on its behalf by directors (Mr Langdon and Mr Tooth) and by its
servants and agents (the management
team and the advisers) within the scope of
the actual authority conferred by the board's resolution of 3 September, and so
by those
provisions it was conduct taken to have been engaged in also by the
body corporate.
<P>

55  	The position of the remaining directors of Dairy Farmers is less
straightforward.  They were not separately represented at
the hearing and their
position was not the subject of comprehensive submissions.  The plaintiffs
submit that the directors should
also be taken to have engaged in the conduct
by virtue of the same statutory provisions.  Section 12GH(4) of the ASIC Act, s
762(6)
of the Corporations Law and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s70.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 70(4)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a> attribute to
a principal any conduct engaged in by his or her servants or agents within the
scope of their actual or apparent authority.
 Servants and agents of a
corporation are not the servants and agents of each individual director merely
by virtue of the fact that
the directors, acting as a corporate organ on the
corporation's behalf, have engaged them or authorised them to act.  In the
present
case, however, it was clear that the 6 September Materials, when
prepared, would communicate to members and MCU holders the opinions
of each of
the directors individually, just as the Restructure Booklet had done.  At the
board meeting of 3 September there were
resolutions that the board would
continue the existing Restructure Proposal and `reconfirm' its recommendation
to proceed with it
as the best available option to satisfy the stated
objectives, and to provide members and MCU holders with details of the
directors'
recommendation.  Those resolutions were recorded to be unanimous.
The directors must have realised that the materials that they then
authorised
the Chairman and the management team to prepare would attribute unanimous views
to the board, and in that way would purport
to express the individual views of
each director.  
<P>

56  	This was not a case where the directors acted merely as a
corporate organ, binding the corporation but not binding themselves
individually.  By passing the resolutions which were passed on 3 September,
each director individually authorised the Chairman and
management team to
communicate to the members and MCU holders on his behalf.  Therefore, when Mr
Langdon and the management team
engaged in the conduct of preparing and
distributing the 6 September Materials they did so on behalf of each director
as a principal
and as the agent of each director, within the scope of their
actual authority.  Consequently by force of the statutory provisions
to which I
have referred, each director is taken to have engaged in that conduct.
<P>

57  	It follows that if the conduct of distributing the 6 September
Materials gave rise to a contravention of the relevant statutory
provisions as
to misleading and deceptive conduct, it was a contravention by Dairy Farmers
and each of its directors.  Having reached
this conclusion I find it
unnecessary to consider the statutory provisions about accessory liability for
involvement in a contravention.
 Nor need I consider whether the conduct would
be attributed to each director on general law principles of the kind explained
by
Isaacs J in <i>Webb v Bloch</i> (1928) 41CLR 331, 365.  
<P>

<b>Particulars of misleading or deceptive conduct</b>
<P>

58  	At the hearing of the application for expedition, the plaintiffs
handed up a document headed `Plaintiffs' Particulars of Conduct
Complained Of
as to the 6 September Press Release Information'.  By that document they
contended that the 6 September Materials were
misleading or deceptive in eight
ways.  Subsequently one of those points of contention was abandoned.  In
submissions at the hearing
for determination of the separate questions, the
plaintiffs reduced the remaining contentions to five headings, and said that
the
defendants' misleading and deceptive conduct encompassed providing
information that was misleading or deceptive, and also a misleading
lack of
information.  The five headings, which I shall consider in turn, are:
<P>

&#183;	flawed valuation information;
<P>

&#183;	expert opinion unaltered;
<P>

&#183;	Palmalat Proposal can be considered later;
<P>

&#183;	lack of financial information;
<P>

&#183;	Palmalat Proposal highly conditional.
<P>

59  	Although consideration of the plaintiff's submissions
necessarily requires that I concentrate on small parts of the 6 September
Materials, the submissions must be assessed in light of the context provided by
the Materials as a whole, and the overall impression
which the Materials create
in the mind of the reader, matters discussed earlier in these reasons for
judgment.
<P>

<b>Flawed valuation information</b>
<P>

60  	Mr Langdon's Letter says:
<P>

`The Parmalat proposal is based on a valuation approach which is flawed in
favour of Parmalat, including calculations on financial
information 15 months
out of date thus failing to recognise the substantial changes in the
marketplace during that period.'
<P>

61  	The Response says:
<P>

`The Parmalat Valuation is flawed in favour of Parmalat.  Parmalat have used
year-end June 1998 results, which are 15 months out
of date.  Those results do
not include the negative impact of deregulation in Queensland, Parmalat's loss
of market share in milk
and yoghurt and the loss of the Danone business.  The
June 1998 results for ACF do not include the full year results from the Kraft
and Dairy Vale acquisitions yet Parmalat conveniently deducts the full amount
of debt associated with those acquisitions.'
<P>

62  	The Media Release says:
<P>

<b>`Flawed valuation:</b>  The Parmalat Proposal is based on a valuation
approach which is flawed in favour of Parmalat, including calculations using
financial
information which is 15 months out of date.  It fails to take account
of the impact of deregulation in Queensland, and of the substantial
market
gains made by Dairy Farmers in milk and yoghurt at the expense of Parmalat's
business'.
<P>

63  	Mr Langdon's Letter and the Media Release, by using the word
`including', imply that the flaws in the valuation approach go
beyond making
calculations on the basis of financial information which is 15 months out of
date.  However, the Response does not
suggest that there are any flaws in the
valuation approach beyond the matters which it sets out.  In my opinion a
reader of Mr Langdon's
letter would realise that its criticisms of the Parmalat
Proposal were a summary of the fuller assertions contained in the Response.
When the two documents are read together they do not suggest, to my mind, that
there are some additional flaws in the valuation approach
beyond the criticisms
made more fully in the Response.  The thrust of those criticisms is to imply
that the enterprise value placed
upon Pauls Ltd by the use of June 1998 figures
is too high because of post-balance date developments, namely the negative
impact
of deregulation in Queensland, Parmalat's loss of market share in milk
and yoghurt and the loss of the Danone business; and further
to imply that the
enterprise value of Dairy Farmers is too low, because its June 1998 results do
not include full year results for
the Kraft and Dairy Vale acquisitions, and
yet the full amount of the debt associated with those acquisitions is deducted
(since,
as appears from Attachment 3 to the Parmalat Proposal, the calculation
of the enterprise value of Dairy Farmers deducts net debt
as at 30 May 1999).

<P>

64  	The plaintiffs complain that the 6 September Materials should
have dealt with the correct valuation of Pauls and Dairy Farmers,
or expressed
the directors' opinion on it, and should have explained the methodology which
Parmalat should have used.  There may
have been some substance to the
plaintiffs contentions if, contrary to my view, the 6 September Materials had
conveyed the impression
that there were flaws in Parmalat's valuation approach
without giving any indication as to what those flaws were.  In fact the flaws
alleged by Dairy Farmers become apparent when the Response is carefully read.
The members of Dairy Farmers were not being asked to
vote on the Parmalat
Proposal, but merely to consider whether its existence should affect their vote
on the Restructure Proposal.
 It was enough for that purpose for the directors
to express their view that Parmalat's valuation approach was flawed in the
manner
indicated, with the overall implication that in the directors' view the
Parmalat Proposal undervalued Dairy Farmers shares and overvalued
Pauls.  I
therefore reject the plaintiffs' submission.
<P>

65  	Much of the argument at the hearing for determination of the
separate questions was directed towards whether in the circumstances
of this
case, the directors had an obligation to obtain for members a full valuation of
the Parmalat Proposal.  The evidence of Mr
Gibson of E&amp;Y and Mr Jephcott of
Merrill Lynch was that a full valuation would involve valuation of Pauls
Limited, since transfer
of the shares in Pauls was offered by Parmalat as
consideration for its acquisition of a controlling interest in Dairy Farmers.
In
my opinion the directors had no such duty, even though (as I shall explain)
the Parmalat Proposal was in my view material to the
decision of members on the
Restructure Proposal because implementation of the Restructure Proposal would
affect proposals such as
Parmalat's.  While the directors' duty of disclosure
under the general law is not confined to information actually known by them,
and can imply a duty to take reasonable steps to ascertain relevant information
(see <i>Fraser v NRMA Holdings Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2055%20FCR%20452" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 55 FCR 452</a>, 466), the Court will
take into account the time and cost of acquiring and preparing such
information, and the delay involved in
doing so.  Such an approach was taken,
admittedly in a somewhat different context, by Emmett J in <i>GIO Australia
Holdings Ltd v AMP Insurance Investment Holdings Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2030%20ACSR%20102" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 30 ACSR
102</a>, in that His Honour took into account such considerations in declining to
require that supplementary material in a takeover context
must include a profit
forecast.  In the present case, it is relevant that a full valuation would
require access to and examination
of extensive information relating to Pauls
(effectively, a `due diligence' investigation), a procedure which would require
the co-operation
of Pauls.  But this is not to say, as I shall point out, that
the directors were entitled to provide no, or no useful, expert opinion
as to
the impact which the Parmalat Proposal might have on the decision of members on
the Restructure Proposal - particularly as
they chose to provide the members
with a fresh opinion by the independent expert.
<P>

<b>Expert opinion unaltered</b>
<P>

66  	Of the three documents which comprise the 6 September Materials
the Response is clearly the central disclosure document.  Early
in the Response
members are told that the board continues unanimously to recommend the
Restructure Proposal.  That statement is followed
immediately by a statement
that the board has reviewed the Parmalat Proposal `with the assistance of
specialist financial and legal
advice'.  The board's key reasons for confirming
its commitment to the Restructure Proposal are then set out, and then the
following
paragraph appears:
<P>

`Ernst &amp; Young Corporate Finance Pty Ltd, the Independent Expert on the
Restructure Proposal has been provided with a copy of
the Parmalat proposal.
While it has not performed an evaluation of the Parmalat proposal, it has
reviewed its Independent Experts'
Report in light of the Parmalat proposal.
Ernst and Young Corporate Finance Pty Ltd has advised the Board that its
opinion that `the
proposed restructure is fair and reasonable and in the best
interest of existing [Dairy Farmers] Members and MCU Holders' is not
altered by
the Parmalat proposal.'
<P>

67  	In its Report dated 28 July 1999, which appears as part of
Volume 2 of the Restructure Booklet, Ernst &amp; Young Corporate
Finance Pty
Ltd (`E&amp;Y') referred to the restructuring alternatives considered by the
directors of Dairy Farmers.  They included
the following:
<P>

`3.  Strategic Investor (without listing) 
<P>

A strategic investor could include an existing milk processor (Australian or
international) or a financial investor.  Control of
the Business will in this
case, be shared by members and the strategic investor in proportion to their
investment in [Dairy Farmers].
 [Dairy Farmers] is unlikely to be able as a
co-operative to attract a strategic investor on account of the one vote - one
member
principle.  Accordingly it would be necessary for [Dairy Farmers] to
convert to a company before a strategic investor could be sought.
 
<P>

5.  Reverse Takeover
<P>

A listed Australian company acquires the business of [Dairy Farmers] from
members.  [Dairy Farmers'] shareholders would receive
shares in the acquirer in
return for their existing shareholding interests in [Dairy Farmers].  The
balance of ownership and control
would depend on the relative values of the
respective businesses.'
<P>

68  	Of the alternatives considered by the board, these two come
closest to the Parmalat Proposal.  But the `stategic investor'
alternative
seems to assume a sharing rather than a ceding of control, and does not appear
to contemplate cash payments to Dairy
Farmers members, while the `reverse
takeover' alternative contemplates a takeover by listed Australian company
which would issue
shares, giving the members of Dairy Farmers control of or a
substantial interest in the acquiring entity.  Evidently the directors
concluded, after widespread consultation with members, that only two
alternatives should be evaluated and analysed in depth, namely
the
Restructuring Proposal as it eventually emerged and an `open model' in which
Dairy Farmers would simply convert to a company
and be listed on the Stock
Exchange.  At section A33 of their Report, E&amp;Y said that the restructure
alternatives were tested
against the `key restructuring objectives of effective
control by dairy farmer members, retention of supply channel for members,
effect on gearing levels and access to external non farmer equity at a
reasonable cost', and `the issues of dairy farmer control
and milk supply were
of paramount importance in the consultative process'.
<P>

69  	The concept of `farmer control' was addressed by the evidence
and submissions.  Perhaps not surprisingly, `farmer control'
means different
things in different contexts and, apparently, to different people.  Mr
Cochrane, one of the plaintiffs, gave evidence
that in insisting on farmer
control, members wanted only to have a reasonable degree of say of what
happened to their business. 
Clearly, however, the concept of farmer control
used in the Restructure Booklet is different, and relates to the power to
determine
the outcome of a postal ballot or meeting of members.  Extreme care
would need to be taken by the directors and management, in taking
the opinion
of members on this subject, to make the latter concept clear to the members.
The Restructure Booklet does so (see, for
example, Volume I p55).  
<P>

70  	At section A65 E&amp;Y expressed their own views of restructure
alternatives.  They mentioned the strategic investor and reverse
takeover
alternatives, but they noted that those options would require the
identification of a strategic investor or a reverse takeover
opportunity,
`which have not been done as at the date of this report'.  E&amp;Y said that in
their view the directors had considered
the merits and demerits of the various
alternatives in reasonable depth, having regard to the specific requirements of
Dairy Farmers
- assuming, one infers, the paramount importance of retaining
farmer control.  E&amp;Y expressed their opinion that the alternatives
set out
by the directors were a reasonable list of realistic alternatives, even though
(as earlier mentioned) they did not quite
cover an alternative such as the
Parmalat Proposal.  They observed that `any proposal which involves control
passing from Dairy Farmers
is unlikely to be acceptable to the existing members
and existing MCU holders.'  I infer that E&amp;Y took the view that there was
no point in giving fuller consideration to the strategic investor and reverse
takeover options, or any variant of them, because an
interested party had not
been identified and the members of Dairy Farmers would not countenance loss of
farmer control. E&amp;Y's
overall conclusion was that the Restructure Proposal
was `fair and reasonable and in the best interest of existing [Dairy Farmers]
members and MCU holders.'
<P>

71  	That was the state of the members' information about E&amp;Y's
opinion when the Parmalat Proposal emerged.  Given the views
already expressed
by E&amp;Y, and given also that the issues raised by the Parmalat Proposal were
complex and well outside the probable
experience of Dairy Farmers, it is likely
that E&amp;Y's expert opinion on whether the Parmalat Proposal made any
difference to the
members' assessment of the Restructure Proposal would be a
matter of considerable importance to the members.
<P>

72  	John Gibson was one of the directors of E&amp;Y who were
responsible for preparation of the independent expert's report.  His
evidence
is that after the board meeting of 3 September 1999, he was contacted by Dairy
Farmers and its lawyers and financial advisers
(Merrill Lynch) and was asked to
express an opinion as to whether the Parmalat Proposal made any difference to
the conclusion which
had been reached in the report.  By letter to the
directors of Dairy Farmers dated 6 September 1999, he authorised the statement
which became the paragraph of the 6 September Materials which is set out above.
However, the letter which gave that authority made
a number of important points
which were not disclosed in the 6 September Materials.  First, the letter
reiterated E&amp;Y's understanding
that the issues of Diary Farmer control and
milk supply were of paramount importance in the consultative process, and that
each of
the potential restructure alternatives had been tested against a number
of objectives which included the object of effective control
by dairy farmer
members.  Secondly, the letter said:
<P>

`Ernst &amp; Young Corporate Finance:
<P>

&#183;	has not been mandated to evaluate and provide an opinion on the Parmalat
proposal; and
<P>

&#183;	is consequently not in a position to evaluate and compare the advantages
and disadvantages of the Restructure and Parmalat
proposal without assessing in
detail the Parmalat proposal.'
<P>

The letter concluded that, `based on a consideration of the above factors'
E&amp;Y continued to believe that its opinion that the
Restructure Proposal was
fair and reasonable and in the best interest of existing members and MCU
holders was not altered by the
Parmalat Proposal, and consent was given for the
inclusion in the 6 September Materials of the paragraph set out above.
<P>

73  	The plaintiffs say that the 6 September Materials were
misleading with respect to E&amp;Y's opinion in two ways:  namely, they
did not
disclose important qualifications to that opinion which were set out in
E&amp;Y's letter of 6 September 1999; and they implied
that E&amp;Y had
assisted the board by providing specialist financial advice and therefore was a
supporter of the board's views.
 I agree with both points.
<P>

74  	As to the first point, it is true that E&amp;Y's original report
had already drawn the members' attention to the significance
of preservation of
farmer control as an objective of restructuring.  However, E&amp;Y's opinion of
6 September was a different opinion
directed towards the effect of a specific
proposal which would remove farmer control.  In the new context, E&amp;Y's
expression of
`understanding' of the importance of dairy farmer control to the
members had a new significance.  If the object of preserving dairy
farmer
control is taken to be a given, then the Parmalat Proposal is necessarily
excluded from further consideration.  To the extent
that E&amp;Y's opinion of 6
September 1999 was based on assumptions that the preservation of dairy farmer
control was of paramount
importance and that the members would not consider a
proposal which would take it away, their opinion would be axiomatic and
unhelpful.
 Full disclosure of what E&amp;Y said in their letter of 6 September
1999 on the subject of dairy farmer control would have enabled
the members to
make an assessment of the extent to which this issue determined E&amp;Y's
conclusion, but no such disclosure was made.
<P>

75  	Additionally, while disclosing that E&amp;Y had not performed an
evaluation of the Parmalat Proposal but had reviewed its original
report in
light of the Parmalat Proposal, the 6 September Materials said nothing to
assist the reader to understand the difference
between the review which had
been performed and the evaluation which had not been performed.  In my opinion
the difference is by
no means self-evident.  An understanding of it would have
required at least the disclosure (as stated in E&amp;Y's letter of 6 September)
that an evaluation would involve an assessment in detail of the Parmalat
Proposal, and in the absence of such an assessment, E&amp;Y
were not in a
position to compare the advantages and disadvantages of the two proposals.
<P>

76  	Disclosure of these matters was, in my opinion, fundamental to
an assessment of the significance (or more precisely, the relative
insignificance) of E&amp;Y's statement that the Parmalat Proposal did not alter
their earlier conclusion.  The inclusion in the 6
September Materials of the
paragraph containing E&amp;Y's opinion, without disclosure of these matters,
was therefore misleading
or deceptive.  This defect in the 6 September
Materials was a serious one, given the importance which the members and MCU
holders
of Dairy Farmers would be likely to attach to the opinion of an
independent expert as to whether the Parmalat Proposal should affect
their
decision on the Restructure Proposal.  
<P>

77  	It is helpful to examine what might have been done, in order to
identify the deficiencies of what was in fact done.  I am inclined
to doubt
whether a verbatim disclosure of the qualifications contained in E&amp;Y's
letter of 6 September 1999 would have ensured
that the 6 September Materials
were not misleading.  The letter is not clearly expressed.  It does not explain
with any clarity the
relationship between E&amp;Y's opinion and its
`understanding' of the importance to dairy farmers of the preservation of
farmer control,
and does not clearly explain what E&amp;Y did to `review' its
earlier opinion in light of the Parmalat Proposal.  To prevent disclosure
of
E&amp;Y's new opinion from being misleading, it may have been necessary for
Dairy Farmers to have given a substantial explanation
of E&amp;Y's reasoning
and assumptions, going beyond the text of the letter, so that farmers could
assess the degree of significance
of the opinion.  
<P>

78  	This leads to another question:  since a proper explanation of
E&amp;Y's opinion would have provided a basis for concluding
that the opinion
was of very little value, would it have been better to exclude E&amp;Y's
opinion entirely?  
<P>

79  	It is possible that the directors of a corporation may be in
possession of relevant information, even information which is
arguably material
to the members' decision on a proposal which the directors have put forward,
and yet be entitled not to disclose
that information.  As the Full Federal
Court remarked in <i>Fraser v NRMA Holdings Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2055%20FCR%20452" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 55 FCR 452</a>, 468,
`the need to make full and fair disclosure must be tempered by the need to
present a document that is intelligible to reasonable
members of the class to
whom it is directed, and is likely to assist rather than confuse', and
therefore `in complex cases it may
be necessary to be selective in the
information provided, confining it to that which is realistically useful.'
There is room for
doubting whether E&amp;Y's opinion of 6 September 1999 was
realistically useful in this sense, and further, given the limitations
inherent
in their opinion, there may well be grounds for concluding that it would be
impossible to present the opinion to members
in a fashion which would not be
objectively misleading.
<P>

80  	Was it necessary for the directors of Dairy Farmers to provide
members with a useful opinion by the independent expert on whether
the Parmalat
Proposal affected the members' consideration of the Restructure Proposal?  The
answer to that question depends partly
upon whether the directors were right in
believing that the Parmalat Proposal could happen with or without the
Restructure Proposal,
and that the Restructure Proposal would not interfere
with the Parmalat Proposal being considered at a later date.  If that were
in
fact true, I cannot see why there would be any need to ask the independent
expert to consider whether the Parmalat Proposal altered
its opinion that the
Restructure Proposal was fair and reasonable and in the best interest of
members.  But if the directors' view
was wrong or doubtful, then the position
would be substantially different.  If one assumes, for example, that the
implementation
of even the first stage of the Restructure Proposal would cause
the Parmalat Proposal to be withdrawn, or would make it impossible
or harder
for the Parmalat Proposal to be achieved, then the making of the Parmalat
Proposal would be material to the members' consideration
of the Restructure
Proposal.  The members would need to consider whether it was in their best
interest to proceed with the Restructure
Proposal knowing of its impact on the
Parmalat Proposal, or reject the Restructure Proposal so that the Parmalat
Proposal and any
other alternatives could be brought forward.  For the reasons
given under the next heading in this judgment, my view is that the
directors'
claim, that the implementation of the Restructure Proposal did not interfere
with consideration of the Parmalat Proposal,
was wrong.  It follows, in my
view, that in the circumstances the directors were obliged to provide the
members with a supplementary
opinion from the independent expert.
<P>

81  	This conclusion is reinforced by the contents of the Restructure
Booklet.  Volume 1 p 53 ff and the Independent Expert's Report
make it clear
that in the view of the directors of Dairy Farmers and E&amp;Y, it is relevant
for members to consider alternatives
when assessing the Restructure Proposal,
and appropriate for the independent expert to consider alternatives before
forming a view
as to whether the directors' proposal is in the best interest of
members.  The alternatives which were in fact considered by E&amp;Y
and the
directors were described by E&amp;Y (volume 2 section A65) as `a reasonable
list of realistic alternatives'.  When, therefore,
another alternative comes
forward, which is indubitably realistic because it is `on the table', it must
be appropriate for the independent
expert to consider the new alternative, at
least to the same degree as the hypothetical alternatives were considered.  The
discussion
of alternatives in the Restructure Booklet and the Independent
Expert's Report therefore provides a context which, in my opinion,
implies that
when another alternative arises which was not previously being considered by
the directors and the expert, the directors'
obligation is not only to form and
report to members their own view on the new alternative, but to procure a
useful opinion of the
expert as to whether the directors' proposal remains in
the best interest of members.  
<P>

82  	In the present case, it was unnecessary for E&amp;Y to make a
valuation of Pauls.  I need not accept any specific evidence
(some of which was
contradictory) in order to conclude that such a valuation would be costly and
time-consuming, and would therefore
entail a significant delay in consideration
of the original proposal - and this at a time when the restructure must
inevitably have
caused management instability for Dairy Farmers. Moreover, the
evidence indicates that neither Dairy Farmers nor E&amp;Y had the
time or
opportunity to engage in a `due diligence' investigation of Pauls of the kind
which a reliable valuation would enquire. 
However, it would have been useful
to members, and in my view sufficient for the discharge of the directors' duty
of disclosure,
for E&amp;Y to have offered specific comments from an expert
point of view on Parmalat's valuation of Pauls, and the directors' criticisms
of it, without any necessity for them to conduct a full valuation. Further, as
a result of the investigation which it had already
conducted, E&amp;Y was in a
position to express a detailed opinion on Parmalat's valuation of Dairy
Farmers.  It is hard to see that
a full valuation of Dairy Farmers would be
needed for that purpose, assuming that E&amp;Y had properly performed its
mandate when
it had prepared the original report.
<P>

83  	The second criticism of the presentation of E&amp;Y's opinion in
the 6 September Materials is that the paragraph authorised
by E&amp;Y appears
soon after the expression of the board's opinion and the assertion that the
board was assisted by specialist financial
advice.  Consequently, it is said,
the Response implies that E&amp;Y assisted the board to form its views and
supports them.  If
that implication is present, the Response is undoubtedly
misleading, since the evidence demonstrates that although the board received
specialist financial advice, principally from Merrill Lynch, E&amp;Y did not
provide such advice and did not form an opinion to support
the board's
conclusions.
<P>

84  	The defendants say that the Restructure Booklet clearly
distinguishes between the financial adviser to Dairy Farmers, named
on page 1
of Volume 1 as Merrill Lynch International (Australia) Ltd, and the independent
expert, named on the same page as E&amp;Y.
 They say that a member of Dairy
Farmers, having read the Restructure Booklet, would understand that the
reference to `specialist
financial advice' in the Response would be a reference
to Merrill Lynch rather than E&amp;Y.
<P>

85  	In assessing this issue I must take into account that dairy
farmers were the principal class of readers to whom the 6 September
Materials
were directed.  They would be unlikely to be familiar with the roles
characteristically adopted by the advisers who congregate
around a transaction
of this kind.  In objective terms, E&amp;Y would accurately be described as a
specialist financial adviser,
therefore qualified to be the independent expert
for the Restructure Proposal.  In my view the principal audience of the
Response
would be likely to infer that E&amp;Y had assisted the board and
supported the board's strongly expressed opinions.  Therefore, the
Response was
likely to mislead, and those who distributed it engaged in conduct which was
likely to mislead.  
<P>

86  	Before leaving this point, I should note another aspect of it,
which emerged from the evidence of Mr Jephcott of Merrill Lynch
and was taken
up in the plaintiffs' closing submissions.  Mr Jephcott was very actively
involved in providing specialist financial
advice to the board during and in
preparation for its meeting of 3 September 1999, and in the subsequent drafting
of the 6 September
Materials.  He said his advice to the board was that the
Parmalat Proposal could not be assessed because of the absence of financial
information about Pauls and the lack of any opportunity to conduct due
diligence investigations.  I accept that he gave this advice
to the board.
However, for all their attacks on the Parmalat Proposal, the 6 September
Materials do not assert that the Proposal
cannot be assessed due to lack of
information.  Instead, the reader is told that the valuation approach is
defective and the Parmalat
Proposal is highly conditional.  It may be that a
critique of the Parmalat Proposal based on the proposition that there was
inadequate
information about it, would not be appealing to the authors of the 6
September Materials.  Parmalat might respond by offering access
to the
information reasonably needed for that purpose, and this would make it
difficult to maintain the negative and combative approach
which had clearly
been adopted in the drafting of the 6 September Materials.  But having been
advised by Mr Jephcott that there was
inadequate information to assess the
Parmalat Proposal, it was incumbent on the board either to convey that advice
to the members
or to reject it on proper grounds.  There is no evidence that Mr
Jephcott's advice was rejected - indeed Mr Langdon's evidence is
that he
accepted it.  Far from asserting that there was insufficient information to
assess the Parmalat Proposal, the 6 September
Materials implied that the
directors had made a negative assessment of it.  By authorising the sending out
of the 6 September Materials,
Dairy Farmers and its directors engaged in
misleading or deceptive conduct in this respect.
<P>

<b>Parmalat Proposal can be considered later</b>
<P>

87  	Mr Langdon's Letter stated that `the restructure proposal does
not interfere nor prevent proposals such as that from Parmalat
being considered
at a later date' [sic].  The Response states:
<P>

`After proper consideration, your board has unanimously confirmed its
commitment to continue with the Restructure Proposal currently
before Members
as the best available option for these reasons:
<P>

&#183;	the Parmalat proposal can happen with or without the Restructure
Proposal;
<P>

&#183;	the Restructure Proposal will strengthen [Dairy Farmers'] financial
position and negotiating strength in dealing with the
Parmalat proposal or any
other proposal; and
<P>

&#183;	the Restructure Proposal achieves the fundamental objectives of
retaining control by Farmer Members at the same time as allowing
external
equity to be raised.'
<P>

88  	These statements are somewhat surprising on their face, since
the objective of the Restructure Proposal was, in part, to improve
the
competitive position of Dairy Farmers against Parmalat and National Foods, by
enhancing its funding flexibility.  Purely as a
commercial matter, one would
expect that if the Restructure Proposal were implemented, Dairy Farmers would
be less vulnerable to
a takeover offer of the kind made by Parmalat and its
board would be in a stronger position to resist the Parmalat Proposal.  Another
commercial consideration relates to whether the Parmalat Proposal would remain
on the table if the Restructure Proposal were implemented,
given the time that
would be consumed by the later process.  There must be at least a prospect that
a participant in a highly competitive
Australian industry, which also
participates in similar industries in other countries, might withdraw its
commitment to such a proposal
and pursue an alternative strategy if it appears
that there are obstacles in the path of the proposal.  But the plaintiffs
challenged
the statements more from the structural and legal points of view
than from a commercial prospective.  
<P>

89  	The Parmalat Proposal contemplates an arrangement under Part 13
of the Act by which, with the approval of the Court, each Dairy
Farmers member
would be required to sell 25% of the member's shares in Dairy Farmers to
Parmalat for $4.02 per share.  One of the
conditions precedent to the Parmalat
Proposal is that the board of Dairy Farmers confirms its intention to proceed
and to recommend
the Proposal to the members.  If the Restructure Proposal was
not in train, the board of Dairy Farmers would have a fiduciary duty
to assess
the Parmalat Proposal and make a recommendation to the members concerning it.
In a sense, the condition precedent would
give the board a power of veto over
the Parmalat Proposal, but that would be tempered by their duty.  
<P>

90  	After the implementation of Stage 1 of the Restructure Proposal,
75% of the former shareholding interest of each active member
of Dairy Farmers
would be vested in the Supply Co-operative and the members of Dairy Farmers
would be members of the Supply Co-operative.
 The directors of Dairy Farmers
would have the authority of the members to convert it into a company within the
ensuing three years.
 Assume, first, that Dairy Farmers were to remain a
co-operative after implementation of Stage 1.  In that case, although the
Supply
Co-operative would hold 75% of the shares of Dairy Farmers, it would
have only one vote at a meeting or postal vote of members of
Dairy Farmers.  If
the Parmalat Proposal were still on the table, the board of Dairy Farmers would
still have a power of veto over
the Parmalat Proposal as before.  The single
vote attaching to the Supply Co-operative's membership of Dairy Farmers would
be controlled
by the board of directors of the Supply Co-operative.  If the
Supply Co-operative were a separate class of member for the purpose
of
considering a scheme of arrangement, it would effectively have a veto over the
arrangement, exercisable by its board.  If the
Supply Co-operative did not
constitute a separate class, it would be substantially correct to say that the
implementation of Stage
I would not of itself interfere with the respective
control positions of the Dairy Farmers board and the members voting in a
meeting
or by postal vote.
<P>

91  	If the directors of Dairy Farmers, having been authorised by the
members' approval of the Restructure Proposal, were to convert
Dairy Farmers
into a company before the Parmalat Proposal was put to the members, then any
scheme of arrangement to permit Parmalat
to compulsorily acquire 25% of the
shares of each member would be a scheme under the Corporations Law.  There
would be a potential
issue as to whether the Parmalat scheme had been proposed
to avoid the operation of Chapter 6 of the Corporations Law.  Further,
the
board of the Supply Co-operative would control 75% of the votes to be cast on
the scheme, and would therefore be in a position
of strength, so that as a
practical matter their co-operation as well as the co-operation of the board of
Dairy Farmers would be
needed for the scheme to go forward to members.  It
appears to me that the conversion of Dairy Farmers to a company would make a
difference to the Parmalat Proposal and may lead to its being reformulated -
for example, to become a takeover bid which would not
be dependent on board
co-operation, or a bid for an acquisition of the whole or part of the Supply
Co-operative's shares, for which
the approval of the other shareholders would
presumably be required.  In these circumstances, it is misleading to assert
that the
Parmalat Proposal can happen with or without the Restructure Proposal,
and that the Restructure Proposal will not interfere with
a proposal such as
that from Parmalat being considered at a later date - at any rate, without a
fuller and more precise explanation
to justify such a summary conclusion.  If
Stage II of the Restructure Proposal were to be fully implemented so that Dairy
Farmers
became a listed entity before the Parmalat Proposal was considered, the
same considerations would apply and in addition, the liquidity
of Dairy
Farmers' shares would entail that Parmalat would be dealing with market
investors as well as dairy farmers - a circumstance
which would surely be
highly material to Parmalat.  Mr Jephcott gave evidence of various ways in
which the Parmalat Proposal could
proceed after the implementation of the
Restructure Proposal.  While I accept that evidence, my view is that the 6
September Materials
were misleading because they gave no indication that such
variations to the proposal would be needed.  
<P>

92  	The implementation of the Restructure Proposal would affect the
members' consideration of the Parmalat Proposal in another
way, in my opinion.
If a scheme concerning the Parmalat Proposal were to be put to the members now,
before the implementation of
either stage of the Restructure Proposal, the
members would be in a position to dispose of more than 25% of their existing
shareholdings
in Dairy Farmers.  They could sell their entire shareholdings.
If a scheme to consider the Parmalat Proposal were brought forward
after the
introduction of Stage I of the Restructure Proposal, 75% of the members' former
shareholding interest in Dairy Farmers
would be held through the Supply
Co-operative, and the Parmalat Proposal (unless amended) would involve the
compulsory acquisition
of only 25% of the remaining 25% interest.  Members
would be free to chose individually to sell additional shares, but only up to
25% of their original shareholding interest.  Subject to the Act, the decision
to dispose of the remaining 75% of the original shareholding
interest would be
a decision for the board of the Supply Co-operative.  While that board would be
ultimately accountable to the members,
an individual member would not have any
power of disposition over the 75% shareholding interest.  It seems to me that
this change
was a highly material one for individual members, and the
statements in the 6 September Materials misleadingly implied that no such
change would occur.
<P>

93  	In their submission under this heading the plaintiffs included a
specific complaint about the Media Release.  It attributes
the following to Mr
Langdon:
<P>

`Dairy Farmers' impressive commercial success and market leadership has led to
considerable interest in the organisation from several
outside parties.  By
voting in favour of the Restructure Proposal, members will ensure that Dairy
Farmers is in the best possible
position going forward, both from a market and
shareholder position.'
<P>

The plaintiffs say that Mr Langdon was in no position to make this statement,
since he was aware that there had been no proper or
adequate evaluation of the
Parmalat Proposal by any expert.  In the circumstances, say the plaintiffs, to
say that the Restructure
Proposal would <i>ensure</i> the best possible
position is uninformed and leaves the members in a half light (citing <i>Fraser
v NRMA</i> <i>Holdings Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2055%20FCR%20452" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 55 FCR 452</a>, 487).  
<P>

94  	Mr Langdon's statement is directed to the <i>position</i> of
members after they have voted in favour of the Restructure Proposal.  It is not
a statement that the Restructure Proposal is better
than the Parmalat Proposal,
but rather it asserts that members will be in the best position to consider any
bid which may come forward,
including the Parmalat Proposal, if the Restructure
Proposal is implemented.  If it were true that the implementation of the
Restructure
Proposal would not interfere with consideration of the Parmalat
Proposal at a later date, then it seems to me Mr Langdon's statement
would be
supportable.  Since, however, I have found that proposition to be false, my
opinion is that Mr Langdon's statement is misleading
to the same extent as the
statements in various parts of the 6 September Materials to the effect that the
Restructure Proposal does
not interfere with proposals such as the Parmalat
Proposal.
<P>

<b>Lack of financial information</b>
<P>

95  	The Response contains the following statement:
<P>

`Certain key protections which will be available to farmers as part of the
Restructure Proposal, such as a limitation on [Dairy
Farmers] purchasing milk
directly from farmers and the establishment of a financially sound Supply Co
operative, will not be available
under the Parmalat proposal.'
<P>

96  	The plaintiffs say there is no basis for that statement, which
(they say) is not supported by any expert analysis.  The Parmalat
Proposal
itself says:
<P>

`The farmer members of Dairy Farmers will continue to be members of a new
Supply Co-operative and will have continued security for
milk supply through
contractual arrangements to be entered into with the merged entity.  We propose
that the principles of the milk
supply contract will be largely the same as
proposed to farmer members as set out in Section 7 of the Dairy Farmers
Restructure Proposal
subject to consultation with Dairy Farmers regarding such
changes as are appropriate to reflect the Parmalat merger proposal.'
<P>

97  	The Parmalat Proposal also says:
<P>

`It is anticipated that the Supply Co-operative will not trade and Dairy
Farmers will provide infrastructure and fund the cost of
its operations
(including directors' fees and administrative costs) of the Supply Co-operative
to a maximum of $400,000 per annum
adjusted annually for inflation.'
<P>

98  	It was proper for the 6 September Materials to raise the
question of the financial viability of the Supply Co-operative under
the
Parmalat Proposal.  In my opinion, the 6 September Materials were not
misleading in this respect, because the full text of the
Parmalat Proposal was
sent to members with the 6 September Materials.  Having been alerted to the
question of financial viability
of the Supply Co-operative by the comment in
the Response, it would be an easy matter for the reader to turn to the Parmalat
Proposal
in order to discover what financial arrangements were proposed.  While
dairy farmers would no doubt be assisted by an expert opinion
on the point,
they could make a rational assessment without such an opinion, having regard to
the information which was supplied.
 
<P>

<b>Parmalat Proposal highly conditional</b>
<P>

99  	Mr Langdon's Letter says:
<P>

`You can observe that the Parmalat proposal is little more than an invitation
to discuss an offer; it is highly conditional upon
a number of approvals.'
<P>

The first sentence of the Response labels the Parmalat Proposal as `a highly
conditional proposal'.  Later the Response sets out
the conditions precedent to
the Parmalat Proposal and then says:
<P>

`The Parmalat proposal is highly conditional on approval from regulatory
authorities, members, MCU holders and the Board approvals
of both [Dairy
Farmers] and Parmalat (Italy).  It is highly uncertain that these conditions
can be met.'
<P>

The Media Release says:
<P>

`<b>Uncertain outcome</b>:  The Parmalat proposition is highly conditional on a
number of approvals, and is likely to require over nine months to finalise
terms and implement even if these approvals were to be achieved'.
<P>

100  	The plaintiffs say that it is misleading to use such graphic
language, suggesting a level of uncertainty that is simply not
sustainable in
the light of the expert evidence.  They draw attention to the evidence of Mr
Bryant, their financial expert witness,
who said that conditions precedent of
the kind found in the Parmalat Proposal are normal and not exceptional for a
merger proposal.
 
<P>

101  	I agree, to a degree, with this submission.  It appears to me
to have been misleading for the 6 September Materials to describe
the Parmalat
Proposal as `highly' conditional, although it would have been acceptable to
draw attention to the conditions and the
consequence of non-compliance with any
of them.  It was also misleading to say that it was `highly uncertain' that the
conditions
could be met, as opposed (say) to setting out some reasons why
regulators may refuse to grant the requisite approvals.  Mr Jephcott
gave
evidence of the difficulties which Parmalat would face in obtaining regulatory
approvals.  Had the 6 September Materials explained
the difficulties which
would arise, they may have avoided the charge that they were misleading, but in
my opinion those difficulties
do not overcome the charge that it was misleading
to assert, without reasons, that attainment of the conditions was `highly
uncertain'.
<P>

<b>Conclusion on misleading or deceptive conduct</b>
<P>

102  	In my opinion, Dairy Farmers and its directors engaged in
conduct which was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or
deceive by
sending the 6 September Materials to members and MCU holders, since the 6
September Materials:
<P>

&#183;	were misleading or deceptive by including E&amp;Y's opinion without an
explanation of the qualifications to that opinion
expressed in E&amp;Y's letter
of 6 September 1999;
<P>

&#183;	were likely to mislead or deceive by implying that E&amp;Y had given
specialist financial advice to assist the board and
that E&amp;Y supported the
board's stance;
<P>

&#183;	were misleading or deceptive in failing to include Merrill Lynch's
advice that insufficient information was available to
assess the Parmalat
Proposal, and by including statements inconsistent with that advice;
<P>

&#183;	were misleading or deceptive in claiming that the Parmalat Proposal
could happen with or without the Restructure Proposal,
and that the Restructure
Proposal did not interfere with proposals such as Parmalat's being considered
at a later date;
<P>

&#183;	were misleading in describing the Parmalat Proposal as `highly
conditional' and claiming that it was `highly uncertain' that
the conditions
could be met.
<P>

<b>The Jurisdiction Issue</b>
<P>

103  	I have mentioned that there are four statutory regimes dealing
with misleading or deceptive conduct which may potentially
be relevant to the
present case.  In my judgment on the plaintiff's application for expedition
(<i>Cleary v Australian Co-operative Foods</i> [1999] NSWCS 973) I expressed
the preliminary view that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> was not applicable
here, but the other three statutory regimes were all applicable.  I directed
that the proceedings be brought to
the attention of the Australian Securities
and Investments Commission, in case it saw any need to intervene.  The
Commission intervened
by counsel at the hearing for determination of the
separate questions, confining its submissions to the issue of jurisdiction. 
<P>

104  	I shall set out my views as to the application of each of the
statutory regimes, and then I shall deal with the consequences
of my
conclusions on that matter.
<P>

the Commonwealth Government's response to the recommendations
of the Financial
Systems Inquiry, 1997 (`the Wallis Committee Report').  One of the Government's
intentions, according to the Treasurer's
Second Reading Speech (Hansard, 23
June 1998, p 5160 - 5161) was to remove regulatory overlap between the
Australian Securities and
Investments Commission (`ASIC') as it came to be
known under the legislation) and the Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission
(ACCC), which has regulatory responsibility for the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices
Act</a>.  The objective was for ASIC to become the specialist regulator for
consumer protection in the financial system.  That intention
was set out more
fully in the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill, paragraph 1.3 of
which says that the relevant amendments
will implement Recommendation 3 of the
Financial System Inquiry, which was that ASIC should have `sole responsibility
for administering
consuming protection regulation within its jurisdiction over
the financial sector'.
<P>

107  	This was achieved, inter alia, by introducing s 51AF into the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>, and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2</a> Division 2 into the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission Act 1989 (Cth).  Section 51AF creates an exception to
Part V
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>, which includes <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52.</a>  According to s
51AF(1), <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Part V</a> does not apply to the supply, or possible supply, of services
that are financial services.  Section 51AF(2) provides, without limiting
subsection (1), that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> does not apply to conduct engaged in `in relation to
financial services'.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2</a> Division 2 of the ASIC Act legislates for consumer
protection with respect to financial services by adopting provisions closely
similar
to Part V of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>, except that they are confined by
reference to financial services.  In particular s 12DA(1) is identical with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
52(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> except that the conduct proscribed must be `in
relation to financial services'.  
<P>

108  	The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> adopts the relevant definitions with
respect of financial services found in the ASIC Act.  `Financial services' is
defined in s 12BA
(1) of the ASIC Act as a service that `consists of providing
a financial product'.  `Financial product' is defined in s 12BA (1)
as
including `a security'.  Section 5(3) of the ASIC Act provides that, except is
so far as a contrary intention appears in the Act,
Parts 1.2 and 1.3 of the
Corporations Law apply as if the provisions of the ASIC Act were part of the
Corporations Law.  Section
92 of the Corporations Law defines a security as
including `shares or debentures in a body'.  `Body' is defined in s 9 of the
Corporations
Law as `including a body corporate, an unincorporated body and
includes for example a society or association'.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1992157/s29.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 29</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1992157/" class="autolink_findacts">Co-operatives Act</a> refers to a co-operative as a body corporate, and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1992157/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 33</a> of
that Act provides that a co-operative has the capacity of a natural person.
The effect of these definitions, when read with s
51AF of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices
Act</a> and s 12DA of the ASIC Act, is that conduct `in relation to' the provision
of shares in a New South Wales co-operative is governed
by s 12DA of the ASIC
Act and is not governed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>.  
<P>

109  	The words `in relation to' are well recognised as words of
expansive meaning (eg <i> Tooheys Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1961/35.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1961] HCA 35</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281960%29%20105%20CLR%20602" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1960)
105 CLR 602).</a>  The fact that conduct is in relation to other maters does not
prevent it from being in relation to financial services as well. 
Once it is so
classified, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> is inapplicable and the matter falls within
legislation for which ASIC has sole responsibility, namely the ASIC Act and the
Corporations
Law.
<P>

110  	Was the conduct which comprised sending the 6 September
Materials to members and MCU holders conduct in relation to the provision
of
shares?  The provision of shares in two bodies was part of the subject matter
of the 6 September Materials.  Enclosed with the
6 September Materials was the
Parmalat Proposal, which dealt with the transfer of all of the shares in Pauls
Ltd to Dairy Farmers,
and the acquisition by Parmalat of the shares of members
of Dairy Farmers.  Additionally the 6 September Materials were sent to members
to provide information relevant to the Restructure Proposal, which dealt with
the provision of shares of Dairy Farmers to the new
Supply Co-operative and the
ultimate listing of Dairy Farmers on Stock Exchange, so as to permit members to
sell their shares in
the market.  It may also be correct to view the MCUs as
debentures and if so, the 6 September Materials related to the provision
of
debentures as well as shares, but it is unnecessary for me to rely on that
point.  In my opinion both the Parmalat Proposal and
the Restructure Proposal
were so obviously related to dealings in shares, and hence the provision of
shares to the party acquiring
them, that the conduct of sending the 6 September
Materials to members to inform them of the Parmalat Proposal and to comment in
light of the Restructure Proposal was clearly conduct `in relation to financial
services'.  Hence <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> had no application to it and
s 12DA of the ASIC Act was potentially applicable.  
<P>

111  	Counsel for ASIC drew my attention to ss 109J and 109L of the
Corporations Law, which are applicable to the construction of
s 12DA of the
ASIC Act by virtue of s 5(3) of the latter Act.  Those provisions allow the use
of extrinsic material (including explanatory
memoranda and second reading
speeches) as an aid to interpretation in circumstances of ambiguity and require
the Court to prefer
a construction that promotes the purpose or object of the
relevant provision.  I regard the question of construction in the present
case
as so plain that it is unnecessary to call these provisions in aid.  However
the Second Reading Speech and Supplementary Explanatory
Memorandum provide
strong support for the view which the literal construction dictates. They
indicate that the intention of the amendments
which took effect on 1 July 1998
was to make ASIC the sole regulator of consumer protection with respect to
financial services. 
Misleading conduct in a circular with respect to a
restructuring proposal and a competing offer, such as in the present case, is
manifestly a matter for surveillance by the regulator which is exclusively
responsible for consumer protection in the financial services
industry. 
<P>

112  	Section 995 of the Corporations Law deals with misleading or
deceptive conduct in connection with any dealings in securities.
 It is not
confined to dealing in the securities of any particular kind of body, and
therefore it is capable of applying to dealings
in the securities of a New
South Wales co-operative.  The word `deal' is defined in s 9 in the manner in
which encompasses acquiring
or disposing of securities under a scheme of
arrangement, including an arrangement under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1992157/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1992157/" class="autolink_findacts">Co-operatives Act</a>.
Since the sending of the 6 September Materials its conduct in connection with
dealing in Dairy Farmers shares under the Restructure
Proposal, and conduct in
connection with dealing with those shares under an alternative arrangement
proposed to implement the Parmalat
Proposal, as well as conduct in connection
with the shares in Pauls Ltd, s 995 is potentially applicable.
<P>

113  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a> (NSW) has not been
amended so as to exclude conduct in relation to financial services.  If,
therefore, the conduct of sending out
the 6 September Materials was engaged in
trade or commerce, then <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> is also applicable.  This result seems to be
confirmed, as far as <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2</a> Division 2 of the ASIC Act is concerned, by s 12AE
of the latter Act.  The application of s 42 to conduct in relation to financial
services is out of line with the Commonwealth Government's intention to give
ASIC sole responsibility for consumer protection in
the financial services
industry, and it may be that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a> will be amended in due
course.
<P>

114  	I have concluded that s 995 of the Corporations Law applies
because the relevant conduct was in connection with dealing in
securities.
That section does not require that the conduct be in trade or commerce, but
both s 12DA of the ASIC Act and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a> contain that
requirement.  In <i>Fraser v NRMA Holding Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2055%20FCR%20452" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 55 FCR 452</a>, 464 the
Full Federal Court held that the conduct of sending a `prospectus' for
demutualisation of the two NRMA companies to their
members was in trade or
commerce, but the point is not elaborated.  In <i>NRMA Ltd v Yates</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/859.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999]
NSWSC 859</a> Santow J held, for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a>, that the conduct of a
director of NRMA in publishing a misleading advertisement which alleged that
the NRMA board was guilty of
`great waste and mismanagement' was engaged in for
the purpose of promoting a campaign for the election of like-minded directors
to the board of NRMA in order to avoid further waste and mismanagement, and in
that way to influence the future trade and commerce
of NRMA by changing its
corporate governance.  In <i>Yates v Whitlam</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/976.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 976</a> Windeyer J
held that the conduct of the defendants in publishing advertisements seeking
support for their re-election to the board
was not conduct in trade or
commerce, on the ground that it was part of the conduct involved in standing
for election and such conduct
is not intrinsically a business or professional
activity.  Assuming both of those cases to be correctly decided, the point of
distinction
appears to be that in the first case the advertisement was by a
director seeking to influence the future commercial conduct of the
board, while
in the latter the advertisement was purely an election advertisement.  In the
present case I regard it as beyond doubt
that the conduct of sending to members
a proposal for a merger of their corporation with another, and commenting on it
by reference
to a restructure proposal which would lead to the listing and
trading of shares in the corporation, is conduct in trade or commerce.
 It
follows that ss 12DA and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">42</a>, as well as s 995, are applicable in the present
case.
<P>

115  	The remedies for contravention of s 12DA of the ASIC Act and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a> are very similar to the remedies for contravention
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>.  As the Full Federal Court noted in
<i>Fraser v  NRMA Holding Ltd</i> 55 FCR at 464, the scope of the remedies
available under the Corporations Law in the event of a contravention s 995 may
be greater
than in the case of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52.</a>  The difference may be significant in a
case where the Court is asked to make an order requiring disclosure of
information or the
publication of advertisements.  Section 12GE of the ASIC
Act, which appears to be based on s 80A of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a>, empowers
the Court to make such an order on the application of the Minister or ASIC.  In
the case of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 67</a> refers to an application by the Minister
or the Director-General of the Department of Fair Trading.  It may be that an
order of that
specific kind cannot be made on the application of a private
litigant.  That would not necessarily prevent the Court from granting
an
injunction to restrain continuance or repetition of misleading conduct, with
liberty to apply, which could be exercised if the
risk of continuation of
misleading conduct was removed by corrective disclosure:  see <i>Fraser v NRMA
Holdings Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2014%20ASCR%20656" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 14 ASCR 656</a>, 685 per Gummow J.  The remedial provisions
of the Corporations Law are in a rather different form, but one obvious source
of jurisdiction
to make an order requiring corrective advertising, s 1114, is
available relevantly only on the application of ASIC.  Moreover, if
an
application is made by ASIC for an order for publication under s 12GE, the
jurisdiction to deal with it is confined to the Federal
Court under s 12GJ,
while there is no equivalent restriction on this Court's jurisdiction to make
an order under s 1114.  
<P>

<b>The Relief Issue </b>
<P>

116  	Counsel for the defendants submitted that if the Court
concludes, as I have, that the 6 September Materials were misleading
or
deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive, I should allow further submissions
to be made as to the most appropriate form of relief.
 I agree that this is the
proper course.  However, it is appropriate that I should make some observations
on the general question
of relief.
<P>

117  	I have concluded that the change of vote procedure was not
authorised by the Act, the Regulation and the Rules of Dairy Farmers,
and
additionally, that the procedure which was used was incompatible with the
implied requirement that the ballot process be a secret
ballot process.  It
seems to follow that the replacement votes cast pursuant to the defective
procedure must be disregarded.  
<P>

118  	A more difficult question is whether the original votes which
have already been cast must also be disregarded.  Subject to
being persuaded
otherwise by submissions of the parties, it seems to me that there are
essentially two alternatives.  One is to take
the view that in the events which
have happened, the original votes cannot be relied upon as a true expression of
the will of the
members, because they were either cast without knowledge of the
material information relating to the Parmalat Proposal, and therefore
were
uninformed votes, or they were cast after misleading information about the
Parmalat Proposal was supplied in the 6 September
Materials.  The other
alternative (assuming an appropriate rule change can be made) is to take the
view that votes which have been
cast should be regarded as valid, provided that
all members are given the opportunity to replace their votes in a procedure
which
complies with all relevant legal requirements including the requirement
for a secret ballot.  
<P>

119  	The second alternative raises an important issue of fairness,
along the lines of the issue discussed by Santow J in <i>Re Advance Bank
Australia Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2022%20ACSR%20513" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 22 ACSR 513</a>, 533 ff.  In His Honour's words (at 535),
the question is whether management should be allowed to `conscript the benefits
of shareholder
apathy', as they would if votes, which have already been cast by
members who do not bother to replace them after full disclosure
is made, are
treated as valid and effective.  Another question, not wholly separate from the
`inertia' question, is whether I should
take the view that the defects in the 6
September Materials are so serious and fundamental that, in effect, the well
has been poisoned
and that supplementary, corrective disclosure cannot reverse
the misleading impression created by the 6 September Materials.  If
I were to
take that view, it may follow that the entire disclosure process should be
re-commenced.
<P>

120  	My present inclination is to hold that the statutory procedure
for approval of a scheme of arrangement under Part 13 of the
Act involves
giving the proponents of the scheme the benefit of the inertia factor.  This is
because Part 13 envisages that the postal
voting procedure will be conducted
over a period of time.  Given that, as I have held, the directors' duty to
disclose material new
information continues during that time, the view that the
proponents of the scheme should not have the benefit of the inertia of
members
who have already voted would mean that if a disclosable material change occurs
during the postal voting process, the postal
vote must start again, whatever be
the cost and disruption that may follow.  That seems to me to be a conclusion
not required by
the law, and one which should be avoided if possible.
Consequently, in a case where a postal ballot is involved, one may have to
accept that the proponents of the scheme should have the benefit of the inertia
of members who have already voted before supplementary
disclosure is made and
do not subsequently bother to vote again.  
<P>

121  	As to whether the defective 6 September Materials have poisoned
the well to such a degree that one must start the entire disclosure
process
again, my present inclination is to say that though the deficiencies in the
Materials are serious, the most serious problem
relates to E&amp;Y's opinion,
and it could probably be overcome if an informative and reasoned opinion could
be produced, and supplied
to members, with a statement which expressly
negatives the other misleading aspects of the 6 September Materials.  But I
assume the
parties will have submissions to make on that point.
<P>

122  	This leads me to the view, a very provisional one at the
moment, that it may be possible for the existing scheme procedure
to be saved
by supplementary disclosure and the adoption of a procedure which validly
permits all members to cast replacement votes
in a secret ballot process.  Such
an outcome assumes that it will be possible for Dairy Farmers to adopt an
authorising rule to permit
the change of vote procedure.  As I have mentioned,
s 112 of the Act permits the rules of a co-operative to be altered by
resolution
passed by the board if, inter alia, the Registrar is satisfied that
the approval of the alteration by the members of the co-operative
is not
necessary and alteration by the board would be appropriate.  Without wishing to
pre-empt or interfere with the Registrar's
discretion, it may be helpful for me
to say that if an application were made for the Registrar's approval for the
adoption of a change
of vote rule which reflects the principles in this
judgment, the Registrar could have regard to all of the special circumstances
which I have set out and having done so, may find it not unreasonable to
approve such a rule without requiring a special resolution
of the members.
<P>

123  	Once these matters have been addressed, a question may arise as
to the power of the Court to make an order requiring corrective
disclosure or
advertising, on the application of a private litigant.  The Court will be
assisted by the submissions of the parties
on this question, in light of the
observations made above.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

124  	I answer the separate questions as follows:
<P>

1.1	The procedure with respect to change of votes was not a lawful
procedure.
<P>

1.2	The information supplied to members and MCU holders in the 6 September
Materials was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead
or deceive, and
consequently by sending the 6 September Materials to members and MCU holders
the first and second defendants engaged
in conduct in contravention of s 12DA
of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989 (Cth), s 995
of the Corporations
Law and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 42</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a> (NSW).
<P>

1.3, 1.4 and 1.5  The proceedings will be adjourned to enable the parties to
make submissions with respect to relief having regard
to these reasons for
judgment.
