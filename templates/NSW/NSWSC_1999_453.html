<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>

1   	What follows are my reasons for orders made on 21 April
1999; a copy of those orders is appended. They follow a report dated
12 March
1999 by a Referee valuing certain units in a unit trust. Such value depends in
turn on the valuation of certain property
employed in a precast concrete
business owned by two companies in receivership, namely, real estate comprising
"the Plumpton Property",
the work in progress, the plant and equipment, and the
goodwill of the business. My orders require that the Referee further consider
his report; that is, taking into account such evidence and submissions as may
subsequently be made by the parties in relation to
receivership files that the
referee had earlier reviewed prior to handing over his report without at the
time apprising the parties
of that fact and giving them the opportunity then to
make submissions.
<P>

2   	The Referee had said in his report that: 
<P>

	"At the time of the Court's referral to me (on 30 October 1997) pursuant to
Part 72 of the Supreme Court rules, I was a partner
of Price Waterhouse. On 1
July 1998, Price Waterhouse and Coopers &amp; Lybrand merged to become
PricewaterhouseCoopers. As noted
in paragraph 3.3 above, the Receivers and
Managers of Mercap and ICM were from Coopers &amp; Lybrand. As such, I have
availed myself
of the opportunity to review relevant files of the receivership
for the purposes of satisfying myself that the conclusions I have
reached in
relation to the value of the Plumpton Property, the work in progress, the plant
and equipment, and the goodwill of the
business were not inconsistent with
either the available documentation at the time of receivership or my knowledge
of the precast
concrete industry which commenced in late 1974 when I was
involved with the then receivership of Rescrete Industries Pty Limited.
That
company has for some time now been a highly regarded participant in the
industry. My firm has continued to be involved with
the Rescrete group of
companies since then, as indeed have I other than for a period of some 4 years
(1981-1985) when I was with
Price Waterhouse in Fiji."
<P>

3   	The orders I made followed the Plaintiffs successfully
contending before me that they had been denied natural justice by reason
of
procedural unfairness in the Referee reviewing this material in the manner
described. It remains to be seen whether any further
evidence and submissions
does, or does not, result in any altered conclusion by the Referee. The effect
of my orders is that he will
need to direct his mind to that matter. In saying
that, I do not wish it suggested that, apart from the effect, if any, of such
further
evidence and submissions, it was not open to the Referee to reach the
conclusion he did.
<P>

4   	After I gave my decision but before delivering these
reasons, the Plaintiffs, after initially stating that they were considering
whether or not to make application for the referee to be disqualified on the
ground of apparent bias, indicated that they would not
be doing so. This was
however based on the material so far inspected from the receivership files;
clearly if further material comes
to light, the Plaintiffs reserve their
position. If such an application were to be contemplated, it should be made
promptly. The
orders I have earlier made proceed on the basis that no such
application is anticipated. They also require that the Referee identify
precisely the relevant materials which he had thus reviewed.
<P>

5   	The Referee's report comes about in the adversarial context
of a dispute between the two groups of unit holders in the two
trusts
purchasing the relevant business assets (one purchasing the real estate, the
other the balance of the assets). The principal
proceedings between them were
resolved on the basis that one group of unit holders would buy out the other
group (representing 35%
of the units) at a valuation to be determined by the
Referee as at 1 August 1995. That valuation is now the remaining focus of
dispute.
The significance of that date is that the sale contract for the
property and equipment pre-dated August 1995 and completion took
place in
October 1995. Under "Salient Facts" I elaborate on the report in the context of
the events it reported upon.
<P>

<b>SALIENT FACTS</b>
<P>

6   	On 30 October 1997, by consent, the court ordered that the
valuation of units in each of two trusts, namely the ICM Unit Trust
and the
Plumpton Unit Trust ("the Trusts") be referred to Mr Frank Fischl, then a
partner of the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse
&amp; Co, for an enquiry and
report, pursuant to Pt 72 of the Supreme Court Rules. Subsequently, as becomes
relevant, Price Waterhouse
&amp; Co merged with Coopers &amp; Lybrand so that
Mr Fischl became a partner of the merged firm. This as he reveals in his
report,
gave him access to the latter's receivership files. The words "as such"
make clear that the merger gave him access to files to which
he would otherwise
not have had access, or at any rate such ready access. Without such access, he
might well have had to follow a
more formal process to gain access to this
material. That in turn might have prompted the Referee to advise the parties of
that step
at the time; they could have then made any submissions before the
Referee finalised his report.
<P>

7   	On 30  October 1997, by consent, the court further ordered
that:
<P>

&#183;	the valuation be as at 1  August 1995 ("the valuation date");
<P>

&#183;	in valuing the said units the referee shall not increase or decrease the
value attributed to the units by reason of the units
constituting a minority
unitholding in the Trusts; and
<P>

&#183;	for the purpose of valuation, the Trusts shall be deemed to include all
of the assets that were purchased from the Receiver
and Manager of Mercap Pty
Limited. (Receiver and Manager Appointed) ACN 003 556 376 ("Mercap") and
Industrial Concrete Manufacturing
Pty Limited (Receiver and Manager Appointed)
ACN 003 563 626 ("ICM") by the Trusts and making due allowance for such
liabilities
as were incurred by the Trusts to acquire those assets.
<P>

8   	In a letter to Mr Fischl from the Defendants' solicitors,
Smits Leslie, dated 29 October 1997 which was also signed for and
on behalf of
the Plaintiffs by their solicitors, Ross Koffel Solicitor, Mr Fischl was to
"value the relevant Units on the basis that
they represent 35% of all of the
Units on issue in both of the Trusts". And, it was said,
<P>

"there is no necessity to break down the attributed value as between any of the
Plaintiffs or their associates, i.e. their unitholdings
are to be valued in one
line and there is no need to take account of any changes in the unitholdings,
i.e. it can be assumed simply
that [Mr Fischl] is required to value 100% of the
net trust assets (trust assets minus trust liabilities) and to apply 35% of
that
value to establish the value of the relevant Units".
<P>

9   	The referee reported on 12 March 1999 and concluded
(paragraph 2) that the fair market value of the Plaintiffs' thirty-five
per
cent interest in each of the Trusts as at 1 August 1995 was nil. Reasons for
that conclusion are set out in sections 5 to 9 of
the report.
<P>

10   	To understand the task before the referee, it is necessary
to appreciate that, in the manner described below, the two Trusts
acquired
their principal assets by purchasing the business and assets conducted by the
two companies then in receivership, Mercap
Pty Limited and ICM 2000 Pty
Limited. This was a business of manufacture and sale of pre-cast concrete
panels with associated real
estate (the Plumpton Property). Set out below and
taken from the report, are the salient facts concerning that acquisition of
assets
and undertaking.
<P>

"3.1	Prior to 3 July 1995 ICM and Mercap had conducted the business of the
manufacture and sale of precast concrete panels from
the property at Plumpton
referred to in paragraph 3.5 below ("the business").
<P>

3.2	At all material times the Commonwealth Bank of Australia ("CBA") held an
Equitable Mortgage Debenture over the assets and undertaking,
whatsoever and
wheresoever, existing and future, of Mercap and ICM.
<P>

3.3	On 18 April 1995 the CBA appointed Messrs Anthony Gardiner Sherlock and
Martin Russell Brown of Coopers &amp; Lybrand to act
as Receivers and Managers
(collectively "the Receivers and Managers" or individually "the Receiver and
Manager") of the respective
assets and undertakings of Mercap and ICM.
<P>

3.4	On 22 May 1995 Mr Andrew J Love of Ferrier Hodgson was appointed liquidator
of Mercap and ICM by the Supreme Court of New South
Wales.
<P>

3.5	On 3 July 1995 the former ICM 2000 Pty Limited company ("the Original
Trustee") purchased from Mercap, on certain terms and
conditions, the real
estate comprised in Folio Identifier 2/23723 which otherwise has the
residential address of 202 Power Street,
Plumpton in the State of New South
Wales ("the Plumpton Property") for a consideration of $475,000. The relevant
contract for sale
was completed on 16 October 1995.
<P>

3.6	Simultaneously (on 3 July 1995), the Original Trustee purchased certain
plant and equipment from Mercap for a consideration
of $450,000. That purchase
was also completed on 16 October 1995.
<P>

3.7	The said purchases were funded totally by borrowings by the Original
Trustee as follows:
<P>

(i)	$570,000 was advanced to the Original Trustee by Expolab Pty Limited;
and
<P>

(ii)	the balance required for settlement of $268,379.56 ($838,379.56 minus that
$570,000) was provided by Westpac Banking Corporation.
<P>

3.8	On or around 1 May 1995, the Original Trustee purchased from ICM the
benefit of work in progress at the date of purchase, for
a consideration of
$250,000."
<P>

11   	In relation to paragraph 3.3 above and 3.6 above certain
additional material appears in s3 of the report but it is not necessary
specifically to note that for present purposes.
<P>

12   	The assets in question comprised real property, plant and
equipment, work in progress and, if it existed at all, goodwill.
The Plaintiffs
and Defendants differed as to the valuation to be attributed and each submitted
to the Referee their own expert's
valuation, referred to as the Vella Report
for the Plaintiffs and the McGrane Report for the Defendants. The Referee chose
valuations
at the lower end of the spectrum and thus favoured the Defendants'
contentions. I now set out those facts which bear upon the potential
significance of the receivership files in determining that value. That
potential significance derived from the fact that the receivers
only elicited
one offer, namely that from Mr Wong, who was associated with the eventual
purchaser, as I explain.
<P>

13   	Paragraph 5.1 of the report provided as follows:
<P>

"5.1	My opinion in paragraph 4.10.5 above was that there would not have been
sufficient future maintainable earnings, if any, as
at 1 August 1995 such that
the capitalisation of those earnings would exceed the net underlying assets of
the business. It must therefore
follow that there would not have been any value
in the goodwill of the business at the time. This is consistent with the fact
that
the Receiver and Manager, who had advertised the business for sale, was
unable, not surprisingly in my opinion, to achieve a value
for the goodwill.
Indeed, shortly after his appointment, he ceased business and all manual and
sub-contract labour was terminated."
<P>

14   	It is then said that a number of interested parties
including a Mr Wong, were circulated by the receivers with a "business
for
sale" information memorandum dated April 1995. Notwithstanding that further
inquiries received from some of the parties so circulated,
"no offers were
forthcoming other than from Mr Wong"; see paragraph 5.4.
<P>

15   	Thus it was said (at paragraph 7.6) that, "there can be no
better indication of value of the plant and equipment than that
($450,000)
which was realised by the Receiver and Manager after having advertised the
business for sale and not having received any
offer other than from Mr Wong."
This lead to the value being placed on plant and equipment as at 1 August 1995
of $450,000 (see paragraph
7.7 of the report).
<P>

16   	I should explain that Mr Wong is a principal of ICM 2000
Pty Limited and thus was associated with the companies whose businesses
were
disposed of and also was associated with the trusts which were the purchasers.
That, with the absence of any competing bids
elicited by the receivers'
efforts, clearly bears upon the valuation of the 35% interest in the trusts'
units. The Plaintiffs were
not effectively contradicted in their contention
that the Referee, in reviewing the receivership files, thus had regard to the
record
of events potentially significant as to the valuation in which the
receivers were directly involved; this included in particular
their
advertisement of the sale, preparations for sale generally and the sale itself.
That they received no offers other than from
Mr Wong is potentially affected by
how vigorously the receivers pursued these steps. In saying that, I have no
evidence before me
to suggest that they did not do all that they reasonably
could. But that could be verified, one way or the other, inter alia by
reviewing
the receivers' files; the Plaintiffs complain that they were denied
the opportunity to participate at all in that process.
<P>

17   	Thus it appears that the principals of the two Trusts were
the same as for the original companies with Mr Wong being thus
associated on
both sides of the transaction. I should also note that both the Plaintiffs and
the Defendants have by way of submission,
put forward competing valuations to
the Referee, being the valuation referred to as "the Vella Report" and "the
McGrane Report. Those
reports as well as a draft statement of facts and issues
were thus before the Referee. Other materials before the referee are outlined
in the Report.
<P>

<b>THE LEGAL QUESTION -- </b>Breach of the rules of natural justice: procedural
fairness<b>?</b>
<P>

18   	I now turn to the critical issue in the present
proceedings. Appendix A to the Referee's report sets out under the heading
"Sources of Information" the items earlier referred to and various other
documents and concludes with the paragraph I have set out
in 2 above.
<P>

19   	I earlier quoted that paragraph in full in order to give
its context. The particular portion complained of by the Plaintiffs
is the
portion commencing with the words "as such" and concluding with the words
"pre-cast concrete industry". Essentially the Plaintiffs'
case is that before
the Referee handed down his report, and without informing the Plaintiffs (or
the Defendants), he inspected and
relied upon documents relevant to the
valuation of the assets of the Trust over and above those of which the parties
were aware.
It is then said that this procedure denied to the Plaintiffs any
opportunity to inspect the documents, adduce evidence, or make submissions
as
to their effect; for example that they were "inconsistent with" the Referee's
conclusions otherwise drawn. That procedure is said
to constitute a clear
breach of procedural fairness and denial of natural justice; <i>Kioa v West
</i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/81.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 81</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20159%20CLR%20550" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 159 CLR 550</a> at 582, <i>Re JRL; ex parte CJL </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20161%20CLR%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 161 CLR 342</a>
at 350.
<P>

20   	The Plaintiffs' cite, and I adopt, the following passage
from the judgment of Rogers CJ Comm D in <i>Telecomputing PCS Pty Ltd and
others v Bridge Wholesale Acceptance Corporation (Aust) Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2024%20NSWLR%20513" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 24 NSWLR
513</a> at 523 as reflecting well-settled principle, as applicable in this
context:
<P>

"It is established, by judgments by each of the judges of the Commercial
Division, that referees are required to afford to parties,
natural justice.
What natural justice may require in a given case, may vary substantially. There
is no better guide, however, than
the test of fairness. Fairness demands that
each party be afforded a proper opportunity of putting before the referee
particulars
of the contentions relied upon and an opportunity to comment, not
just on the information adduced by the other side, but also any
information on
contentious matters which may have been gathered by the referee. Further it
means that a referee should not form a
concluded opinion, or close his or her
mind to the contentions of the parties before all the evidence is in."
<P>

21   	In reaching that conclusion, Rogers CJ Comm D was dealing
with a referee required to perform his functions under Pt 72 r8,
para (b) of
which providing: 
<P>

"the referee, in conducting proceedings under the reference, is not bound by
rules of evidence but may inform himself or herself
in relation to any matter
in such manner as the referee thinks fit."
<P>

22   	That rule is to be read with the provisions of the "Usual
Order for Reference" contained in Practice Note 100, in particular
para 4(c).
This provides that the 
<P>

"referee consider and implement such manner of conducting proceedings under the
reference as well, without undue formality or delay,
enable a just
determination to be made including, if the referee thinks fit:
<P>

(i)	the making of inquiries by telephone;
<P>

(ii)	site inspection;
<P>

(iii)	inspection of plant and equipment; and
<P>

(iv)	communication with experts retained on behalf of the party."
<P>

23   	However the Plaintiffs contend, in my judgment correctly,
that reliance cannot be placed upon Pt 72, r8 as giving a licence
not just to
refer to additional material in the Referee's discretion, but also, when doing
so, to fail to inform the parties so that

<P>

"each party be afforded a proper opportunity of putting before the referee
particulars of the contentions relied upon and an opportunity
to comment, not
just on the information adduced by the other side, but also any information on
contentious matters which may have
been gathered by the referee."
<P>

(See Plaintiffs' written submissions.)
<P>

24   	Clearly enough if the information gathered by the Referee
is not contentious, or is peripheral, I do not consider that such
category of
information need be submitted to each party for submissions. That laborious
process would undermine the expeditious resolution
of disputes to which the
referee procedure is directed. But that was not the case here for reasons I
elaborate.
<P>

25   	I turn to what was said by Gleeson CJ in <i>Super Pty Ltd
v SJE Formwork (Aust) Pty Limited </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2029%20NSWLR%20549" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 29 NSWLR 549</a> at 563:
<P>

"Subject to what has just been said, it is undesirable to attempt closely to
confine the manner in which the discretion is to be
exercised: cf Nicholls v
Stamer <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1980/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] VicRp 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20VR%20479" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) VR 479</a> at 495 per Brooking J. The nature of the complaints made
about the report the type of litigation involved, and the length and complexity
of the proceedings before the referee, may all be relevant considerations. The
purpose of Pt 72 is to provide, where the interests
of justice so dictate, a
form of partial resolution of disputes alternative to orthodox litigation, and
it would frustrate that purpose
to allow the reference to be treated as some
kind of warm-up for the real contest. On the other hand, if the referee's
report reveals
some error of principle, some absence or excess of jurisdiction,
or some patent misapprehension of the evidence, that would ordinarily
be a
reason for rejecting it: cf Jordon v McKenzie  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2026%20CPC%20%282d%29%20193" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 26 CPC (2d) 193.</a> So also
would perversity or manifest unreasonableness in fact-finding. As to the last
mentioned matters, I refer again to the history
of the rules and to Buckley (v
Bennell Designs &amp; Constructions Pty Ltd <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1978/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] HCA 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20140%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 140 CLR 1.)"</a>
<P>

26   	Denial of natural justice is cognate with "perversity or
manifest unreasonableness in fact-finding". The critical issue here
is the
nature of the information that the Referee considered and how it bore, or
potentially may have borne, upon the Referee's report.
I have earlier dealt
with that, but elaborate below on certain aspects. 
<P>

27   	The Defendants first attempted to deny there was any room
for the application of the requirement of fairness where the relevant
Supreme
Court Rules permitted the referee to inform himself or herself in relation to
any matter in such manner as the referee thinks
fit. However, they did not
press that contention in light of the decision in <i>Telecomputing PCS Pty Ltd
and others v Bridge Wholesale Acceptance Corporation (Aust) Ltd </i>(supra),
where quite clearly those Rules did not prevent such a principle of fairness
being applied in the manner I have described.
<P>

28   	Clearly enough, what transpired is that by reason of the
adventitious circumstance that Price Waterhouse and Coopers &amp;
Lybrand had
merged on 1 July 1998, the Referee became a partner of the merged firm. He was
thus able to avail himself of the opportunity
to review relevant files of the
receivership conducted by Mr Sherlock and Mr Brown of Coopers &amp; Lybrand. I
am not of course suggesting
that there was anything improper in so doing. One
may trust the independence of the Referee in the present circumstances,
notwithstanding
that the merger latterly brought him into partnership with the
receivers. Nonetheless information in the present case which the Receiver's
files would have revealed would necessarily include what is highly relevant,
namely the efforts made by the Receiver to find purchasers
and the responses to
those efforts. Though the Referee has stated elsewhere in his report that the
only offer received was from Mr
Wong that of itself should not deprive the
Plaintiffs of the opportunity of testing to the extent reasonable the
information which
would have been thus made available from the Receiver's files
in the way I have indicated. It may be that at the end of that process
nothing
would have emerged which would lead to any different conclusion than the
Referee reached, but equally that cannot be assumed.
<P>

29   	What needs to be emphasised is that significance and its
consequences is not diminished by the fact that the Referee reviewed
these
files only after having reached his conclusions. The very fact he saw fit to
refer to the files means they had a potential
significance, though in the end
he said they simply confirmed conclusions already reached. That can be tested
by assuming that instead
of being confirmatory they negated a conclusion
earlier reached. 
<P>

30   	The Defendants however contended that the Referee's
actions in consulting the Receivers' files could have had no effect upon
the
final outcome as he had already reached his conclusions and that this negated
any conceivable unfairness. But the Plaintiffs
correctly point to the fallacy
in that conclusion in these terms (see the Plaintiffs' written submissions of
20 April 1999):
<P>

"11.1	The Referee's own words dictate that material in the files corroborated
for him the views he held. Necessarily, that must
mean that the documents
affected the process by which he reached his ultimate decision.
<P>

11.2	The relevance of the material is demonstrated by the Referee's references
in his Report [e.g. paras 5.1, 6.4, 7.6] to steps
taken by the Receivers in
selling the assets to be 
<P>

valued.
<P>

11.3	The very fact that the Referee consulted the material "for the purposes of
satisfying" himself as to his conclusions illustrates
that his decision-making
process was not then at an end, and that he did not regard it as at an end.
<P>

11.4	Alternatively, even if one were to construe the Referee's words at p.27 as
expressing his view that the material did not affect
his decision, that would
merely be his view. It does not follow that the Plaintiffs, had they seen the
material, would have shared
the Referee's interpretation of it; nor does it
mean that they would not have sought to have put before the Referee other
material,
and/or make relevant submissions."
<P>

31   	Finally, the Defendants contended that the making
available in Court, as they did, of the Referee for cross-examination, and
the
relevant files for inspection, "renders it impossible to give any credence to
the Plaintiffs' submissions that they may have
been in some way adversely
affected"; see the Defendants' written submissions of 20 April 1999 at page 9
para 5(k).
<P>

32   	But this presupposes first that there remains an onus on
the Plaintiffs, having demonstrated that the Referee has consulted
additional
materials which bear a direct relevance upon the valuation, to demonstrate also
that such consultation would have made
a difference to the Referee's decision
or else simply accept the Referee's say-so that there was nothing inconsistent.
That cannot
be the position for if it were this would defeat the whole purpose
of the need for procedural fairness in advising parties when material
of that
sort is to be consulted by the Referee. That is not to veto the consultation.
Rather it is to permit the parties to make
submissions and submit relevant
further evidence as to its significance, provided these remain genuinely
relevant to the questions
before the Referee.
<P>

33   	There is indeed a fundamental difficulty in the
Defendants' suggestion that the Referee should be subjected to
cross-examination
as to his reasoning process. Though the Referee is not a
judicial officer, clearly enough the Referee performs functions which are
integral to the judicial decision-making process; see <i>Najjar v Haines</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2025%20NSWLR%20224" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 25 NSWLR 224</a> per Kirby P at 223-4. It was for that reason, that the
majority (Kirby P and Rogers AJA) concluded that the referee was entitled
to
immunity from suit on that basis. Clarke JA would have allowed an immunity "at
least where there is no question of fraud or good
faith involved" (at 250).
<P>

34   	This is not because a referee is not a competent witness.
Rather it is because the Referee is not a compellable witness, or
at any rate
not compellable save in exceptional circumstances clearly not present here.
Compare the even more absolute position of
a judge. In <i>Hennessy v Broken
Hill Pty Co Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1926/32.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1926] HCA 32</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=38%20CLR%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">38 CLR 342</a> at 349 the joint judgment of Knox CJ, Gavan
Duffy and Starke JJ concluded:
<P>

"Even Judges are competent witnesses, though they may not be compellable to
testify as to matters in which they have been judicially
engaged; but their
evidence has been received upon matters which did not involve the exercise of
their judicial discretions and powers."
<P>

35   	The real reason why it would be quite inappropriate for
the Referee to be submitting himself to cross-examination is based
on the
well-settled stricture against tribunal members or, as here, those exercising a
judicial or quasi-judicial function, from
taking an active part in proceedings
such as for disqualification or concerning an alleged breach of the rules of
natural justice.
Attempts to do so are properly discouraged by the courts on
the basis that if the person concerned becomes actively involved in the
proceedings, there is a risk that his or her impartiality in the subsequent
proceedings may be endangered; <i>R v Australia Broadcasting Tribunal ex parte
Hardiman</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1980/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20144%20CLR%2013" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 144 CLR 13</a> at 35-5; Commonwealth of Australia v Human
Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20133%20ALR%20629" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 133 ALR 629</a> at 639-641.
<P>

36   	Here, it is clear that the Referee has ongoing functions;
he is not functus. Indeed the effect of my orders is to require
the Referee to
consider again the matter referred to him. It would indeed be inappropriate for
the Referee, whose impartiality is
crucial to the judicial process with which
he is connected, to have earlier given evidence for either side or to have
attempted to
justify a position that he might have taken and being
cross-examined in that regard; see generally, <i>Wentworth v Wentworth</i>
(NSWSC 317, Santow J, 9 April 1999, unreported) at paras 26, 40, 43, 47 and 48.
That is the reciprocal of immunity.
<P>

37   	Indeed there is a further difficulty which the
circumstances attending my orders brought out. That was that it could not be
said with confidence that the files brought to Court by the Defendants as the
receivership files were reliably all of the files consulted
by the Referee.
Thus to invite the Plaintiffs to inspect those files and then to indicate what
in those files they relied upon, in
order to satisfy an incorrectly imposed
onus to show that the files affected the decision of the Referee, would be both
inappropriate
and likely to lead to error. The orders that I have made ensure
that the Referee identifies reliably the documents inspected by him
from the
relevant files of the receivership and for the parties in turn to be able to
submit any evidence and submissions in respect
of those documents provided that
"such evidence and submissions [are] directly relevant to the Referee's
determination of the matter
before him".
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

38   	I am satisfied that there has in the present circumstances
been a denial to the Plaintiffs of the proper opportunity of putting
before the
Referee particulars of the contentions relied upon and an opportunity to
comment on the materials reviewed by the Referee
in the relevant files of the
receivership. I am further satisfied that this procedural unfairness can only
be appropriately remedied
by orders of the kind that I have earlier made.
<P>

<b>ALLEGED LACK OF REASONS</b>
<P>

39   	The Plaintiffs have separately contended that the Referee
failed to provide, in any manner such as exposed his reasoning process,
reasons
for the following conclusions:
<P>

(i)	that the business of ICM for the ten months ended 30.4.95 was not
profitable [para. 4.10.4]
<P>

(ii)	that on the balance of probabilities it is highly likely that the business
was incurring losses, before interest [para. 4.10.4]
<P>

(iii)	that little or no reliance can be placed on the records of ICM [para.
6.1]
<P>

(iv)	that anyone taking over the contracts of ICM in the circumstances in which
ICM found itself at the time, would have been assuming
risks higher than would
otherwise likely to have been the case and accordingly would have been looking
for an otherwise higher return
[para. 6.2].
<P>

(v)	in reducing the value of real property from $800,000 to $475,000 the valuer
failed to expose his reasoning process; see para
8.5.
<P>

40   	The Plaintiffs then contend that these findings lead the
Referee to reject the basis of valuations for which the Plaintiffs
contended
with the result that their reasonable or legitimate expectation of a sufficient
explanation had not been met thus denying
natural justice; <i>Soulemezis v
Dudley (Holdings) Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2010%20NSWLR%20247" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 10 NSWLR 247</a> at 259 and 269.
<P>

41   	In my opinion, the Plaintiffs' contentions involve a
misunderstanding of the duty to give reasons. As was said by Samuels
JA in
<i>John Strback v Narelle Newton</i> (NSWCA, 18 July 1989, unreported):
<P>

"...... there have been many cases in which it has been held that it is the
duty of the Judge or magistrate to state his reasons.
This does not mean that a
judicial officer must give his reasons in every case. It is clear that there is
no inflexible rule of universal
application that reasons should be given for
judicial decisions.
<P>

...... it is going too far to suggest that in every case a Judge must submit
the material before him or her to the most meticulous
analysis and carry into
judgment a detailed exposition of every aspect of the evidence and the
arguments ...... There is no requirement,
however, that reasons must
incorporate an extended intellectual dissertation upon the chain of reasoning
which authorises the judgment
which is given."
<P>

(cited with approval Xuereb and Anor v Viola and Ors (supra) at p.469B-D).
<P>

42   	Similarly in <i>Huntsman Chemical Company Australia Ltd v
International Pools Australia Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2036%20NSWLR%20242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 36 NSWLR 242</a> at 257 Rolfe A-JA at
257 observed:
<P>

"In my opinion the law does not require that a Judge make an express finding in
respect of every fact leading to, or relevant to,
his final conclusion of fact;
nor is it necessary that he reason, and be seen to reason, from one fact to the
next along a chain
of reasoning to that conclusion."
<P>

43   	This reasoning applies a fortiori to an expert referee.
The Referee's findings are essentially of fact, in which the Referee
necessarily must expose the general process of reasoning. But this is not
required to the point where each step in the chain of reasoning
to reach a
factual conclusion must find justification in specific reasons. It is
undoubtedly the case that the Referee here did expose
his process of reasoning
overall. The particular factual steps to his conclusions seized on by the
Plaintiffs can in truth be said
themselves to be reasons for the ultimate
conclusion. They do not themselves require further justifying reasons. Such a
process would
stultify the whole purpose of expeditious resolution via a
referee. Such findings do not, based on the principles I have earlier
set out,
require any more detailed justification than appears in the report itself.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

44   	The Plaintiffs' second basis of attack, namely,
insufficient exposure by the Referee of his reasoning in relation to the
particular
factual matters identified, is not made out.
<P>

<b>OVERALL CONCLUSION</b>
<P>

45   	This reference should now proceed in accordance with the
orders that I have earlier made, taking into account the matters
stated in
these reasons.
