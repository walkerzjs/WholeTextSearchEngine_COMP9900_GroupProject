<b>JUDGMENT  (On Order of Addresses - SCR Pt 34 r 6)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff seeks a direction under SCR Pt 34 r 6(1) as to the
order of address.
<P>

2	The context in the present case is that pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7A</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation
Act 1974</a></i>, (as amended), the jury will decide whether the programs carried
imputations and whether they are defamatory ("<i>the defamatory
imputations"</i>).
<P>

3	The further context is that the plaintiff will tender the two videotapes, to
the tender of which no objection will be taken by
the defendant;  that will be
the evidence upon which the jury questions will be decided.
<P>

4	The terms of the directions sought were articulated on 17 February by Mr
Reynolds, of Senior Counsel for the Plaintiff as follows:
<P>

	"<i>Mr Barker's suggestion is this:  for the plaintiff to go first and we are
assuming this, that there are no evidentiary difficulties,
everything is nutted
out by agreement, to open the case and for that to merge into an address and
during that process the tape or
tapes would go into evidence.  The defendant
responds to that and finally allows the plaintiff a right of reply which is a
true right
of reply, that is, counsel is confined, as he would be in the Court
of Appeal, to matters of reply and not to reopening and having
another bite on
the issues generally</i>" (T 240.46).
<P>

5	The basis for seeking such a direction, in my view, can be stated as that the
plaintiff will, if the usual procedure is followed,
be disadvantaged
forensically in that the defendant in this new, artificial and discrete trial
by jury within the trial of the actions,
not having gone into evidence, will
have  the last address to the jury on the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A</a> questions.
<P>

6	In a pre-1995 defamation action in which the jury decided whether defamatory
imputations were conveyed by the relevant matters
complained of and other
issues left to it at the end of the trial, the defendant, having gone into
evidence, would not have the right
of the last address.
<P>

7	In a pre-1995 defamation trial, but after the judgments in <b><i>Radio 2UE
Sydney Pty Limited v Parker</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2029%20NSWLR%20448" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 29 NSWLR 448</a> and <b><i>TCN Channel 9
Pty Limited v Mahoney</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2032%20NSWLR%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 32 NSWLR 397</a> where on the issues of
defamatory imputations the defendant has not gone into evidence, the practice
has been (as exemplified in<b><i> RZ Mines (Newcastle) Pty Limited &amp; Anor v
Newcastle Newspapers Pty Limited &amp; Anor</i></b> (Hunt CJ at CL, unreported,
16 November 1994),<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Harris v Perkins</i></b> 10735 of
1991), and in the absence of any application for specific directions, for the
order of addresses to follow the usual course.
<P>

8	Here we are concerned with, first, a post-1995 defamation action, and,
second, a situation where an application has been made.
<P>

9	Whilst the proposed direction limits the sought right of reply to be one in
the strict sense, no basis other than mere forensic
advantage or disadvantage
has in my opinion been advanced which persuades me to depart from the usual
order of addresses as is referred
to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/index.html#p34" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 34</a> r 6(5).
<P>

10	The reference in the course of submissions to pre-1995 and
pre-<b><i>Parker</i></b> and <b><i>Mahoney</i></b> cases is of no assistance
because, first, the legislature has intervened to create the new separate
trial, artificial as it may well
be described. Discrete, in fact, it is.
<P>

11	Secondly, that separate trial is conducted before a separate forum, namely
the jury.  Thus in the context of this case, the old
scheme, as I will describe
it, as relied upon as a basis for the directions sought, vis-a-vis the forum
constituted by the jury,
cannot apply.  But, of course, it may still apply to
the forum constituted by the trial judge.
<P>

12	Further, and of critical importance, is that the role of the trial judge and
his summing up to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.7A</a> jury cannot be overlooked.
<P>

13	It will be open to the plaintiff's counsel, at the end of the address by
counsel for the defendant, to seek any directions considered
appropriate and
required in the interests of justice in the light of such address.
<P>

14	Equally, of course, it is the duty of the trial judge fairly to present to
the jury the issues, the law, and each side's case.
<P>

15	Nothing has persuaded me to make the directions sought under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/index.html#p34" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 34</a> r 6(1)
and I decline to do so.
