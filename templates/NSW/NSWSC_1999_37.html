SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE
<P>

A deed relating to a unit trust, entered into in settlement of legal
proceedings, provided that a certain contract be entered into,
that certain
payments should be in full satisfaction of all moneys due to certain unit
holders from the trust, and that the trust
release certain loan accounts.  The
most recent approved accounts of trust did not disclose such loan accounts, but
draft accounts
had been prepared substituting those loan accounts for another
loan account.  The deed did not provide for the surrender or transfer
of the
units of the unit holders who were to receive the payments.  A contract was
later entered into which was not precisely in
the terms provided by the deed.
HELD (1) that in the circumstances of the entry into the contract, the parties
manifested an intention
that it be performance of the deed; that the deed
mainfested an intention that it proceed on the basis of the draft accounts; and
that unit holders who had no money due to them from the trust would be ordered
to surrender or transfer their units.  Consent orders
were made prior to the
hearing which included some of the final releif sought by the plaintiff.  The
defendants sought to have them
set aside on the ground that, on giving consent,
they were mistaken as to their effect.  HELD (obiter) that although the
unilateral
mistake would have been insufficient to set aside final orders, the
consent orders were closely interdependent with matters still
in issue, so
should be treated as interlocutory, and could have been set aside.

<b><u>LAURENA PTY. LIMITED &amp; ORS. V.  VILANTI PTY. LIMITED &amp;
ORS.</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR: Prior to 4th October 1995, Messrs. Lee, Wood, Milledge, Napier
and Kapeleris were partners in an accountancy business
trading as "Baker &amp;
Co.".  They conducted their business at premises in Kitchener Parade,
Bankstown, which were owned by Vilanti
Pty. Limited and Sinteria Pty. Limited,
as trustees of the Kitchener Parade Unit Trust (which I will call "KPUT").  The
unit holders
of this unit trust were Laurena Pty. Limited (a company associated
with Mr. Lee), C.J. &amp; F.J. Milledge Management Pty. Limited
(a company
associated with Mr. Milledge), I &amp; F Management Services Pty. Limited (a
company associated with Mr. Napier), and
Kapeleris Management Services Pty.
Limited (a company associated with Mr. Kapeleris).  
<P>

2	In September 1995, Messrs. Milledge, Napier and Kapeleris brought proceedings
against Messrs. Lee and Wood for the winding up
of this partnership.  These
proceedings were settled by entry into three deeds on 4th October 1995:  a Deed
of Dissolution of Partnership,
a deed relating to KPUT, and a deed relating to
Riverpine Pty. Limited (the trustee of the Riverpine Trust, to form the
partnership's
service trust).  
<P>

3	The KPUT deed provided for the first floor of the Kitchener Parade premises
to be subdivided into two lots, one of which was to
be purchased from Vilanti
and Sinteria by Messrs. Milledge and Napier.  On or about 15th August 1997, a
contract was entered into
for the sale of this lot by the Vilanti and Sinteria
to Kitchener Holdings Pty. Limited (a company associated with Messrs. Milledge
and Napier); and this contract was subsequently completed in May 1998.  
<P>

4	Messrs. Lee and Wood, and Laurena, claim that the effect of the KPUT deed was
that, upon the completion of this contract, Messrs.
Milledge, Napier and
Kapeleris had to sever their connection with Vilanti and Sinteria, and that
certain payments to be made to Milledge
Management, I &amp; F Management and
Kapeleris Management were in extinction of their respective entitlements as
unit holders in
KPUT; and in these proceedings, they seek orders giving effect
to these claims.  
<P>

5	Mr. Kapeleris and Kapeleris Management have put on a cross-claim seeking
among other things release from guarantees to Citibank
concerning a mortgage
over the Kitchener Place premises, and also payment by Mr. Lee and Laurena of
$42,592.00 plus interest arising
out of an agreement alleged to have been made
in 1986.  
<P>

	<b><u>OUTLINE OF FACTS</u></b>
<P>

6	In about 1978, Mr. Lee joined an accountancy practice which was conducted by
Peter Baker and which traded as P.A. Baker &amp;
Co.  Subsequently, Peter Baker
retired; and by about 1985, Messrs. Milledge, Napier and Kapeleris had become
partners of Mr. Lee.
 
<P>

7	Associated with this practice was KPUT, established by deed dated 10th March
1975.  Clauses 8(a) and (b) of this deed were in
the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>8(a)	The beneficial interest in the Trust Fund as originally constituted
and as existing from time to time shall be held by the Unit
Holders for the
time being in proportion to the units registered in their respective names and
all units shall at any given time
be of equal value.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(b)	Each unit shall entitle the registered holder thereof equally with
the registered holders of all other units to the beneficial
interest in the
Trust Fund as an entirety but subject thereto shall not entitle the Unit Holder
to any particular security or investment
comprised in the Trust Fund or any
part thereof and save as herein expressly provided no Unit Holder shall be
entitled to the transfer
to him of any property comprised in the Trust
Fund.</i></b>
<P>

8	Clause 21 provided that the trustees of the Trust should in each accounting
period apply the whole of the net income of the Trust
for the benefit of unit
holders in proportion to their units held.  This clause also empowered the
trustees, with the consent of
the Advisory Committee, to make interim
distributions to unit holders in proportion to the units held.  The Advisory
Committee was
established by cl.7 of the deed, and it comprised two
representatives appointed by each unit holder.  
<P>

9	Clause 22 of this deed was in the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>22.	The Trustees may if directed so to do by a unanimous resolution of
the representatives to the Advisory Committee at any time or
times and from
time to time before the date of the termination of the Trust out of the capital
of the Trust Fund held on trust as
aforesaid raise any sum or sums and pay the
same to Unit Holders in proportion to the units registered in their respective
names
as at the date of the communication of such resolution to the Trustees
for their own use and benefit in addition to any income to
which the said Unit
Holders may from time to time be entitled.</i></b>
<P>

10	It would appear that prior to 31st May 1985, fifty percent of the units were
owned by Laurena, and the other fifty percent by
Isthmus Holdings Pty. Limited,
a company associated with one William Watson.  On 31st May 1985, the directors
of Isthmus Holdings
resolved to transfer its fifty percent for $55,253.00, in
the following proportions:  2% to Laurena for $2,210.00; and 15% to each
of
Milledge Management, I &amp; F Management and Kapeleris Management for
$17,681.00.  Following that transaction, 52% of the units
were held by Laurena,
and 16% by each of the other three companies.  
<P>

11	At some time in or prior to 1985, KPUT acquired land at 80 Kitchener Parade
for a cost recorded in its accounts as $147,284.00.
 In about 1985,
construction was commenced on this site of a two-storey office building, which
came to be known as the Kitchener
Centre, with the intention that the upper
floor would be used for the accountancy practice.  The ground floor was to
consist of nine
strata units, and it was proposed that these units be allocated
to the unit holders by reference to their proportionate entitlements.
 The
upper floor was to be a single unit, known as Lot 10.  
<P>

12	At some time prior to 11th July 1986, Mr. Lee agreed with Mr. Kapeleris that
he or Laurena would purchase Mr. Kapeleris' interest
in the ground floor units,
such agreement providing for an immediate payment of $50,000.00; and there is a
dispute as to whether
the agreement also provided for some further payment.
Thereafter, it appears that the shares in one of the KPUT trustees, namely
Vilanti, came to be held by Messrs. Lee, Milledge and Napier in the proportions
68/16/16, with Messrs. Lee, Milledge and Napier being
directors of that
company; and the shares in the other trustee Sinteria came to be held by
Messrs. Lee, Milledge, Napier and Kapeleris
in the proportions 52/16/16/16,
with Messrs. Lee, Milledge, Napier and Kapeleris being directors of that
company.  
<P>

13	At around the same time of the transaction between Mr. Lee and Mr.
Kapeleris, there were discussions between Messrs. Lee, Milledge
and Napier as
to the allocation of ground floor units.  This proceeded on the basis that Mr.
Lee or his company were entitled to
68% of those units, and Messrs. Milledge
and Napier or their companies entitled to 16% each.  It appears from a document
in Mr. Milledge's
handwriting (Exhibit L16) that negotiations were at least
initially based on a value of $50,000.00, being attributed to a 16% interest
in
the ground floor units, on the assumption that Messrs. Lee, Milledge and Napier
or their companies would each undertake liability
for their respective shares
of the Trust's mortgage liability attributable to the ground floor units
allocated to them.  This in
turn was based on a split of 46% of the mortgage to
the upper floor, and 54% to the ground floor.  
<P>

14	In the result, it was agreed that Mr. Lee should be allocated units 3, 4, 5,
7, 8 and 9, Mr. Milledge units 1 and 6, and Mr.
Napier unit 2, in conjunction
with payments by Mr. Milledge of $13,500.00 to Mr. Lee and $10,000.00 to Mr.
Napier.  (The calculations
in Exhibit L16 proposed a payment by Mr. Milledge to
Mr. Lee of $11,954.00, and to Mr. Napier of $8,778.00; so the ultimate figures
agreed on appear to add about one-eighth to the calculations based on a value
of $50,000.00 being attributed to 16% of the ground
floor units).  
<P>

15	According to a document dated 11th July 1986, signed by Messrs. Lee,
Milledge and Napier, the mortgage loan was to be apportioned
according to sale
values stated as follows:  
<P>

	<b><i>Unit No		           Sale Value	Per Sq.Ft.           	No.of
Sq.Ft</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	1			144,240		250		601</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	2			144,480		250		602</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	3			156,480		250		652</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	4			133,540		230		607</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	5			123,690		200		651</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	6			127,800		210		639</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	7			127,800		210		639</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	8			127,800		210		639</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	9			100,825		200		545</i></b>
<P>

16	I note that if one divides the sale value in each case by the area in square
feet of each unit, one gets a value per square foot
different from that stated
in the table.  In fact, the value obtained in exactly $10.00 less than that
stated in the table, except
in the case of unit 9 where it is $15.00 less.  It
appears that another document was prepared by Mr. Milledge showing values
worked
out correctly at the above rates, except in relation to units 5 and 9
which were worked out at rates of $210.00 per square foot each.
 
<P>

17	There are in evidence a number of contracts each dated 16th December 1986
for the sale of ground floor units by the trustees
Vilanti and Sinteria to
Milledge Management and to Laurena.  The Milledge Management contracts were for
the sale of lot 1 for $87,369.00
and lot 6 for $78,011.00.  The Laurena
contracts were for the sale of lot 3 for $94,826.00, lot 4 for $81,228.00, lot
5 for $79,473.00,
lot 7 for $78,011.00, lot 8 for $78,084.00, and lot 9 for
$66,605.00.  It is clear that the purchase price in each case was the share
of
the mortgage liability allocated at that time to the respective unit.  It would
appear that there may have been a similar contract
for the sale of unit 2 to
Mr. Napier, but this is not in evidence.  
<P>

18	These contracts were plainly not arm's-length contracts, and the price in
each case was less than the value of the unit.  It
appears that a valuation was
obtained as at 16th December 1986 for stamp duty purposes.  According to this
valuation, the value of
lot 1 was $100,000.00, of lot 2 $107,000.00, of lot 4
$102,000.00, lot 5 $93,000.00, lot 6 $95,000.00, lot 7 $95,000.00, lot 8
$95,000.00,
and lot 9 $87,000.00.  
<P>

19	Subsequently (perhaps in about July 1988), unit 2 was sold to a third party
for $156,500.00; and Mr. Napier or his company got
the benefit of that sale,
less the amount of the mortgage attributed to unit 2.  
<P>

20	Milledge Management completed its purchase of lots 1 and 6 (perhaps in about
June 1991), with the result that it became the registered
proprietor of units 1
and 6.  
<P>

21	Laurena's contracts were rescinded by a formal agreement executed on 24th
November 1987.  Some acknowledgement of Mr. Lee's or
Laurena's rights in
relation to the six units previously subject to those contracts is contained in
a memorandum dated 29th November
1990 addressed to Mr. Lee from "SJC", which
bears the signatures of Messrs. Lee, Milledge, Napier and Kapeleris.  That
memorandum
is in the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>I understand from Des that there are nine individual strata units on the
ground floor of 80 Kitchener Parade.  Two of these are owned
by Chris, one by a
doctor and the other six are in the name of The Kitchener Parade Unit Trust
(The Unit Trust).</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	The Kitchener Parade Unit Trust is owned in various proportions by the
partners' entities and Des's entity holds 52% of the Units
in the Unit Trust.
However it is the understanding of all the partners that the six Units in the
name of The Unit Trust on the ground
floor "in reality" belong to
Des.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	It would be possible to transfer these Units out of the Kitchener Parade
Unit Trust to Des's Trust, however all sorts of stamp duty
and capital gains
tax implications would arise.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	In order to formalise in some way Des's entitlement to the six Units I
suggest a Deed between all the partners, all the unit holders
in the Unit Trust
and the Trustees of the Unit Trust which would in effect say the
following:-</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	1.	That the Trustees would deal with the six units as Des may direct
from time to time including selling, leasing and mortgaging.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	2.	The proceeds of a sale or of a loan advance on a mortgage of the
units would be dealt with by the Trustees as Des may direct.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>		The Trustees and all the other parties to the Deed would acknowledge
that they would account to Des for any after tax profit of
either capital or
income arising from rental or sale of the six units.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	4.	In the event of a mortgage and any other party other than Des is
obliged to provide a personal guarantee on the borrowings then
Des is to
provide suitable indemnities.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	I look forward to your views.</i></b>
<P>

22	It appears therefore that Messrs. Milledge and Napier in one way or another
received the benefit of the difference between the
true value of the ground
floor units allocated to them and the amount of the mortgage attributed to
those units:  in Mr. Napier's
case, something like $70,000.00 for unit 2, in
addition to the $10,000.00 he had been paid by Mr. Milledge.  In addition to
this
actual benefit received by them, capital profits were recorded in the
books of the Trust, being the difference between the cost of
each unit as it
appeared in those books, and the amount received for each unit by the Trust,
being the amount of the mortgage attributed
to that unit; and this capital
profit was allocated to the unit holders in proportion to their holdings (that
is in the proportions
52/16/16/16).  These book profits were never actually
paid out in cash, but were reflected in loan accounts of the unit holders in
the trust.  
<P>

23	Also associated with the accountancy practice was the Riverpine Trust, the
service trust for the practice at all times between
1985 and October 1995.  The
discretionary beneficiaries of the Riverpine Trust included the partners and
KPUT.  During the construction
of the Kitchener Centre, KPUT incurred losses;
and the distribution of profits which were made by the Riverpine Trust during
this
time were made to KPUT, so as to result in a break-even trading position.
This distribution was given effect to by loans being made
from KPUT to the
Riverpine Trust.  
<P>

24	In 1989, Mr. Wood joined the practice, and became a unit holder of the
Riverpine Trust.  It appears that there continued to be
distributions of the
profits from the Riverpine Trust to KPUT (in which Mr. Wood had no interest);
but adjustments were made so that
this procedure did not disadvantage Mr. Wood.

<P>

25	By 30th June 1991, the loan from KPUT to the Riverpine Trust amounted to
$603,194.00.  The accounts of KPUT as at that date showed
money owing by KPUT
to unit holders as follows:  to Laurena, $52,834.00; to Milledge Management
$31,172.00; to I &amp; F Management
$43,692.00; and to Kapeleris Management
$31,172.00.  Up to the time of preparation of those accounts, Mr. Milledge had
undertaken
responsibility for the preparation of accounts.  From that time
onwards, Mr. Napier undertook that responsibility.  In the accounts
for the
year ended 30th June 1994, the loan from KPUT to the Riverpine Trust had
increased to $664,821.00; and the money owing by
KPUT to the unit holders'
companies was $17,152.00 to Laurena; $8,836.00 to Milledge Management;
$2,459.00 to I &amp; F Management;
and $8,836.00 to Kapeleris Management.  The
accounts also showed a loan from KPUT to I &amp; F Management of $64,689.00,
which was
the balance owing by Mr. Napier's company of the mortgage liability
allocated to unit 2.  
<P>

26	Two rival versions have been prepared of the accounts of KPUT for the year
ended 30th June 1995.  According to Mr. Lee's version,
the loan to Riverpine
Trust was reduced to $610,097.00, apparently by some procedure of set-off
against the loans from the unit holders'
companies, those loans being shown as
having been repaid.  The loan to I &amp; F Management remained the same, that
is $64,689.00.
 
<P>

27	According to a version prepared by Mr. Napier, the loan to Riverpine Trust
had been repaid, and replaced by loans from KPUT to
the unit holders'
companies, in the following amounts:  $304,132.00 to Laurena; $91,598.00 to
Milledge Management; $113,521.00 to
I &amp; F Management; and $91,598.00 to
Kapeleris Management.  The loan to I &amp; F Management of $64,689.00 remained
the same,
being additional to the other loan of $113,521.00.  
<P>

28	In both versions of the accounts, the only other assets of the Trust (apart
from goodwill at cost $994.00) were the fixed assets
of the Kitchener Parade
property and its fixtures and fittings (shown at around $500,000.00) and cash
shown at about $10,000.00;
and the only liabilities were about $1.16 million
owed to Citibank, and current liabilities, described as creditors and bonds, of
about $10,000.00.
<P>

29	In mid-1985, Baker &amp; Co. occupied about half of the upper floor of the
building, and the balance of this floor was leased
to a client of the practice
Hood Favco.  Hood Favco was due to vacate the premises in about September or
October 1995.  
<P>

30	On or about 16th August 1995, there was a meeting between Messrs. Lee,
Milledge, Napier and Kapeleris, purportedly as directors
of the trustees
Vilanti and Sinteria, attended also by Mr. Wood.  Over Mr. Lee's opposition, a
resolution was passed to grant a lease
of the premises occupied by Hood Favco
to a company described as KMN &amp; Associates Pty. Limited, a company
associated with Messrs.
Kapeleris, Milledge and Napier.  It appears that
Messrs. Kapeleris, Milledge and Napier left Baker &amp; Co. in about October
1995,
and commenced trading in those premises.  
<P>

31	As mentioned earlier, in September 1995, Messrs. Milledge, Napier and
Kapeleris brought proceedings in this Court for the dissolution
of Baker &amp;
Co.  Those proceedings were settled, and three deeds were executed on 4th
October 1995.  
<P>

32	The deed most significant for these proceedings is that called the "Deed
Relating to Kitchener Unit Trust", entered into between
the five individual
partners, the trustees Vilanti and Sinteria, and the four unit holder

that Citibank, as part of its
security with respect to a loan to the trustees, held a registered first
mortgage over what the deed
referred to as "the Premises", defined to be lot
10; and that Messrs. Lee, Kapeleris, Milledge and Napier had personally
guaranteed
that loan.  Recital L stated "agreement has been reached in relation
to the use, occupation and ownership of the premises on the
terms and
conditions of this Deed".  Part 3 of the deed contained the covenants of the
deed, and it is necessary to set this out

33	The contract in the First Schedule to this deed was the 1992 edition of the
Law Society Real Estate Institute form.  The property
was described in the
contract as part of lot 10 designated in an annexed plan:  no such plan was
annexed.  The purchaser was described
as Messrs. Milledge and Napier "as

name is not acceptable
to the Australian Securities Commission then as trustees
for such other name as is acceptable".  The price was given as $384,000.00.

dissolved the partnership as at 27th September 1995.  "Trustees" was defined to
mean Vilanti and Sinteria;
and "Unit Trust" was defined to mean KPUT.  The
"Premises Deed" was defined to mean the deed which I have just been describing.
Covenant
11.4 of this deed was in the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>Other than to comply with the provisions of the Premises Deed, Lee and
KMN agree that no change shall be made to the shareholding,

<P>

<b><i>	(l)	they shall convene and pass appropriate resolutions by Riverpine to
give effect to the provisions of this Deed including but
not limited to a
resolution distributing the plant and equipment in specie and in accordance
with the Third Schedule.</i></b>
<P>

37	The stipulation referred to in par.(j) of covenant 12.4 was contained in
covenant 8 of the deed, which dealt only with furniture,
plant and equipment.

<P>

38	The third deed executed on 4th October 1995 was entitled "Deed Relating to
Riverpine Pty. Limited and the Riverpine Trust". 
Recital F of this deed was in
the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>F.	Pursuant to the Deed of Dissolution, the Partners have agreed to
procure the winding-up of the Riverpine Trust, the vesting of
its property and
distribution of its assets pursuant to the terms of the Trust Deed and the

39	Recital H was as follows:
<P>

	<b><i>Riverpine has agreed to enter into this Deed with the Partners in order
to give effect to the intentions recited above and contemplated

<P>

40	Covenant 4 of that deed dealt with the distribution of trust property, with
4.1 dealing with equipment, as set out in the Second

cl.4.2 dealing with "any surplus cash".  Covenant 6 of the deed was in the

<P>

	<b><i>Other Liabilities</i></b>
<P>

provision has not been made in this Deed shall be discharged
from funds held by
Riverpine at the date of this Deed for its own purposes, or those of the Trust,
as the case may be.</i></b>
<P>

41	There was delay in preparation of the plan of subdivision contemplated by
Covenant 1 of the KPUT deed, and particularly in preparation
of the associated
s.88B instrument.  In a letter dated 11th July 1996 from KMN Accountants (the
name under which Messrs. Kapeleris,
Milledge and Napier were then trading) to
Mr. Lee, it was requested that Mr. Lee forward the linen plan for the
subdivision to a
surveyor to enable him to conclude the s.88B document and
subsequently lodge the strata plan with Bankstown Council.  The letter
concluded with the following paragraph:
<P>

	<b><i>If this document is not forwarded to the Independent Surveyor with seven
(7) days this would indicate to us that you do not wish to
proceed with the
terms of the "Strata Title Subdivision" as indicated in the Property Deed of
Dissolution.  In these circumstances,
to protect the interests of the Unit
Holders, Lease Agreements should be obtained immediately from the 1st floor
tenants.</i></b>
<P>

42	It was not until June 1997 that agreement was reached on the plan and the
associated s.88 instrument.  The portion of lot 10
to be purchased by the
Milledge and Napier interests was shown on that plan as lot 11, and the portion
to be retained by the trustees
was shown as lot 12.  A draft contract was
submitted to the Milledge and Napier interests in about June 1997; and, at the
request
of Messrs. Milledge and Napier, this contract showed the purchaser as
Kitchener Holdings Pty. Limited.  
<P>

43	By letter dated 27th June 1997, Birch Partners (solicitors acting for the
purchaser) requested certain amendments to the draft
contract, and in pursuing
those requests referred to Covenant 4 of the KPUT deed.  
<P>

44	In a letter dated 3rd July 1997 from Mr. Lee to Citibank, proposals were
made as to amounts to be paid in association with completion
of this contract.
In the result, it was agreed that Citibank would give a discharge of mortgage
in relation to lot 11 on being paid
$64,689.00 (the proportion of the loan
attributed to lot 2) and $290,000.00, the proportion attributed to lot 11).  By
a letter dated
12th August 1997 from KMN Accountants to Citibank, there was
agreement expressed to matters in a letter from Citibank dated 6th August
1997,
including Condition 2 which was to the effect that guarantees of the loan given
by Messrs. Kapeleris, Milledge and Napier would
be released.  
<P>

45	The contract was dated 15th August 1997.  It differed in some respects from
the contract in the First Schedule to the KPUT deed.
 It was in the 1996
edition of the Law Society Real Estate Institute form.  It introduced Special
Conditions 23 to 26, in the following
terms:
<P>

	<b><i>23(a)	The vendor agrees to accept the sum of $1,296.00 as deposit in
this Contract.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	24(a)	The purchaser shall pay the balance of $382.704.00 ("the balance")
on completion and the vendor hereby directs the purchaser
to pay the balance by
the following cheques:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(i)	$290,000.00 in favour of Citibank by Bank Cheque;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(ii)	$30,901.00 in favour of C.J. &amp; F.J. Milledge Management Pty.
Limited by ordinary cheque;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(iii)	$30,901.00 in favour of I &amp; F Management Services Pty. Limited
by ordinary cheque;</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(iv)	$30,902.00 in favour of Kapeleris Management Services Pty. Limited
by ordinary cheque.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	25(a)	The vendor shall, on completion, in addition to the amount
referred to in Clause 24(a) pay to Citibank the amount of $1,296.00
and the
purchaser hereby gives authority to the stakeholder to account to Citibank on
completion for the said amount of $1,296.00.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	26(a)	The purchaser, in consideration of the vendor entering into this
Contract, shall pay to Citibank on completion the sum of $64,689.00,
in
addition to the purchase price, but the vendor acknowledges that the payment by
the purchaser is on behalf of I &amp; F Management
Services Pty. Limited as
trustee for I &amp; F Management Services Trust.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(b)	The vendor, upon the payment being made in Clause 26(a), shall, if
required by I &amp; F Management Services Pty. Limited, on
completion execute a
form of discharge acknowledging that I &amp; F Management Services Pty. Limited
indebtedness to the Kitchener
Parade Unit Trust is reduced by
$64,689.00.</i></b>
<P>

46	It appears that prior to the entry into this contract, each of Messrs.
Milledge, Napier and Kapeleris were paying about $1,035.00
per month towards
mortgage repayments in respect of the first floor of the Kitchener Parade
premises.  It appears that they ceased
making these contributions at around the
time the contract was entered into.  
<P>

47	On 26th November 1997, Mr. Lee wrote to Messrs. Napier, Milledge and
Kapeleris a letter in the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>I tried speaking to you yesterday regarding finalising the problems
regarding the accounts of the above, to allow the transfer to
take

48	The problems regarding the accounts referred to in that letter arose from
the rival versions of the KPUT accounts for the year
ended 30th June 1995 to
which I have referred previously.  Mr. Lee, pursuant to Covenant 6(a) of the
KPUT deed, had prepared accounts
for KPUT for the year ended 30th June 1995 and
30th June 1996, and submitted them to the other parties in about December 1996.
These
were disputed.  A meeting of directors of the trustees took place on 7th
February 1997, and at that meeting the finalisation of these
accounts was
deferred.  It appears that that matter was not much advanced between then and
26th November 1997 when Mr. Lee wrote
his letter. 
<P>

49	On 27th November 1997, Birch Partners wrote to Heaney Richardson &amp;
Nemes, who were then acting as solicitors for the vendors,
confirming that
settlement was to take place on 28th November 1997.  However, on 28th November
1997 Heaney Richardson &amp; Nemes
wrote to Birch Partners to the effect that
"our client" (meaning Mr. Lee) would settle only if "your clients" (meaning
Messrs. Milledge,
Napier and Kapeleris) resign as directors from KPUT and
transfer their units in the Trust to Mr. Lee.  This communication noted that
the accounts in the unit trust had been altered as per "your clients' request".

<P>

50	On 1st December 1997, Birch Partners wrote to Heaney Richardson &amp; Nemes
to the effect that there was no provision in the
contract for any such
resignation and transfer, and enclosing a Notice to Complete requiring
completion on 17th December 1997.  Heaney
Richardson &amp; Nemes responded on
3rd December 1997, asserting that the overall agreement between the parties
required the resignation
and transfers.  In their response of 8th December
1997, Birch Partners denied that there was such an overall agreement, and
questioned
the authority of Heaney Richardson &amp; Nemes to make such
assertions on behalf of the vendors, namely the trustees Vilanti and
Sinteria.

<P>

51	On 16th December 1997, KMN Accountants wrote to Heaney Richardson &amp;
Nemes asserting that a meeting of the Boards of the trustees
on 15th December
1997 had resolved to withdraw the trustees' retainer of Heaney Richardson &amp;
Nemes as solicitors for the vendors,
and to appoint Stockman &amp; Evans in
their place.  By a letter of the same date from Birch Partners from Stockman
&amp; Evans,
the Notice to Complete was extended to 3pm on 17th December 1997.

<P>

52	By letter dated 18th December 1997, from Heaney Richardson &amp; Nemes to
Stockman &amp; Evans, it was asserted that in the view
of Heaney Richardson
&amp; Nemes their retainer had not been terminated.  In a letter of the same
date from Heaney Richardson &amp;
Nemes to Birch Partners, the same assertion
was made, and an appointment was made to settle the contract on 22nd December
"on the
basis that the sale to your clients will be completed as contemplated
by the 1995 Deed".  
<P>

53	On 19th December 1997, Birch Partners wrote to Heaney Richardson &amp; Nemes
a letter in the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>We confirm that we act for KMN.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	We refer to your fax letter dated 18 inst.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Mr. Lee and the vendor companies are in breach of an essential term of
the Deed, in that the Citibank loan was not and has not been
refinanced within
the specified 6 month period.  Therefore our clients consider that Mr. Lee and
the vendor companies have repudiated
the deed.  The deed is at an end and our
clients reserve their rights to claim damages arising out of the
repudiation.</i></b>
<P>

54	There were between November 1997 and February 1998 a number of requests on
behalf of the Milledge, Napier and Kapeleris interests
to Mr. Lee to submit
further accounts for KPUT; but no such accounts were submitted by Mr. Lee until
February 1998.  These accounts,
when they were submitted, were not changed as
foreshadowed in the letter of 26th November 1997, but rather continued to show
a debt
of over $600,000.00 owing by Riverpine.  
<P>

55	These proceedings were commenced on 5th March 1998.  The contract for the
sale of lot 11 was completed on 15th May 1998, without
prejudice to the
positions of the parties in these proceedings.  
<P>

56	Consent orders were made in these proceedings on 4th June 1998, including an
order that Messrs. Milledge and Napier specifically
perform their respective
obligations pursuant to Covenant 5 of the KPUT deed.  There is some discussion
of these orders and of their
effect in a judgment which I gave on 3rd July
1998.
<P>

<b><u>ISSUES</u></b>
<P>

57	The following issues have been debated in these proceedings.  
<P>

58	First, there is the issue whether the KPUT deed is still in force.  For the
defendants, it has been contended that the effect
of Covenant 5(f)(a) is that
the plaintiffs' interests are in fundamental breach, and cannot now enforce the
deed.  Furthermore, it
has been contended on behalf of Messrs. Milledge and
Napier that the contract made on 15th August 1997 was not a contract giving
effect to the KPUT deed, but rather was entered into independently of it.
There is also the issue raised by the plaintiffs that the
consent orders of 4th
June 1998 mean that the defendants cannot assert that the KPUT deed is no
longer in force:  this raises a question
of interpretation of the orders, and
also may require consideration of a cross-claim brought by the defendants to
set aside these
consent orders.  
<P>

59	Secondly, there are issues as to what is now required by the KPUT deed, if
it is effective and still in force.  There is a question
as to whether Milledge
Management, I &amp; F Management and Kapeleris Management are obliged to
transfer their units in the Trust.
 There is a question as to the effect of the
release of debts contained in the KPUT deed, particularly as it relates to the
dispute
as to the correct accounts of KPUT:  on the Napier version, substantial
debts owing to KPUT by Milledge Management, I &amp; F Management
and Kapeleris
Management are released; whereas on the Lee version, there are no such debts
which are released, but rather a debt
from Riverpine which is not released.  In
association with this question, there has been an application to amend
pleadings and lead
further evidence to support the Napier version.  
<P>

60	Next, there is a claim by the plaintiffs for damages arising out of alleged
failures of the defendants to contribute to expenses
incurred by the trustees,
including expenses in relation to mortgage repayments attributable to lot 11
between the date of the contract
and the date of completion.  
<P>

61	Thirdly, there are other defences.  Delay and laches have been pleaded.  In
the application to amend referred to earlier, it
is sought to include in the
defence by the Milledge and Napier interests an allegation of lack of
readiness, willingness and ability
on the part of the plaintiffs, and
particularly the Lee interests, to perform their obligations under the
contract.  There may be
a question as to whether this can be relied on without
the amendment, in circumstances where readiness, willingness and ability is
not
alleged in the Statement of Claim.  
<P>

62	Fourthly and finally, there is the Cross-claim by the Kapeleris interests.
Some issues raised by this cross-claim fall within
the earlier issues,
particularly those concerning release of the Kapeleris interests from
guarantees of the Citibank loan, and the
taking of accounts.  The issue which
the cross-claim raises independently of other issues is the claim against the
Lee interests
for $42,592.00 plus interest.  
<P>

63	I will deal first with the first three issues I have identified, leaving
aside the issue of rectification concerning the question
whether the KPUT deed
requires transfer of units, the application for amendment, and the application
to set aside the consent orders.
 Then I will deal with those excepted matters,
in so far as it is necessary to do so.  Finally, I will deal with Mr.
Kapeleris' cross-claim.
<P>

	<b><u>WHAT, IF ANY, IS THE CURRENT EFFECT OF THE KPUT DEED</u>?</b>
<P>

<b>	<u>Submissions</u></b>
<P>

64	Written submissions have been provided on behalf of all parties, and I will
leave them with the papers.  I have read and considered
them carefully, but I
will only outline them in this judgment.  
<P>

65	Mr. Smallbone for the plaintiffs submitted that the contract of sale to
Kitchener Holdings was the contract provided in Covenant
2.1 of the KPUT deed.
The differences were not substantial, and under Covenant 2.1 the contract had
only to be "substantially" in
the terms of the contract in the Schedule.  The
change of the purchaser's name was made at the request of Messrs. Milledge and
Napier.
 Alterations to the terms were requested by the purchaser's solicitor
on the basis of the KPUT deed.  Messrs. Milledge, Napier and
Kapeleris
acknowledged in their letter to Citibank that they were to get a release of
their guarantees, to which they had no entitlement
apart from the KPUT deed.
Under the contract, they were to get about $30,000.00 each, an entitlement
which could only be explained
by the KPUT deed.  
<P>

66	As for Covenant 5(f)(a), that was subject to the preamble to Covenant 5, and
accordingly meant that the release had to be given
on completion of the
contract or six months after the date of the deed, whichever was the later.  In
any event, even if there had
been a breach of Covenant 5(f)(a), there had been
no election to terminate; and the KPUT deed had been affirmed by entry into the
contract.  The purported termination of 15th December 1997 was accordingly too
late.  
<P>

67	Covenant 4.2(b) meant that receipt of the amounts referred to, being in full
satisfaction of all moneys which may be due to them
from the Trust, was a
payment out of their entitlements as unit holders.  In equity, they previously
had no entitlement to the remaining
downstairs units, so it was appropriate
that realisation of their beneficial interests in 48% of the upper floor would
discharge
all their entitlements as unit holders.  
<P>

68	Covenant 3.1(a) required them to pay expenses, including the Citibank
payments of $1,035.00 per month.  The Napier interests
were also liable for
$642.40 per month in relation to the portion of the mortgage allocated to unit
2.  It was foreseeable that failure
to make these payments could cause
financial embarrassment to Mr. Lee, so the defendants were also liable for
additional loss caused
to Mr. Lee in relation to his divorce settlement.  
<P>

69	For the defendants, it was submitted by Mr. Darvall and Mr. Zammit that
Covenant 4.2(c) of the deed showed that the Napier version
of the accounts was
correct, otherwise there were no loan accounts which could be released.  This
was confirmed by Covenant 4.4(g)
of the Dissolution Deed, and Covenant 11(g) of
the Riverpine deed, both of which contemplate that the partners' loan accounts
in
Riverpine would be in credit.  Covenant 4.2(b) did not mean that their
entitlements as unit holders would be discharged.  There were
capital
distributions due to the Milledge, Napier and Kapeleris interests from KPUT,
namely those which would flow from realisation
of the downstairs units and of
lot 12, even on the basis that the downstairs unit would be sold to the Lee
interests for the amount
of the mortgage attributable to them.  There had been
such capital distributions concerning the sale for the mortgage allocation
to
Mr. Milledge of lots 1 and 6 and to the Napier interests of lot 2.
<P>

70	Covenant 5(f)(a) was not subject to the preamble to Covenant 5, and required
absolutely that there be performance within six
months.  Plainly it was not
complied with.  Rescission was effected by the letter of 11th July 1996, or
alternatively the letter
of 19th December 1997.  
<P>

71	The contract to purchase lot 11 was entered independently of the KPUT deed.
Special condition 24, providing for payment of $30,901.00
each, displaced
cl.4.2(b) and did not provide that the payment was to be "in full satisfaction"
of unit holders' entitlements.  In
any event, such payment was only in respect
of the sale of lot 11, or alternatively was on account of capital entitlements
as above.
 
<P>

72	The plaintiffs were not entitled to specific performance, because they have
not at appropriate times been ready willing and able
to perform the contract
themselves, and were not now ready willing and able.  The Lee interests would
complete the contract for the
sale of lot 11 only if the units were
transferred, and there was no obligation on the defendants to do this.
Furthermore, Mr. Lee
had failed to prepare the accounts of KPUT on the proper
basis, that is on the basis of Mr. Napier's version of the accounts.  
<P>

73	On the question of damages, Covenant 3.1(a) was an obligation enforceable by
the trustees, not by the plaintiffs.  If it related
to gross expenses,
provision of those expenses would add to the profit, and 48% would have to be
returned to the defendants.  Failure
to pay the expenses was not established by
the evidence.  The instalments included some payments of principal, to which
the plaintiffs
were not entitled.  In relation to other items claimed in a
schedule produced on behalf of the plaintiffs, it was submitted that
costs of
$1,051.00 paid to Mr. Heidtman had been paid by Kitchener Holdings Pty.
Limited.  The valuation fee of $1,200.00 to Citibank
was payable by the Lee
interests.  The costs of Heaney Richardson &amp; Nemes included work done for
the Lee interests as well as
work done for the trustees; in any event, there
had been no proper appointment of Heaney Richardson &amp; Nemes by the
trustees;
and there had been no proper accounts rendered, and the accounts had
not been assessed.  In relation to the claim for monthly contributions
in
respect of unit 2 by the Napier interests, there was no obligation to make such
payments in the KPUT deed, and the liability for
such payments was caused by
delay by the Lee interests in entering into and completing the contract.
Additional expenses incurred
by Mr. Lee because of financial embarrassment in
relation to his divorce settlement were too remote.
<P>

	<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

74	It is probable that the parties to the Deed expected that the contract would
be completed within six months, and did not expressly
consider how Covenant
5(f)(a) was to operate if it were not completed within six months.  It could be
argued that, by making Covenant
5(f)(a) "an essential term", the parties
intended it to operate before completion, if completion was delayed beyond six
months. 
However, I think the better view is that Covenant 5(f)(a) is subject
to the preamble in Covenant 5.  It refers to the "remainder
of the Citibank
loan", which must mean the remainder <i>after what is paid on completion</i>.
Accordingly, in my opinion, the release must be provided either within six
months or on the completion of the contract, whichever
is the later.  
<P>

75	In my opinion, the contract relating to lot 11 was entered into in order to
give effect to Covenant 5.  In my opinion, the change
of name of the purchaser
was not material.  I note that the contract in the first schedule to the KPUT
deed had Messrs. Milledge
and Napier as purchasers only as trustees for a
company which they were to incorporate, so the naming of the purchaser as a
company
specified and requested by Messrs. Milledge and Napier gave effect
almost precisely to the terms of the deed.  Furthermore, the deed
provided that
the terms of the contract were to be "substantially" as provided in the
schedule.  In my opinion also, as submitted
by Mr. Smallbone, Messrs. Milledge,
Napier and Kapeleris manifested an intention that the contract be pursuant to
the KPUT deed by
seeking release of their guarantees by Citibank, and by Birch
Partners negotiating the terms of the contract in reliance on provisions
of the
KPUT deed.  In my opinion also, the provision that the Milledge, Napier and
Kapeleris interests each received about $30,000.00
is explicable only on the
basis that the contract was giving effect to the KPUT deed.  
<P>

76	This means that the entry into this contract (which was signed by Mr.
Kapeleris on behalf of one of the vendors) was an affirmation
of the KPUT deed;
so that even if there had been a breach of Covenant 5(f)(a), the only purported
rescission relying on breach of
that covenant, namely that of 19th December
1997, was too late.  
<P>

77	I note that Messrs. Milledge and Napier said in evidence that they believed,
in August 1997, that the KPUT deed was no longer
valid, that they were entering
into the contract independently of it, and that special conditions 23-26 were
included for that reason.
 (Mr. Kapeleris, on the other hand, swore that he
believed the contract was giving effect to the KPUT deed).  In
cross-examination,
Mr. Napier tried to explain the payment of $30,000.00 as
being a loan on account of a capital profit realised on the sale of lot
11, of
which his share was $87,013.00 or $42,726.00 (see Exhibit MN6); and that this
was put to Mr. Lee.  Similar evidence was given
by Mr. Milledge.  Indeed, both
went so far as suggesting that this had been the original intention of Covenant
4.2(b) of the KPUT
deed.  
<P>

78	I reject this evidence of Messrs. Milledge and Napier.  In my opinion, it is
probably deliberately false, but at best it is a
very substantial
reconstruction.  It is not believable at all that they had that view of the
KPUT deed at the time it was executed.
 They did not assert in their affidavits
that the $30,000.00 was a loan, or that it was put to Mr. Lee that it was to be
a loan;
and in my opinion, this was not said to Mr. Lee.  In my opinion, this
evidence is inconsistent with their conduct, at the time of
entry into the
contract, in seeking release from Citibank of their guarantees.  It is also
inconsistent with the letter written by
their solicitors, negotiating terms of
the contract on the basis of the KPUT deed.  Even if I were wrong in rejecting
this evidence
as to their subjective belief, for reasons I have already given
their objective conduct plainly manifested an intention that the
contract be a
performance of the KPUT deed.  
<P>

79	Turning to the rival versions of the KPUT accounts, I accept that Mr.
Napier's changes to the KPUT accounts were never approved
by the directors of
the KPUT trustees.  However, in my opinion it is plain that the entry into the
KPUT deed manifested an intention
that this deed operate on the KPUT accounts
substantially as altered by Mr. Napier.  Otherwise, Covenant 4.2(c) dealing
with the
release of loan accounts would be meaningless, there being no such
loan accounts on Mr. Lee's version.  Furthermore, on the Lee version
of the
accounts, any notion that a distribution of the surplus on the sale of lot 11
to the Milledge, Napier and Kapeleris interests
should be "in full satisfaction
of all moneys which may be due to them from the Kitchener Trust", would be
grossly inappropriate:
 there would be a very large assets of the trust, namely
the debt of over $600,000.00 due by Riverpine, to which in fairness each
of
those interests should have a 16% entitlement.  This was explained by Mr. Lee
as having been overlooked by him.  The same position
would apply in relation to
the alternative contract, which was to be entered into if a subdivision was not
approved, and in relation
to which the distribution to the Lee interests as
well as the other interests was to be in full satisfaction of all moneys which
may be due to the Lee interests from the Kapeleris trusts.  This would leave
the Riverpine debt as something to which no-one would
apparently have had any
entitlement.  
<P>

80	Furthermore, the changes to the accounts were made by the person with the
responsibility for preparing the accounts, and were
available to the Lee
interests at the time of entering into the KPUT deed.  Either Mr. Lee utilised
this availability and knew of
the alterations; or alternatively did not utilise
it, when it would be reasonable to expect that a person entering into such a
deed
would have looked into the state of accounts of the trust.  On any
approach, in my opinion, Mr. Lee and his interests manifested
an intention that
the deed apply to accounts substantially as altered by Mr.Napier.  
<P>

81	This is further confirmed by the terms quoted earlier from the partnership
dissolution deed and the Riverpine deed, dealing with
the winding up of
Riverpine and the distribution of its assets:  these terms seem to me to point
strongly against Riverpine having
an ongoing debt of over $600,000.00 to KPUT,
balanced by debts owing to it by the partners or their companies.  
<P>

82	On the question of transfer of units, "in full satisfaction" means in full
payment of all entitlements as unit holder.  Provided
the deed is regarded as
applying to the accounts as altered by Mr. Napier, this would be fair, having
regard to the acceptance by
all parties that all the downstairs units remaining
in the trust were beneficially owned by the Lee interests, so that in effect
all assets of KPUT were accounted for.  This was also consistent with the
manifest intention of the three deeds to achieve so far
as possible a complete
parting of the ways of the two camps.  
<P>

83	The circumstance that the Milledge, Napier and Kapeleris companies had
received full payment of all their entitlements as unit
holders meant, in terms
of the original KPUT deed, those unit holders had nothing due to them; and this
would be inconsistent with
them being unit holders of any percentage.  It would
mean that they would have no rights as unit holders.  To give effect to this
intention and consequence of the KPUT deed of October 1995, the Court could
mould an appropriate order, that those unit holders either
surrender or
transfer their units.  
<P>

84	On the matter of delay, laches and readiness, willingness and ability, in my
opinion, a defence of lack of readiness, willingness
and ability is available
to the defendants without amendment.  The Statement of Claim is defective in
not pleading readiness, willingness
and ability.  In those circumstances, in my
opinion, the absence of denial of readiness, willingness and ability in the
Defence should
not preclude it being raised by the defendants, particularly
where the matter was debated during the hearing of the case, and no
objection
was taken by the plaintiffs on the basis of surprise.  
<P>

85	These matters must be approached, having regard to the circumstance that the
Milledge, Napier and Kapeleris interests have taken
a substantial benefit under
the deed by reason of the entry into and completion of the contract, and are
not offering to give up
any such benefit.  There was long delay in entering
into and completing the contract; but this is not shown to be solely the fault
of the Lee interests, and in the circumstances is insufficient to defeat
specific performance.
<P>

86	In my opinion, the only possible deficiency in the plaintiffs' case on this
aspect arises from the failure of Mr. Lee to prepare
proper accounts for KPUT
on the basis on which the deed operates, that is on the basis that the Napier
version is substantially correct.
 This failure may be considered all the more
serious because Mr. Lee had undertaken to do this in his letter of 26th
November 1997.
 However, during the hearing the Lee interests made it clear
that they were in substance prepared to have the matter go forward on
the basis
of the Napier version of the accounts, and in my opinion, the plaintiffs have
now demonstrated substantial readiness, willingness
and ability to perform
their side of the bargain.  In circumstances where the defendants have received
and retained benefits, in
my opinion this is sufficient.
<P>

87	As regards the plaintiffs' claim for damages, in my opinion the relevant
defendants were obliged by Covenant 3.1(a) to continue
payments to Citibank of
the appropriate shares of the mortgage instalments between the time of the
contract and completion.  It was
put that these amounts were paid out of income
otherwise available to the trust, and thus not paid by the Lee interests.
However,
in my opinion, the other income of the trust out of which the payments
were made was income from the ground floor units to which
the Lee interests
were entitled in equity, and accordingly cannot to any extent be regarded as
payments made on behalf of any of
the defendants.  In my opinion, the companies
associated with Messrs. Milledge, Napier and Kapeleris are bound to reimburse
the Lee
interests with sums of approximately $1,035.00 per month, being the
instalments attributable to the interest in lot 10 of each of
those entities.
I do not think it is to the point that a small part of those instalments was in
respect of capital.  In addition,
there will be liability for interest at
schedule rates.  
<P>

88	However, in my opinion all other claims for damages by the plaintiffs fail.

<P>

89	As regards the instalments in respect of unit 2, the deed makes no provision
for any liability in the Napier interests to continue
those payments.  I do not
think the previous practice is sufficient to imply such a liability.  
<P>

90	As regards money payable by KPUT to Citibank to get the discharge of
mortgage (bank fee, valuation fee, legal costs of the discharge
of mortgage),
and the trustee's own legal costs, again the KPUT deed imposes no obligation.
It could be argued that those amounts
were, under the KPUT deed, to come out of
the purchase price for unit 11 prior to the ascertainment of the balance to be
distributed
to the interests associated with Messrs. Milledge, Napier and
Kapeleris; but that approach is inconsistent I think with cls.23-26
of the
contract; and in that respect, in my opinion the contract would prevail over
the deed.  
<P>

91	As regards additional expenses incurred by Mr. Lee in relation to his
divorce settlement, in my opinion they are plainly too
remote.  
<P>

	<b><u>RECTIFICATION</u></b>
<P>

92	This question does not actually need to be determined, having regard to my
interpretation of the KPUT deed.  However, I will
briefly deal with it.  
<P>

	<b><u>Submissions</u></b>
<P>

93	Mr. Smallbone submitted that Mr. Nemes' evidence of discussion about the
Milledge, Napier and Kapeleris interests exiting from
the trust, and the
redemption of their units, should be accepted over Mr. Carroll's denials of
such discussion.  Mr. Nemes was supported
by his contemporary notes.  Mr.
Carroll's recollection was not good, and he was unable to give any reasonable
explanation of Covenant
4.2(b).  
<P>

94	Mr. Darvall submitted that rectification required clear and satisfactory
evidence:  <u>Australian Gypsum v. Hume Steel</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1930/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1930] HCA 38</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281930%29%2045%20CLR%2054" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1930) 45 CLR 54</a> at 64;
<u>Moses v. Northern Assurance</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281856%29%201%20VLT%20114" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1856) 1 VLT 114.</a>  There was not such
evidence in this case.
<P>

	<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

95	In my opinion, Mr. Nemes' notes do make it probable that the exiting from
the trust and the redemption of units was discussed;
and to that extent, I
prefer Mr. Nemes' evidence to that of Mr. Carroll.  In general terms, this
tends to confirm my understanding
of what was intended by the deed, although of
course it is not admissible in evidence for this purpose.  But in my opinion,
this
does not amount to clear and satisfactory evidence of an agreement or
common intention sufficient to justify rectification, if my
interpretation of
the deed were incorrect.  
<P>

	<b><u>AMENDMENT</u></b>
<P>

96	Mr. Darvall submitted that the granting of the amendment sought and the
hearing of further evidence was crucial to determination
of the plaintiffs'
claim for specific performance, particularly on the aspect of readiness,
willingness and ability.  
<P>

97	However, without needing to consider whether or not there was an earlier
agreement by Mr. Lee to the amendments to the accounts
effected by Mr. Napier,
I have found that the entry into the KPUT deed manifested an intention by Mr.
Lee and interests associated
with him that the Napier version of the accounts
be adopted, at least for the purpose of giving effect to the deed.
Furthermore,
without amendment I permitted reliance on the defence that the
plaintiffs were not ready, willing and able to perform the deed for
their part.
For those reasons, I do not think the amendment is necessary in order to give
effect to any case reasonably sought to
be raised by the defendants, and in the
light of the lateness of the application and the expense and inconvenience that
would be
involved in re-opening the matter, I refuse the application.
<P>

	<b><u>CONSENT ORDERS</u></b>
<P>

98	Having regard to my decision that the KPUT deed is still in force, it is not
necessary for me to decide the application to set
aside the consent orders.
However, I will briefly deal with it.
<P>

	<b><u>Submissions</u></b>
<P>

99	Mr. Darvall submitted that the orders were interlocutory:  see <u>Sanofi v.
Parke Davis No.11</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20149%20CLR%20147" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 149 CLR 147</a> at 152.  Such orders may be set aside,
even when made by consent and entered:  <u>Mullins v. Howell</u> (1879) 11
Ch.D. 736; <u>Ainsworth v. Wilding</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281896%29%201%20Ch%20673" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1896) 1 Ch. 673.</a>  The Court retains
control of its proceedings, and for that purpose may set aside such orders:

Products</u> (1988) 80 ALR 134.
<P>

100	Mr. Smallbone submitted that consent orders can only be set aside on a
ground on which a contract could be set aside:  <u>Bailey v. Marinoff</u>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1971/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1971] HCA 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%20125%20CLR%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) 125 CLR 529</a>; <u>Nicholson v.

Laval Australia v. Shoalhaven Dairy Co-Op</u>, Giles, J., 12th May 1989.  In
this case, there was no mutual mistake:  <u>McCrae v. Commonwealth Disposals

setting aside a contract, because it was not shown that the plaintiffs knew of
any
such mistake:  <u>Taylor v.

was not properly proved:  <u>Grundell v. Registrar-General</u> (1990) 5 BPR
97340; <u>Dimura v. Public Trustee</u>, Bryson, J., 15th July 1996; <u>Atsas v.

<P>

	<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

101	If the orders in question are properly regarded as final orders, I would be
inclined to accept Mr. Smallbone's submissions.
 However, in this case because
of the close interdependence of the consent orders which were made, with the
issues which were left
to be contested, I do not think the consent orders can
fairly be regarded as orders finally disposing of any aspect of the claim
for
relief.  I think therefore that they are more appropriately regarded as
interlocutory orders; and as such, by reason of what
I believe to be a mistake
by the defendants as to their effect, I would have been inclined to set them
aside, had this been necessary.
 
<P>

	<b><u>MR. KAPELERIS' CLAIM</u></b>
<P>

<b>	<u>Submissions</u></b>
<P>

102	Mr. Zammit referred to Mr. Kapeleris' evidence of the following
conversation between Messrs. Kapeleris and Lee in about July
1986:  Kapeleris:
"I will sell you my entitlement for $92,000.00".  Lee:  "Do you realise that
you may have to pay capital gains
tax on the profit?"  Kapeleris:  "If I have
to I will pay it when the time comes but there is a good chance I will not have
to pay
any capital gains tax as the land was acquired before capital gains tax
was introduced".  Lee:  "I will tell you what I will give
you, $50,000.00 now
being the after-tax amount and later if it is confirmed that no capital gains
tax is payable I will give you
an additional $42,592.00 being the capital gains
tax figure.  That is my best offer".  Kapeleris:  "I will go along with that".
Mr.
Zammit submitted that this evidence was to be preferred to Mr. Lee's denial
of any such conversation.  It was corroborated by Mr.
Tan.  It was in
accordance with the probabilities:  the prices attributed to individual units
in the contract subsequently executed
were much more than $50,000.00, the
valuations of the units were much more than $50,000.00, and the amounts
attributed to the units
in Exhibit L5 were much more than $50,000.00.  
<P>

103	Furthermore, the agreement was plausible.  Capital gains tax, if
applicable, would be levied on a subsequent sale by KPUT for
the benefit of a
unit holder; and once Mr. Kapeleris' entitlement was purchased by Mr. Lee, that
capital gains tax would be payable
by Mr. Lee.  In the absence of Mr. Lee being
liable for such capital gains tax, it was reasonable that he should pay that
amount
to Mr. Kapeleris.  
<P>

104	Specific performance of such an agreement was available to a vendor, even
if all that remained to be done was payment of the
purchase price:  <u>Turner
v. Bladin</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1951/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1951] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281951%29%2082%20CLR%20463" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1951) 82 CLR 463.</a>  Although there was no memorandum, there was
sufficient part-performance:  <u>McBride v. Sandline</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1918/32.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1918] HCA 32</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281918%29%2025%20CLR%2069" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1918) 25 CLR 69</a>;
<u>J.C. Williamson v. Lukey</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1931/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1931] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281931%29%2045%20CLR%20282" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1931) 45 CLR 282.</a>  Accordingly, Mr. Kapeleris'
claim was not statute-barred.  In any event, Mr. Lee was seeking specific
performance which in effect,
in that it would give him full control and rights
in respect of the downstairs unit, involved specific performance of his
agreement
in 1986 with Mr. Kapeleris; and accordingly, he would be required to
complete his agreement with Mr. Kapeleris.  
<P>

105	Mr. Smallbone submitted that the claim was for debt, not specific
performance; and that in any event, a limitation period would
be applied by
analogy:  <u>Firth v. Slingsby</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281888%29%2058%20LT%20481" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1888) 58 LT 481</a>; <u>R. v.

capital gains tax was not payable at the latest in May 1988, and so his claim
was statute-barred.
 
<P>

106	His claim was also defeated by s.54A of the Conveyancing Act; and
part-performance could not be relied on, as it had not been
pleaded.
Furthermore, Covenant 4.2(b) of the KPUT deed discharged any claim of Mr.
Kapeleris.  
<P>

107	In any event, the probabilities were strongly against the existence of any
such agreement.  It was inherently unlikely that
an odd figure such as
$92,000.00 was initially requested, and that in response Mr. Lee specified
$42,592.00.  Those figures were
arrived at by mathematical calculations working
back from a net figure of $50,000.00.  In any event, it did not make sense that
Mr.
Lee would pay Mr. Kapeleris an additional amount because Mr. Kapeleris was
not liable for capital gains tax.  The figures did not
make mathematical sense,
and Mr. Kapeleris was discredited by his claim to have said "Why would I sell
my equity in downstairs for
less than I paid", when it was clear that he had
paid around $17,000.00 for this equity.  
<P>

	<b><u>Decision</u></b>
<P>

108	Looking first at some objective facts, it is plain that $50,000.00 was
never intended to represent 16% of the full value of
downstairs; what it was
intended to represent, if anything, was 16% of the <i>difference</i> between
the value of downstairs and the amount of the mortgage that was to be
attributed to downstairs.  Accordingly, the figures
in the contracts, and the
valuations of the units, are not appropriate figures to compare with
$50,000.00:  what would be appropriate
would be the difference between the
value of the units and the amount of the mortgage attributed to those units.

<P>

109	Next, in my opinion it is clear that the adjustments made between Messrs.
Lee, Milledge and Napier were based in the first instance
on attributing
$50,000.00 as a reasonable sum for 16%; though subsequently this was rounded
off to figures of about one-eighth higher,
which would attribute $56,000.00 or
thereabouts to 16%.  On completion of the building and realisation of some of
the units, it turned
out that 16% was worth something like $80,000.00 or more.
On the other hand, Mr. Kapeleris received his $50,000.00 somewhat earlier,
and
avoided any risks associated with the enterprise.  
<P>

110	On the question of how capital gains tax would relevantly have applied, I
think the relevant application would have been to
a sale of units by KPUT, in
which case capital gains tax, if applicable, would have been payable on the
difference between the acquisition
cost by KPUT (CPI adjusted) and the sale
price.  Applying this to Mr. Kapeleris' share, this would be the difference
attributable
to a sale of 16% of downstairs.  If there was at the time of the
sale from Kapeleris to Lee a difference between the value of Mr.
Kapeleris'
16%, and KPUT's acquisition costs of this 16%, of $92,000.00 or thereabouts,
then $42,000.00 or thereabouts of tax subsequently
payable on the sale of that
16% by KPUT would be attributable to capital gains up to the time of the sale
of Mr. Kapeleris' interest
to Mr. Lee.  It would make some sense then that Mr.
Lee would pay Mr. Kapeleris $50,000.00, on the basis that there would be a
further
$42,000.00 if capital gains tax did not apply.  
<P>

111	However, the conversation given in evidence by Mr. Kapeleris did not refer
to capital gains tax possibly payable in the future
by Mr. Lee, but capital
gains tax possibly payable by Mr. Kapeleris.  As submitted by Mr. Smallbone, I
do not think that does make
sense.  As regards Mr. Tan's corroboration, on the
only occasion when Mr. Tan gave his recollection of the conversation without
being
led, he gave the conversation as being Lee saying to the effect "I will
pay you $50,000.00, and should there be any capital gains
tax I will look after
that", which is entirely different from Mr. Kapeleris' claim.  
<P>

112	I think there is force also in Mr. Smallbone's submission that the original
specification of $92,000.00 by Mr. Kapeleris seems
inherently unlikely.  I have
reservations about Mr. Lee's credibility, having regard to what appears to be
prevaricating conduct
in relation to the Napier version of the KPUT accounts;
but I also have reservations about Mr. Kapeleris' credibility, having regard
to
his unsatisfactory explanation of his statement about being paid less for his
interest than he had paid for it.  
<P>

113	On the whole, I do not think Mr. Kapeleris has discharged the onus which
lies squarely on him of satisfying me that there was
a contract in sufficiently
certain terms about the payment of additional money, or as to what the precise
terms of such a contract
were.  
<P>

114	I am inclined to think, had I found a contract, that the other defences
would have failed.  Having regard to the purely equitable
basis of Mr. Lee's
claim to the remaining six units downstairs, and having regard to the
circumstance that specific performance of
the KPUT deed would in substance
translate that equitable entitlement into a full legal entitlement, I think it
is fair to say that
in substance Mr. Lee is now seeking specific performance of
his 1986 agreement with Mr. Kapeleris.  In those circumstances, I think
Mr. Lee
would be required to honour in full all aspects of his agreement with Mr.
Kapeleris.
<P>

	<b><u>CONCLUSION</u></b>
<P>

115	In the result, I think the plaintiffs are entitled to an order for specific
performance, but in terms which make it clear that
this is to be on the basis
of accounts substantially as prepared by Mr. Napier.  As part of that specific
performance, appropriate
orders would be made which ensure that, one way or
another, the Milledge, Napier and Kapeleris interests cease to be unit holders
in the Kitchener Parade unit trust.  The terms of the specific performance
would be such as to give effect to Mr. Kapeleris' claims,
other than the claim
for $42,592.00.  That lastmentioned claim will be dismissed.  
<P>

116	On the question of costs, I may need to hear submissions, but I will
express some tentative views.  The plaintiffs did not plead
readiness,
willingness and ability, and did not initially give evidence of readiness,
willingness and ability.  Between November
1997 and well into the hearing of
the case, the plaintiffs did not offer performance on their part on the proper
basis.  The defendants'
contentions about the KPUT accounts, particularly
concerning Riverpine, were contested by the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs
lost.
 On the other hand, the overall result of the case must be considered as
substantially a win for the plaintiffs.
<P>

117	The issues raised by Mr. Kapeleris took some time, and Mr. Kapeleris lost
those issues.  However, he did not raise the issue,
which was raised and lost
by Messrs. Milledge and Napier, about the contract not being in performance of
the KPUT deed.  Taking all
these matters into account, my tentative view is
that an order should be made that all of the defendants, apart from the first
defendants
(the trustees), should be ordered to pay one-half of the plaintiffs'
costs.
