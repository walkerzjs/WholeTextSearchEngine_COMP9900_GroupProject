<P>

 
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR: There are presently before the Court several
sets of related proceedings being heard together concerning dealings
between
the parties relating to extensive land holdings at Helensburgh in New South
Wales.  Those dealings led to the creation of
a joint venture relationship
under a written heads of agreement document executed between 11 November and 1
December, 1993 pursuant
to which an agreement called the 'Helensburgh Unit
Trust Holders Agreement', dated 6 April, 1994 was entered into.  Central to the
disputes between the parties at a factual level are the circumstances in which
attempts were made to secure the rezoning of the Helensburgh
lands so as to
allow a substantial portion thereof to be developed as a residential
subdivision.  A principal claim to relief pursued
by the plaintiffs arises by
reason of the failure to secure the rezoning of the subject land. The summons
and other pleadings identify
a number of other claims to relief and defences to
those claims.
<P>

2   	It is not presently appropriate to outline the particular
issues raised by the pleadings save to recognise that the plaintiffs
rely upon
a number of causes of action extending to cover rectification claims, to
implied terms, a representational case, fiduciary
obligations, and breaches of
statutory duty.
<P>

3   	It is also appropriate to recognise, as is not
controversial, that there have been filed and/or are sought to be relied upon
by the respective parties, a large number of complex statements. In the case of
Mr Hogarth, who is the principal lay witness sought
to be called on behalf of
the plaintiffs, his first statement of late December 1998 runs for one hundred
and sixty-one paragraphs
over one hundred pages.  In some cases conversations
which Mr Hogarth gives evidence of in that statement, run to many many pages;
in each instance and in the first person.
<P>

4   	The application presently before the Court is an
application by the defendants recorded at transcript page 269 point 15 as:
<i>"An application to allow further cross-examination of Mr Hogarth by either
of Mr Officer QC or Mr Powell of Counsel on areas and materials
previously not
covered by the cross-examination of Mr Shand".</i>
<P>

5   	That application has been clarified to the extent that it
is not proposed that both of Mr Officer QC and Mr Powell be entitled
to
continue the cross-examination.  The application is for only one of Mr Officer
QC or Mr Powell to be permitted to continue the
cross-examination.
<P>

6   	The application has been brought forward informally by
agreement with the bases of the application at a factual level being
stated
from the bar table, and subject to qualification on some interrogation by Mr
Ellicott of Senior Council for the plaintiffs,
has been accepted as to the
facts which are not in contention.
<P>

7   	Essentially the matters of fact which the defendant relies
upon in relation to the application are these: Firstly, as from
22 October 1999
or shortly thereafter, Mr Shand will be unavailable to appear in this or any
other case for medical reasons and will
be so unavailable until the end of
1999.  That matter is accepted by Mr Ellicott as a given for the purposes of
the contested application.
<P>

8   	The second of the matters of fact stated by Mr Powell from
the Bar table is that prior to the commencement of the hearing on
21 September
1999 (not 20 September 1999 - 20 September having originally been the date
fixed for commencement of the hearing but
that date having been vacated in
circumstances to be later referred to in the judgment), the defendants'
solicitors were aware that
Mr Shand would not be available after 22 October
1999 for those medical reasons.
<P>

9   	In relation to that stated matter of fact Mr Ellicott
enquired as to when Mr Shand was briefed, to be informed that Mr Shand
was
briefed on 11 August 1999, and Mr Ellicott enquired whether or not at the time
when Mr Shand was briefed it was appropriate for
the Court to accept that he
then informed his instructing solicitors that he would not be available on and
after 22 October 1999.
 At transcript page 274.26-31 Mr Shand accepted that
that was the case.
<P>

10   	The third fact stated by Mr Powell from the Bar table was
that prior to the commencement of the hearing on 21 September 1999,
Mr Shand
was of the view that his cross-examination of Mr Hogarth would be lengthy and,
secondly, that the cross-examination would
easily be concluded in the period
between commencement of the hearing and 22 October 1999.
<P>

11   	In that regard Mr Ellicott interrogated at the Bar table
on that proposition.  At transcript page 276.11 Mr Ellicott elicited,
and I
will proceed upon the basis, that insofar as Mr Shand's view that the
cross-examination would easily conclude in the period
20 September to 22
October is concerned, this meant that, and in fact Mr Shand formed that view
based on the proposition that, the
Court would be sitting from the commencement
of the hearing to 22 October without the breaks which the Court has had and
which will
later be referred to in the judgment.  I proceed upon that basis as
an agreed given in the circumstances of the application.
<P>

12   	It is necessary to traverse in some detail the precise
days on which the Court has been sitting following commencement of
the hearing,
the reasons why the Court did not sit on certain days, and the dates when the
parties agreed, or the Court informed
the parties, that the Court would not be
able to sit on those days.
<P>

13   	As I understand it, and save for one or two areas of some
slight uncertainty, I do not understand either party to take exception
with the
following general statement of fact.  I proceed to set out what I understand
generally to be the matrix against which the
application is to be
adjudicated.
<P>

14   	The proceedings were fixed for hearing in February or
March 1999.  They were, the Court has been informed, set down for approximately
six weeks.
<P>

15   	The proceedings were fixed to commence on Monday, 20
September 1999.
<P>

16   	On or about 13 September 1999 Rolfe J, who is the List
Judge, determined that I would be hearing these proceedings.  The parties
were
informed of that fact on about 14 September 1999.
<P>

17   	The matter was in the applications list on 10 September on
an occasion when a question had arisen as to whether or not the
defendants may
wish to make an application, were Rolfe J to have been the trial Judge.  The
parties were informed on that day that
no decision had yet been made as to who
the trial Judge would be.  It eventuated that there never had been any
possibility or concern,
as I understand it, but that Rolfe J could have heard
this case. [although at some stage the defendants appeared to have been
concerned
that Rolfe J may have known Mr Hogarth]  As I presently understand
the position, Rolfe J does not know Mr Hogarth and the Mr Hogarth
whom Rolfe J
had at some stage mentioned he may have known was certainly not the Mr Hogarth
who is the plaintiffs' principal lay
witness.
<P>

18   	As soon as I was notified that I would be hearing the
proceedings, the parties were informed.  I understand from Mr Powell
that the
parties were so informed on about 14 September.  It is likely that on 14
September or thereabouts I would have made plain
to the parties what my usual
pre-trial directions are and, to the best of my recollection, that procedure
was followed in this case.
<P>

19   	Mr Powell has informed the Court that to the best of his
recollection it was the Thursday, 16 September 1999, that I informed
the
parties that the proceedings would not be able to start on the 20th but would,
in fact, begin on the 21st.  I do not understand
that to be an issue between
the parties. I was unable to commence the hearing on the 20th for reasons
unassociated with the parties,
and the hearing began on the 21st.
<P>

20   	I will interrupt the giving of this interlocutory judgment
by pointing out that in the course of giving the judgment, Mr Ellicott
has
handed me a copy of his instructing solicitors' note of the events of 13
September, which note makes plain that it was on that
day, that Monday, that I
informed the parties that I was to be the trial Judge and that the proceedings
would commence on the Tuesday,
and I informed the parties then that the
proceedings would be heard until they finished and made plain that the Court
would not sit
during the week of 4 October.  Those then are the precise facts
which I accept, there being this file note of Mr Ellicott's instructing
solicitor.
<P>

21   	On the same day, that is to say 13 September, this file
note records that I informed the parties that I expected that on 8
October
Hunter J would resume the Construction List, but indicated that I would quite
likely not be able to hear the proceedings
on two Fridays, namely 24 September
and 1 October.
<P>

22   	In the event, as the parties are aware, I was unable to
give the parties any hearing time on either 24 September or 1 October,
being
otherwise on those days engaged in hearing Building and Construction List
matters, or Commercial List matters, in the respective
applications' lists.
<P>

23   	The Court did not sit during the week of 4 October and the
cross-examination by Mr Shand of Mr Hogarth commenced on  Monday,
11 October.
It continued on Tuesday, 12 October, from 12.16pm; on Wednesday, 13 October;
and on Friday, 15 October, from 11.40am.
 It proceeded on Tuesday of this week,
19 October, and has proceeded this morning, Wednesday, 20 October.
<P>

24   	The parties had originally contemplated a view taking
place, which was to have taken place on 11 October, but for a reason
associated
with the unavailability of an expert wishing to participate on the view, the
date for fixing the view was changed from
11 October to 14 October, and the
whole of that day was taken with a view.
<P>

25   	When the proceedings on Friday, 15 October, commenced,
which was at about 11.40am, Mr Shand announced that he could not participate
in
the case beyond the end of this current week, and that substitute Queen's
Counsel had agreed to take over his role.  He indicated
that Mr Officer QC
would become leading counsel for the defendants and that Mr Shand would not be
able to finish his cross-examination
by the end of this current week and,
subject to there being no retracing of cross-examination steps taken by Mr
Shand, indicated
that Mr Officer, subject to the leave of the Court, would seek
to complete the cross-examination of Mr Hogarth.
<P>

26   	It is then necessary to also recognise that there were, in
fact, had the Court sat every day between 20 September and 22 October,
not
including Monday, 4 October (which was a public holiday), some twenty-four
days.  The defendants have pointed out that the non
sitting days since then
have been ten days; namely, 20 September, that is the day when the proceedings
were first due to commence;
24 September and 1 October, when the Court was
engaged in applications in the Construction List and Commercial List; 4 to 8
October,
already referred to; 14 October, the visit to Helensburgh; and 18
October, which is the Monday of this last week.
<P>

27   	In relation to the 18 October situation, what occurred was
that the day was anticipated by the Court to be a continuance of
the
cross-examination.  As the transcript records, at the joint request of senior
counsel for both parties the Court stayed off the
Bench on Monday, 18 October,
and recommenced the hearing on the morning of Tuesday, 19 October, on the joint
application of the parties.
<P>

28   	The openings and motions have taken some seven days;
namely, the plaintiffs' opening 21, 22, 23 and part of 27 September;
the
defendants' opening part of 27 September and 28, 29 and part of 30 September;
and motions to set aside subpoenas being heard
during the balance of 30
September.
<P>

29   	The application to permit cross-examination by an
additional counsel of Mr Hogarth in fact commenced during the morning of
19
October.  At that point in time it was correct to say that Mr Hogarth's
cross-examination had taken some three days and approximately
36 minutes, those
days being Monday, 11 October; Tuesday, 12 October, from 12.16pm; Wednesday, 13
October; and Friday, 15 October,
from 11.40am.  It is further accurate to say
that by the end of this week, when Mr Shand leaves this case, Mr Hogarth's
cross-examination
will have taken approximately six days.
<P>

30   	The further matter of fact which requires to be recognised
is that Mr Shand has been, as announced sometime ago, unavailable
to
cross-examine on Wednesday, Thursday and  Friday afternoon of this week.  That
unavailability is announced to the Court as occurring
by reason of a personal
matter, a non professional matter, and as a personal obligation related to
another person's health.  The
defendants have, through Mr Powell, stated that
this could not have been known to the defendants until recently.
<P>

31   	In relation to when Mr Shand first announced that he would
be unavailable on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday afternoon of this
week, to the
best of my recollection I was informed of that fact privately with Mr Ellicott
some little time ago.  I cannot be precise
on what day.  On whatever occasion,
I simply indicated that I would do whatever counsel jointly agreed and
determine any application
which may be made where there was disagreement.  I
accept what Mr Ellicott's recollection seems to be that it was probably last
week
that this matter was first raised in court by Mr Shand.
<P>

32   	In those circumstances the plaintiffs oppose the
application for leave to be granted for further cross-examination of Mr
Hogarth.
<P>

33   	In support of the application, Mr Powell submits that
there are special circumstances and these circumstances are put in this
fashion:  The first is submitted to be Mr Shand's unavailability for medical
reasons.  In short, Mr Powell submits that there is
a distinction to be made
between unavailability for this reason or unavailability by reason of a counsel
having an inconsistent commitment
by way of another court case, for example, or
another brief.
<P>

34   	The second of the suggested special circumstances relies
upon the amount of evidence which Mr Hogarth traverses in his statement,
in
statements in reply, and in statements which were only received by the
defendants after the commencement of the hearing.  In that
regard the
defendants draw attention to the fact that notwithstanding the directions with
respect to statements, a statement of 3
October 1999 was received by the
defendants on 5 October 1999, this being a statement said to be in reply by Mr
Hogarth and covering
some 103 pages. The defendants also rely upon a further
statement filed in court on 11 October, which is a shorter statement by Mr
Hogarth seeking to make certain amendments to his statement in reply.
<P>

35   	The third suggested special circumstance is that, given
the issues and complexities of the case, the evidence that Mr Hogarth
has
given, and the cross-examination when concluded by Mr Shand, the
cross-examination of Mr Officer, if it is permitted, it is submitted,
could not
be said to have been or be oppressive to Mr Hogarth.
<P>

36   	The final matter relied upon by the defendants is that in
the circumstances outlined in terms of the date history of the proceedings
"it
was reasonable for the legal advisers of the defendants to believe that the
cross-examination of Mr Hogarth would be concluded
in the period 20 September
to 22 October 1999". [Transcript page 273]
<P>

37   	Mr Powell, in submission, has drawn the Court's attention
to the decision of Young J in<b> </b><i>GPI Leisure v Herdsman Investments (No
3)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2020%20NSWLR%2015" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 20 NSWLR 15</a>, in particular to a passage at page 24, where his
Honour said:
<P>

<i>"I am quite sure that there is no hard and fast rule of law  or practice
which compels me to say that only Mr Hughes QC, as the senior
of the two
counsel, can cross-examine any particular witness.  This is because first, I do
not think there is such a rule other than
a guide to how a judge should
exercise his or her discretion, but also I do not think that strictly speaking
the present parties
can be said to be in identical interests as if they were
joint defendants.</i>
<P>

	 
<P>

<i>In all the circumstances my view is that a fair trial will be assured in
accordance with the ruling that I have made, that Mr Hughes
and Mr Archibald
may agree between themselves who will go first in cross-examination, both may
cross-examine, but there is to be
no material overlapping in the
cross-examination of the senior counsel."</i>
<P>

38   	Mr Powell submits, and I accept, that the question is one
for exercise by the Court of its discretion and that the Court exercises
its
discretion in determining how to ensure that a fair trial will be assured.  Mr
Powell, as I understood it, in his submissions
accepted that there are
circumstances in which cross-examination by more than one counsel can clearly
be regarded as oppressive.
<P>

39   	Mr Ellicott accepts that the principle is clear; namely,
that the Court's function is to administer justice between the parties
and in
carrying out that function to be fair.  Mr Ellicott submits that for this
reason the Court has, by and large, and subject
to special circumstances and
exceptional circumstances, generally turned its face against allowing more than
one counsel to cross-examine
a particular witness.  Mr Ellicott submits that
those who wish to have the Court exercise a discretion to permit more than one
cross-examination,
must show that special circumstances exist.
<P>

40   	Mr Ellicott submits that the defendants knew of the
limitations on Mr Shand's time and availability to continue this case
and
refrained from announcing that matter to the plaintiffs or to the Court until
last Friday.  That does seem to be a given circumstance,
no doubt on my
understanding of the matrix of fact.
<P>

41   	Mr Ellicott submits that with their chosen counsel, the
defendants have then pursued the cross-examination in the manner that
they saw
fit, and have used up generally the time available.  That is to say Mr Shand's
available time.  Mr Ellicott submits that
the defendants could have informed
the Court and the plaintiffs of this difficulty, and that for example it may
have then been the
case that no view would have taken place on the day when the
view did take place.  The submission is that the problem which has now
emerged
must have been obvious, and must have been obvious for sometime.
<P>

42   	Mr Ellicott submits that this is not a case of a counsel
falling ill. Mr Ellicott submits that the Court cannot take into
account the
personal circumstances which the defendants assert require Mr Shand to be
absent from the court on Wednesday afternoon,
Thursday afternoon and Friday
afternoon of this week.  That being, on Mr Ellicott's submission, not a
material matter.
<P>

43   	Mr Ellicott draws the Court's attention to a number of
authorities, and in particular in relation to one type of special circumstances
the decision of Beach J in<b> </b><i>Eva Pty Limited v Charles Davis
Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1982/52.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] VicRp 52</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20VR%20515" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) VR 515</a> where Beach J held that there were shown to be
special circumstances to permit departure from the established practice. In
that case
such special circumstances accepted by the Court were that the
magnitude and complexity of the matters to be investigated in the
various
actions made it highly improbable that one counsel could so familiarise himself
with every aspect of the issues to be investigated
so as to be able to
adequately prepare and conduct the cross-examination of the principal witness
in relation to those matters. 
His Honour also took into account the fact that
the matters sought to be dealt with by senior counsel were clearly defined, and
did
not overlap the other issues in the actions which would result in no
duplication of cross-examination provided that junior counsel
proposed to
follow senior counsel confined himself to those special issues.
<P>

44   	Mr Ellicott draws attention to the fact that when the case
was set down for hearing, the plaintiffs are said to have announced
as their
estimate of hearing time, four weeks, and the defendants six weeks.  Mr
Ellicott submits that on any view there has been
time in a six week case to
have had a six day cross-examination.  His submission is that having regard to
the way in which the cross-examination
has been conducted the Court should hold
that it would be oppressive for Mr Hogarth to be exposed to a further
cross-examination.
 Mr Ellicott further points out that whilst the terms of the
application are to allow further cross-examination on areas and materials
not
previously covered by Mr Shand in his cross-examination, a parameter of the
defendants' application is to permit cross-examination
on credit.  Mr
Ellicott's submission is that it will be impossible for Mr Officer or Mr
Powell, depending on which of those members
of the bar would cross-examine, to
keep out of issues credit.
<P>

45   	Mr Ellicott draws particular attention to portions of the
judgment of Beach J including the following appearing at page 517:
<P>

<i>There is then a reference to the decision of Doe v Roe <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1809/526.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1809] EngR 526</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281809%29%202%20Camp%20280" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1809), 2 Camp. 280</a>;
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=170%20ER%201155" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">170 E.R. 1155</a> and I quote: </i>
<P>

<i>"There was two counsel for the plaintiff - the junior having called the
witness, who seemed disposed to shuffle and prevaricate -
the leader interposed
and was proceeding to examine him.  Counsel on the opposite side contended that
this was irregular and that
although where there were several counsel on the
same side they might arrange among themselves by whom the witnesses should be
examined
yet that when the examination of a witness was begun by one gentleman,
the others had no right to put a question.  They might privately
suggest
questions proper to be put but could not address any directly to the witness.
If this rule were not adhered to, a witness
might be subject to the examination
or cross-examination of as many barristers as were retained for the plaintiff
or defendant. 
Much time would be wasted and great confusion would be
introduced into proceedings at nisi prius.  Ellenborough, Lord C.J.:
`Convenience
certainly requires that the examination of a witness should be
carried on entirely by the gentlemen who begins it and several counsel
clearly
cannot be permitted to put questions to the same witness, one after another, in
the manner apprehended, but, I think the
leading counsel has a right, in his
discretion, to interpose and to take the examination into his own hands - very
unpleasant consequences
might follow if this were not allowed.  If a gentleman,
it being his first appearance in a court of justice, should be much embarrassed
in the course of examining a witness - it would be hard if it were in the power
of the opposite party to prevent his leader from
stepping in to his relief.
And other occasions may be imagined when it may be very important that the
gentleman who conducts the
cause should have the privilege of putting questions
to a witness originally called by a co-adjuter.  In the present state of the
Bar there is no danger of this privilege being abused'."</i>
<P>

<i>The passage in Wigmore, supra, continues:-</i>
<P>

<i>"This rule has been recognised in judicial rulings generally and also in a
few statutes doubtless also in many local rules of court.
 It is, of course,
subject to reasonable exceptions allowable in the trial court's discretion.
Moreover, it ought not to apply to
the examination of another witness nor of
the same witness at another stage or by a separate party in the same stage nor
to any process
but that of putting the questions to the witness".</i>
<P>

46   	Mr Ellicott also draws attention to the reference by Beach
J to<b> </b><i>Phillips v Phillips</i>, to be found at page 518 of the decision
in Eva.  One passage of that judgment I note commencing at page 519, includes
an excerpt
from the judgment of Alan J in<b> </b><i>Phillips v Phillips</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%201%20NSWR%2049" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966) 1 NSWR 49</a><b> </b>where the Court had stated:
<P>

 
<P>

<i>"It is, I think, obvious, and as is made clear in the authorities to which I
have been referred, that there are many reasons why this
should prima facie be
adhered to.  It is true that in the particular case of an emergency, perhaps
through illness or other event
which renders it impracticable or undesirable in
the interests of justice, or, indeed, impossible, in the events which have
happened,
for the same Counsel to continue his examination or cross-examination
that in such a case, the Court would allow any other Counsel,
properly briefed
and appearing in the proceedings, to assume the responsibility of continuing
the particular examination or cross-examination,
even though this be already
commenced and incomplete.  One only has to consider the circumstances of sudden
illness, loss of voice
or other emergency which remove from the party's
representation the Counsel whom he or she had had up to that point.  But it
does
seem to me to require some particular occasion to justify this
situation."</i>
<P>

<i>His Honour then referred again to the case of Doe v Roe, supra, and
continued: </i>
<P>

<i>"It will be seen therefore that this authority does contain suggestions to
some extent in support of both Counsel but it seems to
me that it does support
the proposition that there should be, in a particular case, some special
circumstances sufficient to require
the Court to allow a proceeding, which is a
departure from established practice.  Long-established practices are, I
suppose, not
likely to be departed from, yet, in the interests of overall
justice, may on occasion have to be controlled and made amendable to
the
exigencies of the occasion."</i>
<P>

47   	Without being exhaustive in relation to Mr Ellicott's
submissions, he pointed out importantly, as he submitted, that the defendants
did not inform the plaintiffs or the Court of the problem, or looming problem
with Mr Shand's availability until very late in the
piece.  Also that in his
submission, it was not possible to sever in a fashion which would not be
oppressive to Mr Hogarth, the probable
topics for further cross-examination,
and that in the context of the case, and bearing in mind the mode of
cross-examination, on
Mr Ellicott's submission, the defendants have had
sufficient time to complete their cross-examination.
<P>

48   	Neither counsel took the Court to the precise head of
jurisdiction of the Court in exercising its undoubted discretion to
permit or
disallow further cross-examination. That power may be simply part of the
inherent power of the Court.  There are presently
two particular sections of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> which may well apply.  The first is s 11 (1) of the Act which
provides that the power of a court to control the conduct of a proceeding
is
not affected by the Act, except so far as the Act provides otherwise expressly
or by necessary intent.  The other section is s
26, which provides that the
Court may make such orders as it considers just in relation to the way in which
witnesses are to be questioned,
and the presence and behaviour of any person in
connection with the questioning of witnesses.
<P>

49   	In<b> </b><i>Hadid v Australis Media</i><b>
[</b>unreported Supreme Court of New South Wales, Sperling J, 11 November
1996], his Honour apparently dealt with an example of a situation
where the s
26 power could be utilised in a civil case where a number of parties had the
same interest.  The footnote to Odgers Third
Edition Uniform <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> page
64 states that Sperling J considered that the power in this regard derived from
s 11.
<P>

50   	For obvious reasons it is unnecessary for the Court to go
further into the question of the power of the Court in relation
to exercising a
discretion one way or another.
<P>

51   	To my mind, of some particular importance in relation to
the mode in which the Court's discretion should here be exercised
is the fact
that the litigation is complex, involves very large sums of money, and involves
important claims in relation to the credit
of various material witnesses.
Additionally to be taken into account is  the fact that a second amended
summons was propounded on
21 September, and a third amended summons on 27
September.
<P>

52   	Importantly it seems to me, to be included as part of the
Court's consideration of the subject application, is the matter
of the arrival
of the late statements by Mr Hogarth, and particularly the 3 October one
hundred and three paragraph statement.
<P>

53   	Whilst the Court endeavours to keep a level playing field
by giving directions for the service of statements by particular
dates during a
conventional timetable leading up to a hearing, it is not uncommon for one
party or the other during the hearing to
seek to add to earlier statements,
whether by lay witnesses or by experts.  This experience requires the Court to
adjudicate disputes.
 From time to time no leave to rely upon late statements
is granted, and from time to time leave is granted, and sometimes, subject
to
conditions.  In every circumstance it is my understanding that the Court will
adjudicate applications for amendment of a summons,
or a defence, or a
cross-claim, or a defence to cross-claim, and will adjudicate an application
for leave to rely upon and file and
read a late statement, on an instant
specific basis.  That requires the Court to inquire as to possible prejudice of
the opposing
party, and requires the Court to embark upon a fairly delicate
exercise of, at the same time, permitting each party to have their
full day in
court, and ensuring that there is no grave prejudice to a recipient party in
terms of making any such order.
<P>

54   	I have come to the clear conclusion in the present
circumstances that the application by the defendants for leave to further
cross-examine, subject to constraints, should be allowed.  I take into account
importantly the fact that Mr Powell of junior counsel
for the defendants has
been in court every day during the hearing up to this point in time, and that
it cannot be said that if Mr
Powell is to further cross-examine, such further
cross-examination would be without a very full and detailed understanding of
the
whole of the course of both the addresses, as well as the cross-examination
to this point in time, as well as the particular documents
on which Mr Hogarth
has cross-examined.  For the same reason, if Mr Officer is to conduct the
further cross-examination, I would
not permit that exercise in the absence of
Mr Powell as his junior, for the reason that Mr Powell would know when and if
objections
were taken by Mr Ellicott to a line of cross-examination and
generally, when and how Mr Officer's questions may offend the obviously
important consideration that ground already covered in cross-examination by Mr
Shand, be not recovered.  To my mind the constraints,
the subject of the
application as made, namely to allow further cross-examination by either one of
Mr Powell or Mr Officer QC, and
on areas not previously covered by Mr Shand,
are a sufficient protection to the plaintiffs to avoid oppression in the
circumstances.
When and if cross-examination on areas of credit is sought to be
pursued by whichever counsel is to further cross-examine, the Court
will
entertain, depending as it arises, objections by the plaintiffs, should it
appear that the cross-examination by reason of that
already carried out by Mr
Shand, is oppressive to Mr Hogarth.
<P>

55   	It is certainly the case that the Court's exercise of the
discretion in this case takes very much into account the voluminous
nature of
the statements put on by Mr Hogarth, and the voluminous nature of the materials
now before the Court subject in certain
cases to objections which may or may
not be pursued of Exhibits PX and DX.
<P>

56   	The type of case with which the Court is presently dealing
is beset with enumerable issues of fact, and enumerable sub issues
of fact, and
enumerable issues of credit.  In a real sense, one of the plaintiffs' attempts
in the case is to have the Court determine
as a matter of probability, what are
the prospects that had the Commission of Inquiry into the Helensburgh lands
been conducted in
a particular way the decision may have been otherwise than in
fact the decision was.  That very circumstance ought make plain the
unusual
nature of these proceedings, and the fact that the Court must strain to give
each party, not only in relation to cross-examination,
but in relation to
calling of evidence, address, and generally the procedures which the forensic
entitlements of the parties permit,
a full opportunity to each have their day
in court.  Had Mr Hogarth been a minor witness in the scheme of things, the
decision on
discretion may have been very differently exercised. Mr Hogarth,
together with one or two other of the plaintiffs witnesses, and
together with
two or three possibly of the defendants' witnesses, are the principal, as it
were, lay witnesses who give evidence
in relation to conversations and
negotiations and communications which cover literally a number of years.
<P>

57   	Finally, it is important to note that to my mind the fact
that the defendants have not informed the Court or the plaintiffs
of precisely
what are the areas upon which the new counsel will cross-examine, ought not of
its own result in the application be
dismissed. That having been said, I have
taken account of the general estimate by Mr Powell and/or Mr Shand that it is
likely that
the remaining cross-examination will take approximately two days.
At the end of two days I will entertain a further application,
if it is pursued
by Mr Ellicott, for the Court to then peremptorily, regardless of the then
state of the cross-examination, debar
further cross-examination.  Again, any
such application will be determined on its then merits.  The Court exercising
its discretion
in this fashion should not be read by the defendants as in any
fashion permitting the defendants to traverse the same ground, or
to in effect
to have a second attempt to cross-examine on areas not legitimately said to be
"materials or areas not previously covered
by Mr Shand in his
cross-examination".
<P>

58   	For those reasons, I allow the application in the terms in
which it was made, and grant leave to the defendants to further
cross-examine
Mr Hogarth by either Mr Officer QC or Mr Powell, on areas and materials
previously not covered by the cross-examination
of Mr Shand, but permitting
further cross-examination on credit generally.
