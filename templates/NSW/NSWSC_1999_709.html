<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR : </b>This is an application to review the
decision of the Registrar not to grant probate of an unexecuted document under
s 18A of the Wills
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Act 1898</a> as the last will of
Beryl Patricia Sharman.
<P>

2   	The jurisdiction to make the decision in this type of case
is given to the Registrar and this is one of the few situations
where a review
lies to the court under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/index.html#p61" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 61</a> r 3 of the Supreme Court Rules; vide Pt 78 r
6.
<P>

3   	On such a review, as the authorities set out in the Supreme
Court Practice show, the court does not completely treat it as
a hearing de
novo, especially where the review is from Registrars who are particularly
skilled in this sort of work.  The decision
of the Registrar is usually
something that the applicant must show is affected by error to such an extent
that it should not stand.
 This is not so much a general principle, but a
practical working method of the review process in probate.
<P>

4   	The essential facts are that the testatrix has four
children.  She realised in May 1998 that her will of 1992 needed to be
updated.
Her daughter Colleen Versluis approached Mr Frankland solicitor to draw a new
will.  He did so and sent the draft of the
will to Colleen.  She then discussed
the will with her mother, the testatrix, and the testatrix reacted in a way to
show that she
understood what was in the will, however she wanted some
alterations made.
<P>

5   	Colleen then wrote to the solicitor on the same day and
relayed this information.  On 27 July 1998 the solicitor advised that
some of
the alterations need not be made because the proper interpretation of the will
meant the document stated what the testatrix
wanted it to mean in any event,
but that some of the alterations could be made, and he would make them.
<P>

6   	The solicitor then made some handwritten alterations to the
draft and submitted it to his word processing department, and the
evidence
shows that the document was formally altered at 2.38pm on 27 July.
<P>

7   	Somewhere between 2 and 3pm Colleen spoke to her mother and
the testatrix appeared to be relieved that everything that she
had wanted to
change in the will had been changed.  Colleen said:
<P>

"I observed her to be relieved and content when I told her the terms of her
Will had been finalised ...  and I know that she intended
the altered document
to be her Will without her having to go through the formal steps of having it
signed and witnessed."
<P>

8   	Had it been contested proceedings probably part of that
piece of evidence would have been inadmissible, but the flavour of
it is that
the testatrix rested after knowing that everything was in order.
<P>

9   	The daughter went on to say that:
<P>

"My mother would have known that it was usual to sign a will and have her
signature witnessed."
<P>

10   	She then, however, expresses the opinion, which again
would probably not be admissible in contested proceedings:
<P>

"She would have been horrified if she thought her 1992 Will operated instead of
that prepared by Mr Frankland on her behalf."
<P>

11   	The testatrix died on 10 August 1998 without having
executed her will because of deterioration in her health. She was 75 when
she
died and left an estate of approximately $2.7 million without liabilities.
<P>

12   	The will which was prepared, in the words of the
Registrar:
<P>

"Comprises some 20 pages plus a front sheet.  It is unsigned and undated and
even though in superficial respects it is in a will
format, it is clearly
primarily just a vehicle for the setting up of testamentary trusts for each of
the deceased's four children."
<P>

13   	The learned Registrar considered the decision of the Court
of Appeal in<b> Re Masters</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2033%20NSWLR%20446" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 33 NSWLR 446</a>; the several unreported
decisions of Powell J in<b> Re Kencalo</b> (23 October 1991); <b>Clothier v
Rampling</b> (9 December 1991) and<b> Re McInnes</b> (10 April 1992); the
decision of Cohen J in<b> Re Gray</b> (8 July 1998, unreported) and that of
Windeyer J in<b> Re Pauncz</b> (8 October 1998, unreported).
<P>

14   	He said that the problem involved the third of the
propositions of Powell J in<b> Re Kencalo</b>, namely that:
<P>

"The evidence ...  must be such as to satisfy the Court that  ...  the relevant
deceased, by some act, or words, demonstrated that
it was his, or her, then
intention that the document in question should, without more, operate as his,
or her, will."
<P>

The learned Registrar said:
<P>

"Ultimately however, the question to be decided is whether the Court is
satisfied that the deceased intended the document to constitute
her will and
the authorities show that what has to be considered here is not whether the
deceased had some intention of disposing
of her property in the way set out in
the document, but rather whether or not she intended this document without
anything more happening,
to actually constitute her will.  That is, a document
which she had neither seen, nor read and which was never even delivered to
her
prior to her death.  Thus, to my mind, the third requirement to bring s 18A
into effect was not satisfied.  Merely to say that
(the deceased) 'wished the
document to be her new will' after she had decided on numerous changes to be
made on the first draft,
and <u>before</u> these changes had been communicated
to the solicitor and then incorporated into a subsequent draft, is not
sufficient.  ...  
<P>

The deceased clearly knew the formalities required for execution of a will.
She had made at least one before.  It is proper in the
circumstances to infer
that she was well aware that all that she had done, albeit through an
intermediary, was to give  instructions
from which a formal will would be
prepared and that such a document could not operate as a will unless and until
it was properly
signed.  There is no suggestion that she intended it to operate
before execution."
<P>

15   	Accordingly, the Registrar declared that the court was not
satisfied that the document constituted a will, an amendment to
a will or a
revocation of a will.
<P>

16   	On the review Mrs Gilmour for the plaintiffs put that the
learned Registrar took too narrow a view of s 18A.  She said that
the section
was plainly a remedial section and the authorities show that it is to be
liberally interpreted. She further put that
if anyone had suggested to the
testatrix just before she died that she had not made a will in accordance with
the document last prepared
by Mr Frankland she would have contradicted them
strongly.  She put that it would be a travesty if the document into which so
much
time and care was put, and which contained all the dispositive provisions
that the testatrix wished to see implemented, was not given
effect to.
<P>

17   	The alleged will is in evidence.  The description of it by
the learned Registrar might, with respect, be a bit misleading
in that the
document is of 20 pages, the first three pages are in typical will form and
then there is virtually a schedule of 16
pages setting out the terms and
conditions of a family testamentary trust for each of her four children.  The
earlier parts name
the four children, make specific gifts and then set up the
four trusts to administer the rest and residue of the estate.
<P>

18   	There is no doubt that the reforms made by the
introduction of s 18A into the Act are to be construed liberally.  However,
it
must always be borne in mind what those reforms were designed to achieve.
<P>

19   	In order for a court to grant probate it must be satisfied
that the document propounded is the last will of a free and capable
testator,
which was duly executed with the knowledge and approval of the testator.
<P>

20   	Section 18A only deals with one matter in this formula,
namely due execution.   The rest of the requirements for a valid will
are
unaffected by s 18A, that is, that even if the court did consider that the
document fell within it, the Registrar would still
have to be satisfied that it
was a document of which the testator knew and approved.
<P>

21   	Although it may well be the situation that there is no
problem at all with the members of this particular family, the court
always
looks with great suspicion at a will that is prepared by a solicitor without
direct contact with the testator.  Unless the
solicitor actually sees the
testator there is always great suspicion in respect of the will, especially
when the children are the
beneficiaries.
<P>

22   	It should be the practice of all solicitors to make sure
that they see the testator themselves and make sure that what is
in the will is
understood by the testator and that he freely accedes to it.  They should have
their interview with the testator without
the presence of any of the
beneficiaries, though often this will be impossible for psychological or other
reasons.  When this is
not done, there will almost always be problems with
showing that the will is made with the knowledge and approval of a free and
capable
testator.
<P>

23   	So far as execution is concerned, up until 1 January 1838,
in England, a will of personalty could take any form and need not
even be in
writing.  In the Wills Act of 1837 in England, and local legislation followed
later in the 19th century, formal requirements
were set down for the making of
wills.  These requirements in their current form appear in s 7 of the Wills
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Act 1898</a>.  The Wills Act of 1837 changed the form of
execution. Section 18A merely mitigates against the effect of s 7 by allowing
some liberty.
<P>

24   	It is instructive to look at the cases before 1837 and
also the cases of the wills of soldiers, sailors and mariners which
were exempt
from the 1837 Act, and also exempt from the Act which both in Australia and
England succeeded the 1837 Act.
<P>

25   	One such decision is the decision of the Prerogative Court
in<b> Theakston v Marson</b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1832/169.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1832] Eng R 267</a>; (1832) 4 Hagg Ecc 290;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=162%20ER%201452" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">162 ER 1452.</a>  In that case
a clergyman had written down:
<P>

"Theakston's will Nov 4th.  Theakston wished me to make his will, and bring it
for execution on Tuesday next.  His wife to have
100 pounds a year.  Marson to
be executor and RL with the whole of the property.  Myself trustee to secure
the annuity.  Read this
to him when I took it down.  Appd".
<P>

26   	So there one had a set of circumstances where the evidence
of the clergyman was that these were the terms of the will and
that he was to
have it properly prepared and brought back the next week.  Unfortunately, the
testator died before this could happen.
 The court did not believe the
clergyman, but Sir John Nicholl said that even if he had believed the clergyman
he would not have
granted probate of that particular document because he could
not be satisfied that the document did intend to operate as the testator's
last
will.
<P>

27   	With soldiers, sailors and mariners the same sort of
attitude was taken.   In the Sunnucks edition of  Williams and Mortimer<b>
Executors Administrators and Probate</b> (Stevens &amp; Sons, London, 1970) p
218, the following appears:
<P>

"A letter to solicitors stating how the testator wished his will to be altered
and asking them to destroy his will and make a fresh
one as indicated by his
letter was admitted to probate in an unreported case.  In another unreported
case a draft will as altered
by a soldier and sent to his solicitor by covering
letter and a memorandum was admitted to probate. The court must be satisfied
that
the document in question is intended as a will and is not merely a
draft."
<P>

28   	They referred to the decision of<b> Boughton-Knight v
Wilson</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281915%29%2032%20TLR%20146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1915) 32 TLR 146</a>, but although I have read that decision it does
not really seem to me to be particularly relevant to the present sort of
problem.
<P>

29   	Those unreported cases referred to by Williams and
Mortimer show that one can have a situation where, although a second document
is to be prepared, a person can make a will by sending an amended copy of an
earlier will to a solicitor. But that, however, is a
stronger situation to the
present one, and also the document of which probate was granted was an earlier
draft with additions, not
the solicitor's redraft.
<P>

30   	I mention these authorities before dealing with the
authorities under s 18A itself to meet the criticism of Mrs Gilmour of
counsel
that many of the decisions under s 18A are too restrictive.  It is important, I
think, to see that s 18A only deals with
the matter of execution and not with
other matters of the will, and that the decisions in New South Wales are
consistent with the
line of thinking that has been followed for hundreds of
years on wills to which s 7 did not apply.
<P>

31   	Section 18A requires three matters to be satisfied. That
there is a document is one of those.  The fact that the section centres
on
there being a document is important.  One must get past the stage of there
being an oral communication to a person who is to prepare
a document of the
testator's wishes.  Unless there is a document then one cannot get to the first
base of a s 18A application.  Once
there is that document then one must also
show that it embodies the testamentary intention of the deceased.  Then there
is a third
element to satisfy.
<P>

32   	Mrs Gilmour points to the judgment of Kirby P in
<b>Masters'</b> <b>case</b> and notes that at p 449 his Honour does not use the
words "without more", as Powell J did in<b> Kencalo</b>, but merely says that
the document must constitute "a will of the deceased person".
<P>

33   	His Honour then says that it must be a will in the wider
sense of the word because if the will complied with s 7 there would
be no need
to make the application; see p 451G.  He then goes on to say that one should
not narrow the operation of the intended
reform.  At the very least Kirby P
says that there must be a will in the pre-1837 sense and that the reform is
merely to get over
the strict requirements of the formalities of s 7.
<P>

34   	It is true that in<b> Masters' case </b> and in the later
decision of<b> Pahlow-Silady v Siladi</b> (22 April 1997, unreported) the Court
of Appeal did not mouth the words "without more", but it is also true that the
Court of Appeal
never criticises in any way any of the first instance decisions
that do employ that language.  Indeed, Mason P in the<b> Pahlow-Silady</b> case
at p 8 of BC 9701391 refers to the old cases and says that the document of
which probate is to be granted must be more than
a draft, it must be something
which the deceased intended should constitute his will.
<P>

35   	There are great difficulties, when the testatrix has never
seen the document, in coming to the conclusion that she must have
intended that
that document should operate as her will.  In one of the early decisions on s
18A of the Act<b> Re Brown </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20535" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23 NSWLR 535</a>, Powell J indicated that it
was possible but very, very difficult that such could be the case.  That it
could be so was illustrated
in<b> The Estate of Vauk</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2041%20SASR%20242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 41 SASR 242</a>
where, as  appears on p 245, just before committing suicide there was a note
from the testator, "There will the PU Trustee - changed:
 to be valid!"
<P>

36   	The note had been affected by the fact that it had somehow
or other become cut and come under the testator's body.  Legoe
J held that the
document should be admitted to probate as there was no reasonable doubt that
the document, which the testator had
never seen, drafted by the Public Trustee
was by his note to constitute the will.  That, however, is really a case on
very exceptional
facts.
<P>

37   	Here the testatrix knew that wills had to be executed. She
knew that the solicitor was going to send the will out.  She may
have been
content because she thought all the processes were over, but there is
insufficient material for me to conclude that she
at that stage thought a
document, which may just have been brought into existence at the moment her
daughter was speaking to her,
or may not, the evidence is equivocal, was at
that moment to constitute her will.
<P>

38   	Accordingly, in my view the learned Registrar came to the
correct decision and his decision must be affirmed.
<P>

39   	However, I must record my indebtedness to Mrs Gilmour who
drew my attention to a large number of authorities and made me think
very, very
deeply about the operation of the section and on the facts of this particular
case because these decisions really are
 ultimately questions of fact in each
particular case.
