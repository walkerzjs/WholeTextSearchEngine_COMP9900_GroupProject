<b>JUDGMENT</b> <b>(Admission into evidence of MFI 27, copy "<i>unabridged"</i>
report of Dr Dent dated 18 May 1998; T2702)</b>
<P>

 
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR: At the conclusion of the evidence of Dr Dent
yesterday, there remained outstanding the question of the tender of
MFI 27, the
copy of a report dated 18 May 1998.  It is a report by Dr Dent which, on the
state of the evidence, fairly can be described
as the "<i>unabridged"</i>
report.  What on the state of the evidence can fairly be described as the
"<i>abridged" </i>report is part of exhibit F.
<P>

2   	The document MFI 27 was the subject of much
cross-examination as to its creation, its alteration by omission, its
references
to matters other than the two television programs as stressors and
the like.  Its importance as at 26 November, in terms of relevance,
is set out
in paragraph 15 of my judgment on that date in relation to a claim for
privilege ([1999] NSWSC 1155: DLJT: 59).  The present
state of the evidence
leads fairly easily to the conclusion that the witness disavowed the
"<i>abridged"</i> report of 18 May, being part of exhibit F.  
<P>

3   	The defendant says it would be unfair to admit the MFI as a
medical report which was not served.  It was indicated that it
had not been
made available, as it would be in the usual course, to any expert qualified by
the defendant, in a way that would enable
such an expert to provide comment and
thus lay the groundwork for cross-examination.
<P>

4   	The ambit of the cross-examination of Dr Dent is capable of
indicating various areas under challenge by the defendant.  It
questions
whether any opinion was expressed at all; whether any opinion, if expressed,
was founded on bases that could be described
as true or false by reason of the
alteration of the report; and whether the opinion, if any was expressed, took
into account the
matters I have referred to as "<i>other stressors</i>".
<P>

5   	If the defendant's position is that Dr Dent's overall
report establishes nothing in the context I have just outlined, even
by way of
opinion, I do not see how it is disadvantaged or prejudiced by not having been
provided it to any expert retained by it.
 If it is the defendant's position
that Dr Dent failed properly to give weight to the other stressors conformably
with an opinion
held by an expert qualified for the defendant, as I have
indicated, that appears  to have been dealt with in cross-examination. 

<P>

6   	It is all very well to refer to the energies expended by
the plaintiff some days ago, and yesterday, to keep the report "<i>out".
</i>At the same time there was the expenditure of energies by the defendant to
get it "<i>in"</i>.  The reversal of those positions, in the light of
yesterday's evidence, to the point where MFI 27, that is the
"<i>unabridged"</i> 18 May 1998 report is excluded, would, at the very least,
make a mockery of the quest for truth in litigation of this kind, even
within
the structure of the adversary system.  The unabridged report of 18 May 1998,
being the one presently marked for identification
27, will become exhibit G.
