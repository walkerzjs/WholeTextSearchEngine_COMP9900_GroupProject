<b>MASTER McLAUGHLIN</b>
<P>

<i>Wednesday, 3 November 1999</i>
<P>

<b>5307/97 	SHIRLEY ANNE SHERRY   -v-   CHARLES DAVID ALEXANDER MANASSEH  AND
GLORIA REGINA CNAPICH</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:   </b>These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act </i>1982</a>. 
<P>

2   	By summons filed on 24 December 1997 the plaintiff Shirley
Ann Sherry claims an order for provision for her maintenance and
advancement in
life out of the estate of her late mother Paula Flora Manasseh (to whom I shall
refer as "the deceased"). 
<P>

3   	The deceased died, aged 75, on 11 April 1996. She left a
will dated 19 June 1995, probate whereof was on 11 December 1996 granted
to
Charles David Alexander Manasseh and Gloria Regina Cnapich, the executors named
in such will (who are the defendants to the present
proceedings). 
<P>

4   	By that will the deceased gave her estate (after payment of
debts, funeral and testamentary expenses) in equal shares to her
son and her
two daughters, being the three parties to the present proceedings. 
<P>

5   	The only asset disclosed in the inventory of property of
the deceased was a house property situate at and known as 74 Glenayr
Avenue,
North Bondi, to which an estimated value of $375,000 was ascribed. However,
that property was subsequently sold, and the
assets of the estate now consist
of the net proceeds of that sale, which are held in two investment accounts in
the Commonwealth
Bank, in a total amount of $476,151.90. Each of the parties
will receive one-third of those proceeds, which, after allowance is made
for
the costs of the present proceedings ($22,478 for the plaintiff, $18,370 for
the defendant), will provide to each of them about
$145,000 (or, if ultimately
only the costs of the defendants are payable out of the estate of the deceased,
about $152,600).
<P>

6   	The proceedings were not instituted within eighteen months
of the death of the deceased (as required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act</a></i>). Accordingly, the plaintiff, by prayer 1 in the summons,
seeks an order, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16(2)</a> of the Act, extending the period for
the filing of the summons up to and including the date of the filing of the
summons (that being
24 December 1997). Any such extension of the prescribed
period is opposed by the defendants. 
<P>

7   	The deceased was a widow at the time of her death, her
husband Elias Hai Manasseh (also known as Alec Manasseh) having predeceased
her
on 5 July 1994. The plaintiff and the two defendants are the only children of
the marriage of their parents. 
<P>

8   	The plaintiff was born on 29 May 1949 (and is presently
aged 50). The first defendant (to whom I shall refer as Charles) is
presently
aged 37. The second defendant (to whom I shall refer as Gloria) was born on 30
November 1954 (and is presently aged 44).
The deceased, her husband and their
children originally resided in Singapore. Subsequently the deceased, her
husband and each of
their three children (although at different times)
relocated to Australia, living variously in Sydney and in Perth. 
<P>

9   	The plaintiff married her first husband in 1976, and lived
in California for some time before returning to Singapore. Upon
marrying her
present husband, Lionel Sherry, in February 1980 the plaintiff entered into
occupation of a house property owned by
Lionel, and in which he had to that
time been residing, situate at and known as 50 Murriverie Road, Bondi. The
purchase price, which
apparently had been largely funded by a housing loan
secured by a mortgage, had been largely paid off by Mr Sherry before his
marriage
to the plaintiff. That house property is now unencumbered. After their
marriage Mr Sherry transferred the title in that house property
(which is still
the family home of the plaintiff and her husband) to himself and the plaintiff
as joint tenants. It is estimated
that that house property is now worth
$700,000. 
<P>

10   	Mr Sherry is presently 56 years of age. Although qualified
as a television repairer, Mr Sherry has earned only a small income
from that
occupation in recent years, due essentially to health problems, of both a
physical and an emotional nature.
<P>

11   	As well as his interest in the house property at
Murriverie Road, Mr Sherry's assets consist of a superannuation entitlement
of
$14,000, together with shares in companies worth about $71,700. Mr Sherry (who
is an only child and whose father is deceased)
owes an amount of $25,000 to his
mother, now aged in her 80s.
<P>

12   	The plaintiff and her husband have one child, a son Samuel
(born on 16 July 1983 and presently aged sixteen), who is still
at school and
resides with them.
<P>

13   	Evidence was given by both the plaintiff and her husband
concerning the present condition and the state of deterioration of
the
Murrieverie Road property, and their architect's estimate that an amount of
about $60,000 would be required to remedy essential
problems, and to effect the
conversion to a garage of a disused shop located at the front of the residence.

<P>

14   	The plaintiff is employed as a pay clerk at the Prince of
Wales Hospital. She works on average between 24 and 30 hours a week,
and earns
between $300 and $350 (after tax) per week. The plaintiff also in her spare
time works as an Amway representative. During
the financial year preceding the
hearing the plaintiff earned $1,980 gross from her Amway activities. At the
time of the hearing
she held shares worth about $24,500, from which she
received dividends totalling about $800 a year. The plaintiff has savings of
$1,700, and has an accrued superannuation entitlement of $23,000. 
<P>

15   	The plaintiff's liabilities consist of a personal bank
loan of $1,500 and credit card debts of $2,600.
<P>

16   	A considerable quantity of evidence was devoted to details
of the various residences in which the deceased and, at various
times, each of
her three children lived after each of them came to Australia, and the funding
of the acquisition of each of those
residences. 
<P>

17   	For the purposes of the present proceedings it is not
necessary for me to rehearse that detailed information. Suffice it to
say that
the plaintiff came to Sydney in 1980. Gloria came to Sydney in 1981. The
deceased and Charles came to Sydney in either January
1983 or January 1984.
After residing in Sydney for several years the deceased returned to Singapore
in July 1986 (her husband having
remained in Singapore during that period
whilst the deceased was residing in Sydney). The deceased and her husband then
left Singapore
in late 1990 and relocated in Sydney. Subsequently the deceased,
her husband, Gloria and Gloria's family relocated from Sydney to
Perth in 1991.
The deceased returned to Sydney in August 1993. Charles relocated to Perth in
February 1994, not long after his mother
had suffered a cerebral haemorrhage in
January of that year. The deceased entered a nursing home in Sydney in April
1994. On 5 July
1994 her husband died, in Perth. The following month the
deceased was transferred to a nursing home in Perth, where she resided until
her death some twenty-one months later. 
<P>

18   	The various residential properties in which the deceased
and her children resided, in both Sydney and Perth, were purchased
with moneys
provided by the deceased's husband Alec Manasseh. It was his practice to send
funds from Singapore to Australia for that
purpose. For example, in 1982 Alec
Manasseh funded the purchase, in the plaintiff's name, of a home unit at 4/114
Murrieverie Road,
Bondi. Gloria resided in that home unit from 1983 until April
1985, paying $60 a week rent to the plaintiff. At various times after
her
arrival in Australia the deceased resided with the plaintiff and also with
Gloria. 
<P>

19   	In April 1985 the deceased purchased the residence at 74
Glenayr Avenue (which comprised her only asset at the time of her
death), in
which she commenced to reside with Gloria, Gloria's husband and their two
children. 
<P>

20   	During the period 1984 to 1991 the deceased made a number
of extended visits to Singapore, but Gloria and her family continued
to reside
in the Glenayr Avenue property. During the period after his mother's removal
from 4/114 Murrieverie Road Charles resided
in that home unit for a period of
two years. Despite the plaintiff's assertion that Charles did not pay any rent,
although he paid
the expenses and outgoings on that residential unit, it was
the evidence of Charles that he paid to the plaintiff rent of $60 a week.
In
1986 Faridah Mohamed, who had been employed by the family in Singapore, arrived
in Australia to work as a full-time helper for
Gloria. Both Charles and Miss
Mohamed then moved into residence at 74 Glenayr Avenue. In August 1988 Charles
and Miss Mohamed commenced
to live in a de facto relationship. 
<P>

21   	As well as providing funds for the purchase of 4/114
Murrieverie Road and 74 Glenayr Avenue, Alec Manasseh in 1982 advanced
$60,000
to the plaintiff and her husband for the purpose of constructing extensions to
their residence in order to accommodate the
deceased and Charles. 
<P>

22   	In 1992 Alec Manasseh purchased, in Gloria's name, a house
property at 33 Lantana Crescent, Dianella in Western Australia.
According to
Gloria the purchase price was $165,000, although the plaintiff said that her
father told her that that house had cost
$220,000. Upon its purchase, the
deceased and her husband, Gloria and her family and Charles all moved into
residence in the Dianella
house property. 
<P>

23   	On 7 September 1992 each of the deceased and her husband
made a fresh will. 
<P>

24   	At the same time Alec Manasseh executed a document
referred to as his "First Direction". That document is not in evidence
in the
present proceedings. 
<P>

25   	However, on 14 December 1993 Alec Manasseh executed a
further document (which was entitled "Direction", but was also referred
to in
the proceedings as his "Second Direction"). That document, which had been
prepared by a firm of solicitors, included directions
that certain assets which
he had already transferred to one or other of the defendants should be held by
such defendant for the benefit
of the plaintiff, subject to the expressed
desire that during her lifetime "the income therefrom be utilised for the
benefit of"
the deceased. The legal effect of that document was far from clear,
and certainly was not the subject of any detailed analysis in
the hearing of
the present proceedings.
<P>

26   	However, it clearly emerged that, in consequence of the
existence of that document, there had been a number of discussions
and
negotiations between the plaintiff on the one hand and the defendants on the
other hand during the period of about twenty-one
months between the death of
their father in July 1994 and the death of their mother in April 1996, and for
a further period after
the death of their mother. 
<P>

27   	The attitude of the defendants appears to have been
(indeed, this was expressly stated by at least Gloria, under cross-examination
at the hearing) that whilst their mother was alive the defendants were prepared
to abide by the terms of the direction made by their
father (that is, that the
income from those assets be used for the benefit of the deceased), but that, as
soon as their mother died,
the defendants decided not to carry out the terms of
the direction that assets be held for the benefit of the plaintiff --- whether
or not they were under any legal obligation to do so. That decision was not
communicated to the plaintiff until June 1997.
<P>

28   	That conduct on the part of the defendants has obviously
been one of the precipitating factors which has brought about the
institution
of the present proceedings by the plaintiff. That conduct on the part of the
defendants is certainly not honourable conduct,
and reflects very poorly upon
the characters of the defendants. However, such dishonourable conduct by the
defendants is not of itself
in any way determinative of the present
proceedings. Indeed, I doubt whether it is of significance, or even of
relevance, to the
present claim of the plaintiff brought by her against the
estate, not of her father, but of her mother. There is no evidence to suggest
that the plaintiff in any way acted in reliance upon her expectations under the
direction of 14 December 1993. 
<P>

29   	It is appropriate here to record that the plaintiff sought
and obtained legal advice from Tress, Cox and Maddox, solicitors,
concerning
any rights which she might have against her father's estate. That advice (which
was given by letter dated 22 January 1997)
adverted to the direction of 14
December 1993, and also expressly referred to the limitation period in respect
to any claim under
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. 
<P>

30   	There was an incident at the Sydney Airport in January
1997, when Gloria clearly lulled the plaintiff into a false sense of
security
concerning the intentions of the defendants in relation to the estate of their
late father (saying, "Just trust me and everything
will be allright"), with the
consequence that the plaintiff, although aware of her rights and of the
existence of a time limitation
in respect to her father's estate, did not
direct her attention to her mother's estate until after the expiration of the
limitation
period in respect to that latter estate.
<P>

31   	All the plaintiff's concerns and expectations at that time
appear to have been directed to her interest in her father's estate,
and not to
any interest or rights which she might have had in the estate of her mother.
<P>

32   	At the time of Alec Manasseh's death his only asset was a
term deposit with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank in Singapore in
an amount
equivalent to $5,789. Charles arranged for that amount to be directed to a BT
account in Sydney which had originally been
opened in 1991 with an amount of
$20,000 from funds belonging to his father. Ultimately, in March 1997 Charles
redeemed the remaining
investments in that account and effected a distribution
of approximately one-third to each of the plaintiff, Gloria and himself,
in
accordance with the terms of his father's will. Since she had already received
an advance $1,000 from Charles on 29 July 1996,
the final distribution which
the plaintiff received in March 1997 was in an amount of $7,700 (that giving to
the plaintiff a total
amount slightly in excess of the amount received by each
of Gloria and Charles).
<P>

33   	The plaintiff as a child of the deceased is an eligible
person within paragraph (b) of the definition of that phrase contained
in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. As such, she has the standing
to bring the present proceedings. It will be appreciated that each of the
defendants, as a child of
the deceased, is also an eligible person within the
same paragraph of that definition. 
<P>

34   	Under the will of the deceased the plaintiff shares
equally with each of her brother and her sister the estate of their late
mother. The plaintiff asserts that she is entitled to an additional benefit
from that estate, in an amount of $60,000, for the purpose
of effecting
necessary repairs and restoration work to the Murriverie Road residence, and
converting part of the structure of that
residence from an unused shop into a
garage. 
<P>

35   	It must, however, be recognised that the present house
property of the plaintiff and the husband is a very valuable property.
It was
submitted on behalf of the defendants that there was no reason why the
plaintiff should be required to reside in a valuable
house property that needs
considerable restoration work, whilst it would be equally open to her and her
husband to sell that property
and to acquire, for the amount of the net
proceeds of sale, a property which did not need such expenditure in order to
raise it to
a properly habitable standard. 
<P>

36   	I am in agreement with that submission.
<P>

37   	Further, it will be appreciated that the plaintiff will
receive out of the estate of her late mother an amount of about $145,000
(or
possibly aout $152,600, although receipt of that latter amount would imply a
liability in the plaintiff of at least her own costs
of $22,478). That amount
will, in any event, be more than sufficient to effect the necessary repairs
costing about $60,000 (which
is the extent of the claim of the plaintiff). 
<P>

38   	It follows from the views which I have just expressed,
that I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has established that she
has been
left without adequate provision for her proper maintenance and advancement in
life (see <i>Singer v Berghouse </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a> at 208-209 per Mason CJ,
Deane and McHugh JJ). That conclusion is of itself sufficient to determine the
present proceedings.
<P>

39   	However, even if (contrary to the conclusion which I have
just expressed) I were of the view that the plaintiff had established
that she
had been left without such adequate provision, and that, in consequence, she
had established an entitlement to an order
for provision (be it in an amount of
$60,000 or in some lesser amount), that entitlement must be considered in the
context of the
competing claims upon the testamentary bounty of the deceased.
The only such competing claims are those of the defendants, each of
whom is,
under the will of the deceased, entitled to receive an amount equal to that
which the plaintiff will receive under that
will. 
<P>

40   	Evidence has been placed before the Court concerning the
financial and material circumstances of each of the defendants. 
<P>

41   	Exhibit A sets forth details of the assets and liabilities
of Charles and also additional information concerning moneys which
he had
received from his father and details of certain investments. 
<P>

42   	Charles's present assets consist of a house property
situate at 21 Honeywell Boulevard, Mirrabooka, Western Australia (having
an
estimated value of $80,000), a superannuation entitlement of $13,700, a BT
Hi-Yield Cash Management Trust ($8,000), EquitiLink
Trust Investment ($11,500),
Commonwealth Bank Savings Account ($600). 
<P>

43   	Charles has a HECS debt owing to the Australian Taxation
Office in an amount of $3,850. 
<P>

44   	Charles is presently aged thirty-seven. He is not married.
His occupation was described as that of legal word processing,
for which he
receives a current annual salary of $37,000.
<P>

45   	As has already been recorded, Charles was in a de facto
relationship with Faridah Mohamed from August 1988. That relationship
came to
an end in February 1994, a few months before the death of the father of the
parties, and about three years before the death
of the deceased.
<P>

46   	Gloria resides with her husband and their three children
(aged 17, 15 and 12) in the house property at Dianella, which is
registered in
her name and is unencumbered. The present value of that property is about
$190,000. Gloria and her husband also own
an investment property in Perth,
which they purchased in April 1996 for $120,500. Of that amount they provided
the sum of $65,500
towards the purchase price, the balance of $55,000 being
advanced by way of loan from BankWest, secured by mortgage. 
<P>

47   	Apart from those two pieces of real property the assets of
Gloria consist of shares ($15,000) and investments in various cash
management
trusts and similar trusts (totalling $84,246). 
<P>

48   	In addition to the mortgage loan in an amount of $55,000
owing to BankWest, Gloria also owes what is described as an equity
loan to
BankWest in an amount of $6,000, and has a credit card indebtedness of
$4,000.
<P>

49   	Gloria is not in employment. She receives an income of
about $5,000 a year from her investments.
<P>

50   	Gloria's husband, who is aged 64 and who suffers from
acute arthritis, will be retiring from full-time employment at the end
of 1999.
He presently earns an income of about $18,000 net a year. Details of Gloria's
financial and material circumstances are set
forth in Exhibit 1.
<P>

51   	I am not satisfied that the competing claims of the
defendants upon the bounty of their mother would have the effect of reducing,
or even extinguishing, any order for provision an entitlement to which the
plaintiff might otherwise have established. 
<P>

52   	I have already observed that the present proceedings were
instituted after the expiration of the eighteen month limitation
period
provided in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>.</i>
<P>

53   	The plaintiff was aware of the existence of such a
limitation period, as a consequence of the advice given to her by Tress,
Cox
and Maddox (albeit in the context of her father's estate, rather than her
mother's estate). She received that advice in January
1997, more than eight
months before the expiry of the limitation period in respect to her mother's
estate. I have already expressed
my opinion concerning the dishonourable
conduct of the defendants in deciding, upon the death of their mother, that
they would no
longer abide by the terms of the direction given by their father.
Equally dishonourable in my view was the conduct of Gloria in lulling
the
plaintiff into a sense of false security concerning what she would receive from
her father's estate, so that the plaintiff failed
to give consideration to
whether or not she should within time institute a claim against her mother's
estate.
<P>

54   	Whatever one might think of the morality of the conduct of
the defendants, I do not consider that that conduct of itself was
sufficient
cause for the plaintiff not instituting within time proceedings against the
estate of her mother, especially as she had
been expressly advised of a
limitation period under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>, and had received that
advice long before the expiry of that limitation period. Also before the expiry
of that limitation period
the plaintiff had become aware that the defendants
did not intend to honour the wishes of their father for the benefit of the
plaintiff.
<P>

55   	Accordingly I would not, in any event, be disposed to make
an order extending time for the institution of the present claim
of the
plaintiff. (Indeed, since I am not satisfied that sufficient cause has been
shown for the application not having been made
within time, I consider that I
am precluded by subsection (3) from proceeding to an exercise of the discretion
given by subsection
(2) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16.)</a> That conclusion of itself is also
sufficient to dispose of the present proceedings.
<P>

56   	I summarise as follows my foregoing views.
<P>

57   	I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has established an
entitlement to a benefit in an amount of $60,000 (or in any other
amount), in
addition to her entitlement of a one third interest in the estate of the
deceased which she receives under her late mother's
will.
<P>

58   	If, however, and contrary to the conclusion which I have
just expressed, the plaintiff were to have established such an entitlement,
then I do not consider that any such entitlement would have been reduced, or
extinguished, by reason of the competing claims of Gloria
and Charles upon the
estate of their late mother.
<P>

59   	However, in any event, the plaintiff is out of time in
bringing the present claim. I am not satisfied that the circumstances
which I
have already outlined concerning the awareness of the plaintiff of the relevant
limitation period, and concerning the conduct
of the defendants in relation to
the estate of their late father are such as to enliven the discretion vested in
the Court by subsection
(2) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16</a> to extend the limitation period or to
overcome the prohibition against the exercise of that discretion contained in
subsection (3)
of that section. That conclusion of itself is also sufficient to
dispose of the proceedings.
<P>

60   	It follows, therefore, that the claim of the plaintiff
must be dismissed.
<P>

61   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the summons be dismissed.
<P>

2.	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the defendants, such costs to be
on the party and party basis, and that the defendants
be entitled to retain out
of the estate of the late Paula Flora Manasseh ("the deceased") the difference
between such costs and the
costs of the defendants on the indemnity basis.
