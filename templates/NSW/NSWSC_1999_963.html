2/95		<b>KERRY GOODWIN   v   B.A. LA MACCHIA &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  Kerry Goodwin is seeking damages in respect of
personal injuries which she sustained whilst working as a deckhand
and cook on
a fishing trawler known as "Tagula Bay".  The accident happened on 10 January
1992 off the Queensland coast from Yeppoon,
somewhere near Great Keppel
Island.
<P>

2  	The plaintiff has joined four defendants in this cause:  the
first defendant is B.A. La Macchia, who is sued as the owner of
the "Tagula
Bay"; the second defendant is William Easdown, who became a receiver appointed
in circumstances to which I shall presently
refer; the third defendant is
Texole Pty Limited, who it is claimed employed the crew of the vessel; and the
fourth defendant is
Steven Walker, who it is claimed was the skipper of the
"Tagula Bay".
<P>

3  	The case has presented an issue as to the plaintiff's status on
the trawler and, if the plaintiff was an employee, there is
an issue as to the
identity of her employer.  However, at the outset it is convenient to consider
the circumstances in which the
plaintiff sustained her injuries.
<P>

<b>The circumstances of the accident and the issue of negligence</b>
<P>

4  	The accident happened after dark on 10 January 1992, although I
am satisfied that the vessel was well lit and that the time
of the occurrence
assumes no practical significance.  The plaintiff was engaged in paying out a
lazy line, an integral task in the
process of putting out the trawling nets.
This process has been described in evidence as <i>"shooting out"</i>.  It
involved casting the nets out to sea, and these nets, two in number, were
connected by a line called a marriage line.  There
were two other attachment
lines known as "lazy lines", and these lazy lines had to be connected by clips
to the top of the fishing
nets.  Each of the lazy lines were paid out from a
winch, and the process of paying out the lazy lines required the services of
two
deckhands, that is to say one working on each line.  
<P>

5  	The winches from which these lines were paid out were located on
an upper deck of the trawler which was some twelve feet above
the deck where
the plaintiff and the second deckhand were required to stand.  The "Tagula Bay"
was described as being some twenty-five
to twenty-six feet wide and the console
from which the winch controls were operated was located midway across the winch
deck.  The
operator of the winches stood facing the stern as he controlled the
winches which were hydraulically operated.  I am satisfied on
the evidence that
from his control point the winch operator was able to see each deckhand
involved in paying out the lazy lines,
as they proceeded with their tasks on
the deck below him.  Exhibit B is a photo which depicts where the plaintiff was
required to
stand, the location of the winch deck and the path of the lines
from the point of leaving the winches.
<P>

6  	In paying out the lazy line which the plaintiff was required to
attend, her task required her to grasp the lazy line above her
head and to pull
it downwards in a "hand over hand" fashion by her outboard side.
<P>

7  	The plaintiff's evidence was that as she was paying out the lazy
line it was coming freely when it <i>"just changed direction suddenly"</i> and
<i>"reversed suddenly"</i>.  The plaintiff then described what occurred in the
following response (T 15):
<P>

<i>"I was just jerked suddenly up in the air hanging on to the rope because I
had a firm grip on it, pulling it one way and when it reversed
it just yanked
me up in the air."</i>
<P>

8  	The plaintiff said that she was lifted some ten to fifteen feet
into the air before she let go, falling to the deck and sustaining
the injuries
I shall later identify.
<P>

9  	Steven Walker was the skipper of the trawler at the time and he
was operating the relevant winch when the plaintiff was injured.
 He did not
actually see the plaintiff being lifted from the deck.  His account was as
follows (T 164):
<P>

<i>"A.	Well I was working the winch looking at both parties, I noticed watching
each winch the winch had back fed.  I observed Kerry
being hauled in the air.
I immediately stopped the winch and she fell to the deck.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	You saw her being hauled into the air?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I didn't actually see her come off the deck.  I seen her when she started
to come back down as in level, well not level with me
either, just down like
that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	What kind of motion then did you have to execute to stop the
winch?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I had to apply the lever to neutral.  I had to push the lever down to
neutral.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	What did you do then?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	After I had put it into neutral?</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Yes?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Raced downstairs to attend to Kerry."</i>
<P>

10  	I am satisfied that the accident happened in the manner
described by the plaintiff.
<P>

11  	It was submitted on the plaintiff's behalf that had the fourth
defendant been watching closely he would have been able to stop
the winch
before the plaintiff was hoisted into the air and that her accident could thus
have been avoided.
<P>

12  	The evidence in the case satisfies me on the balance of
probabilities that it was by no means a rare occurrence for the lazy
line to
suddenly reverse during the paying out process.  The plaintiff gave evidence of
this having happened before and so too did
Miss Hibbard.  I accept their
evidence to that effect.  Indeed, the fourth defendant acknowledged in his
evidence that overriding,
or <i>"back feed"</i> as he described it (T 163), can
occur, and that this was <i>"very common"</i> (T 171).
<P>

13  	I am satisfied that the tendency for the operation of the winch
to reverse the direction of the lazy line was foreseeable and
that it created a
foreseeable risk of the deckhand who was paying out the lazy line being hoisted
from the deck.  I am satisfied
that this was a risk of which the fourth
defendant was aware or of which he ought to have been aware.  Indeed, Miss
Hibbard gave
evidence that she had been paying out the lazy line on an occasion
before the plaintiff's injury when the fourth defendant was the
winch operator
for Miss Hibbard and that she had been jerked up off the deck.  Although the
fourth defendant said he had not been
the winch operator for Miss Hibbard, Miss
Hibbard was not cross examined about the evidence in point which she gave, and
I accept
it.
<P>

14  	It seems to me that the very nature of the operation of the
paying out of the lazy line required the winch operator to keep
a close look
out having regard to the very risk to which the plaintiff was exposed, so as to
be able quickly to stop the winch if
overriding occurred.
<P>

15  	There was evidence placed before the Court, which evidence I
accept, that it was possible to obviate or minimise the risk of
what happened
to the plaintiff from occurring by prompt response by the winch operator:  the
plaintiff gave evidence that she had
experienced the overriding before and that
<i>"usually the person operating the winch would stop it straight away"</i> and
that this would <i>"just stop the rope dead"</i> (T 14).  Later (T 60), the
plaintiff referred to the practice of letting go of the rope if there was
overriding but said <i>"usually you wouldn't have to, because the skipper would
turn it off"</i>.  Then Miss Hibbard gave evidence as to the response in the
winch once the lever was operated to stop the override.  She described
the
response of the rope to the operation of the lever as <i>"usually pretty
instant"</i> and agreed that the lever operation brought about <i>"an immediate
reaction on the spool of the winch"</i>.
<P>

16  	Mr Toghill, the expert relied upon by the plaintiff, had no
opportunity of inspecting the winch on the "Tagula Bay" but, notwithstanding
this fact and notwithstanding concessions elsewhere made by Mr Toghill in cross
examination by Mr Stevens, I accept the evidence
which Mr Toghill ultimately
gave (T 113-114) that regardless of whether the winch was hydraulically
controlled or electronically
controlled he would have expected a winch operator
exercising proper diligence in the control of the winch to be able to shut the
winch off in time to prevent a deckhand paying out the lazy line from being
hoisted into the air.
<P>

17  	The fourth defendant gave evidence contrary to that which I have
just reviewed and said that the winch operator could not react
quickly enough
to overriding so as to prevent a deckhand being lifted off the deck (T 175),
but I prefer the preponderance of evidence
before me to the contrary.
<P>

18  	Mr Stevens submitted that because the winch operator had to
watch and control the operation of two winches at the same time,
he could not
be expected to have kept the plaintiff under observation all the time, and that
casual negligence had not been proved.
 However, having reflected on the
relevant evidence and the competing submissions, I have concluded that the
arguments advanced on
the plaintiff's behalf are to be preferred.  Accepting,
as I do, the evidence to which I have already referred from the plaintiff,
Miss
Hibbard and Mr Toghill, I am satisfied that had the fourth defendant been
keeping a proper look out he would have detected the
overriding in sufficient
time to have prevented the plaintiff from being lifted from the deck in the
manner in which she was, and
that his prompt response by placing the winch
lever into neutral would have avoided the harm which the plaintiff
sustained.
<P>

19  	Accordingly I am satisfied that casual negligence by the fourth
defendant has been proved.
<P>

20  	Mr King adopted in effect an element in the fourth defendant's
cross claim against the other defendants, asserting that the
winch equipment
should have been modified in such a manner as would have reduced the risk to
the winch operator.  The contention
was that there could have been installed a
free-riding bar to minimise the risk of back-feeding of the lazy line or
alternatively
there could have been installed a large A frame on the stern rail
of the vessel.  These suggested modifications were addressed in
Mr Walker's
report tendered as Exhibit 4.
<P>

21  	Mr Walker said he had seen these devices on some trawlers but
did not contend they were invariably employed.
<P>

22  	Mr Toghill was cross examined about the use of such devices.  It
would be fair to summarise his responses as being that he
was not enthusiastic
about their proposed uses.  He had never seen an A frame mounted in front of
the deckhands' position and had
never heard it suggested as a modification
until he gave his evidence.  When cross examined by Mr Stevens about the use of
the A
frame device, Mr Toghill was asked the following questions and gave the
following answers (T 110):
<P>

<i>"Q.	If she is standing to the aft of the A frame and she is pulling it under
the horn, then she wouldn't go up into the rigging?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	If it, this on the transom.  The transom is on the rear end of the
boat.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	If she is standing aft of that A frame?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	You are saying if the A frame is ---</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	If that A frame is situated with sufficient working space for the
employee to pull the rope under the horn, and if she stands to
the aft of the
horn, then she can't be pulled up into the rigging?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	That's correct.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Her hand could be pulled into the horn?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	She might mangle her hand?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	But that would effectively prevent the accident happening, which is
alleged to have happened on the `Tagula Bay'?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It would prevent her being pulled up, yes."</i>
<P>

23  	It would seem from Mr Toghill's evidence to which I have just
referred that the use of the A frame, whilst it may have minimised
the risk of
the plaintiff being hoisted into the air would have introduced an alternative
risk of hand damage.
<P>

24  	I am not convinced that either the free-riding bar or the A
frame suggested was a practicable modification which should have
been
introduced by those responsible for the equipment on this trawler.  I am not
satisfied on the balance of probabilities that
the failure to have either such
modification was unreasonable so as to amount to negligence.
<P>

25  	The result is that I am satisfied that there was the casual
negligence on the part of the fourth defendant that I have identified
but no
other head of negligence has been proved.
<P>

26  	Contributory negligence has been raised as against the
plaintiff.  This defence was pleaded on behalf of the first defendant,
the
second defendant, the third defendant and the fourth defendant, although it was
really only pressed at the hearing by the second
and the fourth defendants.
<P>

27  	There were two aspects in particular the focus of the defence.
The first was that the plaintiff, possibly because she had a
weakened arm by
reason of an earlier injury, had wrapped the lazy line around her forearm.
Indeed Mr Stevens submitted that the reason
why she was lifted from the deck at
all was because she had done this.  He submitted that in the plaintiff's
behaviour in this regard
was the explanation for the accident, that I should so
find and that in consequence should find that the accident was due only to
the
plaintiff's negligence.  In the alternative though, he submitted that the
plaintiff's behaviour amounted to contributory negligence.
<P>

28  	In cross examination the plaintiff denied that she had wrapped
the rope around her forearm.  The plaintiff was subjected to
testing cross
examination on this issue but the plaintiff impressed me generally as being an
honest and reliable witness and I accept
the evidence that the plaintiff gave
that she did not wrap the rope around her arm.
<P>

29  	The fourth defendant of course had the plaintiff under
observation prior to the accident as she worked on the lazy line and
he gave no
evidence that he had seen the plaintiff wrap the rope around her arm.  Had the
plaintiff done this Mr Walker would have
been in a position to see the
plaintiff adopting this unsafe procedure.
<P>

30  	There was no direct evidence to support the contention that the
plaintiff handled the rope in this improper way.  What was
relied upon by Mr
Stevens and by Mr Mescher were matters of history recorded in hospital records.
In the Yeppoon Hospital records
(Exhibit 3), the following was recorded:
<P>

<i>"History of R arm caught in rope in winch, hauled up, then falling 12 ft
from mast of boat."</i>
<P>

There is a second matter of history recorded in Exhibit 3 in these terms:
<P>

<i>"Working on back deck of trawler, rope caught around R elbow.  Fell 10-12 ft
on to deck on all 4s."</i>
<P>

31  	Then in the report from the Illawarra Hospital, part of Exhibit
A, there is a reference to the plaintiff having sustained (inter
alia)
<i>"minor abrasions right arm"</i>.
<P>

32  	I am asked to infer that the plaintiff was the source of those
matters of history on which the head of contributory negligence
is based and
further that whoever it was that recorded the various notes did so
accurately.
<P>

33  	Accepting as I do the sworn evidence which the plaintiff gave
that she did not wrap the rope around her arm, I do not find
that the hospital
notes establish the contrary.
<P>

34  	It is not clear what the source was for any of those matters of
history above set out but, having regard to the plaintiff's
evidence in this
Court, the defendants have not persuaded me that the plaintiff gave either of
the histories abovementioned.  Nor
do I consider the reference in the Illawarra
notes to abrasions to the right arm to establish that the plaintiff had wrapped
the
rope around her right arm as contended.
<P>

35  	It is, of course, for the defendants relying upon contributory
negligence to prove this defence and it has not been proved
on the balance of
probabilities that the plaintiff sustained any abrasion as a consequence of
handling the lazy line without the
exercise of reasonable care.
<P>

36  	The other aspect of contributory negligence upon which reliance
has been placed is that the plaintiff should have let go of
the lazy line
before she did.  The plaintiff's evidence about this was that she did let go as
quickly as she could.  There was close
cross examination about this (see, for
instance, T 45-46).  Miss Hibbard, who was very experienced as a deckhand on
fishing trawlers
with some eleven to twelve years experience, gave evidence the
effect of which was that once overriding occurred the deckhand had
to rely upon
the winch operator and that there was no time for the deckhand to let go.  In
cross examination at T 84-85 Miss Hibbard
gave the following evidence:
<P>

<i>"Q.	Once the deckhand feels that tightness or reverse action occurring, the
appropriate remedy is to let go of the rope, would you
agree with that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	Stop the winch.  It happens very quickly.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	What I am suggesting to you is that another way of avoiding having any
accident during the course of that operation, is to let
go of the rope
immediately, would you agree with that?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It doesn't work like that.  There is not enough time.  It happens so
quickly.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	When you say it happens so quickly, it takes at least a few seconds,
doesn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	No, it is quicker than that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Before it occurs?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	It is quicker than that.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	Would you agree it would be about 2 to 3 seconds at least?</i>
<P>

<i>A.	I have had it happen to me on another boat, and it was one second you are
on the deck, the next second you are up in the air. 
It happens that
quickly.</i>
<P>

<i>Q.	I am trying to obtain an estimate of the time it would take--</i>
<P>

<i>A.	There is no time to let go.  That was my own experience when it happened
to me on another boat."</i>
<P>

37  	I was generally impressed with Miss Hibbard as a witness and
evaluating her evidence and that of the plaintiff on this particular
issue the
defendants have failed to satisfy me that the plaintiff was negligent in
failing to let go of the rope any earlier than
she did.
<P>

38  	The defence of contributory negligence has not been proved
against the plaintiff.
<P>

<b>The basis upon which damages are to be assessed</b>
<P>

39  	This accident happened off the coast of Queensland and the
parties invited me to approach the matter therefore upon the basis
that it
occurred in Queensland.  How then are damages to be assessed?
<P>

40  	I am satisfied that the status of the plaintiff on the "Tagula
Bay" was that of employee.  For reasons I shall state later,
I find that the
plaintiff was employed at the relevant time by the third defendant.  I find
that the plaintiff was working under
a contract of service rather than a
contract for services.  Had the accident happened in New South Wales, the
provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act, 1987</a></i> would govern the
assessment of damages against her employer.
<P>

41  	The plaintiff was not, of course, engaged in New South Wales but
in Queensland.  Neither was she required to work in New South
Wales but in
Queensland.  There is no evidence to suggest that there was in place a policy
of insurance insuring the plaintiff's
employer against liability to provide
compensation benefits to the plaintiff under the New South Wales <i>Workers'
Compensation Act</i>.  
<P>

42  	Exhibit 1 discloses that in January 1992 the third defendant had
its registered office at <i>"The Meadows Convenience Centre, Shop 10, 63
Karawatha Street, Buderim"</i> in the State of Queensland and that its
principal place of business was at 24 Poinciana Avenue, Mooloolaba,
Queensland.
<P>

43  	Exhibit K, being the agreement whereunder the third defendant
operated the "Tagula Bay", identified the proper law governing
the agreement as
the law of Queensland and stated a Queensland address for the third
defendant.
<P>

44  	What links the plaintiff's accident to New South Wales is simply
that the plaintiff returned to New South Wales after her accident,
had part of
her treatment in this State in Wollongong and therefore suffered part of her
damage in New South Wales.
<P>

45  	There have been a number of decisions in the past decade or so
which have addressed the problem that arises in the present
case.  
<P>

46  	In <i>Breavington v Godelman</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%2d89%29%20169%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988-89) 169 CLR 41</a> the High
Court was concerned with a case involving a collision in the Northern Territory
at a time when all parties were residents
in the Northern Territory.  However
later the plaintiff moved to Victoria and brought proceedings there.  The issue
that arose was
whether Northern Territory legislation precluded the plaintiff
from recovering damages other than for pain and suffering and loss
of the
amenities of life.  The trial judge ordered that a defence in reliance upon
provisions of the Northern Territory legislation
be struck out because the law
to be applied was the lex fori, that is the law of Victoria.  On appeal to the
Full Court of the Supreme
Court of Victoria, the trial judge's decision was
reversed.  The plaintiff appealed to the High Court, arguing that the law of
Victoria
was to be applied and that the law of the place where the tort had
happened, the Northern Territory, was irrelevant.  The appeal
was dismissed.
<P>

47  	Because the reasons of the justices of the High Court differed
in <i>Breavington</i> it is not easy to distil a common principle from the
various judgments.  Subsequently in <i>Byrnes v Groote Eylandt Mining</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=10%20MVR%20297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">10
MVR 297</a> the decision in <i>Breavington</i> was considered.  In his judgment
Kirby P reviewed the various judgments in <i>Breavington</i>, observing at
301:
<P>

<i>"Because of the differences in the reasoning of the justices it is not easy
to derive the holding in Breavington which is binding
on this, as on other
Australian courts."</i>
<P>

48  	Kirby P favoured the approach that Mason CJ had adopted in
<i>Byrnes</i> when the Chief Justice rejected the argument that the principles
for the assessment of damages should be regarded as procedural law
and be
governed by the law of the forum.  The Chief Justice considered the measure of
damages was a question of substantive law and
this was the approach which found
favour with Kirby P but the President remarked the Chief Justice's approach was
not followed by
the other justices of the High Court in <i>Breavington</i>.
<P>

49  	On the other hand Hope A-JA observed, concerning the decisions
of the High Court in <i>Breavington</i> (at 314-315):
<P>

<i>"The judgments of the members of the court arrived at this conclusion in
varying ways, but all held that the law of the lex loci delicti,
that is
Northern Territory, and not lex fori, that is the law of Victoria, applied as
regards the damages which the plaintiff might
recover.  An approach adopted by
some members of the court was to adopt the principles of private international
law previously applied
in such a case to the requirements of the federal system
such as exists in Australia, in order, inter alia, to prevent forum shopping.
For this purpose, even if principles as to damages were part of procedural law
as opposed to substantive law for ordinary private
international purposes, they
were to be regarded as part of the substantive law in the adaptation of those
principles to the States
and Territories of Australia."</i>
<P>

50  	On the above analysis of Hope A-JA, the principles of the
assessment of damages were to be regarded as part of the substantive
law.
<P>

51  	However there then followed the decisions of the High Court in
<i>McKain v R.W. Miller &amp; Co (SA) Pty Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20174%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 174 CLR 1</a> and in
<i>Stevens v Head</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20176%20CLR%20433" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 176 CLR 433.</a>  Since the decisions in these two
cases, it seems to be settled that, prima facie at least, the quantification of
damages is governed
by the law of the forum.
<P>

52  	In <i>McKain </i>the principles relating to interstate torts
were defined by the majority of the court (at 39):
<P>

<i>"A plaintiff may sue in the forum to enforce a liability in respect of a
wrong occurring outside the territory of the forum if - 1.
the claim arises out
of circumstances of such a character that, if they had occurred within the
territory of the forum, a cause of
action would have arisen entitling the
plaintiff to enforce against the defendant a civil liability of the kind which
the plaintiff
claims to enforce; and 2. by the law of the place in which the
wrong occurred, the circumstances of the occurrence gave rise to a
civil
liability of the kind which the plaintiff claims to enforce."</i>
<P>

53  	Later in <i>Stevens</i> a plaintiff injured in a motor vehicle
accident in New South Wales claimed damages in Queensland and the judge at the
trial assessed
damages according to Queensland law and did not apply the
provisions of s 79 of the <i>Motor Accidents Act</i> which govern the
assessment of damages in respect of motor accidents in proceedings in New South
Wales.  The High Court, by majority,
determined that approach was correct and
that once, consistently with <i>McKain</i>, an action was maintainable, the
quantification of damages was to be determined by the law of the forum.
<P>

54  	In their joint judgment in <i>Stevens</i>, Brennan, Dawson,
Toohey and McHugh JJ said at 456-457:
<P>

<i>"In determining whether, by the lex loci, the relevant facts give rise to a
civil liability of the kind which the plaintiff seeks
to enforce, the courts of
the forum distinguish between substantive and procedural laws. Procedure is
governed exclusively by the
laws of the forum, but the substantive laws of the
place of the tort determine whether, by those laws, there exists a civil
liability
of the kind which the plaintiff seeks to enforce. In McKain, it was
held that a South Australian law which imposed a limitation on
the time within
which to bring an action in the courts of that State for damages for a tort
committed within that State but which
did not extinguish the cause of action
was not a substantive law which precluded the bringing of an action in the
courts of New South
Wales for damages for a tort committed in South Australia.
The majority followed a line of authority ((1991) 174 CLR at 40-43) which
distinguished between a statute of limitation which does no more than cut off
resort to the courts for the enforcement of a claim
and a statute which
extinguishes civil liability and destroys a cause of action.  The former is
classified as a procedural law, the
latter as substantive."</i>
<P>

55  	Their Honours later went on to say, as to s 79 (at 460):
<P>

<i>"It follows that s.79 of the Motor Accidents Act is not to be construed as
containing substantive provisions for the purposes of the
conflict of law rules
governing the assessment of damages for extraterritorial but intranational
torts. Adopting the distinction
between heads of damage and the quantification
of damages in respect of heads of damage, s.79 is a law with respect to
quantification.
 Therefore it is not the law which a Queensland court applies
in assessing damages for non-economic loss suffered by a plaintiff
who was
injured in an accident occurring in New South Wales...  Double actionability
(in the sense explained in McKain) operates
satisfactorily, with respect to
causes of action; with respect to the quantification of damages, no law other
than the lex loci can
work effectively."</i>
<P>

56  	Following <i>Stevens v Head</i>, at least in the absence of any
relevant statutory provision to the contrary, the law of the forum governs the
assessment of damages,
but the substantive laws of the lex loci have their role
in determining whether there is a civil liability in the person sued.
<P>

57  	The provisions of Pt 5 of the New South Wales <i>Workers'
Compensation Act</i> in their application to the assessment of damages in
proceedings in New South Wales are by analogy to the scheme under the <i>Motor
Accidents Act</i> to be regarded as procedural.  Indeed, the full court of the
Federal Court so held in <i>John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson </i>(unreported, 9
July 1998).  However, Mr King submitted that even if the law governing the
assessment of damages is to be classified
as procedural, I should still assess
damages without reference to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers' Compensation Act, </i>1987</a> as
amended.  He submitted that I should adopt that approach in any event, by the
application of the <i>Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross Vesting) Act,
</i>1987<i>,</i> and he referred to an interlocutory application earlier made
in this court in these proceedings.
<P>

58  	After the originating process had been served in this cause, at
a time when there were nine defendants, application was made
by one of those
defendants, supported by most of the other defendants, for the transfer of this
cause to Queensland pursuant to s
5(2)(b)(iii) of the <i>Jurisdiction of Courts
(Cross Vesting) Act, </i>1987.  Newman J dismissed the application, and it is
plain from a reading of his Honour's judgment that the judge was influenced in
so doing by the fact that most of the plaintiff's treatment was carried out in
New South Wales and that her indigent circumstances
would have made it
difficult for her to sue in Queensland.  In the circumstances no order was made
by his Honour other than the order
for costs.  Had an order for transfer been
made, then of course damages would have been assessed without reference to the
New South
Wales workers' compensation legislation.
<P>

59  	Mr King submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that I should
approach the matter upon the basis that this Court has jurisdiction
under the
<i>Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross Vesting) Act</i> and by reason of s 4, in
conjunction with s 11(1)(c), I should apply the law of Queensland to the
assessment of damages, considering
it appropriate in the circumstances to do
so.
<P>

60  	Mr Longhurst, on behalf of the first and third defendants,
adopted Mr King's submissions under the <i>Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross
Vesting) Act</i>.
<P>

61  	Mr Mescher and Mr Stevens in their respective written
submissions urged me to take a different approach.  They both submitted
that
the proper application of s 11 of the <i>Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross Vesting)
Act</i> attracts the application of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers' Compensation
Act</a></i>.
<P>

62  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 11(1)</a> of the statute provides:
<P>

<i>"Where it appears to a court that the court will, or will be likely to, in
determining a matter for determination in a proceeding,
be exercising
jurisdiction conferred by this Act or by a law of the Commonwealth or a State
relating to cross-vesting of jurisdiction:
</i>
<P>

<i>(a) 	subject to paragraphs (b) and (c), the court shall, in determining that
matter, apply the law in force in the State or Territory
in which the court is
sitting (including choice of law rules); </i>
<P>

<i>(b) 	subject to paragraph (c), if that matter is a right of action arising
under a written law of another State or Territory, the
court shall, in
determining that matter, apply the written and unwritten law of that other
State or Territory; and </i>
<P>

<i>(c) 	the rules of evidence and procedure to be applied in dealing with that
matter shall be such as the court considers appropriate
in the circumstances,
being rules that are applied in a superior court in Australia or in an external
Territory."</i>
<P>

63  	It would, in my view, be an odd and unsatisfactory result if
damages were required to be assessed in this case by reference
to the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers' Compensation Act,</i> 1987</a> (NSW), not only because the accident did
not happen in this State but the services of the plaintiff were not engaged
here.  Moreover,
there is no evidence to suggest that the employer/defendant
had a policy of insurance complying with the legislation in New South
Wales, or
that it ever contemplated the need for such a policy.  It did not employ
workers in this State and it did not carry out
its operations in this State.
The plaintiff was not employed in New South Wales nor was it in contemplation
that she would be required
to perform any part of her contract of service in
New South Wales.  Accordingly, if the statute would otherwise govern the
assessment
of the plaintiff's damages, and the discretion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11(1)(c)</a> of
the cross vesting statute was enlivened, I would regard it as appropriate to
order that the rules of procedure (governing the
quantification of damages) of
the State of Queensland apply to the assessment, so as to avoid the application
of the statute.
<P>

64  	However I do not consider that it is correct to proceed on the
basis that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11(1)</a> of the cross vesting statute has become applicable.  Newman
J made no order under the cross vesting legislation, and in my opinion
this
Court is not strictly hearing this case by reason of jurisdiction extended to
it under the <i>Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross Vesting) Act</i> at all.  The
Supreme Court of New South Wales has jurisdiction to hear this case
independently of the cross vesting legislation.
Much of the plaintiff's harm
attracting an entitlement to damages has been suffered in New South Wales.
More fundamentally though,
by reason of effective service of the statement of
claim upon the defendants, each of the defendants filed appearances and in due
course a defence.  No challenge was made to the jurisdiction of this Court.
The application under the cross vesting legislation did
not challenge the
jurisdiction of this Court, but sought transfer to Queensland on the basis that
the interests of justice called
for a transfer on the well settled principles
identified in <i>Bankinvest AG v Seabrook &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20711" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 14 NSWLR 711.</a>
<P>

65  	For these reasons I have concluded I should not, and indeed I
cannot, make the order Mr King and Mr Longhurst have asked me
to make to apply
the procedural laws of Queensland.  In my opinion, following <i>Stevens v
Head</i>, damages are to be assessed by the application of the appropriate law
of New South Wales.
<P>

66  	It does not follow however that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers' Compensation
Act</a></i> of 1987 necessarily applies.  That statute does not govern the
assessment of damages in all cases.  It only applies, speaking generally,
to
work related injuries addressed by the statute.
<P>

67  	To begin with, the Act has no application to cases not involving
<i>"injury"</i> as defined in s 4.  For relevant purposes, s 4 defines
<i>"injury"</i> as meaning <i>"personal injury arising out of or in the course
of employment.</i>
<P>

68  	However, the ambit of the statute to <i>"injury"</i> as defined
extends outside New South Wales only in the circumstances contemplated in s
13(1):
<P>

<i>"(1)	If:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	an employer has a place of employment in New South Wales, or is for the
time being present in New South Wales, and there employs
a worker, and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	any such worker while outside New South Wales receives an injury under
circumstances which, had the injury been received in New
South Wales, would
entitle the worker to compensation in accordance with this Act,</i>
<P>

<i>	the injury is an injury to which this Act applies, and compensation is
payable accordingly."</i>
<P>

69  	Because the plaintiff's employer has not been proved to have had
a place of employment in New South Wales at any relevant time,
and because it
has not been proved to be present in New South Wales and there to have employed
the plaintiff, s 13(1) has no proven
application in this case.
<P>

70  	In my opinion it follows that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 3</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers'
Compensation Act</a></i> which provides for compensation benefits has no
application and had the plaintiff sought to recover benefits under that
provision
from her employer, her application would have been doomed to fail.
<P>

71  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Part 5</a> makes provision for common law damages in a modified form
only in respect of <i>"an injury to a worker"</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151e.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 151E(1)(a)).</a>  However <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
151</a> expressly preserves common law liability not affected by the Act:  
<P>

<i>"This Act does not affect any liability in respect of an injury to a worker
that exists independently of this Act, except to the extent
that this Act
-</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	otherwise expressly provides."</i>
<P>

72  	The definition of <i>"injury"</i> in s 4, which I have set out
above, applies to Pt 3 and Pt 5 alike, so that when Pt 5 introduces modified
common law damages, it
does so <i>"for personal injury arising out of or in the
course of employment"</i>, but there is nothing in Pt 5 to indicate that the
provisions of that part apply to injuries beyond those contemplated in Pt 3.
It
follows, in my opinion, that Pt 5 can and does only apply to injury
sustained outside New South Wales if:
<P>

<i>"(a)	an employer has a place of employment in New South Wales, or is for the
time being present in New South Wales, and there employs
a worker, and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	any such worker while outside New South Wales receives an injury under
circumstances which, had the injury been received in New
South Wales, would
entitle the worker to compensation in accordance with this Act,</i>
<P>

Subparagraph (a) has not been satisfied here.
<P>

73  	In this case, since the plaintiff has sued her employer and
parties other than her employer, were the statute to apply, it
would be
necessary to consider whether s 151Z of the statute applies, calling for
separate assessment of damages and giving rise
to the complexities and
anomalies considered by Allen J in <i>Leonard v Smith </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2027%20NSWLR%205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 27 NSWLR 5</a> and
by me in <i>Smith v Leighton Contractors &amp; Anor</i>, (unreported, 19 June
1998).
<P>

74  	However s 151Z, in addressing this possibility of recovery
against both the employer and a stranger begins:
<P>

<i>"</i><cite>If the injury for which compensation is payable under this
Act</cite><i> was caused under circumstances creating a liability in some
person other than the worker's employer to pay damages in respect of
the injury
the following provisions have effect:"</i>
<P>

75  	The reference to compensation being payable under the Act is a
reference to compensation under Pt 3.  Compensation was plainly
not payable to
this plaintiff under Pt 3 because the plaintiff's injuries were sustained
outside New South Wales and did not attract
an entitlement to benefits under s
13(1).  It seems to me that s 151Z affords a further clear indication, if such
were needed, that
the provisions of Pt 5 do not attach to <i>"an injury"</i>
sustained in circumstances that gave rise to no right to compensation under Pt
3.  
<P>

76  	I refer also to Pt 7 Div 1 of the statute, which deals with
insurance.  Section 155 renders it compulsory for an employer to
obtain and
maintain in force a statutory policy.  Section 155(1) provides:
<P>

<i>"An employer (other than a self insurer) shall obtain from a licensed
insurer, and maintain in force, a policy of insurance that complies
with this
Division for the full amount of the employer's liability under this Act in
respect of all workers employed by the employer
and for an unlimited amount in
respect of the employer's liability independently of this Act..."</i>
<P>

77  	The sub-section provides for a penalty for the failure to obtain
and maintain such a policy of 200 penalty units or imprisonment
for six months
or both.
<P>

78  	It would be an extraordinary result if the legislature intended
to render an employer which is not conducting business in this
State and which
is not employing a worker to carry out duties here, liable to an offence for
not maintaining a policy complying with
Pt 7.  Such a requirement by the
legislature would be invalid.  In order to attract the provisions of the Act,
the legislature would
be required to introduce some element so as to
sufficiently connect the compensable injury to the State:  see the discussion
on s
13 in <i>Mills Workers' Compensation Practice</i> at p 1850.
<P>

79  	In my opinion the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers' Compensation Act</a></i> does not
govern the assessment of damages in this case because I do not find on the
evidence that the plaintiff sustained her injuries
in circumstances attracting
liability in her employer under s 13(1).
<P>

80  	I conclude that damages are to be assessed by reference to
common law principles as applicable in New South Wales.
<P>

<b>The plaintiff's injuries and disabilities</b>
<P>

81  	The evidence satisfies me that the plaintiff sustained injuries
to her left upper limb, to her left knee, to her right foot
and to her nose.
<P>

82  	The plaintiff had been injured before and, indeed, she had
fractured her left forearm and injured her neck in a motor vehicle
accident in
the `70s.  In 1981 she fell and refractured the left forearm.  The injury to
that forearm was treated by Dr Conacher
successfully, according to the
plaintiff, and she was able to return to quite heavy work as a barmaid and
later as a deckhand.  Miss
Hibbard, who worked with the plaintiff on the
"Caledon Bay" and the "Tagula Bay", observed no physical disability and I
accept, as
Miss Hibbard said, that the work on the fishing trawlers is
physically demanding.  I accept that the plaintiff was able to work without
restrictions by reason of her earlier injuries as at the time of the accident
on the "Tagula Bay".
<P>

83  	The plaintiff was taken from the "Tagula Bay" to Yeppoon
Hospital.  X-rays revealed a fracture of the left patella, a fracture
of the
left radius and a possible impacted fracture of the right heel.  The plaintiff
was transferred to Rockhampton Base Hospital
on the same day and on 12 January
1992 an operation was carried out to reduce the fracture of the patella.  The
left ankle and calcaneum
were immobilised under anaesthetic and stabilised in a
back slab.  On 16 January 1992 the plaintiff was discharged to return home
to
Wollongong.
<P>

84  	On the following day the plaintiff was admitted to hospital in
Wollongong under the care of Dr Panjrathan.  He found that the
patella
fragments had separated and revised the wiring of the left patella.  He
performed an open reduction procedure on the left
radius and fixed it
internally.  The fracture of the right heel was treated conservatively.  The
plaintiff was discharged on 13 February
1992.  After some follow-up visits to
Dr Panjrathan the plaintiff was referred to Dr Maloney and Dr Maloney performed
a number of
operations on the plaintiff:
<P>

(i)	On 22 April 1992 Dr Maloney performed a partial patellectomy.  That
procedure proved to be successful in alleviating to a very
large extent the
plaintiff's problems in the left knee.
<P>

(ii)	On 5 August 1992 Dr Maloney performed an arthodesis procedure to address
the right heel problem and used bone from the right
iliac crest.  At the same
time he realigned the heel cord.  Following that procedure the right leg was
immobilised in plaster until
15 October 1992.
<P>

(iii)	On 16 December 1992 Dr Maloney performed a further procedure to reduce
discomfort in the right heel.  This procedure was in
the nature of a closed
wedge osteotomy of the os calcis.  
<P>

(iv)	Because of persisting problems in the foot which the doctor felt were
coming from the mid foot area, Dr Maloney operated again
on 21 April 1993,
performing a fusion of the mid tarsal joints.
<P>

85  	Those procedures were successful in reducing the plaintiff's
problems with the right foot.
<P>

86  	The plaintiff has been reviewed from time to time by Dr Maloney
and I accept Dr Maloney's assessment in this case.  He reported
on 23 April
1996 that the plaintiff's prognosis was as follows:
<P>

<i>"One is quite pleased to see the level of function present in the left
forearm, wrist and hand considering the mal-union present in
the fractured
radius.  However there still remains a significant cosmetic disability in this
region, but fortunately Mrs Goodwin
feels she has had enough of surgery over
the past few years and is happy enough to accept the present cosmetic
disability, as well
as the degree of weakness in the left arm.</i>
<P>

<i>I believe her left knee situation will `hold up' indefinitely.</i>
<P>

<i>Her major problem relates to her right hindfoot, where she suffered gross
damage to the os calcis and sub-talar region and it was
most difficult to sort
out this problem, but in general, the situation has been improved significantly
by osteotomy and triple fusion
of the hindfoot.</i>
<P>

<i>I was quite pleased to see how well she walked in her boots today and I feel
that this situation will not alter significantly as the
years go by.</i>
<P>

<i>She now appears to be weight bearing on a plantar grade foot and there is no
evidence of any excess localised weight bearing under
the tread.  I feel that
this right foot and ankle will `hold up' for many years to come."</i>
<P>

87  	Other medical reports have been tendered in this case but I do
not understand there to be any medical issue and I am satisfied
to accept the
position is as stated by Dr Maloney.
<P>

88  	Dr Maloney gave evidence and was not challenged as to his
assessment of the plaintiff.
<P>

89  	So far as the plaintiff is concerned, her evidence is that her
condition has not changed over the last few years.
<P>

90  	The plaintiff said that at the present time she experiences a
lot of pain in both lower limbs by the end of the day.  The pain
is in the left
knee and in the right foot and pain is experienced in those areas if she has
been on her feet throughout the day.
 On days when she is at rest she does not
experience this pain.
<P>

91  	The plaintiff said that she is unable to wear high-heel shoes
and she is unable to walk barefoot.  She said that she wears
boots with inner
soles.  The plaintiff said that she is not as agile as she was and has
difficulty moving quickly.  She said that
her knee gives way on her on
occasions.  She said she is unable to run and when asked specifically about
this, the plaintiff said
that her condition has remained much the same since
1995.
<P>

92  	I accept that the plaintiff has these continuing complaints
which I have reviewed, and I am satisfied that these problems are
the
consequence of the injuries she sustained whilst working on the "Tagula
Bay".
<P>

93  	The plaintiff has scarring of the right foot, of the left knee
and, of course, in the left upper limb.  There is also scarring
in the hip
areas at the sites from which the donor bone was taken for the arthodesis
procedures.
<P>

94  	The plaintiff also makes complaint that since the accident she
has experienced pain in the area of the bridge of the nose,
radiating out to
the cheekbones, and the plaintiff said that she has been experiencing that pain
since the accident and she described
it in evidence as being <i>"like a half
migraine"</i>.  The plaintiff for this problem was referred to Dr Loane, an
ear, nose and throat surgeon, who reported that <i>"her x-rays showed an old
fracture of the nasal pyramid to the left of the midline with minimal
displacement."</i>  It was the doctor's opinion that the plaintiff had post
traumatic pain.  I am satisfied that the nose problems the plaintiff has
experienced resulted from her fall in this accident.
<P>

95  	The injuries which the plaintiff sustained were undoubtedly
severe and, although she has made a reasonably good recovery, the
plaintiff has
been left with significant ongoing problems, particularly in the left knee and
the right foot.  I consider it unlikely
that the plaintiff will improve any
further.
<P>

<b>The assessment of damages</b>
<P>

96  	The plaintiff impressed me as an honest and reliable witness and
having watched her closely I consider that the plaintiff did
not seek to
overstate the effect of this accident upon her.  I observed earlier that there
does not appear to have been any medical
issue in this case and the only doctor
who was called was Dr Maloney.  
<P>

97  	This plaintiff sustained what were serious injuries and she was
required to undergo a great deal of treatment, submitting to
a number of
operations which I have reviewed.
<P>

98  	The plaintiff has been left with disabilities and persisting
symptoms that I have identified.  The plaintiff will be required
to continue to
work and being on her feet throughout the day will continue to be productive of
symptoms as this activity has been
in the past.
<P>

99  	In all the circumstances, I consider that an allowance for the
non economic aspects of general damages of $80,000 is appropriate.
 I include
that sum in my assessment.
<P>

100  	That assessment attracts interests which I allow at two percent
on $40,000.  Rounding the calculation off, I allow interest
of $6200.
<P>

101  	A claim is made for the value of services provided by the
plaintiff's daughter.  This claim has been quantified at two hours
per day for
two years at a rate of $15 per hour.
<P>

102  	The evidence in point was meagre but unchallenged.  The
plaintiff said that for a period of <i>"a couple of years"</i> the plaintiff's
daughter helped her with housework and during the period that she was in
plaster the daughter also helped her to
shower.  The daughter gave assistance
with cooking also.  The plaintiff's estimate was that the services were
provided on average
by the daughter for two hours per day over the period of
two years.  That evidence was not challenged.  I note that the plaintiff
gave a
history to Dr Middleton that it was in about January 1994 that she was able to
walk without aids.  That history accords with
the plaintiff's evidence.
<P>

103  	The plaintiff's evidence does suffer from understandable
imprecision on this point.  There may well have been some tapering
off of the
need for assistance over that two year period but it seems to me on the balance
of probabilities that it is fair to allow
the sum of $20,000 for this claim.
<P>

104  	The plaintiff is entitled to interest on this sum, which I
allow in the sum of $8000, rounding my calculation off.
<P>

105  	Out of pocket expenses have been agreed in this matter in the
sum of $27,589.45.  That sum I include in my assessment.  I
do not understand
that there is any claim for interest for any part of that amount.
<P>

106  	So far as the future is concerned, I propose to make some
allowance for medical assessment and analgesics.  The plaintiff
did say that
since 1995 she has made forty to fifty visits to a doctor in Queensland where
she is now residing.  There was no report
from this doctor and the estimate of
the number of visits is the only feature of the plaintiff's evidence about
which I have some
reservations.  Nevertheless, the plaintiff will probably have
some need for medication in the future and there is the possibility
of further
surgery to which I shall refer when considering the plaintiff's claim for
future loss of earning capacity.  I propose
to make a modest allowance for
future medical and pharmaceutical expenses.  In doing so, I do not ignore the
content of Dr Bracken's
report of 1 August 1994 and his assessment therein
expressed concerning the costs associated with future surgery should the
plaintiff
come to this.  I allow for future medical and pharmaceutical costs
the sum of $4000.
<P>

107  	The plaintiff makes a claim for loss of earnings and for loss
of earning capacity.
<P>

108  	The plaintiff was born on 21 August 1954, so that she is
presently forty-five years of age.  The plaintiff left school at
the end of
form three.  After the plaintiff left school she found work in an office in
Dubbo but soon turned to manual work, taking
up employment at the Mudgee
Abattoirs.  Her next position was in a butcher's shop in the Illawarra
district.  The plaintiff married
at a young age in 1971 and has a grown-up
daughter.  The marriage did not last and the plaintiff was divorced many years
ago.
<P>

109  	Whilst the plaintiff was working in a butcher's shop she was
involved in the motor vehicle accident in which she fractured
her arm.  When
next she returned to employment, the plaintiff took up bar work and said that
she had no problem coping with it. 
The plaintiff worked at the RSL Club at
Figtree for eight years until 1988 but in the late `80s moved to Queensland
looking for work.
 The plaintiff found work at the Broadbeach Bowling Club,
doing bar work.
<P>

110  	Employment was not plentiful and it was in 1991 that the
plaintiff had the opportunity of first working on a fishing trawler,
taking up
employment as a deckhand and cook on the "Caladon Bay".  Her engagement on that
vessel took her to sea for three months.
 At the conclusion of that work the
plaintiff returned to Wollongong and it was when she was pursuing payment for
her services on
the "Caladon Bay" that she was offered a further opportunity of
work at sea, this time on the "Tagula Bay" and on the voyage in which
her
accident occurred.
<P>

111  	The plaintiff did not work again until 1995, although the
plaintiff said she was looking for work from 1993 onwards.  The
plaintiff did
undertake some retraining in Queensland and she said that over a period of six
months she endeavoured to learn new
skills but it would seem she was not
successful in this retraining and has not learnt to type.  She has been unable
to learn computer
skills.
<P>

112  	The plaintiff has however returned to work as a cleaner and the
hours that the plaintiff has worked since 1995 in this calling
have varied
depending upon availability of work.  Sometimes the plaintiff has worked as
often as six days per week  but on other
occasions work has been available for
only three days per week.  Hours of employment have been from 8.30 am to 4.30
pm and the nature
of the work requires the plaintiff to be on her feet all the
time, and the plaintiff said, and I accept, that when she does a full
day's
work this causes the complaints in the knee and the right foot which I have
reviewed earlier.
<P>

113  	Dr Maloney considered that the surgical procedures which he
undertook necessitated lengthy convalescence and he considered
it was
reasonable that the plaintiff was unable to work until 1995.  I accept that
assessment and it seems to me that it is appropriate
that the plaintiff should
be compensated for an inability to earn from the date of the accident until
early 1995.  Mr King submitted
that I should allow $250 per week for this
period and that seems to me to be reasonable.  Accordingly, I allow for loss of
earnings
for the three years immediately following this accident the sum of
$39,000.
<P>

114  	Although the plaintiff has been able to return to work as a
cleaner, I accept that full time bar work would be beyond her
and I also accept
that she would be unable to return to the sort of work she was doing on the
"Tagula Bay".
<P>

115  	Theoretically, clerical work and sedentary work would be within
the plaintiff's capacity but the plaintiff is not trained
for that sort of
work.
<P>

116  	The plaintiff, it seems to me, is limited to doing the sort of
work that she is presently undertaking.  Although being required
to stand
during a working day causes pain, worse by the end of the day, I accept that
the plaintiff is capable of working full time
as a cleaner.
<P>

117  	It seems to me that the plaintiff is to be regarded as at a
disadvantage on the open labour market by reason of her disabilities,
and that
she is incapable now of doing bar work.  The plaintiff would no longer be
capable of trawler work, but the evidence in this
case does not satisfy me that
trawler work is well paid, or that the plaintiff would have wanted to pursue
such work even if she
had not been injured.
<P>

118  	I am satisfied that, had she not been injured, the plaintiff
would have continued to work on a regular full time basis provided
work became
available but her pre-injury working history was not uninterrupted.  There were
times that the plaintiff was unable to
find work and, even if the plaintiff had
not been injured in January 1992, it is nevertheless likely that there would
have been interruptions
to her employment.  
<P>

119  	Exhibit N is a schedule which sets out in summary the
plaintiff's annual earnings commencing with the year ended 30 June 1983.
 What
the schedule shows since the plaintiff returned to work in 1995 is that the
plaintiff has been able to build up her earnings
over that period of three
years and Mr King has not sought to claim any actual loss of earnings since the
plaintiff resumed working
in 1995.  What I allow for the past then is the sum
of $39,000 I have earlier recorded.
<P>

120  	The plaintiff is entitled to interest on that sum, less the
value of benefits received in the period of three years to which
the sum
relates.  Hence I allow interest in the sum of $11,750, rounding my calculation
off.
<P>

121  	At the present time and in the foreseeable future, the
plaintiff appears to be capable of doing full time work as a cleaner
and there
is no ongoing economic loss.  Mr King does not submit otherwise but has
submitted that the plaintiff should be allowed
compensation in the nature of a
"buffer" allowance for the future.
<P>

122  	Two reports have been tendered from Dr Bracken who assessed the
plaintiff in August 1994 and again in April 1996.  It was
Dr Bracken's
assessment in August 1994 that the plaintiff was going to experience
osteoarthritic changes in the joint behind the
left kneecap and that she would
need a formal patellectomy by the time she reached the age of fifty.  Dr
Bracken considered that
there was no reason to change his opinion having seen
the plaintiff again in 1996.  Nevertheless, accepting as I do the opinions
expressed by Dr Maloney who treated this plaintiff, I do not consider it likely
that the plaintiff will require further operation
on the knee either at the age
of fifty or later.  Dr Maloney last saw the plaintiff on 23 April 1996, about
the same time as Dr Bracken
saw the plaintiff for the second time.  The
plaintiff says that her condition has remained about the same over the course
of the
last three years.  
<P>

123  	Whilst I do not regard it as probable that the plaintiff will
require further surgery, there is a chance, the prospects of
which I must
assess consistently with the decision in <i>Malec v J.C. Hutton Pty Limited</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20169%20CLR%20638" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 169 CLR 638.</a>
<P>

124  	Should the plaintiff require further surgery, or should her
knee deteriorate so as to further restrict her in the sort of
work she could
do, that would impact upon her loss of earning capacity.
<P>

125  	I take this factor into account and also the difficulties which
I have identified already that the plaintiff would have when
required to seek
work on the labour market.  The plaintiff is not as well placed as she would be
were she uninjured.  With these
considerations in mind, I propose to allow for
loss of earning capacity for the future the sum of $25,000.  In doing so, I am
mindful
of the fact that the plaintiff's economic circumstances are such that
she would be likely to want to work to the age of sixty-five
years.
<P>

126  	I summarise my assessment then as follows:
<P>

General damages (non economic aspects)	$80,000
<P>

Interest	6,200
<P>

Allowance for provision of necessary services	20,000
<P>

Interest	8,000
<P>

Out of pocket expenses	27,589.45
<P>

Provision for future medical and pharmaceutical expenses	4,000.00
<P>

Past economic loss	39,000.00
<P>

Interest	11,750.00
<P>

Allowance for future loss of earning capacity 	<u>25,000.00</u>
<P>

	$221,539.45
<P>

<b>The employment of the plaintiff</b>
<P>

127  	Earlier, in tracing the plaintiff's working history, I referred
to the plaintiff's engagement on the "Caladon Bay" and subsequently
on the
"Tagula Bay".  The plaintiff was offered the position on the "Caladon Bay"
through a friend, and she joined that vessel at
Darwin.  The plaintiff worked
on it for three months.  The plaintiff was paid by way of a percentage of the
catch and in the statements
accompanying the payments received, the payments
were expressed as coming from "B.A. La Macchia" (the first defendant).  
<P>

128  	After her work on the "Caladon Bay", the plaintiff returned to
Wollongong where, in the belief she was owed more than she
had been paid for
that work, she rang Mrs Keogh (then Miss Buckley) in Cairns.  Mrs Keogh gave
evidence that she was acting at that
time as the agent for shipping vessels.
As such, Mrs Keogh would perform a number of tasks, including finding crew for
vessels and
selling the catch.  When the plaintiff sought to be paid in full
for her work on the "Caladon Bay", Mrs Keogh offered the plaintiff
work on the
"Tagula Bay" and the plaintiff accepted the position, which was as cook and
deckhand.  Mrs Keogh arranged the plaintiff's
airfare and picked her up at
Cairns.
<P>

129  	Upon arrival in Cairns the plaintiff was introduced to the
fourth defendant and I am satisfied the plaintiff joined the "Tagula
Bay" in
the company of the fourth defendant.  However, I do not find him to be her
employer.
<P>

130  	There are no wage records nor payment records to identify the
plaintiff's employer, because in fact the plaintiff was paid
nothing for her
work on the "Tagula Bay", and it is necessary to consider the evidence of Mrs
Keogh and certain exhibits to determine
the plaintiff's status on the "Tagula
Bay".
<P>

131  	Mrs Keogh, whose evidence I accept, said that she was appointed
as agent for the "Tagula Bay" at a time when that vessel was
under receivership
and her appointment came from the receiver, William Easdown (the second
defendant).  Mrs Keogh understood that
the second defendant was the agent
appointed by the Commonwealth Bank, but it was her understanding that she had
to obtain authority
from the second defendant for whatever money she spent on
the "Tagula Bay".  In due course the arrangement was relaxed somewhat and
she
was able to spend up to $2000 without prior approval.  Mrs Keogh said that her
agency sold the catch from the "Tagula Bay" but
had to account for it to the
second defendant and would invoice the second defendant for the agency's
commission of twenty-five cents
in the kilo.
<P>

132  	Mr King submitted that I should find that the second defendant
was the employer of both the plaintiff and the fourth defendant
because their
remuneration was controlled by the second defendant as the receiver.  No monies
became available on the evidence of
Mrs Keogh until distributed by the second
defendant, so both the fourth defendant and the plaintiff were dependent upon
the receiver
to be paid.  According to Mrs Keogh, subject to the authority to
spend up to $2000 on a cheque account, the receiver's authority
was required
for all expenditure and the receiver had to be consulted before crew members
were engaged.  Mrs Keogh had to make a
regular report to the receiver.  So it
is, Mr King submitted, that I should find that the critical criterion of
control over both
the plaintiff and the fourth defendant pointed to the second
defendant as their employer.
<P>

133  	I do not consider this to be the case.  In considering this
submission I have had regard to the evidence given by Mr Beazley,
an accountant
with Price Waterhouse, who worked with the second defendant and who had an
active role in the discharge of the receiver's
duties concerning the "Tagula
Bay".  Mr Beazley said that the receiver made available to the third defendant
the funds from which
the crew was to be paid.  Their remuneration was, he
confirmed, a percentage of the catch and what Texole was paid by the second
defendant was twenty-five percent of the catch.  Mr Beazley said that he had no
knowledge of fishing and sought guidance, mainly
from Mrs Keogh.  He said that
the second defendant had no interest whatever in the crew because they were not
employees of the receiver.
 He was not aware of the split up of commissions to
go to the crew and a decision in that regard was for the third defendant.
<P>

134  	Mrs Keogh was aware that Texole Pty Limited, the third
defendant, had been appointed by the receiver to operate the vessel.
 
<P>

135  	Mrs Keogh said it was common practice in her experience that
crew on shipping vessels were paid a share of the catch.  
<P>

136  	I now turn to consider a number of exhibits:
<P>

(i)	Exhibit H is a deed of mortgage between the first defendant and the
Commonwealth Bank, which deed was expressed to secure advances.
 The security
was identified as <i>"64 shares in the ship known as Tagula Bay..."</i>.  The
deed provided in part:
<P>

<i>"2.  At any time after the moneys hereby secured become payable or after
this mortgage shall have become enforceable the Bank or an
authorised officer
of the Bank may appoint in writing any person to be a receiver of the mortgaged
premises or any part thereof and
may remove any such receiver and in case of
the removal retirement or death of any such receiver may appoint another in his
place
and may fix the remuneration of any such receiver at such amount or at
such rate as the Bank shall think fit PROVIDED ALWAYS that
every such receiver
shall be the agent of the Mortgagor and the Mortgagor alone shall be
responsible for his acts and defaults and
such receiver so appointed shall
without any consent on the part of the Mortgagor have power:-</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	to enter upon and take possession and/or to enter into receipt of the
rents and profits of all or any of the mortgaged premises
and to employ the
same in any trade and to manage the same and to rebuild alter and add and to do
all such things as the Bank may
deem necessary to manage and efficiently carry
on the mortgaged premises or to obtain income therefrom and for any of such
purposes
to employ managers workmen and others and otherwise to act in all
respects as the Bank in its absolute discretion may think fit..."</i>
<P>

(ii)	Exhibit J evidences that on 7 January 1991 the bank exercised its power
under the deed of mortgage to appoint a receiver and
the second defendant was
appointed as the receiver.
<P>

(iii)	Exhibit K is an agreement entered into by the second defendant
(identified in the agreement as the "Operator") and the third
defendant
(identified in the agreement as the "Skipper").  This agreement recited that
the second defendant had been appointed as
the receiver and manager of the
"Tagula Bay" and that it had agreed to employ the third defendant to fish the
vehicle on the terms
set out in the agreement.  One provision of the agreement
was that the third defendant would 
<P>

<i>"engage as contractors or share fishermen all necessary fishermen for the
efficient and lawful operation at all times of the vessel
and to attend to
payment of such fishermen from the skipper's share of the proceeds of the
catch":  </i>cl 3(b)
<P>

137  	Mr Longhurst, who appeared for the first and third defendants,
called no evidence concerning the role of either defendant
and evidence
introduced by Mr Longhurst was documentary only.  
<P>

138  	Whilst the evidence in point is meagre, I am persuaded on the
balance of probabilities that the plaintiff was employed by
the third
defendant.  Although the plaintiff was to be paid by receipt of a share of the
catch, the meagre evidence does satisfy
me that her status was that of an
employee rather than that of an independent contractor.  To the extent that
there was scope for
it, there was control, not only of the duties the plaintiff
was to perform but of the way in which she performed those duties, and
that
control was exercised through the fourth defendant as the skipper of the
vessel.
<P>

139  	The fourth defendant was no more fortunate than the plaintiff
in being paid for his work on the "Tagula Bay".  He received
nothing but I am
satisfied that his services were engaged as the skipper of the "Tagula Bay" by
Miss Buckley and that like the plaintiff
he was employed as skipper by the
third defendant.  
<P>

140  	Evidence was introduced in documentary form from Mr Downing, an
accountant practising in Nambour in Queensland (Exhibit 7).
 Mr Downing is the
fourth defendant's stepfather and acted as the fourth defendant's accountant
for a period of approximately fifteen
years during which time he prepared the
fourth defendant's taxation returns.  Mr Downing stated in Exhibit 7:
<P>

<i>4.	"I can say that all of the income which was included in the income tax
returns of the Fourth Defendant in the financial years ended
1981 to 1996 was
earned as an employee and that none of the income was earned as an independent
contractor.  I can say this because
all of the income included in those tax
returns had corresponding group certificates issued to the Fourth Defendant by
each of his
employers.</i>
<P>

<i>5.	I have acted for many fisherman [sic] and, in particular, a number of
skippers of fishing vessels in Queensland over my years of
practice.  In my
experience it is usual for fishermen and skippers of fishing vessels in
Queensland to be engaged as employees and
to be paid wages with PAYE tax
deducted.  Those wages are often calculated based on a percentage of the catch
or of the net catch.
 It is not, in my experience, common for fisherman [sic]
and skippers of fishing vessels in Queensland to be engaged as independent
contractors."</i>
<P>

141  	The above evidence of Mr Downing was unchallenged and I am
influenced by it in finding that both the plaintiff and the fourth
defendant
were at all relevant times employed by the third defendant.
<P>

<b>The liability of the defendants to the plaintiff</b>
<P>

142  	I find that in operating the winch on the occasion on which the
plaintiff was injured, the fourth defendant was acting in
the course of his
employment with the third defendant and I am satisfied on the balance of
probabilities that the third defendant
is vicariously liable for the negligence
of the fourth defendant such as I have earlier described.  
<P>

143  	Mr Stevens submitted that even if I were to find, as I have
indeed found, that the fourth defendant was negligent, the plaintiff
should
nevertheless fail against him.  Put shortly, Mr Stevens' submission is that
under s 11 of the <i>Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross Vesting) Act</i> I should
apply the law of New South Wales and part of the law of New South Wales is the
New South Wales statute known as the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ela1991217/" class="autolink_findacts">Employees Liability Act</a></i>, 1991.  Mr
Stevens submitted that under that Act once the employer of the fourth defendant
was identified the fourth defendant was
not liable in damages.  Alternatively,
Mr Stevens submitted that the fourth defendant was entitled to be indemnified
by the third
defendant in respect of any liability to the plaintiff.
<P>

144  	The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ela1991217/" class="autolink_findacts">Employees Liability Act</i> 1991</a> repealed the
<i>Employee's Liability (Indemnification of Employer) Act</i> 1982, and was
given retrospective effect by s 9:
<P>

<i>"This Act applies whether the cause of action concerned arose before, or
arises after, the commencement of this section."</i>
<P>

145  	The statute affords protection for a negligent employee, by
extending to him a right of indemnity against his employer.  Section
3
provides:
<P>

<i>"(1)  	If an employee commits a tort for which his or her employer is also
liable: </i>
<P>

<i>(a) 	the employee is not liable to indemnify, or to pay any contribution to,
the employer in respect of the liability incurred by
the employer; and </i>
<P>

<i>(b)  	the employer is liable to indemnify the employee in respect of
liability incurred by the employee for the tort (unless the employee
is
otherwise entitled to an indemnity in respect of that liability). </i>
<P>

<i>(2) 	Contribution under this section includes contribution as joint
tortfeasor or otherwise."</i>
<P>

146  	It is to be observed that, where applicable, the section does
not provide a negligent employee with a defence to a claim brought
by a person
injured as a result of his negligence.  What the section does is to provide a
negligent employee with a defence to a
claim for indemnity that might otherwise
have been made by his employer, and further it provides that employee with a
right of indemnity
against his employer in respect of liability to the person
injured because of the employee's negligence.
<P>

147  	Assuming for the moment its application in this case, the
submission that the statute defeats the plaintiff's claim against
the fourth
defendant must be rejected.  The statute does not shield a negligent employee
against a liability for his negligence should
a person injured by reason
thereof choose to sue him.
<P>

148  	It follows from the findings I have made that the plaintiff is
entitled to a verdict and to judgment against both the third
defendant and the
fourth defendant.
<P>

149  	No negligence has been established in the plaintiff's case
against either the first defendant or the second defendant.  On
the findings I
have made the only negligence that the plaintiff has proved is the casual act
of negligence by the fourth defendant,
and neither the first defendant nor the
second defendant is vicariously liable for such negligence.  In the result, the
plaintiff
fails against these defendants and both the first defendant and the
second defendant are entitled to judgment in their favour on
the plaintiff's
claims.
<P>

<b>The various cross claims</b>
<P>

150  	There have been a number of cross claims filed between the
parties to this cause.  The third defendant has pursued a claim
against the
second defendant based upon a breach of an alleged contractual obligation to
insure.  The second defendant has filed
a cross claim against the third
defendant.  When the hearing concluded in Wollongong on 6 August last Mr
Mescher made an application
to defer the completion of the hearing in respect
of the cross claims between the second and third defendants, indicating that he
may wish to reopen to introduce evidence against the third defendant bearing
upon the cross claims between these two parties.  That
application was acceded
to and the matter was adjourned to 23 August.  On that date a further
adjournment application was made in
respect of those cross claims and the
matter came back before this Court on 16 September.  The Court was then
informed that further
short evidence in documentary form would be sought to be
introduced on these cross claims and the matter has been listed for hearing
in
respect of those cross claims only on 11 October 1999.
<P>

151  	The outcome of those cross claims cannot however affect the
outcome of the proceedings between the plaintiff and the defendants
nor the
proceedings on the remaining cross claims.
<P>

152  	The second defendant has filed a cross claim against the fourth
defendant claiming relief pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(1)(c)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act</i> 1946</a>.  In that cross claim, the second
defendant seeks indemnity or contribution in respect of any liability found to
exist towards the
plaintiff.  Since the plaintiff has failed against the second
defendant it follows that this cross claim must fail and that the fourth
defendant is entitled to judgment on this cross claim.
<P>

153  	The remaining cross claim is a claim brought by the fourth
defendant against the first defendant, the second defendant and
the third
defendant.  The claim against each of these defendants by way of cross claim is
one for indemnity or contribution towards
any verdict recovered against the
fourth defendant by the plaintiff.
<P>

154  	The fourth defendant bases his cross claim against each of the
cross defendants identified in negligence, identifying the
negligence as
follows:
<P>

<i>"(a)	failure to provide any, or any adequate, proper professional and/or
effective equipment for the operation of scallop trawling
nets on the vessel
`Tagula Bay';</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	failure to ensure that the plaintiff was a fully and properly trained
deckhand with experience in scallop fishing and the operation
of net lines from
the vessel used in the said operation;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	failure to erect any or any adequate signs on the said vessel warning
the plaintiff of the possibility of the recoil of the said
rope;</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	failure to warn or properly warn the plaintiff of the dangers involved
in scallop trawling in the circumstances."</i>
<P>

155  	The fourth defendant has failed to prove any of the above
assertions of negligence against any of the cross defendants.  Particular
(a)
relates to the failure to equip the trawler with a free riding bar to minimise
the risk of back-feeding of the lazy line and
the failure to install an A frame
on the vessel for use in conjunction with the operation of the winches.  As I
have earlier indicated,
I am not satisfied that the failure to afford either
one of these devices was negligent.
<P>

156  	As to the remaining particulars of negligence in this cross
claim, I am not satisfied that any of these heads of negligence
have been
proved.  Even assuming that they had been, I would not be satisfied that any
one of them was causative of the accident,
which I have found to be due simply
to the casual act of negligence of the fourth defendant.
<P>

157  	It follows that the first defendant and the second defendant
are each entitled to judgment on the fourth defendant's cross
claim against
them.
<P>

158  	So far as the cross claim against the third defendant is
concerned, in his written submissions to which I earlier made reference
in para
143, Mr Stevens submitted that the fourth defendant had a statutory right of
indemnity against the third defendant, but that
has not been pleaded, and Mr
Longhurst has not addressed any submission to the cross claim as asserted on
that basis.
<P>

159  	In the circumstances I will defer my decision on the fourth
defendant's cross claim against the third defendant so as to afford
to the
fourth defendant an opportunity to apply to amend his cross claim against the
third defendant should he decide to do so, and
to hear any submissions Mr
Longhurst may care to make as to why an amendment should not be granted.  If
the pleading is amended,
then the fourth defendant and the third defendant must
be given the opportunity of making submissions as to whether or not any
statutory
right of indemnity is available to the fourth defendant when the
subject accident occurred in Queensland.
<P>

160  	Since the cross claims as between the second and the third
defendants and the fourth defendant and the third defendant, the
hearing of
which are yet to be finalised, can have no bearing on the outcome of the
plaintiff's claim against the defendants and
the remaining cross claims I have
identified, I propose to give judgment on the claims and cross claims that have
been determined
without further delay.
<P>

<b>Judgments and orders</b>
<P>

161  	(1)	On the plaintiff's claim against the first defendant,
verdict and judgment
<P>

 for the first defendant.
<P>

(2)	On the plaintiff's claim against the second defendant, verdict and judgment
for the second defendant.
<P>

(3)	On the plaintiff's claim against the third and fourth defendants, verdict
and judgment for the plaintiff against each of these
defendants in the sum of
$221,539.45.
<P>

(4)	On the second defendant's cross claim against the fourth defendant,
judgment for the fourth defendant.
<P>

(5)	On the fourth defendant's cross claims against the first and second
defendants, judgments for each of those cross defendants.
<P>

(6)	On the cross claims as between the second and third defendants, I make no
further order pending the further hearing in respect
of those cross claims on
11 October 1999.
<P>

(7)	On the cross claim by the fourth defendant against the third defendant, I
direct that that cross claim be listed for mention
on 30 September 1999.
<P>

(8)	I reserve all questions of costs on the various claims made by the
plaintiff and on the various cross claims so as to afford
to the parties the
opportunity of making submissions as to those costs after consideration of my
judgment now published.
<P>
