<b>3820/98	DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE
STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES ON BEHALF OF THE VICTIMS' COMPENSATION
FUND
CORPORATION   -v-   ANTHONY GEORGE REID &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:   </b>There is presently before the Court a
notice of motion filed by the defendants, Anthony George Reid and Michael Reid,
on 23 March
1999.  By that notice of motion the defendants seek, firstly, an
order that the present proceedings be stayed. In paragraph 1 it
is described as
an order that the proceedings be stood over pending the determination of
certain objections either already raised
or to be raised by the defendants in
relation to restitution orders made by the Victims' Compensation Tribunal
against the first
defendant.  
<P>

2   	Other items of relief are sought in the notice of motion.
However it was the view of the Counsel for the respective parties
that it was
appropriate that I should deal firstly with the foregoing application in
paragraph 1 of the notice of motion; since,
if the applicants, are successful
in obtaining such a stay of the substantive proceedings, then the various
further procedural orders
sought in the remaining paragraphs of the notice of
motion will at that stage be unnecessary.  
<P>

3   	It is appropriate that I should set forth, at least in
summary, the background to the present application.  In May 1997 the
first
defendant was convicted of seven child-related sexual offences.  On 23 June
1997 the first defendant transferred to the second
defendant certain real
property. In October 1997 the first defendant was convicted of further
offences.  Applications by the victims
of those offences have been made for
compensation pursuant to the provisions of the <i>Victims Compensation Act
</i>1996. There have already been made a number of awards of compensation in
favour of some of those victims.  Other such applications
for compensation are
pending.  
<P>

4   	The plaintiff, the Director-General of the Department of
the Attorney General of the State of New South Wales on behalf of
the Victims'
Compensation Fund Corporation, brings the present proceedings pursuant to the
provisions of section 37A of the <i>Conveyancing Act, </i>whereby he seeks to
set aside what is asserted to be a fraudulent transfer of property.  
<P>

5   	The reason why the proceedings have been instituted is that
there has already been made a number of what are described as restitution
orders, that is, orders made against the first defendant requiring him to pay
to the Victims' Compensation Fund the amounts necessary
to reimburse that
statutory fund in respect of the awards of compensation that have been made to
the victims.
<P>

6   	For the purpose of the present application it is
unnecessary for me to set forth the details of the statutory provisions
relating
to the making of the restitution orders.  However the procedure
relating to those orders is set forth in the notices which have already
been
served by the Victims' Compensation Tribunal upon the first defendant.
<P>

7   	There have already been made provisional orders for
restitution in a number of instances against the first defendant.  He has
an
entitlement to appeal against those orders by way of raising objections.  He
has already done that in a number of instances. 
It is contemplated that there
will be a total of ten restitution orders sought to be made against the first
defendant.
<P>

8   	The substantive proceedings were instituted by statement of
claim which was filed by the plaintiff on 4 September 1998.  By
paragraph 12 of
that statement of claim it is asserted that the transfer of the subject
property from the first defendant to the
second defendant was an alienation of
property made with intent to defraud creditors within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s37a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 37A</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act </i>1919</a>.  Particulars are appended to that paragraph;
those particulars being firstly that the transfer was for nominal consideration
or
alternatively for no consideration, and, secondly, that the first defendant
transferred the property to prevent the victims of the
offences and/or the
plaintiff recovering money from him in relation to the offences.
<P>

9   	Counsel for the plaintiff has informed the Court that,
according to his instructions, it is not presently known when the further
claims for restitution against the first defendant will be determined or when
the first defendant's objections to those restitution
orders will be
determined. The applicant defendants submit that the appeals of the first
defendant against the restitution orders
already made or against any future
restitution orders which might be made may be entirely successful, with the
consequence that no
moneys are payable by the first defendant to the plaintiff.
It is submitted on behalf of the defendants that it would be inappropriate
for
the Court  at this stage to attempt to pre-empt the outcome of that appeal
process.  
<P>

10   	Further, it is submitted on behalf of the defendants that
it is possible that after the appeals are heard they may reach agreement
with
the plaintiff concerning the payment of moneys or the amount of such payment
under the restitution orders. Section 50(2) of
the <i>Victims Compensation Act
</i>contemplates that such an arrangement made be made.  It is submitted that
if there is an agreement reached between the first defendant
and the plaintiff,
then the plaintiff will no longer be a creditor of the first defendant and that
if he is not a creditor, then
there will be no utility in him pursuing the
present proceedings. Indeed there would be very considerable doubt as to
whether legally
he would be entitled to do so. The evidence discloses that the
present plaintiff has expressly informed the defendants that these
proceedings
are brought by him only in his statutory capacity on behalf of the Victims'
Compensation Fund Corporation and not on
behalf of any other person or entity.

<P>

11   	It is further submitted on behalf of the defendants that
there is considerable prejudice to the defendants (and in particular
to the
first defendant) in having the present claim of the plaintiff proceed
concurrently with the appeals which the first defendant
has already made or
which he proposes to make in respect to any further restitution orders.  
<P>

12   	It will be appreciated that the first defendant is in
custody.  He is serving his sentence in the Goulburn Gaol, and it is
submitted
on behalf of the defendants that there may be difficulty in obtaining
instructions from the first defendant in regard not
only to the present
proceedings but also to any appeals against the restitution orders.
<P>

13   	The plaintiff opposes any such stay or postponement of the
present proceedings.  He submits that he has an entitlement to
seek to have
property which has been alienated from the first defendant in the circumstances
contemplated by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s37a.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 37A</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a> </i>restored to the
first defendant so that it can be available to meet the legitimate claims of
creditors, not only the present creditors
but future creditors.  
<P>

14   	The plaintiff points to the fact that already provisional
orders for restitution have been made in three of the ten matters
in respect of
which the first defendant has been convicted, and (as I understand it) it is
submitted that the likelihood of restitution
orders being made in the remaining
matters is strong.  The plaintiff submits that there is little likelihood of
all the restitution
orders being set aside on appeal.  Indeed, as I understand
it, it is submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that there is little likelihood
of any of them being set aside on appeal. The plaintiff has submitted that
there is a duty in the plaintiff, who brings proceedings
such as the present in
an official capacity representing a statutory fund, to bring the proceedings
promptly, so that he cannot be
charged with what, in analogous civil
proceedings, might be described as laches.  
<P>

15   	That is quite so, and it seems to me that there can be no
criticism of the plaintiff in having instituted the proceedings
when he did and
having sought an injunction against the defendants from disposing of the
subject property or mortgaging, charging
or otherwise encumbering or dealing
with the property. But there was made on 4 September 1998, that being the very
day of the filing
of the statement of claim, an injunction as sought by the
plaintiff. That injunction was made by consent.  It has from time to time
been
extended, and is presently continuing in force without any opposition from the
defendants.
<P>

16   	It seems to me that, on the ground of prejudice, there
would be no prejudice to the plaintiff but there would be considerable
prejudice to the defendants (especially to the first defendant) if the present
proceedings were allowed to continue to progress in
a normal fashion until the
outcome of the first defendant's appeals against the restitution orders is
known.  Once that appeal process
has been completed, then it will be known not
only whether the first defendant is liable to make restitution but also the
total amount
of the restitution which he is liable to make to the statutory
fund.  
<P>

17   	I am not unmindful of the prejudice and the practical
disadvantages to the first defendant in conducting his appeals against
the
restitution orders concurrently with defending the present proceedings whilst
he is in custody and whilst his communication with
his legal representatives is
thereby not as unfettered as it might otherwise be. 
<P>

18   	Quite apart from the respective prejudice to the parties,
it seems to me that it is essential that the first defendant be
allowed to
exercise his rights of appeal and that those appeal processes be determined
before the present proceedings can advance.
  As I have already recorded, it
was the submission of the defendants that the Court should not at this stage in
the present proceedings
pre-empt the outcome of the appeal process.  I am in
agreement with that submission.  It is all very well for the plaintiff to say
that the likelihood of the appeals being successful is not great.  That may or
may not be so. But where the first defendant has a
statutory right of appeal
against the restitution orders that are made, he should be allowed to exercise
that right before the present
proceedings (which are grounded solely upon the
existence of enforceable restitution orders in favour of the plaintiff) are
allowed
to proceed.  
<P>

19   	Accordingly, it seems to me that it is appropriate in all
the circumstances of this case that the Court should make an order
which will
have the effect of either staying or postponing the progress of the present
proceedings, such order being of the nature
of that sought in paragraph 1 of
the notice of motion filed by the defendants on 23 March 1999.  I propose to
make such an order.
 In those circumstances it is unnecessary for me at this
stage to deal with any of the other items of relief which are sought in
that
notice of motion.
<P>

(At this stage the parties by consent agreed to bring in short minutes of order
in relation to the foregoing judgment, and the Court
heard submissions on
costs.)
<P>

20   	Counsel for the respective parties propose to attempt to
agree on an appropriate order to give effect to the conclusions expressed
in my
reasons for judgment which I have just delivered.  
<P>

21   	I have heard submissions concerning costs.  In my view the
applicant defendants are entitled to have the costs of the application
paid by
the plaintiff. Those costs will be the costs of to-day's hearing and the costs
of the application in similar form which was
returnable on 15 March 1999 and
was adjourned to 29 March 1999.
<P>

22   	I propose also to grant leave to the defendants to proceed
forthwith to assessment of those costs.
<P>

23   	The balance of the notice of motion will be stood over
generally, with liberty to either party to restore on seven days' notice.
I
would appreciate if Counsel were able to prepare short minutes incorporating
those orders which I have indicated. I will stand
the matter down for that
purpose.
<P>

24   	SMARK:  Your Honour, I may have misled you in something
that I said.  You asked me a question about the progress of the appeals
and of
the application.  I said that there was nothing I could tell you about that.
You said in your judgment some things about the
progress.  I was not attempting
to be tricky but there was nothing I could tell you.  That was not meant to
mean any particular state
of facts.  As I said, I told you nothing.
<P>

25   	<b>MASTER</b>:  Yes.  I have noted down that it is not
known when the further matters will be determined or when the objections will
be heard.
<P>

26   	SMARK:  I did not say that.  I intentionally did not and I
am sorry if I misled you.  I had no intention of doing so.  I did
not wish to
convey that proposition.
<P>

27   	<b>MASTER</b>:  Well what was it that you wished to convey
Mr Smark because I have obviously written down something that you did not wish
to convey.
 Would you tell me what you did wish to convey.
<P>

28   	SMARK: There was nothing that I could tell you about the
matter.
<P>

29   	<b>MASTER</b>: But I think you said something before
that.
<P>

30   	SMARK:  If I said something further then I apologise
because all I wished to say was there was nothing I could tell you about
the
matter.  You did specifically raise it so I did respond to it.
<P>

31   	<b>MASTER</b>: Yes, and you sought instructions.
<P>

32   	SMARK:  Yes.
<P>

33   	<b>MASTER</b>:  I will have it noted that Mr Smark has
stated after the delivery of my foregoing reasons for judgment that the
statement which
I attributed to him in my reasons for judgment was not correct
and that what he informed me, in response to an inquiry made by me
as to when
the further matters would be determined or when the first defendant's
objections to the restitution orders would be determined
was that there was
nothing he could tell me about that matter.
<P>

34   	SMARK: Thank you Master. I am sorry if I misled you.
<P>

35   	<b>MASTER</b>:  Not at all.
<P>

36   	That statement by Mr Smark which he has just made to
correct what he perceived as an inaccuracy in my judgment does not alter
my
views concerning the substantive matters upon which I relied to reach the
conclusions expressed in the judgment.  
<P>

37   	I will stand the matters down for some convenient time.
<P>

38   	AT A LATER STAGE
<P>

39   	MASTER: I will make the following orders: -
<P>

1.	I order that the proceedings be stayed up to and including twenty-eight days
after the determination of objections raised or
to be raised in appeals in
relation to restitution orders made by the Victim's Compensation Tribunal
against the first defendant
arising out of the convictions the May and October
1997.
<P>

2.	I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the defendants of today's
hearing and of the application returnable on 15 March 1999
and adjourned to 29
March 1999.
<P>

3.	I grant leave to the defendants to proceed forthwith to assessment of the
foregoing costs.
<P>

4.	I direct that the balance of the notice of motion filed by the defendants on
23 March 1999 be stood over generally, with liberty
to restore on seven days
notice.
