<b>1039/97 - ASSOCIATED FOOD TECHNOLOGY PTY LIMITED &amp; ORS  V  ROBERT MERVYN
BAXTER &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Ex tempore)</b>
<P>

(On application by the plaintiffs for leave to amend the statement of claim)
<P>

1	This is a judgment on an application by the plaintiffs for leave to amend
their statement of claim to insert a new paragraph 29A
together with
particulars of the material pleaded in that paragraph, a new paragraph 112A and
new prayers for relief by way of declarations
numbered 8A to 8C inclusive.
<P>

2	I do not propose to make any decision now with respect to paragraphs 8B and
C.  I have indicated to counsel for the plaintiffs
that there seems to me to be
a difficulty with respect to the introduction of these prayers for relief, when
so far as I can see
the material facts pleaded in the statement of claim do not
support that relief.  Counsel for the plaintiff has indicated that he
will
consider the position and I have granted him leave to raise the matter again at
the beginning of tomorrow morning's hearing.

<P>

3	So far as paragraph 8A is concerned, there is no objection to the amendment
and I propose, whatever else happens, to allow an
amendment to the statement of
claim to introduce that paragraph.  The principal issue for contention relates
to paragraph 29A. 
<P>

4	The application for leave to amend the statement of claim was foreshadowed
yesterday, the first day of the hearing, and was orally
made this morning.  I
set out the two paragraphs which the plaintiffs propose to insert in the
statement of claim:
<P>

	`29A(a) From about March 1992 until 20 October 1992 ATS, Abroron, Rockbid and
Kokab dealt with each other on the assumption that
ABC had been substituted for
ATS as the vehicle for Strong's interest in the Joint Venture.
<P>

(b) 	After ATS was deregistered on 20 October 1992 Strong, Abroron, Rockbid and
Kokab dealt with each other on that same assumption.
<P>

(c) 	After Abroron was terminated as a Joint Venturer in May 1993 Strong,
Rockbid and Kokab continued to deal with each other on
the same assumption
until ABC was terminated as a Joint Venturer on 30 June 1995.
<P>

(d) 	That assumption formed the conventional and accepted basis which governed
the relations between the Joint Venturers during
those periods respectively.
<P>

(e) 	It would be unjust or unconscionable if ATS resiled from that convention
and ATS is accordingly estopped from denying that
ABC was substituted for ATS
as a Joint Venturer from about March 1992 to 30 June 1995 and that the
termination of ABC's rights as
a Joint Venturer on the latter date was
effective to prevent any subsequent assertion by ATS of any entitlement to be a
Joint Venturer.
<P>

	Particulars of dealings between the joint venturers
<P>

(i) 	At a meeting of the directors AFT on 17 March 1992 it was agreed that if
the Joint Venture were to be restructured as an incorporated
joint venture,
shares representing Strong's 40 per cent interest would be issued to ABC or
other company nominated by Strong.
<P>

(ii) 	By an agreement between Merck, AFT, ABC, Rockbid, Kokab, Strong and Dairy
Farmers dated 22 September 1994 it was recited that
AFT had entered into a
joint venture agreement with ABC, Rockbid and Kokab and now held certain
intellectual property rights on trust
for the Joint Venturers, which term was
defined to mean AFT, ACT, Kokab and Rockbid.
<P>

(iii) 	In negotiations which were occasioned by the winding up proceedings
brought against AFT by Abroron and in which Conserv was
seeking to be
substituted as plaintiff, which negotiations were conducted variously between
the Joint Venturers and Campbell, Baxter
and Pickwell it was assumed that ABC
and not ATS was a Joint Venture member.
<P>

(iv) 	At a meeting of the Joint Venturers held on 31 March 1995 for the purpose
of changing the nominee from AFT to AFI, ABC was
present by its attorney Ms
Petterson and no person purported to represent ATS, and an agreement executed
for the same purpose on
the same date describes ABC as a Joint Venturer and is
executed by an attorney for ABC.
<P>

	112A If contrary to the matter pleaded in paragraph 29 above, ATS continued to
be a Joint Venturer until its de-registration on
20 October 1992 and such
rights and obligations as a Joint Venturer revested in it upon its
re-registration on 29 August 1995, Rockbid
terminated, as it was entitled to
do, the rights of ATS to participate further in the Joint Venture by a notice
dated 23 December
1995 issued under clause 11.3 of the First Joint Venture
Agreement.'
<P>

5	Paragraph 29A pleads to a cause of action in estoppel by convention.  This is
a relatively unsettled branch of the law, particularly
since the decision of
the English Court of Appeal in <i>Amalgamated Investment &amp; Property Co
Limited v The Texas Commerce International Bank Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20QB%2084" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1 QB 84.</a>
Prior to that decision estoppel by convention was seen as a limited form of
common law estoppel generally thought to have been encapsulated
in the
following passage in <i>Spencer Bower &amp; Turner on Estoppel by
Representation</i> (3rd Ed 1977) page 157:
<P>

	`This form of estoppel is founded, not on a representation of fact made by a
representor and believed by a representee, but on
an agreed statement of facts
the truth of which has been assumed, by the convention of the parties, as the
basis of a transaction
into which they are about to enter.  When the parties
have acted in their transaction upon the agreed assumption that a given state
of facts is to be accepted between them as true, then as regards that
transaction each will be estopped against the other from questioning
the truth
of the statement of facts so assumed.'
<P>

6	The <i>Texas Commerce</i> case extended the scope of this form of estoppel,
though the exact effect of that decision (especially when assessed in light of
the subsequent High Court decisions in <i>Legione v Hatley</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/11.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 11</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20152%20CLR%20406" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 152 CLR
406</a>; <i>Waltons Stores (Interstate) Limited v Maher</i><b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20164%20CLR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 164 CLR
387</a> and <i>Commonwealth v Verwayen</i> (1990) 170 CLR 394) is open to debate.
Evidently it is at least true that an estoppel may arise out of
post-contractual conduct rather
than anything occurring before the relevant
contract is made;  and it may arise by virtue of the conduct of a relationship
on the
basis of assumptions about the effect of a prior contract, rather than
out of anything as specific as an agreed statement of assumed
facts.  Thus
in<i> Hamel-Smith v Pycroft &amp; Jetsave Limited</i> (Unreported 5 February
1987) in a passage later endorsed by Bingham LJ in<b> </b><i>Vistafjord</i><b>
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20343" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 2 Lloyds Rep 343</a> at 352, Peter Gibson J said that the estoppel
applies where:
<P>

	1)  parties have established by their construction of their agreement or their
apprehension of its legal effect a conventional
basis;
<P>

	2)  on that basis they have regulated their subsequent dealings;  and
<P>

	3)  it would be unjust or unconscionable if one of the parties resiled from
that convention.
<P>

7	Similarly, in a partial formulation which is relevant here, the High Court of
Australia said in <i>Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich
Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20160%20CLR%20226" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 160 CLR 226</a>, 244 that
estoppel by convention is `a form of estoppel founded not on a representation
of fact made by a representor and acted on
by a representee to his detriment,
but on the conduct of relations between the parties on the basis of an agreed
or assumed set of
facts, which both will be estopped from denying.'
<P>

8	Fortunately it is not necessary for me to decide the precise scope and
content of estoppel by convention or its relationship with
estoppel by
representation or equitable estoppel generally.  In its wider formulations
estoppel by convention could be taken to undermine
the law of rectification and
even the law of contractual offer and acceptance, but its limiting principles
are fluid to say the least.
 
<P>

9	The issue for me relates to the plaintiffs' proposed pleading in paragraph
29A.  In the pleading context, a party is entitled
to assert a cause of action
which is not clearly established by the law, or even an entirely novel cause of
action as long as the
pleading satisfies the basic requirement of procedural
fairness that the pleading must state with sufficient clarity the case which
must be met.  So long as the pleading does that, the opposing party is
protected by its right to question the legal basis of the
pleading by motion in
the nature of demurrer.
<P>

10	Plainly the proposed paragraph 29A has been drafted with a view to the
modern doctrine of estoppel by convention as formulated
in the ways indicated
above.  The defendants say that as a pleading paragraph 29A and the
accompanying particulars are deficient.
 The defendants begin by referring to
the following basic propositions with respect to proper pleadings:
<P>

	1)  A pleading of a party shall contain and contain only a statement in a
summary form of the material facts on which he relies
but not the evidence by
which those facts are to be proved:  Supreme Court Rules, Part 15 rule 7(1).
<P>

	2)  The material facts are those facts necessary for the purpose of
formulating a complete cause of action: <i>Multi Group Distribution Services
Pty Limited v TNT Australia Pty Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1996/1758.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] FCA 1758</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%20ATPR%2041%2c522" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] ATPR 41,522</a> at 42,679.
<P>

	3)  It is not sufficient that the statement of claim simply expresses a
conclusion drawn from facts which are not stated:  <i>Multi Group
Distribution</i> at 42,679.
<P>

	4)  A party is required to plead facts rather than their legal effect:
<i>Ritchie's Supreme Court Procedure</i> (Looseleaf), paragraph 125(7)(ii). 
<P>

	5)  Not only must all material facts be pleaded but they must be pleaded with
a sufficient degree of specificity to convey to the
opposite party the case
which that party has to meet:  <i>Multi Group Distribution</i> at 42,679.
<P>

	6)  It is not a function of particulars to take the place of the necessary
averments in the statement of claim:  <i>Multi Group Distribution</i> at
42,679.
<P>

	7)  The requirement to plead facts is not satisfied merely by referring to the
existence of documents and claiming to rely upon
them in order to prove a
stated conclusion: <i> Philipps v Philipps</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1898%5d%202%20QB%20127" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1898] 2 QB 127.</a>
<P>

11	The defendant relies on these principles to attack paragraph 29A itself.  As
to the adequacy of the particulars supporting paragraph
29A, the defendants
refer to <i>Trade Practices Commission v David Jones (Australia) Pty
Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1985/228.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] FCA 228</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%207%20FCR%20109" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 7 FCR 109</a>, 112-113 where it was said that all material facts
constituting the cause of action ought already to be plainly stated in the
pleading
itself, rather than in the particulars, since the opposing party ought
not to be required to plead to particulars.  It was also said
that the proper
function of particulars is not to state material facts omitted from the
statement of claim nor to fill in the gaps.
<P>

12	Applying those principles as best I can to paragraph 29A and its
particulars, I have reached the conclusion that the paragraph
pleads the
material facts upon which the plaintiffs propose to rely with respect to some
of the ingredients of estoppel by convention,
but that the paragraph omits to
plead clearly enough one of the ingredients which the modern law requires.  
<P>

13	If one refers to Peter Gibson J's presentation of the requirements of
estoppel by convention, it is evident that paragraph 1
of that formulation is
adequately pleaded in paragraphs 29A(a)-(c).  There the plaintiffs assert that
the parties dealt with each
other and that they did so on the basis of an
assumption.  The assumption is specifically stated as an assumption that ABC
had been
substituted for ATS in the joint venture.  
<P>

14	The dealings are not pleaded but it is unnecessary in the statement of claim
itself that those facts be particularised.  Indeed
the very articulation of the
point implies the distinction which seems to me to be crucial, namely the
distinction between the assertion
of the material fact and the support of that
fact by particulars.
<P>

15	So far as paragraph 2 of the formulation by Peter Gibson J is concerned,
paragraph 29A(d) formulates an assertion which is identical
in substance with
Peter Gibson J's formulation.  So far as paragraph 3 of Peter Gibson J's
formulation is concerned, paragraph 29A(e)
contains an assertion along the same
lines as Peter Gibson J's formulation.
<P>

16	In my opinion that what is missing from the two sub-paragraphs of the
statement of claim is a clear articulation of the material
facts which lead to
the conclusion that the parties have regulated their subsequent dealings on the
basis of the assumption which
is pleaded in such a manner which would be unjust
or unconscionable for one of the parties to resile.  There needs to be some
assertion
of a material fact or facts which establishes a change of position or
detrimental reliance supplying what seems to me to be an otherwise
missing
ingredient of the estoppel which is pleaded.  That some such requirement is
needed appears to me to flow from cases on estoppel
by convention since the
<i>Texas Commerce</i> case, although the requirement might be loosened to a
degree in the special sub-category known as estoppel by deed:  see <i>Ferno
Holdings Pty Ltd v Lee </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20NSW%20ConvR%2055%2d645" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) NSW ConvR 55-645</a>;  <i>Offshore Oil NL v
Southern Cross Exploration NL </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20NSWLR%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 NSWLR 337</a>;  R Derham, `Estoppel by
Convention'  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2071%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20860" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 71 ALJ 860</a>, 976, esp. at 985, 987.
<P>

17	I therefore conclude that while the pleading in paragraph 29A(a)-(c) is
sufficient to assert the existence of a course of dealing
based upon an
assumption, paragraph 29A(d)-(e) are not sufficient to assert the essential
material facts relating to change of position
or detrimental reliance.
<P>

18	So far as the particulars are concerned, in my opinion they have been
prepared on the basis of a proper distinction between the
pleading of material
facts in the pleading itself and the articulation of particulars pursuant to
the pleading.  However, as the
heading of the particulars itself declares, the
particulars are no more than particulars of the dealings between the relevant
parties
and they do not particularise any other matters, such as, especially,
the element of change of position or detrimental reliance.
<P>

19	So far as paragraph 112A is concerned, the defendants attack the pleading
principally because it asserts that Rockbid terminated
the rights of ATS `as it
was entitled to do'.  It is said that the pleading does not assert the material
facts upon the basis of
which that entitlement arose.
<P>

20	In my opinion the pleading is sufficient, in that it asserts the fact of
termination and it asserts that the termination was
by a notice, the date of
which is specified and the source of which is given by reference to clause 11.3
of the first joint venture
agreement.  I believe that in the context of the
remainder of the statement of claim paragraph 112A is a sufficient pleading.
<P>

21	I therefore propose to allow counsel for the plaintiff time to consider
whether to press on with the application for amendment
to introduce paragraphs
8B and 8C and to review the draft amendment in paragraph 29A and particulars
supporting that paragraph in
light of the reasons which I have just
delivered.
<P>

22	I am very much concerned with potential prejudice to the defendants and for
that reason, without giving any formal direction
to this effect, I note that I
expect counsel for the plaintiffs to indicate his clients' intentions with
respect to paragraph 29A,
8B and 8C when the hearing resumes tomorrow
morning.
