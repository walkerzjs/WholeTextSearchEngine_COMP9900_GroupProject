<P>

1	<b>ADAMS J:  </b>On 20 May 1998 the plaintiff was convicted of attempting to
commit the offence prescribed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s269.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 269(1)(ac)</a> and committing an offence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s269.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
269(1)(ad)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</i> 1966</a> (the Act).  
<P>

2	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s269.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 269(1)(ac)</a> is as follows -
<P>

	"(1)	An undischarged bankrupt shall not:
<P>

	(ac)	either alone or jointly with another person, obtain goods or services
from a person by promising to pay that person or another
person an amount of,
or amounts aggregating, $3,000 or more without informing that person that he or
she is an undischarged bankrupt;
..."
<P>

The prosecution case was a simple one.  Between 24 May 1994 and 9 July 1994,
the Bloomfield Galleries in Sydney conducted an exhibition
of original works by
Norman Lindsay.  The plaintiff attended the exhibition and informed Ms
Bloomfield, the director of the gallery,
that he wished to buy two pencil
drawings, one etching and a pen and ink drawing for a total price in excess of
$28,100.  The plaintiff
was informed that a 10% deposit was required with the
balance payable at the end of the exhibition and it was clear that the works
would not be delivered until payment in full had been made.  A deposit of
$2,810 was paid, representing 10% of the proposed purchase
price.  It was
conceded that at all relevant times the plaintiff was an undischarged bankrupt.

<P>

3	The Oxford English Dictionary (2nd edition) defines "obtain" as "to come into
the possession or enjoyment of (something) by one's
own effort, or by request;
to procure or gain, as the result of purpose and effort;  hence, generally, to
acquire, get".  In my view,
the phrase "obtain goods" in               <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s269.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
269(1)(ac)</a>, to adopt the language of Street CJ in <i>R v Petronius-Kuff</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%203%20NSWLR%20178" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 3 NSWLR 178</a> at 181 when discussing <i>R v Arnold</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWLawRp/1883/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1883] NSWLawRp 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281883%29%204%20LR%20%28NSW%29%20347" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1883) 4 LR (NSW)
347</a>, is not directed to the concept of technical property, but rather to
physical custody of objects;  to "obtain goods" is to effect
the translation of
physical custody in an object.
<P>

4	In this case, the plaintiff had placed himself in a position where, on
payment of the purchase price, he might obtain the works.
 If the payment
accompanied the obtaining of the goods, they would have been obtained, not by
virtue of any promise to pay but rather
by the payment itself.  It is said,
however, that the promise to pay, in the absence either of obtaining the works
or seeking to
obtain them, amounted to an attempted commission of the offence
prescribed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s269.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 269(1)(ac).</a>  
<P>

5	It is clear that in order that an attempt be established it is a necessary
prerequisite to establish that there be an intention
to commit the substantive
crime:  <i>R v Mohan</i> [1976] QB1;  <i>DPP v Stonehouse</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%20AC%2055" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] AC 55</a>;
<i>Giorgianni v The Queen</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 29</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20156%20CLR%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 156 CLR 473</a>;  <i>Trade Practices
Commission v Tubemakers of Australia Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1983/93.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] FCA 93</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%2047%20ALR%20719" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 47 ALR 719</a> at 737;
<i>Trade Practices Commission v Mobil Oil Australia Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1984/238.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] FCA 238</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%2055%20ALR%20527" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 55 ALR
527.</a>  The mere fact that the plaintiff had entered into an agreement to
purchase the works could not justify the inference that he intended,
when he
obtained the paintings, to do so by promising to pay for them as distinct from
actually paying for them, let alone by promising
to pay for them without
informing Ms Bloomfield that he was an undischarged bankrupt.
<P>

6	It was submitted, however, that the plaintiff did an act towards the
commission of the offence charged which went beyond mere
preparation and
consequently that an attempt was committed.  However, such an act would only
constitute an attempt where it "cannot
reasonably be regarded as having any
purpose other than the commission" of the crime intended to be committed:
<i>Mai &amp; Tran</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2060%20A%20Crim%20R%2049" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 60 A Crim R 49</a> at 59.  
<P>

7	It was argued that the section is clearly aimed at protecting persons from
unwittingly doing business with bankrupt persons and
(implicitly) that, even if
there was no relevant intention, the offence was one of strict liability and
therefore an attempt might
nevertheless have been committed.  This submission
cannot be accepted.  In the circumstances of this case, if the plaintiff were
in a position to obtain the works by the payment of cash or, perhaps, by barter
of his property, and intended to do so, I do not
think that he would have
committed the substantive charge.  The use of the word "goods" rather than
"property" indicates that what
must be obtained is a tangible chattel rather
than a chose in action.  No doubt, it was for this reason that the charge of
committing
the substantive offence was not pressed in the Local Court.  
<P>

8	It is important to note that the obligation to disclose does not arise when
arrangements (to use a neutral term) are made to obtain
goods or services.  The
mere fact that, in one sense, such an arrangement may be characterised in
ordinary parlance as an attempt
to obtain goods does not mean that an attempt
to commit an offence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s269.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 269(1)(ac)</a> has occurred.  A promise to purchase
goods is not, by itself, an attempt to obtain goods without informing the
person providing them
that he or she is an undischarged bankrupt.  
<P>

Accordingly, the conviction must be quashed.
<P>

9	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s269.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 269(1)(ad)</a> is in the following terms - 
<P>

	"(1)	An undischarged bankrupt shall not:
<P>

	(ad)	either alone or jointly with another person, obtain an amount of, or
amounts aggregating, $3,000 or more from a person by
promising to supply goods
to, or render services for, that person or another person without informing
that person that he or she
is an undischarged bankrupt;  or..."
<P>

10	In late August 1992 a Mr Malcolm John Newstead saw an advertisement in the
Financial Review newspaper headed "Need Finance?"
and inviting interested
persons to "phone now and discuss your needs with one of our representatives".
On the following line appeared,
in small but nevertheless easily readable
print, "RANCHCAMM PTY LTD T/A" and on the next line in much bolder and larger
font "JAMES
W BYRNES".  Mr Byrnes' name was very much more prominent than that
of the company.  Nevertheless, the advertisement made it clear
enough that the
company was trading as James W Byrnes.  Mr Newstead said that he telephoned the
number given in the advertisement
and spoke to one Mr Delaney who made an
appointment for him at an address in North Sydney.  Mr Newstead attended those
premises and,
after a brief conversation with Mr Delaney, was introduced to Mr
Byrnes who, in effect, said that he was a broker and obtained details
from Mr
Newstead relating to his financial position and the proposed borrowing.  He was
told that he needed to provide certain other
information, essentially of a
financial kind relating to his company, and that "an upfront fee" was payable
amounting to 1% of the
total loan, described by Mr Byrnes as "a commitment
fee".  Mr Newstead said that Mr Byrnes told him that the payment of this fee
was "an act of good faith ... to show that I was interested" and that it would
have to be paid before he would proceed with any attempts
to obtain finance.
Mr Newstead said that no mention was made by Mr Byrne of any company, in
particular, Ranchcamm Pty Limited (Ranchcamm)
or Barroleg Pty Limited
(Barroleg).  Over objection, Mr Newstead was permitted to give evidence that
his understanding at the time
of the conversation was that Mr Byrnes would act
on his behalf in attempting to arrange for finance (implicitly, acting as a
principal
rather than an agent).  Several days later, Mr Newstead returned with
bank cheques totalling $17,625 made out in favour of J W Byrnes
&amp;
Associates.  He was given a receipt on the letterhead of J W Byrnes &amp;
Associates in the following terms -
<P>

	"This receipt is to confirm that cheques to the total of $17,625 have been
received from Malcolm Newstead on the above date."
<P>

He was also handed a letter at the same time on the letterhead of J W Byrnes
&amp; Associates referring to an application for finance
"which we have
received" and stating "we are undertaking to organise the finance on your
behalf".  The letter was signed, simply,
"J W Byrnes".  In cross examination,
Mr Newstead was asked whether he was told by Mr Delaney that he was dealing
with a company.
 His answer was -
<P>

	"No I wasn't told.  The words may have been there but it wasn't explained that
I was dealing with a company so which do you want,
whether it was explained to
me or was it told to me in a way that I didn't grasp."
<P>

He conceded that it was possible that he had been told by Mr Delaney that he
was dealing with a company.  He said that, when he
saw the advertisement, he
did not notice the name Ranchcamm.  The cheques handed over by Mr Newstead were
banked into a trading account
of Ranchcamm.  Company extracts from the
Australian Securities Commission show that at the relevant time there was one
director of
Barroleg namely Jacqueline Byrnes.  One James Warren Burns was a
director between 31 May 1989 and 28 May 1992.  June Edithe Byrnes
was the
secretary of the company.  It appears that June Edithe Byrnes and Jacqueline
Byrnes each held one share and that there were
no other shareholders.  The
information disclosed by the company extracts from the Australian Securities
Commission in relation to
Ranchcamm is not materially different.  Tendered to
the Local Court was a record of interview between Sergeant Hume and the
plaintiff
of 28 August 1995.  Mr Byrne said that he had registered Barroleg
and, prior to his bankruptcy was a director of it.  June Byrnes
was his mother
and Jacqueline, his ex-wife, was also a director.  He said in his interview
that James W Byrnes &amp; Associates became
a registered trading name owned by
Barroleg but on licence to Ranchcamm.  Barroleg is the trustee of an entity
known as the Barroleg
Trust as, indeed, Ranchcamm was the trustee of the
Ranchcamm Trust.  The beneficiaries of this latter trust comprise Barroleg and
Mr Brynes' mother, his ex-wife and any children that Mr Byrnes might have.  Mr
Byrnes claimed that he was an employee of Ranchcamm.
 Mr Byrnes described his
work as "just to go and earn money for the company and make sure it gets paid
in".  Mr Byrnes said that
whilst a bankrupt he did not do any business for
himself but was employed for the whole of the period working for the company.

<P>

11	The information charged the plaintiff for "being an undischarged bankrupt
did <i>alone</i> obtain from Malcolm Newstead an amount in excess of $3,000
namely the sum of $17,625 by promising to render services to the said
Malcolm
Newstead without informing Newstead that he was an undischarged bankrupt"
(emphasis added).  The case was argued before the
learned magistrate, as before
me, on the basis that that the plaintiff acted alone was an element of the
offence, not merely an immaterial
averment.
<P>

12	A business names' extract shows that James W Byrnes &amp; Associates was
registered on 27 July 1992 carrying on the business
of equipment hire, that
Barroleg ceased carrying on business as James W Byrnes &amp; Associates on 30
June 1993 and that Ranchcamm
commenced carrying on the business using that
business name on 1 July 1993.
<P>

13	The magistrate found that the plaintiff was so inextricably intertwined in
the affairs of Ranchcamm trading as James W Byrnes
&amp; Associates that "he is
unable to stand apart from it as it were".  I have not set out the reasoning of
the learned magistrate
which led her to this conclusion, but it demonstrates to
my mind that that conclusion was not only reasonable, it was inevitable.
 The
fundamental difficulty with this line of reasoning, so far as the conviction is
concerned, however, is that if, indeed, Ranchcamm
had an independent legal
personality apart from the plaintiff (or the state of evidence was such that
this fact could not be excluded
beyond reasonable doubt) it followed that the
plaintiff and the company acted together rather than that Mr Byrne acted alone.
If
the issue was whether the plaintiff was dealing with Mr Newstead personally
or whether in such dealings he was simply acting as Ranchcamm's
agent (see
<i>Maharaj</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2085%20A%20Crim%20R%20374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 85 A Crim R 374</a> at 380) the learned magistrate found,
upon ample evidence, that he was not acting personally.  The learned magistrate
was not asked
to conclude, and there was at all events no basis for concluding,
that Ranchcamm was a mere sham or facade.  At the material time,
as I have
pointed out, the evidence showed that the directors were persons other than the
plaintiff who, also, held no shares in
the company.  There was no evidentiary
basis for concluding (and it appears the prosecution did not at all events
contend) that the
company was a mere emanation or alter ego of the plaintiff.
But, even if it were, that would not suffice to ignore its legal existence:
see <i>R v Goodall</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%2011%20SASR%2094" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 11 SASR 94</a>, per Bray CJ at 100, 101;  <i>Hamilton
v Whitehead</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/65.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 65</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20166%20CLR%20121" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 166 CLR 121.</a>  Metaphors can be misleading and obscure
rather than elucidate legal principle.
<P>

14	In <i>Denis Wilcox Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2079%20ALR%20267" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988)
79 ALR 267</a> the Federal Court of Australia cited with approval the observation
by Young J in <i>Pioneer Concrete Services Pty Limited v Yelnah Pty Limited</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2011%20ACLR%20108" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 11 ACLR 108</a> that the separate legal personality of a company is to be
disregarded only if the court can see that there is, in fact or in law,
or that
there is a mere sham or facade in which the company is playing a role, or that
the creation or use of the company was designed
to enable a fiduciary
obligation to be evaded or a fraud to be perpetrated.  
<P>

15	Of course, if there was a partnership between Ranchcamm and the plaintiff
with respect to the transaction in question then the
plaintiff was not acting
alone.  On the other hand, there was no evidence capable of leading to the
conclusion that Ranchcamm was
a mere sham or facade nor that its use was
designed to enable a legal obligation to be evaded or a fraud to be
perpetrated.  The
learned magistrate was not asked, at all events, so to
conclude.  The matter is not resolved by Mr Newstead's expression of opinion
as
to the person with whom he was dealing.  In effect, the submission before me on
behalf of the defendant is that the learned magistrate's
finding to the effect
that the plaintiff had acted jointly with Ranchcamm was wrong and that the
evidence permitted the conclusion
that Ranchcamm had nothing whatever to do
with the transaction and accordingly, the ultimate conclusion of the learned
magistrate
that the plaintiff acted alone was justified by the evidence.  
<P>

16	Upon the facts found by the learned magistrate it seems to me, as I have
mentioned, that the inevitable conclusion was that the
plaintiff must have been
acquitted.  Not to have done so is, in my opinion, a fundamental error of law.
I am not persuaded that the
learned magistrate's findings were mistaken.  In
fact, I consider that they were inevitable.  Indeed, counsel for the defendant
in
this court does not submit that the learned magistrate's decision on the
facts was wrong but rather that the evidence permitted the
opposite decision
which, because of the jurisdiction exercised by the Supreme Court in these
applications, did not have to be determined
by me beyond reasonable doubt.  A
number of difficulties stand in the way of acceptance of this submission.
However, the most obvious
is that it cannot be suggested that the magistrate's
determination of the relationship between the plaintiff and the company was
so
flawed as to amount to an error of law (indeed, it is not even submitted that
it is an error of fact, merely that another conclusion
was open) and the only
error of law that can be demonstrated is that the finding of the magistrate
upon the facts as found by her
must have led to acquittal rather than
conviction.
<P>

17	In these circumstances, I consider that the conviction must be quashed.  I
should, however, observe that the question of the
relationship between the
plaintiff and Ranchcamm, which was a fundamental issue in the case, was made
obvious, if for no other reason,
by the wording of the advertisement which led
to Mr Newstead's seeking assistance.  In these circumstances, there is no
reason why
the information could not have alleged that the plaintiff was acting
either alone or jointly with Ranchcamm.  It is surprising that
this course was
not adopted.  
<P>

18	The plaintiff must have his costs.
