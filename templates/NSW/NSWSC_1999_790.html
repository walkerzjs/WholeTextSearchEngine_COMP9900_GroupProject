<b>MASTER McLAUGHLIN</b>
<P>

<i>Wednesday, 4 August 1999</i>
<P>

<b>1365 of 1995	SUSAN VINCENT   -v-   NADIA ZANATTA AND DOMENICO ZANATTA</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b>   These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act</i> 1982</a>. 
<P>

2   	By summons filed on 17 February 1995 Susan Vincent
(n&eacute;e Susanna Vincetich), the plaintiff, claims an order for provision
for her maintenance and advancement in life out of the estate of her late
father, Romano Vincetich (to whom I shall refer "the deceased").
<P>

3   	The deceased died on 28 August 1994, aged 86 years. He left
a will dated 12 November 1993, probate whereof was on 26 October
1994 granted
to Nadia Zanatta and Domenico Zanatta, the executors named in such will (who
are the defendants to the present proceedings).
<P>

4   	By that will the deceased gave to the plaintiff a legacy of
$20,000. He gave the residue of his estate to be divided among
the two
defendants and their three children (being Davide Zanatta, Sandra Capogreco and
Jason Zanatta).
<P>

5   	Clause 5 of the will is in the following terms,
<P>

<u>I DECLARE</u> that I have not made any further provision for my said
daughter <u>SUSANNA VINCETICH</u> because she has mistreated me and has done
nothing for me.
<P>

(I would here interpolate that the plaintiff had anglicised her name when she
was aged about fifteen with the concurrence of the
deceased.)
<P>

6   	The assets of the deceased, as disclosed in the Inventory
of Property, consisted of a house property at 11 Waterloo Street,
Bulli (to
which was ascribed a value of $120,000), the contents of that house property
(to which was ascribed a value of $200), and
moneys held in banks on deposit
(totalling a little over $53,000). 
<P>

7   	The value of the house property has increased since the
date of the death of the deceased, and valuation evidence placed before
the
Court indicated that its present value was $190,000. 
<P>

8   	The plaintiff (who was born on 14 September 1953, and is
presently aged 45) is the only surviving child of the deceased. As
such, she is
an eligible person within paragraph (b) of the definition of that phrase
contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. Accordingly, she
has the standing to bring the present proceedings. Indeed, the plaintiff is the
only eligible person in relation
to the deceased. Neither of the defendants
(who are respectively the niece of the deceased and her husband) is an eligible
person
in relation to the deceased; neither are any of their children such
eligible persons. 
<P>

9   	The legacy of $20,000 to the plaintiff has been paid . The
present nature of the assets in the estate is set forth in the affidavit
of
Ernest Charles Curtis, the solicitor for the defendants, sworn 18 February
1999. The assets consist of the house property at Bulli
and cash in hand. The
amount of cash in hand has diminished to $7,909.82 (in consequence of payment
of insurance premiums, Wollongong
Council rates, and legal costs associated
with the present proceedings). Mr Curtis in that affidavit estimated that the
costs of
the defendant executors of the present proceedings will total $40,318.
It will be appreciated that the amount of cash held by the
defendants will be
exhausted in the payment of their costs of the present proceedings, and that
the defendants will then be entitled
to sell the Bulli house in order to meet
the balance of their costs.
<P>

10   	On behalf of the plaintiff there was filed an affidavit by
her solicitor, Gregory John Woods, affirmed 17 February 1999, which
set forth
that the plaintiff had incurred and was expected to incur in respect to the
present proceedings costs totalling $40,681.
It was, however, acknowledged by
Counsel for the plaintiff that those costs were on the solicitor and client
basis, rather than on
the party and party basis. 
<P>

11   	When allowance is made for the costs of the plaintiff, as
well as those of the defendant, it is unlikely that the net distributable
estate will exceed $110,000. 
<P>

12   	The plaintiff is in receipt of a disability pension, which
is her only source of income. It would appear that that pension
has been
allowed to her as a result of a chronic back problem from which she suffers,
being described as a degenerative condition
of the lower lumbar spine.
According to the plaintiff that condition is rheumatoid arthritis which she
developed at the age of fifteen
years. The disability arising out of that
condition has gradually worsened, with consequent limitation upon her ability
to work.
She has not been in employment since March 1991, at which time she was
granted her disability pension. That pension is now in an
amount of $372.80 a
fortnight. The plaintiff has no other income. 
<P>

13   	Although there was no specific evidence in this regard, I
infer that the plaintiff has no assets apart from personal and household
effects, and that she has no liabilities.
<P>

14   	The plaintiff since the death of the deceased has
continued to reside in the house property at 11 Waterloo Street, Bulli.
Although she pays such personally incurred outgoings as telephone and
electricity for her occupation of that house property, she
does not pay any
council rates or the cost of repairs, and she does not pay any rent or
occupation fee. 
<P>

15   	In her affidavit of 12 June 1998 the plaintiff set forth
details of her fortnightly expenses, totalling $372.50 (being almost
the
precise amount of her income).
<P>

16   	In performing the first stage in the two stage process
recognised by the High Court of Australia in <i>Singer v Berghouse</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994)
181 CLR 201</a> at 208 (per Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ), the Court must
determine whether the plaintiff has been left without adequate provision
for
her proper maintenance, education and advancement in life. 
<P>

17   	Upon the foregoing summary of the evidence concerning the
financial and material circumstances of the plaintiff, it is apparent
that she
has been left without adequate provision for her proper maintenance. 
<P>

18   	However, the defendants assert that the plaintiff has been
guilty of conduct disentitling her from the benefit of any order
for provision
an entitlement to which she might otherwise have established. 
<P>

19   	The hearing very largely concentrated upon the allegations
made by the defendants concerning such disentitling conduct on
the part of the
plaintiff, and the responses of the plaintiff to those allegations. 
<P>

20   	I have already recorded the statement made by the deceased
in clause 5 of his will, containing the allegation by him that
the plaintiff
had "mistreated" the deceased and had "done nothing" for him. That will was
executed on 12 November 1993. 
<P>

21   	Less than two months later, on 3 January 1994 the
deceased, who at that time was a resident in the Canterbury District Nursing
Home, dictated to the first defendant a letter which she then typed out for
him. That letter was written in Italian. On the same
date the first defendant
arranged for a solicitor, Mary Salama, of 509 Burwood Road, Belmore, to attend
at the nursing home in order
to witness the execution by the deceased of a
power of attorney in favour of the first defendant. That power of attorney was
witnessed
by Mrs Salama, who also, at the request of the deceased, witnessed
the letter which had been prepared by the first defendant at the
dictation of
the deceased  --- I gather Mrs Salama to have been fluent in the Italian
language. That letter is annexure A to the
affidavit of the first defendant
sworn 28 March 1996. The letter is in Italian. However, a translation into
English appears upon
annexure A as follows,
<P>

I, Romano Vincetich, declare that I have changed my will because my daughter
Susanna has never contributed anything in the home
(financially or in daily
help) &amp; I think she has no right to the toils of my wife and I.
<P>

She has only mistreated me while I was in my own home. She has taken a large
amount of money and all my wife's &amp; my jewellery.
I now leave her only the
sum of $20,000. I leave nothing else of my property or the contents of my home.

<P>

22   	The evidence discloses that the plaintiff, who to that
time had been residing with her parents, left home shortly before her
twenty-first birthday, which would have been in 1974. It was asserted on behalf
of the defendants that she remained away from home
for a period of about ten
years, and that her contact with her parents during that period was infrequent
and irregular. 
<P>

23   	The plaintiff, however, denied the assertion that she had
moved away from home for ten years from 1974, and said that the
period of her
absence was for only about eighteen months, and that throughout that period she
maintained regular contact with her
parents both by letter and by telephone.
The plaintiff said also that upon her return to the family home at Bulli she
resided there
continuously, firstly with both her parents and then, after the
death of her mother in May 1989, with her father, until the end of
November
1992 when she moved to Queensland for about three months, returning to Bulli in
early March 1993. There was admitted into
evidence a considerable quantity of
cards and letters which the plaintiff during each of those absences from Bulli
had sent to her
mother and to her father, which cards and letters been retained
by her parents. 
<P>

24   	Evidence was given by the defendants of various complaints
made by the deceased concerning the attitude of the plaintiff towards
him.
However, it would appear that any such complaints were made, substantially,
only after the death of the plaintiff's mother in
May 1989. 
<P>

25   	Concerning the statement made by the deceased in his will
relating to the conduct of the plaintiff and concerning the various
complaints
about her attitude towards him which were attributed to the deceased by the
defendants, it is relevant here to record
that on 6 October 1989 the deceased
made a will by which he appointed the plaintiff his sole executor and gave to
her the entirety
of his estate. (It is interesting to note that one of the
witnesses to that will was the second defendant, Nadia Zanatta, who also
translated it into Italian for the deceased at the time of its execution.)
<P>

26   	According to the evidence of the first defendant the
deceased, after the death of his wife, on one occasion said to the first
defendant that he did not approve of the plaintiff's drinking or of her lesbian
lifestyle. 
<P>

27   	A considerable quantity of evidence was directed to an
incident in about 1982 or 1983 when the second defendant was requested
by the
plaintiff's mother to travel from his residence at Woonona to Sydney, in order
to collect the plaintiff's belongings and to
bring the plaintiff home to Bulli.

<P>

28   	The first defendant gave evidence that after the death of
his wife the deceased told her that (apart from the cooking of boiled
vegetables by the plaintiff, which the deceased was not able to eat) he did all
the washing, ironing, cooking and cleaning, and that
the plaintiff did not
assist him in any way, especially that she did not assist him in his vegetable
garden, in which he took pride.
Apparently the deceased, according to the first
defendant, complained that if plaintiff did any household shopping it was only
with
money provided to her for that purpose by the deceased. Complaints by the
deceased concerning the consequences of the plaintiff's
alleged drinking were
also set forth in the evidence of the first defendant.
<P>

29   	Evidence was given by the first defendant concerning the
condition of the bedroom of the deceased in his residence in the
latter months
of 1993, and assertions by the first defendant concerning what the first
defendant regarded as the untidy and insanitary
condition of that bedroom. The
first defendant gave evidence concerning an apparently forceful entry by
herself and her husband into
the residence of the deceased, in the company of
police, against the will of the plaintiff. 
<P>

30   	Complaints were made by the defendants against the
plaintiff for the alleged infrequency of her visits to the deceased during
his
numerous periods in hospital in the latter years of his life, especially in
1993 and 1994. 
<P>

31   	There was an incident in the early hours of the morning of
Monday, 8 November 1993, when the deceased, having obtained the
services of a
neighbour, one Mick Duff, to drive him to the residence of the defendants,
there made statements virtually alleging
that the plaintiff had stolen all his
money and jewels. 
<P>

32   	The evidence given by the plaintiff concerning the period
of her residence with her father after the death of her mother was
totally at
odds with the foregoing evidence of the defendants concerning their own
personal observations and concerning various allegations
attributed by them to
the deceased. According to the plaintiff, she had a close and loving
relationship with both her parents. After
the death of her mother she looked
after her father, kept the house clean and tidy, attended to her father's
needs, did all the housework
and cooking, visited her father frequently and
regularly during his numerous periods in hospital. The plaintiff totally denied
the
allegations concerning her drinking habits. 
<P>

33   	It will be appreciated that the deceased is no longer
available to give his version of what happened during the latter years
of his
life. However, evidence of an independent nature was available from Dr Luciano
Antony Diana, who had been the medical attendant
of the deceased from August
1985 until his death on 28 August 1994. Dr Diana also intermittently acted as
medical attendant upon
the plaintiff. He came to know the deceased and the
plaintiff purely in a professional capacity. Dr Diana was also a witness to the
will of the deceased. 
<P>

34   	On account of the many house calls which he made to the
residence at 11 Waterloo Street, Bulli, Dr Diana came to know the
deceased and
the plaintiff very well in a domestic setting. In his affidavit of 28 March
1996 Dr Diana set forth the physical problems
from which the deceased was
suffering during the nine years whilst Dr Diana attended upon him. Those
physical problems were mainly
osteoarthritis of the hip and the lumbosacral
spine, prostatomegaly peripheral vascular disease and a number of episodes of
deep
venous thrombosis. Dr Diana said that because of these conditions the
deceased required multiple hospitalisation and, when he was
no longer
physically able to care for himself, was finally admitted to the Marco Polo
Nursing Home at Unanderra, 
<P>

35   	Dr Diana said that during those illnesses of the deceased
he liaised, in the main, with the first defendant. Whenever the
plaintiff was
present during his house calls she was, according to the doctor, usually
heavily under the influence of alcohol. He
recorded his observation that the
plaintiff was not doing anything to help the deceased around the house. In
response to a request
by him of the community nurse, he was informed that the
plaintiff was "not helping her father with anything around the house. He
manages to cook for himself. His niece [presumably, the first defendant] gives
him his medication each day".
<P>

36   	Although in his affidavit Dr Diana said that during house
calls he encountered numerous instances when the plaintiff was verbally
aggressive and insulting to her father, and that she was usually inebriated,
under cross-examination the doctor said that quite a
few times he observed what
he described as "some verbal friction" between the plaintiff and the deceased,
and he explained that phrase
as meaning that the plaintiff "sometimes spoke
roughly" to her father. 
<P>

37   	Dr Diana was present when the deceased executed his last
will on 12 November 1993. That will was executed at Dr Diana's surgery
as part
of a consultation. Not only was Dr Diana one of the witnesses to the will but
he also translated the will, which was written
in English, into Italian for the
benefit of the deceased, and certified that fact in the document itself ("he
being able to understand
the Italian language but having an imperfect knowledge
of the English language after I the witness Luciano Antony Diana who
understands
both the Italian and English languages had read the will over to
the Testator in English and then had truly translated it into Italian
language
to the Testator which reading and translation were done in our presence when
the Testator stated to me his understanding
and approval of the will..."). Also
present on the occasion when the will was executed were Mr E. C. Curtis,
solicitor (who was the
other witness to the execution of the will), and the
first defendant.
<P>

38   	Dr Diana in his affidavit expressed the view that the
deceased was perfectly clear of mind and was fully oriented in time,
place and
person, and that he clearly understood the will. In this regard, it will be
appreciated that there has been no challenge
to the validity of the will, or to
the testamentary capacity of the deceased at the time of the execution of the
will. 
<P>

39   	I have already observed that there was a total divergence
between the evidence of the defendants on the one hand and the evidence
of the
plaintiff on the other concerning the relationship between the plaintiff and
the deceased, and concerning the manner in which
the plaintiff cared for the
deceased during the period until he went into the nursing home. The
cross-examination of the second defendant,
Domenico Zanatta, revealed a
considerable number of inconsistencies between that witness's oral evidence and
his affidavit evidence.
For example, the assertions in his affidavit evidence
concerning his observations during his visits to the Bulli residence did not
substantiate his affidavit evidence, in that he agreed that (despite his
earlier assertion that it "smelt strongly of urine") there
was no specific
smell of urine in the house, and that he did not see a urinal bottle (let alone
an unemptied such bottle). His assertion
as to the condition of the house (that
it was "in a filthy state") was reduced, under cross-examination, to a
statement that the
house "was not as tidy" as it had been years before. 
<P>

40   	Even his evidence about collecting the plaintiff from
Sydney and bringing her back to Bulli in 1982 or 1983 was inconsistent
with
what he had said in his affidavit. Mr Zanatta in his affidavit of 28 March 1996
said that the plaintiff was living in Kings
Cross, where he collected her. That
is a location of a far less respectable reputation than the innocuous
residential suburb of Sans
Souci where, in fact, the plaintiff had been living.
Whilst in his affidavit the request was said to emanate from the plaintiff's
mother, it emerged from Mr Zanatta's cross-examination that it was the deceased
who directed Mr Zanatta to Sans Souci, and even accompanied
him there on the
trip. Mr Zanatta's acknowledged familiarity with Sydney was such that he could
not have genuinely mistaken Sans
Souci for Kings Cross. 
<P>

41   	The assertions of the first defendant Nadia Zanatta, were
also considerably qualified under cross-examination. For example,
the assertion
that the plaintiff had left home just before her twenty-first birthday and had
not returned home for ten years, was
reduced to an attribution by that witness
to the deceased that the plaintiff had left home just before her twenty-first
birthday
and that for a period of four years the deceased and his wife did not
know where she was. The oral evidence of the first defendant
disclosed that she
had never spent much time with the deceased in his own home, and that most of
the contact which she had had with
her uncle had been away from his residence.
Her evidence disclosed a very considerable degree of animus against the
plaintiff. She
was also evasive, and far from frank, in evidence concerning her
own financial and material circumstances. 
<P>

42   	Under cross-examination the first defendant agreed that
the incident of 8 November 1993 was the only instance of any fight
or conflict
between the plaintiff and the deceased which was referred to in her affidavit.
She also agreed that until 12 November
1993, when he was admitted to hospital,
the deceased never expressed any wish to leave his home. Further, and
significantly, the
first defendant agreed that at no time did the deceased ever
express a wish to have the plaintiff removed from the Bulli residence.

<P>

43   	By the same token, of course, it will be appreciated that
the evidence of the plaintiff herself on such matters as her drinking
habits
and her standards and competence in domestic management, must be approached
with a considerable degree of caution. It is quite
clear from the evidence of
Dr Diana ---- which should be accepted as impartial and disinterested evidence
concerning these matters
--- that the plaintiff was frequently inebriated.
Indeed, Dr Diana throughout the period whilst he was the medical attendant to
the
plaintiff, treated and counselled her for alcohol abuse. According to Dr
Diana, the plaintiff, at the insistence of the deceased,
was admitted to Roma
House, a detoxification unit at Wollongong Hospital, in the early 1990s. 
<P>

44   	Dr Diana also said that, on account of her condition, he
regarded the plaintiff as not being in a suitable state to measure
out the
exact quantity of dosages of medication for the deceased. It was for that
reason that the first defendant and the community
nurse were required to give
the deceased his medication.
<P>

45   	It would appear that until the incident in early November
1993, when the deceased virtually accused the plaintiff of having
stolen his
jewels and his gold, the deceased (despite the observations of Dr Diana as to
the plaintiff's attitude towards her father)
was satisfied to have the
plaintiff living in the Bulli house and (whatever might have been her
shortcomings as a domestic manager)
to have her looking after him. It would
appear that the incident in the early hours of 8 November 1993 was the cause of
the deceased
making his will of 12 November 1993. I have already recorded that
the earlier will of the deceased, being that of 6 October 1989
(which appears
to have remained in force until revoked by the will of 12 November 1993) left
the entirety of the estate of the deceased
to the plaintiff. After he was
admitted to the Bulli Hospital on 12 November 1993 (immediately after making
his last will) the deceased
expressed his specific agreement to the plaintiff
continuing to reside in the family home.
<P>

46   	All the complaints which the deceased made against the
plaintiff appear to have been made in a four day period, from 8 November
to 12
November 1993 (at which time  the deceased was aged eighty-five years and was
in ill health). No such complaints had previously
been made, and no such
complaints were made thereafter. Despite the assertion of mistreatment made by
the deceased in his will, no
particulars of such alleged mistreatment were ever
given by the deceased either to his solicitor or to his doctor or to either of
the defendants or their children. Even after the alleged incident of 8 November
1993, the deceased recognised that he had an obligation
to make some provision
for the plaintiff in his will, by his gift to her of the sum of $20,000. 
<P>

47   	It has already been observed that the plaintiff is the
only eligible person in relation to the deceased. She was his only
surviving
child. Not only was she dependent upon the deceased for accommodation for most
of her life, and, especially, for the last
ten years of the deceased's life,
but the plaintiff lived with the deceased for a very long period without any
domestic disharmony.

<P>

48   	The various greeting cards and letters sent by the
plaintiff to the deceased and to her mother (and also greeting cards sent
to
her by her parents) support her assertion that, whatever might have been their
attitude towards her lifestyle, the relationship
of the plaintiff with her
parents was a close and affectionate one.
<P>

49   	The drinking habits of the plaintiff (which, although
denied by her, were substantiated by the evidence of Dr Diana) enhance
rather
than diminish the present claim of the plaintiff. 
<P>

50   	In my conclusion the matters relied upon by the defendant
as conduct disentitling the plaintiff from the benefit of further
provision
from the testamentary bounty of the deceased (those matters consisting
essentially of the events in the second week of
November 1993 --- some nine
months before the death of the deceased) are not such as should deprive the
plaintiff from an order for
provision for her maintenance. 
<P>

51   	There was no suggestion made by the defendants that the
plaintiff had given inaccurate or incomplete evidence concerning her
state of
health or concerning her ability to obtain remunerative employment. 
<P>

52   	The present essential need of the plaintiff is for
security of accommodation. That she does not presently have. Not only has
she
established a need in that regard, which cannot be fulfilled through her own
efforts, but also she has established an entitlement
to look to the estate of
her father, in respect to whom she is the only eligible person, for such
security of accommodation. 
<P>

53   	In approaching that claim of the plaintiff the Court must
consider any competing claims upon the bounty of the deceased. The
only such
competing claims are those of the beneficiaries named in his will, being the
two defendants and their three children. Those
five persons are the designated
objects of the testamentary beneficence of the deceased. 
<P>

54   	Accordingly, it is necessary to consider whether the
financial and material circumstances of each of those beneficiaries are
such as
would have the effect of reducing, or even extinguishing, any order for
provision, an entitlement to which the plaintiff
might otherwise have
established. 
<P>

55   	There is no obligation upon beneficiaries, who are
designated as such by a testator, to place before the Court any evidence
concerning their financial and material circumstances. If they do not, then the
Court is entitled to disregard the competing claims
of those beneficiaries, so
that any order for provision an entitlement to which a plaintiff might
otherwise have established will
not be reduced, or even extinguished, as a
result of such competing claims. If, however, the beneficiaries choose to
assert that,
on account of their competing claims, any entitlement of the
plaintiff should be reduced, or even extinguished, then it is incumbent
upon
those beneficiaries that their evidence concerning their own financial and
material circumstances should be as full and as frank
as possible. 
<P>

56   	I have already referred to the fact that at least the
first defendant was evasive and far from forthcoming in her evidence
concerning
her financial and material circumstances.
<P>

57   	It will be appreciated that, apart from the house
property, there will be no other assets available for distribution among
the
five beneficiaries. The house property has a present value of about $190,000.
After allowance is made for the expenses associated
with the sale of  that
property, and for the payment of the legal costs of the defendants out of such
proceeds of sale, it is probable
that each beneficiary named in the will would
receive no more than $30,000. 
<P>

58   	The second defendant is a self-employed builder, having
been involved in the building trade since 1961. He conducts that business
through the vehicle of a company, of which the two defendants are the directors
and the first defendant is the secretary. 
<P>

59   	Until recent times the defendants owned two properties,
apart from their residence. Both those properties (one at Albion Park,
the
other at Fairy Meadow) have recently been sold, realising a total amount of
$210,000. The defendants reside in a house property
at Woonona. No evidence was
given of the present value of that property. However, in her affidavit of 28
March 1996 the first defendant
said that that property was subject to a
mortgage of about $54,000 to Westpac Banking Corporation. 
<P>

60   	Affidavit evidence was put on by each of the three adult
children of the defendants, who are the three other beneficiaries
named in the
will of the deceased. The eldest child, Davide Alfredo Zanatta, was born on 12
November 1969 (and is presently twenty-nine
years of age). He is married, with
one child (presently aged three). Davide is employed as an operations manager
in a freight business
at Wollongong, by which he has been employed for more
than six years. He and his wife (who is not in regular employment, but does
some casual work), own their matrimonial home at Balgownie (valued at about
$157,000). They have savings of about $6,000, a 1986
Nissan motor vehicle (to
which a value of about $6,000 was ascribed), together with furniture and
personal effects. Their liabilities
consist of a mortgage debt of $149,000 and
a loan of $135,000 (the purpose of that loan was not revealed by the evidence).
Davide's
net income after tax is about $30,000 a year. 
<P>

61   	Sandra Zanatta (formerly known as Sandra Capogreco) was
born on 24 August 1971 and is presently aged twenty-seven. She is
a divorced
lady, who is not presently receiving any support from her former husband. She
has one child, aged seven. Sandra is not
in employment, and relies on social
welfare payments of about $1,000 a month, supplemented by gifts from her
father, to support herself
and her daughter. She and her daughter reside in
rented accommodation, paying $140 a week. Apart from some furniture and
personal
effects, her only asset is a 1987 Nissan Skyline motor vehicle, to
which she ascribes a value of about $6,000. She has debts of about
$8,750,
being moneys owed on her motor vehicle and by way of a loan from her family.

<P>

62   	Jason Zanatta was born on 14 February 1973, and is
twenty-six years of age. He is a single man residing at home with his parents.
He is employed as a carpenter by his parents' building business. For the year
ended 30 June 1996, he earned a gross income of $23,400.
He has $10,000
invested on a fixed deposit, but otherwise has no assets. He has no debts. 
<P>

63   	I do not consider that the competing claims of any of the
five beneficiaries are such as would have the effect of reducing,
let alone
extinguishing, any order for provision an entitlement to which the plaintiff
might otherwise have established. (It was
conceded by Senior Counsel for the
defendant that there was no competing financial need in respect to any of the
residuary beneficiaries.)
<P>

64   	I consider that he plaintiff has established an
entitlement to a benefit from the estate of the deceased which will, firstly,
enable her to have some degree of security and flexibility in her
accommodation, and will also provide for her a fund to meet unexpected
contingencies and to improve her extremely frugal lifestyle. The plaintiff
acknowledged that, because of the size of the estate,
it will be necessary for
the house property at Bulli to be sold, in order to meet the costs of the
defendant executors, and that,
in consequence, she must eventually leave that
property. 
<P>

65   	The size of the estate is not sufficient to enable a house
to be purchased for the plaintiff (even if the plaintiff had established
an
entitlement to receiving a residence from the estate). The most that can be
done is to assist the plaintiff in meeting the rent
of appropriate rental
accommodation. The plaintiff placed before the Court material concerning the
cost of rental accommodation in
the Bulli area, but not any precise information
concerning Social Security benefits to which she might be entitled, by way of,
for
example, rental assistance or housing accommodation.
<P>

66   	The Court should not disturb the testamentary provisions
of the deceased except to the extent necessary to meet the foregoing
needs of
the plaintiff.
<P>

67   	In all the circumstances I consider that the plaintiff
should receive two-thirds of the residuary estate of her father (which
should
amount to about $73,000).
<P>

68   	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that, in addition to the benefit given to her by the will of the
late Romano Vincetich ("the deceased"), the plaintiff
receive two-thirds of the
residuary estate of the deceased.
<P>

2.	I order that the costs of the plaintiff on the party and party basis and the
costs of the defendants on the indemnity basis be
paid out of the estate of the
deceased.
<P>

3.	The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
