GREG JAMES, J.
<P>

THURSDAY 2 SEPTEMBER 1999
<P>

<center><b>REGINA v. SUNG EUN PARK</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  I have reached the conclusion that on the evidence
before me the present application - which is an application
by the Crown to
take certain evidence by video link - should not be granted.
<P>

2  	The motion seeking an order to allow the taking of audio-visual
evidence came before me today, 2 September, notice having been
given only as
recently as the last day or two of the month of August 1999.  Slightly earlier,
informal notice had been given, I am
advised by the Crown Prosecutor.  That
informal advice at best would have put the defence on notice that the Crown
might be minded
to make the application.  The defence objects to the proposed
course.
<P>

3  	The application has been brought at the death knell of a lengthy
process following the accused's apprehension and extradition
to Australia in
which he arrived on 17 May 1998, since when he has been subject to committal
proceedings, arraignment in this court,
and detention, bail refused on charges
of murder of his wife and two children.
<P>

4  	The murders are said to have occurred some time on or after 17
October 1996 and before 27 August 1997.  The accused left Australia
for Korea
on 29 October 1996.  He apparently travelled with Miss Hwang, his girlfriend,
who had been his girlfriend between October
1995 and October 1996.
<P>

5  	Miss Hwang is a Korean national ordinarily resident in Korea.  It
is said that whilst she was present in Australia, she had
a liaison with the
accused during which she provided a suitcase in which, so it is said, the
remains of the victims were found; 
accompanied him to a place at which that
suitcase, presumably containing those remains, was dumped;  advertised for sale
the property
of the deceased or at least property in which the deceased had a
matrimonial interest;  assisted with the uttering of forged instruments
to
obtain, by fraud, from bank accounts of the deceased and the deceased's
children, monies;  and was otherwise involved in conversations
with the
accused, such that her evidence of them would be highly incriminatory of him.
This evidence might be critical, one might
think, in the absence of hearing the
rest of the evidence against the accused, to the trial.
<P>

6  	With a degree of understatement, the affidavit of the Crown's
instructing solicitor refers to her as "an important witness"
in the Crown
case.  In that affidavit are chronicled attempts to obtain the testimony of
Miss Hwang.  It appears that shortly prior
to the committal, an investigating
officer became aware Miss Hwang was not prepared to travel back to the
committal from Korea. 
The prosecution did hold a statement of hers.  It had
been served but no other steps were taken at the committal, or subsequent to
the committal until this present application to secure her testimony in any
form in which it might be provided to a jury.
<P>

7  	The defence contends that, in the absence of consent from the
accused, I lack the power to make the order and should not, having
regard to
the correspondence seeking to persuade her to come to Australia and give
evidence, or to provide testimony by audio-visual
link, which, it is said, is
misleading, in particular in relation to an indemnity that correspondence
refers to which seems to suggest
she has achieved a wholesale immunity from
prosecution when, in fact, the evidence before me suggests that that immunity
is so limited
as not to protect her from a charge in Australia in the event of
direct involvement in the murder.
<P>

8  	Whether it be the case that this correspondence is misleading,
and whether it be the case or not that I have power under the
Rules and, in
particular, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p36" class="autolink_findacts">Part 36</a> Rule 2(a)(i) of the Supreme Court Rules (although I need
not decide it, I interpolate I would think I do, since the rule is hardly
there
to provide only for the case of consent, as in such circumstances the evidence
might be taken by that means and admitted for
that reason), I have come to the
firm conclusion, I should nonetheless refuse the application.  I consider that,
in the absence of
evidence persuading me of the willingness of the witness to
give evidence by means of audio-visual link and to give evidence truthfully
and
in accordance with some such sanction as an oath, to which the provisions of
Part 7 Chapter 4 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a> might apply, having regard to the
disadvantages that might occur to an accused which are set out at some length
in the decision of
his Honour Justice Badgery-Parker in <b>Regina v. Too</b>
(unreported 26 July 1996), even if I had power, the damages of permitting such
a witness to testify in these circumstances are too
high.
<P>

9  	The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.21</a>, requires evidence to be given subject to
an oath or affirmation.  That oath or affirmation is to be understood as an
oath or affirmation
which might attract the operation of the relevant
provisions of Divison 7.  True it is that the oath or affirmation might have,
in
the individual case, powerful spiritual or personal significance.  I,
however, have no evidence as to that as applying to the potential
witness.  The
Crown concedes that, where she is, no other sanction would attach to the
oath.
<P>

10  	I am confined, when attempting to ascertain the testimony of the
witness to her two statements of evidence, the second taken
through the
assistance of an interpreter and produced in transcript form, and to consider
the circumstances in which she came to
be involved in the events surrounding
these killings.  It is inevitable that her evidence will be attacked.  It is
inevitable that
criminality, and indeed serious criminality, will have to be
canvassed with her.  That may extend so far as suggesting to her a direct
involvement in these killings.  I am cognisant that the community's interests
in a trial for a crime so serious as this demand every
lawful and proper
opportunity be given to the Crown to bring forward all evidence that is
relevant, apparently reliable, and might
tend to disclose the truth to a jury.
I do not, by this judgment, exclude the Crown from putting forward the evidence
if it can do
so by some technique which will ensure that the evidence meets the
requirements to which other evidence is subject to enable it to
be properly
appreciated by a jury and properly tested in a matter of such significance.
<P>

11  	But, I cannot say, from the evidence before me, that I am
satisfied that the witness will give evidence honestly, and will
give evidence
in such a way as to satisfy these requirements.  Indeed the evidence before me
rather requires me, even to infer that
the video link facilities will provide
an adequate technical mode of putting the material before the jury, a matter
which would be
of some considerable significance if the rules to which I have
referred were to be applied.
<P>

12  	The test requires a balancing of the interests to which I have
referred - a fair trial for the accused, and a fair trial for
the Crown - that
is whether the use of the video link evidence in these circumstances would
advance the course of justice.
<P>

13  	Accepting the importance of the testimony and the possibility
that the testimony may well be unreliable, at least in significant
aspects, it
does not seem to me that I can, in those circumstances, receive the testimony
by a means such that it is given without
the sanction of the criminal law of
New South Wales and it is conceded both that the legal sanction of the oath
would be so limited
that it would not apply to the witness unless she were
prepared voluntarily to come back within the New South Wales jurisdiction
and
that there is no equivalent local sanction.
<P>

14  	I give this ruling now, rather than reserving to express the
reasons more adequately or to deal more widely with the very wide-ranging
arguments that have been presented, since this trial is due to commence before
me on Monday and the jury is to be empanelled at least
by Wednesday or earlier
if it may be.
<P>

15  	Since this is an interlocutory ruling, it will be open to the
Crown to renew the application if it can do so at a future time,
if it can put
forward a mode of obtaining the evidence which will serve the interests of
justice.  But, in that regard, it should
be clear that I will have in mind,
should the application be renewed, that apparently a deliberate choice was
made, albeit the choice
may have been reluctant, not to secure the testimony or
to permit the defence to test it at the committal stage, or indeed at any
time
prior to now.  It has been conceded, and very properly by the learned Crown
Prosecutor, that, were the testimony to be advanced,
then the defence would be
entitled, at least on nominated issues, to a preliminary examination of that
testimony by way of a pre-trial
or mini-trial.  In the event the application is
to be renewed, then consideration will have to be given as to whether the
testimony
can be secured with fairness to the accused, having that in mind.
<P>

16  	At present, on the state of the evidence before me, I am not
prepared to make the order sought in the motion, and dismiss the
motion.
