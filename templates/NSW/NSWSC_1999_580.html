<b>1765/99 - THE OWNERS OF STRATA PLAN 48754 V ANDERSON &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>   The present proceedings concern the extent of the
rights granted when the plaintiffs obtained a right of footway burdening Lot
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=9%20SP%2048754" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">9
SP 48754.</a>   The dominant property is the common property of the strata
building.
<P>

2	The strata plan refers to a building at 28 Stevenson Place Newcastle.  The
building is 6 storeys high.  One enters the building
onto Level 3 which,
passing through an entrance lobby, contains parking spaces.  One then goes down
below street level to Level 2
where there are two units and then to Level 1
which is constituted by Lot 9 in the strata plan.  There is at present no
physical
access between Level 1 and Level 2.  Anyone who wishes to enter the
building at Level 1 from the outside must do so through parklands
which adjoin
Level 1 at ground level.   In other words, there is a drop of two floors
between street level and the park.  The park
would appear to have been
originally part of the railway sidings that formerly extended east from
Newcastle railway station and the
land had been excavated and made level for
this purpose.  It would seem that the park is vested in the Newcastle City
Council.  The
evidence is there is no plan of management in respect of the
park. 
<P>

3	The three upper storeys of the building each have two units more or less
identical with those on Level 2.  The only appreciable
difference is that the
ceiling above the entrance lobby on Level 3 is cut away so that from the front
door of the building one can
actually see the lift lobby on Level 4.  
<P>

4	It would seem that when the building was originally constructed it was
envisaged that Lot 9 would be used for commercial purposes
such as, for
instance, family shops and refreshment facilities for members of the public
using the parklands.  I had a view of the
premises and Lot 9 (Level 1) is
completely undeveloped being just  bare walls and bare floor.  There are three
sets of windows and
three sets of doors facing north to the Hunter River.  
<P>

5	The building has a lift which services Levels 2 to 6.  Below the lift shaft
is a space on Level 1 for the lift to descend in an
emergency and also some
works for the lift.  Adjoining the shaft on Level 1 is a room containing the
computer and other equipment
to operate the lift.   Both the lift shaft and the
access room for the lift on Level 1 are part of the common property.  
<P>

6	The strata plan shows that commencing at the inside of the centre door
leading on to the parkland and proceeding in a straight
line until level with
the southern side of the lift shaft there is a  right of footway one metre
wide.  That right of footway makes
a 90 degree turn to the east and continues
to the eastern extremity of the lift access room.
<P>

7	The second defendant is the registered proprietor of Lot 9.  The first
defendant is the second defendant's controller and the
person who has done the
relevant physical acts which the second defendant has authorised.  The second
defendant has obtained a consent
from the Newcastle City Council to convert Lot
9 into two three-bedroom dwellings.  It would seem that the second defendant is
quite
keen to have its two new dwelling units connected to the rest of the
building so that its tenants or purchasers can enter the building
and their
units from Stevenson Place via the lobby on Level 3.  The remaining unit
holders would appear to be completely opposed
to this and are anxious that
there be no access to their units from the park via Level 1for security
reasons.  I do not have to make
any judgment on this matter.  I merely note it
for the purpose of background to the dispute.  It would seem that the present
dispute
has arisen because the defendants consider that strict adherence to
their rights with respect to the use of the right of way may
improve their
bargaining position on what appears to be their main objective.
<P>

8	Again by way of background in a matter which really does not affect the
decision I have to make, the lift is inspected periodically
by WorkCover.
WorkCover requires, and there are regulations to enforce its requirements, that
it have lighted access to the lift
shaft.  If this is not provided then
WorkCover may order that the lift be shut down.  As some of the inhabitants of
the units appear
to be elderly people, the non-provision of a lift will
severely inconvenience them, and in any event, the resale value of the units
will decrease.  
<P>

9	There is some natural lighting during daylight hours to the right of footway.
There have been some allegations that the defendants
have erected black plastic
over the windows to reduce this amount of light, which has been done quite
effectively.  The defendants
say that this is irrelevant to the present
dispute, and they may well be right.  However, it should be noted that the
owner of the
dominant land must not so use his or her land where he or she
would have reasonable grounds for believing that such use would affect
the
enjoyment of the easement:  <b>Du Plessis Estates Ltd v South African Railways
and Harbours [</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1933%5d%20EDL%20140" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1933] EDL 140</a>, 167. 
<P>

10	If a right of way is lit at the time of the grant, or if plans of a building
to be built show windows that will light it, the
servient owner may not cover
the apertures admitting the light, at least without providing alternative
lighting of equal luminosity:
 <b>Atkins v Bordman </b>2 Metcalf 457 (Mass)
conveniently found in  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281841%29%2037%20Am%20Dec%20100" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1841) 37 Am Dec 100</a>, 113.
<P>

11	The defendants say in any event that there is not sufficient lighting of the
exterior of the building or the means of access
from the park so that no matter
what the decision in the present case, WorkCover's regulations will not be
complied with.  Moreover,
they further say that as there is no plan of
management for the park, there is no way in which exterior lighting can be
erected.
 There are two lights outside the building on the parkland side at the
moment, but it is not quite clear as to whether these are
sufficient for
WorkCover's requirements.  I merely note these matters:  I do not really
consider that they are necessary to deal
with in these reasons.
<P>

12	I do not need to deal with all the past machinations.  Suffice it to say
that there are three fluorescent light fittings after
the right of footway
makes its 90 degree turn, which were installed by the plaintiffs, the power for
which comes from the common
property on Level 3 where the switches are located.
At some time in the past the first defendant has removed these tubes.  However,
they have been restored and the status quo pending giving these reasons has
been preserved by interim orders.
<P>

13	The basal question is whether the plaintiffs are entitled to have the right
of footway lit.
<P>

14	Before dealing with that matter, I need to briefly note the previous
proceedings there have been between the parties before the
Strata Schemes
Adjudicator and on appeal to the Strata Schemes Board.
<P>

15	On 19 September 1997, the plaintiffs applied for an order that the owner of
Lot 9 desist from interference with the common property
and be required
immediately to reinstate a concrete floor pad  outside the lift motor room and
the lighting within the right of footway.
 The Adjudicator dismissed that
application because he said it was misconceived.  The Adjudicator found that
the right of footway
"giving a right to pass from outside the parcel to the
common property located within Lot 9 was not common property."  He found that
the concrete brick pad was a layer of bricks covered with concrete laid upon
sand which lay on top of the floor surface of Lot 9
and that it was therefore
part of Lot 9 and was not common property.  He found that the light fittings
were within the air space
of Lot 9 and did not constitute common property.  He
did not accept the submission that because the power was supplied from the
house
supply and the Owners' Corporation met the costs of the power supply,
that the light fittings above the right of footway were common
property.
<P>

16	On appeal, the second defendant was ordered to restore the ramp and pad
outside the lift access room which it has done;  the
appeal was otherwise
dismissed.  
<P>

17	The Board held that the submission on behalf of the plaintiffs that whilst
the lights were not themselves common property they
were amenities which were
essential to give effect to or facilitate the enjoyment of the right of the
right of way was one which
was not within the jurisdiction of the Board to
determine and was a matter for the court.   Other arguments put so far as the
lights
were concerned were in the opinion of the Board, correctly decided by
the Adjudicator.  The Board held that the light and light fittings
are within
the air space of Lot 9 and form part of Lot 9;  therefore it refused an order
that the respondent reinstate the lighting.
<P>

18	The present summons was issued on 19 March 1999.  It was amended on 23 April
1999 to seek a declaration "That it is an implied
incident of the right of
footway appurtenant to the land in Certificate of Title CP/SP48754 and
burdening Lot  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=9%20SP%2048754" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">9 SP 48754</a> that the plaintiffs shall have the right to install
and maintain such artificial lighting as is necessary to illuminate the right
of footway to render it safely trafficable".  An injunction was also sought to
prevent interference with such lighting.
<P>

19	I heard the matter in Sydney on 6 May 1999.  Mr P Walsh of counsel appeared
for the plaintiffs and Mr G C Lindsay SC and Ms A
Silink appeared for the
defendants. The evidence finished during the morning and on the afternoon a
view was held of the building
and its environs in Newcastle.  Thereafter the
parties submitted written submissions, the last being received on 7 June
1999.
<P>

20	The defendants submitted that the plaintiffs were bound by an issue estoppel
to accept that the light and light fittings located
in the vicinity of the
easement formed part of Lot 9 and not part of the common property.  That may
well be right, but it does not
seem to me that it gets anyone anywhere.  The
real question is whether it is incident to the right of footway that the
plaintiffs
may have it lit, a matter which the Strata Schemes Board rightly
considered was not within its jurisdiction.
<P>

21	There is, at least at first blush, clear authority in favour of the
plaintiffs' proposition, <b>Mt Holyoke Realty Corporation v Holyoke Realty
Corporation </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281935%29%20198%20NE%20242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1935) 198 NE 242</a>;  101 Am LR 1289, a decision first discovered
by the industry of the Equity Division's researcher, Ms Angela Seward.  In that
case,
the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that a person having an
easement in the stairways and halls in another's building which
were
artificially lighted when the easement was acquired has a right to install and
use electric lights for which he supplies the
current.
<P>

22	In the present case it has been submitted by the defendants that the right
of light is an easement that must be granted and there
are no ancient lights
rights still existing in NSW.  The same sort of argument was put up and
rejected by the Massachusetts Court
and I do not need to repeat its reasoning,
with which I entirely agree.  The court merely said at Am LR p 1291 "This
argument is
not applicable to the facts of this case."  The court said at Am LR
p 1292, "The defendant does not seek, and the final decree does
not command,
that the plaintiff either maintain electric light fixtures or supply electric
current.  The defendant's right is supported
by the general rule that an owner
of an easement has a right to go upon the servient land to do acts reasonably
necessary for a proper
use and enjoyment of the easement.  (Authorities
omitted).  In the case at bar it seems that the right to go on to the
plaintiff's
premises, restore the electric fixtures and cause a current of
electricity to pass to the bulbs is reasonably necessary to the proper
enjoyment of the easement." 
<P>

23	Mr Lindsay SC and Ms Silink submit that, properly analysed, the <b>Mt
Holyoke case </b>does not assist the plaintiff.  They submit that, in order to
understand the decision, one must go back to the earlier decision in
a case
between the same parties reported in  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281933%29%20187%20NE%20227" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1933) 187 NE 227.</a>  They point out that
the <b>Mt Holyoke case</b> concerned an easement of necessity not an express
grant.  The Massachusetts Court was thus concerned with a necessity incidental
upon a necessity.  However, this is a distinction without a difference.  In
theory all easements derive from a grant, express, implied
or presumed. The
fact that one implies a grant from reasonable necessity (as in <b>Wheeldon v
Burrows </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281879%29%2012%20Ch%20D%2031" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1879) 12 Ch D 31</a>, not of course, an easement of necessity strictly
so called) does not affect the notional derivation of the easement.
<P>

24	Then counsel for the defendants say, " Upon the assumption...that the court
could properly ignore the fact that it is dealing
with an express as distinct
from an implied easement, the terms of the <b>Holyoke</b> easement are
different from the terms of the easement under consideration in these
proceedings and the differences are significant."
 As to this, I say, first,
that I did not appreciate the implied slur that if I rejected the defendants'
first submission, I would
be "ignoring" something significant.  Secondly, there
are, of course, differences, but I fail to understand how they are significant.
In each case, the real question was whether the person having a right of way
was entitled to light it.
<P>

25	Then it is put that the American law as to secondary easements is different
from the law of New South Wales on easements of necessity.
Whether this is so
or not, is quite immaterial. The easement in question is the subject of a grant
and the question really is what
ancillary rights appertain to it.
<P>

26	When answering this question, one of course looks at the words of the grant.
However, one does not stop there. It does not matter
how explicit those words
are, there may always be some ancillary right that was not considered at the
time of the grant, but which,
in hindsight, a reasonable bystander would have
considered was ancillary. "There are many easements which depend...not upon the
terms
of the grant but upon the circumstances under which the grant was made",
<b>Keewatin Power Co Ltd v Lake of the Woods Milling Co Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1930%5d%20AC%20640" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1930] AC 640</a>,
655 applying what Lord Parker said in <b>Pwllbach Colliery Co Ltd v Woodman
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1915%5d%20AC%20634" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1915] AC 634</a>, 646.  Thus the right to have water flow into a dam carries
with it the right to remove silt:  <b>Bloemfontein TC v Richter </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1938%5d%20AD%20195" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1938] AD
195</a>, 227.
<P>

27	The test for an ancillary right is set out in the 15th edition of
<b>Gale</b> <b>on Easements</b> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 1986) p 45, "The
grant of an easement is also the grant of such ancillary rights as are
reasonably
necessary to its exercise or enjoyment."  See to the same effect the
3rd edition of  Butt, <b>Land Law</b> (LBC, Sydney, 1996) p 447.  The authority
for this statement is <b>Jones v Pritchard </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1908%5d%201%20Ch%20630" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1908] 1 Ch 630</a>, 638.  In<b>
Auerbach v Beck </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%206%20NSWLR%20424" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 6 NSWLR 424</a>, 444,<b> </b>Powell J said, "...it is
open to the court to imply into a conveyance or demise the grant of such rights
as are absolutely necessary
to the enjoyment of the subject matter of the
conveyance or demise, or of such rights as are reasonably necessary for the use
and
enjoyment, in the way contemplated by the parties in the conveyance or
demise, of the subject matter of the conveyance or demise."
(This decision was
affirmed by the Court of Appeal  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%206%20NSWLR%20454" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 6 NSWLR 454</a> without further comment on
this point).
<P>

28	In <b>White v Taylor (No 2) </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%201%20Ch%20160" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] 1 Ch 160</a>,196, Buckley J said,
"...where the right claimed is necessary for the enjoyment of some other right
expressly granted, a grant of
the former right will be implied....Necessity,
for this purpose means reasonable necessity." 
<P>

29	In <b>Phillips v Low </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1892%5d%201%20Ch%2047" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1892] 1 Ch 47</a>, 50, Chitty J dealt with the case of
a conveyance of land with a house on it whose window looked onto other land of
the vendor. 
He held that there was an implied ancillary right that the window
would not be obscured by act of the vendor. He quoted the judgment
of Twysden
and Wyndham JJ in the Kings Bench in <b>Palmer v Fletcher</b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1793/1117.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1793] EngR 1117</a>; (1664) 1 Lev 122;
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=83%20ER%20329" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">83 ER 329</a> that "..the lights are a necessary and essential part of the house"
and said, "In other words, what is conveyed is not a mere brick
or stone
building with apertures called windows, but a house with windows enjoying
light.  This is the broad, substantial reason
which commends itself at once to
the common sense of mankind."
<P>

30	Another approach to this problem which produces the same result is to say
that there is a derogation from the grant of the easement
if an ancillary right
which a reasonable bystander would have expected to have passed with the grant
is denied; see eg <b>Lyttleton Times Co Ltd v Warners Ltd </b><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1907/1907_47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1907] UKPC 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1907%5d%20AC%20476" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1907] AC 476</a>,
481 (PC).
<P>

31	Counsel for the defendants point to the fact that in the Australian book on
easements by Bradbrook &amp; Neave <b>Easements and Restrictive Covenants in
Australia </b>(Butterworths, Sydney, 1981)  only three ancillary rights to a
right of way are noted and there is no mention of a right to light.
 The answer
to this submission is that it is always impossible to list exhaustively any set
of easements or ancillary rights. 
<P>

32	In the present case, there was an express grant of a right of way in what is
really a basement.  In my view that grant cannot
reasonably be used unless it
is illuminated.  The case thus falls within the <b>Pwllbach</b> principle.
<P>

33	Because reasonable necessity is all that is required, it is not helpful to
look to cases such as <b>Ray v Hazeldine </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1904%5d%202%20Ch%2017" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1904] 2 Ch 17</a>, 20 that state that
while a window or light in a room is essential to the comfortable enjoyment of
a room, as the room can be used
as a room without light, no easement of
necessity can be implied.   
<P>

34	The land in question in the instant case is <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act 1900</a> land but
the law clearly is that ancillary rights are held in respect of easements even
though the land is under the Torrens system
and even though the rights are not
spelt out in detail on the certificate of title:  <b>Hemmes Hermitage Pty Ltd v
Abdurahman </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2022%20NSWLR%20343" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 22 NSWLR 343.</a> 
<P>

35	However, counsel for the defendants submit that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssda1973344/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes (Freehold
Development) Act 1973</a> and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma1996242/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes Management Act 1996</a> preclude the
solution that would be applied to Old System land. This is said to be because
that legislation constrains a dominant
owner from modifying the property of the
servient owner without the latter's express consent.
<P>

36	I was not told the parts of the legislation that are said to have this
result.  Indeed section 8AB and Schedule 1B of the Freehold
Development Act
would tend to go in the other direction recognizing ancillary rights with
respect to rights of way for access.
<P>

37	It follows that the plaintiffs are entitled to the orders sought and also
that the defendants pay the costs of the proceedings.
<P>

38	I will, however, also reserve further consideration.  I will do this because
my view is that the defendants' submissions that
because there is no legal
entitlement to traverse public land to gain access to Lot 9 and there is no
right to have external lighting
the present order will not be sufficient to
allow the plaintiffs to have WorkCover service the lift.  As I say I think this
is irrelevant,
but  if there is a problem in this area, it may be necessary to
come back to the court and consider the defendants' alternative suggestions
that there be a variation of the Strata scheme under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssda1973344/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 51</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssda1973344/" class="autolink_findacts">Strata Schemes
(Freehold Development) Act 1973</a>.
