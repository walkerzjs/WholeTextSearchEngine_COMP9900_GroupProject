<P>

<b><u>COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA LIMITED  V.  NICK FRISINA PTY. LIMITED
&amp; ORS.</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT (On Orders)</u></b>
<P>

1  	I have heard argument on two matters in relation to orders which
the Bank submits should be made arising out of the judgment
which I gave on 2nd
September 1999.
<P>

2  	Mr. Raphael for the first, second and third defendants has
submitted that I should not make an order that his clients pay the
costs of the
separate determination.  He submitted that costs were wasted on his side,
because the Bank did not concede prior to
the hearing of the case that the
purported appointment of the new trustee was ineffectual or that the first
defendant never validly
became the trustee of the relevant trust.  He submitted
that a substantial part of the written submissions he prepared was directed
to
those issues, and that time and the associated costs were wasted.  He also
submitted that the parties he represented had some
success in relation to the
matters argued, including s.66B of the Conveyancing Act.  However, he conceded
that prior to the hearing,
the Bank had not explicitly advised that it
contested the two points which it ultimately conceded, and he also conceded
that there
was no enquiry made of the Bank whether or not it did concede those
two points.
<P>

3  	Mr. Forster submitted that the Bank had substantial success on
all points argued, and that the whole of Mr. Raphael's submissions
would have
failed in any event by reason of the jus tertii point, but for the application
made on the day of the hearing to have
the matter argued on behalf of the
trust.
<P>

4  	In my opinion, the points raised by Mr. Raphael do not justify
departing from the ordinary order as to costs, and I would propose
to order
that the first, second and third defendants pay the Bank's costs of the
separate determination.
<P>

5  	Mr. Raphael also submitted that the time proposed by the
plaintiff for the execution of the judgment for possession, that is
9th October
1999, was insufficient.  However, he did not lead any evidence concerning any
difficulties that would be caused by execution
of the judgment at that time,
nor of any particular advantage that would be given by postponing it for some
time after that date.
<P>

6  	For that reason, I am minded to make the orders as proposed by
the plaintiff, subject to an application that has been made this
morning by Mr.
Diethelm on behalf of the fourth defendant.
<P>

7  	The fourth defendant is a beneficiary of the relevant trust.  Mr.
Diethelm tells me that it is proposed to lead evidence that
money advanced by
the Bank was misapplied, and that there has been consequential loss to the
trust and the beneficiaries.  He submits
for that reason, the beneficiaries
(and in particular, his client the fourth defendant) should be given an
opportunity to lead that
evidence before judgment for possession is given in
favour of the Bank.  He submitted that the questions concerning possession have
not been determined against his client, and that his client should be given an
opportunity to contest these matters.
<P>

8  	As I indicated during argument, in my opinion that submission
overlooks the way in which this case has proceeded.  Some time
ago, an order
was made for separate determination of the issues between the Bank and the
first defendant.  Quite plainly, the principal
issue to be determined between
those parties was whether the Bank was entitled to possession of the
properties.  According to the
pleadings, the only parties concerned in that
issue were the plaintiff and the first defendant.  The other defendants raised
no defence
to the claim for possession.  Quite plainly, it was contemplated by
the order for separate determination that the Court would finally
determine all
matters going to the Bank's entitlement to possession.  If the beneficiaries,
and in particular the fourth defendant,
are now to be permitted to raise
matters challenging the Bank's right to possession, it is plain in my opinion
that they will have
to make out a case by evidence which explains why they have
not raised this matter earlier and why they permitted the matter to go
for
separate determination, and also they will have to show a prima facie case that
the Bank is not entitled to possession.  
<P>

9  	In my opinion, what they would need to do in the first instance
is to make out a case similar to that required for an interlocutory
injunction;
that is, not only make out some sort of prima facie case, but also show that
the balance of convenience favours the Bank
being prevented from having
possession until the final determination of the issues they wish to raise.  The
way I see that at present,
it would require prima facie evidence that a
particular amount of the advances of the Bank was lost to the trust, payment of
the
balance to the Bank, evidence that the properties in question have a
particular value to the trust or the beneficiaries over and
above their money
value, and provision for payment of future interest as it accrues.
<P>

10  	What I propose to do is to make the orders sought by the Bank,
but order that they be stayed and also not entered until and
including 22nd
September 1999; direct that on or before 20th September 1999, the fourth
defendant serve all material it wishes to
rely on on the Bank; and stand the
matter over before me at 9.30am on 22nd September 1999.  On that day, I would
consider whether
the material produced by the fourth defendant is sufficient to
justify a substantial interlocutory hearing, and if it is, I would
appoint a
later time before me for such a hearing.
<P>

11  	For those reasons, I make the orders in the Short Minutes of
Order which I initial and date.
<P>

12  	I stay Orders 1, 3, 4 and 5 until and including 22nd September
1999, and I direct that they not be entered until after 22nd
September 1999.

<P>

13  	I stand the matter over before me at 9.30am on 22nd September
1999.
