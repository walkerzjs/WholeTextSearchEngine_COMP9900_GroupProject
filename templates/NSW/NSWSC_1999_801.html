<b>1082/96	MICHAEL CAMPBELL LOWE v BARRY ARTHUR LANG  and EROLGREEN PTY
LIMITED</b>
<P>

 
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1   	In this matter the following question has been asked of in
re-examination of the plaintiff Michael Lowe: 
<P>

"In the period from 30 October through to November and December 1991,  do you
recall telling any person about the conversation or
the matters discussed in
the conversation with Barry Lang on 30 October 1991?"
<P>

It has been objected to.  The way in which the matter arise arises is as
follows.  The crux of the case is a conversation which
occurred on 30 October
1991 in which Mr Lowe says, but the defendant Barry Lang denies, that Mr Lang
made an offer to pay part of
the royalties to Mr Lowe if a quarry were
established on the Lang's property ("the October conversation").  In
cross-examination
of Mr Lowe, Mr Deakin of Queen's Counsel for the defendants,
put to him that at a considerably later time he heard discussions about
royalties from the quarry with certain neighbouring landowners and that he had
not thought of royalties before hearing that later
conversation.  There is no
doubt in my mind that that amounted to a challenge to Mr Lowe that he had
fabricated his version of the
vital October conversation.  On the surface of
it, it seems to me that that the contentious question in re-examination,
obviously
designed to elicit from the witness prior statements consistent with
his account of the October conversation, did arise from cross-examination.
<P>

2   	Mr Deakin QC has submitted that this is not so, and that
these this question, if to be asked at all, ought have been asked
in chief.  He
says that that is so because it has been plain from the start of the case that
it was denied that the October conversation
contained any mention of royalties.
Some prior statements made by the plaintiff consistent with his version of the
October conversation
have in fact been put in in evidence in chief.  Some of
those statements made by the plaintiff were deposed to by other witnesses,
but
one at least has been deposed to by the plaintiff himself.  Those statements I
admitted through the exception contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 64(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>
("the Act"), without direct adversion to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 108.</a>  I should say that, in view of
the ruling I am about to give on this question in re-examination, those
statements by the plaintiff
already in evidence, were they in truth not
admissible at the time and on the basis on which I admitted them, they would
now be admissible
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 108.</a>
<P>

3   	Returning to the question that I am now dealing with, it
seems to me that, even if it were earlier implicit in the way the
case was
conducted, that the October conversation had not contained the vital matter
which Mr Lowe asserts, and Mr Lang denies, and
that Mr Lowe was wrong in his
evidence, which ought not be accepted, in my view that does not prevent the
direct challenge put to
him in cross-examination being an assertion of
fabrication by him and having effect as such in relation to the admissibility
of evidence.
<P>

4   	It seems to me that this has two effects in that regard.
The first is, I have recently indicated in a judgment delivered by
me in
<b>Drabsch v Switzerland General Insurance Co Ltd</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/765.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 765</a> that a
broad approach should be taken to the matter allowable in re-examination, under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s39.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 39</a> of the Act as at common law, on the basis of the authorities that I
collected in that judgment.  It seems to me that the contentious
question is
clearly admissible in re-examination under those principles; see particularly
<b>Wojcic v Incorporated Nominal Defendant</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%20VR%20263" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] VR 263.</a>  Any possibility
that it should be rejected under the rule in s 105 of the Act prohibiting
evidence going to credibility only is
removed by the provision of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 108(1)</a> if
the evidence falls within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 108(1)</a> it may be asked without the leave of the
Court, as at common law.  In my view, therefore, the question is admissible in
re-examination
without leave.
<P>

5   	If, however, I am wrong about that, the second consequence
flowing from <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 108</a> is that the question is admissible under the rule set out in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 108(3)(b).</a>  In the view that I have already expressed, there was a direct
suggestion of fabrication in the question asked in cross-examination.
 I do not
think it much matters whether or not a suggestion of fabrication or
reconstruction was implicit in the way the case was
previously conducted.
Cross examining counsel put directly to the witness an allegation amounting to
an allegation of fabrication.
 If I am wrong with the question's admissibility
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 108(1)</a> I should come to exercise the discretion conferred on the Court
by the direct suggestion of fabrication that I have mentioned.  If
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 108(3)</a>
applies, I would give leave to adduce in re-examination the evidence of the
prior consistent statement.  For the reasons that I have
given the question is
allowed.
