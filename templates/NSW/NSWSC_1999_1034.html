<b>4161/99 - KWOK FU SHING v DAVID LY TIEN (THIEN) THANG &amp; 1 OR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (EX TEMPORE)</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff is a pop star well known in
Chinese-speaking communities as Aaron Kwok.  He has won many prizes and
is a
celebrity.  He toured Australia in April 1999, staying at the Sydney Casino
Hotel and subsequently, a hotel in Melbourne.
<P>

2  	After a performance in Sydney he met the defendants in a lounge
at his hotel.  The second defendant introduced the first defendant
as her
`sworn younger brother'.  The evidence indicates that both defendants reside in
New South Wales.
<P>

3  	The plaintiff struck up an immediate friendship with the second
defendant and had conversations with her including a three hour
telephone call
before he left for Melbourne.  When he told her that he was flying to
Melbourne, she suggested that she meet him there
and he agreed.
<P>

4  	On 5 April 1999, the day upon which he was due to return to Hong
Kong, he and the second defendant were in contact and she invited
him to her
hotel room to `have a chat'.  His evidence is that after entering the hotel
room he talked with the second defendant.
 He could not see anyone else in the
room and noticed nothing unusual.  The second defendant gave him a teddy bear
as a gift.  He
said they then embraced, touched and kissed each other
intimately, but they did not remove their clothing.  He stayed in the hotel
room for about 45 minutes.
<P>

5  	They were interrupted by a phone call, evidently from the first
defendant.  After that call the second defendant told the plaintiff
that the
first defendant was her boyfriend.  The plaintiff says he was confused and
upset, and felt he had been cheated, and that
he said to her `You are
completely free.  You have the right to choose a boyfriend'.
<P>

6  	The plaintiff left the room and encountered the first defendant
outside the room.  They had a conversation in which he said,
`I don't want to
be a third party in a relationship'.   The plaintiff says that when he went to
the second defendant's hotel room
he believed that the second defendant would
not reveal their intimate discussions and conduct to anyone and they would be
alone.
<P>

7  	On 2 September 1999 a reporter from the Oriental Daily in Hong
Kong called the plaintiff's manager, Leung May-May, telling her
that he had
been approached to purchase a videotape showing a meeting of the plaintiff and
a girl in an Australian hotel room, and
that the price would be AUD 20,000.
The reporter went to Sydney and viewed the videotape, but did not buy it.
<P>

8  	On 3 September 1999 an article appeared in the Oriental Daily.
An English translation is in evidence.  The headline  was `Aaron
Caught with
Girl in Australia Hotel Room'.  The article reported in some detail on the
contents of the tape. In particular, it said
as follows:
<P>

`The reporter then asked to see the playback.  The first tape showed Aaron's
trip in Australia and was dated 9/4/99. On seeing the
second tape, he confirmed
that the male in the video is Aaron Kwok.  With him is the long-haired girl.
Aaron was sitting on the sofa
with a soft toy by the side while the long-haired
girl was sitting on the bed.  They looked like any couple who is talking
intimately.
 Aaron later took off his shoes and socks, both looking extremely
comfortable.  Ten minutes later Aaron walked toward the bed and
sat side by
side with the girl. He looked at her and had his hands on her shoulder while he
talked.  Aaron was seen as gentlemanly
and there was no indecency.  Aaron also
touched her hair and rested his head on her stomach.  Aaron was also reported
as kissing
the girl on the face and mouth, touching her breasts and thighs.
After they started to embrace they danced.  Later they left the
room
together.'
<P>

9  	Subsequently, reporters told Ms Leung that the man who wished to
sell the video was planning to sell it to Asian Television
Limited or publish
it on the Internet.  Ms Leung told the plaintiff that this would destroy his
name and reputation completely. 
There followed protracted negotiations between
Ms Leung and the seller, eventually identified by her as `David', and asserted
by
the plaintiff to be the first defendant.  I regard it as likely on the
balance of probabilities, on the evidence before me, that
this is true.  
<P>

10  	David asked for a big press conference in Hong Kong in which the
plaintiff would `apologise' to him, and also asked for an
escalating amount of
cash, which by 27 September 1999 had become USD 1 million, for the destruction
of the tape.  No agreement was
reached.  David insisted that the police not be
contacted, but in fact they were approached by Ms Leung and investigations were
conducted
in Hong Kong and Sydney. 
<P>

11  	Somewhat inconsistently with his offer to destroy the videotape
for money, David said he wanted to destroy the plaintiff's
name and reputation
completely, and to punish him and to teach him a lesson.
<P>

12  	The evidence shows that New South Wales and Victorian police
conducted investigations into the matter in September 1999, liaising
with the
Hong Kong police.  The Hong Kong police urged Ms Leung to persuade David to
come to Hong Kong so they could arrest him.
 He agreed to meet her in Hong Kong
but later he changed his plans.  The defendants were interviewed by the New
South Wales police
in Sydney on 30 September 1999, but they asserted their
right to remain silent and no charges were laid.
<P>

13  	The plaintiff says that he is very distressed about David's
phone calls, and that in his experience of the Chinese pop music
industry a
wholesome, clean public image and reputation are extremely important for
success.  He says that should a video recording
of his meeting with the second
defendant in her hotel room be made available to the public, he would suffer
great damage to his reputation
and career, both in Hong Kong and around the
world.  Ms Leung agrees.  There is no other evidence on this subject.  It  may
appear
implausible to a Western mind that such damage would flow from
publication of the tape, given the newspaper article published in
Hong Kong on
3 September and the evidence as to what actually occurred in the hotel room.
However, it is appropriate to infer from
the only evidence before the Court
that to a Chinese mind the matter would be viewed differently and, on that
basis, I accept the
plaintiff's evidence.
<P>

<b>The Proceedings</b>
<P>

14  	The Statement of Claim filed on 30 September 1999, an amendment
to which was foreshadowed at yesterday's hearing, seeks relief
on five
grounds.
<P>

15  	First, it is alleged that the defendants committed a breach of
confidence, on the basis that the second defendant's invitation
to the
plaintiff to visit her hotel room, to the knowledge of the first defendant,
implied an occasion of confidential communication
between them, and the making
of the videotape and the threatened dissemination of it to the media would
constitute an actionable
breach of that duty.
<P>

16  	Secondly, the plaintiff alleges deceit, on the basis that there
was an implied representation of privacy by the second defendant
when she
invited the plaintiff to her hotel room, to the knowledge of the first
defendant, and that the steps taken by them to arrange
for the video-taping of
the encounter were conscious and fraudulent steps, and that the plaintiff has
suffered or will suffer damage.
<P>

17  	Thirdly, the plaintiff relies on what his counsel calls  `the
innominate tort of intentional and wilful action designed to
make financial
gain for the defendants at the expense of the plaintiff'.
<P>

18  	Fourthly, the plaintiff relies on the Court's jurisdiction,
limited though it may be, to grant an injunction to restrain the
commission of
an offence.  In this case the offence is under the<b> </b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/lda1969181/" class="autolink_findacts">Listening Devices
Act</i> 1969</a> (Vic) which, though subsequently repealed, was in force at the
relevant time.  Section 4 of that Act states that a person shall not
use any
listening device to record any private conversation to which he is not a party,
nor communicate the substance of any private
conversation recorded by the use
of a listening device, without the express or implied consent of the parties to
the private conversation.
 Section 7 states that where a record of a private
conversation recorded by the use of a listening device is made by a person who
is not a party to the private conversation, then (relevantly) the person must
forthwith destroy the record.
<P>

19  	Fifthly, the plaintiff says that the threats made by the first
defendant, to the knowledge of the second defendant, to release
the tape if he
did not make a substantial payment constituted the tort of intimidation.  R P
Balkin and J L R Davis <i>Law of Torts</i> (2nd ed, 1996) say (at 618):
<P>

`The essence of the tort of intimidation is that the defendant has, by threat
to commit an unlawful act, coerced another person
into acting in a way in which
the latter did not wish to act, the defendants having thereby intended and
caused economic damage to
the plaintiff.'
<P>

The plaintiff says that the acts where unlawful because they  were tortious and
in breach of confidence.
<P>

20  	By Notice of Motion filed on 30 September 1999 the plaintiff
sought orders of three kinds, namely, an interlocutory injunction
to restrain
copying or dealing with the videotape; an order for delivery of all copies of
the videotape in the defendants' possession;
and an order for disclosure by
affidavit of whether there are copies and where they are.
<P>

21  	On that day I made an ex parte order granting relief of the
first kind, namely, an ex parte injunction to restrain the defendants
from
copying and dealing with the videotape. When the matter returned to me
yesterday after the defendants had appeared on the previous
day and I had
granted a short adjournment, the plaintiff sought continuation of the
injunction and orders for disclosure of the existence
and location of all
copies of the videotape, subject to arrangements to permit the defendants to
assert their privilege against self-incrimination.
 The defendants opposed the
granting of further relief of either kind.  These are the applications with
which I must now deal.
<P>

<b>Questions for Determination in an Interlocutory Application</b>
<P>

22  	As I shall show, this application involves some unsettled law as
well as disputed facts.  In such a case, McLelland J's observations
in
<i>Kolback Securities v Epoch Mining NL</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%20533" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 8 NSWLR 533</a>, 535 are
helpful.  His Honour said:
<P>

`Where a plaintiff's entitlement to ultimate relief is uncertain, the Court, in
deciding to grant or refuse an interlocutory injunction,
must consider what
course is best calculated to achieve justice between the parties in the
circumstances of the particular case,
pending the resolution of the
uncertainty, bearing in mind the consequences to the defendant of the grant of
an injunction in support
of relief to which the plaintiff may ultimately be
held not to be entitled, and the consequences to the plaintiff of the refusal
of an injunction in support of relief to which the plaintiff may ultimately be
held to be entitled... Where the uncertainty depends
in whole or in part on a
contested question of fact it is not appropriate for the Court to decide that
question on the interlocutory
application.  Where the uncertainty depends in
whole or in part on a contested question of law, it may or may not be
appropriate
for the Court to decide that question on the interlocutory
application, depending on circumstances, eg, whether the question is novel
or
difficult, or is susceptible of resolution on the present state of the
evidence, or whether the urgency of the matter renders
it impracticable to give
proper consideration to the question...Unless the plaintiff shows that there is
at least a serious question
to be tried which if resolved in its favour would
entitle it to final relief, then the requirements of justice as between the
parties
will dictate that an interlocutory injunction should be refused.'
<P>

23  	In the present case it would be unwise for me to determine
unsettled questions of law given the limited time which has been
available for
argument and consideration of the issues. I shall assess the legal issues as
part of my determination of the question
whether there is a serious question to
be  tried.
<P>

24  	As to the second matter to be considered on an interlocutory
application, namely, what is sometimes called `the balance of
convenience', Sir
John Donaldson MR made some pertinent observations in a case, the facts of
which were not entirely dissimilar from
the present case.  In <i>Francome v
Mirror Group Newspapers</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20WLR%20892" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 WLR 892</a>, 898 his Lordship said:
<P>

`It is sometimes said that this involves a weighing of the balance of
convenience.  This is an unfortunate expression. Our business
is justice, not
convenience.  We can and must disregard  fanciful claims by either party.
Subject to that, we must contemplate the
possibility that either party may
succeed and must do our best to ensure that nothing occurs pending the trial
which will prejudice
his rights. Since the parties are usually asserting wholly
inconsistent claims, this is difficult, but we have to do our best.  In
so
doing, we are seeking a balance of justice, not of convenience.'
<P>

25  	In the present case I must balance the position of the
defendants if they are left to rely upon the plaintiff's undertaking
as to
damages against the risk to the plaintiff if relief is not granted.  The
application of that balance must be made both to the
continuation of the
injunction and to the disclosure order. On both matters it is relevant that
there is no suggestion that the plaintiff
would be unable to make good his
undertaking as to damages if it is validly called upon - indeed, the evidence
indicates he will
be well able to do so - and also relevant that on the only
evidence before the Court, dissemination of the videotape would cause
substantial damage to him.
<P>

<b>The Defendants' Submissions</b>
<P>

26  	The defendants' first submission is that the plaintiff's
essential complaint was as to invasion of privacy.  They say that
the claim
based on breach of confidence was faulty for a number of reasons.  One was that
there was no significant or reliable evidence
of any relationship between the
plaintiff and the second defendant apart from the plaintiff's own affidavit,
and that affidavit indicates
that the relationship was a transitory one which
had not been established in any significant way before the incident in the
hotel
room occurred.  That incident, say the defendants, is merely a `kiss and
tell story'.  They submit that the substance of the video
is not revealing or
damaging.
<P>

27  	They say that cases on breach of confidence normally concern
trade secrets or commercial information, and cases involving private
relationships, to the extent that they apply the doctrine of the breach of
confidence, are distinguishable from the present facts
because of absence here
of any longstanding relationship of the kind which would import an obligation
of confidence.
<P>

28  	The defendants say that the plaintiff was simply naive to
believe there was any obligation of confidence on the second defendant's
part.
Further, the defendants say that any possible obligation of confidence was
destroyed by the public dissemination of the information
of the contents of
the videotape in the newspaper article of 3 September 1999.
<P>

29  	Remembering that my task today is simply to address whether
there is a serious question to be tried and the balance of convenience,
I
reject the defendants' submissions as to breach of confidence.  In the first
place, my finding of fact as to the risk of damage
to the plaintiff implies
that I cannot dismiss the incident as merely a `kiss and tell story'.  Nor can
I conclude that, because
the substance of the video does not appear to be
particularly embarrassing or revealing, the plaintiff has no legitimate
complaint
on the ground that its disclosure breaches a confidence.
<P>

30  	I reject the submission that the law of breach of confidence
requires, where the relationship is a private rather than a commercial
one,
that the relationship must be longstanding in order to import something of
confidentiality.  Naturally enough, if the relationship
is longstanding and
intimate the prospects of importing the requisite obligation are enhanced, but
even a fresh, short-lived relationship
can cause the obligation to arise.
<P>

31  	In<b> </b><i>Hellewell v The Chief Constable of Derbyshire</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%204%20All%20ER%20473" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 4 All ER 473</a>, 476 Laws J said that he entertained no doubt that
disclosure of a photograph may, in some circumstances, be actionable as a
breach
of confidence.  He said that if someone with a telephoto lens were to
take from a distance and with no authority a picture of another
engaged in some
private act, his subsequent disclosure of the photograph would as surely amount
to a breach of confidence as if he
had found or stolen a letter or diary in
which the act was recounted and proceeded to publish it.
<P>

32  	It is not necessary for me to adjudicate on whether his
Lordship's expression of legal opinion requires some qualification.
 It is
sufficient to say that there is a plausible ground for the plaintiff's
contention.
<P>

33  	Finally, as to the contention that publication of an account of
the contents of a videotape in a Hong Kong newspaper destroyed
any obligation
of confidentiality, I refer to the chapter by Ms Jennifer Stuckey-Clarke in
Patrick Parkinson (ed), <i>The Principles of Equity</i> (1996) at 436-437 and
the cases there cited.  Where information has been published on a
non-confidential basis generally, it cannot
be treated as confidential.  But a
prior transitory publication of information, which may not be remembered or
discovered by all
of those who would be interested in it, does not necessarily
defeat an obligation of confidentiality, where what is sought to be
restrained
is a more permanent and enduring form of disclosure.  Consequently, in my view,
the publication of a verbal account of
the contents of the videotape in Hong
Kong would not prevent the plaintiff from enjoining the defendants from making
the videotape
available for viewing in a public way such as by release on the
Internet.
<P>

34  	As to the claim based in deceit, the defendants submitted that
the plaintiff became aware of the first defendant's presence
immediately after
the meeting in the hotel room, and probably before, as a result of the
telephone conversation received by the second
defendant in the room.  The
defendants point out the plaintiff did not seek any assurance or say that he
felt compromised, but merely
said that he did not want to be a third party in a
relationship.
<P>

35  	While that is true, it seems to me that the crucial question in
the claim for deceit is whether there was an implied representation
made by the
second defendant with the authority of the first defendant at the time when the
plaintiff was invited in to the hotel
room.  If there was, his conduct at a
later stage cannot refute the existence of that invitation.  It seems to me
there was at least
a serious question to be tried on the question of deceit.
<P>

36  	The plaintiff does not, for the purposes of the present
application, rely upon the `innominate tort' or the Court's jurisdiction
to
restrain the Commission of a defence, but he does rely on the tort of
intimidation.
<P>

37  	The defendants say that there is no threat to commit an unlawful
act, but it seems to me to follow from my conclusion that
there is a serious
question to be tried as to breach of confidence and deceit, that there is also
a serious question to be tried
on the tort of intimidation, on the ground that
an act in breach of confidence or a tortious act is unlawful conduct for that
purpose.
 
<P>

38  	The defendants say that the plaintiff has not demonstrated any
proprietary or equitable interest in the videotape, and the
fact that he
appears in the videotape does not give him any right.  This may be so, but the
plaintiff's case as put to me is not
based upon the establishment of any
proprietary right or any equitable right arising out of the mere fact that the
plaintiff appeared
in the videotape.  The case is put on the more orthodox
ground that equity should intervene in support of the plaintiff's equitable
right to restrain a breach of confidence, and also in its auxiliary
jurisdiction equity should grant relief to restrain the commission
or
repetition of torts.
<P>

39  	The defendants also say that there has been substantial delay in
bringing these proceedings.  I disagree.  The evidence before
me explains that
the first defendant's attempt to extract money from the plaintiff began only in
September and the plaintiff appears
to have been assiduous in endeavouring to
deal with it in one way or another until, when other methods including criminal
proceedings
appeared not to be succeeding, he brought the present
proceedings.
<P>

40  	Finally, the defendants submit that I should draw an  adverse
inference from the fact that two reporters, who are specifically
referred to in
the evidence of Ms Leung, have not provided any evidence.  It seems to me that
in an interlocutory application of
this kind, it would be inappropriate for any
such adverse inference to be drawn.
<P>

41  	My conclusion, having regard to the balance of convenience, is
that it is appropriate for the injunction first ordered on 30
September 1999 to
be continued until further order.  Since there is some uncertainty as to the
identification of the hotel where
the encounter took place, I propose to amend
the injunction to show names of alternate venues which have been raised at the
hearing.
<P>

<b>Disclosure of the Existence and Whereabouts of the Videotape and Any
Copies</b>
<P>

42  	As I have indicated, the plaintiff seeks not only to continue
the injunction, but also to obtain an order for disclosure of
information about
the videotapes.  In draft short minutes of orders handed up by the plaintiff's
counsel it is proposed that I should
order that each of the defendants make,
file and serve an affidavit as to whether there are any copies of the videotape
in their
possession and similar matters, and if either of them wishes to
maintain a claim for privilege against self-incrimination then they
should
attend Court at a specified time so that the judge may consider the application
of s 128 of the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (NSW).
<P>

43  	An order of this kind appears to have been made by Einstein J on
13 August 1999 in <i>Menzies v Perkins </i>(No.2965/99), but his Honour's
reasons for judgment are not available to me.  In<b> </b><i>Bax Global
(Australia) Pty Ltd v Evans </i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/815.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 815</a> I investigated the practice of
the Equity Division in circumstances where a disclosure order is sought
ancillary to a Mareva order,
having regard to the possibility that the person
to whom the order is directed may wish to rely on the privilege against
self-incrimination.
 I indicated in that judgment that, in my opinion, the High
Court's decision in <i>Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20162%20ALR%20294" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 162 ALR 294</a>
implies that before making any Mareva order or any disclosure order ancillary
to it, the Court should consider what alternative forms
of order are
available.
<P>

44  	In the present case the application for disclosure order is not
ancillary to a Mareva order.  The purpose of the present application
is to
identify the location of all copies of the videotape.  One assumes that if the
plaintiff is successful in doing to, he will
then make an application for
delivery up of those copies, at least where they are in the possession of the
defendants.  The existence
and whereabouts of the videotapes are matters
closely related to the subject matter of the plaintiff's claims.
<P>

45  	This is not a case, as is typical with Mareva orders, where a
disclosure order is sought in order to protect the Court's process
from being
abused by a defendant who creates an apprehension of dissipating assets or
taking them out of the jurisdiction in a manner
which is likely to frustrate
the plaintiff's prospect of recovery of the proceeds of any judgment eventually
entered in the plaintiff's
favour.  In the present case the disclosure order is
closely related to the plaintiff's cause of action.
<P>

46  	That being to, there is an alternative form of relief available,
namely, the administration of interrogatories  under Pt 24
of the Supreme Court
Rules.  That interrogatories may be appropriate in the case before me seems to
me to be confirmed, broadly,
in<b> </b><i>RCA Corporation v Reddington Rare
Records</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%201%20WLR%201445" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] 1 WLR 1445</a>, where the order was for discovery.  Part 24 r 5
permits the Court at any stage of the proceedings to order a party to serve on
another
party a statement in accordance with r 6 in answer to specified
interrogatories referred to in the order, and permits the Court to
require that
the statement be verified by affidavit.  The advantage of proceeding under Pt
24 rather than under a less settled practice
of the kind which I described in
the<b> </b><i>Bax Global</i> case, is that the procedure for objecting on the
ground of the privilege is specifically regulated by Pt 24 r 6(3)(d) and r
6(4).
<P>

47  	It appears to me that I can, by making an order pursuant to the
provisions which I have mentioned, give the plaintiff the substance
of the
disclosure relief which he seeks in a manner which avoids any necessity for
further  judicial invention.
<P>

48  	If I were not to rely on Pt 24 it would be necessary for me to
decide whether it is better to follow what seems to me to have
emerged as the
equity practice, or to take the approach which the plaintiff urged upon me.
The plaintiff submitted that the equity
practice would put him at a
disadvantage because the Court would make the initial determination as to
whether there is reasonable
ground for the objection based on the privilege
without the benefit of informed submissions by the plaintiff's counsel.
<P>

49  	On the other hand, the procedure which the plaintiff wishes to
adopt would require the defendant to make a claim involving
difficult and
sophisticated legal principles from the witness box.  It seems to me that this
is asking a great deal of a lay defendant.
 I therefore prefer in all the
circumstances to proceed under Pt 24, since it is available in this case.
<P>

50  	I propose that if the plaintiff formulates specific
interrogatories designed to elicit the information referred to in paragraph
3
of the draft short minutes of order, I should make an order under Pt 24 r 5
directing the defendants to provide a verified statement
in accordance with r 6
in answer to those interrogatories.
<P>

51  	Although the normal timetable under r 2 requires that at least
14 days be given for an answer to interrogatories, it seems
to me that this
timetable assumes a different set of circumstances from the present, in which
pleadings have occurred and have been
closed, and the case is proceeding in the
normal way to trial.  Given that I expect the interrogatories in this case to
be quite
specific and of a kind not requiring substantial effort for answers to
be prepared, I would contemplate a much shorter timetable
in which the
interrogatories could be answered, say, four business days after they are
administered.
<P>

52  	I propose to stand the matter over to next Tuesday 12 October
1999 at 9.30am to permit any further argument with respect to
the form of
relief by way of administration of interrogatories and, in the meantime, I
direct the plaintiff to prepare draft interrogatories
and draft orders with
respect to paragraph 3.
<P>

53  	Since these reasons for judgment have been completed after 5
o'clock today, it has been necessary for me to interrupt the delivery
of my
reasons in order to make an order continuing the injunction until further
order, and I have done so.
<P>

54  	On the question of costs it seems to me the plaintiff has been
successful, and as at present advised I see no reason why the
costs of the
plaintiff's application should not follow the event.  However, I will hear any
submissions on the question of costs
on 12 October.
<P>
