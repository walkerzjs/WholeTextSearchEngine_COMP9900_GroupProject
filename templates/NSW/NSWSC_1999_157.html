<b>THE SUPREME COURT</b>
<P>

<b>OF NEW SOUTH WALES</b>
<P>

<b>ADMINISTRATIVE LAW DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>DUNFORD J</b>
<P>

<b>Friday 12 February 1999</b>
<P>

<center><b><u>30081/98  -  TIMOTHY KARMAS  -  AS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ESTATE
OF ELENI KARMAS &amp; 4 ORS  v</u>                             <u>NEW SOUTH
WALES LAND AND HOUSING CORP &amp; ANOR</u></b></center>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u> - </b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  This is an application by the Residential Tenancies
Tribunal for an order relating to a subpoena that has been directed to it on
behalf of the plaintiffs in the proceedings which are in substance an appeal by
the plaintiffs against a decision of the Residential
Tenancies Tribunal dated 7
July 1998 as amended by a notice dated 6 August 1998 and a number of
interlocutory rulings or orders by
the Tribunal.
<P>

2	The first defendant is the New South Wales Land and Housing Corporation which
was successful in the Tribunal in obtaining an order
for possession of certain
premises at 10 Anthony Street, Padstow, and the second defendant has filed a
submitting appearance.  
<P>

3	The subpoena seeks production of the complete file of the Tribunal in
relation to the relevant matter.  An affidavit by the acting
Registrar of the
Tribunal discloses that most of the documents referred to in the subpoena have
been produced without objection,
but a claim for public interest immunity is
made in respect of the balance contained in a confidential exhibit, and the
affidavit
discloses that each of the remaining documents is a note made by a
member of the Tribunal in the course of that person performing
the office of
member or is a note of that person's deliberations in acting as such member;
and that none of the documents not produced
is a minute of the Tribunal or a
written record of reasons given by a member for a decision of the Tribunal nor
constitutes published
reasons of a decision of the Tribunal.
<P>

4	The second defendant relies on the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 129</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s130.html" class="autolink_findacts">130</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence
Act 1995</a>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 129</a> provides that, subject to certain exceptions, evidence
of the reasons for a decision made by a person who is a judge in an Australian
or overseas proceeding or the deliberations of a person so acting in relation
to such decision must not be given, nor must such evidence
be given by
tendering as evidence a document prepared by such a person; and "judge" is
defined in the Dictionary to the Act as "the
judge, magistrate or other person
before whom the proceeding is being held".
<P>

5	Section 82 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/rta1987207/" class="autolink_findacts">Residential Tenancies Act 1987</a> confers on  members of the
Tribunal in the exercise of the functions of a member the same protection and
immunity as a justice in
the exercise of the functions of a justice under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a>.
<P>

6	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 129(5)(c)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> provides an exception in respect
of an appeal from or judicial review of a decree, order or sentence of the
court.  It has long been
established that although the formal act or orders of
a judge or court can be proved when an appropriate occasion arises, such as
in
the circumstances referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 129(5)</a>, no evidence can be given or can be
required to be given of the thought processes or deliberations of a judge or
arbitrator in reaching
a decision, nor can the production of any notes
recording his or her thoughts or deliberations in that process be produced.
<P>

7	A number of cases have dealt with this including the <b><i>Duke of Buccleuch
-v- Metropolitan Board of Works</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281871%29%20LR%205%20HL%20418" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1871) LR 5 HL 418</a>; <b><i>Ex parte
Electronic Rentals Pty Ltd; re Anderson &amp; Ors</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1970%5d%203%20NSWR%20355" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1970] 3 NSWR 355</a>;
<b><i>Hennessey -v- Broken Hill Pty Limited</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1926/32.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1926] HCA 32</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281926%29%2038%20CLR%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1926) 38 CLR 342</a> at 349;
<b><i>Zanatta -v- McCleary</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%201%20NSWLR%20230" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] 1 NSWLR 230.</a>
<P>

8	In the last mentioned case Samuels JA referred to a suggested distinction
between the judges of superior courts and other judges,
but his Honour doubted
the distinction was valid and in <b><i>Ward -v- Shell-Mex and BP
Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281952%29%201%20KB%20280" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1952) 1 KB 280</a> it was held that evidence as to the reasons
which prompted a member of a Medical Board to come to the conclusion which
resulted in
the certificate which had been granted by the Medical Board was
inadmissible.
<P>

9	The principle was summarised by Samuels JA in <b><i>Wentworth -v-
Rares</i></b> (unreported Court of Appeal 19 December 1990), where his Honour
said:
<P>

	"It has been contended...that a judge is not compellable to produce documents
which have been involved in the performance of his
duties as a judge, including
drafts of judgments.  Secondly it is put that there is a public interest
immunity also which covers
the situation."
<P>

10	After referring to <b><i>Zanatta -v- McCleary</i></b> his Honour went on:
<P>

	"I think there is no significant difference between prohibition upon a judge's
being called to testify and his or her being required
to produce in documentary
form those considerations which have been involved in the act of judgment.  It
is a principle, I would
have thought, clearly justified by grounds of common
sense and policy."
<P>

11	For these reasons I am satisfied that the production of the remaining
documents so far as not produced cannot be compelled both
on the grounds of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
129</a> and public interest immunity under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s130.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 130.</a>  The plaintiff respondent has and
will have available at the hearing the transcript of the various days, the
reasons for the various
judgments and rulings, and will have ample opportunity
to make the points that are sought to be made by reference to those
documents.
<P>

12	Accordingly I make order 1 as in the notice of motion and I order the
respondent/plaintiff to pay the applicant/second defendant's
cost of the
motion.
<P>

13	Exhibits to be returned.
