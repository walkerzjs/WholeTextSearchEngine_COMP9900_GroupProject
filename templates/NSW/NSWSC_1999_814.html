<P>

<b>JUDGMENT -- </b>ex tempore
<P>

<b>9 August 1999</b>
<P>

1   	What follows are my reasons for the orders which are
appended to this judgment, made on the application of ASIC as Plaintiff
against
the First Defendant pursuant to a Summons dated 2 July 1999.  I note that
although the First Defendant has been advised of
these proceedings, the First
Defendant has not appeared. Nor has she put any matter to the Court in
opposition to the orders.
<P>

2   	The Orders sought in broad terms are substantially to the
effect that 
<P>

(a)	the First Defendant breached an enforceable undertaking given to ASIC not
to provide independent advice without a licence in
contravention of ss780 and
781 of the <i>Corporations Law</i>  and to so inform certain persons to whom
she had previously given investment advice,
<P>

(b)	restraining by way of injunction the First Defendant from giving such
advice, in contravention of ss780 and 781 of the <i>Corporations Law</i>,
and
<P>

(c)	by way of compensatory orders pursuant to s93AA(4)(c) of the <i>ASIC
Act</i> and s1324(10) of the <i>Corporations Law</i> requiring the First
Defendant to pay to one of the persons to whom she, still unlicensed and in
breach of undertaking, gave investment
advice, the sum of $163,666.17 for the
loss or damage suffered by him on account of her breaches of the
<i>Corporations Law</i> and of her undertaking in respect of him.
<P>

3   	The orders also include a freezing order over certain of
the First Defendant's assets with undertakings for the benefit of
innocent
third parties who may be affected.  Significantly, my orders also include costs
in favour of ASIC on an indemnity basis,
a matter to which I will return.
<P>

4   	Upon the materials before me including in particular
affidavits from the two investment advisory clients concerned, Mr Owen
Sattler
dated 2 July 1999 and Mrs Row dated 23 July 1999 coupled with the record of
interview dated 29 July 1999 by officers of ASIC
with the First Defendant in
which she admits to signing cheques as if signed by Mr Sattler, the following
can be concluded:
<P>

(a)	as stated by way of declaration in the accompanying orders, the First
Defendant has contravened the prohibitions on giving investment
advice without
a licence and has subsequently breached her undertakings in that regard,
<P>

(b)	in so contravening her undertakings and breaching the <i>Corporations
Law</i>, the First Defendant took, without authority, monies belonging to Mr
Owen Sattler in the amount of $163,666.17 and replicated his
signature without
his authority on seven cheques including a cheque for $121,656.35 in favour of
Mrs Row, thereby taking money belonging
to Mr Sattler and misappropriating
it.
<P>

5   	In those circumstances, a compensatory order was properly
sought pursuant to the relevant provisions of the <i>ASIC Act</i> and the
<i>Corporations Law</i>, namely s93AA(4)(c) and s1324(10) respectively.  The
standard of proof is the civil standard, but in the rigour of its application,
rising to the level called for by the gravity of the matters in question;
<i>Briginshaw v Briginshaw</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1938/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1938] HCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%2060%20CLR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1938) 60 CLR 336.</a>
<P>

6   	The First Defendant did not attend Court having had the
opportunity to do so nor put any matter in opposition.  In those circumstances,
I concluded that the Plaintiff should be in no different a position so far as
indemnity costs are concerned than if the First Defendant
were to have attended
Court and put no matter to the Court or only such matters as did not amount to
any kind of plausible or arguable
case.  In those latter circumstances, she
could not have resisted an order for indemnity costs.  Should ASIC be in any
worse position
because she did not attend Court and put no matter in opposition
to the orders sought?
<P>

7   	Although it appears that ASIC has not as yet formulated any
policy to the effect that it would automatically seek indemnity
costs in the
circumstances here applicable, ASIC via its Counsel, after consideration of the
matter, did seek indemnity costs.  I
consider that they are properly awarded.
It may be that ASIC will wish to consider this matter for the future as a
broader issue
of policy.  In that regard while ASIC will no doubt not wish to
discourage defendants with hopeless cases from not turning up to
court, there
seems no reason to reward such defendants if they fail to waste the court's
time by the lesser sanction of party and
party costs.  This is particularly as
the failure to turn up at all may be not unconnected with a desire to avoid
explicit admissions,
though I make no finding either way in that regard in the
present case.
