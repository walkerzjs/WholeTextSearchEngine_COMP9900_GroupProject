THE SUPREME COURT

OF NEW SOUTH WALES
<P>

EQUITY DIVISION
<P>

MASTER MACREADY
<P>

MONDAY 20 SEPTEMBER 1999
<P>

<b>3550/99 - BARNEY'S TIMBER PTY LTD  v  BETTE CECILE MASTERS DUNCAN</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR: This is an application to set aside a statutory
demand.
<P>

2  	The statutory demand in the matter is one that seeks repayment of
a judgment debt.  The amount sought to be recovered is the
sum of $18,120 and
the demand is dated 23 July 1999.  There is no doubt that the amount is owed as
the sum was subject of a judgment
debt, and that judgment debt was stayed only
for a period up to 19 July 1999.  There was no suggestion that there is any
genuine
dispute, nor could there be given the judgment and the lack of a
stay.
<P>

3  	The application is made, however, under s.459J (1) (b) which
provides that on an application under s.459G "The Court may by
order set aside
the demand if it is satisfied that ... (b) there is some other reason why the
demand should be set aside".
<P>

4  	The interrelationship of subsection (a) and (b) of 459J (1) have
been considered and finally resolved by the Full Court Federal
Court of
Australia in<b> Spencer Constructions Pty Ltd v G M Aldridge Pty Ltd</b>.
<P>

5  	The basis upon which the plaintiff suggests there is some other
reason is that the Defendant, the creditor, has refused to secure
the debt
following offers put to it by the Plaintiff.
<P>

6  	By way of background, the Plaintiff and its principal and sole
director, Mr Killoran, own properties, which are in the possess
of being sold
in response to the demand.  Offers were made to secure the amount of the demand
pending the completion of the contract.
<P>

7  	The first question is whether or not there might be an
appropriate power on this basis to set aside the demand.
<P>

8  	Important in the consideration of this is the terms of s.459E
(2).  That section provides for the contents of the statutory
demand and under
subsection (c) it is provided that the demand, 
<P>

"Must require the company to pay the amount of the debt or the total of the
amount of the debts or to secure or compound for an
amount or total to the
creditor's reasonable satisfaction within 21 days after the demand is served on
the company".
<P>

9  	The requirement to either pay, secure or compound the debt would
seem to be a reason for the power that is referred to in s.459J
(1) (b).
<P>

10  	This matter has been referred to in a number of cases.  The
first is<b> Chippendale Printing Co v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=150%20CLR%20682" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">150
CLR 682</a>, page 696 and 697.  The Court traced the history, and in particular
referred to paragraph 115 of the Australian Law Reform Commission's
draft
proposal which discusses the power in these terms:-
<P>

"This lack of general power would enable the Court to take into account matters
such as improper or invalid service, mistakes or
mistakes in notice of common
and unreasonable refusal of the creditor to accept an offer of the company to
meet the debt".
<P>

11  	The matter was taken up again by the Full Court in<b> Hoare Pty
Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation</b> in Full Federal Court 9 October 1995.
There the Court was concerned with a taxation debt and the question of whether
or not an underlying
dispute as to the taxation assessment could be used,
notwithstanding the strict provisions of s.175 to 177 of the Income Tax
Assessment
Act.
<P>

12  	In particular at paragraph 62 and 63 the Court referred to, with
approval, the fact that if there is some appropriate reason
a discretion can be
exercised to set aside the demand even without showing substantial injustice
would be caused.
<P>

13  	The Court referred to Chippendale's case and the explanatory
memorandums reference to a creditor unreasonably refusing the
company's offer
to meet the debt.
<P>

14  	Clearly, given the terms of s.459 E (2), if there has been no
secure or compound there may be a sufficient reason for the Court
to set aside
the demand.
<P>

15  	In the present case there has been an offer which has been
rejected, and it seems to me that in those circumstances if the
creditor
rejected the offer to secure the debt on an unreasonable basis then that would
be a ground for the Court to set aside the
demand.
<P>

16  	The correspondence and the communications clearly show the
course of the present proposal for the sale of property which will
produce
funds to enable the debt to be paid.
<P>

17  	The property is under a contract for sale made on 19 July 1999
which requires settlement by 56 days, about 12 or 13 September.
 The contract
also, apparently, requires a plan of consolidation to be prepared and
registered so that the certificate of title can
be available.  That process has
now reached the point of the plans having been approved by council, and several
days ago plans were
forwarded by the solicitors for the vendors to the Bank's
solicitors for their consent and subsequent lodgement.
<P>

18  	In the ordinary course, the evidence before me shows that the
plans will be registered and titles issued in three to four weeks
after
lodgement of registration.  No doubt that will be done a lot quicker if the
need arose.
<P>

19  	At this stage there has been no notice to complete issued under
the contract and, accordingly, any notice to complete would
obviously require,
under the terms of the contract, 14 days notice before there could be a
rescission.
<P>

20  	The offers to secure the debt were made in correspondence
between the parties' solicitors.  For instance, on 10 August 1999
reference was
made to the terms of contract that had been exchanged and which was not
conditional.  In a letter of 12 August 1999
the solicitors for the Plaintiff
offered to provide security for the debt by giving a registered mortgage over
the property.  The
contract provides that the land has been sold for $1.1
million.
<P>

21  	In any event there are mortgages apparently with the Bank of
Tasmania and the National Bank for $860,000.  This leaves some
security there
available for the creditor.
<P>

22  	The offer certainly would have elevated the judgment creditor
into the position of a secured creditor.  That proposal was rejected
on 12
August.
<P>

23  	Particular reference was made to the fact that the creditor did
not know who the other creditors might be.
<P>

24  	That was not an appropriate consideration because if the
creditor was to be secured the creditor would be in a better position
vis-a-vis
the other creditors because, apparently, it does not have notice of any such
other debts.
<P>

25  	Obviously implicit in the proposals and correspondence dealing
with the sale was a proposal that the debt would be paid out
of the proceeds of
the sale.
<P>

26  	Questions of difficulty in respect of mortgage were mentioned in
submissions.
<P>

27  	One could well see that if a mortgage were given it would
contain most of the normal terms, and those terms would provide for
the payment
of costs and expenses.  It would also obviously give the creditor some
flexibility if by any chance of the sale of the
land was not completed.  Being
a mortgagee, it could instigate a sale.  Or if the property was sold by the
first mortgagee it would
receive its payment out in priority to unsecured
creditors.
<P>

28  	There is another reason why it is also perhaps appropriate to
use the power in this circumstance.  That is, that the contract
provides in
special condition 1 (b) that if the vendor has a petition for winding up
presented then it shall be deemed to be in default
thereunder, and the other
party is in position to exercise any or all of its right under the contract.
Although, it is not clear
this may include a right to rescind under the
contract.
<P>

29  	Accordingly, one has a situation, if the demand is not set aside
the contract may be able to be avoided by the purchaser because
of the
presentation of a petition.
<P>

30  	In the circumstances of this matter it seems to me that the
refusal of the creditor to secure the debt in the circumstances
I have
mentioned is a sufficient reason to set aside the demand.
<P>

31  	Accordingly, I order that the demand for payment served by the
Defendant on the Plaintiff which is dated 23 July 1999 be set
aside.
<P>

32  	I order the Defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs of the
proceedings.
<P>

33  	Exhibits to be returned.
<P>
