<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR : </b> The plaintiff (Dairy Farmers) sues for remedies to
protect its registered trade marks and to enforce rights under a Trade Mark
Agreement
with the defendant (Norco).  Both parties carry on business in the
Dairy Industry, including processing milk products.  The plaintiff
is usually
known in trade as <i>"Dairy Farmers"</i>.  Both use <i>"LITE WHITE"</i>
trademarks for white reduced fat modified milk.  Dairy Farmers owns the trade
marks and Norco uses them under licence from Dairy
Farmers.
<P>

2	The proceedings relate to whether Norco is entitled to follow a practice
referred to in these proceedings as co-branding, and
display the name Norco and
a mark distinctive of Norco on the packaging of Lite White products without
Dairy Farmers' approval and
contrary to Dairy Farmers' wishes.  Dairy Farmers
have approved packaging which refers to Norco's name as processor in
conjunction
with acknowledgment of Dairy Farmers' ownership of the trade marks
and without any prominence.  <i>"Co-branding"</i> is an expression new to me
and first encountered as used by counsel in this case:  I will continue its use
for the present purposes,
without wishing to add it to the lexicon of trade
mark law.
<P>

3	<i>LITE WHITE</i> was registered in Part B of the Register of Trade Marks
under the <i>Trade Marks Act</i> 1955 from 15 June 1988 No B488929 in respect
of milk and milk products, goods included in Class No. 29.  The following were
conditions
of registration:
<P>

	<i>"Registration of this trade mark shall give no right to the separate
exclusive use of the words LITE and WHITE.</i>
<P>

<i>	Accepted on the provision of evidence of use.</i>
<P>

<i>	Registration of this mark extends throughout the states and territories of
Australia excluding Western Australia and the Northern
territory."</i>
<P>

4	When first registered the owner of the mark was New South Wales Dairy
Corporation.  The mark was transferred to Milk Marketing
(NSW) Pty Ltd by a
Deed of Assignment of 18 August 1989 recorded on  8 September 1992, and again
assigned to NSW Milk Brands Pty
Limited by Deed of Assignment dated 13 January
1998 and recorded on 13 May 1998.  Then it was assigned to the plaintiff by a
Sale
Agreement dated 25 March 1998 and recorded on 19 May 1998.
<P>

5	An associated trade mark No. B623151 was later registered in respect of milk
and milk products, goods included in Class No. 29,
from 21 February 1994.  This
mark consisted of the words:
<P>

	<i>  "Lite </i>
<P>

<i>	White</i>
<P>

<i>	Less fat, More taste!"</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>represented in a distinctive manner as set out in the Register.  The
associated trade mark was registered with the same conditions
as Trade Mark
B488929, and this additional condition:-
<P>

	<i>"Registration gives no right to the exclusive use of the words LESS FAT,
MORE TASTE."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>The first registered proprietor was Milk Marketing (NSW) Pty Limited.
The associated mark was also assigned to NSW Milk Brands Pty
Limited by the
Deed of Assignment of 13 January 1998 and again to the plaintiff by the Sale
Agreement dated 25 March 1998.
<P>

6	On 1 January 1996, when the repeal of the <i>Trade Marks Act</i> 1955 took
effect the Trade Marks became Registered Trade Marks for the purposes of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/tma1995121/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Marks Act</i> 1995</a>, which does not maintain the distinction between
Trade Marks in Part A and those in Part B.
<P>

7	For many decades the Dairy Industry in New South Wales was extensively
regulated;  deregulation occurred in stages, and the most
recent and most
significant took effect on 1 July 1998.  Before then milk producers in New
South Wales were not fully competitive
with each other, and these Trade Marks
were actually used by all milk processors within New South Wales.  New South
Wales Dairy Corporation
and Milk Marketing (NSW) Pty Ltd were controlled by the
Executive Government of the State and they functioned in relation to the
Registered Trade Marks as government bodies and as part of the regulatory
machinery, and they enabled processors to make arrangements
among themselves
for the registration and protection of the Trade Marks and for their use under
licence by all New South Wales milk
processors, as well as by some licensees
outside the State.  Agreements by the registered owner for use of the Trade
Marks and requirements
imposed on packaging and product standards were
expressions of collective arrangements among all processors.
<P>

8	Milk Marketing (NSW) Pty Ltd made requirements for the nature and quality of
the product produced under the Licence Agreements
and had powers to police and
inspect compliance by processors with standards.  In reality its requirements
were the result of agreement
among the processors.
<P>

9	The shareholders in NSW Milk Brands Pty Limited were the milk processors.
Assignment of the Registered Trade Marks to NSW Milk
Brands Pty Limited was a
step in preparation for the deregulation which was to occur on 1 July 1998, and
NSW Milk Brands Pty Limited
had the tasks of managing and protecting the use of
the Registered Trade Marks during the preparatory period and of disposing of
them.
<P>

10	Milk Marketing (NSW) Pty Ltd made a Trade Mark Licence Agreement dated 16
June 1995 with Norco by which Norco's use of the Registered
Trade Marks was
licensed until 30 June 2003.  This was part of a scheme of licence agreements
which gave similar rights to all milk
processors in New South Wales and
continued the substance of arrangements which had existed earlier.  The Licence
Agreement of 1995
related to use in a defined territory (clause 1.1
Definitions):-
<P>

	<i>"...the geographic area in which the User supplied any Milk as at 1 January
1995, or such other area as is agreed between the parties
following
implementation of the Distribution Sector Rationalization Scheme ."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>and clause 4 generally limited distribution to the territory (although
there were exceptions).  Norco's territory covered a large
tract in the north
of the State, centred around Lismore.
<P>

11	The Licence Agreement of 1995 contained provisions which show that it was
contemplated that the successors of each party would
be bound;  (see clause 1.2
(3)) although the user was not entitled to assign;  (see clause 12.2 and 16
(b)).
<P>

12	The place of the Licence Agreement of 1995 in the scheme of industry
regulation and limited co-operation among milk processors
is illustrated by the
territorial provisions of the Licence Agreement, and also and most clearly by
the provision relating to royalties
in clause 2.3;  the amount of royalties was
to be determined by the proprietor in a way which was revenue neutral to the
proprietor.
 This provision appears to be echoed in clause 5 (b) of the Sale
Agreement under which:- 
<P>

	<i>"The Purchaser undertakes to:</i>
<P>

<i>	...</i>
<P>

<i>	(b) ensure all revenue from royalties earned after 2 July 1998 is used
exclusively for funding promotion activities (including administrative
costs)
in relation to the Assets;"</i>
<P>

13	NSW Milk Brands Pty Limited disposed of the Registered Trade Marks by
conducting an auction on 25 March 1998 at which it was
open to New South Wales
milk processors to make bids.  The plaintiff was successful at $2,000,000.00
and entered into the Trade Mark
Sale Agreement dated 25 March 1998.  The Sale
Agreement provided for NSW Milk Brands Pty Limited to conduct marketing until 2
July
1998, under a Marketing Agreement which Dairy Farmers entered into,
although completion was to take place (as it did) soon after
the Sale Agreement
was made.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/tma1995121/index.html#p500" class="autolink_findacts">Part D</a> of the Sale Agreement listed a number of Licence Agreements,
and included the Licence Agreement of 1995 with Norco of 16 June 1995
in the
list of eight Licence Agreements with the eight milk processors which operated
in New South Wales.  (There were also Licence
Agreements with other processors
who operated in the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and New Zealand.)
Clause 5 (c) was as
follows:-
<P>

	<i>"The Purchaser  undertakes to;</i>
<P>

<i>	...</i>
<P>

<i>	(c) ensure that the sale of any Asset is subject to the Licence Agreements
in respect of that Asset."</i>
<P>

14	The terms of the Sale Agreement seem to establish (not altogether clearly)
and the terms of correspondence in evidence and the
manner in which the
proceedings were conducted also show that Dairy Farmers accept that, with
modifications relating to provisions
which it did not wish to enforce because
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</i> 1974</a>, it was bound by the Trade Mark Licence
Agreement with Norco of 16 June 1995, to which it was not a party and which it
did not ever
novate, unless and until it entered into another Licence Agreement
with Norco.
<P>

15	The parties made a new Trade Mark Licence Agreement, formed on 24 September
1998, and from the time it came into effect it took
the place of the Licence
Agreement of 1995.  The course of negotiations which led to that Agreement is
relevant because the operation
of the New Licence Agreement on the parties'
rights is alleged by Norco to be influenced by an estoppel.
<P>

16	By letter of 3 June 1998 from Mr Aroney, Dairy Farmers' Market Development
Manager, to Mr McKenzie, Norco's General Manager,
(A 64) Dairy Farmers told
Norco:-
<P>

	<i>"We propose to offer licensees two options in relation to Lite White and
Shape.  Firstly, licensees will have the choice of formalising
the changes to
the license agreements agreed to by NSW Milk Brands Pty Limited..."</i>
<P>

(The changes referred to related to waivers of clauses which did not conform to
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</i> 1974</a>.)
<P>

	<i>"As an alternative Dairy Farmers proposes to offer licensees the option of
licensing two new trade marks, Dairy Farmers Lite White
and Dairy Farmers
Shape, using Dairy Farmers packaging on substantially better terms than the
above license agreements.  In summary
the license agreements for these marks
will include the following terms:</i>
<P>

<i>	&#183;  Royalties set at 50% of the current royalty rate</i>
<P>

<i>	&#183;  License agreements based on current Lite White and Shape licenses
but simplified</i>
<P>

<i>	&#183;  Licence period of two years to 30 June 2000.</i>
<P>

<i>	A sample agreement including the above terms is attached for your
perusal.</i>
<P>

<i>	Dairy Farmers seeks your advice as to which license arrangements your
organisation will enter into by 30 June 1998.  We can then
forward the
appropriate agreements for your brands for execution."</i>
<P>

17	On 15 June 1998 Ms Maida Beale, a Marketing Manager of Dairy Farmers, wrote
to Norco's General Manager, Mr McKenzie, referred
to the communication of 3
June 1998 and said:-
<P>

	<i>"I would like to follow up on his communication and outline a number of
marketing details for the Shape and Lite White brands.</i>
<P>

<i>	<b>Packaging Changes</b></i>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b><i>Firstly, the packaging graphics for Lite White and Shape will
be revised.  Copies of the new design are attached for your reference
- two
versions, one with and one without the Dairy Farmers logo.  Companies wishing
to retain the existing license agreements will
need to use the generic Lite
White and Shape packaging only - the option to include your logo will not be
permitted..."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>Ms Beale went on to refer to a television advertising campaign which
was proposed.
<P>

18	(In my view it is doubtful whether Milk Marketing (NSW) Pty Ltd or Dairy
Farmers as its successor was entitled under the Licence
Agreement of 1995 to
require Norco to use revised packaging graphics;  it may be that Norco was
entitled to continue to use packaging
for which it held written approval until
it wished to make some change;  see clause 8.4;  but this is not completely
clear;  see
clause 8.2.)
<P>

19	On 6 July 1998 Mr Marchant on behalf of Norco wrote to Mr Aroney and
stated:-
<P>

	<i>"...we are considering our options regarding the Licence Agreements.  At
the same time we are reviewing our existing packaging stocks
for these product
lines and will look to formalise our response once this is known..."</i>
<P>

20	On 10 July 1998 Mr Aroney of Dairy Farmers again wrote to Mr McKenzie of
Norco and said:-
<P>

	<i>"As referred to in my previous letter, I enclose the revised license
agreements for the industry brands licensed to your co-operative.
 Could you
please arrange signature of the agreements by the appropriate officer.  You
will note that there are two originals of
each agreement.  Please retain one
original for your files and return the other to me at your earliest
convenience."</i>
<P>

Mr Aroney went on to deal with requirements for adapting the new artwork to
Norco's use;  in these adaptations there was no inclusion
of any Norco Trade
Mark or any reference to Norco except in an acknowledgment of ownership of the
trade mark for goods produced under
licence by Norco.  Mr Aroney said:-
<P>

	<i>"Whilst we have created the artwork for the brands, under the agreement we
still need to formally sign off on the artwork to be used
with your customised
details included.  Accordingly, when complete, could you please send us a copy
of the customised work so I can
formalise approval."</i>
<P>

Mr Aroney also dealt with requirements for schedules of royalty returns and the
incomplete Royalty Schedule in the revised licence
agreements which he
forwarded.  He said:-
<P>

	<i>"You will note that the Royalty Schedule attached to the agreements
requires a rate for royalties to be inserted.  This figure relies
on the CPI
figure.  The CPI figure for the year to 30 June 1998 is not published until the
end of this month.  Once this figure is
known, the rate and a revised schedule
will be sent out."</i>
<P>

21	In late July and in August 1998 correspondence passed between Tetra Pak Pty
Ltd which was to produce milk cartons for Norco,
and Norco relating to the
design of one-litre packaging which included Norco's name and a Norco trade
mark as well as the Lite White
marks.  In a message of 14 August 1998 Liz
Wilson of Dairy Farmers appears to have approved of this design but she
concluded:-
<P>

	<i>"Please amend the artwork and forward to both Norco and myself for
approval.  Thanks."</i>
<P>

22	On 12 August 1998 Mr Aroney proposed that Dairy Farmers would agree to
co-branding <i>"Lite White"</i> product as part of a discussion in which he
also proposed that Norco would agree that it would adopt packaging for another
product
called <i>"Shape"</i> without a Norco logo.
<P>

23	Mr Aroney told Mr Marchant that Dairy Farmers was reconsidering its position
about co-branding <i>"Lite White"</i> on 8 September in a telephone
conversation.
<P>

24	There were negotiations, including conversations between Mr McKenzie and
Dairy Farmers' Chairman Mr A R Tooth, for merging the
businesses of the two
companies in July and August.  Those negotiations came to a head in a letter of
offer from Dairy Farmers to
Norco of 27 July 1998 and a reply of 25 August 1998
conveying the terms of a board resolution to reject the offer.  The offer was
further considered by members of Norco at a general meeting later but was again
rejected.  Norco has since entered into a joint venture
arrangement with
Parmalat, an Italian organisation, and a merger with Dairy Farmers is unlikely.
During negotiations for the merger
indications were given on behalf of Dairy
Farmers of readiness to consider or allow co-branding, but these were never
expressed finally.
 Mr Aroney told Mr McKenzie in Denmark on 21 September 1998
that Dairy Farmers had decided not to allow Norco to use its logo on
the
<i>"Lite White"</i> packaging.
<P>

25	On 22 September 1998 Mr Aroney wrote to Norco for the attention of Mr
Marchant and said:-
<P>

	<i>"I confirm that in spite of our initial verbal indications that we would
permit the use of the Norco logo on the Lite White packaging,
we have now
formed the view that this would not be in the best interests of the Lite White
brand.  Accordingly, pursuant to Clause
8.4 of the license agreement, we will
not be approving any packaging that does not comply with the new standard
artwork previously
circulated."</i>
<P>

He also said:-
<P>

	<i>"...I have also noted that Norco has not signed and returned its former
industry brand license agreements.  If Norco is not interested
in continuing to
licence these brands, I would appreciate receiving formal written notification
of this as soon as possible.  If
not, could you please follow up and have the
agreements referred to above signed and returned immediately."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>In effect this letter confirmed what Mr Aroney told Mr McKenzie in
Denmark on 21 September.
<P>

26	The two forms of agreement which Mr Aroney forwarded on 10 July 1998 were
signed on behalf of Dairy Farmers under Power of Attorney
by Mr A R Tooth;  Mr
Tooth's signature was witnessed by Mr Aroney and bore date 9 July 1998.  In the
office of Norco the forms of
agreement were signed by Mr McKenzie on behalf of
Norco and witnessed by the Company Secretary;  the signature bears date 28
August
1998.  However no signed copy was sent back to Dairy Farmers in August;
and the method of formation of agreement clearly indicated
by the letter of 10
July and again referred to in the letter of 22 September was by signature and
return of an original.  Mr McKenzie
or his secretary on his behalf returned the
signed copy to Dairy Farmers with a With Compliments slip;  its date of receipt
was stamped
24 September 1998 and that in my finding was the time of formation
of the agreement.  This is the New Licence Agreement.  The delay
in returning
the document is not well explained but it was probably related, at least in
part, to the merger negotiations.
<P>

27	On 30 September 1998 Norco obtained approval from Dairy Farmers, attested by
a signature of Ms Liz Wilson on an example, of packaging
for one-litre
quantities of Lite White in a form which did not include a Norco Trade Mark,
but gave Norco's name as the party producing
the product under licence.  The
following day 1 October Ms Wilson approved production by Tetra Pak and use by
Norco of a week's supply
of the old cartons, as the new cartons were expected
to be ready on 9 October.
<P>

28	At present the only approval which Dairy Farmers has given relating to
one-litre cartons for use by Norco is approval of a design
which does not
include a Norco Trade Mark or co-branding;  with the minor exception, long
since exhausted, of the short term arrangement
for the beginning of October.
However Norco has continued to use packaging with its own trade mark for
two-litre containers and Dairy
Farmers has not given any approval for any
designs of two-litre containers.
<P>

29	Mr McKenzie wrote to Mr Aroney on 30 September 1998.  He referred to Mr
Marchant's letter of 22 September and to the discussions
in Denmark and
said:-
<P>

	<i>"Norco cannot accept your position on this and will continue to market Lite
White and Shape endorsed by Norco, as per the agreement
reached under the
original franchise documents signed between Norco and the milk
authority.</i>
<P>

<i>	Clause 8.4 in no way provides you with any authority to issue such
instructions.</i>
<P>

<i>	On a separate and unrelated matter, I notice that both Shape and Lite White
are being promoted under the Dairy Farmers brand.  This
is clearly outside of
the intention of the royalty payment, and as such, I will be instructing our
people to withhold any payment
of royalties and that all royalties will be put
into a trust fund until such time as it is clarified as to the purpose and role
of
this fund in respect of Lite White and shape to ensure that funds are
directed to the investment in Shape and Lite White and not
in any way to
endorse the Dairy farmer brand.</i>
<P>

<i>	Arthur, it is extremely disappointing that you have taken this action given
the agreement that you and I reached on the issue.  One
would like to think
that agreements reached are kept, but clearly in your case, you do not see fit
to do so."</i>
<P>

30	On 22 October 1998 (A133) Dairy Farmers stated its position in a considered
way;  Norco did not accept this and after further
correspondence including
correspondence between solicitors the litigation was commenced on 16 November
1998.  It was heard with expedition.
<P>

31	The position adopted by Norco in its letter of 30 September and since,
although very firmly stated between the parties at some
places, was not adopted
uniformly;  Norco asked for and obtained Dairy Farmers' approval for one-litre
packaging without co-branding,
and used such packaging for some months.  Dairy
Farmers' only approval for co-branding was in its terms clearly limited to
operate
for about a week and no more.
<P>

32	In the form of agreement which Mr Aroney sent Mr McKenzie on 10 July 1998
(A90) Schedule 2 which relates to the royalty began
with paragraph A in these
terms:-
<P>

	<i>"A.  The Royalty payable by the User during the first year of the </i>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b><i>Term until 1 July 1998 must be calculated at the rate of
3.466 cents per litre of the Product sold by the User (the `Base Rate').
 After
1 July 1998, the Base Rate will be [insert figure] cents per litre."</i>
<P>

33	Mr Aroney said in his letter:-
<P>

	<i>"You will note that the Royalty Schedule attached to the agreements
requires a rate for royalties to be inserted.  This figure relies
on the CPI
figure.  The CPI figure for the year to 30 June 1998 is not published until the
end of this month.  Once this figure is
known, the rate and a revised schedule
will be sent out."</i>
<P>

34	However as far as appears from evidence, no further communication was made
of the rate or of a revised schedule, and the document
which was signed and
sent back is still in the form originally forwarded with the passage
<i>"[insert figure],"</i> so it does not state the base rate after 1 July 1998.
The New Licence Agreement was admitted on the pleadings and no attempt was
made
to contend that it was not an effectual agreement, for this reason or for any
reason.  There could be no doubt about how the
initial royalty amount is to be
ascertained;  it is to be clearly understood from Dairy Farmers' letters of 3
June and 10 July that
the figure is to be ascertained as 50% of what the
royalty would have been in July 1998 under the escalation provisions of the
1995
Trade Mark Licence Agreement.
<P>

35	The New Licence Agreement contains clause 22 - Entire Agreement And
Modification - including the following:
<P>

	<i>"22.1 Entire Agreement</i>
<P>

<i>	This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to
its subject matter.  It sets out the only conduct relied
on by the parties and
supersedes all earlier conduct by the parties with respect to its subject
matter."</i>
<P>

36	In my opinion Clause 22.1 has the effect that on 24 September 1998 the
parties agreed that the Licence Agreement of 1995 was
no longer to have any
effect on their rights or on the relationship between them.  The evidence of Mr
McKenzie showed that he understood
that this was so.
<P>

37	In its Amended Defence filed on 19 February 1999 Norco alleges that
estoppels prevent Dairy Farmers from asserting that the New
Licence Agreement
and in particular clause 8.4 preclude Norco from co-branding.  The contentions
relating to estoppel were pleaded
in answer to Dairy Farmers' claims to be
entitled to restrain distribution of product in packaging of which Dairy
Farmers has not
approved, and from using promotional material, packaging
advertising and stationery of which Dairy Farmers has not approved.  The
Amended Defence refers to a number of matters in support of the alleged
estoppel, as follows:-
<P>

	- the practice in the Dairy Industry since 1988 of co-branding:
<P>

	- permission granted by Milk Marketing (NSW) Pty Ltd, in the 
<P>

	forms of approvals of co-branded packaging, for the practice;
<P>

	
<P>

	- knowledge from participation in the industry of co-branding 
<P>

	by Norco:
<P>

	
<P>

	- statements on behalf of Dairy Farmers about 12 August 1998 
<P>

	and during the period of negotiation to the effect that Norco could continue
co-brandings.
<P>

	
<P>

	
<P>

38	The position pleaded reflects the position taken in the letter of 30
September 1998 and in later correspondence, although not
always on uniform
grounds.  The position was supported in evidence by Mr McKenzie and by his
predecessor Mr Hoskins, who retired
on 2 January 1998.
<P>

39	Mr McKenzie said (in oral evidence t 30) to the effect that he regarded
discussions between Mr Tooth and himself as forming a
basis of Norco having a
continuing entitlement to co-brand for <i>"Lite White"</i> and <i>"Shape"</i>.
He said that these discussions took place as part of the merger proposals up to
the time when Norco's board rejected the proposal
in July, and Mr McKenzie
regarded them as a contractual commitment in place;  he said he believed this
absolutely.  In my finding
this was not a reasonable belief because the
assurances attributed to Mr Tooth were in the context of merger proposals which
came
to nothing;  such assurances might well have made good sense if there had
been a merger, but obviously fell away and could not be
relied on when Norco
rejected the merger.  In any event there could be no reason to suppose that
they continued to govern the parties'
relationship when they later made a
written agreement.
<P>

40	These discussions, like Mr Aroney's proposal of 12 August clearly were no
more than negotiations, and positions taken in them
could not be understood to
have contractual effect or binding effect;  and they could not be understood to
override the express provisions
of a written agreement which was then proposed
and which Norco later accepted.
<P>

41	In any event, before Norco accepted the written agreement, all indications
in negotiations of readiness to approve co-branding
had been withdrawn, and
Norco was confronted with a clear choice between relying on its rights under
the Licence Agreement of 1995,
and entering into the New Licence Agreement with
all its benefits and burdens, including the smaller royalty and the need to
obtain
approval of packaging.
<P>

42	The practice of co-branding white reduced fat modified milk by Norco existed
from the time when use of the Lite White Trade Mark
began about 1988, with the
permission of all Dairy Farmers' predecessors.  Although there may have been an
exception of minor importance,
the practice was almost universal among milk
processors in New South Wales throughout that period until Dairy Farmers bought
the
Trade Marks and sought to change the practice.  The practice would be
difficult to understand in an industry which was unregulated
and fully
competitive, and is comprehensible only when regard is had to the circumstances
in which New South Wales Dairy Corporation
and Milk Marketing (NSW) Pty Ltd
owned the Trade Marks, did not themselves process or market Lite White and
functioned as government
bodies exercising their rights as owners of the Trade
Marks in the interests of New South Wales milk processors generally.
<P>

43	Those processors enjoyed the substance of an interest although they did not
have a legal interest in the Trade Marks, and all
were advantaged by
co-branding.  Deregulation of the industry, the advent of full competition
among processors and the removal of
organising government activity and
ownership of Trade Marks by a company which did not have the ordinary
commercial motivations to
exploit them, and the conduct of an auction at which
a large sum of money was paid for the Trade Marks by one milk processor and
not
by the others marked in a very distinct way the end of all practices and
conventions associated with a regulated industry, and
transition to a quite
different scheme of things in which it is to be expected that ownership of a
trade mark will be a vehicle for
the pursuit of commercial interest, qualified
only by the provisions of the Sales Agreement which had the effect that
existing approvals
for co-branding could be relied on in the exercise of rights
granted under the Licence Agreement of 1995.  If any alteration in packaging
was to be made it was necessary to obtain Dairy Farmers' approval, and if a New
Licence Agreement was made it was necessary that
that approval should be
obtained under the new agreement.
<P>

44	Approval granted by Dairy Farmers' predecessor under another agreement which
no longer had effect could have no standing under
the New Licence Agreement,
and Dairy Farmers' approval under clause 8.4 of the New Licence Agreement would
be necessary for any use
by Norco.  As Norco was fully involved in the events
of deregulation, auction and negotiation of the New Licence Agreement it would
not have been reasonable for Norco to suppose that any previous practices,
however conventional they had become in a regulated industry,
would continue,
or that it would be obligatory for Dairy Farmers to conform to them.
<P>

45	While it is correct that there were indications in conversations during the
period of negotiations that Dairy Farmers would or
might approve of
co-branding, these were wavering and were not uniform, there was no basis in
the evidence for a view that Norco
regarded them as substituting for the terms
of the New Licence Agreement or relied on them, and it would not be reasonable,
having
regard to the circumstances in which they were made, for Norco to rely
on them in making the New Licence Agreement.  For the most
part, the
indications were given in the context of negotiations for a merger, and before
Norco accepted the New Licence Agreement
by sending it back a clear indication
had been given in Denmark and again in the letter of 22 September 1998 (A109)
that Dairy Farmers
would not approve the use of the Norco logo on the Lite
White packaging.
<P>

46	In my view there was no good basis for the position which Norco adopted in
its letter of 30 September 1998 (A112), or for the
assertions that Mr Aroney
had not kept an agreement which he had reached, or for later similar positions
taken on behalf of Norco.
 In my finding there has been no breach of any
engagement or undertaking however informal on the part of Dairy Farmers in
taking
its present position.
<P>

47	Norco's counsel made submissions in which it was contended that the practice
of co-branding which was engaged in by almost all
processors in NSW from 1988
onwards and at most times, and by Dairy Farmers among them, in a regulated
system in which the operations
of Milk Marketing was financed by royalties paid
by the processors, gave rise to a convention that co-branding was authorised
and
would continue, from which Milk Marketing and Dairy Farmers are now unable
to depart.  As the practice of co-branding was carried
out with the approval of
the registered owner, and as approvals were sought from time to time for
packaging and were given, including
in the case of Norco and at the time that
Dairy Farmers acquired the trade marks, express approval given under the
Licence Agreement
of 1995, is in my opinion not necessary but quite incorrect
to attribute the practice of co-branding to a convention which was seen
as
binding.  The practice is quite sufficiently explained by its being authorised
by the trade mark owners from time to time in the
exercise of their contractual
rights, and the absence of any withholding of authorisation is fully explained
by the then organisation
of the industry and the influence which processors had
over the affairs of Milk Marketing NSW Pty Ltd.  It is superfluous and
incorrect
to interpret parties' conduct as evidence of the existence of a
convention when they acted under express contractual rights.
<P>

48	In relation to what then were Dairy Farmers' rights, there were excessive
aspects of some matters stated in the letter of 3 June
1998.  Dairy Farmers was
not, in my opinion, entitled to impose a change in packaging or to prevent
processors from continuing to
use packaging including co-branding under the
Licence Agreement of 1995 and in accordance with approvals which they had
obtained
earlier.  However Dairy Farmers was able to offer processors an
opportunity to make new arrangements at half their existing rate
of royalty,
and to create a need to obtain approval for packaging with the new
arrangements, so a very large part of what that letter
proposed could be
justified.  Neither that letter nor any step in the later negotiations however
is a source of the parties' rights
at present;  these arise under the New
Licence Agreement.
<P>

49	There was no reason why an approval granted before formation of the New
Licence Agreement by Milk Marketing (NSW) Pty Ltd under
an agreement which no
longer had effect would be <i>"Prior written approval of the proprietor"</i>
under clause 8.4 of the New Licence Agreement.
<P>

50	On the facts in evidence as I understand them there is no basis for
concluding that any estoppel exists which prevents Dairy
Farmers from relying
on or exercising its various rights conferred by clause 8 to control among
other things packaging used by Norco,
or in particular from enforcing clause
8.4 by preventing Norco from distributing any packaging material without Dairy
Farmers' prior
written approval.
<P>

51	Even if there were a factual basis for an estoppel, whether viewed as an
estoppel by convention or a promissory estoppel relating
to the manner in which
rights under clause 8.4 would be exercised, the estoppel could not be enforced
because the New Licence Agreement
is as its terms show intended to be a
comprehensive written expression of the parties' agreement, so that its
provisions cannot be
qualified by evidence of the terms of the parties'
negotiations.  The estoppels here contended for would be inconsistent with the
express terms of clause 8.4 in that they would qualify the power which it
confers, and they would be directly contrary to the terms
of clause 22.
<P>

52	In these respects I follow the views of McLelland J in <i>Johnson Matthey v
A C Rochester Overseas Corporation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2023%20NSWLR%20190" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 23 NSWLR 190.</a>  I regard McLelland
J's views as well founded on the principle of giving effect to the formal,
final and considered expression of
the parties' contractual intention;  the
fact that they chose writing to express that intention shows the relative
weight they attributed
to earlier arrangements and understandings.  The view
expressed by McHugh JA (dissenting) in <i>State Rail Authority (NSW) v Heath
Outdoor Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%207%20NSWLR%20170" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 7 NSWLR 170</a> and acted on by Rolfe J in <i>Whittet v
State Bank of NSW </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2024%20NSWLR%20146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 24 NSWLR 146</a> does not, in my respectful opinion,
accord appropriate weight to indications of finality and completeness which the
parties give
when they adopt formal written expression.  The judgment of
McLelland J was followed by Miles CJ in <i>Skywest Aviation Pty Ltd v
Commonwealth of Australia</i> (1995)126 FLR 61 (see pages 102-106).  I
respectfully differ from the view of Rolfe J in <i>Whittet</i> and follow the
views expressed by McLelland J in <i>Johnson Matthey</i>.  I regard McLelland
J's view as well founded in principle and I do not regard the decision of the
Court of Appeal in<i> State Rail Authority of NSW v Heath Outdoor Pty Ltd</i>
as having established the views expressed by McHugh JA at 193.  My adherence to
this view has been reinforced with the passage of
time and accumulation of
experience of this and many other forensic endeavours to set up estoppels out
of the circumstances or terms
of pre-contractual exchanges;  the evidence
offered is often extensive, discursive and inconclusive and, where it is of any
value
at all, clearly of less value than the considered written expression.
Poorly based and incompletely considered forensic attempts
to set up
pre-contractual estoppels are unfortunately common, and in most cases they are
quite unuseful and very wasteful of resources.
<P>

53	In view of the facts of this case, its disposition does not turn on the view
which I have recorded.  It could not be said that
(echoing McHugh JA's
reference in <i>Heath Outdoor</i> at 193 to the decisive consideration) Dairy
Farmers induced Norco to give Dairy Farmers its rights over packaging in clause
8.4 by
assuring Norco that those rights would only be used in a way which
permitted co-branding;  the negotiations on that subject were
plainly not
intended to establish the position finally and did not expressly deal with
clause 8.4, they were not clear and they were
expressly withdrawn before the
contract was formed, and replaced with a firm statement that co-branding would
not be permitted. 
There is no room for an estoppel based either on any express
assurances or on more general considerations in the way in which affairs
had
been conducted in the industry, in a state of affairs which had been brought to
a definitive close with deregulation and the
purchase of the trade mark rights
for a large sum.
<P>

54	Norco also raised similar assertions of an estoppel in its Reply to the
Amended Defence and the Amended Cross-claim.
<P>

55	In my judgment, Norco has not established any of the estoppels for which it
contends.
<P>

56	Norco's counsel contended that limitations arise by implication on the
discretionary power to give or withhold approval of packaging
conferred by
clause 8.4 of the New Licence Agreement.  Allegations of implied terms appear
at a number of places in the pleadings;
 Amended Defence and Cross-claim
paragraph 13 (c) alleges an implied term of the Licence Agreement of 1995 that
Norco was entitled
to supply <i>"Lite-White"</i> in co-branded packaging,
paragraph 20 (b) alleges that it was an implied term of the New Licence
Agreement that Norco was entitled
to distribute milk in co-branded packaging;
with consequential claims for remedies in the Cross-claim.  In the Reply to
Amended Defence
and Amended Cross-claim it is alleged in paragraph 3.7, among
many matters which are said to disentitle Dairy Farmers to rely on
an exercise
of discretion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/tma1995121/s89.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 89</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/tma1995121/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Marks Act</i> 1995</a>, that the New
Licence Agreement contained a number of terms and obligations including (3.7.2)
that Dairy Farmers could not unreasonably
withhold approval of packaging,
(3.7.3.) that Dairy Farmers was obliged to exercise its discretion reasonably
in good faith and to
achieve or facilitate the operational purpose of the
licence agreement, (3.7.4) an obligation to co-operate to enable performance
by
each party of obligations, (3.7.5) an obligation not to affect prejudicially or
diminish the value of the licence and (3.7.6)
an obligation not to make it
difficult or impossible to enjoy and exploit the licence.
<P>

57	The New Licence Agreement is a licence;  it creates a commercial opportunity
for Norco and does not oblige Norco to exploit it
to any extent or to pay a
minimum royalty.  The whole of clause 8 appears to me to be significant and it
is in these terms:-
<P>

	<i>"8.	STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS</i>
<P>

<i>	8.1	Product Specification</i>
<P>

<i>	The proprietor must from time to time provide to the User details of the
specification for the Product and the User must at all times
comply with the
specification.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.2	Conformity to Standards</i>
<P>

<i>	The nature and quality of the Product produced by the User and all
packaging, stationery, advertising and promotional materials relating
to the
Product must conform to standards set by the Proprietor.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.3	Samples of Promotional Material</i>
<P>

<i>	The User must, at its own expense, submit to the Proprietor samples of all
packaging, promotional material, advertising and stationery
in or on which any
of the Trade Marks are used.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.4	Written Approval</i>
<P>

<i>	The User must not distribute any packaging, promotional material,
advertising or stationery on which any of the Trade Marks are used
without
prior written approval of the Proprietor.  The granting or withholding of any
such approval is at the sole discretion of
the Proprietor, and the Proprietor
must notify the User of its approval or otherwise within 14 days of receipt of
such samples.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.5	Advertising and Promotional Material</i>
<P>

<i>	The Proprietor acknowledges that the User must retain all of its right,
title and interest in any copyright or design works in or
attaching to any
packaging, advertising or promotional material submitted by the User to the
Proprietor in accordance with clause
8.3, and the User licences the Proprietor
and any other party nominated by the Proprietor to use such copyright or design
works on
a royalty-free basis.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.6 Control and Inspection</i>
<P>

<i>	The User must establish and utilise such inspection and testing facilities
as the Proprietor deems reasonably necessary to ensure
that the Products sold
or offered for sale by the User must comply with specifications laid down,
directions given and information
supplied by the Proprietor to the User from
time to time.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.7	Assistance to Proprietor</i>
<P>

<i>	The User must assist the Proprietor in the control of the nature and
quality of the Products and permit the Proprietor and its servants
and agents
reasonable inspection of the Products and all printed matter on which the Trade
Marks are used by the User. For this purpose
the User must permit the
Proprietor or its authorised representative to enter the premises of the User
at all reasonable times for
the purpose of inspecting the Products and the
methods of processing, testing, packaging, storage and distribution of the
Products
and will, if called upon by the Proprietor to do so, submit samples of
the Products and their packaging and information as to the
manner or use of the
Trade Marks for inspection by the Proprietor."</i>
<P>

58	When clause 8.4 is viewed in this setting, and in the setting of the whole
agreement, it must in my opinion be understood that
there are reasonable limits
to the purposes for which the discretion to grant or withhold approval may be
exercised.  The discretionary
power and all the provisions relating to
standards and specifications are ancillary to the purposes of the agreement,
which include
that the licence should be granted and enjoyed by Norco, and that
the manner in which the licence is exercised and the rights are
enjoyed should
be subject to restrictions so as to maintain the interests of Dairy Farmers in
its trade marks.  Nothing is added
to the meaning of the words which confer a
discretion by the word <i>"sole"</i> which does no more than emphasise that the
discretion is that of Dairy Farmers and of no other;  the word does not have
the force
of qualifying the grant of the discretion by some expression such as
<i>"absolute"</i> or <i>"unfettered"</i> (and those words, if used, are not
entirely inconsistent with the existence of some limitation;  see note at
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2073%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20175" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 73 ALJ 175.)</a>  The discretion is no more nor less examinable for being a
sole discretion.
<P>

59	In the light of the history of co-branding and the marketing of <i>"Lite
White"</i>, Norco's wish to continue co-branding was unremarkable and exposed
the interests of the registered owner of the marks to no potential
disadvantage
to which it had not long been exposed.  Acceptance by Dairy Farmers of the
continuation of this practice would have
been unremarkable and perhaps it would
be the outcome many objective observers would expect to emerge.  However it is
in no way the
only reasonable outcome of an address to the discretion which
could be reached. A wish to put an end to co-branding is well within
the range
of reasonable outcomes of the exercise of the discretion;  Dairy Farmers bought
the trade marks recently for a significant
sum of money and in competition with
other participants in the industry including Norco;  the new licence was
granted in a deliberate
departure from and revocation of the earlier
arrangements;  it was granted for a few years only at the end of which licence
arrangements
would not impede the exercise by Dairy Farmers of its rights as
registered proprietor.  It would be reasonable for Dairy Farmers
to look to the
association between its trade marks and itself both in the present and at a
future time after expiry of licence agreements,
and to have regard to its own
interests by seeking to end the association in the minds of customers between
its trade marks and one
of its commercial competitors.  There is nothing in the
New Licence Agreement which in any way requires Dairy Farmers to disregard
its
own present and future interests except the grant of the licence itself, and
there is no express or implied term authorising
co-branding or any other means
for Norco to give prominence to its association with the goods.  The packaging
approvals granted permit
a truthful statement to appear on the packaging of the
association between Norco and the goods.
<P>

60	In my view a discretionary decision against co-branding was well within the
range of the discretion conferred on Dairy Farmers
by clause 8.4 and the
circumstances do not indicate that the exercise of the discretion was affected
by any extraneous purpose, want
of honesty or of good faith or of
reasonableness, or by any conflict with any implied contractual doctrine
protecting Norco in the
enjoyment and exercise of the rights conferred.
<P>

61	Judicial consideration of limits in the nature of requirements of good faith
or reasonable conduct on the exercise of contractual
powers has been very
extensive.  Although it cannot be said that a general obligation of good faith
in the execution of contracts
has been established, opinion in the Court of
Appeal of New South Wales has shown openness to the implication of a duty of
good faith
both in performing obligations and in exercising rights;  see the
judgment of Sheller JA in<i> Alcatel Australia Limited v Scarcella &amp;
Ors</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/483.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 483</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 44 NSWLR 349</a> and his Honour's review of <i>"implied terms"</i>.
The nature of a contractual power and the circumstances in which it is to be
exercised can support such an implication, particularly
when such a power if
unlimited could operate to enable a party to defeat the contract altogether or
impose unreasonable burdens on
the other.  The implication is appropriate if
the contract and the power do not represent what it could reasonably be
supposed that
the parties intended unless there is some implied limitation
requiring reasonableness, honesty or good faith in its exercise.  These
will
often require the implication of some limitation, even if no more than a
requirement of honesty, if they are to represent anything
which it could
reasonably be supposed that the parties intended.  Powers, options and
elections which are conferred on a party so
as to enable it to decide whether
to take an advantage for itself must be recognised and distinguished from
powers conferred on a
party as means of establishing or deciding, so as to
affect the interests of all parties, some matter which must be decided if the
contract is to be executed effectively.
<P>

62	The implication of an obligation to make a decision in good faith may not be
available or the obligation may be qualified where
the contract gives the party
an opportunity to make a decision for the purpose of enabling the party to take
an advantage, or to
take it in a particular form or at a particular time.  By
and large contracts exist so that advantages may be taken, and a contractual
decision may be means for taking it.  Where there is an implied obligation of
good faith or reasonableness, what the obligation requires
is different to
altruism and different to acting without regard to one's own interests.
<P>

63	Attempts to give expression to the limit on the discretion cannot use
precise language;  I would formulate it in terms of its
being necessary to
exercise the discretion honestly, reasonably, in good faith, without depriving
either party of the benefit of
the agreement and for the purposes of clause 8.4
and of the contract as a whole, but these expressions have little value in
guiding
decisions, which must be based on an appraisal of what is put forward
on the facts in evidence as showing that the discretion has
not been duly
exercised.  The difficulty of delineation of what in substance is required by
an implied limitation does not detract
from the need for it;  if anything the
difficulty supports the need for implication and tends to explain why the
limitation was not
expressed.  The discretionary power of Dairy Farmers to
approve packaging conferred by clause 8.4 is in my opinion a power which
must
be exercised in good faith for the purpose of carrying out the New Licence
Agreement. Clause 8.4 like the rest of clause 8 is
ancillary to the conferral
of the licence:  for the New Licence Agreement to be carried out in an
effectual manner Norco must have
packaging.  Clause 8.4 cannot have been
intended to be the means for Dairy Farmers to take some market advantage for
its own products,
for example by withholding consent to all packaging so that
Norco's licence would be ineffective, or by requiring Norco to use unpleasant
colours, discouraging text or offensive images.  Business efficacy for the
grant of a licence requires the implication of limits
on the manner in which
Dairy Farmers may exercise its power of approval.
<P>

64	The fact that approval is withheld for a reason or granted subject to a
condition which restricts something that Norco wishes
to do is not necessarily
an indication that the discretion has been exceeded, as the interests of Dairy
Farmers may also be protected,
and the range of available discretionary
considerations which can reasonably be considered and acted on and the range of
possible
outcomes are very wide.  To my mind a decision not to permit
co-branding is well within the range of reasonable outcomes of consideration
by
Dairy Farmers within the overall purposes of the New Licence Agreement of what
packaging it should approve.  Dairy Farmers could
well take the view that
appropriate regard to its own interests in its Registered Trade Marks requires
that packaging emphasising
an association of the product with Norco should not
be approved;  a decision the other way would also be reasonable, and past
experience
illustrates this.  Dairy Farmers owns the trade marks, has paid a
significant sum for them, has only granted a licence for a limited
term, and is
entitled to contemplate a future when there may be no licence agreements and
Dairy Farmers may be the only user of its
marks.  Norco has no contractual
entitlement or assurance of continued co-branding under the New Licence
Agreement.  Within the terms
of Dairy Farmers' approval the connection of the
goods with Norco is stated accurately and without emphasis on the packaging,
the
association of the goods in the course of trade with Dairy Farmers as owner
of the trade marks is real although not strong, the packaging
is not deceptive
and those who read it will know the truth.  In my opinion Dairy Farmers'
approval of Norco's packaging including
its withholding approval of co-branding
has not been in breach of its implied obligation.
<P>

65	Among the claims in Norco's Cross-claim is claim 1:-
<P>

	<i>"An order that the Register of Trade Marks be rectified by cancelling or

to formerly patented substances or services and is not relevant.
<P>

70	In substance the case on the Cross-claim was that the words <i>"Lite
White"</i> became generally accepted within the trade in dairy products as the
words that describe or are the name of white reduced fat modified
milk.
<P>

71	The words <i>"Lite White"</i> state, with an immediately recognisable
orthographical departure, two highly obvious and significant characteristics of
the product,
and they are not inherently adapted to distinguish product as
having a connection in the course of trade with a particular person.
 The marks
were registered in Part B of the register under the <i>Trade Marks Act</i> 1955
and plainly were not registrable in Part A having regard to s 94 of that Act.
It does not seem possible that the words <i>"Lite White" </i>were distinctive
of goods with which the first registered owners were or might be connected in
the course of trade at the time when
they were registered.  It is surprising
that two such ordinary words referring to such obvious characteristics of the
product should
have been the subject of registration and legal monopoly, but it
should be inferred that they were registered because the view was
taken that
they were capable of becoming distinctive within subs 25 (1) within the concept
of distinctiveness established by s 26
of that Act.  The marks became
registered trade marks for the purposes of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/tma1995121/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Marks Act</i> 1995</a> by
the force of subs 233 (1) when the Act of 1995 came into effect on 1 January
1996.
<P>

72	The new register does not continue any division between what were formerly
marks in Part A and marks in Part B.  Although under
the Act of 1955 there were
significant differences in the effects of registration and susceptibility to
attack those distinctions
are not drawn in the Act of 1995, except that for
marks formerly in Part A s 234 continues the conclusiveness of registration
after
seven years formerly extended by s 61.  Otherwise the tests for
rectification of the new register are the same for trade marks formerly
in Part
B as for trade marks formerly in Part A.
<P>

73	Protection against removal extended to the Lite White marks has been, to
some degree, promoted by the legislative changes.  As
well as being susceptible
to action under subs 87 (1) by reference to s 24, registered trade marks are
susceptible of amendment or
cancellation under s 88 on grounds stated in subs
88 (2).  The susceptibility of trade marks formerly registered in Part B to
action
under s 88 is limited because Ground 88 (2) (a) - <i>"any of the grounds
on which the registration of the trade mark could have been opposed under
Division 2 of Part 5"</i> is unavailable;  registration of a Part B trade mark
could in no case have been opposed under Division 2 of Part 5 because they all
achieved automatic registration under s 233 of the Act of 1995 without there
being any opportunity for opposition.  (The reference
to Division 2 of Part 5
takes the reader by way of s 57 - registration may be opposed on the same
grounds as for rejection - to the
elaborate process of consideration in
Division 2 of Part 4, particularly to s 41).
<P>

74	Grounds 88 (2) (b), (d) and (e) are also inapplicable.  However in my
opinion Ground 88 (2) (c) is applicable.  Its terms are
as follows:
<P>

	<i>"(2)  An application may be made on any of the following </i>
<P>

<i>	grounds, and on no other grounds:</i>
<P>

<i>	.........</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)  because of the circumstances applying at the time when </i>
<P>

<i>	the application for rectification is filed, the use of the trade mark is
likely to deceive or cause confusion for a reason other
than one for
which:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)   the application for the registration of the </i>
<P>

<i>	trade mark could have been rejected under section 43 or 44;  or</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)  the registration of the trade mark could have </i>
<P>

<i>	been opposed under section 60;"</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>For a trade mark which was formerly in Part B there could be no reasons
which fall within sub-para (i) or para (ii), so Ground (c)
is available if the
use of the trade mark is likely to deceive or cause confusion for any
reason.
<P>

75	I have inferred, as a matter of probability, that the trade marks achieved
registration in Part B on the footing that they were
capable of becoming
distinctive of goods with which the first registered owner might be connected
in the course of trade. The analysis
I have made of the grounds in subs 88 (2)
shows that the marks cannot now be removed on any ground such as that they did
not in fact
become distinctive or for that matter that they are not capable of
becoming distinctive.  They can be removed on the ground in subs
24 (1) invoked
by subs 87 (1), to the effect that after the date of registration the sign
became generally accepted as descriptive.
 Subsection 24 (1) does not speak in
terms of distinctiveness and must be understood and applied according to its
own terminology.
 The Cross-claimant has the burden of proving for each mark
that a process happened in which the mark became generally accepted as
descriptive, that is to say that there was a change in general acceptance of
its function, and also has the burden of proving that
this process happened
after the date of registration.  (The curiosity is that it would seem that if
the sign always was descriptive,
and that it never became distinctive or even
that it was incapable of becoming distinctive, it cannot now be removed).
<P>

76	The date of registration relates back to the filing date of the application
for registration, having to regard to the definition
of <i>"date of
registration"</i> in s 6 and to the provisions of subs 72 (1), the terms of
which are equally applicable to an application under the Act of 1955 as
to one
under the Act of 1995.
<P>

77	In support of its position on the facts counsel for Norco submitted that
<i>"Lite White"</i> is and always was descriptive of white reduced fat modified
milk.  Counsel also referred to the following matters which are established
by
evidence, in substance without any dispute.
<P>

78	Norco obtained approval from Milk Marketing (NSW) Pty Ltd to use co-branded
packaging in 1988 and continued to use it throughout
the period in question
with approvals for co-branded packaging from registered owners from time to
time.  Other milk processors used
the trade marks with co-branding, with
approval of the registered owners from time to time of their packaging, for
substantially
the whole period.  Apparently from soon after the time when Norco
began to do so and certainly from 1991 onwards all milk processors
in New South
Wales used such co-branded packaging for substantially all the time, although
there may have been an insignificant exception
for a relatively short period.
(The exception is that there was a time after National Foods took over United
Dairies and until September
1996 when National Foods did not co-brand Lite
White).  Other processors which did not operate within New South Wales also
used the
trade marks with the approval of the registered owners from time to
time and with co-branding.
<P>

79	The cross-claimant's counsel also relied on evidence that officers of Norco
expected that co-branding would continue after the
changes of 1998 and asserted
that others so expected;  however I do not regard that as relevant.  The best
example of such an assertion
is the evidence of Mr McKenzie to the effect that
(t 29):-
<P>

	<i>"It was always agreed in the industry that we would be able to continue to
endorse the product by utilising our brand."</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>I do not regard that assertion as establishing the matter asserted, but
if it did it would not be relevant.
<P>

80	The Cross-claimant's counsel asserted that by 1998 each of the milk
processors had gained reputation and good-will in the marks
in the geographic
regions in which they operated, and that building up that reputation was
assisted by the promotion carried out
by Milk Marketing (NSW) Pty Ltd for some
years with the proceeds of licensing paid to it by milk processors.  Counsel
contended that
it should be found that as a consequence Lite White was
recognised as a product of the individual milk processor whose logo was
displayed
on the carton.
<P>

81	On the basis of the material in evidence I am not able to find the issue
posed by subs 24 (1) in favour of the Cross-claimant.
 The use of the trade
marks with co-branding and the behaviour of milk processors in acting together
within the regulated industry
in ways which brought it about that all were
licensed to use the trade marks with co-branding appears to me to demonstrate
the contrary
proposition, that is that all treated the trade marks as protected
by law, and that all carried on their use and co-branding under
licence
agreements and arrangements for the approval of their packaging.  I infer that
it was commercially rational to do so rather
than to disregard or attack the
position of the registered owners of the marks.  To my mind the facts
demonstrate that there was
not a process in which the marks became generally
accepted as descriptive, but the marks continued to be regarded and treated as
defensible registered trade marks the use of which was worth having, worth
protecting by licence agreements and worth paying money
for.
<P>

82	All the evidence put forward relates to use by milk processors and the
perception from the point of view of milk processors,
and none related to the
perception by any other participants in the trade, of customers or of
retailers, of the meaning of the words
Lite White and whether they were
descriptive.  There was no indication of a change in acceptation such as subs
24 (1) requires.
<P>

83	As s 24 does not apply in relation to either mark there should be no
rectification under s 87.
<P>

84	The Cross-claimant's reliance on s 88 and its contentions in support of a
finding on Ground 88 (2) (c) were based on the same
body of evidence.  It was
contended that the Lite White marks are not capable of distinguishing Dairy
Farmers' goods and that the
use of these ordinary English words as a trade mark
is likely to deceive or cause confusion.  In the context of the system of
licensing
and approval of packaging, and of the packaging which in all
instances of the use of packaging in New South Wales of which evidence
speaks
contained accurate statements of the source of the goods and identified the
processor as well as the registered owner, there
is in my finding no likelihood
of deception or confusion.  The circumstances applying at the present time
include approval by Dairy
Farmers of packaging which will identify Norco in a
clear way to those who take the trouble to read the packaging, and indeed in
every way except by displaying Norco's own trade mark or logo.  Dairy Farmers
does not require the packaging to display any information
which is deceptive or
confusing.  The situation might be different if Dairy Farmers' control over
packaging were abused, but it has
not been.
<P>

363.</a>  The facts of the present case as I have found them do not raise
consideration of s 89.
<P>

86	The question raised by Ground 88 (2) (c) whether because of the
circumstances applying when the Cross-claim was filed and the
proceedings were
heard (and they were only separated by a few days) the use of the trade mark is
likely to deceive or cause confusion
for any reason is a question of fact.  It
is difficult to conjecture what evidence could deal in detail with that
likelihood.  In
this case there was no such evidence and the Court is left, as
is usual when such issues are raised, to its knowledge of the trade
marks and
of the English language, and to general considerations based on the knowledge
which the Court shares with the community
at large about the workings of trade,
the minds of customers and the influences on them.

<P>

	<i>"However, not only is the likelihood or unlikelihood of deception or
confusion a question of fact but it is very much a matter of
impression."</i>
<P>

90	The evidence shows that purchasers of milk products bearing the Lite White
brands have had the opportunity to know those brands
and to know that they are
registered trade marks for some years, about eleven years for the first mark,
and have had the opportunity
to know that the marks indicate a connection in
the course of trade with the registered owner;  different registered owners
from
time to time. There has been a connection in the course of trade with the
registered owners from time to time, as they have had contractual
entitlements
to control the formulation of the product and the manner of use of trade marks
under their licensing agreements, and
the contractual entitlement to control
use of the trade marks by granting or withholding licensing;  no less an
entitlement for never
having been withheld from a New South Wales milk
producer.  Statements on the packaging have been available for those disposed
to
read closely to understand that there is both a registered trade mark owner
and a milk processor behind the product, and the past
practice of co-branding
could only emphasise that there was both a Lite White trade mark with a
registered owner, and also a milk
processor.  It is only on the supposition
that language is meaningless to customers and the statements on each package
identifying
both trade mark owner and milk processor have no effect that it
could be concluded that the practice of co-branding has created an
association
between the Light White brands and the reputation of a co-branding milk
processor.  I would not reason thus or infer
that deception or confusion have
existed, or would be created by removing the co-branding and leaving the
identifying statements.
<P>

91	My finding is that the use of the trade marks is not likely to deceive or
cause confusion in terms of Ground 88 (2) (c).
<P>

92	The Cross-claim also claims a number of declaratory and consequential orders
which my holdings thus far establish should not
be made.
<P>

93	If it were otherwise appropriate to find that use by licensed milk
processors in New South Wales of the Lite White trade marks
had created an
association between the registered trade marks and the milk processors such
that discontinuing co-branding would be
likely to deceive or cause confusion,
the question would present itself whether the cross-claimant is entitled to
rely on such use
by itself or other licensed milk processors having regard to
the provisions of subs 7 (3) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/tma1995121/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Marks Act</i> 1995</a> which
provides:-

	<i>"An authorised use of a trade mark by a person (see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/tma1995121/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 8)</a> is taken,
for the purposes of this Act, to be a use of the trade mark by the owner of the
trade mark."</i>

quality control or control of the user in the
sense in which a parent company controls a subsidiary.  Use by either the
registered
proprietor or a licensee ( whether registered or otherwise) will
protect the mark on the ground of non-user, but it is essential
both that the
user maintains the connexion of the registered proprietor with the goods and
that the use of the mark does not become
otherwise deceptive.  Conversely
registration of a registered user will not save the mark if there ceases to be
relevant connexion
in the course of trade with the proprietor or the mark
otherwise becomes deceptive."</i>
<P>

95	It will be seen that Aickin J did not treat use by a licensee as a means by
which use of the mark could become deceptive.  I
have found that the use of the
trade marks is not likely to deceive or cause confusion, but if there were such
a finding based on
use by licensees including the cross-claimant I would think
that the cross-claimant would be disentitled to rely on that use.
<P>

96	In my judgment the plaintiff should have the remedies claimed and the
Cross-claim should be dismissed.
<P>

97	The Statement of Claim continues claims 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 and 10 in the Summons.
At the hearing the plaintiff did not seek damages
or interest.
<P>

98	I will make orders as in the claims 3 and 4 in the Summons.
<P>

99	The orders are:-
<P>

1.  Order that the defendant its servants and agents be restrained
<P>

from distributing any packaging, promotional material, advertising or
stationery which bears registered trade mark B 488929 (LITE
WHITE) or
registered trade mark B 623151 (LITE WHITE and device) without the prior
written approval of the plaintiff.
<P>

2.  Order that the defendant account to the plaintiff for all
<P>

quantities of white reduced fat modified milk sold under the said trade marks
pursuant to the terms of the Trade Mark Agreement
made between the parties on
24 September 1998.
<P>

3.  Order that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the
<P>

proceedings.
<P>

4.  Order that the Cross-claim be dismissed with costs.
<P>

I hereby certify that paragraphs 1-99 are the reasons for judgment of the
Honourable Justice John Bryson.
<P>
