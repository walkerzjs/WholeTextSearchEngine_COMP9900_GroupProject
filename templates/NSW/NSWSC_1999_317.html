<b>INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW</b>
<P>

1	The present proceeding is an application by Miss Wentworth as Plaintiff for
costs against Deputy Registrar Howe, the Crown in
right of the State of New
South Wales and the Defendant. It arises out of the review by this Court in its
supervisory jurisdiction
of Deputy Registrar Howe's decision not to disqualify
himself on the ground of bias and/or apprehended bias. Miss Wentworth claims
not only costs pertaining to that review, but also costs of and incidental to
the taxation and earlier collateral challenges to it.
There is therefore a
preliminary question as to whether the latter costs could be recovered at all
in these proceedings. In addition
the Plaintiff seeks uncontroversial
directions for the future conduct of the taxation.
<P>

2	This application follows my judgment of 6 February 1998 wherein I concluded
that Deputy Registrar Howe had so conducted the taxation
as to give rise to a
reasonable apprehension of the possibility of bias on the part of the Plaintiff
but made no determination of
actual bias. His determinations, made in the
taxation of the Plaintiff's bill of costs (filed 21 February 1992) were set
aside including
his reconsideration of the taxation and his cost orders made in
relation to the taxation. I did not set aside, but declared severable,
certain
interim certificates issued by Deputy Registrar Howe to the extent they cover
the amounts paid. I declined in that judgment
to make the general cost orders
then sought by the Plaintiff against the Defendant for "the whole of the costs
of the taxation process
to date including the costs of all applications which
have arisen to date from the entire failure of the taxation process, on an
indemnity basis".
<P>

3	The present proceeding raises the issue of the precise status, functions and
degree of immunity, if any, of a taxing officer carrying
out the taxing of a
bill of costs and its reconsideration under the then applicable Rules of the
Supreme Court ("the Rules") (Pt
52) as they stood prior to the amendments
gazetted on 2  October 1992.
<P>

4	The issue of amenability of a taxing officer to costs orders is an important
one in the administration of justice in this Court.
It is not covered by
authority dealing with the precise point. It may be accepted that there is
jurisdiction to make an order in
appropriate circumstances against a non-party
though such an order is to be approached with caution and will always be
exceptional;
see s76 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</i> 1970</a> ("the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>") and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt
52A</a> r4(2) and (5) of the Rules and the authorities later cited. But such an
order will not be made where a <i>judicial</i> function is exercised, or its
equivalent. Thus if that officer's position in exercising that function be
equated to that of a superior
court judge, such a judge enjoys immunity from
civil action and cost orders, except where he or she knowingly acts outside
jurisdiction
(<i>Sirros v Moore</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%201%20QB%20118" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 1 QB 118).</a> If that officer's
position is instead equated to that of an inferior court such as a magistrate
at common law, the level of immunity
still requires the relatively high hurdle
that the officer concerned "has been perverse, guilty of corruption, or gross
ignorance
or similar serious misconduct"; <i>Ex parte Blume &amp; Anor</i>;
<i>Re Osborn &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281958%29%2075%20WN%28NSW%29%20411" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1958) 75 WN(NSW) 411</a>; <i>Anstee v Werry</i> (NSWSC,
Smart J, 5 September 1986, unreported). Miss Wentworth contends that the
findings of my judgment satisfy that level of misconduct
so described,
notwithstanding that no finding of actual bias was made.
<P>

5	However, Miss Wentworth principally contends that the status and functions of
a taxing officer are quasi-judicial, meaning merely
administrative and lacking
essential attributes of the judicial process. She points to the status of the
Deputy Registrar as an employee
of the State who, though described as an
officer of the court is not a judicial officer. The taxing officer in the
taxation process
issues a certificate which itself, unlike a judgment or court
order, is incapable of grounding a bankruptcy notice or of being enforced
without a court order. She contends that reference to "judicial", when so
qualified by the description "quasi", means only that the
taxing officer,
though exercising an administrative function of taxation, must nonetheless
apply the rules of natural justice. She
cites H W R Wade <i>Administrative
Law</i> 5th ed. (Clarendon Press - Oxford, 1982) at 45 (and see also 458-9):
<P>

	"A quasi-judicial function is an administrative function which the law
requires to be exercised in some respects as if it were
judicial. The stock
example is a minister deciding whether or not to confirm a compulsory purchase
order or to allow a planning appeal
after a public inquiry. The decision itself
is administrative, dictated by policy and expediency. But the procedure is
subject to
the principles of natural justice, which require the minister to act
fairly towards the objectors and not (for example) to take fresh
evidence
without disclosing it to them. A quasi-judicial decision is therefore an
administrative decision which is subject to the
principles of natural
justice."
<P>

(In the later 1994 7th ed., this passage is repeated, though the last sentence
reads "A quasi-judicial decision ...... is subject
to some measure of judicial
procedure, such as the principles of natural justice".)
<P>

She contends that Deputy Registrar Howe, having failed to apply the rules of
natural justice, invokes the undoubted jurisdiction
to make orders against a
non-party (s76 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 52A</a> r4(2) and (5). She seeks to call in aid by
analogy principles applicable to the action for misfeasance in public office in
contending
that the jurisdiction should be exercised. This could only be by
analogy, as no such action has been brought. Alternatively, she
invokes the
inherent power of the Court to do what is just and proper in the
circumstances.
<P>

6	The position to the contrary is that the status and functions of a taxing
officer are properly described as judicial or quasi-judicial
or otherwise enjoy
what I term a derivative immunity; that in consequence they enjoy such a level
of immunity as would preclude any
cost order in the circumstances. After
setting out the salient facts, I deal with the various circumstances which give
rise to the
various levels of immunity.
<P>

<b>SALIENT FACTS</b>
<P>

7	Miss Wentworth, as Plaintiff in proceedings 3748/89, alleged bias and
apprehended bias against Deputy Registrar Howe, in the conduct
of taxation
proceedings, contending that he should have disqualified himself for that
reason from the conduct by him of the taxation
of the Plaintiff's bill of
costs. The taxation proceedings were associated with a strenuously fought
application made by the Plaintiff
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s7</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</i>
1982</a> (NSW). An agreed chronology prepared by the Deputy Crown Solicitor's
office is in the file. It gives some insight into the unconstrained
ramifications of this litigation. I concluded in a written judgment dated 6
February 1998 (at 62-3) as follows:
<P>

"My conclusions can be stated in summary form as follows:
<P>

1.	I am satisfied that it has been firmly established that Taxing Officer Howe
so conducted the taxation as to give rise to a reasonable
apprehension of the
possibility of bias on the part of the Plaintiff, based upon the matters which
I have earlier identified.  It
follows that the determinations of Taxing
Officer Howe in the taxation, including the reconsideration must be set aside
save as to
his determination that the relevant interim certificates should
issue and payments be made thereunder in the amounts actually paid;
 in
addition any cost orders made by Taxing Officer Howe in relation to the
taxation must be set aside.
<P>

2.	No order as to costs is made in relation to the present proceedings."
<P>

8	My reasons for that conclusion are set out at length in the written judgment.
No finding of actual bias was made.
<P>

9	Earlier, at page 62, I had this to say in regard to the Plaintiff's then
application for costs orders against the Defendant, Mr
Peter Wentworth:
<P>

	"Finally the Plaintiff seeks cost orders against the Defendant and in
particular an order that the Defendant pay the costs of the
Plaintiff of the
whole of the taxation process to date including the costs of all applications
which have arisen to date from the
entire failure of the taxation process, on
an indemnity basis.  In my judgment no such orders should be made.  The
Defendant has
it is true put the Plaintiff to proof regarding the matter of
bias, but the Defendant was entitled to do this.  The Plaintiff would
be put to
proof in any event whether the Defendant had played a role or not in the
initial stages of the present proceedings.  It
would be wholly inappropriate
for cost orders to be made against the Defendant in the circumstances.
Moreover  the Defendant was
entitled to contest the Plaintiff's contentions
before the Taxing Officer, though it is to be regretted that the proceedings
overall
were contested by both parties in so unconstrained a way.  However it
is not possible to attribute a preponderance of responsibility
for this to
either party.  All of this has, as Clarke JA observed (Wentworth v Wentworth at
36) "meant that the court, and officers
of the court, have been required to
spend an excessive amount of court time in resolving one incidental aspect of
litigation between
two people."  That said, I do not detract from the
Plaintiff's right to have this aspect of the Taxing Officer's determinations
dealt
with by this Court."
<P>

10	Subsequently, on 1 July 1998, I made orders in the following terms:
<P>

"1.	Subject to order 2, the determinations of Taxing Officer Howe made in the
taxation of the Plaintiff's Bill of Costs filed 21
February 1992, including the
reconsideration of the taxation and any orders made in relation to the
taxation, be set aside.
<P>

2.	The Interim Certificates issued by Taxing Officer Howe on the dates listed
below, to the extent they cover the amounts paid thereunder
by the Defendant to
the Plaintiff, are not set aside but declared severable from the rest of the
taxation."
<P>

			6 April 1992
<P>

			1 September 1992
<P>

			10 May 1994"
<P>

11	When those orders were made, the Plaintiff foreshadowed that she wished to
have the opportunity to put submissions regarding
the conclusion reached in my
judgment that no order as to costs should be made in relation to the present
proceedings and in particular,
that she would be putting submissions that cost
orders should be made against both the Defendant and, as had not previously
been
foreshadowed, against Deputy Registrar Howe. As Miss Wentworth had not had
the opportunity to address me on costs before I handed
down the judgment of 6
February 1998, I acceded to her request to make submissions, and these were
made in writing on 13 August 1998
as well as orally and were subsequently
elaborated in oral and written argument before me. Dr Birch, as amicus curiae,
has again
assisted the court with submissions.
<P>

12	The Plaintiff's written submissions consisted of her initial submissions of
13 August 1998, further submissions of 6 and 9 November
1998, written
submissions dated 25 March 1999 in reply to Dr Birch's earlier written
submissions of December 1998 and, finally, her
written submissions dated 29
March 1999 in reply to Dr Birch's further written submissions of 25 March 1999.
In addition both Miss
Wentworth and Dr Birch addressed me orally. The Plaintiff
thus was afforded a full opportunity to address me on the issues she raises.
<P>

13	By letter dated 29 March 1999 the Defendant, Mr Peter Wentworth, and Deputy
Registrar Howe were invited, if they wished, to put
any matters, in relation to
any orders that I may make in relation to costs and were given until 6 April
1999 to indicate their position.
Similarly, the Crown in right of the State of
New South Wales, has been informed of the proceedings and given an opportunity
to put
any matters it may wish. None of Mr Wentworth, Deputy Registrar Howe or
the Crown in right of the State of New South Wales have chosen
to make any
submissions. The Plaintiff had earlier notified Deputy Registrar Howe of her
intention to seek the cost orders in relation
to him by letter dated 19 March
1999 sent by facsimile on that date. In view of the shortness of that notice, I
concluded that it
was appropriate that Mr Wentworth be given this additional
opportunity to make such submissions if he so chose.
<P>

<b>PRINCIPAL ISSUES</b>
<P>

14	The Plaintiff's submissions raise three general issues.
<P>

<b>First Issue -- Jurisdiction and Discretion in relation to Cost Orders and
their Potential Scope:</b>	
<P>

(i)	Whether an order of costs can and should be made against Deputy Registrar
Howe and/or the Crown in right of New South Wales
either by reference to the
principles of misfeasance in public office, if capable of application at all,
or as otherwise just and
equitable, and, if so, 
<P>

(ii)	whether any such order for costs could extend beyond the costs of the
review before me to include, as sought by the Plaintiff,
costs of the
associated taxation and re-consideration before Taxing Officer Howe, the review
of that reconsideration by Master McLaughlin
and the costs of the appeal before
the Court of Appeal insofar as related to the foregoing taxation, and all costs
incidental to
those proceedings?
<P>

<b>Second Issue -- Cost Orders against the Defendant:</b>	Can and should any
order for costs be made against the Defendant, Mr Peter Wentworth, and, if so,
the scope of such cost order having
regard to the answer to the previous
question?
<P>

<b>Third Issue -- Future conduct of the Taxation:</b>	What directions can and
should now be made for the future conduct of the taxation following the setting
aside, save for interim certificates
of the earlier determinations of Deputy
Registrar Howe in the taxation?
<P>

<b>First Issue -- Jurisdiction and discretion in relation to cost orders and
their potential scope</b>
<P>

15	In seeking a cost order against Deputy Registrar Howe, Miss Wentworth puts
her claim as follows.
<P>

(i)	The costs sought to be recovered fall into two categories. First there are
the costs of the successful application to set aside
the determinations of
Deputy Registrar Howe. This is made pursuant to the court's inherent
supervisory power by way of review not
appeal, to control the authority which
it delegates to its taxing officers; see page 24 of my judgment of 6 February
1998. I refer
to these costs, for convenience, as "the review costs". Second,
as elaborated in the agreed chronology, there are the costs of the
taxation and
reconsideration before Deputy Registrar Howe, the costs of that reconsideration
referable to the hearings before Master
McLaughlin, and the costs associated
with the proceedings in the Court of Appeal culminating in its judgment of 21
February 1996.
The relevant points of the Court of Appeal judgment are quoted
in my judgment of 6 February 1998 at pp 17-18. The Court of Appeal
expressly
stated that it made no order as to costs in relation either to the Plaintiff's
successful appeal and the Defendant's successful
cross appeal. The proceedings
were remitted by the Court of Appeal to the Equity Division for proper
determination of the review
of the taxation and its reconsideration. This meant
review of the decision of the Taxing Officer on the reconsideration, under the
then applicable rules being Division 7 of Part 52 of the Rules. This second
category of costs also includes costs incidental to the
relevant proceedings. I
refer to these various costs as "non-review costs".
<P>

(ii)	Deputy Registrar Howe was not a named party to the proceedings nor joined
as such but nonetheless is within the definition
of "party" in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s19</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.
Under that definition, "party" includes "any defendant". "Defendant" is in turn
defined by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s19</a> of that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> as including "any person served with a statement of
claim or summons, or served with notice of or entitled to attend any
proceedings".
But in any event, he is nonetheless amenable to the discretion of
the court to make a cost order as a non-party. The amicus curiae
concurred in
the contention that this result followed from <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> r4(5)(e) of the Rules.
This provides that sub-rule (2), precluding the Court from making an order for
costs against a non-party,
does not apply where the express exception in
r4(5)(e) applies. That exception is to make a cost order "in exercise of [the
court's]
supervisory jurisdiction over its own officers". Clearly enough Deputy
Registrar Howe is included as an "officer", by virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s121.html" class="autolink_findacts">s121(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.
Furthermore, under s76 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, costs are in the discretion of the court and
that discretion extends to awarding costs against a non-party; <i>Knight v F P

Walton</i> (NSWCA, 22 November 1995, unreported) determined that the
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to award costs against a non-party was
to be
determined by looking at the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, the Rules and any other relevant act. Thus
the general power in s76 is limited by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> r4(2) unless within the
exception of r4(5), as is the case here where r4(5)(e) applies.
<P>

(iii)	Though courts should approach such an order with caution and an order
against a non-party will always be exceptional, here
the taxing officer's
connection with the proceeding is sufficiently close and his conduct in the
taxation found to be such as to
warrant the exercise of the discretion to order
costs against him, in the exercise of the court's supervisory jurisdiction over
its
own officers. In particular, the conduct here was constituted by breach of
the rules of natural justice as set out in accordance
with the findings in my
judgment of 6 February 1998.
<P>

(iv)	In addition to the matters set out above, reliance is placed upon such
finding as providing the basis for a finding of misfeasance
in public office by
Deputy Registrar Howe such that costs, by analogy to such a claim for damages
or compensation, should be awarded
against Deputy Registrar Howe. This is both
in the category of review costs and non-review costs.
<P>

(v)	The court's jurisdiction to award costs is based on the amplitude of
jurisdiction conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s23</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> to do that which may be necessary for
the administration of justice in New South Wales assisted by s76 and to the
extent applicable,
the Rules. It is contended that the combination of this
jurisdiction and associated power under the Rules permits the court to make
the
cost orders sought including for non-review costs.
<P>

(vi)	It is contended that Deputy Registrar Howe enjoys neither judicial
immunity nor the protection available to officers of inferior
courts such as
magistrates and justices of the peace nor indeed the immunity granted to
non-judicial officers such as tribunal members,
arbitrators, referees and
witnesses. It is contended that the exercise of the functions of a taxing
officer in a taxation process
is merely "quasi judicial" meaning only that such
functions must be exercised in accordance with natural justice but remain
administrative.
As such he enjoys no immunity.
<P>

(vii)	An order may also be sought under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sfa1951176/" class="autolink_findacts">Suitors' Fund Act</i> 1951</a>
(NSW), even if it be the case that the terms of that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> did not strictly apply
by reason of there being no "appeal", or at any rate no appeal against "the
decision of a court"; see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sfa1951176/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s6(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sfa1951176/" class="autolink_findacts">Suitors' Fund Act</a></i>.
<P>

(viii)	Finally, it is contended that the Crown is liable for any cost orders
made against Deputy Registrar Howe, on the basis that
he is a Crown employee
and that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1988193/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss5</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1988193/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">9</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1988193/" class="autolink_findacts">Crown Proceedings Act</i> 1988</a> (NSW) and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrla1983321/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s7</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrla1983321/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act</i> 1983</a> (NSW) directly or by analogy,
apply to remove any impediment there might otherwise be in making an order for
costs also against the
Crown. It is said to be by analogy, as <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrla1983321/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s7</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrla1983321/" class="autolink_findacts">Law
Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act</a></i> deals only with vicarious liability on the
part of a "master" "in respect of a tort committed by his servant ......" and
no tort
is pleaded here.
<P>

16	I have set out Miss Wentworth's argument in skeletal form and now turn to
examining more closely its various links, starting
with the scope of any
potential cost orders, assuming jurisdiction. The jurisdictional conclusion in
(ii) above is, save as indicated,
non-controversial. Clearly enough, subject to
any immunity, there is a limited and exceptional jurisdiction to make a cost
order
against a non-party. However, I do not consider (in the alternative
submission Miss Wentworth makes) that Deputy Registrar Howe was
a "party"
within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s19.html" class="autolink_findacts">s19</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, as a person "served with notice of or entitled to attend
any proceedings". Indeed Miss Wentworth earlier argued strenuously to the
contrary so far as entitlement to attend. All my judgment of 12 September 1996
(at 7) did was to give him the opportunity if he so
chose, to apply to become
an intervenor, a matter, as I then made clear, to be considered at the time if
he did so. He was never
formally served with notice of the proceedings but
rather at my direction given copies of the relevant materials. But nothing
hangs
on that, as the jurisdiction point is otherwise made out.
<P>

<b><i>Scope of Potential Cost Orders</i></b>
<P>

17	So far as review costs are concerned, on the reasons earlier set out, it is
clear enough that this Court has <i>jurisdiction</i> to award such costs
against a non-party, in the sense of a person who is not formally a party to
the proceedings.
<P>

18	But non-review costs are in an entirely different category. Self-evidently,
a single judge of this Court could not add to or
vary any cost order made by
the Court of Appeal, such as, for example, that made in the judgment to which I
have earlier made reference,
delivered on 21 February 1996. There the Court of
Appeal declined to make any order as to costs in relation either to Miss
Wentworth's
appeal or the Defendant's cross-appeal. As was said by Gaudron J in
the context of an application for special leave to appeal in
<i>Leila Shaw</i>
<i>v John Crichton and Neil Crichton</i> ([1999] HCA <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">S101/98</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">12</a> March 1999)
para 55:
<P>

	"...... court orders are not subject to attack in collateral proceedings; more
particularly, given the court's hierarchy, orders
of this Court are not subject
to collateral attack in inferior courts"
<P>

Gaudron J referred to this as a well established principle. Indeed it is
axiomatic and applies mutatis mutandis to a single judge
of this court in
relation to the Court of Appeal.
<P>

19	The remaining non-review costs, namely those in respect of the appearances
before Deputy Registrar Howe and costs incidental
thereto, arise for
consideration in the exercise of this Court's supervisory jurisdiction over its
own officers. The present proceedings
cannot, as I say in my earlier judgment
of 6 February 1998, be in any sense a review within the Rules nor an appeal.
Rather they
arise under the inherent power of this Court to review a taxing
officer's decision "for the Court always retains to itself power
to supervise
and control the authority which it delegates to its Taxing Officers ......";
see <i>Wentworth v Wentworth</i> (NSWCA, 21 February 1996, unreported) per
Clarke JA at 8 cited at page 24 of my judgment of 6 February 1998.
<P>

20	Dealing with the items comprised in the non-review costs that did not
involve appearances before the Court of Appeal, it is clear
from the Court of
Appeal judgment, in particular Clarke JA's criticism that Miss Wentworth
embarked on that attack before the Master
without first seeking a
reconsideration of the taxation before the Taxing Officer, that the Court of
Appeal not only did not but
would not have awarded any costs in relation to
those applications comprised in the collateral attack; see Clarke JA at 10
quoted
at page 17 of my judgment of 6 February 1998. I see no basis for my
doing otherwise.
<P>

21	Thus what remains to be considered in the non-review costs is the actual
conduct of the taxation before Deputy Registrar Howe.
The jurisdiction to award
costs finds its ultimate source in s76 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> where the expression "costs"
is defined in s76(2) in these terms:
<P>

"(2)	In subsection (1) the expression "costs" includes -- 
<P>

(a)	costs of or incidental to proceedings in the Court, including the
administration of estates and trusts;
<P>

(b)	in the case of an appeal to the Court, the costs of or incidental to the
proceedings giving rise to the appeal as well as the
costs of or incidental to
the appeal; and
<P>

(c)	in the case of proceedings transferred to or removed into the Court, the
costs of or incidental to the whole proceedings, both
before and after the
transfer or removal."
<P>

22	The last two categories of costs in paras (b) and (c) quoted above clearly
could not include non-review costs. There is no appeal
to the Court, for the
reasons earlier set out nor a transfer or removal to the Court. The first
category, that of costs "of or incidental
to proceedings in the court", is
capable of catching costs in the taxation, being costs incidental to
proceedings in this Court in
which the relevant cost orders were made.
Furthermore, the definition of costs is an inclusive one. It is capable of
covering categories
of costs cognate with those expressly described, such as a
costs of the taxation before Deputy Registrar Howe.
<P>

23	There is also a powerful <i>argumentum ab inconvenienti</i>. To conclude
otherwise would mean that such costs would fall into a black hole where they
can never be recovered despite setting
aside the taxation and whatever may
follow in regard to the future conduct of the taxation.
<P>

24	It would be a surprising conclusion that the Court's power of supervision
did not extend to a jurisdiction to making cost orders
against a court officer
in a proper case where that court officer exercises a function which is
incidental to proceedings in the
court.
<P>

<b><i>Discretion in relation to costs against a non-party;
Principles</i></b>
<P>

25	That there be jurisdiction to award costs does not of course mean that the
discretion so to do should be exercised. It is convenient
that I now turn to
those considerations that should affect an exercise of that discretion. 
<P>

26	Turning now to the question of discretion in relation to awarding costs
against a non-party, I first set out some governing principles.
<P>

(1)	The discretion is to be exercised "judicially and in accordance with
general legal principles pertaining to the law of costs";
<i>Knight v F P
Special Assets Ltd</i> (supra) at 192 per Mason and Deane JJ; <i>Vestris v
Cashman</i> [1998] SCSA S6852 at 21.
<P>

(2)	The context of the particular exercise of discretion is likely to be
critical; here that context is the exercise by the court
of "its supervisory
jurisdiction over its own officer" and that in turn is affected by whether
immunity is available for that officer
in exercising the function he does,
depending on whether judicial, quasi-judicial, or merely administrative.
<P>

(3)	A connection with a judicial proceeding in which the cost order is to be
made is a necessary condition of the proper exercise
of the jurisdiction or
power; <i>Burns Philp &amp; Co Ltd v Bhagat </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1993/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] VicRp 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%201%20VR%20203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 1 VR 203</a> at 219;
<i>Bischof v Adams </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1992/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] VicRp 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%202%20VR%20198" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 2 VR 198</a>; <i>Vestris v Cashman </i>(supra); <i>C
E Heath Underwriting and Insurance (Australia) Pty Ltd v Daraway Constructions
Pty Ltd </i>(SC(Vic), Batt J, 1 September 1995, unreported)
<P>

(4)	There must be a causal connection between the non-party and the occasion
for ordering costs; <i>Bischof v Adams</i> (supra); <i>C E Heath Underwriting
&amp; Insurance (Australia) Pty Ltd  v Daraway Constructions Pty Ltd</i>
(supra); <i>Vestris v Cashman</i>.
<P>

(5)	Improper conduct of a non-party may be a factor, but is not a necessary
feature; see <i>Vestris v Cashman</i>.
<P>

(6)	The existence of an immunity from suit; <i>Symphony Group Plc v Hodgson</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1994%5d%20QB%20179" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1994] QB 179</a> at 192H; <i>Najjar v Haines</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2025%20NSWLR%20224" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 25 NSWLR 224</a> at 249F; the
nature of the immunity sought and the category or status of the person seeking
that immunity, for example whether the
immunity is from some form of civil
action such as defamation or is in relation to a witness; nonetheless the
immunity may share
a common basis of policy and principle such as giving effect
to the public interest in securing the utmost freedom to those who preside
over
judicial proceedings, subject only to the constitutional or other remedies for
removal from office; see <i>Mann v O'Neill</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%2d97%29%20191%20CLR%20204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996-97) 191 CLR 204</a> at 239 per
Gummow J.
<P>

(7)	Related to the public interest in securing the utmost freedom to those who
preside over judicial proceedings, is the underlying
policy that those required
to exercise judicial functions should have freedom to speak and act without
fear of reprisal, with the
corollary that it will be subverted if, while the
author is free from attack, his or her subordinates in the form of officers of
the court required to record and dispatch the judge's decisions are not
protected; see <i>Crispin v Registrar of the District Court</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%202%20NZLR%20246" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 2 NZLR
246</a> at 252. 
<P>

(8)	Finally, an order against a non-party should be approached by the court
with caution; C <i>E Heath Underwriting and Insurance (Australia) Pty Ltd v
Daraway Constructions Pty Ltd</i> and an order against a non-party will always
be exceptional; <i>Symphony Group Plc v Hodgson</i> (supra) at 192H; <i>Aiden
Shipping Co Ltd v Interbulk Ltd</i> (supra) at 980F; per Clarke JA; <i>Najjar v
Haines</i> (supra) per Clarke JA at 249 in relation to appeal proceedings;
<i>Vestris v Cashman</i>.
<P>

<b><i>Characterising the functions of a Taxation Officer -- Judicial or
Derivative Immunity and at what level?</i></b>
<P>

27	Turning from general principles or factors affecting the exercise of the
discretion, it is first necessary to characterise the
functions exercised by
the Deputy Registrar when carrying out a taxation. Are those functions to be
characterised as judicial or
quasi-judicial, and, if so, do they give rise to
immunity at the level of a superior court or non-superior court? Or are the
functions
to be characterised as wholly administrative, enjoying no immunity
though referred to as quasi-judicial? 
<P>

28	I deal first with immunity in general terms. Three categories of immunity
emerge from the cases. For convenience I shall call
them "absolute immunity" as
applicable to a superior court, "qualified immunity" as applicable to a
inferior court, and "derivative
immunity" from connection to, or analogy with,
a judicial proceeding. 
<P>

<b><i>Absolute Immunity</i></b>
<P>

29	This immunity of judicial officers of superior courts has been described as
a "well established immunity from suit which protects
judicial officers from
actions arising out of acts done in the exercise of their judicial function or
capacity"; see <i>Re East; ex parte Nguyen</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/73.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 73</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20159%20ALR%20108" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 159 ALR 108.</a>
<P>

30	In <i>Sirros v Moore</i> the majority of the Court of Appeal stated as a
broad principle that all judicial officers, in both superior and inferior
courts,
should be immune from suit except where he [or she] knowingly acts
outside jurisdiction (at 136, 149).  The extension of the principle
to all
judicial officers is certainly not settled in this country. Indeed in the case
of magistrates a different, qualified immunity
obtains at common law, as I
explain shortly. <i>Sirros</i> itself concerned the action of a High Court
judge. Lord Buckley, who was in the minority, would have restricted the
principle only
to a justice of a superior court. 
<P>

31	<i>Sirros</i> has been acknowledged by the New South Wales Court of Appeal
in cases dealing with the judicial immunity of superior court judges:
see
<i>Attorney-General for New South Wales v Agarsky</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%206%20NSWLR%2038" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 6 NSWLR 38</a>, a
brief judgment by Kirby P (as he then was) upon which he elaborated in
<i>Rajski v Powell</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2011%20NSWLR%20522" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 11 NSWLR 522.</a> In <i>Rajski v Powell</i> Priestley
JA noted that Kirby P's formulation of the principle in <i>Agarsky</i> (supra)
suggested that judges must always act in good faith.  His view (at 528), with
which Hope JA agreed, was that the issue of
`good faith' arises with judges of
superior courts only where they act, in fact, outside their jurisdiction and
then only in the
limited sense explained. Thus as Kirby P explained (at 532)
"jurisdiction" in judicial immunity cases refers to the "broad and general
authority" conferred upon the court and upon the judge to hear and determine
issues. He cites Woodhouse J in <i>Nakhla v McCarthy</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%201%20NZLR%20291" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 1 NZLR 291</a> (at
301) where the latter says: "`Authority to decide' is the test, not the mode of
the decision nor the  manner in which the powers...
have been exercised or not
exercised." This concept of jurisdiction is quite different from that used in
judicial review proceedings.
The cases thus suggest that <i>Sirros</i> to that
limited extent only qualifies the traditional immunity in requiring that the
judge must honestly believe he or she is exercising
jurisdiction: see <i>Moll v
Butler</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%204%20NSWLR%20231" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 4 NSWLR 231</a>; <i>Rajski v Powell</i>. <i>Rajski v Powell</i>,
along with the absolute privilege in defamation upheld in <i>Mann v O'Neill</i>
(supra) was cited by the High Court in <i>Re East; ex parte Nguyen</i> (supra)
at 115 as an authority for the general immunity.
<P>

<b><i>Qualified Immunity -- the Common Law Protection for
Magistrates</i></b>
<P>

32	The traditional common law position with respect to magistrates is that
costs will not be awarded against a magistrate "unless
he has been perverse,
guilty of corruption or gross ignorance or similar serious misconduct": <i>Ex
parte Blume &amp; Anor</i>; <i>Re Osborn &amp; Ors</i> (supra); <i>Anstee v
Werry</i> (supra). While a case of apparent, as distinct from actual, bias
would not be expected to rise to the level where immunity was lost,
an extreme
case of breach of the rules of natural justice might conceivably do so in
refusing to hear <i>at all</i> from a party; see <i>Ex parte Taylor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281924%29%2041%20WN%28NSW%29%2081" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1924)
41 WN(NSW) 81.</a> That case should be contrasted with <i>Cummins v McKenzie</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%202%20NSWLR%20803" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 2 NSWLR 803</a> where Sheppard J, in an application based on denial of
natural justice, itself based on a misconception of the law falling not far
short of gross ignorance, declined to award costs against the magistrate,
despite hardship to the applicant in having to bear the
costs of putting right
an injustice. He cited <i>Ex parte Vincent</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281900%29%206%20WN%28NSW%29%20215" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1900) 6 WN(NSW) 215</a>, where no
cost order was made despite what the court there characterised as an astounding
blunder. The situation in <i>Ex parte Taylor</i> (supra) is in any event
distinct from what occurred in <i>Wentworth</i> where the refusal to hear was
much more limited, though in a respect sufficient to give rise to a finding of
apparent bias.
<P>

33	The extension in <i>Sirros</i> of the common law principle of judicial
immunity to judicial officers of inferior courts such as magistrates has been
doubted by
members of the  House of Lords in <i>McC v Mullan</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%203%20All%20ER%20908" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 3 All
ER 908</a> eg per Lord Bridge at 923. More recently in <i>Warren v Warren</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%203%20WLR%201129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 3 WLR 1129</a>, a case concerned with the compellability of a district court
judge in the UK, Lord Woolf with whom Butler-Sloss LJ and Saville LJ
agreed,
approved Lord Bridge's refusal in <i>McC</i> (supra) to follow Lord Denning in
<i>Sirros</i> in "sweeping away" any distinctions between magistrates and other
judges. 
<P>

34	This extension of immunity to all judges and judicial officers has not as
yet been addressed squarely by New South Wales courts.
The Court of Appeal in
<i>Spautz v Butterworth</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2041%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 41 NSWLR 1</a> (a case concerning protection for
a magistrate who had issued a warrant outside his jurisdiction) did not decide
the point on the
basis the ground was not taken in the court below; see
<i>Spautz v Dempsey</i> (NSWSC, Young J, 27 April 1993, unreported). Statutory
protection under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s144.html" class="autolink_findacts">s144</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</i> 1902</a> (NSW) was, in any event,
available in the circumstances.
<P>

<b><i>Derivative Immunity</i></b>
<P>

35	This species of immunity is closely akin to what might be termed immunity by
analogy so I have, for convenience, grouped the
two together. In immunity by
analogy what confers the immunity on a non-judicial body such as a board of
inquiry is close similarity
to, rather than connection with, judicial
proceedings. This is illustrated by <i>Tampion v Anderson</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1973/32.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1973] VicRp 32</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1973%5d%20VR%20321" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1973] VR 321.</a>
There McInerney J determined that judicial immunity from defamation proceedings
had been extended by analogy to "persons presiding
at or constituting a
tribunal authorised by law to conduct an inquiry proceeding judicially, that is
to say in a manner as nearly
as possible similar to that in which a court of
justice acts in respect of an inquiry before it".
<P>

36	In the United Kingdom, <i>Trapp v Mackie</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%201%20WLR%20377" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 1 WLR 377</a> concerned the
immunity of a witness from an action in defamation in an inquiry into the
dismissal of a headmaster.  It followed a
line of cases which assert that the
factor affording absolute privilege to witnesses (amongst others) is the
similarity of the proceedings
in question to a court of justice.  Lord Diplock
set out four considerations which indicate whether a proceeding would attract
an
absolute rather than a qualified privilege.  These are:
<P>

(i)	under what authority the tribunal acts,
<P>

(ii)	the nature of the question into which it is its duty to inquire,
<P>

(iii)	the procedure adopted by it in carrying out the inquiry,
<P>

(iv)	the legal consequences of the conclusion reached by the tribunal as a
result of the inquiry.
<P>

37	Further the proceeding must be "recognised by law". What this means was not
expanded upon since the inquiry was constituted under
an <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> of Parliament. The
Board of inquiry in <i>Trapp v Mackie</i> (supra) was said to be no different
from a civil proceeding in a court. McHugh J discussed these considerations in
<i>Mann v O'Neill</i>.
<P>

38	Other examples of immunity by analogy include:  local councils acting quasi-
judicially insofar as owing no duty of care: <i>Smaill v Buller District
Council</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20NZLR%20190" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 NZLR 190</a>; <i>Welbridge Holdings Ltd v Metropolitan
Corporation of Greater Winnipeg</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%2022%20DLR%20%283d%29%20470" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 22 DLR (3d) 470</a> 
<P>

39	Likewise proceedings undertaken by an arbitrator which are akin to a
judicial proceeding may be protected depending on the precise
ambit of the
arbitrator's role. Thus in <i>Arenson v Casson Beckman Rutley &amp; Co</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%20AC%20405" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] AC 405</a> at 423 (a case about an auditor acting as valuer and claiming
immunity as if an arbitrator) it was said that the essence of a judicial
decision is that it "decides a dispute" (at 424). "[T]he essential prerequisite
for him to claim immunity as an arbitrator is that,
by the time the matter is
submitted to him for decision, there should be a formulated dispute between at
least two parties which
his decision is required to resolve.  It is not enough
that the parties who may be affected by the decision have opposed interests
-
still less that the decision is on a matter which is not agreed between them".
An auditor in the role of a valuer of shares was
not, unlike an arbitrator,
immune from a negligence suit.  An architect engaged to issue interim
certificates was likewise held to
be not acting judicially; <i>Sutcliffe v
Thackrah</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20AC%20727" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] AC 727</a> at 735, 744.
<P>

40	However, the referee in <i>Najjar v Haines</i> was found by Kirby P and
Rogers AJA to have immunity from suit on the basis that the report provided by
the referee was integral
to the decision making process of the judge.  Clarke
JA allowed an immunity "at least where there is no question of fraud or good
faith involved" (at 250).
<P>

41	A churchwarden acting as a returning officer was said to have duties which
were "neither entirely ministerial nor wholly judicial"
and the exercise of his
judgment or discretion in the admission or rejection of votes required immunity
from action (500 possible
actions it was said) so that he could perform his
duties. The court determined that malice was necessary to found an action;
<i>Tozer v Child</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1857/236.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1857] EngR 236</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281857%29%207%20E%20%26%20B%20377" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1857) 7 EL &amp; BL 377</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=119%20ER%201286" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">119 ER 1286</a>; applying <i>Cullen
v Morris</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1816/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1816] EngR 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281813%29%202%20Stark%20577" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1813) 2 Stark 577</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=171%20ER%20741" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">171 ER 741.</a> These cases rest on a distinction
between acting ministerially, that is to say essentially without discretion,
and acting judicially,
that is to say with a discretion -- but not with a
discretion at large, as by reference merely to the public interest, which
rather
points to an administrative function; compare the Takeover Panel under
the corporations legislation in <i>Precision Data Holdings Ltd v Wills</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20173%20CLR%20167" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 173 CLR 167.</a> 
<P>

42	Finally, the general council of the Royal College of Surgeons, which acted
under statutory powers, was held immune from action
in the absence of malice
after it directed the registrar of the dentists' register to remove the name of
a dentist from the register
without allowing him to explain the withdrawal of
his diploma in dental surgery in <i>Partridge v The General Council of Medical
Education and Registration of the United Kingdom</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281890%29%2025%20QBD%2090" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1890) 25 QBD 90.</a>  The
case was decided on the basis that this was not "merely a ministerial act" but
the act of a body upon which was imposed a public
duty to exercise a discretion
and they would not be liable for an erroneous exercise of that discretion.
<P>

43	I turn now to the other species of derivative immunity, where functions or
powers are exercised which are ancillary or incidental
to the exercise of
judicial power, or collateral to it. Thus in the context of division of powers,
<i>Gould v Brown</i> (1997-98) 151 ALR 395 per Brennan CJ and Toohey J at 412;
per Gaudron J 426 and per Kirby J at 503 concluded that non-judicial functions
may be sufficiently "incidental" to the exercise of judicial power so as to
stamp them with a judicial character. For example a Registrar
conducting an
examination under court supervision of a witness for the purpose of a court
winding up, though not determining the
rights and liabilities of adversaries,
is nonetheless exercising a function incidental to the judicial power to wind
up so as to
share its judicial character, though not strictly judicial.
<P>

44	Another illustration of derivative immunity, not in a division of powers
context, but rather in defamation, comes from the New
Zealand case of
<i>Crispin v Registrar of the District Court</i> (supra). A Registrar who
mistakenly entered judgment against the wrong party of the same name was held
immune from defamation proceedings.
This was either on the basis that the act
in question (entry of judgment) was a judicial act (at 251) or, even if it was
not, was
nonetheless, as an administrative act, covered by judicial immunity
because collateral to a judicial proceeding. The policy basis
was the judge's
necessary freedom to speak and act without fetter of reprisal, which must
necessarily extend to the court's subordinate
staff.
<P>

45	That case can be contrasted with the position of the Registrar of the High
Court of New Zealand, who was, in <i>Seatrans (Fiji) Ltd v Attorney-General</i>
<a href="http://www.nzlii.org/nz/cases/NZHC/1986/42.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] NZHC 42</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%202%20NZLR%20240" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 2 NZLR 240</a>, held to owe a duty of care to act upon an order of the Court
to pay a specified amount into an interest-bearing account after it
had been
paid into court. Carrying out the order was said to be "neither a
responsibility of a judicial nature, nor would it be in
connection with the
execution of the judicial process". A distinction clearly lies between such an
administrative act -- neither
analogous to a judicial process nor sufficiently
connected to it -- and the taxation function.
<P>

46	That immunity, being derivative, should find its level by reference to the
judicial process with which it is connected or compared.
Where, as here,
taxation is connected to a Supreme Court proceeding, this means it would find
its level at the level of a superior
court.
<P>

47	An alternative approach to ascertaining the level of immunity in a
derivative context lies in identifying the public interest
or basis of
principle underpinning judicial immunity and then asking: what level of
immunity is necessary to serve that interest
or basis of principle in the
context in which the question of immunity arises. That interest or basis of
principle has been expressed
in the following ways:
<P>

(i)	"to preserve the integrity, independence and resolve of the judiciary, and
to ensure that justice may be administered by such
judges in the courts,
independently and on the basis of their unbiased opinion - not influenced by
any apprehension of personal consequences";
<i>Rajski v Powell</i> per Kirby P
at 528.
<P>

(ii)	to give "effect to the particular public interest in securing the utmost
freedom to those who preside over judicial proceedings,
subject only to the
constitutional or other remedies for removal from office." <i>Mann v
O'Neill</i> per Gummow J at 239-240.
<P>

(iii)	permitting civil liability attaching to persons involved in civil
proceedings "would impede enquiry as to the truth and justice
of the matter and
jeopardise the `safe administration of justice'": <i>Mann v O'Neill</i> per
Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron JJ at 213; whilst the overriding
consideration in respect of whether or not an absolute privilege
against
defamation will attach is `whether there will emerge from the proceedings a
determination the truth and justice of which
is a matter of public concern"
(<i>Mann v O'Neill</i> at 212 citing <i>Lincoln v Daniels</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1962%5d%201%20QB%20237" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1962] 1 QB 237</a>
per Devlin LJ at 255-256).
<P>

(iv)	to prevent harassment of judicial officers by vexatious litigation by
litigants not able to accept the finality of decisions
against them: <i>McC</i>
at 916; <i>Rawlinson v Rice</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%201%20NZLR%20454" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 1 NZLR 454</a> at 464
<P>

48	Application of that basis of principle gives this answer in the present
context. The prospect of being sued unjustifiably for
apparent bias, either in
damages or for costs, could have a serious inhibiting effect on a court
official doing his or her duty fearlessly
and independently. It is enough for
the safe administration of justice in the case of apparent bias, that
disqualification can result.
That safe administration may be jeopardised by
tempting vexatious litigation with the prospect of cost orders and civil
liability.
Just as importantly, the court official, like the tribunal, will
typically and properly, as in the present case, have played no role
in
contesting the application for disqualification, under the self-denying
<i>Hardiman</i> principle. Thus, as I said in my judgment of 12 September 1996
(NSWSC Santow J, 12 September 1996, unreported):
<P>

"In cases where prerogative relief is sought on the basis of an apprehension of
bias of a member of a Tribunal, the member is named
as a party as he or she is
the person whom it is sought to prohibit: <i>Re JRL; Ex Parte CJL</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20161%20CLR%20342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986)
161 CLR 342.</a> But even in such cases the Tribunal member does not take an active
part in the proceedings and any attempts by the Tribunal to do
so are
discouraged on the basis that if the member becomes actively involved in the
proceedings, there is a risk that his or her
impartiality in the subsequent
proceedings may be endangered: <i>R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal Ex Parte
Hardiman</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1980/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20144%20CLR%2013" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 144 CLR 13</a> at 35-36; <i>Commonwealth of Australia v Human
Rights &amp; Equal Opportunity Commission</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20133%20ALR%20629" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 133 ALR 629</a> at 639-641.
<P>

More fundamentally, such an active involvement is unnecessary if not
inappropriate given the principle of judicial immunity by which
judges are
immune from liability for damages for acts committed within their judicial
jurisdiction, even where the judge is accused
of acting maliciously. As Kirby
P(as he then was) pointed out in <i>Rajski v Powell</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2011%20NSWLR%20522" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 11 NSWLR 522</a> at
535, apart from history and authority, there are ample policy reasons in the
public interest based on judicial independence supporting
such an immunity,
including the fact that otherwise it would leave the Judge open to costs orders
against him or her."
<P>

49	It would be unfair to maintain the <i>Hardiman</i> principle if the public
official or tribunal were vulnerable to cost orders or damages. That was
expressly recognised by Wilcox J
in denying an application that the Australian
Broadcasting Tribunal be ordered to pay the costs of a successful party seeking
judicial
review of its decision; <i>Our Town FM Pty Ltd v Australian
Broadcasting Tribunal &amp; Anor (No. 3)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1987/393.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] FCA 393</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2077%20ALR%20609" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 77 ALR 609</a> at 611. Wilcox J
found that although the Tribunal's error had been a cause of the applicant
incurring costs, it would only be in
an exceptional case proper to order the
Tribunal to pay those costs.
<P>

50	As was said by Mahoney AP in <i>Garrard v Email Furniture Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2032%20NSWLR%20662" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993)
32 NSWLR 662</a>, the taxation process is judicial or quasi-judicial involving the
exercise of discretion. Handley JA in <i>Attorney-General for New South Wales v
Kennedy Miller Television</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20729" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 729</a> at 739 considered that an
assessor assessing costs under the new costs regime to be exercising a judicial
function, though this had
been contrary to the assumption made at trial and
before the Court of Appeal. I do not consider that Mahoney AP was using the
qualifying
word "quasi" simply to state, in loose terms, that the rules of
natural justice were to be applied, whilst insisting the function
exercised was
merely administrative. 
<P>

51	Clearly enough, the taxation process is not a wholly judicial function. Thus
the taxation certificate can neither constitute
a final judgment or order, nor
an order for payment of a sum of money (<i>Re Cartwright; ex parte Cartwright v
Barker</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%201%20WLR%20573" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 1 WLR 573</a> followed in <i>Wilmot v Buckley</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1984/327.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] FCA 327</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%202%20FCR%20540" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 2 FCR
540</a> and later Federal Court cases in the bankruptcy context). Rather liability
depends upon a separate order for costs for the source
of liability is always
the original order or judgment. But while the taxing officer's certificate is
rendered enforceable by the
court order, it in turn is an incident of the court
order, necessary to quantify the recoverable costs in terms of that order. It
does so as an integral part of the court's processes. Thus Handley JA in
<i>Attorney-General for New South Wales v Kennedy Miller Television</i> (supra)
at 739:
<P>

"Costs orders had been made in favour of Kennedy Miller which created
obligations in the nature of contingent debt. Certificates
of the costs
assessor quantified these obligations, subject to appeal, and those
certificates also enable the judgment creditor to
fix the date on which the
debt becomes payable.
<P>

The process of assessment under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> and the Regulation thus enables the
inchoate or contingent obligation created by a court order to be converted into
a legally enforceable
judgment debt. It seems to me therefore that a costs
assessor in assessing party and party costs is determining or at least working
out the legal rights and duties of the parties under an order of the court and
must therefore be exercising a judicial function."
<P>

52	In the same way an examination order connected with a winding-up carried out
by a registrar is an integral part of the court's
processes. It occurs under
the supervision of the court as an incident of the judicial process of a
winding-up. "Although a function
might be characterised as administrative if
conferred upon an administrative agency, a corresponding function might be
characterised
as judicial if conferred upon a court"; <i>Gould v Brown</i>
(supra) at 413 citing <i>R v Davison</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1954/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1954] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281954%29%2090%20CLR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1954) 90 CLR 353.</a> While the taxing
officer is not a judicial officer, clearly enough his or her functions are
conferred on that officer as an officer
of the court. This not in the sense
that a solicitor or barrister is an officer of the court but as someone who is
part of its structure.
<P>

53	Summing up: a taxing officer engaged in a taxation under the applicable
Rules enjoys derivative immunity as for a judicial officer
of a superior court
rather than at the qualified level of immunity of a magistrate at common law.
This is either 
<P>

(a)	by reason of connection with the judicial proceedings in this Court as a
superior court under which the relevant cost orders
were made, that are then
quantified by the taxation certificate, or
<P>

(b)	by reason of the taxation process being analogous to the judicial process,
in replicating a judicial adjudication in which competing
contentions are
determined by applying the law to the facts as found, with its location at the
level of a superior court being justified
both by its connection to a superior
court judicial process ((a) above) and this best serving the public interest
underlying such
immunity. 
<P>

That the taxation certificate still depends upon the judgment or cost orders
for enforcement does not alter this result. Such immunity
best serves the basis
of principle underlying judicial immunity in the present context. I deal later
with the consequence of that
conclusion for the availability of cost orders
against Deputy Registrar Howe, in the circumstances where his determinations
have
been set aside for apparent bias on the grounds elaborated in my judgment
of 6 February 1998.
<P>

54	Finally, it is said that principles applicable to misfeasance in public
office should apply by analogy, so as to render Deputy
Registrar Howe amenable
to a cost order. Such a proposition presupposes that either he has no immunity,
or the level of immunity
is not such as to justify protecting him in the
circumstances of my earlier findings. Leaving aside the question of immunity,
in
circumstances where no such action has been brought, can such principles
have any conceivable application here if only by analogy?
The answer lies in
the restricted scope of the tort itself.
<P>

55	It was said in <i>Northern Territory v Mengel</i> (1995) 185 CLR 307 and
subsequently approved in <i>Sanders v Snell</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/64.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] HCA 64</a> that while the
precise limits of this tort are still undefined, it is an intentional tort.
Thus "the weight of authority here and
in the United Kingdom is clearly to the
effect that it is a deliberate tort in the sense that there is no liability
unless either
there is an intention to cause harm or the officer concerned
knowingly acts in excess of his or her power." (at 345). For the purpose
of
deciding <i>Mengel</i> (supra), the majority considered it sufficient to
proceed on the basis that the tort requires an act which the public official
knows
is beyond power and which involves the foreseeable risk of harm. It noted
that there seems to be much to be said for the view that
misfeasance extends to
the situation of a public official recklessly disregarding the means of
ascertaining the extent of his or
her power; <i>Mengel</i> at 347.
<P>

56	In <i>Sanders v Snell</i> (supra) at 37 it is recognised that "inappropriate
imposition of liability on public officials may deter officials from exercising
powers conferred on them when their exercise would be for the public good". But
"too narrow a definition of the ambit of liability
may leave persons affected
by an abuse of public power uncompensated. The tort of misfeasance in public
office must seek to balance
these competing considerations."; per Gleeson CJ
and Gaudron, Kirby and Haine JJ.
<P>

57	My judgment of 6 February 1998 has no finding of any deliberate
contravention of the rules of natural justice. There is likewise
no finding
that the taxing officer deliberately acted beyond power. There is furthermore
no finding of actual bias but only a reasonable
apprehension of the possibility
of bias. Thus any analogy based upon the tort of misfeasance in public office
to justify a cost order
against Deputy Registrar Howe would not be justified,
even were there no immunity. And as I have earlier concluded, there is
immunity.
<P>

58	I am satisfied that the findings made in my judgment of 6 February 1998 are
not such as to justify any order for costs against
Deputy Registrar Howe
whether review costs or, to the extent capable of being made, any non-review
costs. No order for costs could
in any event be made in relation either to the
Court of Appeal or contrary to its determination. That conclusion follows
whether
the level of protection of his derivative immunity is taken to be that
applicable to an officer of a superior court or an inferior
court such as a
magistrate at common law, though the former is considered the appropriate
level.
<P>

59	In these circumstances, the question of any potential liability of the Crown
in right of New South Wales does not arise. But
in any event the Crown is
clearly not an officer of the court. It cannot be made amenable to an order for
costs in the present proceedings,
in light of the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 52A</a> r4 and
the decision in <i>Leicester v Walton</i> (supra). I should add that in
<i>Attorney General for New South Wales v Agarsky</i>, the Court of Appeal
considered an application that the Attorney-General was liable in damages for
the wrongful acts of certain judges
and magistrates in New South Wales. In
striking out the claim, the court found that an action is not maintainable
where judicial
officers act in good faith in the performance of their judicial
duties. However, the proposition that the Attorney-General was liable
for the
conduct of judicial officers was also rejected.
<P>

<b>Second Issue -- Defendant's position in relation to Cost Orders.</b>
<P>

60	Can and should any order for costs be made against the Defendant, Mr Peter
Wentworth, and, if so, what is the proper scope of
such cost order having
regard to the answer to the previous question?
<P>

61	In my earlier judgment of 6 February 1998, I concluded (at 62) that no order
should be made that the Defendant pay the costs
of the Plaintiff for the whole
of the taxation process to date including the cost of all applications which
have arisen to date from
the entire failure of the taxation process, on an
indemnity basis. I did so for reasons which I have earlier repeated at the
commencement
of this judgment. The reasons I gave related to an order for costs
of the breadth thus described. I consider that no cost order of
the breadth
sought by the Plaintiff should be countenanced.
<P>

62	However, the question remains whether the Plaintiff should be entitled to a
more limited cost order for what I have described
as the review costs only and,
if so, on what basis. The Plaintiff correctly points out that the Defendant
resisted the contention
of the Plaintiff that the taxing officer's
determinations were vitiated by bias, or the appearance of bias. In the result,
the determinations
of Deputy Registrar Howe were set aside on the basis of
apparent bias in the manner I have described. The Defendant played an active
part in the proceedings up to 15 July 1997, resisting any such contention.
Thereafter the Defendant played no active part in the
proceedings, though not
in any way waiving or withdrawing his opposition to any such orders.
<P>

63	On consideration, I am satisfied that there is a sufficient case for a more
limited cost order, but only for the period to 15
July 1997, when the Defendant
ceased any active part in the proceedings. It is true, as I have said, that his
attitude to the litigation
did not change from one of opposition to the relief
claimed by the Plaintiff, strenuously asserted in that earlier stage, to one
of
submission to any order the court might make. That he did not is perhaps
understandable, given the fact that the Plaintiff for
her part, did not retreat
in any way from the extremity of her application to have the Defendant pay the
whole of the costs of the
taxation and on an indemnity basis. The argument that
I set out in my judgment of 6 February 1998, to the effect that the Plaintiff
would be put to proof in any event, whether the Defendant had played a role or
not in the initial stages of the present proceedings,
is however to my mind
also an important consideration. Precisely the same costs could have been
anticipated in testing the Plaintiff's
contentions had the Defendant at that
point consented to any order the Court might make. This is because the Court
was asked to hear
evidence and submissions on a number of allegations by Miss
Wentworth, some very serious ones, before determining those matters which
were
necessary to resolve in order to determine whether the taxation officer's
determinations should be set aside in whole or in
part. Thus I would make no
order for costs in relation to the period after 15 July 1997 when the Defendant
played no part in extending
the proceedings.
<P>

64	As to costs prior to 15 July 1997, so far as related to the review, it is
fair to say that the Plaintiff's bias application was
not of course an action
against the Defendant in the conventional sense. However, the relief sought by
the Plaintiff was the setting
aside of orders that had been made by the taxing
officer and of which the Defendant had the benefit. It could be said that the
nature
of the bias application, though in law not an appeal but a review, did
in some respects do what an appeal might have done, in focusing
necessarily
upon the conduct of the adjudicator rather than the Defendant. Nonetheless, the
Defendant adopted an uncompromising adversarial
role which would in the earlier
stage have extended the proceedings to that date. A Defence was filed and a
Notice of Objection was
given to portions of the evidence filed by the
Plaintiff. The Defendant did not appear at the hearing but did appear at
several of
the interlocutory stages and also made detailed written submissions
opposing the Plaintiff's application on a number of grounds,
all of which were
ultimately unsuccessful. A more detailed elaboration of steps taken by the
Defendant is set out between pages 6
to 10 of my judgment of 6 February 1998
and indicates the way the Defendant dealt with these matters.
<P>

65	In all the circumstances, I consider that the proper cost order to be made
is that the Defendant should pay the Plaintiff's review
costs on a party and
party basis up to but not after 15 July 1997 when the Defendant took no further
part in the proceedings. So
far as earlier costs of the taxation are concerned,
not attributable to the Court of Appeal or otherwise in conflict with its
orders
and thus not including any collateral attack as described in paras 18
and 20 of this judgment, I would give leave for either party
to make
application in relation to such costs, but only after the completion of the
further assessment pursuant to regulation 80,
as elaborated in paras 66 to 68
of this judgment.
<P>

<b>Third Issue -- Future Conduct of the Taxation</b>
<P>

66	The third issue is not controversial. The Plaintiff does not take issue with
the submission by Dr Birch as amicus curiae, that
the matter is dealt with by
the Legal Profession Regulations 1994 and in particular by regulation 80. This
is in the following terms:
<P>

"(1)	This clause applies to costs which were the subject of a bill given to a
client (or which were the subject of an order of a
court or tribunal made)
before 1 July 1994.
<P>

(2)	The former taxation provisions continue to apply (and new <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p11" class="autolink_findacts">Part 11</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> does not apply) in respect of costs if application is made before 1 July
1995, whether for the taxation or assessment of the costs.
<P>

(3)	If, however, application is made on or after 1 July 1995 (whether for the
taxation or assessment of the costs), the costs are
to be assessed in
accordance with new <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p11" class="autolink_findacts">Part 11</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>. However, the former taxation principles
apply to any such assessment and that Part is to be construed accordingly."
<P>

67	Dr Birch submitted, and I accept, that the matter is thus dealt with by
force of the Regulation rather than requiring a direction
of the court.
Likewise, whether the costs are to be dealt with by taxation or by assessment
appears to depend upon whether one treats
the Plaintiff as making a fresh
application consequent upon the earlier orders that I have made, or whether one
treats whatever taxation
or assessment as now to occur, as pursuant to the
Plaintiff's original application.
<P>

68	I consider that the position at the current moment is that the orders of
Deputy Registrar Howe having been set aside, there is
the necessity for the
Plaintiff to make fresh application in order to invoke the machinery for
determination of the costs unascertained.
That application would be in the
current matter within the terms of Regulation 80(3) with the result that the
determination ought
to be dealt with as an assessment in accordance with the
new <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p11" class="autolink_findacts">Part 11</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</i> 1987</a> (NSW) as amended.
<P>

<b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sfa1951176/" class="autolink_findacts">Suitors' Fund Act</i> 1951</a> (NSW)</b>
<P>

69	There is one final matter and that concerns the possible application of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sfa1951176/" class="autolink_findacts">Suitors' Fund Act</i> 1951</a> (NSW). As I presently see matters, I would be
prepared to contemplate making an order under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sfa1951176/" class="autolink_findacts">Suitors' Fund Act</i> 1951</a>
(NSW) if Miss Wentworth wishes formally to apply for such an order, in relation
to the costs earlier awarded against the Defendant.
However, that must be the
subject of a formal application and I will consider then any matters bearing
upon that question. One immediate
difficulty concerns whether proceedings
before me constitute "an appeal" in the sense used in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sfa1951176/" class="autolink_findacts">Suitors' Fund
Act</i> 1951</a> (NSW) where it is defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sfa1951176/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">s2(1)</a> in these terms:
<P>

	"'Appeal' includes any motion for a new trial and any proceeding in the nature
of an appeal."
<P>

70	I observe that the expression "any proceeding in the nature of an appeal"
may extend the normal notion of an appeal to encompass
what in some respects
bears some of the elements of an appeal. In that regard I note what Rolfe J in
<i>Full Brick Homes Pty Limited v Consumer Claims Tribunal &amp; Ors</i>
(NSWSC, Rolfe J, 13 February 1997, unreported) regarded as being an "appeal" in
the circumstances of that case. That case involved
relief being sought against,
inter alia, the Consumer Claims Tribunal whereby a declaration was sought that
the order it had made
was void for want of natural justice. It will be seen
that the present proceedings are in that respect not dissimilar. Rolfe J did
not however give any reasons for concluding that an "appeal" would encompass
such proceedings but it can be appreciated that such
a conclusion may
conceivably also be open here.
<P>

71	There is however a further difficulty, namely that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sfa1951176/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s6(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sfa1951176/" class="autolink_findacts">Suitors'
Fund Act</a></i> requires not only an appeal but also that the appeal be "against
the decision of a court". <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s2.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 2(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> defines "court" as including
"such tribunals or other bodies as are prescribed". So far as I am aware, there
has been no judicial
decision concluding that a taxing officer exercising a
taxation function culminating in certificates is thereby making "the decision
of a court" in that defined sense. That difficulty was not present before Rolfe
J. Miss Wentworth has in any event submitted that
the taxing officer is
exercising an administrative function, so that to treat the taxing officer as
having made "the decision of
a court" would not comport with those submissions.
That is another reason why the matter will need further argument if Miss
Wentworth
determines that she wishes to make a formal application in relation
to the <i>Suitors' Fund</i>.
<P>

<b>ORDERS</b>
<P>

72	Before finalising any orders in relation to the issues dealt with in this
judgment, I will give leave to any party to make any
further submissions
concerning the precise orders that should be made in conformity with this
judgment and to submit draft orders.
