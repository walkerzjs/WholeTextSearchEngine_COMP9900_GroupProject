<P>

<b>judgment (Application for Inspection of Defendant's Discovered
Documents)</b>
<P>

1   	By a Notice of Motion filed on 27 October 1999 the
plaintiff seeks an order that the defendant produce for inspection by the
plaintiff documents 15, 16 and 17 in Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the Affidavit of
Discovery sworn by Michael Lloyd-Jones on 17 July 1999.
<P>

2   	In support of the Notice of Motion an affidavit was sworn
by Nassir Bechara on 2 November 1999 annexing relevant formal documents.
<P>

3   	An order is sought under the "<i>old</i>" SCR Pt 23 r
10(1)(d).
<P>

4   	The documents fall into two categories.  The first category
is constituted by the diary kept by Mr Quail, an agent of the defendant,
up to
the date of the telecast of the second program in 1996.  Two sample pages of
that diary, for 8 February and 29 February 1996
have been tendered and marked
Exhibit A on the plaintiff's application.  The second category is made up of
three volumes of diaries
of Mr Quail after the publication complained of.
<P>

5   	As to the first category certain portions thereof had been
masked as "<i>irrelevant</i>".  
<P>

6   	As to the second category, of which I have no sample, a
claim for privilege is made in the following terms:
<P>

<i>"8(a)	the documents came into existence and were made after the proceedings
were commenced or contemplated for the sole purpose of
obtaining for and
furnishing to the Defendant's Solicitors evidence and information as to the
evidence which will be obtained and
otherwise for the use of the Solicitors to
enable them to conduct this action and otherwise to advise the Defendant,
or</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the documents are confidential communications passing between the
Defendant, its servants or agents and the Defendant's Solicitors
for the sole
purpose of obtaining legal advice".</i>
<P>

7   	It is accepted that the "<i>diaries</i>" are appointment
books.  They are "<i>relevant</i>" - they have been discovered (that is,
included in the list of documents) and contain material that is no more than
notations as
to appointments, the identity of the person being met and
telephone numbers and addresses.
<P>

8   	As to the <b>first category</b> of documents it is
contended for the plaintiff that their "<i>relevance</i>" being unquestioned by
reason of the fact that they have been listed in the affidavit, there is an
entitlement in the plaintiff to
inspect these documents. <i>"Irrelevance</i>"
is an insufficient basis for declining such an order.  For the defendant it is
contended, and it does not appear to be in dispute,
that the masked portions of
the diary bearing the notation "<i>irrelevant</i>" are private in nature and in
effect have absolutely nothing to do with these proceedings.  In this regard
particular attention was
paid to an entry in the diary for 29 February 1996 in
the following terms:  "<i>Call Deidre re Dinner". </i>  At first blush one
would think that this is the very type of "<i>private</i>" entry that would be
masked by a notation of "<i>irrelevant"</i>. Mr Nicholas Q.C. for the defendant
informed the Court, and it was not in issue, that the "<i>Deidre</i>" there
referred to is Deidre Grusovin who has some "<i>connection</i>" with the
subject matter of these proceedings.  The disclosure of this entry to my mind
reinforces the "<i>integrity</i>" of the Affidavit of Discovery.
<P>

9   	It is further argued in relation to the first category of
documents that the disclosed entries cannot be understood in the
absence of the
context in which they appear to be written.  In relation to the entry for 8
February there are a series of entries
"<i>Call Gareth Harvey"</i> followed by
"<i>Call</i> ..."<i> </i>several times appearing which is masked at its
beginning and end in circumstances where it can be inferred that entries of a
similar
kind have been masked.  To understand the basis of the claim for
"<i>relevance</i>" of the disclosed entries, it is argued, it is necessary to
see the entries masked to determine what criteria were applied in swearing
the
affidavit to the effect I have mentioned.
<P>

10   	The masking of material in discovered documents and a
notation of irrelevance is a rule of practice.  In <b><i>Telstra Corp v
Australis Media Holdings &amp; Ors </i></b>(unreported, 10 February 1997)
McClelland CJ in Eq at 2-3 said:
<P>

<i>"...a rule of practice which provides, in that sense, a gloss on express
requirements imposed by rules or by orders of the court.
There is, however, a
difference for the purposes of the application of this rule of practice between
cases of privilege, on the one
hand, and cases of irrelevance on the other. The
existence of a recognised privilege confers a positive right to withhold
production,
whereas exclusion of part of a document on the ground of
irrelevance is permitted as a matter of practice, in order to avoid
infringement,
for no legitimate purpose, of interests of privacy and
confidentiality, and thus to avoid injustice.</i>
<P>

<i>There is a serious risk that too assiduous a masking of documents on the
grounds of irrelevance will create gaps affecting the ready
comprehensibility
of the remaining portions of the document and of the context in which those
portions appear. If for this, or any
other, reason, masking on the ground of
alleged irrelevance would detract from a proper understanding of the meaning
and significance
of the admittedly relevant parts of the document, then such
masking is not justified".</i>
<P>

11   	His Honour had cited <b><i>G. E. Capital Corporate Finance
Group v Bankers Trust Co &amp; Ors</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%201%20WLR%20172" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] 1 WLR 172</a> in which, in my
view, the passages in the judgment of Hoffmann LJ at 175G and Leggatt LJ at
176H conform with the principles enunciated
by McClelland CJ in Eq.  
<P>

12   	I am not satisfied that the masking of the documents have
affected the "<i>ready comprehensibility</i>" of the exposed portions and
accept that those in fact masked have been done so in the interests of privacy
and confidentiality.
<P>

13   	Accordingly, no order that the defendant provide
inspection of the first category of documents will be made.
<P>

14   	As to the <b>second category</b> of documents
(post-publication diaries) the grounds for the privilege asserted are those
that I have extracted from the Affidavit
above.  No other evidence in support
of that claim has been tendered or sought.
<P>

15   	For the plaintiff, accepting the description of the
entries given in Court, it is contended that the documents insofar as
they are
made up of entries of the kind described are not "<i>confidential
communications"</i> or "<i>confidential documents</i>" within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p3.10" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3.10</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (NSW)</i>.
<P>

16   	A "<i>confidential communication</i>" is defined as a
"<i>communication made in such circumstances that, when it was made:  (a) the
person who made it; or (b) the person to whom it was made;
 was under an
express or implied obligation not to disclose its contents, whether or not the
obligation arises under law;"</i>
<P>

17   	A "<i>confidential document"</i> means a "<i>document
prepared in such circumstances that, when it was prepared:  (a) the person who
prepared it;  or (b) the person for whom it
was prepared;  was under an express
or implied obligation not to disclose its contents, whether or not the
obligation arises under
law;" </i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 117(1)).</a>
<P>

18   	What is here submitted is that the diary does not contain
any "<i>communication</i>" and nothing in any ordinary diary of Mr Quail (as
exemplified by Exhibit A) sets out the substance of any <i>"communication</i>"
which takes place and which would be a communication in respect of which a
claim for privilege could reasonably be made.  It is
argued that the fact that
Mr Quail has recorded the fact that he meets with a particular individual on a
particular day, or identifies
the address and telephone number of that person,
cannot be and is not a privileged "<i>communication</i>":  it is simply not a
communication at all.  A document that merely records the fact of his meeting
or a telephone call made or to
be made, or whatever else, is not a
"<i>confidential document</i>" within the definition in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act
1995</a> (NSW).  </i>A <i>"confidential document</i>" is one which records a
confidential communication and there is nothing here that constitutes any
element of communication at all.
 There is nothing explicit, or nothing from
which anything can be inferred, as to the circumstances which would bring about
the application
of the definition of communication or information.
<P>

19   	It is stated for the plaintiff that what is being sought
is to ascertain the "<i>pattern of inquiry</i>" that Mr Quail adopted, not the
results of those inquiries.  The diaries are of course "<i>relevant</i>"
because they have been included on the list of discovered documents.
<P>

20   	I add in relation to both categories of documents, insofar
as it would have been and is open to me to inspect the documents
themselves to
determine the issue, there is a reluctance on the part of the plaintiff that I
do so by reason of my lack of acquaintance
with all the matters in issue in
this litigation.  I am not in as good as a position as the plaintiff's camp to
determine the question
of relevance.  There is an equivalent reluctance in the
defendant on that basis and also on the basis, put in quite the appropriate
way, that I am the trial judge.  The latter, in view of the history of this
litigation, is a problem that really must be confronted
and in my view, is not
a serious one at all.
<P>

21   	For the defendant it is made clear that although the
post-publication diaries have been discovered there should be no disclosure
of
any of the contents of those documents based on two grounds:  first, relevance,
where the matter has been indicated as irrelevant
and second, that the entries
contain privileged information in a number of respects: for example, where a
telephone number or address
is recorded.  This is part and parcel, it is said,
of a communication which must necessarily have taken place in order to acquire
the very information as to the addresses and telephone numbers if that be the
information which is recorded in the document which
is the diary. 
<P>

22   	It is further said that the material alternatively would
constitute information that could properly be regarded as confidential.
 The
fact that address, identities, means of communication or contact at a
particular time have been recorded, it is said, is quite
plainly a matter of a
private kind.  These statements were made from the bar table by way of
submissions;  counsel cannot be criticised
in the circumstances for taking that
approach.  
<P>

23   	I have difficultly, at present, in placing the submissions
for the defendant in context.  I have not seen an example to which
the
submissions can sensibly relate in terms of an "<i>overall picture"</i>. 
<P>

24   	For example, it was submitted, that the whole of the
content of the diary in particular of which the claim for privilege made
is the
"<i>work product</i>" of the agent of the client for the purposes to which the
solicitor has sworn in his affidavit of discovery.  What precisely is meant
by
a "<i>work product</i>" I do not know:  no authority in that respect was cited
to me.  If it is a "<i>work product"</i> in the sense of being a document
produced reflecting the "<i>work" </i>done by Mr Quail consequent upon the
institution of proceedings and in preparation therefor, why are there private
and irrelevant
entries in it?
<P>

25   	I am presently of the view that the submissions for the
plaintiff are forceful;  the submissions for the defendant might obtain
significance upon my inspection of the diaries.  As this argument has been
structured I really see no alternative at this point than
to direct the
defendant to provide to me the relevant volumes for my inspection to determine
the substantive issues between the parties
in relation to them.
<P>

26   	Accordingly, the formal orders are:
<P>

1.	The application for an inspection order in respect of the pre-publication
Diary of Greg Quail is refused.
<P>

2.	The defendant is to produce to the Court for inspection by me the
post-publication Diaries of Greg Quail by 4.00pm on Thursday
18 November
1999.
<P>

3.	Costs are reserved.
