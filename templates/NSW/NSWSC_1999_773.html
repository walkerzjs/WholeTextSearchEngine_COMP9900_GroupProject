<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:   The applicant Christopher Roy Lee applies
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13A</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act 1989</a></i> for the re-determination of
a life sentence imposed upon him by McInerney J on 16 February 1990.  That life
sentence commenced on
19 October 1988.
<P>

2   	The factual circumstances found by the sentencing Judge
are:
<P>

<i>"The Crown case was that on the day in question the prisoner had been
drinking beer with his brother.  At the time he was unemployed
and was living
in a defacto relationship with the young lady and there were twin boys of that
relationship.  It appears after consuming
some alcohol - the precise quantity
is unclear - he left his parent's home where he had been drinking with his
brother, at Croydon
Park, and was walking to his place of residence at Lakemba.
It was on this journey that he came to the residence where the unfortunate
deceased and a young child were living with her parents.  These premises
consisted of premises above and behind a shop area.  The
living area was
apparently downstairs and there were two bedrooms, one occupied by the parents
of the deceased and the other by the
deceased and her child.  In her parents'
bedroom apparently there was a TV set and video recorder, and some
furniture.</i>
<P>

<i>What happened thereafter is unclear and one is dependent to a major extent
on what was seen by her parents and the investigating police
and to some extent
the prisoner's version of the events.  Her parents returned from work at
approximately 5.30 to 5.45pm.  When they
arrive home, they could hear the
deceased's baby crying.  They looked in the kitchen and a horrifying sight met
their eyes.  Their
daughter was lying face down on the floor, naked, in a pool
of blood, obviously dead from multiple stab wounds.  It was obvious that
she
had been the subject of a frenzied attack and the blade of a large carving
knife, responsible for her wounds, had broken off
and was still stuck in the
deceased's back.  Dr Bradhurst, the pathologist, who conducted the post-mortem
examination, and who viewed
the deceased's body at the premises stated in
evidence that he found twenty-three stab wounds to the body including wounds to
the
front of the chest, the back of the chest on the left, the left upper limb,
the right upper limb and the left lower limb.  The se
stab wounds were
penetrating wounds to the aorta, both lungs, the superior vena carva, the
diaphragm, the spleen, the liver and the
left internal jugular vein.  In the
police antecedent form the police described this killing as one of utmost
savagery and brutality
and with those comments I can only agree.</i>
<P>

<i>A person closely resembling the prisoner was seen outside the premises at
the relevant time and later was observed by another witness
walking up
Punchbowl Road in the direction of Lakemba, bare-chested, with a garment under
his arm involving the prisoner being on
the premises at the time the deceased
was killed.  The prisoner then returned to his home and being bare-chested, he
stated he had
been attacked by two men outside the Belfield Hotel and that his
shirt was lost in that incident.  He was persuaded by his neighbours
to report
this matter to the police and as a result, without going into the details, he
was arrested and charged with this offence.
 The deceased's mother testified
that the deceased had been acquainted with the prisoner and that the deceased
regarded him, like
a brother.</i>
<P>

<i>The prisoner in a record of interview to the police stated that he and the
deceased went upstairs.  After a period he and the deceased
began a sexual
encounter, if I can use that expression.  He said that whilst he was attempting
to have sexual relations with the
deceased, she suddenly pushed him away and
thereupon informed him that she proposed to ring the police and complain that
he had raped
her.  She then went downstairs where the telephone was situated
and he followed and tried to reason with her, without success, she
maintaining
that she was going to ring the police.  He then said he panicked and stabbed
her.  He also agreed that, not only did
he stab her in the chest, but when she
fell down, he stabbed her in the back.  He at no time disputed that the
questions and answers
in the record of interview were a correct transcript of
what took place between himself and police.  At the trial however a different
version of events occurred.</i>
<P>

<i>A Mr Ballinger gave evidence for the Crown.  This witness apparently had had
a previous de facto relationship with the deceased, and
was the father of her
child.  He was cross-examined at some length by Mr Green, of senior counsel,
suggesting in fact that he was
the person who had committed the murder, in the
presence of the prisoner.  The prisoner then alleged that he was threatened by
this
witness, that if he told anyone about what had happened, he would kill his
fiancee' and her two sons.  It was because of this threat,
he said, that he
decided to admit to the killing because he was not prepared to take the risk
that Ballinger may be lying.</i>
<P>

<i>Quite clearly, the jury rejected this version of events.  It is my view that
the jury would have accepted, as I do, that he attempted
to rape the deceased
in the upstairs bedroom.  This is supported, I believe, very strongly by the
torn state of her clothing found
on the floor of the upstairs bedroom, the
disturbed state of the double bed and blood on the cover and the pillow,
consistent with
that of the deceased.  It appears, in my view, that somehow or
other she was able to get away from the prisoner and escape downstairs
and
attempted to ring the police when she was stabbed by the prisoner.  This is the
only rational explanation, in my view, as to
her being found naked, stabbed to
death on the floor of the kitchen.  The jury obviously, in my view, would not
have accepted his
story of losing his shirt in the assault outside the hotel.
I believe that this was a story thought up by him to explain his bare-chested
appearance when he arrived home and I believe that at some stage on the journey
from the scene of the crime to his home, he disposed
of that shirt because it
was probably blood-stained".</i>
<P>

3   	The crime was rightly described on the objective facts as a
horrifying one and one which called for a very heavy penalty and
still can be
so described.
<P>

4   	In the circumstances referred to by the sentencing Judge
the deceased was stabbed 23 times.
<P>

5   	The formal material before me in this application is
constituted by Exhibit A made up of the Statement of Facts, the psychological
report of Mr John Taylor prepared on 8 February 1990, and His Honour Remarks on
Sentence.
<P>

6   	Exhibit B is the report of the Serious Offenders Review
Council prepared on 16 October 1997, and Exhibit C is supplementary
documentation from the Serious Offenders Review Council (Management Committee).
Exhibit 1 is a report, prepared on his own initiative,
as I understand it, by
Dr Roger Blake, psychologist, and Exhibit 2 the Notice of Reply to the
Statement of Facts and the document
appended thereto.
<P>

7   	The applicant gave no evidence before me.  Mr Craigie of
counsel could only inform the Court that the applicant was unwell
and really
did not wish to give evidence.  In all the circumstances I am not constrained
to draw any of the usual, or any particular
adverse inference from that fact;
it is but a neutral one.   
<P>

8   	No Victim Impact Statements were tendered.  Notwithstanding
that, it must be remarked that the horrendous killing, on the basis
of ordinary
human considerations, would have impacted awfully on those close to the
deceased, Leanne Gai Collins.
<P>

9   	With His Honour's observations on the gravity of the
objective circumstances of the murder I am in entire agreement.  Whilst
alcohol
was not found by His Honour to have played any mitigating role at the time,
still it can now only stand, to the extent that
there was any involvement, as
some explanation but not as an excuse.
<P>

10   	The applicant has maintained his innocence and thereby has
displayed in the strict sense no contrition for the horrific murder
of which he
was found guilty.  However it does appear  to me on the material to which I
have referred that it can be said of this
applicant that he has reached a point
of acceptance of the situation in which he finds himself.   This however is not
the same as
contrition or remorse.  Importantly, the continued assertion of
innocence is not necessarily inconsistent with the prospects of rehabilitation
(see<b> <i>Regina v Raymond Leslie White</i> </b>(CCA, unreported, 23 June
1998, Spigelman CJ at page 5).  That proposition is to some extent affirmed in
<b><i>Regina v Stephens</i></b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/80.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWCCA 80</a>, (22 April 1999) per Sheller
JA at 17-18.  That case however on its face is starkly different from the
present.  In no way can it
be said in this case that the conduct leading to the
death of the deceased was premeditated.
<P>

11   	Thus, as to the objective circumstances of the offence the
conclusions reached by the sentencing Judge are ones with which
I would agree
and which I would characterise as identifying an horrendous act of violence
arising from circumstances that in some
way caused this applicant to
"<i>snap</i>" (cf.  <b><i>Regina v Brett Leroy Ellison,</i></b> 13 March 1988
unreported, a decision of my own), and were circumstances which called for,
according to the law as it then stood as
His Honour found, the imposition of
the life sentence in the absence of mitigating factors.
<P>

12   	In accordance with the law applicable to a
re-determination, it was objectively a horrendous crime, as I have said, which
calls for a severe penalty reflecting principles of punishment, retribution,
and general deterrence.  Personal deterrence in the
curious position of a
person who asserts innocence nonetheless can perform some role in relation to
an applicant who at least has
reached a point of the acceptance.
<P>

13   	Since his imprisonment the applicant, now aged 34, (he has
spent 10 years 9 months and 5 days in custody), the evidence in
the form of the
usual certificates indicates, has embarked upon alcohol and drug related
rehabilitation courses and gained some appropriate
insights.  Overall he has
worked and has performed jobs within the prison system and is presently doing
so.  There is no basis for
any adverse conclusions to be reached against the
applicant in terms of any disciplinary problems within the prison system.
<P>

14   	There has however been an unusual administrative conflict
between the applicant and the authorities in relation to classification.
 The
basis of that conflict was that the applicant enter into a Tier Three programme
for sexual offenders.  This the applicant has
been unwilling to do and, to my
mind, not without some justification in the sense he is not a convicted sexual
offender.  He stood
trial on the charge of murder only.  That there was sexual
activity before the crime was committed was found by the learned sentencing
Judge.  In the end I am not persuaded that conflict between the applicant and
the relevant authorities should operate to his detriment.
<P>

15   	The applicant of course has undergone periods of
protection  and movement within the prison system unquestionably to his
dissatisfaction
particularly in relation to contact with his family, there
having been none over the last three years or so, as I understand, otherwise
than by telephone.  He is presently in custody at Junee.
<P>

16   	As I have said he maintains his innocence but that does
not derogate from the significance of the steps being taken to rehabilitate
himself in terms of his alcohol abuse and otherwise properly to conduct himself
within the prison system.  
<P>

17   	It was submitted by Mr Craigie of counsel for the
applicant that the applicant has become reclusive, has kept to himself,
and
indeed part of his personality has, as-it-were, "<i>closed down" </i>which
could point to an early onset of what is known as institutionalisation.   The
public interest should be served and conformably
with all the relevant
considerations of principle that can now apply to the re-determination of a
sentence in a way, that state of
institutionalisation not be permitted to
mature.
<P>

18   	There is no suggestion in the material of future
dangerousness.  In his report of 7 July this year Dr Blake remarks:
<P>

<i>"Despite the inherent difficulty in regard to admission and acceptance of
guilt, Mr Lee is a person who disclosed potential in regard
to personality
improvement."</i>
<P>

19   	The applicant has and will have the benefit of the
professional care and interest that Dr Blake is prepared to provide him.
<P>

20   	The applicant is aware he will have to spend some
considerable further time in custody.  He thus has no plans presently in
relation to his release, but Mr Craigie has informed the Court that in due
course he hopes to go to an environment where arrangements
for employment at
least will have been made.
<P>

21   	The applicant, who is not an inherently evil person, whose
criminal antecedents are irrelevant, is industrious now and at
least can be
said to feel a "<i>sense of responsibility</i>".  Insofar as there is evidence
of general progress to rehabilitation, it is to be acknowledged that by reason
of his withdrawal,
and notwithstanding his self-imposed isolation, he has
contact with the outside world through the family of a fellow inmate who has
befriended him.
<P>

22   	For the purposes of the imposition of the sentence on this
application for re-determination, the objective gravity of the
offence for
which the applicant was convicted on a plea of not guilty and in respect of
which he maintains his innocence, cannot
be disproportionately or unreasonably
diminished in the light of factors which have occurred since the imposition of
the life sentence.
<P>

23   	The Crown does not oppose the application.  
<P>

24   	The Crown stresses the seriousness of the objective facts
and submits the findings of the sentencing Judge as to the alcohol
and the
absence of contrition to the extent that innocence is maintained in the face of
a finding of guilt on a plea of not guilty
cannot be overlooked.  I agree.
<P>

25   	Otherwise, as I perceive the situation, the position of
the Crown and the applicant in relation to rehabilitation and future
dangerousness is virtually as one.  The objective seriousness of the murder
calls for a substantial prison term  during the balance
of which the applicant
should pursue his steps to rehabilitation and adjustment and avail himself of
such services as exemplified
by Dr Blake.
<P>

26   	Having weighed the factors to which I have referred I am
of the view the appropriate minimum term is 16 years and the additional
term
should be 5 years.
<P>

27   	Christopher Roy Lee pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 13A</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing
Act 1989</a></i> having granted your application for a re-determination of the life
sentence imposed on 16 February 1990, I sentence you in respect
of the charge
of murder of which you were found guilty to a total term of penal servitude of
21 years to date from 19 October 1988.
 I fix a minimum term of 16 years to
date from 19 October 1988 and to expire on 18 October 2004.  I fix an
additional term of 5 years
to commence on 19 October 2004 and to expire on 18
October 2009.
<P>

28   	You will be eligible for release to parole on 18 October
2004.
<P>

29   	Exhibits may be returned.
