<b><u>111752/99 ROBYN ANNE RICHARDSON v GLENN ANTHONY PEDLER - THE ESTATE OF
ROGER KEVIN PEDLER</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b> The defendant, Mr Pedler, by Notice of
Motion filed on 23 August 1999 seeks an order that the statement of claim filed
by Robyn Anne
Richardson be dismissed or, alternatively, that it be struck out.
There are some additional orders sought which I need not deal with
at the
present time.
<P>

2   	The application is made under the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13</a>
rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules, it being claimed either that the proceedings
are frivolous or vexatious, or that the proceedings
are an abuse of process of
the Court.  What is in essence alleged is that the action is doomed to fail.
<P>

3   	It is not necessary to deal with the claim under Part 15
rule 26 of the rules, that being more a pleadings matter.  If the
applicant
succeeds, then, in my view, he must succeed under Pt 13 r5.
<P>

4   	In the action under challenge the plaintiff, Ms Richardson,
claims she was a defacto wife of the late Roger Kevin Pedler who
died on 25
August 1994. As I understand it, it is not contested that she was such a
wife.
<P>

5   	It is claimed that the deceased left a Will dated 5
December 1993 which he signed but did not have witnessed; that on 10 July
1996
as a result of a Deed of Arrangement between the plaintiff and the defendant
Letters of Administration of the Estate were granted
to the plaintiff; that the
defendant then took proceedings in matter number 1860 of 1997 in the Equity
Division of this Court seeking
to have the Deed of Arrangement set aside and
the grant of Letters of Administration revoked; that by orders made on 20
November
1997 in those proceedings Young J revoked the grant of Letters of
Administration, declared that a document which I will call a reconstructed
Will
was validly executed by the deceased and had not been revoked at his death, and
ordered that Letters of Administration with
that reconstructed will annexed be
granted to Mr Pedler.
<P>

6   	That Will in respect of which a grant was sought and made
in those proceedings, although not identified by date in the orders
or not
dated, which may have been an error, apparently was alleged to have been made
in 1991, as reference to the judgment of His
Honour at page 21 will make
clear.
<P>

7   	Ms Richardson seeks to have that grant revoked and seeks an
order that Probate of a document dated 5 December 1993 be granted
to her, that
document being one signed by the deceased but not witnessed which, if it were a
document which ought to be admitted
to Probate, gave the whole of the Estate of
the deceased to Robyn Anne Richardson apart from a home unit at Ashfield which
was left
to the deceased's second son, the present defendant, and subject to
certain provisions which were made as to the deceased's pets
and for his friend
Colin Crockett.  This document purported to appoint Mr Hickey, solicitor, as
executor.  Mr Hickey has renounced
any right to apply for Probate of that
document.
<P>

8   	If the claim of the plaintiff in these proceedings is to
succeed, then it could only succeed, as I understand it, if an order
were made
under s18A of the <u>Wills <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Act 1898</a></u> in the event
that the Court was satisfied that the document, although not formally executed
in accordance with that Act, was a document
which the deceased intended to
constitute his Will either at the time of execution or at some later identified
time.  I only add
that because to that extent it may be that if the claim were
allowed to remain on foot it would have to be repleaded to make that
issue
plain.
<P>

9   	The defendant seeks to have the proceedings dismissed
because they are doomed to fail either because a defence of one of res
judicata, issue estoppel or what might be described as an Anshun estoppel being
an extension of the res judicata principle, must
succeed.
<P>

10   	In the proceedings before Young J for a grant of
representation of the Will which His Honour found Ms Richardson had destroyed,
there was reference made to what was described in His Honour's judgment as "a
draft will signed by the deceased on 5 December 1993
but not witnessed".  It is
that document which the plaintiff seeks now to have admitted to Probate. His
Honour said:
<P>

Mr Sheppard an estate agent in the Hunters Hill district, has deposed that the
deceased brought this signed form to his office with
a request for it to be
witnessed.  Mr Sheppard returned it with a message that the document would have
to be re-executed in the presence
of himself and another witness but the
deceased did not return.
<P>

11   	On page 21 of the Judgment the following paragraph
appears:
<P>

The other evidence suggests that the deceased was trying different drafts of a
replacement Will between 1993 and his death but he
never got around to
executing them. The preponderance of the evidence suggests that it was this
1991 Will that the defendant destroyed.
<P>

12   	In the summons in proceedings 1860 of 1997 Mr Glen Pedler,
the defendant in the present proceedings, sought the following
orders:
<P>

1.	That the grant of Letters of Administration of 10 June 1996 be revoked.
<P>

2.	A declaration that the deceased wrote and executed a Will, the substance of
which was as found by His Honour and of which a grant
was made.
<P>

3.	A declaration that at the date of death of the deceased that Will had not
been revoked.
<P>

4.	An order that Letters of Administration with that Will or that Will as
reconstructed annexed be made to him.
<P>

13   	His Honour found in favour of Mr Pedler and made
orders:
<P>

1.	Revoking the grant of Letters of Administration.
<P>

2.	Declaring a document in the form annexed to the orders to have been duly
executed as a Will and not to have been revoked by the
deceased.
<P>

3.	That subject to compliance with the rules of the Court Letters of
Administration with the reconstructed will annexed be granted
to Mr Pedler.
<P>

14   	A grant has been made accordingly.
<P>

15   	The present plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal appealing
against the decision of His Honour. Ground 4 of the grounds of appeal
was:
<P>

His Honour erred in fact and in law by not finding that a Will signed by the
deceased, the late Roger Pedler, dated 5 December 1993
was the last Will and
Testament of the said Roger Kevin Pedler.
<P>

Ground 7.  
<P>

His Honour erred in fact and law in holding that the Will dated 5 December 1993
did not revoke any previous wills made by the deceased.
<P>

16   	In Probate proceedings where there is a claim whether by
summons or by statement of claim for a grant of letters of administration
of an
Estate, or a claim for a grant of Probate or Letters of Administration with the
Will annexed, if the defendant wishes to assert
that Probate or administration
ought not to be granted because the will propounded was not the last Will of
the deceased, or because
in the case of a claim for administration the deceased
left a will, then that is a matter to be raised by way of defence and if
possible,
in appropriate cases by way of cross-claim if the defendant is a
person entitled to a grant in respect of a later testamentary instrument.
<P>

17   	In the present case, the document which Ms Richardson now
seeks to have admitted to Probate was a document under which she
was appointed
to be principal beneficiary.  She would therefore be the person who had the
prior entitlement to a grant of Letters
of Administration with the Will annexed
in the event of revocation of any right to Probate by the executor named in
that document.
<P>

18   	An issue must always arise in contested Probate
proceedings as to whether or not the document propounded for Probate or Letters
of Administration with the Will annexed is the last Will of the deceased, and
although it is perhaps unfortunate that the earlier
proceedings did not proceed
by way of pleading, there can be no doubt from the orders sought in the summons
that this was an issue
between the parties. That I think is made more clear by
the judgment of His Honour which clearly addresses the question of this later
document by the orders he made, and by the grounds of appeal.
<P>

19   	This, of course, is not a final determination.  What must
be determined in an application such as this is whether or not the
claim of the
plaintiff is doomed to fail accepting as I do that the estoppel defences would
be raised.  I have said on another occasion
in <b><cite>Maronis Holdings
Limited &amp; Anor v Nippon Credit Australia Ltd</cite></b> (unreported 6
October 1994) following a suggestion in <b><cite>Effem Foods Pty Limited v
Trawl Industries of Australia Pty Ltd </cite></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1993/342.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] FCA 342</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20115%20ALR%20377" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 115 ALR 377</a> at 387 that
the preferable course in matters like this is for the defendant to plead to the
statement of claim and then for the court
to order the defences based on
estoppel be tried first and separately.  However, in
<b><cite>Maronis</cite></b> I did make an order for dismissal under Pt13 r5,
which was upheld by the Court of Appeal, so that is clearly in order in proper
cases.
 I have come to the conclusion that the issue the plaintiff seeks to
litigate in this action is one which has been determined between
the plaintiff
and defendant by the judgment of Young J.  Mr Mee Ling, solicitor for the
plaintiff, has argued that the earlier proceedings
were between the same
parties but in different capacities.  I do not accept that to be the position.
The parties in the earlier proceedings
were either claiming revocation of a
grant and a new grant of representation of the Estate of the deceased, or
seeking to retain
the grant which had previously been made. They were in
precisely the same interest in those proceedings as they are in the present
proceedings, at least insofar as those claims were made.
<P>

20   	If I were wrong in my finding that the proceedings ought
to be struck out on the basis that the defendant is vexed by having
to defend
an action which has been already decided, in other words is subject to cause of
action estoppel, in my view a defence based
on extended estoppel within the
principles of <b><cite>Henderson v Henderson</cite></b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1843/917.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1843] EngR 917</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281843%29%203%20Hare%20100" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1843) 3 Hare 100</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=67%20ER%20313" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">67
ER 313</a> as expounded in <b><cite>Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty
Ltd</cite></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20147%20CLR%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 147 CLR 589</a> would succeed. The plaintiff was clearly
aware of the later document now sought to be propounded during the earlier
proceedings by
way of cross-claim. Any claim that the plaintiff's claim in
those proceedings could be defeated through some later document entitled
to be
admitted to Probate was a claim which ought properly to have been made in those
proceedings.  While it is necessary when dealing
with what is conveniently
called <b><cite>Anshun</cite></b> estoppel to consider whether or not it was
reasonable for a party not to put forward a claim then available to it, in my
view it
could not be said in these proceedings that it  was in any way
reasonable for Ms Richardson not to put forward that claim.  As I
have said it
appears to have been accepted that she did so in the grounds of appeal, but if
she did not then clearly she ought to
have done so, because a successful claim
in the nature of the one which she now wishes to bring would have meant the
failure of the
claim which Mr Pedler made in those proceedings.
<P>

21   	Thus, while the plaintiff in these proceedings was not
able to plead that matter by way of defence in summons proceedings,
she was
required to bring it up by way of the cross-claim.  For that reason also I am
of the view that a defence based on extended
estoppel would succeed; in
traditional terms, the defendant being vexed by having to meet a claim which
ought to have been made at
an earlier stage.  It follows the present claim
should be dismissed pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13</a> rule 5.  I propose to make that
order.
<P>

22   	A claim has been made by the defendant for indemnity costs
on the basis that there has been continuing litigation between
the parties and
that as this action was doomed to fail it has all the hallmarks of being an
abuse of process and that the Court ought
to visit such an abuse with an order
for indemnity costs.
<P>

23   	I am not certain that is the position at least in respect
of many matters which are dealt with under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/index.html#p13" class="autolink_findacts">Part 13</a> Rule 5 which is a convenient
method of dealing with claims at an early stage when it is clear that they
ought not to be allowed to
continue, that being the view that I take of the
present case.  This matter is perhaps close to the borderline, the crossing of
which
would justify an order for indemnity costs being granted in view of the
earlier litigation between the parties.  However, I do not
consider that it is
such an abuse that such an order ought to be made.
