<b>MASTER McLAUGHLIN</b>
<P>

<i>Wednesday, 13 October 1999</i>
<P>

<b>3273/97	SHIAUW WEI GRAHAM   -v-   MICHAEL GERD HUGO WIEGAND</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:   </b>These are proceedings under the <i>De
Facto Relationships Act</i> 1984 (which is now known as the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pa1984298/" class="autolink_findacts">Property
(Relationships) Act </i>1984</a>).
<P>

2   	On 25 February 1999 Mr Justice Windeyer made an order
committing to a Master the determination of all issues in the proceedings.
However, in the light of the nature of the relief which was ultimately sought
by each of the parties, it is probably unnecessary
for the enhancement of my
powers by that order to be invoked for the purpose of determining these
proceedings.
<P>

3   	By statement of claim filed on 18 July 1997 the plaintiff
Shiauw Wie Graham claims relief adjusting the interests of herself
and the
defendant Michael Gerd Hugo Wiegand in property, pursuant to section 20 of the
<i>De Facto Relationships Act</i>. In the alternative to declaratory relief
(and consequential relief) concerning a residential property situate at and
known as 19/34
Stanton Road, Balmoral ("the Balmoral property"), the plaintiff
by prayer 4 of the statement of claim seeks an order that the defendant
pay to
the plaintiff the sum of $200,000. At the commencement of the hearing the
plaintiff through her Counsel informed the Court,
and it is was noted, that the
only relief now being sought by her was that claimed in prayer 4 of the
statement of claim, the amount
of $200,000 claimed therein being amended to
$100,000. That amendment was not opposed by the defendant.
<P>

4   	Accordingly, the hearing of the matter proceeded upon the
basis that the claim of the plaintiff was not for an interest in
the Balmoral
property, but was for an order that the defendant should pay to the plaintiff
the sum of $100,000. 
<P>

5   	The defendant filed a defence and cross-claim and,
subsequently (on 6 April 1999), an amended defence and cross-claim. By that
cross-claim the defendant seeks an order that the plaintiff transfer to the
defendant all her right, title and interest in shares
held by her in Havenpearl
Pty Limited and in Dewcode Pty Limited. The plaintiff does not oppose such an
order being made. 
<P>

6   	The plaintiff and the defendant were in a de facto
relationship from 8 January 1989 until 30 October 1996 (a duration of about
seven years and ten months). Throughout a substantial period of their
relationship both parties were resident within New South Wales,
although at
various times during the relationship the parties travelled interstate and
overseas on holidays and on business; and,
as will emerge later in this
judgment, the defendant was overseas for periods of some months each year
during a number of years of
the relationship. It was not, however, disputed by
either party that the relationship obtained without interruption from its
inception
on 8 January 1989 until its termination on 30 October 1996. 
<P>

7   	The plaintiff was born on 6 January 1954 at Bandung in
Indonesia (and she is presently 45 years of age); the defendant was
born on 1
June 1947 at Wiesbaden in Germany (and he is presently 52 years of age). The
plaintiff has been resident in Australia since
January 1973, and she is an
Australian citizen. Her present occupation is stated to be that of a financial
controller. The plaintiff,
before the commencement of the de facto relationship
with the defendant, had been married. She was subsequently divorced in 1986.
The plaintiff had two children of that marriage (a daughter now aged 20, and a
son now aged 15), who presently are, and throughout
most of the period of the
plaintiff's relationship with the defendant were, resident with their father.
No children were born to
the relationship of the plaintiff and the defendant.

<P>

8   	The defendant qualified as a specialist obstetrician and
gynaecologist in Germany before coming to Australia in November 1987.
Subsequently he obtained permanent residence in Australia. However, for a
number of years the defendant's medical qualifications
were not recognised in
Australia. It was in consequence of that fact that, until the defendant in
about March 1994 obtained specialist
qualifications in Australia (being
membership of the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists)
that it was the
practice of the defendant to spend a substantial period of each
year in Germany (or, on one occasion, in the United Arab Emirates),
where he
conducted his medical profession, in employment as a <i>locum tenens</i>. After
he obtained the appropriate Australian qualifications the defendant then
continued to practice his profession in Australia,
mainly in New South Wales.

<P>

9   	At the time of the commencement of the de facto
relationship the plaintiff had the following assets (to which the following
estimated values were by her ascribed):
<P>

Home unit situate at and known as 4/20 New South Head Road, Darling Point ("the
Darling Point property") - $100,000. 
<P>

Savings - $2,000.
<P>

Household goods and furniture - $5,000. 
<P>

Volvo 244GL motor vehicle - $10,000.
<P>

Clothing and personal effects - $2,000.
<P>

10   	(The ownership and ascribed values of the last two items
were expressly admitted by the defence.) 
<P>

11   	The plaintiff had purchased the Darling Point property in
December 1984 for $51,250. At the commencement of the relationship
the only
liability of the plaintiff was her indebtedness under a mortgage secured over
the Darling Point property, the amount outstanding
under that mortgage being
$40,000. 
<P>

12   	At the time of the commencement of the relationship the
plaintiff was employed as accounts manager for an entity known as
Megavision
International, at an income of between about $40,000 and $48,000 a year. She
retained that position until about early
1995 when she commenced employment as
director of finance with Jackson Wells Communication, at an income of about
$68,000 a year.
She is still employed in that position.
<P>

13   	At the commencement of the relationship the defendant had
the following property (to which the following estimated values
were
ascribed):
<P>

Mercedes-Benz 170E motor vehicle - $62,000.
<P>

Ford motor vehicle - $3,000.
<P>

Holden motor vehicle - $1,500.
<P>

Savings (in a bank account in the name of one Manfred Schauer) - $24,000.
<P>

Savings in Germany - $10,000.
<P>

ANZ Bank Account, Rose Bay - $20,000.
<P>

Clothing and personal effects - $2,000.
<P>

14   	(The ownership and ascribed values of the three motor
vehicles and of the last item were expressly admitted by the defence;
the
amount of the penultimate item and of the savings in the account held by Mr
Schauer and the existence, but not the amount, of
the savings in Germany were
admitted by the defendant in his affidavit evidence.) 
<P>

15   	The savings of the defendant in Germany, in an amount of
about $10,000 at the commencement of the relationship, would appear
to
represent a superannuation entitlement of the defendant.
<P>

16   	The Mercedes motor vehicle had been brought by the
defendant to Australia from Germany (where he had purchased it with the
proceeds of sale of a yacht which he owned in Germany). At the time of the
commencement of the relationship the defendant was residing
in rented
accommodation, being an apartment at 6/19 Eastbourne Road, Darling Point (for
which the defendant was paying about $185
a week by way of rent; that rent was
automatically deducted from the defendant's account with the ANZ Bank at Rose
Bay). 
<P>

17   	At the commencement of the relationship the plaintiff
moved into residence with the defendant in the Eastbourne Road apartment.
However, she did not at that stage dispose of or lease out her home unit at
Darling Point. 
<P>

18   	In December 1990 the plaintiff consolidated her
liabilities in the form of a single mortgage, in an amount of $86,000, over
the
Darling Point property. 
<P>

19   	It has already been recorded that until about March 1994
the defendant was not able to practice his medical specialty in Australia,
but
that he engaged in professional employment in the field of that specialty in
the capacity as a locum, essentially in Germany,
but also, at least on one
occasion in the United Arab Emirates. The defendant had also been employed for
a period of about six months
in 1988 - 1989 in the Northern Territory (where,
apparently, he was legally entitled to practice his profession) not long before
the commencement of the relationship with the plaintiff. In early 1994 the
defendant was employed as a Registrar at the Royal North
Shore Hospital for a
period of about one month. 
<P>

20   	Throughout the period of the relationship, whilst the
defendant was resident in New South Wales, he was (apart from the foregoing
period of about one month whilst he was employed at the Royal North Shore
Hospital) not in employment until about March 1994, when
he obtained his
Australian specialist qualifications. Whilst resident in New South Wales the
defendant was studying for the purpose
of obtaining those specialist
qualifications. The plaintiff was throughout the entirety of the relationship
in full-time employment.
The defendant described his status as being that of a
"house husband". For a period of about six months in 1989 - 1990 the defendant
was, quite lawfully, in receipt of Australian unemployment benefits. 
<P>

21   	The defendant was not able to give any reliable estimate
of what his earnings were in New South Wales after he obtained his
Australian
specialist medical qualifications. 
<P>

22   	During each period whilst the defendant was working
overseas it was the practice of the plaintiff to join him for a holiday
(frequently in Germany, but also in other countries in Europe, Asia and North
and South America). On those occasions the defendant
paid the air fares of the
plaintiff, and the parties shared their other travel expenses, being
accommodation, food and the like.
It was also the usual practice of the
defendant on each such holiday to give to the plaintiff a present (often a
piece of jewellery).
<P>

23   	In about May 1991 the defendant purchased in his sole name
a residential unit situate at and known as 18/2-6 Clarke Street,
Vaucluse ("the
Vaucluse property") for $215,000. According to the defendant that property was
purchased with moneys (in a total amount
of about $250,000) advanced by his
mother, which amount he is liable to repay to his mother. The balance of those
moneys (about $35,000)
was deposited in Mr Schauer's account with the
Commonwealth Bank at Alice Springs. The Vaucluse property was sold in June 1995
for
$305,000. 
<P>

24   	From the time of its acquisition until May 1995 the
parties resided in the Vaucluse property. In that latter month they moved
into
rented premises at Cremorne, where they remained until the termination of the
relationship on 30 October 1996. Upon that termination
the defendant remained
in residence in the Cremorne unit, whilst the plaintiff moved into other
accommodation. 
<P>

25   	In December 1989 and January 1990 the defendant acquired
respectively Dewcode Pty Limited ("Dewcode") and Havenpearl Pty Limited
("Havenpearl"), of which companies the defendant and the plaintiff were the
sole shareholders and sole directors and the plaintiff
was the secretary. The
plaintiff did not make any payment for her shareholding in either of those
companies. After the acquisition
of those companies the defendant conducted his
professional medical activities through the vehicle of those companies. 
<P>

26   	After the termination of the relationship the defendant
paid to the plaintiff the sum of $10,000, (that payment being made
through the
vehicle of Dewcode) for her to continue to attend to the books of Dewcode
throughout 1997. However, the plaintiff continued
only until May 1997 to
perform financial and accounting work for Dewcode. The plaintiff resigned as a
director and as a secretary
of Dewcode in May 1997. Dewcode (at the instigation
of the defendant) thereupon sued the plaintiff in the Local Court for the
balance
of that pre-payment. After an arbitration there was an award in favour
of Dewcode against the plaintiff in the sum of $8,081.5. The
plaintiff
unsuccessfully applied to pay that judgment debt by instalments, and
subsequently paid to Dewcode the amount of that judgment
debt.
<P>

27   	In May 1997 (that is, more than six months after the
termination of the relationship) the defendant purchased, for $405,000,
a home
unit situate at and known as 19/34 Stanton Road, Balmoral, in which home unit
he presently resides. (That is the property
in respect of which, until the
commencement of the hearing, the plaintiff claimed an interest.)
<P>

28   	The plaintiff disposed of her Darling Point property on 13
January 1993. She did not personally receive any financial benefit
from that
sale, since the entirety of the proceeds of sale (the sale price being
$110,000) was disbursed in discharging the mortgage
of $86,000 upon that
property and in paying other debts of the plaintiff. 
<P>

29   	The defendant said that at the time of the sale of the
Darling Point unit he lent to the plaintiff $18,000 to assist her in
paying
various debts which she still owed. That loan was denied by the plaintiff.
According to the defendant part of that sum of
$18,000 was repaid by the
plaintiff over a period of time, and part of that loan was forgiven her by the
defendant, according to
whom an amount of $1,500 of that debt still remains
unpaid. Further reference to this alleged loan will be made later in this
judgment.
<P>

30   	At the conclusion of the relationship on 30 October 1996
the assets of the parties consisted of:
<P>

Shareholding in Dewcode Pty Limited (1 share held by each of the plaintiff and
the defendant).
<P>

Shareholding in Havenpearl Pty Limited (1 share held by each of the plaintiff
and the defendant).
<P>

BMW motor vehicle, registered in the name of the plaintiff (having an
undisputed estimated value of $34,000). 
<P>

Compass sailing boat, registered in the name of the defendant (to which the
plaintiff ascribes a value of $50,000, whilst the defendant
asserts a value of
$30,000).
<P>

Furniture and household effects.
<P>

Savings invested in the name of the plaintiff ($4,000).
<P>

31   	In addition, it was asserted by the plaintiff that at the
termination of the relationship the defendant had savings invested
in his name
totalling $400,000, and that those savings included the proceeds of sale of the
Vaucluse property. That assertion was
denied by the defendant.
<P>

32   	I have already referred to the acquisition in the name of
the defendant of the Vaucluse property. According to the defendant
that
purchase was funded by an advance of $215,000 from the defendant's mother, Mrs
Stefanie Karola Annelies Wiegand (who is presently
aged 88 and resides at
Wiesbaden in Germany). 
<P>

33   	A very considerable quantity of evidence (by way of
affidavit evidence, documentation and oral evidence, including an affidavit
sworn by Mrs Wiegand in Germany --- on account of her advanced years and the
fact that she is resident in Germany she was not cross-examined
on that
affidavit) was directed to the nature of the interest of the defendant in the
Vaucluse property and in the Balmoral property
(the purchase of which was
largely funded by the proceeds of sale of the Vaucluse property).
<P>

34   	At one stage a suggestion was made that the Balmoral
property was owned by the defendant's mother and was held on trust for
the
defendant. At another stage the suggestion was made that the defendant held
that home unit on trust for his mother. It was on
account of the possibility
that it might become necessary for the Court to make findings and
determinations and, subsequently, declarations,
concerning interests held on
trusts, that Mr Justice Windeyer on 25 February 1999 made the order to which I
have already referred.
<P>

35   	However, in the light of the present attitude adopted by
the plaintiff, stated by her Counsel at the outset of the proceedings,
that she
is not claiming any interest in the Balmoral property, but that the relief now
claimed by her is only by way of the payment
to her of a monetary sum, in the
amount of $100,000, it will not be necessary for me to make any determinations
concerning the beneficial
interests in that Balmoral home unit (or, indeed, in
the Vaucluse property).
<P>

36   	According to the plaintiff, throughout the period from
about January 1995 until July 1996 the plaintiff, at the request of
the
defendant each week drew a cheque on Dewcode payable to Zita Engels in the sum
of $150, cashed that cheque, and paid the proceeds
of that cashed cheque to the
defendant. 
<P>

37   	There was considerable cross-examination of the plaintiff
concerning those asserted financial transactions.
<P>

38   	There was filed and read on behalf of the defendant an
affidavit of Zita Engel [<i>sic</i>], nurse, of Stampe in Germany, in which the
deponent said that she was a resident of Germany and was acquainted with both
the plaintiff
and the defendant. Paragraph 2 of that affidavit as follows,
<P>

At no time have I received any monies [<i>sic</i>] whatsoever from Michael Gerd
Hugo Wiegand or from Dewcode Pty Limited. 
<P>

39   	The plaintiff did not seek to cross-examine Miss Engel
upon her affidavit.
<P>

40   	It was implicit in the assertions of the plaintiff
concerning these alleged financial transactions in relation to the regular
drawing of cheques in favour of Zita Engels (or Zita Engel) that the defendant
had received the benefit of $150 in cash each week
from Dewcode, and that,
presumably, that financial benefit was not disclosed either in the financial
accounts of that company or
to the taxation authorities. The defendant denied
receiving the amounts asserted by the plaintiff and denied the asserted
instructions
attributed to him by the plaintiff. 
<P>

41   	That cross-examination of the plaintiff on this topic
revealed significant correlation and a substantial degree of correspondence
between cheques drawn on Dewcode in favour of Z. Engels (usually one cheque, in
an amount of $600 each month) and deposits in identical,
or similar, amounts
made into the plaintiff's own cheque account.
<P>

42   	I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has established her
assertions concerning alleged weekly cheques for $150 drawn on Dewcode
and cash
payments to the defendant. On the contrary, however, I am satisfied, upon the
balance of probabilities, that it was the
plaintiff herself who received the
benefit of $600 in cash from Dewcode in each of fourteen months during the
period from March 1995
to June 1996. That benefit totals $8,400.
<P>

43   	It was asserted by the plaintiff that her contributions to
the relationship, both by way of direct financial contributions,
and also by
way of indirect financial contributions to the property and financial resources
of the defendant, and by way of contributions
in her capacity as homemaker,
were such as to entitle her to an order of the nature which she presently
claims. 
<P>

44   	The plaintiff relied upon the fact that throughout those
periods of the relationship whilst the parties were residing together
in the
Eastbourne Road property, in the Vaucluse property and in the Cremorne
property, the plaintiff was in full-time employment,
whilst the defendant,
until about March 1994 was not in employment in Australia (indeed, for a period
he was in receipt of unemployment
benefits); that the plaintiff substantially
assisted the defendant in acquiring his Australian professional qualifications,
that
assistance including the typing of two separate theses required by the
Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists,
and (in the
absence of the defendant overseas) liaising with two of his medical colleagues
concerning the final form of those theses;
negotiating the sale of his Mercedes
motor vehicle; attending to the defendant's banking and to the book keeping and
financial records
of the defendant (the plaintiff held the defendant's power of
attorney and was authorised to operate his bank accounts); in general,
attending to the entirety of the defendant's financial and business affairs
whilst the defendant was overseas. 
<P>

45   	The nature and the extent of the contributions of the
plaintiff to the relationship were the subject of considerable dispute
between
the parties. The defendant agreed that the plaintiff performed all the cooking
for the household, although he pointed to
the fact that he and the plaintiff
ate out about twice a week. (The culinary standards of the eateries patronised
by them was also
a matter of dispute.)The defendant agreed that the plaintiff
attended to the housekeeping aspects of their domestic establishment
in the
various residences which they occupied, and that she made direct financial
contributions towards the living expenses of the
parties, including the
purchase of food and household supplies. The defendant asserted that he also
made similar direct financial
contributions.
<P>

46   	During the course of the relationship the defendant in
late 1990 acquired a 29 foot Compass sailing boat for $29,000. The
plaintiff
asserted that she gave considerable assistance in the maintenance, cleaning and
outfitting of that sailing boat. The nature
and extent of any such assistance
was strongly disputed by the defendant. 
<P>

47   	It will be appreciated that, concerning the nature and
extent of many of the contributions of the kind which I have just described
which the plaintiff said she had made to the relationship, the evidence
consisted of assertions on the part of the plaintiff and
denials on the part of
the defendant. It is appropriate, therefore, that I should express my views
concerning the credibility of
each of those two parties, each of whom swore a
number of affidavits, and each of whom was cross-examined.
<P>

48   	I considered the plaintiff to be a most unsatisfactory
witness. At times during her oral evidence I regarded the plaintiff
as being
either deliberately obtuse or deliberately evasive. She constantly refused to
answer the question asked of her. With frequency
she resorted to responses of
not recollecting matters which clearly would have been within the ambit of her
memory. She refused to
make any concessions where concessions obviously should
have been made. She chose to be obstructive and evasive where agreement with
a
fact which was obviously true would not have been in any way detrimental to her
case. The plaintiff's attitude and approach in
the witness box did not attract
the sympathy of the Court, and did not advance her case in any way. She
constantly resorted to the
response, "I can't remember". Although the plaintiff
gave her occupation as "financial controller", her responses under
cross-examination
did not appear to me to be consistent with those of someone
who was experienced in and had knowledge of financial matters.
<P>

49   	The assertions of the plaintiff that it was she who,
during the defendant's absences, paid the rent on the Eastbourne Road
apartment, by weekly payments of $160, were patently false. 
<P>

50   	The plaintiff was cross-examined concerning the
proceedings (to which I have already referred) brought against her in the
Local
Court by the company Dewcoode after the termination of the relationship. Her
oral responses to that cross-examination concerning
her liability to Dewcode
were totally inconsistent with the sworn statement in that regard appearing in
paragraph 55 of her affidavit
of 26 February 1998.
<P>

51   	It also reflects poorly on the plaintiff's credit that,
despite an express request as long ago as September 1997, the plaintiff
had to
the time of the hearing failed to return documents of Dewcode and Havenpearl
(including blank pages of the stationery of those
companies bearing the
defendant's signature).
<P>

52   	By the same token, there were also a number of
unsatisfactory aspects to the evidence of the defendant. For example, he was
totally unable to explain the source of various deposits which had been made
into his bank account for the period May - October 1991.
Further, the assertion
of the defendant that he lent to the plaintiff the sum of $18,000 at the time
of the sale of the Darling Point
unit, and his reference to records contained
in blue cards (to which no previous reference had been made in either his
affidavit
evidence or his oral evidence to that point) I regarded as totally
unsatisfactory.
<P>

53   	However, where there is a conflict between the evidence of
the plaintiff and the evidence of the defendant and where there
is no other
material (for example, independent evidence or documentary material) which
would assist the Court in resolving that conflict,
I prefer the evidence of the
defendant to that of the plaintiff. It should also be appreciated that it is
the plaintiff who, as the
person making the claim, must discharge the burden of
proof in satisfying the Court of her entitlement to the relief which she is
seeking. (The only relief which the defendant seeks by way of the cross-claim,
being the transfer to him of the plaintiff's shares
in the two companies, is
consented to by the plaintiff.)
<P>

54   	The two areas in respect of which the plaintiff possibly
appeared to have established contributions which would entitle her
to relief in
the present proceedings are, firstly, the inference which the Court is entitled
to draw from the totality of the evidence
that it was the earnings of the
plaintiff which were supporting the defendant whilst he was unemployed in
Australia; and, secondly,
the contributions which the plaintiff made to the
relationship in her capacity as homemaker. 
<P>

55   	In respect to the assertion that the plaintiff was
supporting the defendant whilst he was unemployed in Australia, it should
be
recognised, however, that it was the explanation offered by the defendant that
throughout those periods whilst he was not in receipt
of income in Australia he
was relying on his savings, which he had accumulated from his professional
employment in Germany and in
the United Arab Emirates. 
<P>

56   	It must also be recognised that at the commencement of the
relationship the plaintiff's residence at Darling Point was subject
to a
mortgage (which she later consolidated with other debts when she obtained a
single mortgage in the sum of $86,000), and that
her liabilities at that time
exceeded her assets. Those facts make somewhat unlikely the assertion of the
plaintiff that for the
periods whilst the defendant was resident in Australia
from January 1989 until about March 1994 he was being supported by the
plaintiff.

<P>

57   	Further, the plaintiff had the benefit of free
accommodation throughout a period of seven and a half years, and for about
half
of that period the plaintiff alone was enjoying the benefit of the totality of
that accommodation (whilst the defendant was
practising his profession
overseas).
<P>

58   	It reflected poorly upon the case advanced by the
plaintiff that it appeared to be a complaint on her part that she contributed
the entirety of the payments in respect to such outgoings in relation to the
Eastbourne Road property, the Vaucluse property and
the Cremorne property as
telephone, electricity and gas (assertions which, in any event, were disputed
by the defendant) during period
whilst the only person having the benefit of
those telephone, electricity and gas facilities was the plaintiff herself. 
<P>

59   	Further, it should be appreciated that the plaintiff also
received the benefit of at least one overseas trip every year, in
respect of
which the defendant paid her air fares (although the plaintiff appears to have
contributed equally to accommodation, meals
and the like), and that she also
received some gifts by way of jewellery.
<P>

60   	The plaintiff also sought to rely upon direct assistance
which she had given to the preparation of the defendant's theses
and to the
conduct of his service companies, and to his business and financial affairs in
Australia. As to the theses, I consider
that the evidence of the plaintiff's
contributions was grossly exaggerated. Similarly, I am satisfied that the
banking and other
business activities performed by the plaintiff for the
defendant were not of a particularly time consuming nature.
<P>

61   	Throughout the periods whilst the defendant was overseas
the plaintiff had the benefit of accommodation in premises either
owned or
rented by the defendant, and was responsible for the payment of outgoings in
respect of which she had the exclusive benefit.
For those periods the plaintiff
was receiving a considerable financial and practical benefit from being in a de
facto relationship
with the defendant. 
<P>

62   	I have already expressed my conclusion that, in addition,
the plaintiff in 1995 - 1996 received from Dewcode direct financial
benefits
totalling $8,400.
<P>

63   	On the other hand, however, it should not be overlooked
that there were practical advantages to the defendant in having someone
available to live in and look after his various residences in Sydney and to
attend to what might be described as the Australian part
of his life whilst he
was working and travelling overseas.
<P>

64   	Throughout the periods whilst the defendant was resident
with the plaintiff in New South Wales, I am satisfied that the plaintiff
made
contributions in her capacity as homemaker, and that she also made
contributions by way of assisting the defendant in such matters
as the
preparation of his theses, attending to his business affairs and to his
financial records and banking (which she also attended
to during his absence).
Since the plaintiff was in full-time employment throughout those periods,
whilst (until about March 1994)
the defendant was not in employment, but was,
according to him, supporting himself from his savings, the inference is open to
the
Court that, at least to some extent, the plaintiff was supporting the
defendant from her income. The plaintiff has not, however,
established any
quantification of such support. 
<P>

65   	The contributions of the plaintiff as homemaker (although
considerably less than asserted by her) should not, however, be
disregarded. I
have reached the conclusion, consonant with the principles enunciated by the
Court of Appeal in <i>Evans v Marmont</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1997/331.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] NSWSC 331</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%2070" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 70</a> per Gleeson CJ and
McLelland CJ in Eq., that the plaintiff has established an entitlement to an
order that the defendant pay to her
the sum of $20,000, and I propose so to
order.
<P>

66   	Since that sum is considerably less than the limit of the
jurisdiction of the Local Court the plaintiff, pursuant to the provisions
of
Part 52 rule 24A of the Supreme Court Rules, is not entitled to an order for
her costs unless the Court otherwise orders. I have
not heard any submissions
concerning costs. Accordingly, unless within seven days of the date hereof
either party arranges with my
Associate to have the matter listed before me for
argument as to costs, I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the defendant pay to the plaintiff the sum of $20,000.
<P>

2.	I order that the claim of the plaintiff be otherwise dismissed.
<P>

3.	I order that the plaintiff within fourteen days of the date hereof transfer
to the defendant all her right, title and interest
in:
<P>

(a)	her shares in Havenpearl Pty Limited; and
<P>

(b)	her shares in Dewcode Pty Limited.
<P>

4.	I reserve to the defendant liberty to apply in respect to order 3 hereof.
<P>

5.	I make no order as to costs, to the intent that each party will bear her or
his own costs of the proceedings. 
<P>
