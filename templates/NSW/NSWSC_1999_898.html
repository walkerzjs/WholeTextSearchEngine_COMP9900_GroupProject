<b><u>2060/96	HENRY VICTOR GERTSCH	v	ASPASIA ATSAS &amp; 2 ORS </u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiff in these proceedings is the
administrator of the estate of his half brother, Ludwig Gertsch, who
died on or
about 19 October 1990.  The proceedings were originally brought against three
defendants.  They have been disposed of
as against the first defendant and now
relate only to the second defendant, George Fidirikkos, and the third
defendant, Maria Hamilton.
 Each of these defendants had received, in 1991,
pecuniary legacies paid to them pursuant to the provisions of a purported will
of
the deceased, which was later proved to be a forgery.  
<P>

2   	The plaintiff, to whom letters of administration were
granted on 26 September 1995 and who is the sole beneficiary of the deceased's
intestate estate, seeks to recover the amount of these legacies, together with
interest.  In doing so, he invokes the equitable doctrines
of tracing,
subrogation and constructive trust.  He also claims restitution of the moneys
paid on the grounds of unjust enrichment
of the defendants.  
<P>

3   	The defendants deny that the equitable remedies are
available in the circumstances of the case.  They each assert the defence
of
"change of position" to the restitution claim. 
<P>

4   	These claims and defences and their bases in law will be
the subject of consideration in these reasons.  It is convenient,
however, to
set out, at this stage, certain facts by way of background.
<P>

<b>Background:</b>
<P>

5   	Ludwig Gertsch ("Mr Gertsch") was a homosexual man.  It
appears that he had relationships with homosexual partners which were
of
extended duration.  Prior to April 1990, he had had such a relationship with a
Mr Roger Tesseydre ("Mr Tesseydre"), who died in
that month.  Mr Gertsch
inherited most of the estate of Mr Tesseydre pursuant to the latter's will.
Although there is no precise
evidence in the case, it was quite apparent that
it was an estate of very substantial size.  It also appears, in a general way,
from
the evidence that the deceased's inheritance occasioned disappointment and
perhaps jealousy in persons, whose identity does not appear
in the evidence,
who might have expected to be, themselves, the object of Mr Tesseydre's bounty.
It also appears from the evidence,
again in a general way, that Mr Gertsch was
apprehensive that some harm might be done to him, at least towards the end of
1990. 
He expressed these concerns to each of the defendants, both of whom were
close friends.  
<P>

6   	In 1990, after the death of Mr Tesseydre, Mr Gertsch formed
another relationship with a Mr Esposito.  It does not appear that
this
relationship had matured into a definite partnership, but Mr Gertsch had
developed a deep affection for the other man.
<P>

7   	In October 1990, in mysterious circumstances, to which more
detailed reference will be made later, Mr Gertsch disappeared.
 In November his
dead body was found in a shallow grave in the Blue Mountains, in circumstances
clearly indicative of foul play.
 
<P>

8   	Mr Gertsch had had as his solicitor a Mr Brian Roberts.  He
attended to the legal aspects of Mr Gertsch's business affairs
and also to the
preparation of wills, or at least draft wills, on Mr Gertsch's behalf.  It
appears that Mr Gertsch was inclined to
change his testamentary intentions,
although whether this took the form of revocation of wills formally made, or
simply making alterations
to drafts of intended wills, is not clear on the
evidence.  It appears that he made a will in 1985 which left the bulk of the
estate
to Mr Tesseydre, who, of course, pre-deceased him.  That will has
achieved no significance in these proceedings.  However, after
Mr Gertsch's
death, Mr Roberts, who was known to the defendants and other friends of the
deceased, produced a will of the deceased
dated 7 September 1990 (The Will).
It contained the pecuniary legacies in question in these proceedings.
<P>

9   	The deceased's residuary estate was of considerable size.
It was left to Mr Esposito.  The Will appointed Mr Roberts as executor.
 On 11
January 1991, Mr Roberts was granted probate of the Will.  On 22 January 1991,
he paid to the third defendant, by cheque,
the sum of $100,000, being the
amount of her legacy.  On 22 January 1991, he paid, by cheque, to the second
defendant the amount
of $150,000 and on 25 August 1991, paid to him, by cheque,
a further sum of $150,000, the two sums constituting the amount of his
legacy.
<P>

10   	The Will had been forged by Mr Roberts.  The signature of
Mr Gertsch was not his signature.  The purported attesting witnesses
had not
attested the document.  On 11 December 1992, Roberts was arrested and charged
with a number of offences in connection with
the forgery of the will and the
administration by him of the decease's estate, as its purported executor.  He
was ultimately convicted
of the offences and received a term of
imprisonment.
<P>

11   	Prior to these events, the deceased's mother, Emmah
Gertsch, had died on 27 November 1990.  On the basis that Mr Gertsch had
died
intestate, she inherited his estate.  On her death, the plaintiff became the
inheritor of her estate, she also having died intestate.
 The plaintiff was
later appointed administrator of her estate.
<P>

12   	On 11 December 1992, the plaintiff, Roberts having been
arrested, obtained an injunction restraining him from dealing with
the assets
of the estate of Mr Gertsch.  On 23 December 1992, the plaintiff obtained the
appointment of one William John Widon as
administrator of the personal estate
and receiver of the real estate of Ludwig Gertsch, then unadministered and
undistributed.  On
19 May 1993, the plaintiff was granted special letters of
administration in respect of his mother's estate.  On 17 June 1993, by
statement of claim filed in the Probate Division of this Court, he sought
orders against Roberts that the grant of probate made on
11 January 1991 be
revoked and that administration of the estate be granted to him.  
<P>

13   	On 16 December 1994, orders were made by Hodgson J that
the grant of probate of 11 January 1991 to Roberts be revoked and
that
administration of the estate be granted to the plaintiff.  These orders were
stayed to enable letters to be sent to the second
and third defendants advising
them of the situation.  Various other steps were taken which it is not
necessary to detail.  Ultimately,
the order revoking probate was entered on 28
August 1995.  On 26 September 1995, letters of administration of the estate of
Ludwig
Gertsch were granted to the plaintiff.
<P>

14   	On 22 March 1996, letters of demand were sent by the
plaintiff's solicitors to the second and third defendants requiring repayment
of the legacies.  Payment not having been made, these proceedings were
commenced on 8 May 1996.  
<P>

15   	As the circumstances relating to each defendant are
different, it is necessary to consider their cases separately.  It is
convenient to consider that of the third defendant first.  
<P>

<b>The case against the third defendant:</b>
<P>

16   	The evidence in the case was given by way of affidavit,
together with oral testimony.  The affidavit of the third defendant
indicates
that she received the legacy of $100,000 on 4 February 1991 and that between
February 1991 and December 1992 she expended
the money.  She paid off the
mortgage debt on her home at 20 Hart Street, Balmain, in the amount of $68,614.
She also repaid a personal
loan obtained from her bank in respect of the
purchase of a car, in the sum of $910, paid legal fees owing to a firm of
solicitors,
in the amount of $132, and paid the charges on her Grace Bros
credit card as at 26 February 1991, in the sum of $593.
<P>

17   	As to the balance, she provided the following information
in her affidavit as to the amount of the expenditure and her reasons
for it:
<P>

"The remainder of the bequest was spent in the following way:-
<P>

Education							     $4,936.00
<P>

This expenditure related to my university course ($1,495.00) and my sons'
education.  Some 2/3 of what I spent on education was
for extra classes and
special projects, master classes and grade exams for my sons which were
undertaken only because I suddenly
had the money to pay for them.  In 1990, my
expenditure on ballet and music had been $1,092.00, and the increase above this
level
was not essential to the children's development in these fields.
<P>

Household Improvements						     $3,637.00
<P>

I had the house repainted at a cost of $1,430.00 approximately.  This was
entirely unnecessary, as it was relatively new.  Having
done without carpet for
several years, I had the house carpeted at a cost of $1,719.00 approximately.
Having done without blinds
on various windows, I bought blinds at a cost of
$448.00 approximately.   None of these improvements was necessary, and I did
them
only because I suddenly had the money.
<P>

Credit Card							     $3,613.00
<P>

These were items such as perfume, expensive cosmetics, clothes, CDs for the
children, bed linen and books.  They were mostly items
that I would not have
bought without the money from Luddie's bequest.  By way of comparison, whereas
my American Express purchases
totalled $995.00 for 1991, in 1993 (after the
bequest was spent) they were only $235.00.  Similarly, on my Grace Brothers
credit
card the total was $1,976.00 in 1991 but only $505.00 in 1993.
<P>

Gifts								     $3,258.00
<P>

I would have incurred little, if any, of this expenditure if I had not received
the bequest.  During this period I decided to give
my sons pocket money.  The
total of pocket money for the year was $1,664.00 approx.  My sons did not
previously get pocket money
and I ceased giving it to them in early 1992.  I
also gave my sons other gifts, toys and clothes.  For instance I purchased a
pair
of Nike shoes for Julian, I also paid for Julian's subscription to Rolling
Stone magazine.
<P>

Medical - Medicare Private					     $2,738.00
<P>

I decided in 1991 to take out private medical insurance at the family rate.  I
did not have private medical cover at the time and
to the best of my
recollection I allowed the cover to lapse in late 1993.
<P>

Cash Withdrawals 1991						     $8,660.00
<P>

Cash Withdrawals 1992						     $2,720.00
<P>

The cash withdrawals were in small amounts ($100.00, $200.00) during the period
from February, 1991 to approximately October, 1992.
 Averaged over this period,
the expenditure was approximately $790.00 per month in 1991 and $302.00 per
month in 1992.  This money
was spent in ways which were not usual for me.  Some
of it went in eating out with the children at a variety of restaurants.  I
changed
my domestic habits and bought takeaway food often.  I cooked very
little in 1991, which is uncharacteristic as I have always enjoyed
cooking.
<P>

During 1991 and 1992 I developed a number of abnormal behavioural
characteristics including excessive smoking and drinking, gambling
and
excessive spending.  These were associated with depression which went so far as
to lead me one occasion to attempted suicide.
 I believe that this behaviour
was due to the intense grief, stress and fears arising from the murder of
Luddie and my concerns about
those responsible, and the safely (sic) of myself
and the children.  I was frustrated by the lack of progress in Luddie's murder
investigation.  I had the misguided notion that I might find out something
about his death from other sources, and so began to go
to Harold Park Paceway
and Wentworth Park Greyhound Track in the belief that through gambling I might
meet people with criminal connections.
 My behaviour at this time was very
confused, and was accompanied by excessive drinking to overcome my fears as
well as feelings
of impotence, rage, guilt and grief.  Although I find it
difficult in retrospect to analyse my irrational behaviour rationally, I
do not
believe that I would have responded to these stresses by excessive spending if
I had not enough money left to satisfy needs
of ordinary living, especially for
the children.
<P>

Total Spent							    $29,562.00
<P>

<b>Total bequest accounted for:					    $99,811.00</b>"
<P>

18   	The case against the third defendant differs from that
against the second defendant, in that reliance is placed by the plaintiff
upon
a proprietary claim in equity, utilising the doctrines of tracing and
subrogation.  This claim relates only to the payment made
by the third
defendant to discharge the mortgage upon her home at 20 Hart Street,
Balmain.
<P>

19   	Her own evidence makes is quite clear that a portion of
the disputed legacy of $100,000 was utilised for the purpose of discharging
this mortgage, the amount in question being $68,614.  There is, therefore, no
problem relating to the tracing of that amount into
the discharge of that
security for her benefit.  Equally, it is quite clear that she received the
amount as a result of the breach
of fiduciary duty by Mr Roberts, as executor
de son tort of the estate of Mr Gertsch.  The plaintiff, as administrator of
that estate,
was entitled to follow the money, as trust money, into her hands
and point to its use in the discharging of the mortgage.  As the
money was used
to discharge, in full, the existing security, the claim is made by the
plaintiff that he should be subrogated to the
position of the mortgagee, with
the result that he should be given by the court an equitable charge over the
property, to secure
the repayment to the estate of the amount paid in discharge
of the mortgage plus interest.  It is not now claimed that the payment
discharging the mortgage entitled the estate to a pro rata interest in the
property itself.  Clearly enough, such a claim would be
untenable.  See per
Millett LJ in <b>Boscawen v Bajwa </b><a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1995/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] EWCA Civ 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20WLR%20328" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 WLR 328</a> at 335.
<P>

20   	Although it is quite clear, on the facts of this case,
that the moneys in question, improperly paid to the third defendant,
as the
result of a breach of trust on the part of Roberts, were utilised in the
repayment of the mortgage, it does not necessarily
follow that the plaintiff is
entitled to the charge sought by way of subrogation.  Although this might have
appeared to be the position
in accordance with early authority (see <b>Black v
S Freedman &amp; Co </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1910/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1910] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281910%29%2012%20CLR%20105" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1910) 12 CLR 105</a> at 110), regard must now be paid to
development in the law since that time.  Defences are now available to a person
in the position
of a volunteer which were not previously available.  The matter
is fully discussed in the judgment of Millett LJ in <b>Boscawen </b>at 334-335
in the following passage:
<P>

"Equity lawyers habitually use the expressions "the tracing claim" and "the
tracing remedy" to describe the proprietary claim and
the proprietary remedy
which equity makes available to the beneficial owner who seeks to recover his
property in specie from those
into whose hands it has come.  Tracing properly
so-called, however, is neither a claim nor a remedy but a process.  Moreover,
it
is not confined to the case where the plaintiff seeks a proprietary remedy;
it is equally necessary where he seeks a personal remedy
against the knowing
recipient or knowing assistant.  It is the process by which the plaintiff
traces what has happened to his property,
identifies the persons who have
handled or received it, and justifies his claim that the money which they
handled or received (and,
if necessary, which they still retain) can properly
be regarded as representing his property.  He needs to do this because his
claim
is based on the retention by him of a beneficial interest in the property
which the defendant handled or received.  Unless he can
prove this he cannot
(in the traditional language of equity) raise an equity against the defendant
or (in the modern language of
restitution) show that the defendant's unjust
enrichment was at his expense.
<P>

In such a case the defendant will either challenge the plaintiff's claim that
the property in question represents his property (i.e.,
he will challenge the
validity of the tracing exercise) or he will raise a priority dispute (e.g., by
claiming to be a bona fide
purchaser without notice).  If all else fails he
will raise the defence of innocent change of position.  This was not a defence
which
was recognised in England before 1991 but it was widely accepted
throughout the common law world.  In <i>Lipkin Gorman v. Karpnale Ltd.
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%202%20AC%20548" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 2 A.C. 548</a> the House of Lords acknowledged it to be part of English
law also.  The introduction of this defence not only provides the court
with a
means of doing justice in future, but allows a re-examination of many decisions
of the past in which the absence of the defence
may have led judges to distort
basic principles in order to avoid injustice to the defendant.
<P>

If the plaintiff succeeds in tracing his property, whether in its original or
in some changed form, into the hands of the defendant,
and overcomes any
defences which are put forward on the defendant's behalf, he is entitled to a
remedy.  The remedy will be fashioned
to the circumstances. 
<P>

...
<P>

[I]f the plaintiff's money has been used to discharge a mortgage on the
defendant's land, then the court may achieve a similar result
by treating the
land as subject to a charge by way of subrogation in favour of the
plaintiff."
<P>

	(See also <b>Foskett v McKeown </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%202%20WLR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 2 WLR 298).</a>
<P>

21   	In <b>Banque Financiere de la Cit&eacute; v Parc
(Battersea) Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] UKHL 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%202%20WLR%20475" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 2 WLR 475</a>, Lord Hoffmann, in his speech in the House
of Lords, said at 487-488:
<P>

"It is important to remember that, as Millett L.J. pointed out in <i>Boscawen
v. Bajwa </i><a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1995/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] EWCA Civ 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20WLR%20328" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 W.L.R. 328</a>, 335, subrogation is not a right or a cause of
action but an equitable remedy against a party who would otherwise be unjustly
enriched.
 It is a means by which the court regulates the legal relationships
between a plaintiff and a defendant or defendants in order to
prevent unjust
enrichment.  When judges say that the charge is "kept alive" for the benefit of
the plaintiff, what they mean is that
his legal relations with a defendant who
would otherwise be unjustly enriched are regulated <i>as if</i> the benefit of
the charge had been assigned to him.  It does not by any means follow that the
plaintiff must for all purposes be
treated as an actual assignee of the benefit
of the charge and, in particular, that he would be so treated in relation to
someone
who would not be unjustly enriched."
<P>

22   	It is plain, in my view, that it is reasonable to regard
"proprietary" claims, at least in respect of moneys provided, in
breach of
trust, to a defendant who is, relevantly, an innocent volunteer as being
comprehended within claims relating to "unjust
enrichment" and as being
susceptible to defences appropriate to such claims.  In particular, the defence
of "change of position"
on the part of the defendant may be raised.
<P>

23   	The existence of this defence has been recognised for
Australia in the decision of the High Court in <b>David Securities Pty Ltd v
Commonwealth Bank of Australia </b>(1992<b>) </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 48</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=175%20CLR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">175 CLR 353</a> at 379, 380 and
384.  I am satisfied, therefore, that, as a matter of law, the defence is
available to the third defendant in these
proceedings.
<P>

24   	As a claim is made by the plaintiff against the third
defendant for restitution of the whole amount of the legacy of $100,000,
on the
basis of unjust enrichment, to which claim change of position has been pleaded,
I shall defer a consideration of the law in
relation to this defence and of the
relevant facts of this case, until I come to consider that aspect of the
plaintiff's claim.
<P>

25   	The plaintiff also claims against the third defendant on
the basis that she became a constructive trustee of the amount of
the legacy
upon receipt of it and, accordingly, should account to the plaintiff for the
full amount of the legacy plus interest from
the date of its receipt.  As the
imposition of a constructive trust is based upon some degree of blameworthiness
on the part of the
defendant, the nature of which I shall consider later, and
the defence of change of position is based upon the innocence of the defendant,
it is clear that the defence is not available to resist a claim for
constructive trust.  It is convenient, therefore, to consider,
now, the
plaintiff's claim that the third defendant became a trustee for him of the
amount of the legacy.  I shall consider, in the
first place, what appear to be
the relevant principles of law.
<P>

<b>The Law as to Constructive Trusts:</b>
<P>

26   	The trust alleged by the plaintiff to have been imposed
upon the third defendant in the circumstances of this case is based
upon
"knowing receipt".  An early formulation of the circumstances in which a trust
would be imposed in a case of "knowing assistance"
is to be found in the
well-known passage from <b>Barnes v Addy</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281874%29%209%20LRCh%20App%20244" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1874) 9 Ch App 244.</a>  In that
case, Lord Selborne LC said at 251-252:
<P>

"Now in this case we have to deal with certain persons who are trustees, and
with certain other persons who are not trustees.  That
is a distinction to be
borne in mind throughout the case.  Those who create a trust clothe the trustee
with a legal power and control
over the trust property, imposing on him a
corresponding responsibility.  That responsibility may no doubt be extended in
equity
to others who are not properly trustees, if they are found either making
themselves trustees de son tort, or actually participating
in any fraudulent
conduct of the trustee to the injury of the cestui que trust.  But, on the
other hand, strangers are not to be
made constructive trustees merely because
they act as the agents of trustees in transactions within their legal powers,
transactions,
perhaps of which a court of equity may disapprove, unless those
agents receive and become chargeable with some part of the trust
property, or
unless they assist with knowledge in a dishonest and fraudulent design on the
part of the trustees."
<P>

27   	The type of knowledge in a defendant requisite for
imposition upon him or her of the obligations of constructive trustee,
in cases
of "knowing assistance", involves, in the opinion of Lord Selborne, complicity
in the fraud and dishonesty involved in the
original breach of trust.  In terms
of the present case, the third defendant could be constituted a constructive
trustee of the legacy,
on that basis, only if she received it knowing that it
was being paid to her as part of a dishonest and fraudulent design on the
part
of the solicitor, Roberts. 
<P>

28   	It is clear, however, that the law, as it has developed,
does not postulate such a high degree of knowledge of dishonesty,
in cases of
"knowing receipt" of a trust property.  Discussion of the question now centres
around a formulation in the judgment of
Peter Gibson J in <b>Baden v Societe
Generale</b><i> <b>SA</b></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%201%20WLR%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 1 WLR 509</a> at 575-576, where there was
dissected out, from earlier cases, five categories of knowledge in a recipient
which were regarded as
sufficient to base the imposition of a constructive
trust for the "knowing receipt" of property or moneys provided to the
recipient,
in breach of trust.  The categories are as follows:
<P>

"(1)	actual knowledge;
<P>

(2)	wilfully shutting one's eyes to the obvious;
<P>

(3)	wilfully and recklessly failing to make such enquiries as an honest and
reasonable man would make;
<P>

(4)	knowledge of circumstances which would indicate the facts to an honest and
reasonable man;
<P>

(5)	knowledge of circumstances which would put an honest and reasonable man on
enquiry."
<P>

29   	These categories have been the subject of some controversy
in judicial decisions and academic writings.  The material is extensive.
 I
shall not refer to all of it..
<P>

30   	In <b>Polly Peck International plc v Nadir (No. 2)</b>
<a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1992/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] EWCA Civ 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%204%20All%20ER%20769" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 4 All ER 769</a>, Scott LJ (at 777), having indicated that the <b>Barnes v
Addy</b> standard of knowledge was appropriate in cases of alleged "knowing
assistance" dealt with the appropriate standard in cases of "knowing
receipt"
as follows:
<P>

     "Liability as constructive trustee in a `knowing receipt' case does not
require that the misapplication of the trust funds
should be fraudulent.  It
does require that the defendant should have knowledge that the funds were trust
funds and that they were
being misapplied.  Actual knowledge obviously will
suffice.  Mr Potts has submitted that it will suffice if the defendant can be
shown to have had knowledge of facts which would have put an honest and
reasonable man on inquiry, or, at least, if the defendant
can be shown to have
wilfully and recklessly failed to make such inquiries as an honest and
reasonable man would have made (see categories
(iii) and (v) of the categories
of mental state identified by Peter Gibson J in <i>Baden's </i>case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%204%20All%20ER%20161" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 4
All ER 161</a> at 235).  I do not think there is any doubt that, if the latter of
the two criteria can be established against the Central Bank,
that will
suffice.  I have some doubts about the sufficiency of the former criterion but
do not think that the present appeal is
the right occasion for settling the
issue.  The various categories of mental state identified in <i>Baden's</i>
case are not rigid categories with clear and precise boundaries.  One category
may merge imperceptibly into another."
<P>

31   	Also, in <b>In re Montagu's Settlement Trusts</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%201%20Ch%20264" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1987] 1
Ch 264</a>, Sir Robert Megarry VC, having posed the question (at 276) "what
suffices to constitute a recipient of trust property a constructive
trustee of
it" considered cases including the <b>Baden </b>case.  He said (at 277):
<P>

"In determining whether a constructive trust has been created, the fundamental
question is whether the conscience of the recipient
is bound in such a way as
to justify equity in imposing a trust on him."
<P>

32   	He noted that there was a difference between the concept
of "constructive notice" as it was well known in equitable doctrine
and the
type of knowledge that was the subject of investigation in the area of
constructive trusteeship.  He said (at 278):
<P>

"The cold calculus of constructive and imputed notice does not seem to me to be
an appropriate instrument for deciding whether a
man's conscience is
sufficiently affected for it to be right to bind him by the obligations of a
constructive trustee."
<P>

33   	In relation to the <b>Baden </b>categories, Sir Robert
said (at 278-279):
<P>

"Accordingly, although I readily approach the five categories of knowledge set
out in the <i>Baden</i> case  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%20BCLC%20325" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] B.C.L.C. 325</a> as useful guides, I regard
them primarily as aids in determining whether or not the Duke's conscience was
affected in such a way
as to require him to hold any or all of the chattels
that he received on a constructive trust.
<P>

     There is one further general consideration that I should mention, and that
is that "the court should not be astute to impute
knowledge where no actual
knowledge exists":  see the <i>Baden</i> case at p. 415, <i>per </i>Peter
Gibson J.  This approach goes back at least as far as <i>Barnes v. Addy</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281874%29%209%20LRCh%20App%20244" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1874) 9 Ch.App. 244</a>, 251, 252.  The view of James L.J., at p. 256, was that
the court had in some cases
<P>

"gone to the very verge of justice in making good to cestuis que trust the
consequences of the breaches of trust of their trustees
at the expense of
persons perfectly honest, but who have been, in some more or less degree,
injudicious."
<P>

     Of the five categories of knowledge set out in the <i>Baden</i> case
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%20BCLC%20325" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] B.C.L.C. 325</a>, Mr. Chadwick, as well as Mr. Taylor, accepted the first
three.  What was in issue was nos. (iv) and (v), namely, knowledge of
circumstances
which "would indicate the facts to an honest and reasonable man"
or "would put an honest and reasonable man on inquiry."  On the
view that I
take of the present case I do not think that it really matters whether or not
categories (iv) and (v) are included, but
as the matter has been argued at
length, and further questions on it may arise, I think I should say something
about it.
<P>

     First, as I have already indicated, I think that one has to be careful to
distinguish the notice that is relevant in the doctrine
of purchaser without
notice from the knowledge that suffices for the imposition of a constructive
trust.  This is shown by a short
passage in the long judgment of the Court of
Appeal in <i>In re Diplock</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1948%5d%20Ch%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1948] Ch. 465</a>, 478, 479.  There, it was pointed
out that on the facts of that case persons unversed in the law were entitled to
assume that the
executors were properly administering the estate, and that if
those persons received money bona fide believing themselves to be entitled
to
it, "they should not have imposed upon them the heavy obligations of
trusteeship."  The judgment then pointed out:
<P>

"the principles applicable to such cases are not the same as the principles in
regard to notice of defects in title applicable to
transfers of land where
regular machinery has long since been established  for inquiry and
investigation."
<P>

34   	Later (at 280), he pointed to the fact that classes (iv)
and (v) in <b>Baden</b> were not governed by the words "wilfully and
recklessly", but were, instead, "cases of carelessness or negligence being
tested by
what an honest and reasonable man would have realised or would have
inquired about, even if the person concerned was, for instance,
not at all
reasonable".  After some further reference to authority, he noted (at 281) that
Sachs and Edmund Davies LJJ in the case
of <b>Carl Zeiss Stiftung v Herbert
Smith &amp; Co (No. 2)</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%202%20Ch%20276" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] 2 Ch 276</a>, had concluded that "negligence is
not enough and that there must be dishonesty, a conscious impropriety or a lack
of probity before
liability as a constructive trustee is imposed."
<P>

35   	The position in England would now appear to be governed by
the decision of the Privy Council in <b>Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1995/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] UKPC 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%202%20AC%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995]
2 AC 378.</a>  In that case, their Lordships had to consider circumstances in which
a constructive trust should be imposed.  They said (at 387):
<P>

"Given, then, that in some circumstances a third party may be liable directly
to a beneficiary, but given also that the liability
is not so strict that there
would be liability even when the third party was wholly unaware of the
existence of the trust, the next
step is to seek to identify the touchstone of
liability.  By common accord dishonesty fulfils this role.  Whether, in
addition, negligence
will suffice is an issue on which there has been a
well-known difference of judicial opinion."
<P>

36   	There follows a comprehensive exposition of decided cases
on this topic, including Australian authority to which I shall make
reference
later, but, after indicating that most of the academic commentators preferred
the test of dishonesty, their Lordships considered
what "dishonesty" meant in
this context.  They said (at 389):
<P>

"... in the context of the accessory liability principle acting dishonestly, or
with a lack of probity, which is synonymous, means
simply not acting as an
honest person would in the circumstances.  This is an objective standard.  At
first sight this may seem surprising.
 Honesty has a connotation of
subjectivity, as distinct from the objectivity of negligence.  Honesty, indeed,
does have a strong
subjective element in that it is a description of a type of
conduct assessed in the light of what a person actually knew at the time,
as
distinct from what a reasonable person would have known or appreciated.
Further, honesty and its counterpart dishonesty are mostly
concerned with
advertent conduct, not inadvertent conduct.  Carelessness is not dishonesty.
Thus for the most part dishonesty is
to be equated with conscious impropriety.
However, these subjective characteristics of honesty do not mean that
individuals are free
to set their own standards of honesty in particular
circumstances.  The standard of what constitutes honest conduct is not
subjective.
 Honesty is not an optional scale, with higher or lower values
according to the moral standards of each individual.  If a person
knowingly
appropriates another's property, he will not escape a finding of dishonesty
simply because he sees nothing wrong in such
behaviour.
<P>

In most situations there is little difficulty in identifying how an honest
person would behave.  Honest people do not intentionally
deceive others to
their detriment.  Honest people do not knowingly take others' property.  Unless
there is a very good and compelling
reason, an honest person does not
participate in a transaction if he knows it involves a misapplication of trust
assets to the detriment
of the beneficiaries.  Nor does an honest person in
such a case deliberately close his eyes and ears, or deliberately not ask
questions,
lest he learn something he would rather not know, and then proceed
regardless."
<P>

37   	After consideration of various types of situation, their
Lordships made the following general observations (at 390-391):
<P>

     "The only answer to these questions lies in keeping in mind that honesty
is an objective standard.  The individual is expected
to attain the standard
which would be observed by an honest person placed in those circumstances (and)
... when called upon to decide
whether a person was acting honestly, a court
will look at all the circumstances known to the third party at the time.  The
court
will also have regard to personal attributes of the third party, such as
his experience and intelligence, and the reason why he acted
as he did."
<P>

38   	There Lordships concluded (at 392) that "dishonesty is a
necessary ingredient of accessory liability (and that) "Knowingly"
is better
avoided as a defining ingredient of the principle, and in the context of this
principle the <i>Baden</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%201%20WLR%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] 1 WLR 509</a> scale of knowledge is best
forgotten."
<P>

39   	It might be thought that the situation in England is now
tolerably clear.  What is the position in Australia?  It appears
that the High
Court has not considered the question since its decision in <b>Consul
Development Pty Ltd v DPC Estates Pty Ltd </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1975/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1975] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%2d1975%29%20132%20CLR%20373" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974-1975) 132 CLR 373.</a>  In that
case the following statements of principle appear.  Gibbs J (at 398) said:
<P>

"It may be that it is going too far to say that a stranger will be liable if
the circumstances would have put an honest and reasonable
man on inquiry, when
the stranger's failure to inquire has been innocent and he has not wilfully
shut his eyes to the obvious.  On
the other hand, it does not seem to me to be
necessary to prove that a stranger who participated in a breach of trust or
fiduciary
duty with knowledge of all the circumstances did so actually knowing
that what he was doing was improper.  It would not be just that
a person who
had full knowledge of all the facts could escape liability because his own
moral obtuseness prevented him from recognizing
an impropriety that would have
been apparent to an ordinary man."
<P>

40   	Also Stephen J said (with the concurrence of Barwick CJ)
(at 412):
<P>

"In my view the state of the authorities as they existed before <i>Selangor</i>
did not go so far, at least in cases where the defendant had neither received
nor dealt in property impressed with any trust, as
to apply to them that
species of constructive notice which serves to expose a party to liability
because of negligence in failing
to make inquiry.  If a defendant knows of
facts which themselves would, to a reasonable man, tell of fraud or breach of
trust the
case may well be different, as it clearly will be if the defendant
has consciously refrained from enquiry for fear lest he learn
of fraud.  But to
go further is, I think, to disregard equity's concern for the state of
conscience of the defendant."
<P>

41   	In <b>Equiticorp Finance Ltd v Bank of New Zealand</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2032%20NSWLR%2050" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 32 NSWLR 50</a>, Kirby P (as he then was) after a consideration of <b>Consul
</b>and <b>Baden</b> said, in a dissenting judgment, (at 104):
<P>

    "In Australia, the only guidance of the High Court is to be found in
<i>Consul</i>.  It appears to be suggested that, in the case of participation
in a breach of trust, a stranger to the trust will be liable at least
if the
"requisite degree of knowledge" in the categories 1 to 4, as stated in
<i>Baden</i>, are made out.  In such a case, the stranger will be liable to
compensate the beneficiary."
<P>

42   	Accordingly, formulations on this topic in Australian
decisions do not refer directly to concepts such as "impropriety" or
"want of
probity".  Nor do they select out as the governing concept, the notion of
"dishonesty" which was the subject of exposition
in the <b>Brunei<i>
</i></b>case.  After considering the material which I have set out and a great
deal more which I have not set out, I have come to the conclusion
that the
acceptance of the first four <b>Baden</b> categories, even though they now have
no prominence in England, amounts really to no more than accepting a standard
of honesty appropriate
in the circumstances.  The reference in category (iv) to
"the facts" sufficiently indicates, in my view, that a person receiving,
for
his own use, trust property, whilst in the state of knowledge posited, would
not, relevantly, be acting honestly.  Translated
into terms of the present
case, if either of the defendants, at the time when they took the legacies,
knew of circumstances which
would reasonably indicate to them that the will was
invalid, that would be sufficient for the imposition of a constructive trust.
Spending of their legacies would be a breach of such trust.
<P>

43   	Against this background, I turn to consider the claim
against the third defendant, that she took her legacy subject to a constructive
trust in favour of the plaintiff.
<P>

<b>Was the third defendant subject to a constructive trust?</b>
<P>

44   	Counsel for the plaintiff submits that, when the third
defendant took her legacy, she had at least "knowledge of circumstances
which
would indicate the facts to an honest and reasonable (person)".  Reliance is
not placed upon the fifth category of knowledge
in <b>Baden</b>.  I should say,
perhaps, that I entertain considerable doubt whether knowledge of the kind
posited in the fifth category would, in
any event, be sufficient to base the
imposition of a constructive trust.  The question, therefore, is whether Ms
Hamilton, the third
defendant, was acting dishonestly when she accepted the
legacy, in that circumstances known to her would reasonably have indicated
to
her that the will was not the valid last will and testament of Mr Gertsch.  It
is necessary, therefore, to consider the evidence
in the case bearing upon her
state of mind at that time.
<P>

45   	It is clear from Ms Hamilton's evidence that she first met
Mr Gertsch in or about 1964 and that, from that time up to the
time of his
death, a close relationship developed between them.  The details of the
development of that friendship appear clearly
from her affidavit.  I accept her
evidence.  There is no need to set it out in detail in these reasons.  It is
clear that he confided
to her information as to his relationships with other
men and as to difficulties which emerged in those relationships; also problems
relating to his hairdressing business and the financing of it, and difficulties
in that regard with his half-brother, the plaintiff.
 She also discussed with
him her own problems, domestic and financial, to some of which I shall make
reference later.  She was aware
of the commencement of his relationship with
Roger Tesseydre.
<P>

46   	In 1988, Mr Gertsch told her that Roger had become very
ill and that he was going to close his hairdressing salon so that
he could
devote his time to caring for him.  Roger's health deteriorated fairly rapidly.
Mr Gertsch was very distressed about this
and was comforted by Ms Hamilton.
When Roger died at Easter 1990, Mr Gertsch increasingly came to Ms Hamilton for
emotional support.
 She would meet him approximately three times per week and
he would telephone her at least twice a day.  Mr Gertsch told her, shortly
after Roger's death, that he had inherited his estate.  He referred to it as
being "millions".
<P>

47   	Shortly after being told of this, she was also advised by
Mr Gertsch that he was receiving anonymous phone calls in relation
to the
inheritance, in which threats were made to his life.  He was concerned for his
safety.  There was discussion about increasing
the security of his home.  She
suggested that he seek help from the police.  Later, he told her that he had
done so.
<P>

48   	She knew that Brian Roberts was Mr Gertsch's solicitor and
was handling financial affairs relating to his inheritance from
Mr Tesseydre.
She was given to understand that there were administrative problems in relation
to Mr Tesseydre's "companies".  He
appeared to be somewhat concerned that Mr
Roberts was "dragging his feet" in relation to finalising matters relating to
those companies.
 It was during this period that Mr Gertsch made offers of
financial help to Ms Hamilton and gave her advice as to the organising
of her
work and financial affairs, the details of which I shall return to.  
<P>

49   	Ms Hamilton became aware that, at the end of May 1990, Mr
Gertsch commenced a relationship with Mr Esposito.  It was not a
settled
relationship.  They would break-up and then get back together again.  She
recalled being told of a problem which had arisen
between the two men in
August.  It involved Mr Roberts.  It appeared that Roberts had been displaying
some interest in Mr Esposito.
 He had bought a shirt and vest for him.  When Mr
Gertsch found out that this had occurred, it appeared that he became
jealous.
<P>

50   	Ms Hamilton was aware, however, that, notwithstanding this
rift between Mr Gertsch and Mr Esposito, Mr Gertsch continued to
see Mr
Esposito and was emotionally attached to him.  In late September, Mr Gertsch
spoke to her of an incident involving Mr Esposito
which had made Mr Gertsch
afraid of him.  He felt that on an occasion, very recently, when he was being
driven as a passenger in
Mr Esposito's car, a situation had developed in which
his life was being threatened.  He was terrified of Mr Esposito and was
proposing
to severe all ties with him, but slowly, so as not to anger him.  He
told Ms Hamilton that he was concerned about his safety and
that he intended to
change his will.  His words as she recalled them were:  "I've left him Roger's
house, the businesses.  But don't
worry I'm changing.  I must have been crazy.
I have my friends and there is Bradley.  You should all be getting more."  She
understood
this as a reference to changing a will in which he had left the
house and businesses to Esposito.  The reference to Bradley was,
she
understood, a reference to a nephew of Mr Gertsch.  She recalled that, in this
conversation, Mr Gertsch also told her that he
intended to find a new solicitor
to handle the will for him.  He did not want Brian Roberts to be involved in
his personal matters.
 He did not want him handling his personal affairs
because he was unhappy with his involvement with Esposito.  
<P>

51   	This was the only occasion on which Mr Gertsch discussed
with Ms Hamilton his intentions in relation to his will.  Shortly
afterwards,
on 20 October 1990, she was made aware that Mr Gertsch had disappeared from his
home.  Thereafter she was involved in
giving information to the police in
relation to the search for him.  After the discovery of Mr Gertsch's body on 12
November 1990,
she continued to assist the police.  I am satisfied that she was
not aware of the contents of the Will until late January 1991, when
she was
told by Mr Fidirikkos, in a conversation in his partner's home, that Brian
Roberts had obtained probate of the Will and that
she was a beneficiary.  It
was suggested that she get in touch with Detective McCann who was in charge of
the homicide investigation
and who would be able to give her the necessary
information.  She had spoken to the detective on a number of occasions
previously
and knew him.  She spoke to him the next day and was told that she
had been left $100,000 in the Will and that the detective would
tell Brian
Roberts to get in touch with her.  She said that when she received this
information she "burst into tears and was unable
to speak".  Half an hour later
Detective McCann brought to her a copy of the deceased's will dated 7 September
1990.
<P>

52   	In her affidavit, Ms Hamilton says that although she was
initially overcome emotionally at the news of her bequest, she was
not in any
doubt as to its genuineness, until December 1994.  On reading the Will she was
reminded of an earlier conversation with
Mr Gertsch in which he had indicated
that he was going to make sure that both Bradley and his mother would be
protected and also
of another occasion when Mr Gertsch had enquired of her how
much was outstanding on her mortgage.  She thought that the enquiry must
have
been made by Mr Gertsch so that he could determine how much he would leave
her.
<P>

53   	She was cross-examined as to her belief in the genuineness
of the Will.  It was clear that, either from a reading of the Will,
or through
what she was told by Detective McCann, she was aware that Roberts was executor
of the Will and also that "Vince Esposito
was the prime beneficiary".  She knew
that, if rumours as to the extent of the money inherited by Mr Gertsch from Mr
Tesseydre were
correct, that "Esposito would inherit from Mr Gertsch's estate
many millions of dollars."  The following passage then occurred in
her
cross-examination:
<P>

"Q.	Did you not consider it surprising knowing what you did or having been told
what you had been told by Mr Gertsch that this will
should appear leaving such
potentially large sums of money to Mr Esposito?
<P>

A.	Was I surprised?
<P>

Q.	Yes.
<P>

A.	I was desperately disappointed.
<P>

Q.	That is not quite an answer to my question.
<P>

A.	I was, I suppose I was surprised."
<P>

54   	Later the topic was returned to.  She was asked the
following questions and gave the following answers:
<P>

"Q.  When you came to understand that Mr Esposito was the, as you put it, the
prime beneficiary under this will?
<P>

A.	(Witness nodded).
<P>

Q.	I think you said earlier you were surprised?
<P>

A.	Not surprised, I think I was I was disappointed.
<P>

Q.	I think you did say that and then I pressed you and asked you if you were
surprised and I believe you agreed with me you were
surprised?
<P>

A.	I will have to insist that I was disappointed and not surprised.
<P>

Q.	Why?
<P>

A.	Because Luddy did not follow through and change the will." 
<P>

55   	She was also asked the following questions and gave the
following answers:
<P>

"Q.	It did not strike you as odd when you learnt Mr Roberts was representing Mr
Gertsch's estate that he was doing so pursuant to
a document dated 7 September
when there had been this apparent break-up in relation between Mr Gertsch and
Mr Roberts as early as
August?
<P>

A.	It did not strike me as at odds because he continued to see Vince Esposito
and as I recall he was on fairly friendlier terms
with Mr Roberts during that
period as well.
<P>

Q.	You said earlier it was his intention not to use Mr Roberts in relation to
his personal affairs?
<P>

A.	His intention not to use Mr Roberts in relation to his personal affairs on
that one specific night that is what Luddy had told
me.
<P>

Q.	You say it did not cause you any surprise when you learnt Mr Roberts was
representing his estate in early 1991?
<P>

A.	Not surprised.
<P>

Q.	You say you were disappointed but not surprised?
<P>

A.	Yes."
<P>

56   	Ms Hamilton also gave evidence that she did not learn that
the Will was a forgery until she received the letters sent at the
direction of
the court in 1994.  She had ceased to have contact with Mr Gertsch's friends,
from a period fairly shortly after his
death.  Consequently, any information
they may have received was not passed on to her.  Also, I am satisfied, she had
not seen some
newspaper reports which would have alerted her to the problems
with the Will, at an earlier date.
<P>

57   	I had the opportunity to observe Ms Hamilton when under
cross-examination.  I formed the view that she was a reliable witness
who was
seeking to tell the truth as she remembered it.  She understood the granting of
probate.  She had been informed by Detective
McCann that the will had been the
subject of probate.  Furthermore, no suggestion was made to her by the police
that there was any
doubt as to the genuineness of the Will.  I am satisfied
that, although she expected the Will might be changed after the conversation
she had had with the deceased, she nevertheless believed that the Will produced
to her by the police was genuine.  She was disappointed
that the deceased had
apparently not carried through with his stated intentions to alter it.
<P>

58   	In all these circumstances, I am quite satisfied that she
honestly believed on reasonable grounds that the Will was genuine
and that she
was entitled to the legacy she received under it.  Accordingly, there is no
basis for the imposition upon her of a constructive
trust in favour of the
plaintiff.
<P>

59   	There can be no doubt, however, that the moneys she
received under the Will were not paid to her as the result of a genuine
legacy.
They were moneys which should have passed on intestacy to the plaintiff.
Accordingly, he is prima facie entitled to recover
them, either through tracing
them as trust moneys in the manner already referred to, or by way of a common
law money count for money
had and received to his use.  To both these claims Ms
Hamilton has pleaded the change of position defence.  I turn then to consider
whether the defence has been made out, in whole or in part.
<P>

<b>Change of position</b>
<P>

60   	Since<b> </b>the decision of the High Court of Australia
in <b>David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 48</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175
CLR 353</a>, it is clear that the defence of "change of position" is available in
Australia.  In that case, restitution was sought of moneys
paid under mistake
resulting in the "unjust enrichment" of the recipient.  The majority (Mason CJ,
Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh
JJ) after considering the basis of a claim
for restitution resulting from unjust enrichment said (at 379-380):
<P>

"The fact that the payment has been caused by a mistake is sufficient to give
rise to a prima facie obligation on the part of the
respondent to make
restitution.  Before that prima facie liability is displaced, the respondent
must point to circumstances which
the law recognizes would make an order for
restitution unjust.   There can be no restitution in such circumstances because
the law
will not provide for recovery except when the enrichment is
<i>unjust</i>.  It follows that the recipient of a payment, which is sought to
be recovered on the ground of unjust enrichment, is entitled to
raise by way of
answer any matter or circumstance which shows that his or her receipt (or
retention) of the payment is not unjust.
<P>

     The two "defences" upon which the respondent relies in this Court are,
first, that the payments by the appellants were made
for good consideration
and, secondly, that in reliance upon receipt of the payments the respondent, in
good faith, changed its position
to its detriment.  In the context of a mistake
case, these "defences" were included in the well known formulation of Goff J.
in <i>Barclays Bank.  </i>His Lordship stated:
<P>

"(1)  If a person pays money to another under a mistake of fact which causes
him to make the payment, he is prima facie entitled
to recover it as money paid
under a mistake of fact.  (2)  His claim may however fail if (a) the payer
intends that the payee shall
have the money at all events, whether the fact be
true or false, or is deemed in law so to intend; or (b) the payment is made for
good consideration, in particular if the money is paid to discharge, and does
discharge, a debt owed to the payee (or a principal
on whose behalf he is
authorised to receive the payment) by the payer or by a third party by whom he
is authorised to discharge the
debt; or (c) the payee has changed his position
in good faith, or is deemed in law to have done so."
<P>

61   	Their Honours returned to the question (at 384-386) where,
after a consideration of Australian, English, Canadian and United
States
decisions, it was made clear that the defence should be accepted in this
country.  The point had not been argued in the court
below.  Accordingly, the
matter was remitted to the trial judge for further consideration on the facts.
In these circumstances, the
Court's comments were of a general nature.  Their
Honours said (at 385):
<P>

"...a defence of change of position is necessary to ensure that enrichment of
the recipient of the payment is prevented only in
circumstances where it would
be <i>unjust</i>."
<P>

62   	Their Honours noted that (at 385-386):
<P>

"... the defence of change of position is relevant to the enrichment of the
defendant precisely because its central element is that
the defendant has acted
to his or her detriment on the <i>faith of the receipt</i>.  In the
jurisdictions in which it has been accepted (Canada and the United States), the
defence operates in different ways but the
common element in all cases is the
requirement that the defendant point to expenditure or financial commitment
which can be ascribed
to the mistaken payment.  In Canada and in some United
States decisions, the defendant has been required to point to <i>specific</i>
expenditure being incurred because of the payment.  Other cases in the United
States allow a wider scope to the defence, such that
a defendant can rely upon
it even though he or she cannot precisely identify the expenditure caused by
the mistaken payments.  In
no jurisdiction, however, can a defendant resort to
the defence of change of position where he or she has simply spent the money
received on ordinary living expenses."
<P>

(Footnote citations omitted.)
<P>

63   	One of the cases specifically referred to by their Honours
and described as important was the decision of the House of Lords
in <b>Lipkin
Gorman v Karpnale Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%202%20AC%20548" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 2 AC 548.</a>  In that case a partner in a firm of
solicitors stole money from the firm's client account and used it to purchase
gambling chips
for the purpose of placing debts in a gambling club.  The firm
brought an action against the gambling club seeking to recover the
stolen
moneys.  It was held that an innocent recipient of stolen money was obliged to
pay an equivalent sum to the true owner where
he had not given full
consideration for it and had thus been unjustly enriched at the expense of the
true owner.  The club was found
to be such an innocent recipient but was
allowed to rely on the defence of change of position in relation to the amount
of winnings
that it had paid out to the solicitor.  Lord Goff of Chieveley,
after consideration of authority, said (at 579):
<P>

"In these circumstances, it is right that we should ask ourselves:  why do we
feel that it would be unjust to allow restitution
in cases such as these?  The
answer must be that, where an innocent defendant's position is so changed that
he will suffer an injustice
if called upon to repay or to repay in full, the
injustice of requiring him so to repay outweighs the injustice of denying the
plaintiff
restitution.  If the plaintiff pays money to the defendant under a
mistake of fact, and the defendant then, acting in good faith,
pays the money
or part of it to charity, it is unjust to require the defendant to make
restitution to the extent that he has so changed
his position.  Likewise, on
facts such as those in the present case, if a thief steals my money and pays it
to a third party who
gives it away to charity, that third party should have a
good defence to an action for money had and received.  In other words, bona
fide change of position should of itself be a good defence in such cases as
these.  The principle is widely recognised throughout
the common law world."
<P>

64   	After referring to examples of such recognition, his
Lordship continued (at 580):
<P>

"I am most anxious that, in recognising this defence to actions of restitution,
nothing should be said at this stage to inhibit
the development of the defence
on a case by case basis, in the usual way.  It is, of course, plain that the
defence is not open to
one who has changed his position in bad faith, as where
the defendant has paid away the money with knowledge of the facts entitling
the
plaintiff to restitution; and it is commonly accepted that the defence should
not be open to a wrongdoer.  These are matters
which can, in due course, be
considered in depth in cases where they arise for consideration."
<P>

65   	His Lordship also said (at 580):
<P>

"At present I do not wish to state the principle any less broadly than this:
that the defence is available to a person whose position
has so changed that it
would be inequitable in all the circumstances to require him to make
restitution, or alternatively to make
restitution in full.  I wish to stress
however that the mere fact that the defendant has spent the money, in whole or
in part, does
not of itself render it inequitable that he should be called upon
to repay, because the expenditure might in any event have been
incurred by him
in the ordinary course of things."
<P>

66   	Reference may also be made to the decision of the
Newfoundland Court of Appeal in <b>RBC Dominion Securities Inc v Dawson
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20111%20DLR%20%284th%29%20230" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 111 DLR (4th) 230.</a>  In that case, the court noted (at p238) that
"[t]he mere fact that the moneys were spent does not, by itself, furnish an
answer
to the claim for repayment" and that "[t]he clearest examples of change
of circumstances are those cases where the defendant has
spent the money and
has nothing to show for it:  the donation to charity which would not have
otherwise been made; the investment
in a business that has failed."  It was
noted that the onus was upon the defendant to establish the defence.  It was
said, however,
that "to require that a private individual who believes she was
spending her own money, prove her expenditures as if she were claiming
damages
in an action for negligence would be most unfair.  It was t\he plaintiff's
error that put her in the funds in the first place
and led her to believe the
funds were hers to spend without having to account to anyone for her
expenditures."  In such circumstances,
the court could be "satisfied with
reasonable estimation".  
<P>

67   	Has Ms Hamilton relevantly demonstrated a change of
position consequent upon the receipt by her of the legacy of $100,000?
 What I
have already said indicates that I accept that she received the money bona
fide, in circumstances where she could regard
it as her own, to be expended as
she thought fit.  Also, it has already been indicated in these reasons that she
expended the money
in particular ways.  It is submitted on behalf of the
plaintiff that very little of that expenditure, if any, attracts the defence.
In particular, the plaintiff asserts that the use of some $68,000 to discharge
her indebtedness on her mortgage cannot be regarded
as a relevant change of
circumstances to her detriment.  It is, however, argued on her behalf that, in
view of the apparent breadth
of the defence, it is inappropriate simply to view
individual expenditures in isolation.  It is necessary, so it is put, to
consider
the broad effect of the receipt of the legacy upon her lifestyle and
patterns of earning and expenditure.  It is submitted that changes
occurred in
this regard that were significant and far reaching and were such as to render
it inequitable that she should be called
upon to repay the legacy.  It may be
noted, also, that considerable reliance was placed upon the fact, which I
accept, that she did
not become aware of any doubts as to the validity of the
will until 1994 and was not called upon to make any repayment until 1996.
 
<P>

68   	In her affidavit and oral testimony, Ms Hamilton provides
considerable information as to her relationship with Mr Gertsch,
particularly
in the years close to his death and as to his influence upon her life and
financial affairs.  As I have already indicated,
the friendship commenced in
1964.  Over the years they saw each other socially on a regular basis, which,
by 1969, was approximately
once per fortnight.  Ms Hamilton describes the
relationship as it developed over the whole of the 26 year period in the
following
terms, which I accept:
<P>

"Luddie and I became very close and developed a relationship akin to that of
close siblings.  We were very comfortable in each other's
company and turned to
each other in times of need."
<P>

69   	Occasions of need on both sides are referred to in Ms
Hamilton's evidence.  I shall not refer to them in detail.  As already
noted,
she provided comfort to him when troubles arose in relation to the financing of
his hairdressing business and also in relation
to the death of his long time
partner, Paul.  Ms Hamilton married for a second time in July 1977.  There were
two children of the
marriage and for a period of time, because of obvious
domestic commitments, Ms Hamilton saw less of Mr Gertsch than previously,
although
the friendship continued.
<P>

70   	In 1986, Ms Hamilton's marriage ended in divorce.
Thereafter, contact with Mr Gertsch increased to the extent of their seeing
each other socially, fairly regularly.
<P>

71   	As a result of the family law property settlement, and
financial arrangements she made, she reached the situation at the end
of 1987
which she described as being, approximately, as follows: 
<P>

"(a)	Assets -
<P>

	A.	Property known as 20 Hart St, Balmain which had an approximate
<P>

		value of $350,000.00.
<P>

B.	Taxi with taxi plates, which had a combined value of approximately 
<P>

$170,000.00.
<P>

	C.	1984 Holden Commodore vehicle (bought around the time of 
<P>

separation) with an approximate value of $7,000.00.
<P>

	D.	Household furniture, furnishings and other contents (realisation value)
<P>

		approximately $3,000.00.
<P>

(b)	Liabilities -
<P>

	A.	Mortgage to Advance Bank in the sum of $100,000.00.
<P>

	B.	Overdraft to the National Australia Bank in the sum of $25,000.00.
<P>

	C.	Personal loan from the NAB at Cremorne $7,000.00 (used to buy 1984
<P>

		Holden Commodore).
<P>

(c)	Annual gross income of approximately $30-40,000.00.
<P>

(d)	Usual outgoings in the form of household expenses for myself and the 2 
<P>

children."
<P>

72   	She received no direct support from her ex-husband for the
maintenance of the two children, although he paid accounts from
time to time.
She was forced to work seven days a week administering the taxi business and
occasionally driving herself.  On occasion
she found it necessary to obtain
part time jobs to increase her finances.  
<P>

73   	It was during this period that the health of Mr Tesseydre
deteriorated rapidly and she provided Mr Gertsch with the comfort
and
assistance already described.  In late 1989, Ms Hamilton experienced financial
difficulties in relation to the taxi business.
 This resulted in her increasing
the mortgage and her overdraft with the National Australia Bank.  
<P>

74   	After the death of Mr Tesseydre in Easter 1990, as I have
said, her relationship with Mr Gertsch became very close.  Meetings
took place
about three times a week and he would telephone her at least twice a day.  
<P>

75   	In 1990, Ms Hamilton was in need of income and was
contemplating taking over the driving of the taxi herself.  She discussed
these
matters with Mr Gertsch who strongly advised her against driving the taxi
because of dangers associated with it.  He offered
to help her to obtain an
alternative source of income, through the performance of secretarial work.
<P>

76   	Mr Gertsch made quite specific proposals to Ms Hamilton.
He suggested that she sell the taxi and, from the proceeds, pay out
her
overdraft and reduce the size of her mortgage as much as possible.  This would
substantially reduce her weekly mortgage repayments.
 He also suggested that
she convert the ground floor of her home into a flat, which could then be let
at a reasonable rental.  He
offered to organise tradesmen, whom he knew, to do
the necessary renovations.  In addition, he suggested that she obtain income by
doing secretarial work for him and later expanding the secretarial business by
working for others.  She could conduct the business
at her home.  He said that
he would be in a position to send friends to her who required secretarial work
to be done for them.  He
further suggested that she "might even have time to
take up some study, you know, go to uni."  He also offered to lend her money
for the purchase of computer equipment necessary for the setting up of the
secretarial business.
<P>

77   	Ms Hamilton considered these proposals and decided to
follow them.  She accepted an extended loan of $5,000 from Mr Gertsch
with
which to purchase computer equipment.  She then accompanied him on a holiday to
Melbourne in which her travel expenses were
paid by Mr Gertsch.  Upon returning
from the holiday she sought out a purchaser for the taxi and taxi plates.  On
13 August 1990
she sold them for a price of $149,000.  The immediate result of
this was that she lost the opportunity of earning a potential gross
income of
approximately $60,000 per year which she would have earned had she followed
through her original plan of taking over the
driving of the taxi herself.  
<P>

78   	From the proceeds of sale Ms Hamilton repaid her loan to
Mr Gertsch of $5,000, paid out the amount of her overdraft in the
sum of
$22,946.48 and also paid $93,000 off the mortgage on her home reducing the
capital debt to approximately $68,000.  
<P>

79   	I accept her evidence that her position after payment of
her debts was as follows.  She owned a 1984 Holden Commodore vehicle;
she had
$15,766.65 in a National Australia Bank Cash Deposit Account; she owned the
computer equipment she had purchased and had
some household furniture and
furnishings; she owned her home subject to mortgage.  Her liabilities consisted
of the mortgage of $68,000,
an overdraft of $2,000 and a personal loan account
in the amount of $5,000 approximately.  Her outgoings consisted of mortgage
payments
of $240 per week and living expenses of approximately $250 per
week.
<P>

80   	As a result of the reorganisation of her financial affairs
she anticipated receiving income from the flat in the sum of $100
per week and
income from secretarial services to be supplied to Mr Gertsch in the sum of
$400 per week and additional income from
the provision of other secretarial
services in the sum of $100 per week.  These items of income could not be
achieved immediately
as the renovation work had to be finished.  In the
meantime she lived on the funds in her deposit account which, by October 1990
had reduced to approximately $10,000.  On 9 October 1990 she applied to
register a business name "Bayside Secretarial Service" and
opened a bank
account in that name.  Mr Gertsch asked her to defer commencing her business so
that the two of them could take a holiday
in Thailand.  Ms Hamilton was, at
first, reluctant to do this as she wished to start the secretarial business.
However, she agreed
and, in order to avoid becoming reliant on Mr Gertsch's
money, she made application for and received a sole parent's pension.  The
first payment of the pension was on 8 November 1990, which was subsequent to Mr
Gertsch's disappearance.
<P>

81   	During October 1990 as a result of Mr Gertsch's
encouragement Ms Hamilton applied to enter Macquarie University as a part-time
student for a Bachelor of Arts course.  Her application was successful.
Enrolment was not required until mid February 1991.  Her
intention was to enrol
for one subject each semester to begin with, perhaps increasing the number of
subjects if she had time available.
 
<P>

82   	This was the situation when on 20 October 1990 Ms Hamilton
received news that Mr Gertsch was missing.  By 12 November 1990
she was aware
that he was dead, after which she realised that she would have to find
full-time employment to replace the work that
was no longer available to her.
She still had available to her money from the sale of the taxi, and also the
social security payments
she was receiving.  She was in some fear for the
safety of herself and her children, as she thought that those who had been
responsible
for Mr Gertsch's violent death might consider that she, as a close
friend and confidante, had knowledge of the whereabouts of money
or valuables
which he might have secreted in his lifetime.  She abandoned, at that stage,
any thought of going to university.  She
took the children away on a summer
holiday, having decided not to leave them alone at that point in time.
Accordingly, she decided
not to seek employment until the end of the holidays
in January.  She hoped that she could obtain employment of one kind or another
similar to that in which she had engaged over the years and, at the same time,
seek to generate some secretarial work that could
be performed at home with the
use of the equipment that had been previously purchased.  
<P>

83   	On 4 February 1991 she received the cheque from Mr Roberts
for $100,000.00.  I am quite satisfied that the receipt of this
large sum of
money completely altered her financial outlook.  In her affidavit she speaks of
her reaction to the bequest and her
decisions as to its utilisation, in the
following terms:-
<P>

"Upon receipt of the bequest of $100,000, I believed that Luddie had made good
his promise to look after me financially.  I saw
a way of using the bequest
both to resolve my major financial problems and to allow me to explore the
opportunity of university study
in which I had long been interested.  I decided
to use the bulk of the bequest to pay off my mortgage which would relieve me of
a
monthly liability of $840.00, to pay off my other minor debts, and to revive
the idea of going to university.   I was then 44 years
old and apart from some
18 months after the birth of my oldest son, I had worked since the age of 14.
On assessing my position, I
considered the opportunity now offered to me was
one that realistically I would never have again, and which even if I did, could
be then too late to take real advantage of.  I thought, too, of Luddie's
encouragement and I thought that this was what he would
have wanted me to
do."
<P>

84   	I have already set out the manner in which the bequest was
expended.  Despite the psychological difficulties and behavioural
problems to
which Ms Hamilton made reference, she contrived to persevere with her
university course and in November 1991 completed
her first year at Macquarie
University as a part-time student.  She passed in two subjects in each of the
two semesters she attended
university.
<P>

85   	Her depressive problems returned in early 1992,
occasioning her withdrawal from university in April.  She sought psychiatric
help, including admission, as a voluntary patient, to the Northside Clinic for
a short period in July 1992.  Eventually, with the
continuation of psychiatric
assistance, improvement occurred and, by approximately February 1993, her
psychological state and behaviour
had returned to normal.  With this
improvement there occurred a corresponding improvement in her university
results, to the extent
that she decided to study full-time in 1994.  At the
commencement of 1993 she had chosen to follow an anthropology rather than a
psychology stream in her Bachelor of Arts studies, although she was aware that
a degree in psychology would result in better paid
work.  She was, however,
more interested in anthropology, although she knew that employment in this area
would be hard to find and
less remunerative.  In making this choice she relied
upon her financial position, resulting from the bequest.  By continuing her
studies full-time in 1995 she finished the degree course.  She fulfilled an
honours year in 1996, although suffering some distraction
from the commencement
of these proceedings.  In 1997 she enrolled for work towards the obtaining of a
PhD in anthropology.  This
work is continuing.  
<P>

86   	The first intimation that the bequest might be invalid was
contained in a letter from the plaintiff's then solicitors dated
19 December
1994.  After discussion of the matter with her own solicitor, a reply was sent
indicating that the bequest was accepted
in good faith and had been spent.
Finally, a letter of demand was received on 22 March 1996 after which the
present proceedings were
commenced.  
<P>

87   	Ms Hamilton has provided evidence, which I accept, as to
her financial position from the time of receipt of the bequest. 
From the
commencement of 1991 until November 1996 she had no paid employment.  Apart
from the expenditure, already referred to, of
the bequest moneys, she received
income as a result of a sole parent pension and family allowance, with a
student subsidy from 1993.
 When her sons attained the age of 16 she began to
receive, instead of the pension, an Austudy grant in a similar amount.  From
November
1991 she received rent from the flat in her home in the amount of $80
per week.  The rent has increased over the years being, $100
per week in July
1995, $140 per week in late 1996 and $170 per week from February 1998.
<P>

88   	In November 1996, in order to cover legal fees and the
additional needs of her sons she was obliged to take out a mortgage
of $35,000
over her home.  This is the maximum amount she has been able to borrow, a
request to increase the mortgage to $135,000
being refused.  Additionally, she
has lost an overdraft facility previously given to her by her bank.  Since
November 1996 she has
had some casual and part-time employment, and is
currently receiving approximately $330 per week gross in such employment.
Accordingly
she has a gross income of approximately $500 per week.  In addition
to the mortgage she has also a HECS debt of nearly $9,000.  She
also has the
following additional liabilities:  A debt to K. Hamilton for $8,000;
outstanding legal fees of nearly $17,000 and a
current credit card liability of
$1700.  
<P>

89   	It is plain that her income can, realistically, do no more
than provide minimum living expenses and service her current debts.
 Moreover,
as indicated by evidence in the case, the likelihood of her achieving, at least
in the short term, any reasonably substantial
income in the anthropology field
is slender.  
<P>

90   	In the result, it seems quite clear that the only way in
which Ms Hamilton could repay the bequest would be to sell her home
which she
currently values at $650,000.  An immediate detrimental effect would be the
loss to her of the flat which provides a significant
proportion of her income.
Also, after payment of the usual expenses associated with the sale and the
repayment of the bequest, mortgage,
interest and other outstanding liabilities,
Ms Hamilton would have a relatively small amount of capital to put towards the
acquisition
of alternative accommodation.  
<P>

91   	In all these circumstances, it is submitted on her behalf
that she has so changed her position in reliance upon the bequest
that it would
be inequitable to charge her home with the repayment of the whole or part of
it, by way of tracing and subrogation,
or to make an order that she pay the
amount of the bequest and interest to the plaintiff, on the basis that she has
been unjustly
enriched through its receipt.  
<P>

92   	Quite plainly, the defence of change of position, as
presently developed in the cases, does not admit of precise formulation.
 I
find it of little assistance to focus upon individual statements in the
judgments to the exclusion of the broad overarching concept
that restitution
will be ordered, in whole or in part, only where the defendant has been
<u>unjustly</u> enriched by the amount received.  Conversely, restitution is
not to be ordered where the circumstances would render it unjust to
do so.
Clearly the circumstances must always be looked at as a whole.  To say that,
for instance, it is no defence that the moneys
have been merely expended is to
fail, in my opinion, to distinguish between two situations:  one, where the
defendant, notwithstanding
the expenditure, can repay the amount expended from
other funds at his or her disposal, and the other, where the defendant has no
access to other funds and the requirement to repay would occasion great
financial hardship, even penury or perhaps bankruptcy.  Similarly
the
requirement that a defendant should have acted to his or her <u>detriment</u>
on the faith of the receipt will not always be easy to apply.  Is the concept
restricted to financial disadvantage or is it of wider
import?  Even if
restricted to financial matters, how is it to be determined?  Is the concept a
broad one, or should the Court undertake
the production of a form of profit and
loss account detailing advantages and disadvantages to the defendant accruing
from the receipt
and use of the money?  One matter does, however, appear to be
tolerably clear on the authorities.  The defence does not apply in
respect of
such moneys as have been expended on ordinary living expenses.  Such
expenditure would not, by its very nature, involve
any relevant change of
position.  In many cases, of course, where the moneys in question have been
mixed with other funds of the
recipient, it will be difficult to determine
whether any part of the money received has been used in the defraying of
ordinary living
expenses as it has merely augmented the pool of financial
resources available to the recipient, from which both ordinary and
extraordinary
expenditures are made.  However, in the present case, because of
the careful and candid analysis which has been made by Ms Hamilton,
this
problem has been reduced.
<P>

93   	If one puts to one side the amount paid to discharge the
mortgage on her home which, according to the evidence, includes the
amount of
$132 legal expenses, an amount, in round figures, of $30,000 remains.  Ms
Hamilton in her evidence, set out earlier in
these reasons, has provided an
analysis of the manner in which this amount was expended, together with
supporting information.  She
also provided further information in her oral
evidence.  As a result, counsel for the plaintiff made the submission that 40%
of the
expenditure should be attributed to ordinary living expenses.  I agree
that is useful to approach the question in percentage terms
but I consider this
is far too high a proportion.  In my view 12.5% is the appropriate measure.  In
the result, the plaintiff is
entitled to restitution of $3,750 from this
amount.  
<P>

94   	What of the balance?  The facts, which I have accepted,
indicate quite clearly that the utilisation of nearly $70,000 for
the payment
of the mortgage on her home, enabled Ms Hamilton to effect a radical change in
her life.  Putting it broadly, she gave
up paid employment and became a
university student, existing on the pensions and grants referred to, together
with rent from the
flat, which she had created in her home.  Undoubtedly she
has changed her position on the faith of the receipt.  Has she, however,
changed it to her detriment and, if so, to what extent?
<P>

95   	It is the plaintiff's case that Ms Hamilton has suffered
no relevant detriment from the receipt of the money.  She has had
the benefit
of using it for the repayment of the mortgage and of being, consequently,
relieved from her obligation to pay regular
instalments of principal and
interest.  In these circumstances, it is put that there is no demonstrated
detriment to her should she
now be required to repay the amount, the repayment
being secured by way of equitable charge upon her home.  I have already
indicated
that, in her present financial situation, she could not reasonably
deal with this new financial impost.  Even an order allowing for
repayment of
the whole sum by instalments, over a lengthy period of time, would, in my view,
occasion her considerable financial
hardship, having regard to her present
uncertain earning situation.
<P>

96   	I consider it reasonable to approach the determination of
this part of the case in a broad fashion by weighing up the advantages
and
disadvantages accruing to Ms Hamilton from the receipt of the moneys and
determining, thereby, whether she is in a position of
nett detriment or nett
advantage.  Such an approach is, in my opinion, reasonable in the circumstances
of this case.  It accords
roughly with the approach suggested by Lord Templeman
in <b>Lipkin Gorman (</b>at 560) where he considered the position of an
innocent donee of stolen money who expends the whole of it on the purchase of a
motor
car which he would not otherwise have been able to purchase.  He would
have altered his position on the faith of the gift and would
have been unjustly
enriched only to the extent of the second hand value of the motor car at the
time when restitution was sought.
 The amount originally innocently received,
was not, in the circumstances, the appropriate measure of the donee's unjust
enrichment.
 The relevant circumstances required a reduction of the amount.  By
parity of reasoning, a total extinction of the original amount
of unjust
enrichment could result, if, at the time of the claim for restitution, the
situation was such that the innocent recipient,
as a result of the receipt, was
suffering financial disadvantage which outweighed the advantage originally
bestowed by the receipt
itself.
<P>

97   	It is not an easy matter to weigh up the relevant
advantages and disadvantages in the present case.  Although there is a definite
continuity between the alterations that Ms Hamilton was in the process of
making in her life, as a result of the suggestions and
help of Mr Gertsch in
his lifetime, and the changes she made consequent upon her innocent receipt of
the supposed legacy from him,
I consider that I can properly have regard only
to the effect of the legacy upon her from the time she received it in January
1991.
 At that time she had already disposed of the taxi business and the
opportunity of earning from it sums in the vicinity of $60,000
per year gross.
She had already opted, at the time of his death, for an economic future based
upon the rental of her flat and the
development of a secretarial business
conducted from her home.  As this business was dependent for its commencement
upon the receipt
of work from Mr Gertsch himself, this necessarily was brought
to a halt by his death.  It is a matter of conjecture whether Ms Hamilton
would
have commenced it and based her future earnings upon it had she not, in January
1991, received the legacy.  However, I am satisfied
that having regard to the
fact that she had worked from a very early age and was a person of
intelligence, with a demonstrated earning
capacity, she would have found
appropriate employment.  Earnings from such employment would have been
necessary for the payment of
her mortgage and the ordinary living expenses for
herself and her children.  
<P>

98   	However, as a direct result of receipt of the legacy, she
forsook the exercise of her earning capacity.  By 1994 when the
first
indication of some doubts as to the validity of the legacy surfaced and,
certainly, by 1996 when the claim for restitution
was made, she had, in my
view, foregone in earnings, an amount considerably in excess of the amount of
the legacy, which by the end
of 1992 she had fully expended.  As against this,
she had, of course, qualified for the receipt of the pensions and grants paid
to
her as an unemployed student.  The evidence does not permit of any precise
calculations.  However, doing the best that I can, I have
formed the view that,
had she not received the legacy and, consequently, remained in employment
rather than pursuing a university
course, she would have, in all probability,
paid off a large part of the relatively small mortgage that remained after she
had made
the financial adjustments referred to during Mr Gertsch's lifetime.  I
think it reasonable to find that the mortgage debt would have
been reduced to
$10,000 by the time that restitution was claimed.  I consider that this sum
reasonably represents the amount of her
unjust enrichment from the use of the
legacy moneys for the payment of the mortgage debt.  Although the receipt of
the legacy has
resulted in her absence from the ordinary work force for a
lengthy period, I do not consider that any further adjustment is called
for.
She has been enabled to obtain a University degree which, at least in the long
term, would provide her with reasonable remuneration.
<P>

99   	Consequently, I find that, by receipt of the legacy, Ms
Hamilton has been unjustly enriched in the sum of $13,750 or, conversely,
she
has established the defence of change of position, pro tanto, to the extent of
$86,250.  Delay was not relied upon as a substantive
defence.  However, I
consider that, in all the circumstances, it would be unreasonable to require
that she pay interest on this amount
before restitution was demanded of her on
22 March 1996.  I award interest in accordance with the usual Supreme Court
Scales to the
plaintiff from that date until judgment.  The amount so awarded
is $5,076.50.  I also consider that this is an appropriate case to
depart from
the ordinary order for costs, in so far as the plaintiff has been, to a
significant extent, unsuccessful in his claim.
 I consider that Ms Hamilton
should pay one-third of the plaintiff's costs in relation to the claim against
her.  
<P>

100   	I have considered whether I should at this stage make an
order charging the amount of $13,692.00 upon Ms Hamilton's home.
 This is the
total of the award plus interest relating to the mortgage.  The doctrines of
tracing and subrogation would enable this
course to be taken.  However it is
possible that this may be rendered unnecessary by her making payment of the
amount ordered.  The
plaintiff's position is currently protected by the
existence of a caveat which remains in force until further order of the Court.
I think that it is sufficient, at this stage, that I grant to the plaintiff
liberty to apply on 7 days' notice to seek an order charging
the amount of
$13,692.00 upon the property, 20 Hart Street, Balmain, in the event of
non-payment of that amount to the plaintiff
within 28 days.  I also order that
upon payment of that amount to the plaintiff, the plaintiff take all necessary
steps to effect
withdrawal of the caveat.
<P>

101   	I turn then to the case against the second defendant, Mr
George Fidirikkos (Mr Fidirikkos).  
<P>

<b>Case against the second defendant</b>
<P>

Mr Fidirikkos received a legacy of $300,000 paid in two instalments of
$150,000.  These amounts are not capable of being traced
into any particular
assets.  Consequently the claim brought against Mr Fidirikkos is based only
upon the alternative claims that,
in the circumstances he was a constructive
trustee of the amount of the legacy in favour of the plaintiff, or that he was
unjustly
enriched by the receipt of it and should be ordered to make
restitution.  Mr Fidirikkos denies that he became a constructive trustee
and,
in relation to the second claim, asserts that he has not been unjustly enriched
as a result of the receipt of the legacy because
he changed his position to his
detriment upon the faith of its receipt.  I shall consider first the case based
upon the alleged constructive
trust.
<P>

102   	Mr Fidirikkos gave evidence by way of affidavit and oral
testimony.  I considered that he was a truthful, if somewhat confused
and
na&iuml;ve witness.
<P>

103   	I am satisfied that he was a close friend of Mr Gertsch.
He had met him more than twenty years prior to his death and was
in frequent
contact with him.  Mr Fidirikkos owns and conducts the business of a florist
shop.  Mr Gertsch would, on frequent occasions,
visit Mr Fidirikkos at the shop
and spend a considerable amount of time with him.  Mr Gertsch would confide in
him as to problems
that might occur in his relationships with his partners.  Mr
Fidirikkos was fully aware of his relationship with Mr Tesseydre and
that Mr
Tesseydre was contemplating leaving his entire estate to Mr Gertsch with the
result that "there will be a lot of jealous
people."  He was also aware that,
after Mr Tesseydre's death, Mr Gertsch complained of receiving threatening
phone calls.  He also
knew of the actions taken by Mr Gertsch to render secure
his home in Sutherland Street, Paddington.  Besides regular visits to the
shop,
Mr Gertsch would ring Mr Fidirikkos several times a day to tell him where he
was going and what time he would be home.  Even
when overseas, Mr Gertsch would
ring Mr Fidirikkos on a daily basis.  
<P>

104   	The close friendship between the two men led to Mr
Gertsch revealing to Mr Fidirikkos, on many occasions, his intentions
to change
his will.  Also, Mr Fidirikkos was led to believe that he would be a major
beneficiary in Mr Gertsch's estate.  
<P>

105   	After Mr Gertsch met Mr Esposito, he informed Mr
Fidirikkos that he had again changed his will and would leave Mr Esposito
part
of his estate.  Later he was told that, because of a falling out between Mr
Gertsch and Messrs Roberts and Esposito, that each
of them would be excluded
from the will.
<P>

<b>Constructive Trustee</b>
<P>

106   	The claim that Mr Fidirikkos became a constructive
trustee of his legacy is based upon his state of knowledge as to the position
between Messrs Gertsch, Esposito and Roberts, Mr Gertsch's testamentary
intentions in respect of Mr Esposito, and his attitude to
Mr Roberts as his
solicitor and as his executor.  It is asserted that, in this state of
knowledge, it was unconscionable of him to
have taken the legacy, with the
result that he became a constructive trustee of it in favour of the plaintiff.
The knowledge relied
upon relates to two periods, the first in August 1990, the
second in October.  The first concerns events involving Messrs Gertsch,
Roberts
and Esposito.  The second relates to conversations between Mr Gertsch and Mr
Fidirikkos, as to his testamentary intentions,
shortly before his
disappearance.  It is necessary to consider Mr Fidirikkos' evidence in relation
to these matters.
<P>

107   	Mr Fidirikkos' affidavit evidence presented some
difficulties, in that incidents referred to therein were not in chronological
order.  However, in the course of his oral testimony the following sequence of
events was established to my satisfaction.  Some time
in August 1990 Mr
Fidirikkos was made aware of a significant falling out between Mr Gertsch, Mr
Roberts and Mr Esposito.  This related
to the purchase by Mr Roberts of some
clothing as a gift for Mr Esposito.  I have already made reference to this.  It
is clear that
Mr Gertsch was very angry with both of them.  He appears to have
become, rightly or wrongly, very jealous and hurt.  Both Mr Gertsch
and Mr
Roberts spoke to Mr Fidirikkos about the situation.  Mr Roberts was concerned
that he would lose Mr Gertsch's legal business.
 Mr Gertsch told Mr. Fidirikkos
that his friendship with Mr Roberts was over and that the relationship between
them was purely one
of business, which would continue only because of Mr
Roberts' knowledge of the affairs of the Tesseydre estate and of problems
relating
to possible challenges to Mr Tesseydre's will.
<P>

108   	So far as Mr Gertsch's relationship with Mr Esposito was
concerned, this appeared to continue, but in a growing atmosphere
of mistrust.
About two weeks after the August incident, the further incident occurred, to
which reference has been made, when Mr
Gertsch felt that he had been put in a
position of significant danger by Mr Esposito whilst travelling with him in a
car in the Malabar
area.  It appears that this incident occurred late in
August.  It led to Mr Gertsch's seeking gradually to bring to an end his
relationship
with Mr Esposito.  Shortly after it occurred, Mr Gertsch told Mr
Fidirikkos about this incident and about his desire to terminate
the
relationship.
<P>

109   	Mr Fidirikkos was cross-examined as to the effect that
knowledge of these matters had had upon his view of the genuineness
of the
Will, dated 7 September 1990, in which Mr Roberts was appointed executor and Mr
Esposito was made the major beneficiary. 
It was put to him that, in these
circumstances, he could not have accepted that the Will was genuine.  The
following passages appear
in his cross-examination:
<P>

"Q.	And, of course, you were conscious, were you not, that he and Mr Gertsch
had had a rather public falling out in August of that
same year?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	Did it not cause you to doubt the authenticity of this document?
<P>

A.	No.
<P>

Q.	In all those circumstances?
<P>

	A.	No, I don't think so.
<P>

Q.	That Mr Roberts on 7 September 1990 was being appointed to be executor of Mr
Gertsch's estate?
<P>

A.	I suppose it is one point I missed.
<P>

	.............
<P>

Q.	Did it not at any time occur to you that Mr Roberts might have created this
document after Mr Gertsch's disappearance?
<P>

	A.	No.
<P>

	Q.	It never occurred to you?
<P>

A.	No.
<P>

Q.	It did not occur to you to be an extremely odd situation after the falling
out that he and Mr Gertsch had had that he should
be appointed the sole
executor of Mr Gertsch's will on 7 September 1990?
<P>

A.	I probably didn't notice the date, sir, and that might have brought the
light to me a little earlier but, no, I didn't notice
that date, sir.
<P>

............
<P>

Q.	If you had noticed that date, can I suggest to you that you would have been
very concerned that this document did not, to your
understanding, express what
you believed Mr Gertsch to have wanted to have done with his estate in the
early part of September 1990?
<P>

A.	1990?  September 1990?  No, it probably wouldn't have.  No, it definitely
wouldn't have 
<P>

	been.
<P>

Q.	In particular, by that date there had been not only a falling out between Mr
Gertsch and Mr Roberts but also a break up of the
relationship between  Mr
Gertsch and Mr Esposito?
<P>

	A.	Yes, sir.
<P>

	Q.	And do you say that at no time did you notice or look for or become aware
of the date 
<P>

that this document bears on its last page?
<P>

A.	No, I didn't look at that, to be quite honest.  I have never noticed
that.
<P>

	...........
<P>

Q.	May I suggest to you that you certainly by the end of 1990 were well aware
that this document bore the date 7 September 1990?
<P>

A.	No, I was not aware of that, sir.  I was aware of the document.  I wasn't
aware of that date.  Had I seen that date, I would
have definitely been able to
assist the police in a different way.  I tried everything with them.
<P>

Q.	And you say nobody from the police drew your attention to that date?
<P>

A.	I can't recall.  If it was drawn to my attention I'm sure I would have known
that that wasn't a correct will."
<P>

110   	Mr Fidirikkos was also cross-examined as to his alleged
failure to notice the date of the Will, even though it appeared,
quite clearly,
above the signatures of the attesting witnesses.  He maintained that he had
never noticed the date and had, consequently,
drawn no conclusions from it as
to the authenticity of the Will.  
<P>

111   	I observed Mr Fidirikkos very closely whilst he was
giving this evidence.  I formed the clear impression that he was telling
the
truth.  I am satisfied that he had previously failed to notice the date of the
Will or, if he had, that it did not impinge upon
his recollection as he had
failed to attribute any significance to it.  I felt that he was genuinely
surprised when his mind was
drawn to the apparently significant connection
between the date and the events which had occurred shortly before it.  He
realised
then, but not before, that there could be doubt as to the authenticity
of the document.  
<P>

112   	In addition to his testimony as to the information that
Mr Gertsch had imparted to him about his changing attitude to Mr
Esposito and
Mr Roberts, Mr Fidirikkos gave evidence of a further conversation with Mr
Gertsch.  This conversation took place a little
over a week before Mr Gertsch's
disappearance on 20 October 1990.  He agreed in cross-examination recalling
that Mr Gertsch had told
him that he had drawn up a new will, in which he had
removed any provision for Mr Esposito and in which Mr Fidirikkos had been named
as executor.  He also said that he had left to his nephew Bradley his house in
Sutherland Street, Paddington and also a sum of money
for his education.  His
housekeeper Tanya and Ms Hamilton were left amounts of money, as were the two
children of Mr Esposito.  Although
there was some confusion in his evidence, I
think it sufficiently clear that, although there were many conversations
between the
two men about the changing of Mr Gertsch's testamentary intentions,
this was the last conversation about a will, before his disappearance.
<P>

113   	Later when Mr Roberts showed him the Will, Mr Fidirikkos
became aware that it was not he but Mr Roberts who had been appointed
executor
and that Mr Esposito had been left the residue of the estate, which was
substantial.  Bradley had been left not the Sutherland
Street property but
another property at Regent Street, Redfern, subject to a life estate in favour
of Mr Gertsch's mother.  The contents
of the Will, therefore, were very much at
odds with the contents as described in the conversation.  I am satisfied that
Mr Fidirikkos'
immediate reaction to the document was to doubt that it was Mr
Gertsch's last will.
<P>

114   	Before Mr Roberts showed him the Will, Mr Fidirikkos had
become concerned about Mr Roberts.  He was suspicious that Mr Roberts
had been
involved in Mr Gertsch's disappearance.  These suspicions were founded upon
information given to him by others about Mr
Robert's appearance and behaviour
on the night of Mr Gertsch's disappearance.  Also, apparently, some conflict
had occurred between
accounts of the evening given by Mr Roberts on different
occasions.  There is no need to refer to the detail of these matters.  I
am
quite satisfied that Mr Fidirikkos was genuinely suspicious, voiced these
suspicions to the police, and generally assisted in
their investigations.
<P>

115   	There was a further ground for suspicion.  When Mr
Gertsch disappeared, a group of persons including Mr Fidirikkos and Mr
Roberts
went to Mr Gertsch's flat to search for any information that would assist in
determining his whereabouts.  Whilst they were
at the flat and were making
arrangements, with the assistance of others, to secure the premises, Mr Roberts
had said to Mr Fidirikkos:
 "You do as you wish because you are the executor to
his Will."  It is clear that this conversation took place at a point in time
reasonably close to Mr Roberts' bringing to Mr Fidirikkos the Will.  Mr
Fidirikkos stated in evidence that, when Mr Roberts told
him that he, Roberts,
was the executor of the Will, he thought that it was strange that Roberts was
the executor and he was not.
 He gave the following evidence:
<P>

"Q.	Well, then, did you ask him why there had been a change, or anything of
that kind?
<P>

	A.	I asked him - I asked him - I said to him:
<P>

"Is there not another will?"
<P>

		because I knew that Ludwig had taken Esposito out of that will.
<P>

	Q.	You asked Mr Roberts whether there was another will?	
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	What did he say?
<P>

	A.	He said to me:
<P>

"No, this is the last will".
<P>

Q.	Did you make any comment to him after that?
<P>

	A.	No, not really, because I already suspected him.
<P>

	Q.	You suspected him?
<P>

	A.	Yeah.
<P>

	Q.	What did you suspect him of?
<P>

A.	I thought that basically why that was still in there - I thought - it was
only my own feelings - that they had something to do
with the murder so that
they could possibly get the most of that estate, sir.
<P>

	Q.	Did you have any suspicions about the will itself?
<P>

	A.	None at all.
<P>

	Q.	None at all?
<P>

	A.	No. I thought it was one of but not the last one.
<P>

Q.	So, you suspected there had been another will and that was being kept from
you in some way?
<P>

	A.	Yes, sir."
<P>

116   	I should add that when he was shown the Will, Mr
Fidirikkos said to Mr Roberts that he had led him to believe that he was
executor and that Mr Roberts replied:
<P>

 "Well you were doing a good job...I've just sort of let you do it because in
previous Wills you were the executor, so I just thought
that I would let you
run with it for awhile."
<P>

Mr Fidirikkos said that he was "amazed" at this statement.
<P>

117   	Mr Fidirikkos said that he did not tell the plaintiff, Mr
Gertsch's brother, that, in his opinion, the Will was not the last
will.  He
did not know him.  He knew Mr Gertsch's mother.  He did not discuss the matter
with her, apparently because she was not
in a fit mental condition.  He did
discuss his concerns, however, with the police and with a number of Mr
Gertsch's friends.  He
did not institute any searches for another Will because
he had no way of doing so.  He asked Mr Roberts whether there was another
will
and was told that the Will was the last one made by Mr Gertsch.
<P>

118   	It is clear that Mr Fidirikkos remained suspicious of Mr
Roberts.  He was asked to maintain contact with him by the police
so that he
could provide them with information to assist in their enquiries.  The police
were also suspicious of Mr Roberts.  However,
the police did not doubt the Will
itself.  The investigating detective, Mr Bowditch, with whom Mr Fidirikkos
maintained contact,
told him that, as far as he was concerned, the Will was
genuine.  This is corroborated by the evidence of Mr Bowditch.  It was not
until the end of 1992 that the police formed the view that the Will was a
forgery.  By this time Mr Fidirikkos had expended the whole
of the legacy.
<P>

119   	Before Mr Roberts paid him the first instalment of
$150,000, Mr Fidirikkos was advised by him that probate of the Will had
been
granted.  This was early in January 1991.  The conversation must have occurred
in the period of time when Mr Fidirikkos was
aware of police suspicions about
Mr Roberts and while he was assisting them by supplying information about Mr
Robert's activities.
 Also he had told the police that he suspected there was a
later will.  However they had not found a later will and, obviously, had
not
opposed the grant of probate of the Will, as propounded by Mr. Roberts.
<P>

120   	It is the plaintiff's contention that when Mr Fidirikkos
received each instalment of his legacy from Mr Roberts, he did so,
in
circumstances where he became constructive trustee of the moneys for the
plaintiff.  The imposition of the trust was required
because Mr Fidirikkos did
not believe that the Will was the last will of Mr Gertsch.  It was a case of
"knowing receipt" of trust
moneys paid out by Mr Roberts in breach of trust.
Mr Fidirikkos, it was submitted, became a trustee because, relevantly, he had,
at least, "knowledge of circumstances which would indicate the facts to an
honest and reasonable man", being Category 4 knowledge
under the <b>Baden</b>
principle, as accepted in <b>Consul</b>.
<P>

121   	The case is not made any easier by the fact that Mr
Fidirikkos gave no express evidence as to his state of mind when the
legacies
were paid to him.  However, at least in the case of the first payment, early in
January 1991, it is reasonable to assume
that he retained his suspicions of Mr
Roberts.  He may well, also, have continued to suspect that there was a later
will.  However,
it must be remembered that such suspicions were based upon the
conversation he had had with Mr Gertsch shortly before his disappearance
in
October 1990.  He was not shown any document by Mr Gertsch, purporting to be
his new will or a copy of it.  Furthermore, as Mr
Fidirikkos said in his
evidence, Mr Gertsch very frequently spoke to Mr Fidirikkos of making changes
to his will.  The October conversation
was certainly not unique in this
respect.  Also, he had previously been shown copies of earlier wills of Mr
Gertsch, some in draft
form, some uncompleted, some executed and some not.  
<P>

122   	Moreover, he had clearly told the police about his
suspicions and the reasons for them.  He knew the police were making relevant
investigations.  In this context, he had been told by the investigating
detective that, in his view, the Will was genuine.  On top
of this, he was made
aware that the Will had been admitted to probate.  The evidence does not
establish what effect knowledge of
the grant of probate had upon Mr
Fidirikkos's view of the Will.  However, in my opinion, it is proper to have
regard to the fact
that he was not, in any way, legally trained and would, in
such circumstances, accept that a grant of probate indicated that a legally
established authority had accepted that the Will was genuine.  He was, thus, in
the position that, having voiced his suspicions,
he was aware that they had
been considered, investigated and not accepted.  In such circumstances was it
unreasonable and/or dishonest
on his part to accept the legacies?  I have come
to the conclusion that it was not.  
<P>

123   	Moreover, the relevant <b>Baden</b> principle speaks of
"knowledge of circumstances which would indicate the facts....".  The relevant
"facts" were those that would
indicate that the Will was a forgery.  No later
will has ever been found.  The invalidity of the Will did not arise from the
existence
of a later revoking testamentary instrument.  His suspicions as to
the existence of such an instrument are really beside the point.
 Indeed, if a
later will was a relevant "fact", it could not be said, in my view, that at the
time he took the legacies his mere
suspicions as to the existence of such a
testamentary instrument would amount to "knowledge of circumstances" within the
meaning
of the principle.  Even if there had been a later will I entertain
considerable doubt that, in the circumstances, Mr Fidirikkos would
have held
his legacy in trust for the beneficiaries under that will.  
<P>

124   	In <b>Muschinski v Dodds</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/78.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 78</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%2d1985%29%20160%20CLR%20583" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984-1985) 160 CLR 583</a>
Deane J (at 613-614) said of the constructive trust:
<P>

"The constructive trust shares, however.....some of the institutionalized
features of express and implied trust.  It demands the
staple ingredients of
those trusts:  subject-matter, trustee, beneficiary (or, conceivably, purpose),
and personal obligation attaching
to the property: cf. Sir Frederick Jordan,
<i>Chapters on Equity in New South Wales</i>, 6th ed. (1947: Stephen ed.), pp.
17-18.  When established or imposed, it is a relationship governed by a
coherent body of traditional
and statute law.  Viewed in its modern context,
the constructive trust can properly be described as a remedial institution
which
equity imposes regardless of actual or presumed agreement or intention
(and subsequently protects) to preclude the retention or assertion
of
beneficial ownership of property to the extent that such retention or assertion
would be contrary to equitable principle."
<P>

This authoritative statement must also be kept in mind, in determining whether
the circumstances of the case call for the imposition
of a constructive trust
upon Mr Fidirikkos.
<P>

125   	Here, it is asserted against Mr Fidirikkos that he acted
unconscionably in taking the legacies whilst believing that there
was a later
valid will.  If that belief were based upon a "knowledge of circumstances"
which would "indicate" that "fact" to him
as "an honest and reasonable man"
then, arguably, a trust could be imposed.  However, such a trust would require
a beneficiary as
one of its "staple ingredients".  Such a beneficiary would
necessarily be one entitled to take under the posited later will.  The
present
plaintiff would not be such a beneficiary; his entitlement arises under an
intestacy because the Will was invalidated not
by implied revocation but by its
being a forgery.  
<P>

126   	I can therefore, discern no basis for the imposition of
the constructive trust contended for.  Accordingly, I reject this
aspect of the
plaintiff's claim.  I turn therefore to the question whether Mr Fidirikkos can
successfully raise against the plaintiff's
claim for restitution, the defence
of change of position, in whole or in part. 
<P>

<b>Change of Position</b>
<P>

127   	As already indicated I am satisfied that when Mr
Fidirikkos took each instalment of his legacy, he did so believing the Will
to
be genuine.  Whatever suspicion he may have harboured as to there being a later
will, these had not be borne out by police enquiries,
notwithstanding the
assistance he had given.  Probate of the Will propounded by Mr Roberts had been
granted.  There was, apparently,
nothing further that he could do.  No
subsequent will has ever come to light.  I consider that, in all these
circumstances, Mr Fidirikkos
was entitled to receive the pecuniary legacy and
treat the money as his own.  Has he relevantly changed his position on the
faith
of that receipt?
<P>

128   	His evidence in this regard has been, rightly, criticised
as difficult and confused.  However, this is not enough to dispose
of the
defence.  So much is clear from authorities such as <b>Dawson</b>.  Mr
Fidirikkos is entitled to rely upon reasonable estimates of expenditure.  
<P>

129   	Prior to and since the receipt of the legacy, Mr
Fidirikkos has conducted a florist business in partnership with his wife,
from
whom he is separated.  From the accounting materials provided, including
relevant tax returns, it appears that the average nett
earnings of the
partnership were from $50,000 to $60,000 per annum, this amount being shared
equally between them.  It appears that,
from these earnings, Mr Fidirikkos paid
for his ordinary living expenses and provided assistance to his four daughters,
where possible.
 It is apparent that the receipt of the two amounts of
$150,000, the first on the 23 January 1991 and the second on the 15 November
1991 made a very significant difference to his financial situation.  He had
only the one bank account, a cheque account with the
Kings Cross Branch of
Westpac.  This account was used for the purpose of the business as well as his
private banking.  It appears
that money for the living expenses of himself and
his wife were drawn from this account at fairly regular intervals.  He had no
savings
account and did not operate any credit cards.  He also used cash from
the business for the purposes of himself and his wife.  This
cash did not go
through the bank account but was, he says, otherwise recorded in the books of
the business.  The two cheques making
up the legacy were banked into the
account and were expended through it.  The first cheque was fully spent by the
end of October
1991, by which time the account was in overdraft.  The second
cheque was banked on 13 November 1991 at which time the account was
overdrawn
by nearly $2,000.  The full amount of this cheque was spent by November 1992.
Consistently with his belief that the money
was his, Mr Fidirikkos did not keep
any account of how it was expended.  By consideration of his accounting,
banking and taxation
records, coupled with his recollection of types of
expenditure undertaken as a result of the substantial increase in his funds, he
has sought to put before the Court a picture of the way in which the legacies
were disbursed.  
<P>

130   	Mr Fidirikkos produced in evidence a number of Schedules.
They form Exhibit 2A.  The first, Schedule A, was simply a sequential
list of
all his expenses obtained from the cheque butts relating to his bank account.
Schedule B consists of taxation returns which
I have not found of particular
assistance.  Schedule C is headed "Venture at `The Rocks'".  This relates to a
florist store set up
from April 1992 to September 1992 flower selling at
week-ends, as an adjunct to the florist business.  It traded at a loss.
Schedule
D is headed "Business Expansion".  It relates to an attempt to change
and increase the business of the florist shop by the introduction
of new exotic
stock.  It also resulted in a loss.  Schedule E relates to entertainment
expenses incurred as a result of the influx
of funds.  Schedule F is of no
consequence.  Schedule G relates to expenditure on the weddings of his two
daughters, Selena and Parisa.
 There is a fairly large degree of estimation
involved in these Schedules apart from the reference to cheque butt entries in
Schedule
A.  I should add that Schedule A also includes two pages of extracted
cheque butt entries relating to expenditures which, it is alleged,
were
undertaken only as a result of receipt of legacies.  
<P>

131   	It is convenient to make reference, in the first
instance, to items of expenditure selected from the cheque butt entries
and
forming part of Schedule A.  It appears that this part of Schedule A is the
same as Annexure A to the affidavit of Mr Fidirikkos
dated 7 May 1999.  It
appears that the information is intended to illustrate the statement in his
affidavit that "I made substantial
changes to my personal and financial affairs
which I would not have undertaken if I had not received the legacy from the
Estate."
 I shall refer to the material as "Annexure A".
<P>

132   	It is apparent from a consideration of the items in
Annexure A that they relate to a number of topics, which have been made
the
subject of the separate Schedules in Exhibit 2A.  There is apparent
duplication, such as the many references to "wedding" in
the annexure which,
clearly, refer in part 1 to expenses which are also referred to in Schedule E
under the heading "weddings." 
Similarly, reference to "rent/markets" in the
Annexure, in amounts of $1,680 and $560, are clearly duplicated in Schedule C,
"Venture
at the Rocks".  Undoubtedly, the Court could have received more
assistance from Mr Fidirikkos, by a more careful and systematic presentation
of
expenditure relating to the various headings.  However, it is not unusual for a
Court to be confronted with such a difficulty.
 It must do the best that it can
in the circumstances.  
<P>

133   	Apart from items which may be the subject of duplication
in other schedules, there are a number of entries in Annexure A
which, quite
clearly, having regard to his pre-legacy earning level, could have been
acquired by Mr Fidirikkos only as a result of
the bequests.  An example is the
purchase of a Mercedes vehicle for his personal use at a price of $27,000.
Associated with this
purchase was a substantial insurance premium which,
unfortunately, was not renewed before the vehicle was stolen and not recovered.
Also included is a sum of $20,000 expended on the purchase of a car for his
wife Thea and two sums of $5,000 for the purchase of
cars for his son Stefan.
He also made significant gifts of money to his wife which are recorded in the
schedule.  Also drawings for
"self" are, obviously far in excess of drawings
that would have been made for personal use from the business account prior to
the
introduction of the legacy sums.  Also I gather from his evidence that he
resorted to unbanked cash for personal use.  This, in my
view, tends to
corroborate his claim that the drawings for "self" are predominantly, if not
entirely, attributable to the legacy.
 
<P>

134   	Mr Fidirikkos was cross-examined about items in Annexure
A.  For instance, it was put to him that amounts for security doors
totalling
nearly $1,500 were not attributable to the legacy.  However, I am satisfied
from his answers that this expenditure would
not have been undertaken if the
legacy money had not been available.  It would have been beyond his ordinary
means.  After some hesitation,
I have decided to accept the total amount of the
items in Annexure A as being attributable to the legacy.  They total, in round
figures,
$130,250.  
<P>

135   	In paragraph 69 of his affidavit of 7 May 1999 Mr
Fidirikkos refers to substantial expenditure made by him upon the house
of his
partner, Ms Oskerko.  This was a house in which he resided.  The amounts
itemised in the paragraph include, in addition to
amounts spent on the house
and its furnishings, an amount for dentistry capping work for Ms Oskerko and
the purchase of personal
apparel for her and for himself.  The amounts so spent
are claimed to be in addition to amounts referred to in the Schedule.  No
cross-examination was directed to these amounts.  I am prepared to accept them.
They total, in round figures, $27,000.
<P>

136   	Schedule B in Exhibit 2A consists, as I have indicated,
of copy tax returns.  I can derive no assistance from the detail
of these
documents, nor has any been offered.  Their main significance derives from the
evidence of Mr Tompsett, Mr Fidirikkos's
accountant, who testified that the
returns showed a decline in profitability of the florist business in 1992, due
to the costs of
sales increasing at a greater rate than the sales income for
the year.  This supports Mr Fidirikkos's contention that he utilised
legacy
money in an endeavour to change the nature and profitability of the florist
business in that year of income, by the purchase
of exotic lines, which he
would not otherwise have dealt in.  This new approach failed and resulted in
loss which is referred to
in a later schedule.  
<P>

137   	Schedule C deals with the expansion of the florist
business into week-end trading at the Rocks venue, to which reference
has
already been made.  I am prepared to accept Mr Fidirikkos's evidence that he
entered into this associated venture because the
legacy had provided the
necessary capital.  I am also prepared to accept that after conducting the
venture for approximately five
months in 1992, he abandoned it because it was
proving a failure.  There is a difficulty in that Schedule C provides some
information
as to expenditure on rent, which is already included in Annexure A.
I accept that Mr Fidirikkos made purchases by cheque of various
floral and
plant items, which are not included in the expenditure referred to in Annexure
A.  However, there is no attempt made to
provide evidence as to the income
achieved in this venture, with the result that it is not possible to quantify
the loss, although
I am prepared to accept that there was one.  It appears that
no separate books were kept and that accounting for this part of the
business
was simply incorporated into the accounts for the business as a whole.  
<P>

138   	The business losses claim to be attributable to
misapplication of part of the legacy money is to be found in Schedule D and
in
oral evidence in relation to the topic.  I am prepared to accept that Mr
Fidirikkos sought to upgrade the florist business, not
only by including the
venue at the Rocks, but also by buying in "more exotic and higher grade and
more expensive flowers."  It is
clear that this stock was far more expensive
than the stock ordinarily provided in the shop.  It did not sell well.  The
unsold stock
had to be dumped each week.  I am also satisfied that, due to lack
of business acumen and the state of financial confusion that appears
to have
resulted from Mr Fidirikkos's intermingling of the legacy money with his
business and personal money, the extended trading
of the shop, although being
conducted at a loss, was allowed to continue from early 1991 to late 1992.  It
was brought to a stop,
apparently, only by the exhaustion of the legacy and the
return of the bank account to its condition before the legacy instalments
were
received.  I am satisfied that the purchase of unprofitable stock, which would
not otherwise have been purchased, played a significant
part in the exhaustion
of the legacy.  The evidence satisfies me that, by no means infrequently, stock
which had cost, on average,
$250 per week was left unsold and was dumped.  I am
satisfied that $25,000 from the legacy was lost in this way.  Moreover,
although
losses from the Rocks venture have not been quantified, I am satisfied
that losses did occur.  In the circumstances, I think it reasonable
to allow a
further $5,000, with the result that I find that $30,000 of the legacy money
was used in business ventures, which would
not otherwise have been undertaken
and was simply lost.
<P>

139   	Schedule E relates to entertainment and like expenses.
The evidence makes it plain that the sudden influx of spending money
enabled Mr
Fidirikkos to increase his ordinary standard of living well beyond what he
could previously have enjoyed.  I am satisfied
that he is, by nature, generous
and spent a great deal of money upon entertaining his friends as well as by
increasing his own personal
levels of expenditure.  There is a difficulty, of
course, in determining whether amounts claimed in his very general evidence on
this topic are duplicated in the drawings to "self" referred to in the analysis
of cheque butts in Annexure A.  It may be that there
is some duplication.
However, I am satisfied that, to a significant extent, Mr Fidirikkos utilised
cash drawings from the business,
which became available to him because the
introduction of the legacies into the business bank account thus released to
him for personal
expenditure far more of the cash takings than had been
possible previously.  I am prepared to accept that Mr Fidirikkos spent a great
deal of the legacy money in this way.  The difficulty is that the vagueness of
his evidence presents considerable problems in quantification.
 
<P>

140   	It is clear that he quite frequently took friends out to
dinner as his guests.  Also, he dined out, himself, far more often
than he had
previously, as he says, "up to four times per week."  He also hired boats for
fishing trips, sometimes at a cost of $250
per day, which was far beyond his
previous means.  He also spent money on week-ends away "once or twice per
month" at an expenditure
of approximately $150 per trip.  Mr Fidirikkos
estimated that he "regularly spent in the region of $200 to $400 per week on
meals
and entertainment."  He also made gifts to his family which would
otherwise have been beyond his means.  Whilst accepting that it
is possible
that, over the two year period, he may well have spent more on such items, I
consider it reasonable to accept that he
expended from the legacy moneys an
amount of $40,000 over and above what he would ordinarily have spent.  
<P>

141   	Mr Fidirikkos, finally claimed he spent money on his
daughters' weddings well in excess of what he would have been able to
spend had
he not received the legacy.  These amounts are claimed in Schedule G.  There is
a difficulty as to possible overlapping
between amounts claimed in respect of
weddings in Annexure A.  Additionally, of course, it must be accepted that Mr
Fidirikkos would
have pushed his previous restricted means to their limit to
provide his daughters with weddings, which he would have regarded as
suitable.
A considerable sum of money is claimed in Schedule G.  I think it reasonable to
allow no more than the amount of $12,750
in order to allow for the factors that
I have mentioned.  
<P>

142   	In the result I am satisfied by the evidence that in
relation to the amount of $300,000 received by Mr Fidirikkos he has
relevantly
changed his position through the expenditure of $240,000.  I am conscious that
he may well have expended the entire amount
of $300,000 in ways that could
properly be characterised as other than ordinary living expenses.  However,
having regard to the onus
that he bears, the evidence, in my opinion, does not
permit me to make such a finding.  The result is that I find that he has been
unjustly enriched to the extent of $60,000 and must make restitution in this
sum.  He must pay interest on this amount, in accordance
with the Supreme Court
Scales, from the time of the making of demand upon him.  The amount of interest
so calculated to date of this
judgment is $22,152.00.  The total payable is,
therefore $82,152.00.
<P>

143   	For the same reasons, as in the case of Ms Hamilton, I
consider that Mr Fidirikkos should pay one-third of the plaintiff's
costs in
respect of the claim against him.
<P>

144   	I therefore order:-
<P>

A.	In respect of the plaintiff's claim against the second defendant
<P>

	1.	That the second defendant pay to the plaintiff the sum of $82,152.00.
<P>

	2.	That the second defendant pay to the plaintiff one-third of the costs of
his 
<P>

		claim against the second defendant.
<P>

B.	In respect of the plaintiff's claim against the third defendant
<P>

	1.	That the third defendant pay to the plaintiff the sum of $18,826.50.
<P>

	2.	That the third defendant pay to the plaintiff one-third of the costs of his

<P>

		claim against the third defendant.
<P>

	3.	That the plaintiff have liberty to apply on 7 days notice for an order 
<P>

		charging the property 20 Hart Street, Balmain with the repayment of 
<P>

		$13,692.00 in the event of the third defendant not paying the same to
<P>

		the plaintiff within 28 days from today.
<P>

	4.	That the plaintiff upon the payment of the said sum of $13,692.00 do all
<P>

		things necessary to effect the withdrawal of the caveat currently 
<P>

		registered against the property 20 Hart Street, Balmain.
