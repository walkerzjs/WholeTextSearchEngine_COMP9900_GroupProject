<b>1757/97 GAIL CHRISTINE HILL v  MELVYN COPELAND &amp; MICHELLE KAY
VRANDICH</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER MACREADY:</b>  This matter was listed before me
for hearing on 3, 4, 7 and 8 June 1999.  When the matter was called on for
hearing on 3 June 1999
the plaintiff made an application for leave to
discontinue the proceedings.  In addition the plaintiff sought as terms of the
leave
to discontinue orders that the second defendant pay the plaintiff's and
the first defendant's costs on an indemnity basis.  It was
made clear during
the course of the application for leave to discontinue that the making of the
orders as sought by the plaintiff
was not a condition precedent to her desire
to discontinue.  The second defendant seeks orders that the plaintiff pay her
costs and
the first defendant, the Executor of the estate of the deceased seeks
an order that his costs be payable out of the estate of the
deceased on an
indemnity basis.  Alternatively, the first defendant seeks that the plaintiff
pays his costs.
<P>

2   	The proceedings are brought by the plaintiff who is a
daughter of the deceased and the first defendant is the Executor of the
will.
The first defendant was a friend of the deceased having known him for some
years through work and other associations.  The
second defendant is the other
daughter of the deceased.  The deceased died on 20 September 1995 and under his
will of 12 October
1993 he gave his daughter, the second defendant, his
property at 115 Woodland Street, Balgowlah.  He made some minor specific
legacies
of some personal property and a legacy of $50,000 to be paid out of a
specific account to the plaintiff.  At the date of his death
that account had
no money in it and, accordingly, the gift to the plaintiff failed.  When the
deceased died the property at 115 Woodland
Street, Balgowlah was valued for
probate at $330,000.  The parties are agreed that its present value is
$460,000.  There was a quantity
of furniture, watches and jewellery most of
which was subject to specific bequests valued at $16,150.  Other monies in bank
accounts
amounted to a little over $7,000, there was a car for $13,100 which
also passed to the second defendant under the will.  It can be
seen that the
estate was substantially comprised of the property at Woodland Street,
Balgowlah which passed to the second defendant.
 
<P>

3   	The deceased was born in 1923 and his wife Fay Duncan was
born on 15 October 1928.  They married on 9 November 1946 and from
all accounts
their marriage was not a happy one.  By 1972 there were proceedings between
them for divorce and ultimately in 1976
proceedings were heard and a decree
nisi pronounced on the grounds that the marriage had broken down irretrievably.
The previous
years before that were difficult ones for the children.  It is
clear that the break up of the marriage had a severe impact, not only
upon the
deceased and his wife, but also on the children.  The deceased's wife is still
alive but she makes no claim in these proceedings.
 
<P>

4   	The plaintiff's claim for costs against the second
defendant is based upon the proposition that the plaintiff had a reasonable
case for provision when she commenced the proceedings given her effective total
omission from the will.  She knew her sister's situation
and believed that
there was some prospect for an order being made in her favour.  Evidence
emerged shortly before the matter was
due for hearing, that the second
defendant not only had the property transferred to her but that she had some
years before mortgaged
it in order to support borrowings by an acquaintance who
was running a fashion business.  Those borrowings were increased with the
consent of the second defendant and the term extended to September 1999.  It
was also disclosed in the affidavit of 24 May 1999 that
recently the borrower's
business had failed, she was having difficulty meeting the interest payments
and would not be able to pay
back the loan for some time.  Hence the property
in the second defendant's name was effectively worth considerably less than its
agreed value of $460,000 because of the loan outstanding of $230,000.  The
plaintiff submits that there was a deliberate withholding
of this information
such that the plaintiff was ambushed at the last minute and was hence forced,
on a consideration of that material
and the costs of her being involved to that
date, to seek leave to discontinue.  
<P>

5   	In order to evaluate this claim it is necessary once again
to go into some history following the death of the deceased and
following the
commencement of proceedings.
<P>

6   	As I have mentioned the deceased died on 20 September 1995
and probate was granted 22 March 1996.  A month earlier on 22 January
1996 the
solicitors for the plaintiff had written to the solicitors for the Executor
indicating that they had instructions to make
a claim under the Act and sought
some information in the hope that the matter could be finalised without resort
to litigation.  By
21 March 1996 the plaintiff's solicitors were supplied by
the 1st defendant's solicitors with copies of the application for probate
giving details of the estate.  On 26 April 1996 the plaintiff's solicitors
wrote seeking confirmation that there would be no distribution
of assets to the
beneficiaries and in particular that the real estate be not transferred to any
other person other than the Executor
pending the clarification of the
plaintiff's future claim.  That letter was forwarded to the Executor probably
on or before 2 May
1996.  It is thus perfectly clear that the Executor, the 1st
defendant, knew of the request not to transfer the property to the beneficiary.
The usual notice of claims was published on 6 April 1996 and required
particulars of claims to be given within one month.  Clearly
this was done in
this case.  On 12 June the 1st defendant's solicitors indicated that they had
still not received instructions from
the Executor but indicated that they had
themselves received no instructions to transfer the property.  
<P>

7   	On 30 July 1996 the solicitors for the 1st defendant wrote
to the plaintiff's solicitor and advised that their instructions
had been
terminated as from that date.  The Executor on his own initiative had signed a
transmission application on 24 July 1996
whereby the property was transferred
to the 2nd defendant.  Apart from communications between solicitors there were
discussions between
the plaintiff and the 2nd defendant during 1995.  According
to the plaintiff the 2nd defendant initially denied knowing about the
gift to
her, this being in December 1995.  At the start of July 1996 there was a
further conversation when the plaintiff sought to
discuss the matter with the
2nd defendant to avoid legal action.  The 2nd defendant hung up the phone.  On
11 August 1996 there were
further calls in which the 2nd defendant refused to
discuss the matter and again on 22 August 1996 when the 2nd defendant told the
plaintiff not to ring her again.
<P>

8   	Given the termination of instructions the plaintiff's
solicitor wrote direct to the Executor on 14 August 1996 again requiring
that
there be no distribution and seeking confirmation from him.  The Executor in
correspondence claimed he had discharge his final
duties as Executor two days
before he received that letter and enclosed a copy of the letter which he wrote
to the plaintiff on 15
August 1996.  In that letter he sent a watch which under
the will was given to the plaintiff's son, Duncan, and advised that the
property at Woodland Street had been transferred to the 2nd defendant some week
earlier.  He also took the opportunity of enclosing
a letter from the deceased
and a statutory declaration from someone who may well be a witness indicating
the deceased's strong desire
that the plaintiff have nothing out of the estate.
The plaintiff's solicitors wrote to the Executor challenging him on this matter
to which the Executor replied that he had discharged his duties to the late Mr
Duncan's wishes "to the letter".  
<P>

9   	On 21 September 1996 the second defendant mortgaged the
property for a loan of $190,000.  Her signature to that mortgage was
witnessed
by the solicitor who has acted for her in these proceedings, Mr Muriniti.  On
21 January 1997 she increased the amount
of the mortgage from $190,000 to
$230,000 and on 23 October 1998 the term was extended to 30 September 1999.

<P>

10   	The plaintiff knew, of course, that her sister was
residing in the property and in August she became aware of he transfer
of the
property to her.  There was no suggestion that the plaintiff's solicitors had
any knowledge of the mortgaging of the property
by the 2nd defendant until
April 1999.
<P>

11   	No application was made by the plaintiff to restrain any
dealings with the land by the 2nd defendant no doubt because there
was nothing
that she knew which would indicate the likelihood of disposal or encumbering.
The plaintiff commenced her proceedings
on 19 March 1997, naming the 1st
defendant as the only defendant and sought an order for provision under s7.
That day was the last
day or the last day but one for commencing the
proceedings.  The affidavit of the Executor of 3 June 1999 was served at about
that
time and that plainly set out that there had been a distribution of the
estate.  That prompted the plaintiff's solicitors to file
an amended Summons on
25 June 1997 adding the 2nd defendant as a defendant seeking an order that the
premises at Woodland Street
be designated as notional estate.  No doubt this
should have been done when the proceedings were first commenced.  There was a
further
amended Summons filed on 11 September 1998 in which the plaintiff, as a
matter of precaution also sought an order under s16(2) extending
time so far as
it related to the application against the 2nd defendant.  The plaintiff
certainly did not concede that it needed that
order and it seems somewhat
doubtful whether she would need such an order.  However, that amendment was
merely made by way of precaution.
 
<P>

12   	One thus has a situation where the property had been
mortgaged without the knowledge of the plaintiff or her solicitor.  Later
I
will deal with the question of whether it may have been prudent before
commencing proceedings to have searched the title to the
property at that
stage.
<P>

13   	However, the 2nd defendant did become a party to the
proceedings in June 1997 and the progress of the proceedings thereafter
is
something which the plaintiff relies upon as indicating the an intention on the
part of the 2nd defendant to deceive the plaintiff
about the 2nd defendant's
financial situation.  To put it bluntly, the 2nd defendant was on numerous
occasions in breach of orders
to file her evidence.  Eventually her evidence
only became available during early 1999.
<P>

14   	I turn to some more of the history.  The first order for
the 2nd defendant to file and serve her affidavit was made on 4 December
1997
on an occasion when she did not attend the directions hearing of which she had
notice.  She was directed to file and serve her
affidavits by 19 December 1997.
She failed to do.  The subsequent history is set out in a brief fashion in my
judgment of 5 March
1999 in this matter.  That judgment was given on an
application by the 2nd defendant for leave to file three affidavits because by
that stage although a year or more had passed she had not filed any evidence in
the case and the Registrar had ordered that she could
not file any further
affidavits without the leave of the Court.  I will not repeat that history as
this is set out in that judgment.
 In the result I allowed three affidavits
which were then suggested by the 2nd defendant as necessary for her case to be
filed and
made other appropriate interlocutory orders.  The matter had in fact
been listed for hearing on 20 April and there were other appearances
before me
for directions before that date.  One was 16 April in which I gave directions
and gave leave to the defendant to serve
some further affidavits and made other
directions.  
<P>

15   	On 20 April the hearing date was vacated and I fixed 3, 4
and 8 June for the hearing and 21 May for directions.  I also made
an order in
terms of the usual directions in these matters requiring the affidavits as to
costs to be served by 19 May 1999.  On
21 May 1999 I made orders for the
plaintiff to file affidavits in reply by 27 May 1999 which was the date for
return of subpoenas
and fixed an additional day for the hearing.  It was on 21
May 1999 that the first mention was made in court by the 2nd defendant
of the
fact that the 2nd defendant's property had been mortgaged.  An affidavit
setting this out was sworn by the 2nd defendant on
24 May 1999.  The solicitor
for the plaintiff subpoenaed the mortgagee and inspected the appropriate files
on 28 May 1999 to verify
the information that the plaintiff had provided in her
affidavit.  However, the fact that the property was mortgaged became apparent
to the plaintiff a few days after 12 April 1999.  She had received a copy of a
valuation of the property from Mr Fawcett, a valuer,
to which was annexed a
title search showing the mortgage.  Her solicitor had also received that
valuation but had not noticed the
mortgage.  The plaintiff was concerned and
raised the matter with her solicitor who then discussed it with counsel.  I
will come
back to what significance was attached to the mortgage by the
solicitor and the then counsel for the plaintiff.
<P>

16   	One other matter of note in the preparation of the case
was the service of a offer of compromise on 27 April.  In that offer
the 2nd
defendant offered to compromise on the basis that the 2nd defendant pay the
plaintiff $50,000 with the plaintiff and the
2nd defendant paying their own
costs.  It did not address the costs of the 1st defendant.  
<P>

17   	Above I have referred to affidavits as to costs.  These
are normally required in these matters both for the benefit of the
clients and
for the Court.  Frequently the Court has to take into account the effect of
costs on the distributable estate.  In the
present matter the affidavits as to
costs disclose the following position.
<P>

18   	As at 19 May 1999 the plaintiff's solicitor's costs
amounted to $21,000 with disbursements at $1,114.  Counsel's fees to that
date
amounted to $9,110 and the plaintiff's costs for the hearing thereafter were as
to solicitor's $5,500 to $7,000 based on a three
day hearing with counsel's
fees of a similar amount.  This totals $42,224 to $45,224.  At the time of
service of the offer of compromise
the plaintiff was liable for her own costs
in an amount of about $31,224..
<P>

19   	The 1st defendant's costs for solicitors were $16,211.85
to date plus $328.97 disbursements and counsel's fees of $4,550.
 Solicitor's
fees of $6,000 were estimated for a three day hearing and counsel's fees of
$7,000 were estimated for that hearing.
 This totals $34,090.82.  At the time
of service of the offer of compromise the 1st defendant's costs were in the
order of $21,090.82.
<P>

20   	In contrast the estimate for the 2nd defendant was a sum
of $100,000 inclusive of counsel's fees and disbursements to the
conclusion of
the proceedings.  The 2nd defendant had signed a costs' agreement in April 1997
in which the total costs were estimated
at $30,000.  In March 1999 that
estimate was increased to $50,000, in April 1999 the estimate was increased to
$60,000 with costs
to the conclusion of the hearing estimated at $100,000.
Without commenting on the appropriateness of these charges one thing that
is
apparent is the 2nd defendant's costs were almost double that of the
plaintiff's a fact which she or her advisers would not have
been able to
anticipate.
<P>

21   	I turn to the question of proper principles to be used in
considering the plaintiff's application.  There are a number of
cases which
suggest that in the ordinary case the plaintiff can not usually apply to
discontinue on terms that an order for costs
be made against the defendant.
See <b>Mulcahey v Wilkinson </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281887%29%209%20ALT%2022" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1887) 9 ALT 22</a>, <b>Lambton &amp; Co v
Parkinson </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281887%29%2035%20WLR%20545" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1887) 35 WLR 545</a> and <b>Denman Homes Pty Ltd v Madnara
</b>Needham J 14 September 183.  
<P>

22   	More recent cases suggest that in exceptional cases a
costs' order may be made against a defendant.  An example of this was
<b>Garwolin Nominees Pty Limited v Statewide Building Society </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1984/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] VicRp 38</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20VR%20469" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) VR
469.</a>  In that case the plaintiff had obtained practical success before the
hearing because the defendant has given up possession which
was sought by the
plaintiff.  A similar more general approach was adopted in <b>Telstra
Corporation v Australian Telecommunications Authority </b>Supreme Court of
Victoria Hayne J 10 June 1994 unreported.  However, in that case His Honour did
not make an order that the defendant
pay the plaintiff's costs.  When dealing
with a claim for dismissal of a cross claim which was not sought to be pursued
and which
could not be discontinued as the hearing had commenced, His Honour,
McLelland J, as he then was in <b>Ritz Hotel v Charles of the Ritz </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=12%20IPR%2075" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">12 IPR
75</a> at 77 took the view that such decisions should not be confined and should be
made in a manner best calculated to achieve justice
as between the parties in
the circumstances of the particular case before the court.
<P>

23   	The plaintiff's case that she have costs against the 2nd
defendant has as one of its basic assumptions that the plaintiff
had a good
case which ultimately became one which could not be pursued once the 2nd
defendant's true financial position became apparent.
 This raises fairly
squarely the question of the extent to which in an application such as the
present, one should consider the strengths
of a party's case.  Frequently when
parties settle a case, apart from costs, the court is called upon to determine
what order as
to costs should be applied.  
<P>

24   	The principles normally applied in these circumstances
were summarised by Mr Justice Hill in <b>Australian Securities Commission v
Aust-Home Investments Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=34%20FCR%20194" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">34 F.C.R. 194.</a>  At page 201 His Honour
summarised the cases in the following way:- 
<P>

"(1)  Where neither party desires to proceed with litigation the Court should
be ready to facilitate the conclusion of the proceedings
by making a cost
order: Stratford and the SEQEB  case. 
<P>

(2)  It will rarely, if ever, be appropriate, where there has been no trial on
the merits, for a Court determining how the costs
of the proceeding should be
borne to endeavour to determine for itself the case on the merits or, as it
might be put, to determine
the outcome of a hypothetical trial: Stratford.
This will particularly be the case where a trial on the merits would involve
complex
factual matters where credit could be an issue. 
<P>

(3)  In determining the question of costs it would be appropriate, however, for
the Court to determine whether the applicant acted
reasonably in commencing the
proceedings and whether the respondent acted reasonably in defending them
(SEQEB). 
<P>

(4)  In a particular case it might be appropriate for the Court in its
discretion to consider the conduct of a respondent prior
to the commencement of
the proceedings where such conduct may have precipitated the litigation: cf
Sunday Times Newspaper Co Ltd
v McIntosh <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1933/37.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1933] NSWStRp 37</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281933%29%2033%20SR%20%28%20NSW%29%20371" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1933) 33 SR ( NSW) 371.</a> 
<P>

(5)  Where the proceedings terminate after interlocutory relief has been
granted, the Court may take into account the fact that
interlocutory relief has
been granted: cf Re Asiatic Electric Co Pty Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1973%5d%201%20NSWLR%20603" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1973] 1 NSWLR 603</a> at 606, a
case which, however, depended upon the specific working of the statute under
consideration." 
<P>

25   	Recently some of these principles have been approved by
McHugh J in <b>Re Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs</b>; Ex parte
QIN <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 6</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=71%20ALJR%20533" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">71 ALJR 533.</a>  His Honour noted that the court when it does not determine a
matter is deprived of the factor that usually determines whether or
how it will
make a costs order, namely, the result.  He then went on to say:- 
<P>

"In an appropriate case, a court will make an order for costs even when there
has been no hearing on the merits and the moving party
no longer wishes to
proceed with the action.  The court cannot try a hypothetical action between
the parties. To do so would burden
the parties with the costs of a litigated
action which by settlement or extra-curial action they had avoided.  In some
cases, however,
the court may be able to conclude that one of the parties has
acted so unreasonably that the other party should obtain the costs
of the
action.  In administrative law matters, for example, it may appear that the
defendant has acted unreasonably in exercising
or refusing to exercise a power
and that the plaintiff had no reasonable alternative but to commence a
litigation.  Thus, for example,
in R v Gold Coast City Council; Ex parte Raysun
Pty Ltd, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Queensland gave a prosecutor
seeking
mandamus the costs of the proceedings up to the date when the
respondent Council notified the prosecutor that it would give the prosecutor
the relief that it sought.  The Full Court said that the prosecutor had
reasonable ground for complaint in respect of the attitude
taken by the
respondent in failing to consider the application by the prosecutor for
approval of road and drainage plans. 
<P>

Moreover, in some cases a judge may feel confident that, although both parties
have acted reasonably, one party was almost certain
to have succeeded if the
matter had been fully tried.  This is perhaps the best explanation of the
unreported decision of Pincus
J in South East Queensland Electricity Board v
Australian Telecommunications Commission where his Honour ordered the
respondent to
pay 80 per cent of the applicant's taxed costs even though his
Honour found that both parties had acted reasonably in respect of
the
litigation.  But such cases are likely to be rare."
<P>

26   	As is clearly indicated by these excerpts it is
inappropriate for the court to determine the case on the merits or to determine
the outcome of a hypothetical trial.  However, the court can take the
preliminary step of determining whether the plaintiff acted
reasonably in
commencing the proceedings.  
<P>

27   	His Honour Mr Justice McHugh refers to a decision of
Pincus J in <b>South East Queensland Electricity Board v Australian
Telecommunications Commission </b>and comments that a Judge may in some cases
feel confident that although the parties acted reasonably one party was almost
certain
to have succeeded if the matter had been fully tried.
<P>

28   	In the present case certainly one could not come to such a
conclusion.  Leaving aside questions of the 2nd defendant's financial
situation, this matter was replete with claims of conduct disentitling and
accordingly it would have been impossible without trying
the action to
determine whether the plaintiff might have succeeded even putting to one side
the second defendant's financial situation.
 
<P>

29   	It seems to me that all I can do in considering the
plaintiff's request is to see whether the proceedings were commenced
reasonably.
 Even this decision has to be made on a somewhat limited basis.

<P>

30   	So far as concerns the commencement of proceedings the
salient facts are as I have set out earlier.  There are only two claimants,
the
plaintiff and the 2nd  defendant and the property was left to the 2nd
defendant.  The plaintiff's financial situation at the
time of the commencement
was somewhat different from her situation as it developed later.  The
plaintiff's situation as disclosed
in her affidavit showed that she had
separated from her husband in 1995.  She and her husband had occupied a
property at Carrabubula
which was owned by a company.  That company effectively
was the company of her parents-in-law and the plaintiff did not consider
that
the shares which she held were effectively hers.  The plaintiff and her husband
at the commencement of the proceedings still
carried on a partnership for
taxation purposes which arose from the operations on the property.  The
plaintiff was a part-time teacher
receiving a fortnightly wage of some $715.
The assets in the partnership included stock, an investment house in Tamworth
and also
a unit at Penrith.  The plaintiff also had an interest in a home which
was occupied by her mother and she regarded it as belonging
to her mother who
used it as her place of residence.  The plaintiff had four children of a young
age at school.  In contrast, by
the time the proceedings were commenced the
plaintiff knew that the second defendant had separated from her husband, she
had three
young children, was living on a pension and received the whole of the
property of the deceased.
<P>

31   	The plaintiff also knew having regard to the letters from
the Executor that there was likely to be a contest about her entitlement.
 She
knew she had been excluded and that her father had expressed reasons to others
as to why he had not left her any further provision.
<P>

32   	Because these allegations of conduct disentitling have not
been fully investigated it is impossible for me at this stage to
determine
whether or not the plaintiff reasonably commenced the proceedings.  She knew
that she was in a difficult position.  She
was in the throws of separation and
ultimately divorce from her husband and she had little assets that were not
tied up with her
husband.  She had the care of her children.  Her sister also
was separated with three children and was living on a supporting parent's
pension in the house of the deceased where she had been looking after him.  
<P>

33   	Without real knowledge of the facts behind the questions
of conduct disentitling, it is almost impossible to form a conclusion
as to
whether or not the proceedings were commenced reasonably.  In effect a court
would have to try the plaintiff's perception of
what she understood might be
the conduct disentitling and whether she believed she would succeed on that
issue.  
<P>

34   	The other matters that have to be considered on the
plaintiff's application are, of course, her suggestion that she was ambushed
by
deliberate actions on the part of the 2nd defendant.  
<P>

35   	What stands out about the course of the history of the
matter is that the 2nd defendant mortgaged the property immediately
after it
was transferred to her in 1996.  She knew of the plaintiff's concerns about the
will and that the distribution was unfair
at that time.  The delays by the 2nd
defendant in putting on her evidence from July 1997 until early in 1999 are
inexcusable.  I
say this notwithstanding that on some occasions the plaintiff
had to file additional evidence as her situation changed.  The only
matters
which arise really are whether or not the plaintiff might have prudently
searched prior to commencing proceedings to find
out the existence of the
mortgage.  The plaintiff knew the property had been transferred to her sister
but she certainly did not
know of the mortgage.  In the ordinary course, given
the 2nd defendant's situation, it would probably be somewhat extraordinary for
the plaintiff or her solicitors to have anticipated that the 2nd defendant
would take the course of gratuitously mortgaging a property
for no benefit to
herself.  It was a very foolish thing to do.  
<P>

36   	It is, however, apparent from the chronology that I have
recounted that the plaintiff's solicitor became aware shortly after
12 April
1999 of the existence of the mortgage and discussed it with his client.  The
advice at that stage from counsel apparently
indicated that this was more a
matter of credit.  To my mind given the situation of the parties, this is
somewhat extraordinary.
 The Court can only designate property as notional
estate in order to satisfy an order.  The mortgaging of the property which
could
have been fully investigated within ten days or so after this knowledge
came to light should have substantially changed the plaintiff's
outlook in
respect of her case.  Clearly the defendant's situation had changed for the
worse, no doubt, because of her own foolishness.
 She had as many
responsibilities, if not more than the plaintiff, so far as educating young
children was concerned.  In my view
a proper assessment towards the end of
April would have indicated to the plaintiff the wisdom of not proceeding
further with her
claim.  The offer that was made on 27 April 1999 certainly was
one which would have allowed the plaintiff to escape the litigation
at minimal
cost.  Even though the offer did not include an amount for the defendant's
costs at most the plaintiff would have been
out of pocket by several thousand
dollars and she may have been able to negotiate some better arrangement of
that.  Given the importance
of the matter I can see no justification for the
plaintiff not having accepted the offer as she had adequate opportunities to
determine
at that stage that it would be extremely foolish to proceed with the
proceedings.
<P>

37   	In summary, therefore, one has a situation where the
plaintiff has commenced the proceedings in circumstances where it is
not
possible, given the nature of the present state of the proceedings, for me to
determine whether she was reasonable in commencing
the proceedings.  The
proceedings also reached a point towards the end of April 1999 when on any view
of the matter the plaintiff
should have ceased and accepted an offer which
would have enabled her to escape with little cost consequences.  
<P>

38   	There remains the fact that no steps were taken by the 2nd
defendant to make plain her financial situation.  I can only conclude
that
keeping the knowledge of its poor state from the plaintiff was a deliberate
course of action on her part.
<P>

39   	As between the plaintiff and the 2nd defendant the only
conclusion available is that the plaintiff should not have her costs
as against
the 2nd defendant.  So far as the 2nd defendant is concerned, she only became a
party in July 1997.  Her actions in failing
to file her evidence in a timely
way meant that the plaintiff had no way in a practical sense of assessing her
case because of the
lack of information on the 2nd defendant's real financial
position.  I have concluded that the plaintiff ought to have known this
by the
end of April 1999 and accordingly I see no reason why the 2nd defendant should
recover costs against the plaintiff prior to
that date.  From 30 April 1999 I
am satisfied that it is appropriate that the plaintiff should pay the 2nd
defendant's costs from
that date.
<P>

40   	So far as the 1st defendant is concerned, there are some
difficulties.  The 1st defendant seeks an order that his costs be
paid out of
the estate or, alternatively, paid by the plaintiff.  I have earlier recounted
the evidence that shows the steps the
Executor took with regard to the
deliberate distribution of the estate with notice of the plaintiff's claim.
<P>

41   	Recently, in a case of <b>D'Albora v D'Albora </b>21 May
1999 I set out at length a number of cases dealing with the personal liability
of an Executor where he distributes with notice
of a possible claim prior to
the 18 months within which an application under the <b>Family Provison Act</b>
can be made.  The Executor says that he did not know that the correspondence
would prevent him from distributing the assets.  However,
that lack of
knowledge is no excuse.  The situation is that the Executor distributed the
property improperly when he had notice of
a possible claim.  That distribution
permitted the 2nd defendant to take the steps which she did in mortgaging the
property.  It
was submitted by the 1st defendant that unless I found that it
was because of the mortgaging of the property that the plaintiff's
claim was
bound to fail that he should not be penalised for this early distribution.  Be
that as it may, the Executor's action certainly
compounded the difficulties
which the plaintiff had and in these circumstances I can see no justification
for allowing the Executor
his costs against the plaintiff.  In my view the
Executor is entitled to indemnity costs out of the estate.  In practical terms
that
means that he would have to look to the 2nd defendant, to whom he has
distributed the estate, for recovery of those costs.  That
is a matter between
them.
<P>

42   	Accordingly, the orders that I make are as follows:-
<P>

1.	I give leave to the plaintiff to discontinue the proceedings on terms:-
<P>

(a)	That no further proceedings be brought by the plaintiff based upon the
cause of action propounded in the present proceedings.
<P>

(b)	That the plaintiff pay the 2nd defendant's costs on and from 30 April 1999
on a party and party basis.
<P>

2.	The 1st defendant's costs on an indemnity basis may be paid or retained out
of the estate of the deceased.
<P>
