<b>3863 of 1998	SYFURN PTY LIMITED  -v-</b>
<P>

<b>			CHIEF COMMISSIONER FOR LAND TAX</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>    By summons filed on 8 September 1989, the plaintiff Syfurn
Pty Limited seeks an order that the statutory demand issued by the
defendant
the Chief Commissioner of State Revenue be set aside.
<P>

2	By that demand, dated 14 August 1998, the Chief Commissioner of State Revenue
claims payment to him by the plaintiff of the amount
of $14,996.70.  That debt
is described in the schedule to the demand and comprises land tax for the 1998
year in an amount of $14,211.80
and interest on unpaid land tax pursuant to
section 21 of the Tax Administration Act 1996, of $784.90, making a total of
$14,996.70.
<P>

3	The plaintiff through its solicitors expressly does not dispute the
substantive amount of the land tax referred to in the statutory
demand.
However, the plaintiff disputes the amount of interest claimed.
<P>

4	The plaintiff, however, does not place before the Court any alternative
amount to suggest that the manner of the calculation of
the interest has
proceeded upon on incorrect formula.
<P>

5	In his affidavit sworn on 10 February 1999, Peter Mackey, a solicitor in the
employ of the Crown Solicitor, who has the carriage
of the matter on behalf of
the defendant, states in paragraph 4 how the interest on the assessed sum of
land tax has been calculated
and how the figure of $784.90 has been arrived
at.
<P>

6	In the absence of some submission on the part of the plaintiff concerning
either the formula to be applied in the calculation
of interest or concerning
the correctness of the application of that formula to the amount of unpaid land
tax, I am not satisfied
that there is any genuine dispute as to the amount of
interest owing by the plaintiff upon the unpaid land tax.
<P>

7	The ground upon which the plaintiff, however, seeks to have the statutory
demand set aside is that, so it is submitted, the plaintiff
has complied with
that demand.  The demand requires, by paragraph 3 thereof, that the plaintiff
within twenty-one days of service
upon it of the demand shall do one of two
things.  (A) to pay to the creditor the total of the amounts of the debts; or
(B) to secure
or compound the total of the amounts of the debts to the
creditor's reasonable satisfaction.
<P>

8	The plaintiff submits that it has compounded the total of the amounts of the
debts to the defendant's reasonable satisfaction.
In that regard the plaintiff
relies upon the material set forth in paragraph 3 of the affidavit of Michael
Norman Rayhill sworn 8
March 1999.
<P>

9	That paragraph was objected to by the solicitor for the defendant on the
ground, firstly, of form, in that the conversation set
forth therein was not
given in the first person; and, secondly, on the ground of relevance. Despite
the objection upon those grounds,
I admitted the paragraph into evidence.
<P>

10	The highest that the conversation set forth in those paragraphs can be put
is that there was a discussion between a representative
of the defendant and
the solicitor for the plaintiff in which the plaintiff was informed that an
offer of payment by instalments
would not be accepted by the defendant but that
the defendant would accept payment in full of the amount owing out of the
proceeds
of the contemplated refinancing or the contemplated sale of the
property which was, the subject of the land tax assessment.
<P>

11	As I understand it, the concept of compounding a debt means agreeing to
accept a lesser amount in full satisfaction of a debt
for a higher amount. In
the instant case, even if the defendant did agree to accept payment of the
amount claimed out of the proceeds
of the refinancing or the sale of the
subject property, any such agreement related only to payment in total of the
outstanding debt.
Even if there be an agreement along the lines submitted by
the plaintiff, that agreement would not constitute a compounding of the
debt
owing to the defendant. But, further, it does not appear to me that a statement
along the lines set forth in paragraph 3 of
Mr Rayhill's affidavit constitutes
an agreement which would bind the defendant.
<P>

12	There have been a number of earlier approaches by the plaintiff to the
defendant for payment by instalments and for an attempt
to negotiate the manner
by which the debt would be paid. However, as I have said, even if the
conversations were to be treated as
an agreement, which I am not persuaded they
should be, that conversation and an agreement along those lines do not
constitute a compounding
of the debt.
<P>

13	In those circumstances, since there is no dispute as to the existence or the
amount of the debt, the plaintiff has not satisfied
me that there are any
grounds upon which the demand should be set aside.
<P>

14	It follows therefore that I will dismiss the plaintiff's summons. I make the
following orders: 
<P>

	1)  I order that the summons be dismissed.
<P>

	2)  I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the defendant.  
<P>

3) 	Upon the application of the plaintiff, which is opposed by the defendant, I
order that the period for compliance with the demand
referred to in the summons
be extended up to and including 6 April 1999.
<P>
