FRIDAY 23 APRIL 1999
<P>

<center><b>REGINA v. PAUL JAMES CARR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b></center>
<P>


<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	The applicant Paul James Carr makes application pursuant to s.13A of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a> for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term
in lieu of the sentence of penal servitude for life imposed upon him
by
Mathews, J. on 29 July 1988 in this court at Newcastle.
<P>

2	That sentence was imposed upon him by her Honour for the murder of Frederick
Schmidt on 21 September 1987.
<P>

3	The sentence was imposed following a trial at which the applicant pleaded not
guilty.  He was convicted following the jury's verdict
of guilty.
<P>

4	He had, in an unsworn statement, asserted that he was not present at the time
of the killing.  Her Honour held, and I quote from
her remarks on sentence:-
<P>

	"It was a brutal, savage and unprovoked attack upon this man.  He took some
steps, it seems, in the earlier stages of the confrontation
with you to defend
himself but the injury which was finally inflicted which led to the death of
this man, namely the cutting of his
throat, was done at a time when he was
either unconscious or approaching unconsciousness.  As such it was a vindictive
and savage
attack, and there are no circumstances at all which can in any way
diminish your culpability for this offence".
<P>

5	Her Honour held that the killing was brutal and unprovoked.  A completely
unnecessary tragedy for which the applicant bore the
entire responsibility with
no mitigating features whatsoever.
<P>

6	Her Honour referred to the motive for the killing, having been a grudge
nursed by the applicant as a consequence of an earlier
dispute with Mr.
Schmidt, which had led to the applicant being charged with the offence of
maliciously wounding Mr. Schmidt and being
sentenced by a magistrate to 12
months imprisonment, of which he served a minimum term of six months.
<P>

7	That malicious wounding, her Honour noted, had involved a stabbing of Mr.
Schmidt which she described as, "not particularly serious(ly)".
 The learned
magistrate had described the wounding as, "in a manner which showed a reckless
disregard by you".
<P>

8	Mathews, J. adverted to the applicant's not particularly long criminal
record.  That record, as well as the malicious wounding
offence I have referred
to, also referred to some minor matters of dishonesty as a child in Victoria
and the ACT, and traffic offences
in Western Australia, as well as the offence
of cultivate cannabis.
<P>

9	Her Honour pointed out that, "albeit that you are still only very young,
being only 21 years old, nevertheless my  hands are tied".
 Her Honour was
adverting to s.19A of the Crimes Act as it then stood which required that in
the absence of mitigatory circumstances
found by her she was to pass the
penalty of penal servitude for life, which penalty she did pass.
<P>

10	The sentence dated from 1 October 1987.
<P>

11	It is common ground before me that that date was both the applicant's arrest
date, first day in custody, and the first date on
which the applicant was
remanded in custody.
<P>

12	Any minimum term and additional term will comprise a sentence which,
pursuant to s.13A, shall commence on that date.
<P>

13	The application is not itself opposed by the Crown.  It is accepted that a
minimum term should be imposed to date from that date
together with an
additional term, and it is further accepted that in this case the additional
term should be less than life, an additional
term which, peculiarly to such
applications, is available.
<P>

14	The sentence of penal servitude for life will be replaced by a minimum term
and additional term which I impose pursuant to s.13A.
<P>

15	I am required, in considering this application, to have regard to all of the
circumstances surrounding the offence for which
the life sentence was imposed
and all offences wherever committed of which the person has been convicted at
any time, so far as this
information is reasonably available to the Supreme
Court.
<P>

16	In this regard there has been tendered to me the prisoner's Corrective
Services record which includes, as well as disciplinary
offences within the
gaol system, offences of assault on 6 July 1990 dealt with at the Maitland
Local Court for which he received
four months hard labour, and malicious damage
to property on 27 March 1995 at the Cootamundra Local Court for which he
received one
months hard labour.  I have regard to those matters and I have
regard to his conduct and behaviour whilst in custody, which conduct
and
behaviour has included, on occasions, a conscientious refusal to submit himself
for urinalysis, the possession of equipment for
the administering of drugs, the
detection of the use of cannabis, and on two occasions the possession of
sharpened pieces of metal
as well as other contraband.  Those two sharpened
pieces of metal being described as "shivs".  The evidence before me is that he
had those last items for his protection in a difficult gaol environment.  That
evidence is not assailed by the Crown, although regard
to it is urged upon me
on the topic of rehabilitation.
<P>

17	Section 13A(9) requires me to have regard to the report and the
supplementary report made by the Serious Offenders Review Council.
 They have
been tendered and are Exhibit B.  I have had regard to them as I must.
<P>

18	The additional material to that report from the Council which is contained
as part of the documentation in Exhibit C and is digested
on the one page
document headed "Supplementary Documentation from Serious Offenders Review
Council".
<P>

19	The report discloses, in the various other matters to which it adverts,
reference to the early years of the inmate's imprisonment
which were
characterised by unruly and abusive behaviour and difficulty in conforming with
the institutional regime.
<P>

20	It comments that for much of his time in custody the applicant has not been
a generally serious management problem.  It refers
to the recent drug offences
and matters that have precluded his classification advancing further than it
has.  It refers to a necessity
for monitoring management and progression,
perseverance with drug and alcohol counselling and development, a management
plan for
progressive reduction to classifications leading eventually to the
applicant's inclusion in unsupervised temporary leave.
<P>

21	Nonetheless, it is clear that any such temporary leave will not occur for a
substantial time and that there is a doubt, or question
mark, to some extent,
cast upon the applicant's prospects for complete rehabilitation, as submitted
by the Crown, by his continued
insistence on his innocence of the offence.
<P>

22	In my view that is of most limited significance overall in the context of
this applicant's present application, since he had,
in an interview with Dr.
Lucas, whose report is Exhibit 2, expressed the view that although he had been
angry about his conviction
initially that was over and done with.  He did not
believe the evidence against him proved his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  He
expressed some dissatisfaction with some facets of that evidence.
<P>

23	It is sufficient for the purpose of dealing with this aspect to say that on
a reading of the crucial answer in the unsigned record
of interview where he
allegedly confessed his guilt to a police officer, and considering some of the
matters contained in the statement
of facts, which is Exhibit A, concerning the
evidence of one of the witnesses at the trial, whatever be the fact of the
applicant's
guilt, one could understand some dissatisfaction of that sort with
the evidence.  However, he told Dr. Lucas that his sentence left
him with two
choices;  to do his time and get out of prison to begin work;  or to hang
himself.  He chose the former option.
<P>

24	He discussed the matter in a way which led Dr. Lucas to accept that
suggested he had come to terms with what he saw as his situation
and although
unhappy about it he was not noticeably bitter.
<P>

25	He expressed remorse that Mr. Schmidt had died, albeit he did not express
remorse at his having killed Mr. Schmidt.
<P>

26	He gave evidence before me.  As he had before Dr. Lucas he expressed the
view he wished to work towards eventual release from
prison so he might join
his family, or such of them as remain, in Queensland.
<P>

27	His upbringing, detailed by Dr. Lucas, and as appears from the other
documentary material, indicates that he had had a childhood
without the benefit
of some of the advantages others had received.  Dr. Lucas concluded that he
comes from a disrupted and emotionally
deprived background, and was in a fair
amount of minor trouble at a young age.  He has realistic plans with regard to
the future
in prison, and on the face of it Dr. Lucas concludes:-
<P>

	"One would think that with support from his family and a parole officer he
should be able to make a successful return to the community.
 He has expressed
willingness to seek and accept help and resume work satisfactorily.  There is
evidence he has settled down over
the years."
<P>

28	The Crown Prosecutor does not assert that there is an aggravating feature to
the offence of the accused having deliberately brought
the knife to the scene.
The Crown does assert that the accused deliberately went to the scene and
sought to carry out an intent formed
prior to attack on the deceased.
<P>

29	The killing, on its face, clearly involved an intent to kill.  One can only
say that that intent seems to have been formed at
some time during the assault
and that the knife appears to have come to hand at some time during the
assault.
<P>

30	It was a brutal and horrible killing, as her Honour has said, and there is,
in terms of objective culpability, no matter with
which one would disagree, in
what her Honour has said about it.
<P>

31	But before her Honour there was little as to the subjective circumstances
because of the legal parameters of the task she was
then undertaking.  Before
me there is the material from Dr. Lucas, and the material provided by the Crown
as to his circumstances
in custody, and the material provided in Exhibit 1 by
way of certificates of his attainment and skills acquired whilst in gaol.
These
have included, reading, completing the alcohol and other drugs peer
education programme, the peer counselling programme, ceramics-building
programme, oral communication programme, basic food skills TAFE programme.  And
the applicant has shown himself whilst in gaol to
be a multi-faceted gaol
tradesman, working in many skilled jobs and in positions of trust, including,
on occasion, as a head cook
and as a plumber.
<P>

32	He is now 31 years of age.  His age at the time of the commission of the
offence was described by her Honour as 21.
<P>

33	As pointed out by his counsel, the material establishes that although there
were prior offences of violence there has been no
offence of violence in gaol
since 1990.
<P>

34	The reports of the Serious Offenders Review Council indicate that albeit
there may be some question relating to rehabilitation,
nonetheless, it can not
be said that there are not materially good prospects for rehabilitation, at
least eventually.
<P>

35	All of these are matters to which s.13A requires me to have regard.
<P>

36	Both counsel submit that this is a matter in which an additional term might
properly be extended beyond that which might otherwise
have been appropriate
and both submit in the context of the statistics and other matters that an
additional term of six years would
be appropriate.  That is a term to which
regard should be had in the light of what will happen in the future.  The
principles in
relation to re-determination under s.13A of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a>
require the court to fix a sentence that would be appropriate if the mandatory
life penalty had not applied at the time of the commission
of the offence.
<P>

37	As well as taking into account those factors which indicate that
rehabilitation has occurred since the original sentence was
passed, all the
relevant considerations normally appropriate to be considered on sentence, such
as retribution and deterrence, must
be considered.  Those considerations
include the culpability of the  crime in question.
<P>

38	On re-determination of sentence, the court has the advantage of being able
to see the effects of the lengthy period of confinement
and the conduct of the
applicant whilst in custody, ie., the effect on him of punishment and the
degree of personal deterrence.
<P>

39	This is valuable material for the assessment of what is an appropriate
course to take for the future and, of course, the statutory
requirement of the
provision to the court of the relevant reports from the Council ensures that
the court has much more information
for that aspect of the sentence which will
be served in the future then a sentencing court would normally have.
<P>

40	I accept the submissions made by both counsel, that an additional term of
six years is appropriate in this case.  I turn now
to the minimum term.
<P>

41	The applicant's counsel has submitted in the light of the statistics, and
looking at culpability, that a minimum term of 13 years
to commence, as I said,
from 1 October 1987 would be appropriate.
<P>

42	To answer the culpability and to take into account the subjective matters,
Mr. Thompson, who appears for the Director, has submitted
that in the light of
the range of sentences imposed on re-determinations under s.13A, and in the
light of sentences imposed for this
crime otherwise, an appropriate range of
sentence would be 13 to 14 years, with consideration to be given to the matter
of aggravation
arising from the offence having been committed in consequence of
the grudge nursed as a result of the previous altercation.
<P>

43	The applicant's counsel refers to the age of the applicant at the time and
points to the requirement under s.13A(9)(d), that
the section requires that age
specially be considered.
<P>

44	The applicant remains a young man.  He has taken a human life and committed
the most serious crime in the calendar. That is a
crime for which a judge
redetermining a sentence, as much as a sentencing judge, is required to visit
with a most severe sentence.
 It is a crime that was, in this case, aggravated
by the grudge that has been referred to.  Nonetheless, it is a crime committed
by a young man who came from circumstances that were not to his advantage, who
appears to have committed that crime whilst in the
heat of passions generated
in the course of his committing another crime, but without prior intent or
planning.  He has not been
a model prisoner, but of late he appears to have
been a most useful prisoner with real prospects within the community.
<P>

45	In my view the appropriate sentence to be passed by way of minimum term is a
sentence of 13 years and six months penal servitude
to date from 1 October 1987
and to expire on 31 March 2001.  The additional term should therefore date from
1 April 2001 and expire
on 31 March 2007.
<P>

46	Mr. Carr, I grant your application and I set both a minimum term of
imprisonment that you must serve for the offence for which
the sentence was
originally imposed and an additional term during which you may be released on
parole. The minimum term is a sentence
of 13 years and six months penal
servitude to date from 1 October 1987 and expiring on 31 March 2001.  The
additional term of six
years shoud therefore date from 1 April 2001 and expire
on 31 March 2007.
