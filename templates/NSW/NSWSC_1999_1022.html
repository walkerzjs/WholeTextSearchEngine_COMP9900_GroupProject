<b>FRIDAY 8 OCTOBER 1999</b>
<P>

<b><u>4219/99 NRMA INSURANCE LIMITED v PETER CARROLL</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiff NRMA Insurance Limited, by
summons filed on 6 October 1999, seeks orders under s 1322 of the
<u>Corporations Law</u> (1) that the period within which the Directors must
call a meeting of members as required by s 249D of that law and Article 8 of
the Articles of Association of the plaintiff company be extended to 30 June
2000; and (2) that the date by which the required meeting
be held pursuant to
the requisition be extended to 31 August 2000.
<P>

2   	The requisition for the general meeting signed by the
required 100 members was in the hands of the plaintiff on 20 September
1999.  I
put it that way because while a purported requisition was delivered to the
plaintiff company some days earlier, it was not
at that stage signed by the
required number of members; by 20 September it was.
<P>

3   	That requisition required the calling of a general meeting
to consider what was called "The following notice of motion".  That
notice of
motion was for an amendment of the Articles of Association of the plaintiff by
inserting in the article dealing with the
business to be conducted at the
Annual General Meeting, a new subparagraph (d) as follows:
<P>

(d)	To receive and consider a report of the Directors (which shall be made as a
separate report in addition to other statements
and reports) specifying:
<P>

I.	The amount of profit or surplus, if any, available for distribution as
rebates or other benefits to members; and
<P>

II.	The proposals or purposes of the Directors in respect of any such profit or
surplus; and
<P>

III.	If there is no such profit or surplus, or no such proposals or purposes,
the reasons therefore.
<P>

4   	An explanatory memorandum was attached to the requisition
which, as I understand it, it was intended should be forwarded with
the notice
convening the general meeting.
<P>

5   	In accordance with that requisition and the provisions of s
249D of the<b> </b><u>Corporations Law</u>, and Article 8 of the Articles of
Association which is in the same terms as the provisions of the<b>
</b><u>Corporations Law</u><b>,</b> the Directors were required, within 21
days, to call the meeting for a date not later than two months after the date
on which the
requisition was lodged in this case by not later than 21 November
1999.
<P>

6   	There is an Annual General Meeting of the plaintiff company
called for 16 November 1999.
<P>

7   	As is well-known, the plaintiff company is a company
limited by guarantee, namely a mutual company, and has, according to the
evidence, 1,400,000 members.  Thus the calling of any Extraordinary General
Meeting is a big task. It also involves very considerable
expense.  The way in
which the plaintiff has sought to reduce this expense of calling its Annual
General Meeting in the past has
been to use what are referred to in the
evidence as the "Open Road" arrangements, which can be described as an agreed
arrangement
with Australia Post for the production of address tapes for members
and a special arrangement for printing and packaging and delivery
of the
packages to Australia Post in an agreed sequence over a period of four weeks.
The effect of this is that in an arrangement
such as that, notices to members
are received by them over a period of about one month.  This arrangement, it
seems from the evidence,
costs substantially less, and probably less than half,
than the costs incurred with a normal postage run; the cost of the normal
run
depending, of course, on the size and weight of the envelopes and the material
in those envelopes.
<P>

8   	As is well-known in the community, and the Court can hardly
be expected not to know, there are proposals for the demutualisation
of the
plaintiff company which are supported by some members of the Board of that
company.  There are also Directors of NRMA, as
opposed to the insurance
company, who oppose what might be described as the demutualisation of the
insurance company.  In general
terms this appears from the explanatory
memorandum which Mr Carroll, who might be described as the leader of the
requisitionists,
wished to have sent out with the notice convening the special
meeting.
<P>

9   	According to the evidence before the Court if the proposal
for demutualisation proceeds it will proceed by way of scheme of
arrangement,
in which case no decision is likely to be made on this before December 1999.
There is also evidence that, whatever the
position, the next annual general
meeting of the plaintiff company is not likely to take place before September
or October 2000.
<P>

10   	The reasons advanced to support the claims for extension
of the convening period and the date by which the meeting must be
held are set
out in the evidence and appear to be four in number.
<P>

11   	The first of those is that the directors may wish to send
out some explanatory statements in relation to the proposed resolution,
and it
is said that there may be potential tax issues and, as I understand it, other
complex issues to which the directors may wish
to alert the members and which
it might be difficult to prepare, having regard to the existing time
constraints, it being said that
to get everything ready, the completed document
would have to be with the printers by 13 October.  The next reason is said to
be
the increased costs which would be incurred if the notices were sent out by
post in the ordinary way, rather than through what is
described as the  "Open
Road" system which could be satisfactorily used if the meeting were delayed.
The third reason is that as
there will not be an Annual General Meeting after
the one presently called for 16 November 1999 until late in the year 2000,
there
is no hurry.  The last reason is that as an Annual General Meeting has
been called, members may be confused if a special meeting
has to be held
shortly thereafter.
<P>

12   	None of these reasons seems to me to be sufficient to
justify the orders sought, even if taken together.  So far as the first
reason
is concerned, the fact is that the requisition was with the company on 20
September. It was obviously a matter which needed
to be dealt with urgently.
The evidence is that at a meeting held on 30 September, the Directors resolved
to make this application
to the Court.  That was ten days after the requisition
was received, which is a considerable period in view of the time constraints
of
which the Directors must have been aware. But, having said that, had the
Directors commenced with any explanatory statements they
wished to send out
when they received the requisition, then I do not understand they could not
have got that statement ready; and
I do not understand they could not do it now
in a reasonably short time.  It is difficult to understand the claim about tax
issues
which are said to present a problem.  If all that the requisition does
is to require the directors to tell the members the amount
of the profit or
surplus and the proposals for dealing with that, then there is no reason why,
when that is done, the directors cannot
give full consideration to, and advice
to the members on, any taxation implications.
<P>

13   	The next matter is the question of increased costs.  The
difficulty about that is that in ordinary circumstances if the Open
Road
program were to be used, then it would not be possible, as I understand it, for
the plaintiff company ever to comply with the
requirements of the law or the
Act for the calling of a general meeting on requisition.  Thus, although the
question of increased
costs is of some significance, it would appear to be one
of the burdens of membership of a mutual organisation such as the plaintiff
company and, in itself, would not justify the claims, although it may do so if
there were sufficient strength in the next matter
to which I will refer.
<P>

14   	That next matter is the evidence, that there will not be
another Annual General Meeting after the one presently called for
16 November
until September or October 2000.  It is therefore put that there is no hurry to
put this resolution before the members
because they would get no benefit from
its having been passed until late next year.  That, in itself, seems to be no
reason for the
delay which is sought, and in fact no explanation at all is
given for seeking the lengthy delay which is sought.  In the circumstances
which exist with this company I can see no reason why the members should not be
entitled to vote on this resolution as to the information
which the directors
must provide to them at an Annual General Meeting within the statutory time or
some reasonable time thereafter.
 It may be thought that as they will not know
the amount of the profit or surplus, if any, until the notice calling the
annual  general
meeting is sent out, that there is nothing that they would wish
to discuss and that there could be no benefit to them.  I do not
think that
that is the position.  It may well be that members of a mutual organisation
would like to be assured now that in the future
they will have this information
available to them, and in those circumstances I see no reason why they should
not be able to vote
on that now.
<P>

15   	The last matter put forward is confusion.  I am not sure
whether this is serious or not, but I just cannot understand how,
if properly
prepared notices are sent out, it could possibly be thought that there would be
any confusion in the mind of a member
as to which meeting was called for what
purpose.  In my view there is no substance in that claim of confusion.
<P>

16   	It follows from this that the summons should be dismissed,
or at least that the plaintiff should not be entitled the relief
claimed in it.
It may be necessary to extend the date by which the notice of meeting should be
sent out by some short time, and in
some ways it may be more convenient if the
Extraordinary General Meeting is held immediately after the conclusion of the
Annual General
Meeting, but that is a matter on which the plaintiff should be
entitled to decide, rather than the Court.  All that the Court need
do now is
to hear any submissions on whether any short extensions are required which
would be readily available within s 1322(4)(d)
of the<b> </b><u>Corporations
Law</u>.
<P>

17   	After a short adjournment, counsel for the plaintiff has
stated that if the orders sought are not made in the form asked,
then no other
orders are sought.  In those circumstances the order is:  The summons be
dismissed.  No order as to costs.
