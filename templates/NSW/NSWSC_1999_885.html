<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Commercial Tribunal of New South Wales ("the Tribunal"), constituted by his
Honour Judge
K P O'Connor, Chairman, given on 30 November 1998.  As the appeal
is brought under s 20(5) of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/cta1984192/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Tribunal Act 1984</a></i></b><i>
</i>("the Act"), it is limited to questions of law.
<P>

2   	Issues arising under the <b><i>Consumer Credit (New South
Wales) Code </i></b>("the Code") and the <b><i>Consumer Credit
Regulations</i></b> ("the regulations") were raised before his Honour and he
dealt with the matter with care and clarity in the 48 pages of his reasons
for
judgment.  In this Court, many of the same issues were debated again and
additional issues were raised on both sides, the issues
being said to raise
questions of law only.  I allowed the parties to raise the additional matters
as it seemed to me that the basic
question to be resolved was how the Code and
the regulations applied to the factual circumstances which were before his
Honour. 
I considered that it would be wrong to overlook relevant provisions of
the Code or the regulations if they bore upon the issues in
dispute.
<P>

3   	In the appeal, Mr R G Forster SC appeared for the
plaintiff, the Police Department Employees' Credit Union Limited ("the Union"),
and Mr P Bingham of counsel appeared for the first defendant, Pamela Flood.
<P>

4   	The <b><i>Consumer Credit Code</i></b> set out in the
<b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/cca1994276/" class="autolink_findacts">Consumer Credit (Queensland) Act 1994</a></i></b> (QLD) was, by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/cca1994276/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5</a> of the
<b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ccswa1995346/" class="autolink_findacts">Consumer Credit (New South Wales) Act 1995</a>,</i></b> applied as a law of
New South Wales under the name of the <b><i>Consumer Credit (New South Wales)
Code</i></b>.  Counsel are agreed that the Code relevantly came into operation
on 16 November 1996.  The Tribunal found that, in relation to a
credit contract
which Ms Flood had with the Union, the Union had breached ss 21(1)(b) and (c),
21(3), 26, 32(B), 32(E) and 32(I)
of the Code.  The Tribunal held that the
contraventions under ss 21(1)(b) and (c) and under s 32(E) of the Code
constituted contraventions
of key requirements, as specified in s 100 of the
Code, and accordingly, the Tribunal imposed a civil penalty in accordance with
the provisions of s 102 and ordered, under ss 103 and 104 of the Code, that the
penalties be paid to Ms Flood and set off against
the amount properly due under
the credit contract.
<P>

<b><u>The Credit Contract</u></b>
<P>

5   	Ms Flood joined the Union in October 1994 and by doing so
opened an S1 Easy Access Savings Account.  The S1 account was not
a credit
account.  By her application form, Ms Flood agreed to pay any charges required
by the Union as listed in the Rules and further
agreed to be bound by the Rules
and any amendments thereof.  On 27 January 1995, Ms Flood entered into a Line
of Credit Loan Agreement
("the L12 contract") under which she was granted a
credit loan in the sum of $3,000.  The written Agreement contained the
following
provisions:
<P>

<i>"10.	Interest shall be charged on the total principal, or so much thereof as
shall remain unpaid, at the rate determined from time
to time by the Board of
Directors of the Credit Union.</i>
<P>

<i>The current rate is 1.330 per month at monthly rests. 15.96%pa</i>
<P>

<i>11.	The member shall make payments of principal and interest at the rate of
$70 per fortnight.</i>
<P>

<i>12.	It is understood and agreed that advances may be made under this
agreement in a sum or sums not to exceed the Approved Amount
of $3000 and that
each of such advances shall constitute a loan and shall be added to the balance
then owing but so that the maximum
amount outstanding on the account at any
time shall not exceed the approved amount, plus charges and 1.330% of that
total amount."</i>
<P>

The Agreement also contained the following declaration and acceptance:
<P>

<i>"I declare that the information stated within this loan application is true
and correct in every particular, AND I HEREBY ACCEPT the
Terms and Conditions
set out above and acknowledge that I am subject to the liabilities and
restrictions imposed by the NSW Credit
Union Act (as amended) and by the Rules
of the Credit Union."</i>
<P>

It may be noted that the Agreement did not make provision for overdrawings,
save insofar as it referred to overdrawings to the extent
of 1.330% of credit
provided.  Otherwise, the express agreement was that Ms Flood would not exceed
the approved amount.
<P>

6   	The Tribunal held that the acceptance stated in the L12
contract was not sufficient to incorporate into the contract the rules
and
practices of the Union as they related to fees and charges.  I agree with that
view.  I would not interpret the contract as a
written agreement to pay the
subject overdrawn service fee ("OSF"), which on 27 January 1995 was $15 per
month.  At the most, the
terms of the acceptance should be given the
interpretation that the L12 contract was not to be read as inconsistent with
the liabilities
and restrictions imposed by the Rules of the Union and,
therefore, that it was not to be read as excluding, by written agreement,
the
operation of charges such as the OSF imposed under the Rules.
<P>

7   	At a Special General Meeting of the Union held on 21 July
1993, the Rules of the Union had been amended to include the following
provision:
<P>

<b><i>"20.6	Fees and Charges</i></b>
<P>

<i>(1)	Except as provided by the Code, the Board may from time to time
determine <b>fees and charges for any one service</b> provided by the credit
union.</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	The Board must cause notice of its determinations under this Rule to be
published at regular intervals to members and to be displayed
at all offices of
the Credit Union."</i>  (emphasis added)
<P>

One fee determined by the Board was a fee of $15 per month on an overdrawn
account.  This fee was first imposed on Ms Flood's overdrawn
account on 3 April
1995, and in most months thereafter.  Thus, Ms Flood was well aware of the
charge prior to the commencement of
the Code.  On 1 September 1996, after
discussion, the Union credited Ms Flood's account with $105 being a credit for
the last eight
months' OSF.  I need not explain why this occurred.  The
interest was not readjusted.  The fee was increased on or about 15 October
1996
to $17.50 per month.  The Schedule of Fees and Charges as at 15 October 1996
sent to members of the Union included this item:
<P>

<i>"<b>Overdrawn Savings or Line of Credit</b></i>
<P>

<i>*	Line of Credit Overdrawn by $200 of Approved Limit within   a calendar
month or any Savings Account overdrawn by $50    or more
 within  a  calendar
month  effective  from  1/12/96</i>
<P>

<i>..............................	$17.50 plus Line Of Credit Rate will be
charged on all overdrawn savings and amounts over the approved
Line Of Credit
limit."</i>
<P>

It was to be inferred by this description that the OSF was to be charged to the
overdrawn account, as occurred in fact.  There have
been no calculations to
show, and the Tribunal did not find, that the OSF charged to Ms Flood's account
did not accord with the authority
to impose it.
<P>

8   	Mr Bingham submitted that the rule introduced on 21 July
1993 did not authorise the Board to impose a charge on an overdrawn
credit
account.  He submitted that the words <i>"any one service"</i> should be read
as authorising the charging of a fee for a specific service which the Board had
agreed to provide.  In my opinion,
this submission should be rejected.  It is
clear from rule 20.6(2) that the rule was intended to encompass the range of
activities
in which the Union engaged with its members and that the Board
would, from time to time, determine relevant fees and charges and
would publish
those fees and charges to the members.  The rule was wide enough to authorise
the Board to impose an overdrawn service
fee (OSF) on the overdrawn accounts of
its members.  The provision of credit was a service.
<P>

9   	That was the view taken by the Tribunal.  The Tribunal
found that the OSF was lawfully imposed, that, on the balance of probabilities,
the information brochures relating to fees and charges, including the brochure
of October 1996, was sent to Ms Flood at the address
to which the monthly
accounts were sent and that Ms Flood was contractually bound to pay the fee.
<P>

10   	The Tribunal then held:
<P>

<i>"100.	It will be apparent from my analysis of the issues, that I regard the
OSF as not having been lawfully imposed by the <b>credit contract</b>.  On the
other hand I do regard it as having been lawfully imposed by <b>the membership
contract</b>."</i>
<P>

The Tribunal regarded this distinction between the credit contract and the
membership contract as crucial, notwithstanding that
the imposition of the
monthly charge, and of interest on the monthly balance increased thereby,
became a regular part of the credit
arrangements between Ms Flood and the Union
eighteen months before the Code came into operation.
<P>

11   	Under s 12 of the Code, the credit contract must be in the
form of a written contract document.  Section 15 sets out matters
which the
contract document must contain.  Had Ms Flood's credit transaction been entered
into after the commencement of the Code,
it would have been necessary for a
charge such as the OSF to have been included in the written contract.  That is
clear from the
requirement that the credit contract be a written document and
from s 15 of the Code which requires that all credit fees and charges
that are
or may become payable under the contract be stated.  However, that law did not
govern the transaction when Ms Flood entered
into her contract on 27 January
1995.  I am informed by Mr Bingham that, prior to the Code, the Union was not
required to ensure
that all relevant charges were set out in the relevant
written credit contract.
<P>

12   	Prior to the commencement of the Code, two arrangements
operated with respect to Ms Flood's by then overdrawn credit account.
 Firstly,
the terms of the L12 contract of 27 January 1995 applied.  Secondly, monthly
OSF charges were imposed pursuant to the Rules
of the Union.
<P>

13   	It is not in dispute that, whatever the arrangement was
between Ms Flood and the Union, it was a <i>"pre-Code continuing credit
contract"</i> as defined in reg 41.  The Tribunal so held.  The Tribunal held,
however, that the relevant credit contract was that executed on
27 January
1995, the L12 contract, and that the terms of that contract were set out in the
written document.  The Tribunal drew attention
to the principle that, where the
parties have executed a formal document, they are presumed to have expressed
all of the terms of
the contract.  The Tribunal held that the L12 Line of
Credit Loan constituted a credit transaction separate from the original
transaction
of joining the Union.  The Tribunal rejected the Union's submission
that the L12 transaction formed part of a single credit contract
which had a
number of components.  The Tribunal therefore went on to consider the issues
between the parties on the footing that
the terms set out in the L12 contract
of 27 January 1995 contained all the terms of the credit contract.  The
Tribunal applied the
terms of the Code accordingly.
<P>

14   	In my opinion, that approach was wrong in law.  The
Tribunal was considering a pre-Code continuing credit contract.  It was
necessary for the Tribunal to take into account all those arrangements between
the parties which, had the credit transaction been
entered into after the
coming into operation of the Code, should have been set out in the written
contract required by s 12.  It
was not necessary that a pre-Code continuing
credit contract be contained entirely in one document, or that it be entirely
documented.
<P>

15   	In my opinion, the OSF charge, which Ms Flood was bound to
pay, formed part of the arrangements between Ms Flood and the Union
with
respect to her credit loan and was a part of the pre-Code continuing credit
contract.  It was wrong for the Tribunal to proceed
on the footing that Ms
Flood was not bound to pay the OSF under a credit contract.  The OSF was not a
fee payable in respect of Ms
Flood's membership.  It was payable in respect of
the credit provided to her and it was a term of her credit arrangements.  Ms
Flood
was contractually bound to pay the OSF and, when the Union imposed the
monthly charge on her overdrawn credit account, it did so
in pursuance of its
contractual entitlement to do so.  The Code did not strike down that
contractual entitlement.  It was not held
by the Tribunal that the charge would
have offended any stipulation of the Code had it been contained in a written
contract.
<P>

16   	What was submitted to the Tribunal was that, as the OSF
was not a term of the L12 contract of 27 January 1995, it was to be
ignored.
The Tribunal accepted that submission and proceeded on the footing that, on the
coming into operation of the Code, the Union
was no longer entitled to charge
the OSF.  However, reg 41, which defines a <i>"pre-Code continuing credit
contract"</i>, does not specify the form in which that contract may be found.
Regulation 43(1) provides that the Code applies to the provision
of credit
under a pre-Code continuing credit contract but that the Code does not apply to
anything done or omitted to be done in
respect of the contract before the
deferred commencement date, which has been agreed as 16 November 1996.
Accordingly, whatever was
done before the commencement of the Code continued to
have validity and effect under the law under which it was done; but actions
taken after the commencement of the Code were required to comply with the
Code.
<P>

17   	If support is needed for the view that I have just
expressed that a pre-Code continuing credit contract continues in force
notwithstanding that it does not comply with ss 12 and 15, one finds support in
reg 48 which provides that, not later than three
months after the commencement
of the Code, the Union must give to the debtor the statements required by s 14
of the Code, which provides
for a pre-contractual statement setting out the
matters required by s 15 to be included in the contract document and an
information
statement in the form required by the regulations of the debtor's
statutory rights and statutory obligations.  On or about 18 December
1996, the
Union sent to all its members having an L12 contract, including the applicant,
a document which was intended, inter alia,
to comply with the requirements of
reg 48.  That document did not in fact refer to the OSF and, accordingly, there
would appear to
have been a breach of reg 48.  However, that was not an issue
raised before the Tribunal.
<P>

18   	I turn now to the breaches found by the Tribunal to have
occurred.
<P>

<b><u>Section 21(3)</u></b>
<P>

19   	This subsection reads:
<P>

<i>   (3)  A credit fee or charge cannot be charged in respect of a credit
contract unless the contract authorises it to be charged.</i>
<P>

20   	As a monthly OSF fee of $17.50 was imposed on Ms Flood's
overdrawn L12 account from 2 January 1997 onwards, and as the L12
contract of
27  January 1995 did not make reference to any such fee, the Tribunal found
that the Union had imposed a credit charge
in respect of a credit contract in
the circumstance that the credit contract had not authorised it to be charged.
The Tribunal accepted
that Ms Flood was contractually bound to pay the charge
and that the Union was entitled as a matter of contract to impose it but
considered that the pre-Code continuing credit contract did not authorise it to
be charged.
<P>

21   	I have already expressed my view that the Tribunal was
wrong in law in finding that the pre-Code continuing credit contract
was
comprised of the written agreement in which Ms Flood undertook, inter alia, not
to exceed the approved credit of $3,000 and charges
plus 1.330% of that total
amount and Ms Flood's agreement to abide by the Rules of the Union in
accordance with which the Union imposed
the OSF on overdrawn credit accounts.
Accordingly, the imposition of the OSF was authorised by the pre-Code
continuing credit contract.
<P>

22   	In the light of this conclusion, most of the other
breaches found by the Tribunal necessarily fail, but, as there has been
debate
about them, I should discuss them.  There are additional reasons why these
findings erred in law.
<P>

<b><u>Section 21(1)(b) and (c)</u></b>
<P>

23   	These provisions read:
<P>

<i> <b> 21</b>. (1) A credit contract must not impose a monetary liability on
the debtor-</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	in respect of an amount of a fee or charge exceeding the amount that may
be charged consistently with this Code; or</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	in respect of an interest charge under the contract exceeding the amount
that may be charged consistently with this Code.</i>
<P>

24   	The Tribunal found that, as the Union had charged a
monthly fee which the L12 contract had not authorised and as it charged
interest on the monthly balance which included the charge, the Union breached
both paragraphs (b) and (c).  No other basis for a
breach of these provisions
was found.
<P>

25   	In my opinion, it is not possible to base a breach of s
21(1) on a breach of s 21(3).  The two provisions speak of different
and
inconsistent matters.  Section 21(3) does not apply unless the contract does
not authorise the imposition of the subject fee
or charge.  Section 21(1)(b)
and (c) operates only when the contract imposes the relevant fee, charge or
interest.  As the Tribunal
found that the L12 contract did not authorise the
imposition of the OSF, the Tribunal ought to have rejected the submission that
there was a breach of s 21(1)(b).  Similarly, the Tribunal ought not to have
held that the contract imposed interest upon an invalid
charge.
<P>

<b><u>Section 32(B)</u></b>
<P>

26   	This provision reads:
<P>

<b><i>32</i></b><i>.  A statement of account must contain the following
matters-</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>(B)	<b>Balances</b>.</i>
<P>

<i>	The opening and closing balances (indicating the amount owed by the debtor
at the beginning and at the end of the statement period).</i>
<P>

27   	The Tribunal held that, as the Union had wrongly imposed
the monthly OSF charges on Ms Flood's L12 account, it had failed
to provide
statements of account which disclosed the opening and closing balances,
indicating the amounts owed by the debtor at the
beginning and end of each
statement period.  The Tribunal held that the balances shown were incorrect.
<P>

28   	In my opinion, s 32(B) is not concerned with any such
matter but rather with the provision of information showing the state
of the
debtor's account at the beginning and end of each statement period.  Such a
statement should reflect the state of the account
as reflected in the
creditor's, in this case the Union's, books of account.  Section 32(F) requires
particulars of any fees and charges
debited to the debtor's account during the
statement period and s 32(G) requires particulars of each amount credited to
the debtor
during the statement period and of payments debited to the account
during the statement period.  If, during the statement period,
a fee or charge
is wrongly charged to the account or a payment that ought to have been credited
into the account was not credited
or a payment that ought to have been debited
to the account was not debited, that matters not for the purposes of s 32(B).
The paragraph
requires information to be given as to how the account stands.
If a charge was debited or if an amount was credited or a payment
was debited
in fact, the statement must disclose this.  Only by a disclosure of what has
occurred can the debtor be fully informed
of the state of the account and
enabled to take remedial steps if not satisfied with the position.
<P>

29   	As the statements of account provided by the Union to Ms
Flood correctly recorded the entries to her account, including the
charges
debited to her account and the opening and closing balances as shown in the
Union's records, there was no breach of s 32(B).
<P>

<b><u>Section 32(E)</u></b>
<P>

30   	This provision reads:
<P>

<b><i>32</i></b><i>.  A statement of account must contain the following
matters-</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>(E)	<b>Interest charges.</b></i>
<P>

<i>(a)	The amount of the interest charge debited to the debtor's account during
the statement period and when the interest was debited.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	The annual percentage rate or rates and, if required by Part 4, details
of any change since the last statement period.</i>
<P>

31   	The Tribunal found that there had been a breach of this
provision.  However, as the Union's statements of account showed the
interest
debited to Ms Flood's account during the statement period, there was no breach.

<P>

<b><u>Section 32(I)</u></b>
<P>

32   	This provision reads:
<P>

<b><i>32</i></b><i>.  A statement of account must contain the following
matters-</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>(I)	<b>Insurance payments</b>.</i>
<P>

<i>If payment to an insurer is made during the statement period under a
credit-related insurance contract that is agreed to be financed
under the
credit contract-</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the name of the insurer, the amount paid to the insurer and the kind of
insurance;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	if the credit provider is aware of any commission to be paid by the
insurer in relation to the insurance contract - the amount
of the commission
expressed either as a monetary amount or as a proportion of the premium, if
ascertainable when the statement is
given;</i>
<P>

<i>(if not previously disclosed in accordance with this Code).</i>
<P>

33   	Ms Flood had entered into a policy of disability benefit
insurance which required payment of a fortnightly amount by way of
premium.  Ms
Flood became disabled and the disability benefit was paid to the maximum
available under the policy.  Ms Flood continued
the insurance cover even after
this time and so a debit of about $7 per month for <i>"DISABILITY COVER"</i>
appeared in each of her monthly statements.
<P>

34   	The information statement, sent in December 1996 to Ms
Flood and other members of the Union having an L12 contract, contained
the
information:
<P>

<i>"Insurer:	</i><cite>THE CUNA MUTUAL GROUP</cite>
<P>

<i>Type of Insurance:	</i><cite>SICKNESS AND ACCIDENT INSURANCE</cite>
<P>

<i>Period of Insurance Contract:	</i><cite>FOR THE DURATION OF THIS
FACILITY</cite>
<P>

<i>Premium Payable to Insurer:	</i><cite>17.5 CENTS/$100 DRAWN OR PART
THEREOF</cite>
<P>

<i>We will receive a commission for your insurance business 20% of the
premium"</i>
<P>

As I have already mentioned, the document in which that information was
contained was sent to the members in satisfaction of the
requirements of reg 48
which incorporates s 15 and, inter alia, paragraph (N) thereof which deals with
the particulars to be given
in relation to a credit-related insurance
contract.
<P>

35   	The information provided by the Union complied with the
information specified in s 15(N), save insofar as the description,
<i>"THE CUNA
MUTUAL GROUP",</i> did not adequately set out the name of the insurer.  The
"Certificate as to Insurance" described the policy of insurance as being
with
<i>"the CUNA Mutual Insurance Group"</i>.  Obviously, the precise company was
not named.  There may have been a technical breach of the Code but there was no
finding of the
Tribunal on that point and no penalty was imposed because of
it.
<P>

36   	Mr Forster submitted that, as the relevant information had
been disclosed to Ms Flood in accordance with the Code in the statement
supplied in accordance with reg 48, no breach of s 32(I) of the Code occurred.
Mr Bingham submitted that, as ss 14 and 15 of the
Code did not apply directly
to a pre-Code continuing credit contract, then the information had not been
previously disclosed in accordance
with the Code and that it was necessary that
the Union disclose the information in every monthly statement, as in fact
occurred in
statements issued to Ms Flood as from 15 October 1997.  I prefer Mr
Forster's interpretation of the Code.  I consider that s 32(I)
does not require
disclosure in each monthly statement and would be satisfied if the insurance
arrangements were disclosed in the
pre-contractual statement provided under s
14 and in the contract in accordance with s 15(N).  In my opinion, disclosure
in accordance
with the transitional reg 48, as occurred in the present case,
was a sufficient disclosure.
<P>

37   	The Tribunal said:
<P>

<i>"118.	The post-Code monthly statements of account were alleged to be
inaccurate, and therefore in contravention of s.32, in that the
statements did
not show the name of the insurer, the amount of commission in respect of
payment to an insurer and the minimum amount
payable under that agreement.
<b>The PDECU did not dispute those allegations</b>."</i>  (emphasis added)
<P>

It was submitted by Mr Bingham that the Tribunal proceeded on the footing that
there had been a concession of breach of s 32(I).
 I do not read the Tribunal's
reasons in that way.  In that passage, the Tribunal was merely stating that the
Union did not dispute
that the statements prior to 15 October 1997 did not show
the information of which s 32(I) speaks.
<P>

38   	The Tribunal said that, although the notice to members
sent out in December 1996 did include a disclosure of particulars in
the
insurance held in connection with the loans, the copies of statements of
account from November 1996 to September 1997 did not
contain this information.
On this basis, the Tribunal found that there was a breach of s 32(I).  In my
opinion, the Tribunal erred
in that the disclosure made in accordance with reg
48 was a relevant disclosure in accordance with the Code.  Therefore, there was
no breach of s 32(I).
<P>

39   	As a result, I am satisfied that the Tribunal erred in law
in all its findings of breach of the Code.  However, there are
still some
issues which were raised by Mr Forster which I should mention, as they were
debated before me.
<P>

<b><u>Section 7</u></b>
<P>

40   	This section reads, inter alia:
<P>

<b><i>7. (1) Short term credit</i></b><i>.  This Code does not apply to the
provision of credit limited by the contract to a total period not exceeding 62
days.</i>
<P>

<b><i>(2) Credit without prior agreement.</i></b><i>  This Code does not apply
to the provision of credit without prior agreement between the credit provider
and the debtor.  For example,
when a cheque account becomes overdrawn but there
is no agreed overdraft facility or when a savings account falls into
debit.</i>
<P>

41   	Mr Forster submitted that, as the L12 contract of 27
January 1995 provided in clause 2 that the total principal was <i>"repayable
immediately on demand"</i>, then, by reason of s 7(1), it was not a contract to
which the Code applied.  I reject that submission.  Section 7(1) refers to a
situation where the provision of credit is limited by the contract to a period
not exceeding 62 days.  There was nothing in the arrangement
between Ms Flood
and the Union which limited the provision of credit to a period not exceeding
62 days.  The period was not limited
by time; but the sum due could be called
up on demand.
<P>

42   	Mr Forster further submitted that, as Ms Flood had
expressly agreed in her contract of 27 January 1995 not to exceed the approved
line of credit, the provision of credit beyond this sum was a provision of
credit without prior agreement, within the meaning of
those words in s 7(2).
He put the point that credit over the agreed amount came about when cheques
were drawn and the Union, in its
discretion, paid them.  He submitted that such
a circumstance amounted to a provision of credit without prior agreement.
<P>

43   	I prefer Mr Bingham's exposition of s 7(2), which is that
it applies in only a very limited case, that is where there has
been no
relevant agreement for the provision of credit, such a circumstance being, for
example, where a member of a union, without
having arranged any credit
facility, overdraws on a savings account.
<P>

<b><u>Regulation 58</u></b>
<P>

44   	This regulation reads, inter alia:
<P>

<b><i>58(2)</i></b><i>	For the purposes of the Code, credit fees and charges do
not include any fees or charges that are payable to or by a credit provider
in
connection with a credit contract in connection with which both credit and
debit facilities are available <b>if the fees or charges would be payable even
if credit facilities were not available</b>.</i>  (emphasis added)
<P>

45   	Mr Forster relied upon this provision to submit that the
monthly OSF charges were exempt from the Code by reason that the
charges would
be payable even if credit facilities were not available.  Mr Forster submitted
that the monthly charge of $17.50 was
imposed on overdrawn accounts, whether
they be savings accounts or credit accounts.
<P>

46   	The L12 credit arrangement was one in respect of which
both debit and credit facilities were available.  The OSF applied to
a line of
credit overdrawn by $200 above the approved limit.  I have earlier set out this
provision.  Therefore, it was a charge
on a credit account, on an overdrawn
line of credit.  Therefore, reg 58(2) did not apply.  Regulation 58(2) looks to
fees and charges
which are payable whether or not a credit facility is
available.  The subject OSF charges were not of that character.  Transaction
charges which apply whether or not credit is available may have the stipulated
character.
<P>

<b><u>Conclusion</u></b>
<P>

47   	For these reasons, I am of the view that all parts of the
Tribunal's determination, declaration and orders, other than paragraphs
1 and 7
of the determination, should be set aside.  The parties may apply, within ten
days, for consequential orders including orders
with respect to costs.
