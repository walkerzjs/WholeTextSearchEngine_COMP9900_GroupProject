<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  The plaintiff by notice of motion filed 8 August 1996 seeks
an extension of time within which to commence proceedings pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 60G</a>
and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">60I</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b> 1969.  The plaintiff relied on his
affidavit sworn 16 October 1998.  The defendant did not rely on any affidavit
evidence.  The defendant
opposes the orders sought. 
<P>

2	I observed the plaintiff carefully when he gave evidence and was
cross-examined.  I formed the opinion that he was recounting
the events as he
remembered them although his recollection was inconsistent on three topics
namely, firstly, how he found his way
to Ms Beck for counselling;  secondly,
the mechanism by which he was referred to Dr Kemp and thirdly, the timing of
the appointments
with Ms Beck.  However, these inconsistencies do not lead me
to doubt the rest of his evidence.  I accept 
<P>

that he was telling the truth in relation to his understanding of his
psychiatric condition. When the plaintiff had to give evidence
about his
emotions he became hesitant.  At one stage when he was giving evidence he
became visibly upset.
<P>

3	For the purposes of this application I find the following facts.
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff was born on 2 January 1946 and currently resides in Western
Australia.
<P>

(2)	On 11 February 1963 the plaintiff became a member of the Royal Australian
Navy.  He enlisted for an initial term of 9 years.
 He was at that stage 17
years old and in good physical and psychiatric health.  He was happy and looked
forward to a long career
in the Navy.  He would go out to dances, play cricket
and football.  He did not drink or smoke prior to joining the Navy.
<P>

(3)	On 10 February 1964 the plaintiff was a crew member of the aircraft carrier
HMAS Melbourne (Melbourne).  On that day the Melbourne
was involved in joint
exercises with the escort destroyer HMAS Voyager (Voyager).
<P>

(4)	On 10 February 1964 at approximately 2056 hours Eastern Standard time a
collision occurred between the aircraft carrier HMAS
Melbourne and the
destroyer Voyager at sea about 20 miles south east of Jervis Bay.  Eighty two
men from the Voyager lost their lives
in the collision.  
<P>

(5)	At the time of the collision the plaintiff was in the mess in 3 deck
for'ard of midships.  He was not on duty and about to watch
a movie.  Suddenly
he was thrown onto the deck by a jolt.  The plaintiff in a panic rushed up the
ladder to the flight deck to see
the stern of the Voyager going down past the
Melbourne starboard side and going behind floundering in the ocean.  He was
terrified
and filled with horror and fear as he thought the Melbourne was going
to sink.  He was frozen in shock as he was transfixed watching
the aft section
of the Voyager.  There were floodlights operating from the Melbourne onto the
water and boats were put into the water
to rescue the Voyager crewmen.  He
began to shout in panic to the Voyager crewmen to get on the ship as he was
afraid for the men
in the water and for himself as he thought the Melbourne
might sink.  He shouted to the crew on the Voyager as he thought that the
Melbourne might sink.  Someone struck him in the chest to quieten him down.
<P>

(6)	The plaintiff was asked to go up to the bow to clean up debris from the
Voyager.  He was asked to bring a light.  He saw a set
of human brains and a
crewman from the sick bay was called and the brains were placed in a container.
The plaintiff became very distressed
and vomited.  He saw crew from the Voyager
being brought on board the Melbourne and placed in the hangar deck area.  He
did not know
if they were dead or alive.  He heard screaming and yelling and he
went to the gangway area to try and 
<P>

assist but was told to "bugger off" which caused him to feel helpless and
rejected.  He saw the stern sink and cried.  He felt confused,
anxious and
distressed.  He smoked continually all night to try and calm down.  He did not
sleep. 
<P>

(7)	The plaintiff remembers going into Sydney harbour but the majority of the
trip is a blank.  He remembers being told not to talk
or discuss the collision
with anyone.  He saw the survivors being taken off and placed into ambulances.
When he went ashore he was
abused by the public and called a "murderer" and
"killer" and he got drunk and into a fight.  He felt terrible about being
accused
of being a killer.
<P>

(8)	As he was told not to discuss the incident with anyone he was unable to
talk about it with his family even when they bombarded
him with questions.  He
received no counselling and as he had comrades on the Voyager with whom he
drank and socialised, he decided
to help take up a collection for the Voyager
crew.  The next thing he recalled was a civilian and the police coming up to
him and
accusing him of collecting funds falsely.  He went to the police
station and the police said there were no problems and let him go.
 The
plaintiff then travelled back to Melbourne and when he arrived the shore patrol
took him into custody for falsely collecting
funds under false pretences.  The
Captain dismissed the matter but the plaintiff felt confused and betrayed. 
<P>

(9)	Between the Voyager collision and discharge, the plaintiff was on vessels
which served in Vietnam for one day and the Malacca
Strait.  On 5 July, 1966
the plaintiff was discharged from the navy as a consequence of an injury he
suffered to his right knee while
playing service rugby.  As a result of this
injury the plaintiff was no longer able to climb ladders.  He made a claim for
workers
compensation from the Defence Department but did not receive any
payments.
<P>

(10)	The plaintiff says that immediately after the collision he increased his
smoking to try and calm his nerves.  Prior to the
collision he smoked between 5
to 12 cigarettes some days.  Some days when he was on duty he would smoke less
or none at all and some
days when he was on leave he would smoke up to a
maximum of 20 or one packet.  While drinking and socialising after the
collision
this increased to 40 cigarettes per day and sometimes up to 60 per
day.  This increased to 60 per day in 1966.  The plaintiff gave
up smoking in
1987.
<P>

(11)	During the period between the Voyager collision and when the plaintiff was
discharged from the Navy he was fearful and looking
for a collision to occur.
He became anxious near water and became claustrophobic.  The events of the
collision would flood back through
his mind.  He had flashbacks.  He says that
he was irritable, restless and his confidence and self-esteem were low.  He was
angry
and depressed.  After leaving the Navy he obtained a job as a storeman
but this only lasted about 6 weeks as he had problems dealing
with people and
could not control his emotions particularly his anger.  He travelled from place
to place doing manual jobs and not
staying in a particular job long as he was
unable to cope with authority.  He wandered from place to place to get away
from life.
 He was a changed person unable to cope with ordinary
responsibilities of work, was stressed, mistrustful of his bosses and felt
fear
at being placed in dangerous situations.  He went to Kings Cross and was
drinking very heavily and getting into fights.
<P>

(12)	In 1970 the plaintiff married.  He continued to binge drink, was moody and
angry.  He continued to have problems sleeping and
had nightmares and
distressing memories of the collision which were part of his daily life.  On
occasions he would find himself sitting
down and suddenly he would be back in
the aftermath of the collision - yelling out to the men to get off the Voyager
and flashes
of finding the brain and other scenes of that night.  If he saw
anything on the television news concerning accidents he would cry
and become
distressed.  Since the collision he has been unable to make any close
friendship as he is unable to mix with people. 
He cannot show any emotion to
his children although he loves them.  He feels different and is unable to get
close to his wife and
they often argue.  He is still unable to discuss with
anyone including his wife the collision and its aftermath.  
<P>

(13)	For years he drank in binges as a means of escape.  The plaintiff ceased
to smoke in 1987 and although he realised that he
was a changed man since the
collision he was unaware that he had a psychiatric illness.  He thought he was
trying to cope in what
he saw as a normal person would do.  
<P>

(14)	Between 1978 and 1985 the plaintiff operated a retail tyre service at Lake
Grace.  The business was going broke so on the advice
of accountants, the
plaintiff closed the business down.  In 1985 the plaintiff gained employment
with "Schraeder Automotive" as a
sales representative.  He slipped out of the
back of a truck and fractured his right femur.  It was nearly five years until
the plaintiff
was able to walk again.  While he was in a lot of pain, took
panadol forte and felt useless around the house, he did not consider
that this
injury affected his emotional state but conceded that it made him feel
aggressive and frustrated because he was asked to
do things which he could not
do.
<P>

(15)	From 1987 for 5 years, the plaintiff received a pension from the Defence
Force Retirement Fund (DFRDP) and workers compensation
from his employer
Schraeder Automotive.  
<P>

(16)	In 1991 the plaintiff found himself crying for no apparent reason.  He did
not realise that he had a psychiatric illness nor
did he know it was related to
the collision.  About this time he heard on an ABC radio program that
counselling was available to
Vietnam veterans.  While in the Navy the plaintiff
had served on a vessel in Vietnam waters in 1965.  He telephoned and spoke to
a
counsellor several times who referred him to a counsellor by the name of Jean
Beck.  He understood that Ms Beck was a marriage
counsellor.  He consulted her
because he was aware he was pushing his wife and children away when they came
to console him and he
did not know why he was doing so.  Ms Beck, at these
consultations, told the plaintiff that she was a Vietnam Veteran counsellor.
As to whether he found his way to her as a marriage guidance counsellor or a
Vietnam veteran counsellor the plaintiff stated it was
as a Vietnam veteran
counsellor.  However at the first consultation there was a sign in the
reception of the office saying that Ms
Beck was a marriage counsellor.  I
accept that the plaintiff was initially seeking advice for his marriage
problems and it became
known to the plaintiff that Ms Beck wore two hats so to
speak, namely that of a marriage counsellor and that of a Vietnam veteran
counsellor.
<P>

(17)	The plaintiff's evidence was that he consulted Ms Beck about 6 times.  He
thought it was for a period of 12 months but could
not be sure.  Ms Beck's
records showed that the plaintiff consulted her in 1991 twice and 1992 and
twice in 1994 the last appointment
being 24 March 1994.  I accept that Ms
Beck's records are correct and that the plaintiff's recollection as to the time
when the last
consultation took place was incorrect.  When the plaintiff
consulted Ms Beck he related his difficulties with drinking, smoking and
attitude to his children to his service in Vietnam and Indo China.   At the
last consultation he recollected that Ms Beck provided
him with a referral to
Dr Kemp, psychiatrist.  
<P>

(18)	It was Dr Peterkin the plaintiff's general practitioner who referred the
plaintiff to Dr Kemp for post traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) on 26 May 1995
(Ex C).  The plaintiff was mistaken in his belief that Ms Beck referred him to
Dr Kemp.  However, I infer that
she told the plaintiff to see his general
practitioner for a referral.  The plaintiff told Dr Peterkin that he had been
breaking
down and crying since 1991 and because of the way things were going at
home he needed to talk to someone else.  He conceded that
it is possible he
told Dr Peterkin the above in 1991.  It is the plaintiff's evidence that
neither Dr Peterkin nor Ms Beck had referred
to PTSD prior to 26 May 1995.  
<P>

(19)	In June 1995 Ms Beck wrote to Dr Kemp.  She acknowledged that the
plaintiff was referred to her by Dr Peterkin for a "stress
related disorder".
She wrote that the plaintiff still experienced severe stress and anxiety
related to his time on the Melbourne
and the other two serious accidents which
occurred during his service and that his PTSD had impacted on his quality of
life and his
family relationships causing him both physical and emotional
suffering.
<P>

(20)	At the second consultation with Dr Kemp which occurred about mid 1995 the
plaintiff was first made aware by Dr Kemp that he
was suffering from a
psychiatric illness namely PTSD as a consequence of the collision between the
Melbourne and the Voyager.  Dr
Kemp also diagnosed that the plaintiff over the
past 12 months had developed major depression and symptoms of PTSD have been
the
major precipitating factors of its onset.
<P>

(21)	On 25 November the plaintiff gave his solicitors an Authority to Act.  The
plaintiff gave evidence that prior to 8 August 1996
he had heard that there was
a successful claim by Mr McLean and Mr McLean had been aboard the Melbourne and
that personnel from the
Melbourne could claim for compensation (t 31).
<b><u>McLean v The Commonwealth of Australia</u></b> (NSWSC, unreported 28 June
1996) was heard by Sperling J June  1996.
<P>

(22)	In February 1996 the plaintiff was informed by Dr Mark Hands a
cardiologist that he suffered from obstructive coronary artery
angioplasty.  He
has since been made aware that his heart condition was caused or severely
aggravated by his previous heavy smoking
of up to 60 cigarettes per day.  Dr
Kemp in his report dated 20 October 1997 stated that it is generally accepted
in medical circles
that substance abuse and tobacco smoking can be associated
with psychiatric conditions such as post traumatic stress disorder and
can be
viewed as a form of self medication or self treatment to attempt to alleviate
unpleasant emotional symptoms associated with
the disorder.  According to Dr
Kemp it also seemed accepted in the general medical literature that cigarette
smoking is associated
with cardiovascular ischaemia. 
<P>

(23)	On 22 February 1996 the Defence Centre Perth advised that liability had
been admitted under the Compensation Act for PTSD.
<P>

(24)	On 8 August, 1996 the statement of claim and notice of motion seeking an
extension of the limitation period was filed.
<P>

(25)	On 3 November 1997 Dr Peterkin wrote to the plaintiff's solicitor and
stated that to his knowledge the diagnosis of PTSD was
not made until the
plaintiff visited Dr Kemp on 19 June 1995.
<P>

(26)	On 9 March 1999 Ms Beck wrote to the plaintiff's solicitor and stated that
the plaintiff was referred to her by his general
practitioner for marital and
relationship counselling when she was a co-ordinator of Relationships Australia
(WA) INC Bunberry.
<P>

<b><u>The Law</u></b>
<P>

4	The plaintiff relies on s 58(2) , 60G and 60I of the Limitations Act, 1969.
The parties agreed that this is the applicable law.
The approach to be adopted
in dealing with applications for the extension of limitation periods, is that
which has been expounded
in recent times in <b><u>Brisbane South Regional
Health Authority v Taylor</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186 CLR 541</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=139%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">139 ALR 1</a> and in
<b><u>BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Limited v Giudice (&amp; Ors)</u></b> (Court of
Appeal, unreported, 7 March 1997).  The onus rests with the applicant.  
<P>

5	Section 58(2) provides for the extension of the limitation period in respect
of a cause of action founded on negligence, nuisance
or breach of duty for
damages for personal injury.  Section 58(2) provides as follows:
<P>

	<b>"Where, on application to a court by a person claiming to have a cause of
action to which this section applies, it appears to the
court that:-</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	any of the material facts of a decisive character relating to the cause
of action was not within the means of knowledge of the
applicant until a date
after the commencement of the year preceding the expiration of the period of
limitation for the cause of action;
 and</b>
<P>

<b>	(b)	there is evidence to establish the right of action, apart from a
defence founded on the expiration of a limitation period,</b>
<P>

<b>	the court may order that the period of limitation for the action be
extended so that it expires at the end of 1 year after that date..."</b>
<P>

6	The power thus granted to the court to extend the limitation period is
limited to a power to extend that period only until a date
one year after the
date upon which the plaintiff became aware of the last of the material facts
necessary to be known by him.  The
date upon which the plaintiff in fact became
aware of the material facts is thus of vital importance in this case, where the
original
motion for extension of time in respect of a cause of action was not
filed until 8 August, 1996.  The plaintiff cannot succeed under
s 58 unless he
can show that he was unaware of all necessary material facts until a date after
the 8 August 1995.  
<P>

7	In practical terms, the plaintiff, to open the way to an exercise of the
court's discretion under this subdivision of the Act,
must identify one or more
"material facts of a decisive character relating to the cause of action";
prove (by evidence) that that
fact or one or more of these facts was unknown to
him and not within his means of knowledge as at 10 February 1970 (the last
expiration
date of the relevant limitation period);  and either show (by
evidence) on what date (being a date after 8 August 1995) that fact
(or the
last of those facts to become known to him)  became known to him (or came
within his means of knowledge) or, at the least,
show that one such fact was
still not known to him as at 8 August 1995.
<P>

8	A material fact relating to a cause of action includes the nature and extent
of the personal injury so caused - see s 57B(1)(b)(iv).
 Section 57B(1)(c)
states that facts are of decisive character if, but only if, a reasonable man
knowing those facts and having taken
appropriate advice on those facts would
regard those facts as showing that an action on the cause of action would have
a reasonable
prospect of success and resulting in an award of damages
sufficient to justify the bringing of an action.
<P>

9	The application of s 58(2) involves a three step process.  The first step is
to inquire whether the facts of which the appellant
was unaware were material
facts:  s 57(1)(b).  If they were, the next step is to ascertain whether they
were of a decisive character:
 s 57(1)(c).  If so, then it must be ascertained
whether those facts were within the means of knowledge of the appellant before
the
specified date:  s 58(2). 
<P>

10	The plaintiff submitted that he was unaware of the nature and extent of his
personal injury until 1996 when he was told that
he suffered from obstructive
coronary artery angioplasty. The defendant submitted that the plaintiff knew
that he suffered from PTSD
in 1991 and that the artery condition cannot stand
alone and that it must be linked to PTSD. 
<P>

11	After the plaintiff left the Navy in 1966 he was irritable, restless, angry
and depressed.  He was anxious and expecting another
collision to occur.  He
was anxious and claustrophobic.  He had flashbacks.  His confidence and self
esteem were low.  He drank heavily
and could not hold down a job.  Instead of
smoking a maximum of 20 cigarettes per day this increased until the plaintiff
was smoking
up to 60 per day.  By 1970 it would seem that he was no longer
expecting another collision to occur but the other problems continued.
 By now
the plaintiff was aware that he had problems sleeping and was unable to form
close friendships or show emotion.  He was still
binge drinking and smoking.
However, at this time which falls at the end of the limitation period the
plaintiff was unaware that
he had a psychiatric illness.  By 1978 the plaintiff
had married and had regular employment in his own business but the problems
outlined above continued except that in 1987 the plaintiff gave up smoking.  In
1991 the plaintiff became aware that he was crying
for no apparent reason and
he may well have told Dr Peterkin of these symptoms.  However the plaintiff did
not realise that he had
a psychiatric illness nor was he aware that his
behaviour was related to the collision.  I accept the plaintiff's evidence that
Ms
Beck and Dr Peterkin did not tell him that he suffered from PTSD prior to 26
May 1995.  This was confirmed by both Ms Beck and Dr
Peterkin.  It was in mid
1995 during the second consultation with Dr Kemp that the plaintiff was made
aware that he was suffering
from a psychiatric illness namely chronic PTSD and
that this illness was connected to the collision between the Melbourne and the
Voyager.  The plaintiff was unaware that he had developed major depression
precipitated by the symptoms of PTSD until he was advised
of this by Dr Kemp.
He was unaware of the nature and extent of his personal injury and the fact
that the breach of duty caused personal
injury.  As the plaintiff obtained this
knowledge prior to 8 August 1995, he falls outside the time stipulated in s
58(2) in relation
to his claim for PTSD and major depression.
<P>

12	However the plaintiff did not know that he suffered from obstructive artery
angioplasty which was caused or severely aggravated
by the previous history of
smoking up to 60 cigarettes per day until he was told this by Dr Hands in
February 1996.  The plaintiff's
evidence is that he increased his smoking from
a maximum of 20 per day to 60 per day after the collision to soothe and relax
him
when he was feeling tense.  However, even if this knowledge was obtained in
1996 within the time period stipulated by s 58(2) does
it constitute a material
fact?  There is medical opinion that the plaintiff's increased tobacco smoking
can be associated with PTSD
and can be viewed as a form of self medication or
self treatment to attempt to alleviate emotional symptoms associated with the
disorder
and that smoking was a significant contribution to the plaintiff's
development of obstructive coronary artery disease.
<P>

13	Certainly, obstructive coronary artery disease is a different condition to
PTSD.  There was no mention of the plaintiff's smoking
habits in Dr Kemp's
report dated 10 June 1996.  The plaintiff would have been unaware that his
smoking was linked to PTSD until he
saw Dr Kemp's report of 20 October 1997.
Even though the plaintiff was aware he suffered from PTSD and major depression
in mid 1995,
he was not aware that his increased smoking was linked to the
collision nor that it would lead to obstructive coronary artery disease.
 The
likely future course of PTSD does not include a diagnosis of obstructive
coronary artery disease.  It is my view that this disease
constitutes a
"material fact" but is it of a decisive character?
<P>

14	The plaintiff has not explained the events that led him to give up smoking
in 1987.  By mid 1995 the plaintiff already knew that
he had suffered PTSD and
it was linked to the collision.  He knew that he had a cause of action with
reasonable prospects of success
which would result in an award of damages
sufficient to justify the bringing of an action.  It is my view the additional
diagnosis
of coronary artery disease is not a material fact of a decisive
character.  The plaintiff has not satisfied the requirements of s
58(2) and
this claim fails.
<P>

15	Section 60G empowers the court to extend the limitation period, if it is
just and reasonable to do so, "for such period as it
determines".
<P>

16	The relevant provisions of s 60I are as follows:
<P>

	<b>"(1)	A court may not make an order under s 60G or 60H unless it is
satisfied that:</b>
<P>

<b> (a)	the plaintiff:</b>
<P>

<b>  (i)	did not know that personal injury had been suffered;  or</b>
<P>

<b> (ii)	was unaware of the nature or extent of personal injury suffered;
or</b>
<P>

<b>(iii)	was unaware of the connection between the personal injury and the
defendant's act or omission,</b>
<P>

	<b>at the expiration of the relevant limitation period or at a time before
that expiration when proceedings might reasonably have been
instituted;
and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the application is made within three years after the plaintiff became
aware (or ought to have become aware) of all three matters
listed in paragraph
(a)(i)-(iii)."</b>
<P>

17	Thus to gain access to the beneficial provisions of s 60G, the plaintiff
must show that:
<P>

(1)	As at 10 February 1970 (the expiration of the relevant limitation period)
he was unaware of one or more of the matters identified
in s 60I (1)(a)(i),
(ii) or (iii);
<P>

(2)	That he did not become aware of that or those or he ought to have become
aware in s 60I (1)(a) (or the last of those matters
to become known to him)
earlier than 5 February 1993.
<P>

	
<P>

18	The practical effect is to require the plaintiff to identify specifically
what fact or facts he claims not to have known as at
10 February 1970, which
lack of knowledge meets the description in one or more of paragraphs (i), (ii)
and (iii) of s 60I (1)(a);
 and to show (by evidence) the date on which he
acquired knowledge thereof (being a date later than 5 February 1993);  or to
show
that that fact was or those facts were still unknown to him on that date.
The defendant did not submit that the plaintiff ought to
have become aware of
the matters listed in paragraphs (i)-(iii) at an earlier date - see s 60I
(1)(b). 
<P>

19	The plaintiff relies on s 60I (1)(a)(i) and (ii) The plaintiff submitted
that he was unaware that he suffered the psychiatric
condition of PTSD until
1995 and he was also unaware that he suffered from an obstructive coronary
artery disease until February
1996.  The defendant submitted that the plaintiff
knew that he suffered from symptoms which could only be psychiatric in nature
in
1991. The defendant also submitted that the artery disease cannot stand
alone but must be linked to the PTSD.
<P>

<b>(i)	<u>Whether the plaintiff has proved that "he did not know that a
personal injury had been suffered</u>"</b>
<P>

20	As previously stated after the plaintiff left the Navy in 1966 he was
irritable, restless, angry and depressed.  He was anxious
and expecting another
collision to occur.  He was claustrophobic.  He had flashbacks.  His confidence
and self esteem were low. 
He drank heavily and could not hold down a job.
Instead of smoking a maximum of 20 cigarettes per day this had increased until
the
plaintiff was smoking 60 cigarettes per day.  By 1970 it would seem that he
was no longer expecting another collision to occur but
the other problems
continued.  In addition the plaintiff continued to have problems sleeping and
was unable to form close friendships
or show emotion.  He was still binge
drinking.  However, at this time which falls at the end of the limitation
period the plaintiff
was unaware that he had a psychiatric illness.  By 1978
the plaintiff had married and had regular employment in his own business.
 In
1987 the plaintiff gave up smoking.  
<P>

21	In 1991 the plaintiff was aware that he was crying for no apparent reason
and he may well have told Dr Peterkin of these symptoms
in 1991.  However the
plaintiff did not realise that he had a psychiatric illness nor was he aware
that his behaviour was related
to the collision. While the plaintiff was aware
of his symptoms he was unaware that he was suffering from a psychiatric illness
namely
chronic PTSD and that this illness was connected to the collision
between the Melbourne and the Voyager until he was so advised by
Dr Kemp in mid
1995.  The plaintiff was unaware that he had developed major depression
precipitated by the symptoms of PTSD until
he was advised by Dr Kemp of this.
I am satisfied that the plaintiff did not know that he had suffered injury
until mid 1995.  As
the plaintiff obtained this knowledge within the period
stipulated by s 60I (1)(b) he has satisfied the provisions of s 60I
(1)(a)(i).
<P>

<b>(ii)</b>	<b><u>Whether the plaintiff has proved that he was "unaware of
the</u></b> 	<b><u>nature or extent of the personal injury suffered</u>"</b>
<P>

22	The test of knowledge posed by s 60I (1)(a)(ii) requires the court to look
at the actual awareness of the plaintiff.  Neither
the reasonableness of that
awareness nor constructive knowledge is an element of s 60I (1)(a) -
(<b><u>Harris v Commercial Minerals Limited</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%2d96%29%20186%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995-96) 186 CLR 1</a> at pp 9
and 10).  <b><u>Harris</u></b> is a case of a disease of gradual onset.
<P>

23	The nature and extent of the injury which the plaintiff has sustained is to
be determined as an objective fact as at the date
of the hearing of the
application.  A plaintiff may be held to have been aware of the nature or
extent of his injury within the relevant
period if during that period he was
aware of the effect which the injury was then having upon him and of its likely
future course,
even though he may have been unaware of the precise pathology or
medical diagnosis.  In particular if the applicant was aware that
the injury
would deteriorate, he or she may be aware of the extent of the injury for the
purpose of s 60I (1)(a)(ii) even though
the injury developed particular
consequences that the applicant did not precisely foresee.  As long as the
consequences are of a
kind that an applicant expects, the applicant will be
aware of the extent of the injury (<b><u>Harris</u></b> pp 13 and 14).
<P>

24	I have referred to the state of the plaintiff's knowledge prior to the
limitation period under the heading s 60I (1)(a)(i). 
For the reasons given
there I am satisfied that although the plaintiff knew the symptoms he
experienced, he was unaware that he had
developed identifiable psychiatric
conditions of major depression and chronic PTSD until he was advised of this by
Dr Kemp in mid
1995. 
<P>

25	If I am wrong in this, it is my view that even though the plaintiff knew
that he suffered PTSD and chronic depression in mid
1995, the likely future
course of PTSD does not include a diagnosis of obstructive coronary heart
disease.  While the plaintiff has
not explained the reasons why he gave up
smoking in 1987 and those reasons may have been because he was warned about
specific dangers
to his health including the development of coronary heart
disease.  I accept that the plaintiff did not know that he had developed
obstructive coronary heart disease until February 1996.  It is my view that he
did not know the nature or extent of his injury until
February 1996.  The
plaintiff has passed through the s 60I (1)(a)(ii) gateway.
<P>

<b><u>Just and reasonable</u></b>
<P>

26	I turn now to consider whether it is just and reasonable to extend the
limitation period.  The nature of the discretion conferred
by s 31(2) of the
<b>Queensland Limitations Act</b> was considered by the High Court in
<b><u>Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186 CLR
541</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=139%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">139 ALR 1.</a>  Section 31(2) is almost identical to s 58(2) of the New South
Wales <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a>.</b>  The Court of Appeal has applied
<b><u>Taylor</u></b> in relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> in <b><u>BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Limited
v Giudice</u></b>;  <b><u>Commonwealth of Australia v McLean</u></b> (1997) 14
NSWLR p 389.
<P>

27	Firstly, I turn to consider whether the plaintiff has a real case to
advance.  In relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a>, the applicant bears an evidentiary and
persuasive onus which, in the absence of concession, requires material to be
adduced which
demonstrates that the dilatory plaintiff has a real case to
advance.  The need for the court to decide that it is just and reasonable
to
extend the limitation period must focus attention on the question whether there
is indeed evidence to establish the plaintiff's
cause of action.  It would
rarely be possible to say that it was just and reasonable to subject the
defendant to litigation otherwise
statute barred if it did not appear that
there was evidence available to the plaintiff to establish his cause of action.
(See <b><u>Szerdahelyi v Bailey</u></b> (unreported Badgery-Parker J, 1 May
1997);  <b><u>Ortado v Bailey</u></b> (unreported, Badgery-Parker J, 1 May
1997);  <b><u>Lewis v Bailey</u></b> (unreported, Badgery-Parker J, 1 May
1997);  <b><u>Council of the City of Sydney v Zegarac</u></b> (unreported,
NSWCA, 26 February 1998) and <b><u>Dow Corning Australia Pty Ltd v
Paton</u></b>, <b><u>Meares v Paton</u></b> (unreported NSW Court of Appeal, 24
April 1998) and <b><u>Fitzgerald v Bankstown City Council</u></b> (unreported
Court of Appeal, 6 November 1995).  
<P>

28	The defendant did not concede that the plaintiff had a real cause of action
but did not make any submissions on this point. 
The plaintiff was employed by
the defendant.  The defendant as employer of the plaintiff had a duty of care
to the plaintiff.  The
foreseeability of the plaintiff's damage will be in
issue at the trial.  It is the plaintiff's contention that as a result of his
experience of being on board the Melbourne when it was hit by the Voyager he
suffered post traumatic stress disorder.  He saw the
collision, he shouted out
to those on the Voyager and someone struck him in the chest to quieten him
down.  He saw crew from the
Voyager being brought on deck.  He did not know
whether they were alive or dead.  There is medical evidence to support that the
plaintiff
suffers from PTSD and his heart condition was aggravated by previous
heavy smoking.  The plaintiff's evidence is after the collision
he smoked up to
60 cigarettes per day to relax.  There is evidence to link these conditions to
the collision - See <b><u>Commonwealth of Australia v McLean</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2014%20NSWLR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 14
NSWLR 389.</a>
<P>

29	I turn now to <b><u>Taylor's</u></b> case.  In <b><u>Taylor</u></b> McHugh J
referred to the effects of delay in the now often quoted passage which
states:
<P>

	<b>"The effect of delay on the quality of justice is no doubt one of the most
important influences motivating a legislature to enact
limitation periods for
commencing actions.  But it is not the only one.  Courts and commentators have
perceived four broad rationales
for the enactment of limitation periods.
First, as time goes by, relevant evidence is likely to be lost.  Second, it is
oppressive,
even "cruel", to a defendant to allow an action to be brought long
after the circumstances which gave rise to it have passed.  Third,
people
should be able to arrange their affairs and utilise their resources on the
basis that claims can no longer be made against
them.  Insurers, public
institutions and businesses, particularly limited liability companies, have a
significant interest in knowing
that they have no liabilities beyond a definite
period."</b>
<P>

and;
<P>

<b>	"Legislatures enact limitation periods because they make a judgment, inter
alia, that the chance of an unfair trial occurring after
the limitation period
has expired is sufficiently great to require the termination of the plaintiff's
right of action at the end
of that period.  When a defendant is able to prove
that he or she will not now be able to fairly defend him or herself or that
there
is a significant chance that this is so, the case is no longer one of
presumptive prejudice.  The defendant has then proved what
the legislature
merely presumed would be the case.  Even on the hypothesis of presumptive
prejudice, the legislature perceives that
society is best served by barring the
plaintiff's action.  When actual prejudice of a significant kind is shown, it
is hard to conclude
that the legislature intended that the extension provision
should trump the limitation period.</b>
<P>

<b>	In such a situation, actual injustice to one party must occur.  It seems
more in accord with the legislative policy underlying limitation
periods that
the plaintiff's lost right should not be revived than that the defendant should
have a spent liability reimposed upon
it."</b>
<P>

30	Dawson J, in <b><u>Taylor</u></b> said at page 2:
<P>

	<b>"The applicant must establish that the commencement of an action beyond the
limitation period would not result in significant prejudice
to the prospective
defendant."</b>
<P>

and;
<P>

	<b>"The onus of satisfying the court that the discretion should be exercised
in favour of an applicant lies on the applicant.  To discharge
that onus the
applicant must establish that the commencement of an action beyond the
limitation period would not result in significant
prejudice to the prospective
defendant. I agree with McHugh J that, once the legislature has selected a
limitation period, to allow
the commencement of an action outside that period
is  prima facie prejudicial to the defendant who would otherwise have the
benefit
of the limitation."</b>
<P>

31	He continues:
<P>

	<b>"The discretion to extend should therefore be seen as requiring the
applicant to show that his or her case is a justifiable exception
to the rule
that the welfare of the State is best served by the limitation period in
question: Accordingly, when an applicant seeks
an extension of time to commence
an action after a limitation period has expired, he or she has the positive
burden of demonstrating
that the justice of the case requires an
extension."</b>
<P>

32	In <b><u>The Council of the City of Sydney v Zegarac</u></b> (Court of
Appeal, 3 September 1997, unreported) the Court of Appeal considered the effect
of <b><u>Taylor</u></b> in relation to the extension of the limitation period
of a case which falls into subdivision 2 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act 1969</a> - <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60c.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 60C</a>
and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60e.html" class="autolink_findacts">60E</a>.  
<P>

33	Mason P analysed the views of the Judges of the High Court in
<b><u>Taylor's</u></b> case.  The President quoted the passage by McHugh J
which begins "Legislatures enact" and was of the view that Dawson J agreed with

<P>

McHugh J.  Mason P concluded that it could therefore be seen that Dawson J and
McHugh JA appeared to indicate that it is mandatory
that the applicant negate
"significant prejudice" before the discretion could be exercised in his or her
favour. 
<P>

34	Toohey and Gummow JJ (in their joint judgment) expressed themselves in the
following terms.
<P>

	<b>"The real question is whether the delay has made the chances of a fair
trial unlikely.  If it has not there is no reason why the discretion
should not
be exercised in favour of the respondent."</b>
<P>

35	Mason P perceived that there may be a distinction between the notion of
"significant prejudice" and the notion that delay makes
"the chances of a fair
trial unlikely".  In determining whether it is just and reasonable to extend
the limitation period in this
application I will examine whether the delay has
made "the chances of a fair trial unlikely" or whether the defendants would
suffer
"significant prejudice".
<P>

36	The defendant has admitted the collision but denied it was negligent.  I
accept that with the passing of 34 years, there is the
real possibility that
some witnesses may not be available to give evidence at the trial.  It can also
be expected that memories will
have faded with the effluxion of time and some
witnesses may no longer be alive or able to be located.   Indisputably there is
presumptive
prejudice. However the defendant did not furnish evidence to
demonstrate that it suffers from actual prejudice. 
<P>

37	Generally speaking, the lengthy delay may well confront the defendant with a
difficult task in investigating a claim for damages.
 There are navy records
showing that at the time that the plaintiff joined the navy he was in good
physical and psychological health.
 The events surrounding the collision
between the Melbourne and Voyager are well known and there is documentary
evidence available
- see <b><u>McLean v The Commonwealth of Australia</u></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%2d97%29%2041%20NSWLR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996-97) 41 NSWLR 389</a> and <b><u>Lynch v The Commonwealth of Australia</u></b>
(Master Harrison, unreported 16 October 1998).  There are also decisions in
relation to extension of time of the limitation period
for Voyager/Melbourne
claims by Master Malpass.  In the case before me there are more recent records
of Ms Beck, Doctors Kemp, Peterkin
and Hand available.  These doctors are
available to give evidence.  The plaintiff is not seeking damages for physical
injury although
the effect of his serious knee injury on his psychological
health will be an issue in this case.
<P>

38	After I have taken into account all of these matters,  I am not satisfied
that the "chances of the defendant obtaining a fair
trial is unlikely" nor am I
satisfied that the defendant will suffer "significant prejudice".  The
plaintiff has discharged his onus
and satisfied me that it is just and
reasonable that an order be made that the limitation period be extended.  The
appropriate order
for costs is that costs be costs in the cause.
<P>

39	
<P>

The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff is granted an extension of time within which to commence
proceedings in this court for damages in respect of an
accident which occurred
on 10 February 1964 up to and including 8 August, 1996.
<P>

(2)	Costs are costs in the cause.
