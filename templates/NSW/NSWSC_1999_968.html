<P>

<b>50033/99 - PAYCE PROPERTIES PTY LTD v BBC HARDWARE LTD</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>Background to the Proceedings</b>
<P>

1   	By lease dated 21 January 1987 registered with the Land
Titles Office as dealing No X239979 ("the Lease"), the property known
as 3
Bennelong Road, Homebush Bay being Lot 1 in Deposited Plan No 226755 ("the
property") (now part of Lot 9 in Deposited Plan No
776611) was leased by the
Maritime Services Board of New South Wales ("the Board") to Montague L Meyer
(NSW) Pty Ltd which subsequently
changed its name to Montague L Meyer
(Australia) Pty Ltd ("Meyer").  The term of the Lease was forty years to
commence on 1 March
1984.
<P>

2   	The plaintiff, Payce Properties Pty Ltd ("Payce
Properties") purchased the property from the Board by contract completed in
March 1989.  A transfer dated 18 August 1993 of Meyer's interest as lessee of
the property to the defendant, BBC Hardware Limited
(then named Burns Philp
Hardware Limited) ("BBC") was registered on 20 October 1993 (Cf Dealing No
I735241).
<P>

3   	The following are the material provisions of the Lease:
<P>

<i>"20.  That the said demised premises shall be used by the Lessee solely for
the purposes of the business of the Lessee as now carried
on and/or for such
other business purposes as the Lessee may hereafter from time to time intend
and the Board may in writing approve
but such approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld."</i>
<P>

<i>"30.  That the Lessee shall pay in the manner hereinbefore provided the
following rents namely:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	during the first three years of the term an annual rental of ninety six
thousand dollars ($96,000);</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	during the next following three year period of the term an annual
rental equal to the rental provided for in paragraph (i) of
this clause
increased by an amount equal to ten per centum or such less factor as the Board
may determine of the amount of increase
(if any) in the valuation of the
demised premises for rental purposes as determined by the Valuer-General for
the State of New South
Wales at any time during the year immediately preceding
the date of commencement of such period of three years;</i>
<P>

<i>(iii)	thereafter for each and every succeeding period of three years at an
annual rental equal to the rental which applied during
the year immediately
preceding the respective dates of commencement of each three year period
increased by an amount equal to ten
per centum or such less factor as the Board
may determine of the amount (if any) by which the valuation of the demised
premises for
rental purposes as determined by the Valuer-General at any time
during such immediately preceding year exceeds the immediately preceding
valuation for rental purposes.</i>
<P>

<cite>PROVIDED THAT</cite><i> the valuation of the demised premises for rental
purposes at the commencement of this lease shall be taken and accepted as One
million
two hundred thousand dollars ($1,2000,000.00 (sic))."</i>
<P>

4   	A dispute arose as to the operation of clause 30 of the
Lease as a result of which proceedings were commenced.  The dispute
concerned
whether the valuation called for by clause 30(iii) of the Lease (which was
required to fix the rental for the period commencing
on 1 March 1991) properly
included the lessee's improvements to the property.
<P>

5   	That dispute was settled by the execution of a deed dated
31 May 1991 (and registered on 20 October 1993)("the Deed") entered
into by
Payce Properties as lessor and Meyer as lessee.  The Deed recites that the
parties had agreed to vary the Lease.  Clauses
4 and 5 of the Deed provide as
follows:
<P>

<i>"</i><cite>4.  Agreed rental</cite>
<P>

<i>Despite clause 30 of the Lease, the Lessee will on the dates listed in
column 1 pay the annual rent amounts listed in column 3 in
respect of the years
ending on the dates listed in column 2."</i>
<P>

<i>[There follows a list of specified amounts due on specified dates in respect
of six years, the first ending on 28 February 1991 and
the last on 28 February
1996 (in respect of which $550,000 was payable).]</i>
<P>

<i>"</i><cite>5.  Rent review</cite>
<P>

<i>(a)	For the purposes of clause 30 of the Lease the parties agree
that:</i>
<P>

<i>(1)	before 1 March 1996, the annual rent may not be varied except in
accordance with clause 4 of this deed,</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	from 1 March 1996 to 28 February 1999, the annual rent then payable will
be the sum of $550,000 plus an amount equal to 10% of
the amount, if any, by
which the valuation of the demised premises for rental purposes as determined
by the Valuer General at any
time during the year ending 28 February 1996
exceeds $5,250,000, and</i>
<P>

<i>(3)	from 1 March 1999, the annual rental payable will be determined in
accordance with clause 30(iii) of the Lease.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	The parties acknowledge that neither the execution of this deed nor the
discontinuance of the Proceedings amounts to an admission
by either party in
relation to their dispute in respect of the interpretation of clause 30 of the
Lease."</i>
<P>

<b>The Valuations</b>
<P>

6   	There was some delay in obtaining the 1996 valuation from
the Valuer General.  It was received on 18 February 1999 and valued
the
property at $8,500,000 ("the First Valuation").  If correct, it leads to an
annual rental for 1996-1999 of $875,000.
<P>

7   	The First Valuation reads inter alia:
<P>

<i>"INSTRUCTIONS:</i>
<P>

<i>To provide the Ministry for Forests and Marine Administration with a
valuation of the land described herein, being a `valuation of
the demised
premises for rental purposes' in accordance with clause 30 of Lease Registered
Number X 239979.</i>
<P>

<i>DATE OF INSPECTION:</i>
<P>

<i>5th February 1999.</i>
<P>

<i>DATE OF VALUATION:</i>
<P>

<i>28th February 1996.</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>TOWN PLANNING:</i>
<P>

<i>Enquiries indicate that land use is controlled by Sydney Regional
Environmental Plan No 24 - Homebush Bay Area, published in the government
Gazette 24 September 1993.  Map 1 attached to SREP 24 shows the Consent
Authority for the subject land as Auburn Council, except
where development
applications involve land/water interface.</i>
<P>

<i>Clause 10(4) of SREP 24 applied to the subject land.  At the date of the
valuation it stated;  </i>
<P>

<i>`(4)  An application for consent for development of land, shown on the
Homebush Bay Area Map as land to which this clause applies,
is not to be
determined by the granting of consent without the concurrence of the Homebush
Bay Development Corporation, except as
provided by subclauses (5) and (6).
</i>
<P>

<i>(5)  the concurrence of the Homebush Bay Development Corporation is not
required to the granting of consent to a development application
if the
development is in accordance with a development control plan.</i>
<P>

<i>(6)  The concurrence of the Homebush Bay Development Corporation ceases to
be required to the granting of consent to a development
application if:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	a copy of the application has been served upon the Corporation by the
consent Authority with a request to advise whether its concurrence
is granted
or refused;  and</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the Corporation has not within forty days of service of the request,
advised the consent authority whether its concurrence is
granted or
refused.'</i>
<P>

<i>The Homebush Bay Structure Plan was prepared in accordance with SREP 24 and
was adopted in August 1994.  Detailed development standards
for the subject and
adjoining lands are set out in Development Control Plan No 2 which took effect
from January 26, 1994.  This document
is complemented by guidelines for
development issued by Homebush Bay Development Corporation.</i>
<P>

<i>Objectives of DCP 2 include amongst other things, ...... to;</i>
<P>

&#183;	recognise the continuation of the existing 4(e) Waterfront Industrial
uses whilst providing for a longer term upgrading of
the future development of
the land as benefiting the Area's changing role and the land's location;
<P>

&#183;	facilitate a wide range of uses ranging from general to advanced
technology industries, including related wholesale, storage,
distribution,
servicing, research and administration), commercial, office, tourist-related
and recreational uses.
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>VALUATION BASIS AND OBSERVATIONS:</i>
<P>

<i>Clause 4.1 of DCP 2 in part states</i>
<P>

<i>`The Regional Plan does not zone the land for particular uses.  Whilst
recognising the constraints of existing leases and land uses
and their
continuation in the short to medium term, it is the Council's intention that
the industrial nature of the existing land
use be upgraded over time and that
the land should be redeveloped in accordance with the regional plan and the
structure plan.</i>
<P>

<i>The structure plan has identified the future uses of the Bay West Precinct
as being mixed commercial/industrial uses with plazas,
streets and lanes giving
direct physical and visual access to the water, and with people intensive
eating, entertainment and recreational
activities on the foreshores.</i>
<P>

<i>While, in the longer term, residential uses within this precinct may be
appropriate, this would need to be subject to detailed investigations.'</i>
<P>

<cite>This was the official view at the time this valuation is to be
made.</cite>
<P>

<i>Since that time the Homebush Bay Waterfront Draft Development Control Plan
was placed on exhibition in June 1998, it was adopted 10th
February 1999.  It
repeals DCP 2.  It identifies more precisely the development capabilities of
the precinct including the subject
land.  Figure 3 of the draft plan showed a
strip of mixed uses along Bennelong Road with the remainder of the subject land
being
residential.  The DCP as adopted appears to show all of the subject land
as residential, with leisure uses at the waterfront.  Clearly
the land's
potential for residential development is now capable of realisation, but at the
relevant date for this valuation, viz.
28 February 1996 it was a distant
potential.  Sales at or about the relevant date would reflect the market's
appreciation of this
potential.</i>
<P>

<i>Having regard to the foregoing comments the valuation as at 28 February 1996
has been approached on an industrial basis.</i>
<P>

<i>VALUATION:</i>
<P>

<i>For the purpose of a rent review in accordance with the relevant clauses of
the subject lease;  the value of a vacant possession basis
as at 28th February
1996 of the subject land including sea wall, reclamation and together with all
fixed improvements erected thereon
is determined to be EIGHT MILLION FIVE
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($8,500,000)."</i>
<P>

8   	The 1999 valuation, received from the Valuer General on 23
February 1999, is $12,000,000 ("the Second Valuation").  If correct,
it leads
to an annual rental of $1,225,000 payable from 1 March 1999.
<P>

9   	The Second Valuation reads inter alia:
<P>

<i>"INSTRUCTIONS:</i>
<P>

<i>To provide the Ministry for Forests and Marine Administration with a
valuation of the land described herein, being a `valuation of

<i>TOWN PLANNING:</i>
<P>

<i>Enquires indicate that land use is controlled by Sydney Regional

Gazette 24 September 1993, as amended.  Map 1 attached to SREP 24 shows the

except where

from 10 February 1999.  This
document repealed DCP 2 - Homebush Bay (Waterfront District - Bay West and Head
of Bay Precincts) which
had been in force from January 26, 1994.</i>
<P>

<i>At page 3 the DCP states;</i>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>VALUATION BASIS AND OBSERVATIONS:</i>
<P>

<i>The Homebush Bay Waterfront Draft Development Control Plan was placed on
exhibition in June 1998, it was adopted with amendments on
10th February 1999.
It repeals DCP 2.  It identifies more precisely the development capabilities of
the precinct including the subject

<P>

<i>The DCP as adopted shows all of the subject land as residential, with
leisure uses at the waterfront.  (The latter an indicative location
only.)</i>
<P>

<i>Having regard to the foregoing comments the valuation as at 23rd February
1999 has been approached on a residential basis.  On this
basis the existing
improvements, although possessing some utility, add no value.</i>
<P>

<i>VALUATION:</i>
<P>

<i>For the purpose of a rent review in accordance with the relevant clauses of
the subject lease;  the value on a vacant possession basis
at 23rd February
1999 of the subject land including sea wall, reclamation and together with all
fixed improvements erected thereon
is determined to be TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS
($12,000,000)."</i>
<P>

10   	Relying on these valuations Payce Properties sent to the
defendant on 25 February 1999 a notice requiring payment of $2,200,000.
<P>

<b>The Claim to Arrears of Rental</b>
<P>

11   	Payce Properties claims that the arrears of rental (after
taking into account payments made) are:
<P>

(a)	$975,000 for the period 1 March 1996 to 28 February 1999;  and
<P>

(b)	$675,000 for the year commencing 1 March 1999.
<P>

These proceedings are brought by Pace Properties seeking to recover the arrears
contended for.
<P>

<b>The Two Issues</b>
<P>

12   	It is common ground that two issues only are raised on the
pleadings.
<P>

13   	The first issue goes to the timing of the 1996 valuation.
BBC asserts that upon the proper construction of clause 5(a)(2)
of the Deed,
the First Valuation was not determined by the Valuer General "during the year
ended 28 February 1996".
<P>

14   	The second issue, again a question of construction, goes
to whether the two valuations were valuations of the demised premises
"for
rental purposes" within the meaning of clause 30(iii) of the Lease (see clause
5(a)(3) of the Deed).  BBC's contention is that
the Lease as varied by the
Deed, on its true construction required that any valuation of the property, to
be effective for rent review
purposes, be made "on the basis that the premises
continue to be used as a timber yard (or such other use as the parties might
agree
upon)" (paragraph c 11, Contentions in Cross-Claim).
<P>

<b>Reserved rulings on admissibility</b>
<P>

15   	The evidence comprised:
<P>

(1)	The affidavit of John Graham Angel of 14 August 1999 read by BBC.  Subject
to the rejection of portions of para 6(c), the affidavit
being objected to on
the grounds of relevance, was admitted subject to rulings on relevance to be
given as part of the judgment.
<P>

(2)	Exhibit P1/D1 comprising a volume of materials with an index recording:
<P>

(a)	which documents were tendered by the respective parties;
<P>

(b)	which documents were admitted without objection;
<P>

(c)	which documents, being objected to, were admitted subject to rulings on
relevance to be given as part of the judgment
<P>

Mr West QC for BCC seeks to rely in support of the suggested admissibility of
many of the P1/D1 materials, upon the following statement
of principle.
<P>

<i>"The true rule is that evidence of surrounding circumstances is admissible
to assist in the interpretation of the contract if the
language is ambiguous or
susceptible of more than one meaning.  But it is not admissible to contradict
the language of the contract
when it has a plain meaning.  Generally speaking
facts existing when the contract was made will not be receivable as part of the
surrounding circumstances as an aid to construction, unless they were known to
both parties, although, as we have seen, if the facts
are notorious knowledge
of them will be presumed."</i>
<P>

[<i>Codelfa Constructions Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20149%20CLR%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 149
CLR 337</a> at 352 per Mason J]
<P>

16   	Plainly the mere contention by a litigant party that
language in a contract is ambiguous or susceptible of more than one meaning,
will not mandate a holding to that effect.  Hence the initial step in
determining the admissibility question is for the court to
examine the Lease
and the Deed to determine whether the language used is ambiguous or susceptible
of more than one meaning.
<P>

17   	As will appear from the judgment which follows I am
satisfied that certain of the language used in the lease is ambiguous
or
susceptible of more than one meaning.  Nevertheless, the precise character and
nature of the evidence said to be tendered as "evidence
of surrounding
circumstances" requires to be closely examined to discern whether, even within
the wide ambit of the definition of
relevance in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence
Act</a></i>, this material is relevant.
<P>

18   	I note that in <i>Peabody Resources Ltd v Macquarie
Generation</i> [Einstein J, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Equity Division,
23 November 1998, unreported] the court dealt with a submission that
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55(1)</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> ought now permit the adducing into evidence of a post
contractual document the submission being that that document, if admitted,
"could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the
probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding".
<P>

19   	That judgment includes the following:
<P>

<i>"The matter turns ... upon whether or not Mason J in Codelfa Constructions
laid down a principle of substantive contract law or alternatively
simply dealt
with the matter on a procedural basis as going to the admissibility of evidence
and in particular treated with the exceptions
to the parole evidence
rule.</i>
<P>

<i>To my mind, Mason J in Codelfa did lay down a principle of substantive
contract law and the reach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> does not extend to
overcome the continued efficacy of that principle."  </i>
<P>

[Judgment para 436 and 437 on p 168]
<P>

20   	In similar fashion and in relation to the present tender
of evidence by the defendant, the reach of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>
ought not be held to extend to overcome the efficacy of the principles of
substantive contract law laid down in <i>Codelfa</i>.  
<P>

21   	In note the following passages from the judgment of Mason
J in <i>Codelfa</i>:
<P>

<i>"It is apparent that the principle on which the Judicial Committee acted in
Simpson [a reference to Bank of New Zealand v Simpson
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281900%29%20AC%20182" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1900) AC 182]</a> is that
where words in a contract are susceptible of more than one meaning extrinsic
evidence is admissible to show the facts which
the negotiating parties had in
their mind ... </i>
<P>

<i>Lord Wilberforce returned to the same theme in Reardon Smith [Line Ltd v
Hansen-Tangen  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%201%20WLR%20989" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 1 WLR 989].</a>  In a speech concurred in by a majority of the
members of the House of Lords he acknowledged that it is legitimate to have
regard
to ... `the surrounding circumstances'.  He went on to say:</i>
<P>

<i>`In a commercial contract it is certainly right that the court should know
the commercial purpose of the contract and this in turn
presupposes knowledge
of the genesis of the transaction, the background, the context, the market in
which the parties are operating.'"</i>
<P>

<i>			</i>	[149 CLR at 350]
<P>

22   	Mason J in <i>Codelfa</i> at 351<i> </i>further cited the
following passage from the speech of Lord Wilberforce in <i>Reardon
Smith</i>:
<P>

<i>" ... what the court must do must be to place itself in thought in the same
factual matrix as that in which the parties were.  All
of these opinions seem
to me implicitly to recognise that, in the search for the relevant background,
there may be facts which form
part of the circumstances in which the parties
contract in which one, or both, may take no particular interest, their minds
being
addressed to or concentrated on other facts so that if asked they would
assert that they did not have these facts in the forefront
of their mind, but
that will not prevent those facts from forming part of an objective setting in
which the contract is to be construed."</i>
<P>

23   	Finally, at 351 Mason J in<i> Codelfa</i> cited <i>DTR
Nominees Pty Ltd v Mona Homes Pty Ltd</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1978/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20138%20CLR%20423" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 138 CLR 423</a> at 429 where
Stephens, Jacobs and Mason JJ following <i>Prenn</i>, in a joint judgment
said:
<P>

<i>"A court may admit evidence of surrounding circumstances in the form of
`mutually known facts' `to identify the meaning of a descriptive
term' and it
may admit evidence of the `genesis' and objectively the `aim' of a transaction
to show that the attribution of a strict
legal meaning would make the
transaction futile ..."</i>
<P>

24   	I am clearly satisfied that it is legitimate to adduce
evidence to establish what was the identity and use of the property
which was
demised at the time of the lease.  I am also satisfied that evidence restricted
to the factual background known to the
parties at or before the date of the
contract is admissible.  Clearly also in a case where the meaning of a
descriptive term required
to be identified, evidence of mutually known facts
may be admitted for that purpose.  
<P>

25   	The difficulty is that many of the documents sought to be
tendered by the defendant either fall outside the above described
parameters
or, although, and sometimes only in part, falling within those parameters, have
either no weight at all or such slight
weight as not to affect the construction
issues at all.  In that circumstance it may be thought that the provisions of s
s 135 of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> are enlivened.  That section provides:
<P>

<i>"The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value, is
substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might:
 </i>
<P>

<i>(a)	be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or </i>
<P>

<i>(b)	be misleading or confusing, or</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	cause or result in undue waste of time."</i>
<P>

26   	Mr Tobias QC made plain that the plaintiff did not rely
upon this section or any part of it in support of its objection to
the
admission into evidence of the material in focus.  Notwithstanding that that is
the plaintiff's position I am not persuaded that
the court in the circumstances
is not permitted of its own instance to simply refuse to admit evidence if
satisfied, for example,
that the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 135(b)</a> are enlivened.  The
ambit of the definition of `relevance' in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 55</a> must be regarded as integrally
related to the discretions to reject evidence granted by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 135.</a>
<P>

27   	Ultimately the question of admissibility is simply one of
discretion informed by the above principles.
<P>

28   	In addressing the question of rulings as to admissibility
it should be recalled that the Maritime Services Board's history
of granting
leases of the subject property or part thereof extends back to March 1959.
Indeed, on the evidence sought to be tendered,
it appears that the Board first
granted a lease to A Hudson Ltd of 7 acres at 3 Bennelong Road in April 1965
which was followed by
a further lease to that company of March 1969 and that in
December 1970 the name of A Hudson Ltd was changed to Montague L Myer (NSW)
Pty
Ltd.  Hence the lease presently before the court is the last of a succession of
leases between essentially the same parties.
<P>

29   	In those circumstances a somewhat more expansive view of
the entitlement of the defendants to tender material seems to me
appropriate.
<P>

30   	The rulings as to admissibility are as follows:
<P>

(1)	I read the whole of the affidavit of Mr John Graham Angel of 14 August 199
excluding in para 6(c) the words "Weyerhausen and
Homebush Bay Timbers" and the
words "to the best of my recollection the Ralph Symonds site was independently
owned".  
<P>

I admit the extract from the Maritime Services Board's "municipality book"
dealing with the subject site which appears behind TAB
1 in P1/D1.
<P>

(2)	I reject the document which appears behind TAB 6 of the exhibit.
<P>

(3)	I reject the document which appears behind TAB 7 of the exhibit.
<P>

(4)	I reject the document which appears behind TAB 9 of the exhibit.
<P>

(5)	I reject the document which appears behind TAB 10 of the exhibit.
<P>

(6)	I reject the document which appears behind TAB 11 in the exhibit.
<P>

(7)	I admit the document which appears behind TAB 12 in the exhibit.
<P>

(8)	I admit the document which appears behind TAB 13 in the exhibit.
<P>

(9)	I admit the document appearing behind TAB 14 in the exhibit.
<P>

(10)	I admit the document which appears behind TAB 15 in the exhibit.
<P>

(11)	I reject the document which appears behind TAB 16 in the exhibit.  In
particular there is no evidence that this document was
ever communicated to the
lessee.  
<P>

(12)	I admit the document which appears behind TAB 17 of the exhibit.
<P>

(13)	I admit the document which appears behind TAB 18 of the exhibit.
<P>

(14)	I note, of course, that there may be a suggested relevance of documents
between 1 March 1984 and 21 January 1987 there having
been such an extended
period of time in which the leave to commence on 1 March 1984 was actually
dated 21 January 1987.
<P>

(15)	I see no relevance whatever to any of the issues in the case in the
documents numbered 23 to 34 and 36 in the exhibit.  These
documents are
rejected.
<P>

31   	Finally, before moving from the rulings on admissibility
it is perhaps pertinent to note that Mr Tobias having objected to
the
admissibility of the 25 June 1959 document which appears behind TAB 9 of the
exhibit and which deals with proposed allocation
of sites on the Homebush Bay
reclamation, sought, should the document be admitted, to draw strong support
for the lessor's case from
the document.  Had the document been admitted and
were it permissible to refer to the document on questions of construction it
may
be thought that the document suggests that the Maritime Services Board was
concerned about procuring maximum revenue [see particularly
para 2 where the
committee acknowledged "that care should be exercised in the allocation of
sites ... particularly in view of the
30 or 40 applications received from many
various types of industry."  See also the reference to " ... careful selection
of industries
which the committee considered should be allocated areas in order
of preference, according to the anticipated contribution of revenue
the Board
might derive from each."] 
<P>

32   	To my mind these references in the document which is
rejected and is not taken into account on the construction issues, simply
points up the danger of allowing into evidence material which can and should be
totally disregarded in construing the lease.  The
whole exercise of seeking to
have a court construe a document by reference to relevantly ancient internal
documents of a party or
third party not proven to have been seen by the parties
negotiating for a lease or containing information known by those parties,
is
fraught with peril.  
<P>

<b>The Time Issue</b>
<P>

33   	BBC's contention contains two assumptions.  The first is
that the Lease required the First Valuation to be determined during
the year
ended 28 February 1996.  The second is that, unless the requirement was a
condition precedent, the requirement was one in
respect of which time was of
the essence under the lease.
<P>

34   	In my view BBC's submissions on the first issue are
without substance.  There are virtually no indicia, outside of the actual
language used in the clause (ie use of the word "at"), which suggest that the
clause should not be read in conformity with the submissions
of Payce
Properties, namely that the clause requires to be read as if the words "as at"
had been used.  BBC's submissions on this
issue are rejected.
<P>

<b>Time of the Essence</b>
<P>

35   	It is then strictly unnecessary to deal with the question
which would only arise if BBC's submission had been accepted, namely
whether
the suggested requirement would have been one in respect of which time was of
the essence under the Lease.
<P>

36   	In deference to the submissions on this issue, I propose
to deal shortly with the question which only arises, if I be incorrect
in the
above holding.
<P>

37   	It is well established that a provision for rent review is
not one in respect of which time is of the essence unless it is
expressly or by
necessary implication made so.  The line of authority, at least since 1977,
commences with <i>United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley Borough Council</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20AC%20904" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) AC 904.</a>  The relevant holding is summarised in the headnote to the
following effect:
<P>

<i>"In the absence of any contra-indications in the express words of the lease
or in the interrelation of the rent review clause itself
and other clauses or
in the surrounding circumstances the presumption is that the timetable
specified in a rent review clause for
completion of the various steps for
determining the rent payable in respect of the period following the review date
is not of the
essence of the contract."</i>
<P>

38   	The oft quoted analysis of Lord Diplock is in the
following terms:
<P>

<i>"My Lords, although a lease is a synallagmatic contract it may also contain
a clause granting to the tenant an option to obtain a
renewal of the lease upon
the expiration of the term thereby granted.  Such a clause provides a classic
instance of an option to
acquire a leasehold</i> in futuro<i>, and it is well
established that a stipulation as to the time at which notice to exercise the
option must be given is of the essence
of the option to renew.  Although your
Lordships have not been referred to any direct authority upon the converse case
of a `break
clause' granting to the tenant an option to determine his interest
in the property and his contractual relationship with the landlord
prematurely
at the end of a stated period of the full term of years granted by the lease,
there is a practical business reason for
treating time as of the essence of
such a clause, which is similar to that applicable to an option to acquire
property.  The exercise
of this option by the tenant will have the effect of
depriving the landlord of the existing source of income from his property and
the evident purpose of the stipulation as to notice is to leave him free
thereafter to enter into a contract with a new tenant for
a tenancy commencing
at the date of surrender provided for in the break clause.</i>
<P>

<i>The rent review clauses that have given rise to the two instant appeals, as
well as nearly all those which have been considered in
the reported cases, if
they result in any alteration of the rent previously payable can only have the
effect of providing for the
payment of a higher rent than would be payable by
the tenant if the review clause had not been brought into operation.  So the
only
party who can benefit from a review of rent under these clauses is the
landlord.  It is accordingly unlikely that the tenant would
take the initiative
in obtaining a review of the rent, even where the clause contains provision for
his doing so - as it does in
the second of the instant appeals.  </i>
<P>

<i>It was this concentration of initiative and benefit in the landlord that led
the Court of Appeal in the second appeal to regard the
rent review clause as
conferring upon the landlord a unilateral right to bring into existence a new
contractual relationship between
the parties.  This they regarded as
sufficiently analogous to an option, to make time of the essence of the
occurrence of each one
of the events in the timetable laid down in a review
clause for the determination of the new rent.  For my part, I consider the
analogy
to be misleading.  The determination of the new rent under the
procedure stipulated in the rent review clause neither brings into
existence a
fresh contract between the landlord and the tenant nor does it put an end to
one that had existed previously.  It is
an event upon the occurrence of which
the tenant has in his existing contract already accepted an obligation to pay
to the landlord
the rent so determined for the period to which the rent review
relates.  The tenant's acceptance of that obligation was an inseverable
part of
the whole consideration of the landlord's grant of a term of years of the
length agreed.  Without it, in a period during
which inflation was anticipated,
the landlord would either have been unwilling to grant a lease for a longer
period than up to the
first review date or would have demanded a higher rent to
be paid throughout the term than that payable before the first review date.
 By
the time of each review of rent the tenant will already have received a
substantial part of the whole benefit which it was intended
that he should
obtain in return for his acceptance of the obligation to pay the higher rent
for the succeeding period.</i>
<P>

<i>My Lords, I see no relevant difference between the obligation undertaken by
a tenant under a rent review clause in a lease and any
other obligation in a
synallagmatic contract that is expressed to arise upon the occurrence of a
described event, where a postponement
of that event beyond the time stipulated
in the contract is not so prolonged as to deprive the obligor of substantially
the whole
benefit that it was intended he should obtain by accepting the
obligation.</i>
<P>

<i>So upon the question of principle which these two appeals were brought to
settle, I would hold that in the absence of any contra indications
in the
express words of the lease or in the inter relation of the rent review clause
itself and other clauses or in the surrounding
circumstances the presumption is
that the timetable specified in a rent review clause for completion of the
various steps for determining
the rent payable in respect of the period
following the review date is not of the essence of the contract."</i>
<P>

[1978 AC at 929-930]
<P>

39   	Some of the reasoning relied upon by Lord Diplock in the
first of the appeals included the following:
<P>

<i>"If the new rent had not been determined by the stipulated date, what is the
benefit that it was intended the tenant should obtain
from the contract but of
which he will have been deprived by its not being determined until later?  The
Court of Appeal took the
view that it was a detriment to the tenant not to know
what his new rent was going to be in advance of the date when it started to
accrue, as he might not be able to afford the additional rent and might feel
compelled to assign the residue of the term to someone
else.  For my part, I
find this unrealistic, if only because under this particular clause the tenant
can initiate the review procedure
himself and unless there is some unforeseen
delay on the part of the arbitrator, has it in his power to ensure that the new
rent
is determined before the stipulated date.  Apart from this, delay in the
determination of the new rent until after the first rent
day following the
stipulated date works to the economic benefit of the tenant since until the
higher rent has been determined he
has the use of the money representing the
difference between the higher rent and the new rent which he would otherwise
have been
compelled to pay.</i>
<P>

<i>The absence of any serious detriment to the tenant if the determination of
the new rent is postponed until some time after the commencement
of the ten
years period to which it will relate is to be contrasted with the detriment to
the landlord if strict adherence to the
date specified in the review clause is
to be treated as of the essence of the contract.  If it were determined even
slightly late
[and I interpolate that this might involve a one day situation]
the landlord would lose his right to the additional rent for the
whole period
of ten years until the next review date.</i>
<P>

<i>So far from finding any contra-indications to displace the presumption that
strict adherence to the timetable specified in this rent
review clause is not
of the essence of the contract, the considerations that I have mentioned appear
to me to reinforce the presumption."</i>
<P>

[(1978) AC at 931-932]
<P>

40   	In dealing with the second of the appeals Lord Diplock
referred to a circumstance which is not unlike the fact situation now
before
this Court.  His Lordship said:
<P>

<i>"The tenant's position under this clause thus differs from the tenant under
the rent review clause that is the subject of the first
appeal in as much as he
has no right under his contract to initiate the procedure or to apply for the
appointment of a valuer if
the landlord himself fails to do so within the
stipulated times.  But this difference has not in my view any significant
practical
consequences so far as concerns any detriment to the tenant from the
landlord's failure to do any of these things within the stipulated
time.  If
the tenant reckons that the advantage of knowing before the review date exactly
how much higher his new rent will be outweighs
the economic benefit of having
the use of the money representing the difference until the new rent has been
determined, he has the
remedy in his own hands.  Quite apart from the fact that
he can get a pretty good idea of what the market rent is from his own surveyor
or can himself offer to enter into negotiations with the landlord before the
stipulated time for serving a lessor's notice has expired,
so as soon as that
time has elapsed he can give to the landlord notice specifying a period within
which he requires the landlord
to serve a lessor's notice if he intends the
market rent to be determined and payable instead of the former rent for the
ensuing
seven years ... ".</i>
<P>

<i>				</i>[1978 AC at 933-934]
<P>

41   	The approach taken in United Scientific has been followed
by Clarke J in the <i>National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd v
Ampol Ltd</i> (1983) 3 BBR 9101 where Clarke J identified the broad rationale
behind the decision in <i>United Scientific</i> as follows:
<P>

<i>"(a)	that the right accorded to lessors in leases, particularly long term
leases, to revise the rent upward is an important and unseverable
part of the
consideration for the granting of the lease;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	 the parties should not be taken to have contemplated that that right be
lost by a failure to comply with the timetable activating
the change."</i>
<P>

				[at p 9105]
<P>

42   	At 9106 his Honour said:
<P>

<i>"There is not to be found in this lease, in contra-distinction to the leases
in some of the decided cases, any time pressures, created
by later steps in the
contractual procedures required to be followed to achieve a determination of
the new rental, which tend to
suggest that compliance with the time provided
for the giving of the notice is essential;  nor an express provision, or,
indeed any
clear indication of intention that the time for any later steps is
to be of the essence.  Once, according to the terms of the lease,
the
procedures are put in motion then it matters not that they are not completed
quickly.</i>
<P>

<i>The dominant considerations which influenced their Lordships in United
Scientifc Holdings apply equally here.  If Ampol's argument
be right then the
giving of a notice one day out of time would mean that the lessor forfeited all
right to an increase for a five
year period.  It is hard to contemplate that
this was the parties' intention."</i>
<P>

43   	Cole J accepted the principles stated in <i>United
Scientific</i> in <i>MLC Life Ltd v Edmond Barton Chambers (Level 43)
Co-operative Ltd</i> (Supreme Court of NSW, Commercial Division, 17 August
1990, unreported;  BC 9002123).  In that case on the facts Cole J found that
a
contrary intention was contained within the terms of the relevant clause of the
lease to the effect that the particular period
provided for be a strict
contractual time limit.  This was particularly because the clause provided for
what was to occur if there
was a failure to appoint a valuer within 21 days by
one party.  There is no similar provision providing for what is to occur if the
time period stipulation is not complied with in the case presently before the
court.
<P>

44   	Yet again in <i>GR Mailman and Associates v Wormald
(Australia) Pty Ltd (</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1991%29%2024%20NSWLR%2080" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1991) 24 NSWLR 80</a> reference was made with approval by
Gleeson CJ, as also by Samuels JA, to <i>United Scientific</i>.  
<P>

45   	Drawing from the analysis of Lord Salmon, Gleeson CJ set
out at 86-87 a detailed examination of the judicial solution to a
practical
commercial problem which had been achieved in United Scientific:
<P>

<i>"The decision in United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley Borough Council
was, and was expressed to be, a judicial response to a practical
commercial
problem relating to the fixing of the rental for leases, and especially long
leases, in times of inflation.  The expectation
of inflation and the
probability of variations in the rates at which it will occur, make it
commercially impractical in many cases
for the parties to a lease to agree upon
a single figure which will be an acceptable rent for the whole of the term of
the lease.
 To overcome this difficulty they commonly establish a machinery for
rent review at various stages during the term of the lease,
the substantial
object of the machinery usually being to ascertain the current market rent for
the subject premises and to make that
the operative rent.  The market rent may
be established by agreement, or in default of agreement, by some procedure for
dispute resolution.</i>
<P>

<i>Lord Salmon said (at 948):</i>
<P>

<i>`In a period of acute inflation, such as we have experienced for the last 20
years or so, and may well continue to experience for
many years to come, what
is a fair market rent at the date when a lease is granted will probably become
wholly uneconomic within
a few years.  Tenants who are anxious for security of
tenure require a term of reasonable duration, often 21 years or more.
Landlords,
on the other hand, are unwilling to grant such leases unless they
contain rent revision clauses which will enable the rent to be
raised at
regular intervals to what is then the fair market rent of the property demised.
Accordingly, it has become the practice
for all long leases to contain a rent
revision clause providing for a revision of the rent every so many years.
Leases used to provide
for such a revision to be made every 10 years.  Now the
period is normally every seven and not infrequently every five years.  To
my
mind, it is totally unrealistic to regard such clauses as conferring a
privilege upon the landlord or as imposing a burden upon
the tenant.  Both the
landlord and the tenant recognise the obvious, viz, that such clauses are fair
and reasonable for each of them.
 I do not agree with what has been said in
some of the authorities, namely, that a rent revision clause is for the benefit
of the
landlord alone and not at all for the benefit of the tenant.  It is
plainly for the benefit of both of them.  It is for the benefit
of the tenant
because without such a clause he would never get the long lease which he
requires;  and under modern conditions, it
would be grossly unfair that he
should.  It is for the benefit of the landlord because it ensures that for the
duration of the lease
he will receive a fair rent instead of a rent far below
the market value of the property which he demises.  Accordingly the landlord
and the tenant by agreement in their lease provide that at stated intervals
during the term, the rent should be brought up to what
is then the fair market
rent.  The revision clause itself lays down the administrative procedure or
machinery by which the fair market
rent shall be ascertained.'</i>
<P>

<i>Much litigation and uncertainty arose  out of a particular difficulty that
was encountered in the wording of rent review clauses.
 Such clauses commonly
specify times within which various steps are to be taken towards crystallising
and resolving any dispute as
to what is to be the new rent.  However, the
possibility of a failure strictly to observe the stipulations as to time,
whether as
a result of neglect or accident or for some other cause, is always
present.  Griffiths LJ in the later case of Trustees of Henry
Smith's Charity v
AWADA Trading &amp; Promotion Services Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%2047%20P%20%26%20CR%20607" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 47 P &amp; CR 607</a> at 616,
said:</i>
<P>

<i>`When they enter into a lease such as this the expectation of both landlords
and tenants is that a fair market rent will be paid throughout
the lease and
unless driven to do so by the wording of the lease I am loth to construe the
machinery provided for arriving at a fair
market rent as forcing either the
tenant to pay an exorbitantly high rent or the landlord to receive a
ridiculously low rent, neither
of which bears any relation to a fair market
rent because one or other of them was one day late in observing the timetable
set out
in the rent review provisions of the lease.'</i>
<P>

<i>The solution to the problem was found by invoking principles (whether they
are properly described as principles derived from law or
equity or some process
of `fusion' is a question upon which I do not intend to enter) according to
which stipulations as to time
may be treated as inessential.  This is
exemplified in Lord Salmon's speech in United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley
Borough Council
(at 950-951) where his Lordship said:</i>
<P>

<i>`I recognise that the lease relates to what could be fairly described as a
commercial transaction.  In commercial transactions, provisions
as to time are
usually but not always regarded as being of the essence of the contract.  They
are certainly so regarded where the
subject matter of the contract is the
acquisition of a wasting asset or of a perishable commodity or is something
likely to change
rapidly in value.  In such contract, the buyer may well be
seriously prejudiced.  The time provision in a rent revision clause of
the
present kind, even in a lease concerning a commercial transaction, is however,
different in character and I regard it as not
being of the essence of the
contract unless it is made so expressly or by necessary implication.  In the
present case it is certainly
not made so expressly nor, in my view, by
implication.  ...</i>
<P>

<i>I do not regard the leases in either of the present appeals, nor in Samuel

return), as vesting any option in the landlord to have the rent revised.  In my
opinion each lease constitutes,
amongst other things, an agreement between the
parties that, at stated intervals, the rents shall be revised so as to bring
them
into line with the then open market rent.  The rent revision clauses
specify the machinery or guidelines for ascertaining the open
market rent.
These provisions as to time are not, in my opinion, mandatory or inflexible;
they are only directory.'"</i>
<P>

46   	Gleeson CJ summarised the effect of the decision in<i>
United Scientific</i> in the words used by Slade LJ in <i>Trustees of Henry
Smith's Charity v AWADA Trading and Promotion Services Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%2047%20P%20%26%20CR%20607" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 47 P
&amp; CR 607</a> at 619 as follows:
<P>

<i>"(1)	Where a rent review clause confers on a landlord or tenant a right for
his benefit or protection, as part of the procedure for
ascertaining the new
rent, and that right is expressed to be exercisable within a specified time,
there is a rebuttable presumption
of construction that time is not intended to
be of the essence in relation to any exercise of that right.</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	In a case where the presumption applies, the other party concerned may,
if he wishes to bring matters to a head after the stipulated
time for the
exercise of the right has expired, give to the owner of the right a notice
specifying a period within which he requires
the right to be exercised if at
all;  the period thus specified will if it is reasonable then become of the
essence of the contract
 ...</i>
<P>

<i>(3)	The presumption is rebuttable by sufficient `contra indications in the
express words of the lease or in the inter relation of
the rent review clause
itself and other clauses or in the surrounding circumstances' ... </i>
<P>

<i>(4)	Though the best way of rebutting the presumption is to state expressly
that stipulations as to the time by which steps provided
for by the rent review
clause are to be taken are to be treated as of the essence ... this is not the
only way.  Any form of expression
which clearly evinces the concept of finality
attached to the end of the period or periods prescribed will suffice to rebut
the presumption.
 The parties are quite free to contract on the basis that time
is to be of the essence if they so wish."</i>
<P>

47   	There is plainly no express provision making time of the
essence in relation to the clause presently before the court and
the terms of
the clause in my view imply the contrary.  Of very particular significance in
relation to the analysis is the fact that
the subject clause does not make any
provision at all as to the effect, if any, which the parties intended to attach
by way of consequences
of non compliance with the time limit.  This matter was
stressed by Meagher  JA in <i>Mailman &amp; Associates</i> at 99:
<P>

<i>"Once a contract expressly spells out the consequences of non compliance
with a time limit I cannot see how it can be argued that
the time limit is non
essential ..."</i>
<P>

48   	Finally, it is noteworthy that in <i>Amherst v James
Walker Goldsmith &amp; Silversmith Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20Ch%20305" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) Ch 305</a> the Court of Appeal
held that in the absence of time being of the essence, there was not to be read
into the lease even an implied
term that the notice be given within a
reasonable time.  Even delay plus hardship to the tenant would not disentitle
the landlord
to exercise the right, which he has, on the true construction of
the contract, unless the combination amounted to an estoppel (per
Laughton and
Oliver LJJ).  This I note was followed in <i>Maritime Services Board of NSW v
Australian Shipping Commission</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2027%20NSWLR%20258" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 27 NSWLR 258</a> at 278-9.
<P>

<b>Conditions Precedent</b>
<P>

49   	In an attempt to avoid the impact of this line of
authority BBC's counsel argued that the requirement that the First Valuation
be
determined during the year ended 28 February 1996 amounted to a condition
precedent to the lessor's entitlement to the benefit
of the rent review
adjustment which would, had the valuation been determined timeously, been
clear.
<P>

50   	Samuels JA had wrestled with this problem in<i>
Mailman</i> at 93-95:
<P>

<i>"I must confess that if I were not guided by authority, I would, by the
application of the general principles of the law of contract,
have little
difficulty in construing the notice requirements in par (b) as being of the
essence.  The paragraph provides that the
lessee may dispute the lessor's
assessment of the current rent if it wishes.  It does not require the lessee to
do so.  If the lessee
does give notice in writing within the period specified
then the lessor is obliged to appoint the valuer nominated by the lessee.
 If
the lessee does not do so, then, by dint of par (d), it is deemed to have
accepted the lessor's assessment of the current market
rent set out in the
notice contemplated by par (a).  It would have been unnecessary to include this
last-mentioned provision if the
lessee were obliged to dispute the lessor's
valuation.  It follows that the stipulation in par (b), requiring the giving of
notice
in writing to the lessor within fourteen days of the lessor's notice, is
not a promissory term of the contract.  </i><cite>It simply lays down an act by
the lessee as a condition precedent to the lessor's obligation, under para (c),
to appoint the valuer
nominated by the lessee.  There is authority for the
proposition that the expression of a provision in the form of a non-promissory
condition precedent gives that provision the character of essentiality, thereby
requiring strict compliance before it can be said
to have been fulfilled:
Tricontinental Corporation Ltd v HDFI Ltd (1990) 21 NSWLR.</cite>
<P>

<i>The learning at common law and in equity (to which reference was made in
United Scientific) as to whether a time stipulation is of
the essence of the
contract is traditionally relevant to situations where there has been a breach
of a time stipulation of promissory
character.  This is implicit in the
decision of the High Court in Louinder v Leis <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR 509.</a>  That case
concerned a contract for the sale of land which contained a time stipulation
which was not of the essence.  Mason J, with
whom Stephen J and Wilson J
agreed, discussed (at 524-525) the effect of s 13 of the Conveyancing
Act:</i>
<P>

<i>`The true position is that equity and common law differed not so much in the
construction of the contract as in the consequences which
they assigned to a
breach of it ...  Equity departed from the common law in insisting that a
breach of a stipulation as to time only
entitled the innocent party to rescind
where time was of the essence of the contract.  It was otherwise at common law.
Consequently,
equity would intervene in appropriate cases to prevent the
innocent party from enforcing his common law right to rescind and to assert
her
own rule.  It follows that in such cases the operation of s 13 converts the
character of a time stipulation from essential to
non-essential;  it does not
otherwise alter its terms or its construction.  Thus the time stipulation is
not read as if it called
for performance by the stipulated date or "within a
reasonable time" or "within a reasonable time thereafter".'</i>
<P>

<i>See, also, per Gibbs CJ (at 513-514).  His Honour referred with approval to
passages in United Scientific from the speeches of Lord
Diplock and Lord Simon
to the effect that in equity, and now under the judicature system, a
non-essential time stipulation can be
made essential by a notice calling for
performance.  Moreover, what was implicit in Louinder was made explicit in
Perri v Coolangatta
Investments Pty Ltd <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 29</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20537" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR 537.</a>  In that case Gibbs
CJ (at 545-546) and Brennan J (at 569), with whom Stephen J agreed, accepted
that the equitable rules concerning
time stipulations (including notices to
complete) had no application where the time stipulation in the contract was a
non-promissory
condition precedent  to the existence of a contractual
obligation, even where the condition precedent required an act or event to
occur within a reasonable time.</i>
<P>

<i>Whether a stipulation is a non-promissory condition precedent or a
promissory term of the contact is a matter of construction, the
answer to
which, as Louinder decides, does not differ in equity or at common law.  It
would seem to follow from Perri that s 13 of
the Conveyancing Act, properly
construed, has no application to non-promissory conditions precedent since
equity follows the law
in this regard.  The effect of the failure to fulfil a
non-promissory condition precedent remains that the obligation or obligations
which presuppose its fulfilment will not arise.  As I said in Tricontinental
(at 704D) of my judgment:</i>
<P>

<i>` ... Where a provision lays down an act by one party as a condition
precedent to the existence of an obligation on the part of the
other party, the
condition precedent will not be fulfilled until the former party does an act
that strictly matches that described
in the contract.'</i>
<P>

<cite>Be that as it may, it seems to me that the High Court has accepted the
authority of United Scientific in Australia.  In Gollin &amp;
Co Ltd v Karenle
Nominees Pty Ltd <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 38</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20153%20CLR%20455" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 153 CLR 455</a>, a case in which the court had to consider
the effect of the lessor's failure to appoint a valuer under a rent review
clause, the
court (at 468) cited United Scientific with approval.  Accordingly,
our analysis must begin with the assumption that the law as stated
in United
Scientific applies to time stipulations in rent review clauses.  This is so
even accepting that it seems somewhat inapposite
to speak of `breach' of a
right to seek a rent review, or that one can issue a notice to complete to make
the exercise of an adversary
right within a specified time essential to a
contract.</cite><i>  Yet, these matters are implicit in the speeches of their
Lordships in United Scientific." [emphasis added]</i>
<P>

51   	To my mind the argument put by BBC's counsel is foreclosed
by the decision in <i>Mailman</i>, and particularly by the above observations
of Samuels JA. 
<P>

52   	In any event, as a matter of construction of the clause
here in question, in my view, the clause cannot be characterised as
a condition
precedent to the entitlement of the lessor to achieve a higher rent by the
enlivening of the review procedure.  Seen
in context there are no, or no
substantial, indicia to support the contrary view.
<P>

<b>The Construction Issue - "Valuations ... for rental purposes"</b>
<P>

53   	Senior Counsel for BBC drew attention to the fact that the
expression "for rental purposes" appears three times in clause
30 of the Lease,
namely in sub-clauses (ii) and (iii) and in the proviso to clause 30.  The
submission is that the expression "directs
attention to the purposes for which
the lease permits user of the demised premises".  Put another way the
submission was that the
clause directed attention "to the purposes of the
lease, that is the purposes of the business which is conducted under it"
[transcript
p 49].
<P>

54   	BBC's submission directed attention to the restriction
upon user which appears in clause 20 of the lease earlier set out.
<P>

55   	The argument put for BBC also directed attention to clause
4 of the Lease which obliged the lessee to at all times insure
and keep insured
all buildings on the demised premises in the joint names of the lessee and the
lessor.  This was said to be a further
indication in the Lease that the lessor
was taking a particular interest in the nature of the business which was being
conducted
on the property.  To my mind no inference of this kind can be drawn,
it being clear that the lessor's interest in improvements being
buildings would
require to be identified as an insurable interest.
<P>

56   	Attention was also directed to clause 13 as including
covenants which reflected aspects of the permitted user.  Clause 13
provided
that the lessee should not "permit, suffer or allow any ashes, coal, ballast,
oil, refuse or other material to be thrown
or discharged or to fall or flow
into the Port from the demised premises or from any vessel which may be berthed
or moored thereat".
<P>

57   	BBC's submissions sought to pray in aid as admissible to
assist, in the construction of the Lease, evidence going to the history
of the
site from the early part of the century.  The submission was that the lease was
the product of a scheme promoted by the Sydney
Harbour Trust in the early part
of the century and followed on by the Maritime Services Board which is said to
have seen the establishment
on the site, of reclaimed land at Homebush Bay, of
an early version of what has become known as an "industrial park".  The
submission
was that the particular purposes of the industrial park of which the
property is but a part, was the establishment and consolidation
of industry
which used water, transport and facilities.  It is said to have been typically
timber yards or depot type industries.
 
<P>

58   	Senior counsel for BBC took the court to legislation
forming part of Ex P1/D1 said to demonstrate that from about 1904 after
the
Sydney Harbour Trust was established with powers to resume land and to set up
areas for development (which powers are said to
have been taken over by the
Maritime Services Board upon its formation and continued under its regime until
the time of occupation
of the subject property) it was policy to establish an
industrial park to cater for the operations of businesses which required
harbour
access.  It was put that there was a financial incentive in this
because it would no doubt have produced harbour fees and the like
for the
Maritime Services Board.  Counsel for BBC submitted that the documents sought
to be relied upon as part of P1/D1 and the
affidavit to which I have referred,
"demonstrate ... that this area at Homebush Bay was attractive to timber yards
in particular.
 There were some other businesses, but it seems that the
majority of them were timber merchants, saw millers and the like.  There
was a
logic about all of that because logs could be brought into the harbour and then
floated upstream ... and moored alongside the
pillions and the like adjacent to
these lots of land".  (transcript 42)
<P>

59   	The document behind TAB 1 in exhibit P1/D1 relied upon by
BBC's counsel and now admitted is said to have been an extract from
the
Maritime Services Board "Municipality Book" dealing with the subject site.  The
document purports to give details of tenancies
in relation to this site for a
number of years from 1959.  It is said to be a convenient collection of the
history of the particular
property from the date when Rozelle Timber acquired
possession of the land.  The submission is that the document assists in
enabling
the court to discern a logical progression in accordance with a policy
which the MSB is said to have followed, namely the relocation
of timber mills
and the like to this area.  The submission is that Rozelle Timber "was just one
of a number of businesses of the
same kind which were swept up in this policy
of location to an industrial park of saw mills and what [might be called] the
waterfront
industries or depot industries which were located in this area".
The submission is that "what the MSB was doing and these companies
were swept
up in it and ... was part of the factual matrix at the time that Montague Meyer
came along and at the time that we acquired
our rights under the instrument
which your Honour now is concerned with". (transcript 45)
<P>

60   	The document behind TAB 15 which was received by the
lessee and is dated 30 March 1984 and was written by the Board does not
assist
in any material way.
<P>

61   	Returning to BBC's submissions they were, inter alia, as
follows:
<P>

<i>"The expression "for rental purposes" suggests that the rent review is to be
carried out so as to derive a figure which recognises
and accommodates the user
of the premises as a timber yard.  The task is not to be approached upon the
basis of assessing "the highest
and best use" of the land or as having regard
to its potential as a development site or for residential occupation - see

<P>

<i>Neither of the valuations upon which the plaintiff seeks to rely conforms to
such a principle nor pays regard to the user of the premises
as identified in
the lease.  Neither valuation is one which is envisaged by the lease or the
variation of the lease."</i>
<P>

62   	BBC's submissions were that no assumption could be made in
relation to the subject clause that the fee simple was to be valued
at its
highest and best use.  The submission was that the argument put by Payce
Properties did not attribute a sensible meaning to
the words "valuation for
rental purposes".  The submission was that the Payce Properties proposed
construction must result in the
words "valuation for rental purposes having no
sensible meaning".  <i>Plinth Property</i> <i>Investments</i>, a decision of
the United Kingdom Court of Appeal, concerned a very different form of rent
review clause to that presently before
the court.  The underlease of office
premises there under consideration contained a covenant by the underlessees
"not to use the
demised premises or any part thereof or suffer the same to be
used otherwise than as offices ... in connection with the [underlessees]
business of consulting civil engineers".  The underlease also contained a rent
review clause providing that there was to be a rent
review for the last eight
years of the term, that the rent for that period was, in the absence of
agreement, to be determined by
an arbitrator and that "the amount to be
determined by the arbitrator shall be of [sic] such amount as shall in the
opinion of the
arbitrator represent the fair rack rental market value for the
demised premises ... <u>having regard to </u>rental values of property then
current and to <u>the provisions of this underlease</u> ... ".  (emphasis
added)
<P>

63   	Agreement not having been reached between the parties, the
question of rent to be paid for the last eight years of the lease
was remitted
to an arbitrator for determination, and before the arbitrator it was agreed
that, without the restrictive covenant as
to user, the full market rental of
the premises would be &#163;130,200 but that, with that restriction, it would
be &#163;89,200.
 The underlessors contended for the former sum, the
underlessees contended for the latter sum.  The arbitrator ruled in favour of
the underlessees.  On a special case stated by the arbitrator for the opinion
of the High Court the material being question being
"whether the arbitrator can
take into account the fact that the landlord might consent to a change of user
... ", Slynn J affirmed
the arbitrator's award.  
<P>

64   	To my mind the decision is not to the point in relation to
the clause presently before the court.  As Brandon LJ said in Plinth:
<P>

<i>"It seems to me that, when a lease provides that the arbitrator is to have
regard to the provisions of the lease it means the provisions
that give rights
to and impose obligations on each of the parties to it.  What the arbitrator
has to consider is what those rights
and obligations are on either side and
assess the rent in the light of them ... ".</i>
<P>

65   	The lease presently before the court for construction
merely uses the words "the valuation of the demised premises for rental
purposes", and makes no <u>express</u> reference to regard being required to be
had to the provisions of the lease itself.
<P>

66   	Nor do I gain any assistance from the decision of the
Court of Appeal in <i>Manukau</i> which refers to<i> Plinth</i> as an authority
requiring "the valuer to have regard to such use restrictions as may be
contained in the lease and not to assess
value on the basis that the lessor
will, or even might, relax or waive any restrictive user clause".  
<P>

67   	I derive no particular assistance from the references to
<i>Plinth</i> in <i>SA Service Stations.</i>
<P>

<b>Circularity</b>
<P>

68   	Mr Tobias QC sought to rely on the decision of Cole J in
<i>Payce Properties Pty Ltd v Harrisons Timber Pty Ltd</i> (Supreme Court of
New South Wales, 14 December 1990, unreported) where his Honour held that
absurdity was produced on the submissions
of the defendant.
<P>

69   	In that case clause 30 provided:
<P>

<i>"30.  That the lessee shall pay in the manner hereinbefore provided the
following rents namely:</i>
<P>

<i>1.     (i)	During the first five years of the term an annual rent of Ten
thousand seven hundred and twenty five dollars ($10,725,000)
and it is hereby
agreed that this sum is the equivalent of six dollars fifty per centum of the
value of the said land at the commencement
of the term hereby granted such
value being One hundred and sixty five thousand dollars ($165,000.00).</i>
<P>

<i>       (ii)	During the next and each succeeding five year period of the term
an annual rent equivalent to six dollars fifty per centum
of the value of the
said land at the commencement of each five year period.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	For the purpose of this clause the expression `the value of the said
land' shall mean the value as mutually agreed upon or failing
agreement as
determined by the Valuer General for the State of New South Wales of the land
above described with the seawall and reclamation
thereon and having regard to
any facilities or services from time to time affecting or relating to the said
land but not including
nor having regard to the value of any buildings
structures roads drains fences or gates plants or machinery made constructed or
installed
by or at the cost of the Lessees."</i>
<P>

70   	His Honour at pages 4-5 said:
<P>

<i>"The defendant contended that clause 30 required determination of `the value
of the said land' which meant `the land above described
with seawall and
reclamation thereon' plus services but disregarding tenants improvements.  Thus
it was said the valuation should
have been of the land subject to the
encumbrance of the existing lease.  That it is not what had been valued.</i>
<P>

<i>I reject that argument.  The clear intent of clause 30 is to fix a rental
each five years equivalent to 6.5% of the value of the land
at the commencement
of each five year portion of the forty five year lease period.  At the
commencement of the lease obviously the
land was unencumbered by any lease.
`Value of the said land' where used in the first paragraph of clause 30 means
valuation of the
fee simple.  It has the same meaning in both sub paragraphs of
the first paragraph of clause 30.  It is inconceivable that, the rental
for the
initial five year term being based upon a value related to the fee simple
unencumbered by the lease, subsequent rentals are
to be based upon the land
valued subject to the existing lease.</i>
<P>

<i>Further, the introductory words to the lease which I have quoted above
describe the land of the Maritime Services Board as being an
estate in fee
simple.  A distinction is drawn between that estate and `the demised premises';
which comprise the lessee's estate.
 The clear intent of clause 30 is to value
the totality of the lessor's and the lessee's estate for the purpose of rent
fixing.</i>
<P>

<i>The alternative view produces an absurdity.  The extent of affectation of
the land by encumbrance of the lease, and thus the land's
value, would depend
upon the rental fixed for a review period which in turn would affect the
valuation of the land.  Insoluble circularity
would be produced in the
valuation exercise,</i>
<P>

<i>The clear purpose of clause 30 is to value the land unencumbered each five
years to fix a rental such that the lessor receives and
the lessee pays a
figure equivalent to 6.5% of the land comprising the fee simple."</i>
<P>

71   	Here the clause is of course in different terms.  I do not
accept that a necessary obstacle in the path of BBC's construction
involves
insoluble circularity.  The parties were free to agree that the subject
valuation for the purposes of fixing the rent could
be based on the premises
being used as a timber yard (or such other use as the parties might agree
upon).  The question is one of
construction.
<P>

<b>Ruling on Construction</b>
<P>

72   	In my view there is substance in the plaintiff's
submission that clause 30(iii) requires valuation of "the demised premises"
-
that is, the land demised by the Lease which is described on the cover page of
the Lease.  Hence what is required is a valuation
of the largest interest in
the specified parcel of land which the then owner could have granted, ie the
fee simple - not of a lesser
interest such as the lessee's interest or the
reversion:  <i>Payce Properties Pty Ltd</i> (supra) at p 4;
<P>

73   	On the commencement of the Lease the land was unencumbered
by any lease.  It would be, I accept, to say the least unusual,
if the term in
the proviso had a different meaning than in clauses 30(ii) and (iii).
<P>

74   	A further substantial hurdle to the defendant's proposed
construction is of course that there is nothing to suggest that the
parties
assumed at commencement of the lease that the use at the time of commencement
having been a timber yard, would for the next
forty years continue to be the
use of the demised premises.  Clause 20 clearly contemplates that that use may
change as the business
of the lessee from time to time (including situations of
assignment), might change.  Why one may rhetorically ask, would the parties,
especially the Maritime Services Board, contemplate over a forty year period at
three yearly intervals, a valuation which might be
based on an underutilisation
of the premises for a use that may from time to time have been so limited in
its nature that if the
land could only be valued by reference to that use, it
would result in a relatively low valuation of the land.
<P>

75   	The whole purpose of the rent review provision for a very
long term lease such as the present lease is, I accept, to enable
the lessor to
obtain the benefit of higher rents based on increasing land values, that is to
say, increasing land values which accord
with permissible lawful uses from time
to time. 
<P>

76   	In my view the true meaning of the term "for rental
purposes" is a reference to the reason or purpose of the valuation.
<P>

77   	The defendant's contention that the words "the valuation
of the demised premises for rental purposes" requires a valuation
in order to
be effective for rent review purposes to be made on the basis that the premises
continue to be used as a timber yard
or for such other use as the parties might
agree upon, is rejected.  The parties did not use those words but used only the
words
"valuation ... for rental purposes".  
<P>

78   	The basis of BBC's detailed submissions in relation to the
valuations falls away once BBC's approach to the construction question
is
rejected.  Clearly enough the valuations do not proceed upon the basis that the
