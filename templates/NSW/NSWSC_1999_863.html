EQUITY DIVISION

<b>MASTER McLAUGHLIN</b>
<P>

<i>Friday, 27 August 1999</i>
<P>

<b>2392/98	JOHN EDWARD CLEARY   -v-   SANDRA ELIZABETH YOUNG</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:   </b>These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act </i>1982</a>.
<P>

2   	By summons filed on 12 May 1998, the plaintiff, John Edward
Cleary, claims an order for provision for his maintenance, education
and
advancement in life out of the estate of his late father, John Albert Cleary
(to whom I shall refer as "the deceased").
<P>

3   	The deceased died on 14 October 1995, aged 89. He left a
will dated 6 September 1991, Probate whereof was on 21 October 1997
granted to
Sandra Elizabeth Young, the executor named in such will (who is the defendant
to the present proceedings).
<P>

4   	That Probate was granted in solemn form, as a result of
contested proceedings brought by the present defendant against the
present
plaintiff. Those proceedings were heard by Mr Justice Simos in June 1997. His
Honour's judgment, published on 21 October
1997, was admitted into evidence (as
Exhibit A) at the hearing before me. 
<P>

5   	The deceased, who was a widower at the time of his death,
was survived by his four children, being Janice Eileen (Mrs Coles),
who was
born in 1938 and who is presently aged 61; Deidre Ann (Mrs Hatton), who was
born in 1940 and who is presently aged 59; John
Edward (the present plaintiff),
who was born on 2 November 1943 and who is presently aged 55; Sandra Elizabeth
(Mrs Young), who was
born in 1945 and who is presently aged 54. The deceased's
wife died in 1991, aged 69. 
<P>

6   	The assets of the deceased at the time of his death
consisted of a house property situate at and known as 62 Wyandra Avenue,
Harbord (to which in the Inventory of Property a value of $180,000 was
ascribed); a gold ring (having an estimated value of $1,500)
and a Mitsubishi
Sigma station wagon (having an estimated value of $3,000). The plaintiff
disputes the value attributed to the gold
ring (which is presently in the
custody of his solicitor), and asserts that it is only of minimal value.
<P>

7   	It would appear that the present value of the house
property at Harbord is at least $300,000. An auction of the property was
conducted in March 1999, but no bids for it were received. However, by the time
of the hearing, the defendant had received an offer
of $300,000, which she did
not propose to accept, being of the view that the property was worth much more
than that amount. It would
appear that the value of that property is,
essentially, the value of its land, and that the structure presently standing
thereon
will, in fact, be demolished by any purchaser.
<P>

8   	By his will the deceased gave the contents of his house
property to the defendant, and gave the balance of his estate to his
four
children equally. 
<P>

9   	It will be appreciated that the costs of the defendant of
the present proceedings must be paid out of the estate of the deceased.
It is
estimated that those costs will total between $12,000 and $15,000. There is
also an indebtedness to the defendant for funeral
expenses ($1,941) and for
Council rates ($3,952), which she has paid out of her own personal resources,
and a possible liability
for land tax in an amount of about $1,500.
<P>

10   	Thus, upon the assumption that the property can be sold
for no less than $300,000, then, after allowance is made for commission
and
legal expenses in respect of such sale, and for the payment of the foregoing
liabilities of the estate (totalling between about
$19,500 and $22,500), it is
likely that the amount available for distribution would be about $270,000 or
perhaps somewhat more. In
that event, each of the four beneficiaries would,
upon distribution, receive an amount of no less than $67,500.
<P>

11   	It will also be appreciated that, in the event that he be
successful in the present proceedings, the plaintiff also will be
entitled to
have his costs paid out of the estate. Those costs are estimated to total about
$24,000. If those costs also are to be
met by the estate, the amount available
for distribution would be reduced to about $246,000. 
<P>

12   	It must be recognised, and emphasised, that unless and
until the Harbord property is sold, neither the plaintiff nor his sisters
will
receive any benefit from the estate of their father.
<P>

13   	I have already recorded that the plaintiff is presently
aged 55. He has never married, although he has a daughter, now aged
24, by a
former de facto relationship. The plaintiff has had no contact with his
daughter for many years.
<P>

14   	The plaintiff in his affidavit evidence recounted the
history of his schooling and his various occupations. It was the plaintiff's
assertion that during his childhood years the deceased was a gambler and a
heavy drinker and, in consequence, failed to fulfil his
responsibilities as a
husband and father. Thus, so it was asserted by the plaintiff, it was necessary
for the plaintiff as the only
other male in the family, to take over many
responsibilities long before he reached adulthood (including, so he said,
financial contributions
towards the acquisition of the Harbord property in
1957, when the plaintiff was aged only fourteen, and towards the household
expenses,
as well as towards the reconstruction of that house after it had been
partially destroyed by fire in about 1958 or 1959). Those assertions
were
denied by the defendant. According to the plaintiff he was always in employment
from the time he left school with the intermediate
certificate in 1960 until he
was involved in a motor accident in 1969, in which he suffered a severe
compound fracture to his left
leg. In his affidavit of 28 April 1998, the
plaintiff said that his life lost direction in the 1970s. He was off work for
eighteen
months, and still continues to suffer residuary physical disabilities
as result of his injury.
<P>

15   	Since his accident the plaintiff has not engaged in
full-time employment (apart from some intermittent work, including 12
months
with one employer, in the early 1970s).
<P>

16   	In 1974 the plaintiff removed to Queensland with his
sister Deidre and her son. For more than 20 years the plaintiff resided
on
portion of a rural property which Deidre purchased at Doonan in that State. A
falling out between the plaintiff and Deidre concerning
that land resulted in
litigation in the Supreme Court of Queensland, which in September 1996 was
decided adversely to the plaintiff.
In consequence, the plaintiff has a
liability to pay the costs of Deidre in respect to that litigation. He also has
a liability for
his own costs, which remain unpaid.
<P>

17   	According to the plaintiff, he lived with and cared for
the deceased from December 1994 until the death of the deceased some
ten months
later. The plaintiff said that it was at the request of the deceased that he
came from Queensland, where he had been residing
to that time, and entered into
occupation with the deceased in the Harbord house; that they remained there
until July 1995, when
the plaintiff and the deceased travelled to Queensland,
where they remained until the death of the deceased. The plaintiff subsequently
returned to the Harbord property, where he continued to reside until 31 August
1998, when he vacated that property as a result of
an order for possession
obtained against him by the defendant.
<P>

18   	The plaintiff did not pay anything by way of rent or
occupation fee for his occupancy of the Harbord property, where he remained
for
almost three years from late 1995 until the end of August 1998. Despite an
agreement by him to be responsible for municipal rates
whilst he was residing
in that property, it has been necessary for the defendant to pay those rates
out of her own pocket.
<P>

19   	I should here observe that there has been no adequate
explanation by the plaintiff as to what happened to an amount of $6,000,
being
funds of the deceased, which were under the control of the plaintiff shortly
before his father's death and which were the subject
of an undertaking given by
the plaintiff to Mr Justice Windeyer on 29 September 1995. 
<P>

20   	The plaintiff's only income is by way of a pension from
the Department of Social Security. He has been receiving such a pension,
which
is now in an amount of $360 a fortnight, since about 1996. According to the
plaintiff that amount is fully expended in maintaining
a frugal lifestyle. 
<P>

21   	The plaintiff is presently residing in the Eversham Hotel
at Manly. His outgoings include rent, $123 a week; food, $30 a week;
garage
rent, $25 a week. In his affidavit of 19 March 1999 the plaintiff said that he
is frequently short of money, and that he obtains
food vouchers from charities
such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society.
<P>

22   	Apart from his interest in the estate of the deceased and
some chattels and personal effects, the plaintiff has no assets.
The plaintiff
has the following liabilities:
<P>

Deidre Hatton - $25,539, being the costs which the plaintiff is liable to pay
in respect to the litigation in the Supreme Court
of Queensland.
<P>

Sandra Elizabeth Young - $19,500, being the costs which the plaintiff is liable
to pay in respect to the probate proceedings in
the Supreme Court of New South
Wales.
<P>

Sandra Elizabeth Young - $1,792, being the costs of the proceedings for
possession of the Harbord property.
<P>

Fosters, solicitors - $19,500, being the plaintiff's own costs in respect to
the probate proceedings.
<P>

23   	The plaintiff, as a son of the deceased, is an eligible
person within paragraph (b) of the definition of that phrase contained
in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. As such, he has the standing
to bring the present proceedings. It will be appreciated that each of the
defendant and the other beneficiaries,
they also being children of the
deceased, is an eligible person in relation to the deceased. 
<P>

24   	In the event that the plaintiff receives only the amount
to which he is entitled under the will of the deceased (being an
amount of
about $67,500, or perhaps a little more), almost the entirety of that amount
will be exhausted in the payment of the various
liabilities of the plaintiff,
which total about $66,000. Those calculations, it will be appreciated, do not
make provision for the
costs of the plaintiff of the present proceedings. In
consequence, therefore, the plaintiff will, in the event that he be
unsuccessful
in the present proceedings, have nothing left over after receiving
his entitlement from the estate of his late father, and, indeed,
will be
subject to a liability for his own costs in an amount of about $24,000, which
it would appear that he has no real likelihood
of being able to pay. 
<P>

25   	In carrying out the first stage of the two-stage process
identified by the High Court of Australia in <i>Singer v Berghouse</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994)
181 CLR 201</a> at 208 -210 per Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ, the relationship
between the plaintiff and the deceased and between the deceased and
other
persons who have a legitimate claim upon his bounty is of relevance. In the
instant case the deceased obviously intended that
each of his four children
should benefit equally from his estate (apart from the gift to the defendant of
the contents of the house
property). 
<P>

26   	Evidence has been placed before the Court concerning the
financial and material circumstances of each of the defendants. 
<P>

27   	Mrs Coles, who by her marriage has three adult children,
divorced in the late 1980s. As a result of a property settlement
in her divorce
Mrs Coles received about $143,000, from which she was able to acquire a house
property at Narrabeen. Whilst residing
in that house property she suffered a
fall, which has given rise to continuing problems of health, both physical and
mental. Since
her accident Mrs Coles has not been in employment. She no longer
owns the Narrabeen property, and as a result of unsatisfactory financial
advice
she has lost about $100,000 of the moneys which she received in her property
settlement. She currently has an amount of between
$30,000 and $40,000 invested
in bonds. 
<P>

28   	Mrs Coles receives an income of about $215 a week by way
of a disability support pension ($180) together with a rent allowance
($35).
She has been receiving that disability pension for about six years. She also
receives some interest upon her investments.

<P>

29   	For about the last eighteen months Mrs Coles has been a
lodger in a home unit at Lismore Avenue Dee Why. She pays $85 a week
and also
contributes to the cost of electricity for accommodation which consisted
originally one room, but now consists of two rooms
in that home unit. She
shares the bathroom and kitchen facilities. 
<P>

30   	It would appear that Mrs Coles owns two caravans, one
located at Warriewood (which is used for storage purposes), and the
other
located on the property of her sister Deidre  at Doonan in Queensland. She
usually visits Deidre once a year, upon which occasions
she resides with a
friend in the caravan. The precise nature the relationship between Mrs Coles
and that friend (who is the owner
of the premises at Dee Why in which she
resides) was somewhat unclear. What emerged with clarity from the evidence of
Mrs Coles,
however, was that on account of her problems with her physical, and
especially her mental, health, the amount to which Mrs Coles
is entitled under
the terms of her father's will should not be significantly reduced as a result
of the present claim made by the
plaintiff. 
<P>

31   	Mrs Hatton (who resides in Queensland and who was not
cross-examined at the hearing) currently resides in a caravan on the
property
at Doonan, which was the subject of the proceedings between Mrs Hatton and the
plaintiff in the Supreme Court of Queensland.
(A copy of the reasons for
judgment of Mr Justice Moynihan, 6 September 1996, is annexed to the affidavit
of Sandra Elizabeth Young,
sworn 3 July 1998.) That property is owned by Mrs
Hatton as to a one half share (the other half share being owned by Mrs Young);
that half share has a current market value of $75,000. The accommodation upon
that property appears to be of a primitive nature,
there being no proper
bathroom, and the water supply consisting of a well. 
<P>

32   	Mrs Hatton subsists on a widow's pension in an amount of
$360 a fortnight. She has liabilities totalling almost $12,000 (including
an
amount for unpaid Council rates of $2,578, upon which interest is accruing).

<P>

33   	Mrs Hatton suffers from attention deficiency hyperactive
disorder. She also suffers from various physical ailments, including
severe
arthritis, migraine, chronic fatigue, heart murmur, and chronic bronchitis. She
currently pays more than $200 a fortnight
for medication, special food and
dietary supplements. 
<P>

34   	Mrs Young married in 1964, and had two children (one of
whom was killed in a motor accident in November 1977). Mrs Young and
her
husband divorced in 1989. She married for a second time in 1994. Mrs Young's
current husband bought out the half share of her
former husband in their
matrimonial home at Davidson. Although that house property is currently
registered in the name of Mrs Young
alone, she expressed the intention of
transferring to her present husband a one half share therein, so that she and
her husband will
then own the house property as joint tenants.
<P>

35   	In addition, Mrs Young is co-owner, with her sister
Deidre, of the property at Doonan in Queensland. She is also the sole
owner of
land at Spencer in New South Wales, which was originally owned jointly by her
mother and herself, and which, upon the death
of her mother in 1991, devolved
upon Mrs Young by survivorship. She has estimated that the present value of the
property at Spencer
(upon which stands a small residence, described as a
weekender) as being $50,000. Apparently there was a mortgage on the property
when it was originally acquired at the instance of Mrs Young's mother, and that
mortgage was paid out by Mrs Young from funds provided
to her by her
husband.
<P>

36   	Mrs Young's husband conducts a business as a fencing and
railing contractor. However, in September 1998 he strained his neck
at work,
and since then has been unable to perform his usual activities, although he
wishes to return to work.
<P>

37   	Mrs Young does not own a motor car, although she owns a
motorcycle. In her affidavit evidence she expressed a desire to effect
some
renovations to the house at Davidson, which is more than thirty years old; and
also to purchase a motor vehicle for her own
use. She wishes also to assist her
adult daughter, who has a daughter of own. 
<P>

38   	It is within the context of the foregoing factual
circumstances that the Court must proceed to a consideration of the claim
of
the plaintiff. 
<P>

39   	I will be appreciated that the financial and material
circumstances of the plaintiff are far from satisfactory. He has no
security of
accommodation. His lifestyle appears to be frugal in the extreme, and he often
has little or no money to purchase food,
and is dependent upon the assistance
of charity in this regard. 
<P>

40   	I recognise that none of the other beneficiaries are in
affluent financial circumstances. Mrs Young is probably in better
circumstances
than Mrs Coles or Mrs Hatton. 
<P>

41   	Whilst Mrs Hatton and Mrs Young each has security of
accommodation, that of Mrs Hatton appears to be primitive in the extreme.

<P>

42   	Were it not for the liabilities of the defendant, arising
out of his various pieces of litigation with his sisters, Mrs Hatton
and Mrs
Young, the plaintiff, if the testamentary provisions of the deceased remained
unchanged, would have had the benefit of about
$67,500 from the estate of his
father. In the context of the financial and material circumstances of at least
two of his sisters
(Mrs Coles and Mrs Hatton) the plaintiff could not have any
legitimate complaint against his father's testamentary dispositions which
gave
to him, and to each of his sisters, such a benefit. That sum would not have
been sufficient to enable him to have purchased
a residence of his own. But in
no possible way could the plaintiff have justified a claim to receive an amount
from his father's
estate entitling him to purchase such a residence. If,
however, he were now able to discharge his liabilities, then he would have
from
the estate a modest capital amount which invested would provide him with some
additional income, which, taken together with
the amount of his pension, would
enable him to acquire rented accommodation. 
<P>

43   	The practical problem is, however, that any additional
benefit given to the plaintiff must, of necessity, reduce the benefits
given to
the other beneficiaries. 
<P>

44   	I would not be disposed to reduce significantly the amount
which either Mrs Coles or Mrs Hatton is entitled to receive out
of the estate
of the deceased. 
<P>

45   	It seems to me that it would be totally unfair to Mrs
Young if the benefit to which she is entitled under the will of the
deceased
were required to bear the major part of any order for provision which might be
made in favour of the plaintiff, in circumstances
where it was Mrs Young, as
executor of the 1991 will, who sought and obtained probate in solemn form of
that will after contested
proceedings. (In those proceedings the plaintiff
sought to establish that that will had been revoked by the deceased, and that,
in
consequence of the transfer of the Harbord property to himself and the
deceased as joint tenants (such transfer having been executed
by the plaintiff
as attorney under power), the plaintiff had by survivorship become the owner of
the entirety of the Harbord property.)
For Mrs Young (or either of her sisters)
by the present proceedings to be deprived of the benefit which she received as
a result
of her success in the probate proceedings would result in those
earlier proceedings now to be seen as having been largely an exercise
in
futility.
<P>

46   	I recognise that the penurious circumstances in which the
plaintiff presently finds himself (and in which he will remain,
even after he
receives a distribution from the proceeds of sale of the Harbord property) are
to a large extent the result of his
liability for costs (both of those of
himself and those of the defendant) in the probate proceedings. That fact does
not of itself
deprive the plaintiff of an order for further provision from the
estate of the deceased.
<P>

47   	I am satisfied that, on account of his present penurious
circumstances, the plaintiff has established an entitlement to some
further
provision from the estate of the deceased, in addition to that to which he is
entitled under the terms of the will. 
<P>

48   	However, the size of the distributable estate and the
competing claims of the other beneficiaries (especially Mrs Coles and
Mrs
Hatton) are such that the amount of any additional benefit from the estate of
the deceased to which I conclude the plaintiff
has established an entitlement
is no more than $40,000. An additional legacy in that amount would provide the
plaintiff (after discharging
his liabilities) with a fund of about $40,000 to
assist him in obtaining rental accommodation and in somewhat improving his very
modest lifestyle.
<P>

49   	I have already recorded that the summons was filed on 12
May 1998. That was some thirteen months after the expiry of the limitation
period of eighteen months from the death of the deceased provided by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16</a>
(1) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. Accordingly, the plaintiff was out of
time in instituting the present proceedings. However, the plaintiff seeks by
his summons an
order that the time for the making of the application be
extended up to and including the date of the filing of the summons.
<P>

50   	In order to explain his failure to commence the
proceedings within the prescribed period, and thus to enliven the discretion
vested in the Court by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16(2)</a> to extend the period for the institution
of the proceedings, the plaintiff relied upon two matters.
<P>

51   	Firstly, he relied upon the probate proceedings, and the
fact that a decision in those proceedings was not given until 21
October 1997.
Up to the time of the delivery of the judgment of Mr Justice Simos, it was the
assertion of the plaintiff that the
document relied upon him in those
proceedings gave to him the Harbord property, and it was not until those
proceedings were concluded
that the ultimate distribution of the estate of the
deceased was known. The plaintiff further relied upon his assertion that it was
not until March 1998 that he became aware of his entitlement to make a claim
under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. The present proceedings were instituted
very shortly thereafter, in May 1998. 
<P>

52   	It was suggested on behalf of the defendant that it was
unlikely that the plaintiff, who had had legal representation in the
probate
proceedings, would have been unaware of an entitlement to make a claim under
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. Nevertheless, although cross-examined on this
point, the plaintiff remained unshaken in his evidence. 
<P>

53   	But, in any event, in the light of the manner in which the
probate proceedings were conducted, it seems to me that the plaintiff
was
entitled to obtain a decision in those proceedings, in order to ascertain how
the estate of the deceased would be distributed,
before embarking upon what
might be described as an inconsistent proceeding in the Equity Division,
seeking an order for provision
under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. 
<P>

54   	In those circumstances, therefore, it seems to me
appropriate, since I have expressed the view that the plaintiff has otherwise
established an entitlement to further provision out of the estate in addition
to that which he will receive under the terms of the
will, for the Court to
extend the time for the making of the present application.
<P>

55   	Accordingly, I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	I order that the time for the making of this application be extended up to
and including the date of the filing of the summons
herein.
<P>

2.	I order that, in addition to the benefits given to him by the will of the
late John Albert Cleary ("the deceased"), the plaintiff
receive a legacy in the
sum of $40,000, such legacy not to bear interest if paid on or before 27
November 1999.
<P>

3.	I order that the costs of the plaintiff on the party and party basis and the
costs of the defendant on the indemnity basis be
paid out of the estate of the
deceased.
<P>

4.	The exhibits may be returned.
