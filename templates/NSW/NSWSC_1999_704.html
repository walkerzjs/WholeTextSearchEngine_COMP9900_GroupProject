(NSW)</i> )</b>
<P>

1   	Mr Vincent Allan Polkinghorne is to be indicted for that
he, on 26 July 1996, at Lavington in the State of New South Wales,
did murder
Donna Maree Conibear.
<P>

2   	On 12 July the indictment was presented by the learned
Crown Prosecutor to the initiate the proceedings to enable the determination
of
a question of the admissibility of certain evidence.  
<P>

3   	Exhibit A as on the voir dire is a folder containing a
notice under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 67</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (NSW)</i> and the statements of
the relevant witnesses, together with the evidence given at committal, touching
upon the material the subject
of consideration.
<P>

4   	An "<i>agreed"</i> summary of facts for the purposes of
argument is as follows:  
<P>

5   	The deceased, Donna Maree Conibear was stabbed at about 2
am on Friday 26 July 1996 in the main bedroom of residential premises
at 376
Woomera Crescent, Lavington.  At the time the stab wound was inflicted the
deceased was lying on her stomach in the bed under
bed clothes which included a
doona.  The knife used to inflict the wound was left in the doona. 
<P>

6   	At about 2 am on 26 July 1996 the deceased attended the
home of her mother, Mrs Yvonne Conibear at 380 Woomera Crescent, Lavington.
Mrs Yvonne Conibear contacted Mrs Lorraine (Lainie) Dunlop who lived at 378
Woomera Crescent.  Mrs Dunlop soon thereafter attended
the resident of Mrs
Yvonne Conibear.  Mrs Lorraine Dunlop called an ambulance.  At about 2.16 am on
26 July 1996 ambulance officers
Petrie and Steer attended.  
<P>

7   	The deceased was then transported to the Albury Base
Hospital were treatment, including a thoracotomy was administered.  She
died at
approximately 3.30 am on 26 July 1996 at the hospital.
<P>

8   	A post-mortem examination was conducted on 29 July 1996 by
Dr Peter Bradhusrt.  His finding included (a) the deceased died
of a single
stab wound to the back of the left chest penetrating the lower lobe of the left
lung and entering into the cavity of
the left ventricle of the heart;  (b) the
left lung collapsed;  (c) there was a left haemothorax 1000ml;  (d) there were
no "<i>defensive wounds or injuries"</i>:  this is consistent with the deceased
lying on her stomach at the time the wound was inflicted;  (e) the stab wound
was consistent
with having been caused by the knife left in the doona.  
<P>

9   	The knife which was in the doona was similar to four other
knives found in the kitchen of the premises.
<P>

10   	The evidence which the Crown seeks to have admitted is a
statement by the deceased, "<i>Mum, Vin stabbed me"</i> made in response to an
inquiry "<i>What's the matter mate?"</i> by the deceased's mother upon the
deceased coming to her house.  
<P>

11   	There are two other statements of which evidence can be
given by Mr Petrie, ambulance officer, which were made by the deceased
subsequent in time to the representation made by her to her mother.  Those
statements were to the effect of an answer "<i>I don't know</i>" when asked
"<i>What happened?"</i>  Further, Mr Petrie can give evidence as to an
observation he made of the deceased in the ambulance in response to the
question to
the effect "<i>Who did this?"</i> that she gave no oral reply but
instead looked blankly out of the window of the ambulance.  
<P>

12   	The Crown relies upon <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)(b)</a> and (c) of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (NSW)</i> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s72.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 72</a> of the same legislation.
<P>

13   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 65(2)(b)</a> and (c) is as follows:
<P>

<i>"(2)	The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous
representation that is given by a person who saw, heard, or otherwise
perceived
the representation being made, if the representation was:</i>
<P>

<i>...</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in
circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a
fabrication,
or </i>
<P>

<i>(c)	made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the
representation is reliable, ..."</i>
<P>

14   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s72.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 72</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (NSW)</i> (headed
"<i>Exception:  Contemporaneous Statements About a Person's Health, etc."</i>),
is as follows:
<P>

<i>"72.	The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a representation made by
a person that was a contemporaneous representation about
the person's health,
feelings, sensation, intention, knowledge or state of mind".</i>
<P>

15   	I am informed and accept that there is no authority
directly on point in respect of this precise kind of evidence and its
admissibility under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (NSW)</i>.
<P>

16   	Accordingly, the approach was adopted by considering the
general law commencing with the decision of the High Court in <b><i>Walton v
The Queen</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/9.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 9</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%2d1988%29%20166%20CLR%20283" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987-1988) 166 CLR 283</a> holding to the effect that evidence
of a relevant out of Court statement is admissible to prove the maker's
knowledge or state of
mind in a case where the knowledge or state is itself a
fact in issue or is provable (as against the party against whom the evidence
is
tendered) as a fact relevant to a fact in issue:  see Wilson, Gaudron &amp;
Toohey JJ especially at 300-301.
<P>

17   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 65(2)(b)</a>, it is submitted, is probably the closest
test in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (NSW) </i>to that which is referred to by Lord
Wilberforce in <b><i>Ratten v The Queen</i></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1971/1971_23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1971] UKPC 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%20AC%20378" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] AC 378</a> at 388F to 389E,
where his Lordship said:
<P>

<i> "The possibility of concoction, or fabrication, where it exists, is on the
other hand an entirely valid reason for exclusion, and
is probably the real
test which judges in fact apply.  In their Lordships' opinion this should be
recognised and applied directly
as the relevant test:  the test should be not
the uncertain one whether the making of the statement was in some sense part of
the
event or transaction.  This may often be difficult to establish:  such
external matters as the time which elapses between the events
and the speaking
of the words (or vice versa), and differences in location being relevant
factors but not, taken by themselves, decisive
criteria.  As regard statements
made after the event it must be for the judge, by preliminary ruling, to
satisfy himself that the
statement was so clearly made in circumstances of
spontaneity or involvement in the event that the possibility of concoction can
be disregarded.  Conversely, if he considers that the statement was made by way
of narrative of a detached prior event to that the
speaker was so disengaged
from it as to be able to construct or adapt his account, he should exclude it.
And the same must in principle
be true of statements made before the event.
The test should be not the uncertain one, whether the making of the statement
should
be regarded as part of the event or transaction.  This may often be
difficult to show.  But if the drama, leading up to the climax,
has commenced
and assumed such intensity and pressure that the utterance can safely be
regarded as a true reflection of what was
unrolling or actually happening, it
ought to be received.  The expression `res gestae' may conveniently sum up
these criteria, but
the reality of them must always be kept in mind:  it is
this that lies behind the best reasoned of the judges' rulings".</i>
<P>

18   	This component of Lord Wilberforce's speech which
constituted the Advice of the Privy Council, was considered by Barwick CJ
in
<b><i>Vocisano v Vocisano</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1974/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1974] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%2d1974%29%20130%20CLR%20267" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973-1974) 130 CLR 267</a> at 272-3:
<P>

<i>"The question of whether statements form part of a res gestae is fraught
with difficulty at any time.  In the present case, the learned
trial judge
relied upon the views expressed by the Privy council when giving its advice
in<b> Ratten v The Queen</b>... A reason for the doctrine that statements made
as part of the res are admissible as evidence is that, because of their
contemporaneity
and the circumstances of their making, they were unlikely to be
concocted and therefore might well be reliable:"  but that does not
mean that
statements made on an occasion when they are unlikely to be concocted are for
that reason admissible.  It is the contemporaneous
involvement of the speaker
at the time the statement is made with the occurrence which is identified as
the res which founds admissibility.
 In <b>Ratten's Case</b>, Lord Wilberforce
seems to have regarded the relevant occurrence as the `drama' which began when
it may be supposed a threat to kill
his wife was made by the appellant in that
case and which ended with her death.  So regarded, the telephone call was
necessarily
involved in the occurrence and the deceased's statement to the
telephonist clearly contemporaneously identified with it"</i>
<P>

19   	The learned Crown also referred me to the transcript of
argument before the High Court in <b><i>Papakosmas v The Queen</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s139.html" class="autolink_findacts">S139/98</a>
(5 March 1999) which has yet to be decided.  At pages 16 and 17 there is an
indication that the old decision of <b><i>Reg v Bedingfield</i></b> (1879) 14
Cox's Criminal Cases 341 had "<i>bitten the dust"</i>.  It seems that Gleeson
CJ was apparently in agreement with that proposition as to the curious
authority of that decision of Cockburn
CJ excluding both as a dying declaration
and as part of the <i>res gestae</i> the well known statement of the deceased
"<i>See what Harry has done!"</i>  If the exchange referred to in the
transcript evolves into an authoritative statement of the High Court in
judgment in <b><i>Papakosmas</i></b> then the law of evidence will be well
served.
<P>

20   	Thus, it is submitted for the Crown for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
65(2)(b)</a> that there is no material available here which could lead to any other
conclusion than that it was unlikely that the representation
made by the
deceased to her mother was a fabrication.  It was a spontaneous remark in the
sense that it happened within a very short
time of the stabbing itself - within
minutes - that is, shortly after the "<i>drama</i>" referred to by Lord
Wilberforce leading up to the climax, had commenced and assumed such intensity
and pressure that the utterance
can safely be regarded as a true reflection of
what was unrolling or what actually happened.  
<P>

21   	For the Crown reliance is also placed on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)(c)</a> and an
apparent concession was made that that was more "<i>problematic"</i> for the
Crown given the statements of testimony that could be given by the ambulance
officers.  This goes to the question of reliability.
<P>

22   	It is to be borne in mind that I am concerned with the
admissibility of the statement to the mother and whether it was made
in
circumstances that make it <i>"highly probable</i> <i>that the representation
is reliable".</i>  What the Crown seems to be concerned about is the two later
statements being available to affect the question of the probability
of
reliability.  However the statements made to the ambulance officers are
separate representations and must themselves be subject
to the admissibility
requirements of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2).</a>  
<P>

23   	If the statement twice made to the ambulance officer
subsequent to the critical statement made to the mother are admissible,
they
may arguably go to the circumstances of the making by the deceased of the
statement to the mother.  This proposition which I
sought to articulate during
the course of submissions does not appear to me to have been developed.  For
the purposes of determining
the admissibility of the statement made by the
deceased to the mother nothing in the "<i>circumstances"</i> of her making it
to her mother arguably derogates from its reliability.  Equally arguably the
circumstances in which the subsequent
representations were made to the
ambulance officers could make it highly probable that those representations
were unreliable by reason
of, applying one's common sense in the absence of
expert evidence, the deterioration in the physical condition of the deceased.

<P>

24   	For the moment therefore I am inclined to the view that if
this material is admissible under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65</a> it is admissible under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)(b)</a> and
(c) without recourse to the determination of the admissibility of the quite
separate representations made by the deceased to
another witness, namely the
ambulance officer.
<P>

25   	It is also argued for the Crown, as I have said, that the
statement would be admissible hearsay by reason of it being contemporaneous
representation for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s72.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 72.</a>  It is certainly clear that any
separate representations made by the deceased to the ambulance officer verbally
(as opposed to the
physical observation of her response to a question), would
not be admissible under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s72.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 72</a> because the response does not fall within any of
the matters therein referred to.  I must say I have great difficulty with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s72.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 72</a>
notwithstanding the "<i>contemporaneity</i>" component in the sense that on one
reading of it arguably in respect to contemporaneous statements it renders the
whole of the hearsay
exclusionary rules irrelevant in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>.
The section makes sense, in my view, up to the point where it deals with
"<i>health, feelings and sensations</i>".  It is the inclusion of the words
"<i>intention, knowledge, or state of mind"</i> that give rise to problems.  As
Mr Odgers has remarked in his learned text does "<i>knowledge"</i> and
"<i>state of mind</i>" include "<i>belief</i>" or <i>"memory</i>"?  No
authority was cited to me in the course of argument on this very curious and
vexing question.  This reinforces the view that
I have that the determination
will depend upon the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)(b)</a> and (c).  It was further argued on
behalf of the Crown that in the event that I find the evidence admissible
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65</a> the tests for the exercise of the discretions in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p3.11" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3.11</a> of
the Act <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 135</a>-<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">137</a>) will have been satisfied.
<P>

26   	Mr Molomby for the accused approached the question by
examining <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)(c)</a> first.  He argued that what the drafters of the
legislation had in mind have not been achieved by the wording of the relevant
sections.
 If what was sought to be achieved was the coming to a conclusion
about the high probability of reliability, the wrong set of
<i>"circumstances"</i> have been addressed.  As I understand the submission it
is the circumstances of the <i>relating</i> of the event perceived or observed
rather than the <i>event itself</i> which are relied upon to determine
reliability.  In other words, the test of reliability is confined to the
circumstances of the
narration and thus, the reliability of the representation,
cannot "<i>logically</i>" be established only by the circumstances of the
narration.  It is argued that it just cannot logically be done, that is, one
establishes
how reliable what someone is saying about something that happened
by looking only at the transaction between the narrator and the
person to whom
the account is given.
<P>

27   	It is submitted that it would be impossible for the Court
in this case to determine the reliability of the narration from
the
circumstances in which it was made to the mother.  What was said by Mr Molomby
was "<i>it would be a totally irrational proposition to assert that the
reliability of the original observation could be established by the
circumstances in which it was narrated</i>" (T13.10).  
<P>

28   	In the context of Mr Molomby's own submissions the
extracted part really is contradictory.  It is fundamental to Mr Molomby's
submission that the legislature has enacted the "<i>wrong test</i>" by
referring to the circumstances of the narration rather the circumstances of the
original observation of the event being narrated.
 It is not the reliability of
the observation of the actual circumstances that is being tested, even on Mr
Molomby's own argument,
it is the reliability of the narration of the
observations as to what happened.  
<P>

29   	Be all that as it may, whilst it may well be arguable
along the lines that the legislature has chosen the "<i>wrong test"</i>, the
test still remains that contained in the wording of the section itself which
refers to the circumstances of the narration.
<P>

30   	It seems to me that what the legislature has done is to
focus upon the reliability of the narration of the events to determine
the
admissibility of the evidence of that narration as going to the proof of the
events themselves.  The question of admissibility
is one thing, the question of
ultimate proof is another, of course.
<P>

31   	In this regard I must say I agree with some statements
made by Sperling J in <b><i>Regina v Mankotia</i> </b>(unreported, 27 July
1998) at 5 and 6, to which I will return shortly.
<P>

32   	I am unable to accept the submission for the accused made
by Mr Molomby.  Indeed, when one reads what Lord Wilberforce said
in
<b><i>Ratten</i></b> at 389 there is not the slightest suggestion that the test
there expounded by him involves an examination by the event as opposed
to the
examination of the narration of it.
<P>

33   	In relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)(b)</a>, the same argument is advanced
in relation to that component of the paragraph of the subsection that refers to
"<i>circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a
fabrication"</i> - that is, one must look at the circumstances of the event
being narrated rather than the narration itself.  With that I have dealt.
<P>

34   	The second component of Mr Molomby's submission is a very
interesting one in relation to this subsection which opens with
the words
"<i>made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred"</i>.  "<i>Asserted
fact"</i> is defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s59.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 59</a> which provides:
<P>

<i>"(1)	Evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not
admissible to prove the existence of a fact that the person intended
to assert
by their representation.</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	Such a fact is in this Part referred to as an <b>asserted
fact</b>".</i>
<P>

35   	By reason of that definition, it is submitted, there is
requirement that consideration should be given to whether the "<i>asserted
fact</i>" occurred at all.  How else can it be determined, it is argued,
whether the representation was made "<i>shortly after</i>" the asserted fact
occurred or how could it be determined "<i>when</i>" the representation was
made without a determination of when and therefore, whether the asserted fact,
indeed as a matter of fact,
took place?
<P>

36   	It is submitted that if the legislature had intended to
focus upon the question of timing in relation to the asserted fact
the relevant
subparagraph would read as follows, "<i>made when or shortly after the asserted
fact </i><cite>is asserted to have</cite><i> occurred"</i> (emphasis added).
<P>

37   	I think there are two available responses to the
propositions advanced in this context by Mr Molomby.  First are the terms
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s59.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
59(1)</a> which speaks of a previous representation not being admissible to prove
the existence of a fact that the person intended to assert
by the
representation.  That section, in my view, is concerned with the
<i>assertion</i> as to a fact and the word "<i>assertion"</i> used in that
exclusionary rule provision (to preclude the proof of the existence of the
fact) must, to make any sense at all for
the very existence of the rule, be a
reference to what a person was saying that a fact was, as distinct from direct
evidence of that
fact.  
<P>

38   	The second basis is the sheer impracticality of the
proposition advanced in terms of the other sections of the Act whether
relating
to exceptions in civil proceedings <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">(ss 63</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">64</a>), or indeed, to the
restriction in subsection (2) as to "<i>first hand hearsay</i>".  If a question
arises in relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)</a> as to whether a person had personal knowledge of
the asserted fact, is it to be taken that the asserted fact would have to be
independently
proved to determine whether or not the person has personal
knowledge of it or that that knowledge might reasonably be supposed to
have
been based on something that the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived
(other than a previous representation made by another
person about the fact)?
In my view, it is not to be so taken.  
<P>

39   	In <b><i>Mankotia</i></b> Sperling J said (at 5-6):  
<P>

<i>"<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">S65(2)(b)</a> prescribes two conditions for its operation.  First, the
representation must have been made contemporaneously with the asserted fact
(that is, the fact intended to be asserted by the representation:  see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s59.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 59(1))</a>
or shortly thereafter.</i>
<P>

<i>The phrase `shortly after' is not defined.  The legislature has chosen not
to specify a time.  That implies that a normative judgment
is to be made
dependent on the circumstances of the case.  For a judgment to be made,
considerations of some kind or other have to
be taken into account but - as in
the case of normative judgments generally - it may be difficult or impossible
to articulate in
a precise way what they are.  I think the predominant factor
in the phrase `shortly after' must be the actual time that has elapsed
and
whether that fits the ordinary usage of the expression `shortly after' in the
circumstances of the case.  The judgment should,
however, be influenced by the
policy behind the provision.  That is to put a brake on evidence being given of
a recollection which
may have faded in its accuracy with the passage of time.
The judgment may therefore be influenced by the subject matter of the event
and
by how long the memory of such an event is likely to have remained clear in the
mind.</i>
<P>

<i>The second condition prescribed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)(b)</a> is that the representation was
made in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation was a
fabrication.  The test is
not one of reliability at large.  It is a narrower
test.  First it is the unlikelihood of concoction to which the paragraph is
directed.
 Whether the representor might have been honestly mistaken is
immaterial.  Secondly, it is not unlikelihood at large which is in
question,
but unlikelihood arising from the circumstances.</i>
<P>

<i>I would construe `circumstances' to mean the circumstances in which the
representation was made, its </i><cite>factual setting at the time it was
made</cite><i>.  That construction has the effect of excluding from
consideration, for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)(b)</a>, events subsequent to the
representation being made and other representations made by the same person on
other occasions, notwithstanding
that such considerations might logically
fortify the unlikelihood of concoction or (in the case of inconsistent
representations)
have the opposite effect.  The same point arises in relation
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)(c)</a></i>" (emphasis added).
<P>

40   	I respectfully agree with what his Honour there said in
respect of the essential submissions underpinning the defence position
in
relation to the operation of the two sub-paragraphs of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2).</a>
<P>

41   	A further submission made by Mr Molomby in relation to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
65(2)(b)</a> is as to the word "<i>fabrication</i>".  To my understanding the word
"<i>fabrication"</i> in ordinary English means something that is "<i>made
up</i>".  Technically it means, of course, something constructed or put
together or simply made.  What Mr Molomby has submitted, and it
is again a very
interesting submission, is that the sub-section does not take into account a
"<i>fabrication</i>" that is "<i>innocent</i>".
<P>

42   	In this regard Mr Molomby contends that there is some
guidance in the Act that "<i>fabrication</i>" can include an innocent
fabrication namely, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 108(3).</a>  If a "<i>fabrication</i>" is to be understood in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)(b)</a> as inclusive of an innocent fabrication, then that creates what Mr
Molomby describes as a "<i>false construct of evidence"</i> which I understand
to mean the quality of evidence to which the intended purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65</a> could
not conceivably relate to make it admissible. 
<P>

43   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 108(3)</a> is concerned with an exception to the
Credibility Rule (s 102) and with "<i>re-establishing credibility</i>".
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 108(3)(b)</a> provides that the credibility rule does not apply to evidence
of a prior consistent statement of a witness if  "<i>(b) it is or will be
suggested, (either expressly or by implication)</i> <i>that evidence given by
the witness has been fabricated or reconstructed (</i><cite>whether
deliberately or otherwise</cite><i>) or is the result of a suggestion"</i>
(emphasis added).
<P>

44   	This is an ingenious, and I say that with respect, and a
very interesting argument.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 108(3)(b)</a> it must however be borne in mind
is concerned with the credibility rule.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 65(2)</a> is concerned with the
admissibility of evidence to prove a fact.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 108(3)(b)</a> is triggered by
evidence having been given and thus, of course, having been admitted and the
testing of its credibility by that mechanism
which I construe <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s108.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 108(3)(b)</a>
solely to be directed.
<P>

45   	Upon my reading of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)(b)</a> "<i>fabrication" </i>has
that ordinary meaning that founds such statements of principle as are set out
in <b><i>Ratten</i></b> and <b><i>Walton</i></b>.
<P>

46   	It was also submitted for the accused in the context of
the proof of the asserted fact that the problem would not be so acute,
if it
exists at all, if there was independent evidence of it.  That may be so.  It is
the second alternative namely, the requirement
of a conduct of a voir dire
which would involve the hearing of the whole of the Crown case which was
reluctantly offered as the only
basis on which to resolve the issues raised by
Mr Molomby's propositions.  Although I have rejected those propositions, the
notion
of conducting a "<i>voir dire</i>" has itself not been without mention.
In <b><i>Ratten</i></b> at 391 Wilberforce LJ said as follows:
<P>

<i>"Before applying it to the facts of the present case, there is one other
matter to be considered, namely the nature of the proof required
to establish
the involvement of the speaker in the pressure of the drama, or the
concatenation of events leading up to the crisis.
 On principle it would not
appear right that that necessary association should be shown only by the
statement itself, otherwise the
statement would be lifting itself into the area
of admissibility.  There is little authority on this point.  In <b>Reg v
Taylor</b> [1961(3)] S.A.L.R. 616 where witnesses said they had heard scuffles
and thuds during which the deceased cried out "John, please don't
hit me any
more, you will kill me," Fannin J said that it would be unrealistic to require
the examination of the question (sc. of
close relationship) without reference
to the terms of the statement sought to be proved.  `Often the only evidence as
to how near
in time the making of the statement was to the act it relates to,
and the actual relationship between the two, will be contained
in the statement
itself,' (p 619).  Facts differ so greatly that it is difficult to imagine a
case where there is no evidence at
all of connection between the statement and
principal event other than the statement itself, but whether this is
sufficiently shown
must be a matter for the trial judge.  Their Lordships would
be disposed to agree that, amongst other things, he make take the statement
itself into account".</i>
<P>

47   	And in <b><i>Mankotia</i></b> at 6 Sperling J said:
<P>

<i>"The argument has given rise to no serious difficulties in the present case.
But what if it were seriously in dispute as to whether
the accused killed the
deceased?  There would have to be a trial within a trial.  And, in the present
case, the same approach would
entitle the Crown to prove that the killing was
done with an intention to kill, and without provocation for that matter, all of
which
would be logically relevant to whether a prior representation that the
accused had threatened to kill the deceased was unlikely to
be a fabrication or
was highly probable to be reliable.  The Crown would be entitled to call
virtually the whole of its case on the
voir dire and the accused would be
entitled not only to test it but to answer it by evidence on the voir dire.
This cannot have been
intended".</i>
<P>

48   	With respect I agree with what is both explicit and
implicit in what Sperling J said as to the non-availability of such a
course on
the determination of an issue such as this.
<P>

49   	Thus, I am not persuaded that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 65(2)(b)</a> or (c) operates
to exclude the proposed testimony from the deceased's mother of what her
daughter said to her.  Nothing that has
been placed before me persuades me that
when the statement was made it was likely that the representation was a
fabrication (it being
made shortly after the asserted fact occurred as I have
understood the expression "<i>asserted fact"), </i>or that it is highly
probable that the representation was unreliable. 
<P>

50   	If I determined that the evidence is admissible, it is
urged upon me that in the exercise of my discretion I should exclude
it on the
basis that its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice
to the accused <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 137).</a>
<P>

51   	It is to be noted that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 137</a> speaks of "<i>the danger of
unfair prejudice</i>".  Unfair prejudice to the party against whom the evidence
is tendered is not established by the mere fact that the evidence has
only
slight probative value:  nor is it established because it may (quite properly)
reduce the effect of that party's case.  There
must be shown to be a danger
that the tribunal of fact will use the evidence upon a basis logically
unconnected with the issue in
the case:  <b><i>R v Lockyer</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2091%20A%20Crim%20R%20356" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 91 A
Crim R 356</a>;  <b><i>Pfennig v The Queen</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%20182%20CLR%20461" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 182 CLR 461.</a>  The onus
remains on the accused under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 137</a> to persuade the trial judge that the danger
of unfair prejudice from the evidence outweighs its probative value.  The
section provides
that the evidence <i>must</i> be excluded once the judge is
persuaded of that fact:  <b><i>Regina v Lock</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2091%20A%20Crim%20R%20356" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 91 A Crim R 356</a> at
364 per Hunt CJ at CL.
<P>

52   	The probative value of the evidence ruled to be admissible
as an exception to the hearsay, Mr Molomby argues, is dramatically
affected by
the responses to the ambulance officers hitherto referred to, they having the
quality of seriously undermining the effect
of the original utterance.  The
realistic approach, it is said, is that there is someone in the house in the
circumstances namely
the victim who was on her face in bed covered up and is
stabbed.  There is only one other adult in that house normally, the accused.
She is in a state of evident distress for obvious reasons and, it is said,
"<i>jumps to a conclusion</i>" that the accused must have stabbed her, coming
to that conclusion after some time in the house of her mother when being cared
for.
 Her responses to the ambulance officer to the effect "<i>I don't
know"</i>, could represent very plausibly and conceivably the true position in
the circumstances:  namely, she had made no observation but
had reached a
conclusion.  That view of the admissible testimony impacts upon its probative
effect.  Trite thought it is to say,
of course, the actual witness is not
available to be cross-examined particularly on what is said to be the critical
aspect as to
whether her utterance represents a statement of an observation she
made or a conclusion at which she arrived.  Save for the statement
made to the
mother there is no other "<i>narration</i>", which factor is also said to be
suggestive of a conclusion rather than an observation.  Other matters include,
of course, the fact
that there will be shown to be no other wound apart from
the fatal one, the inference being available that the victim did not act
defensively and therefore did not see that the stabbing was coming.  The
inference is also available that she awoke in panic and
distress proffering
confused thoughts.  The very emotional circumstances attending what befell the
deceased and the fact that statement
was made to her mother could contribute to
a statement in these circumstances being given greater weight than it deserves:
that,
I understand, to be a reference to the danger that the tribunal of fact
will use the evidence on a basis logically unconnected with
issues.  The
evidence ruled to be admissible is, of course, logically connected with the
fundamental issue in the case, namely whether
the Crown proves beyond
reasonable doubt that the accused stabbed the deceased.
<P>

53   	Other matters to which Mr Molomby referred was the
apparent existence of evidence that a motor vehicle was observed by the
witness
Mrs Dunlop leaving the location at the time "<i>all this fuss was taking
place</i>".  That is, I am to be taken to understand, the time the victim was
going to her mother's house.  The accused does not drive a car.
 He has an
impairment to his eye sight that makes him see in focus, as-it-were, things
only about two inches in front of his face.
<P>

54   	These matters, of course, may ultimately have some effect
upon evidence which presently can be characterised as of probative
value in the
principle issue in the trial as well as being, by its very nature, prejudicial.

<P>

55   	Of course the utterer of the statement is unavailable to
be cross-examined.  The recipient of it is.  The recipient of the
statements
made to the ambulance officers are available to be cross-examined.  The
representation directly involves the accused and
he, of course, can give sworn
evidence in relation to it and to the matter as a whole.  He is able to place
his own version before
the jury (cf.  <b><i>Regina v Brett John Dean</i></b>
(Dunford, J, unreported, 23 March 1997) at 3;  <b><i>Regina v George Daniel
Morish</i></b> (Hidden J, unreported, 4 October 1996) at 6).
<P>

56   	Thus I am not persuaded to exercise my discretion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
137</a>, not being persuaded that, notwithstanding the prejudicial effect of the
evidence admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule,
that there is a danger
of unfair prejudice.  It is to be borne in mind also that the jury can and no
doubt probably will receive
appropriate directions.
<P>

57   	There remains what I must confess to finding as curious a
factual matter that arose during the course of submissions.  This
is
constituted by the material in Exhibit 1 which is a statement dated 6 September
1997 by Dr Neil Blair of the Albury Base Hospital.
 It refers to what appears
to be the fact that at about the time or shortly after the incident the accused
was involved in a motor
vehicle accident, that is, he was apparently, in the
early hours of 26 July 1996, hit by a truck sustaining a close head injury.
<P>

58   	I do not see the relevance of the material relating to
these facts, if they be facts, to the question of the admissibility
of the
subject testimony.  These facts might have other relevance in the trial
generally but for present purposes I do not understand
them to be pertinent.
<P>

59   	Accordingly, I rule that evidence of the statement made by
the deceased to her mother will be admitted.
<P>
