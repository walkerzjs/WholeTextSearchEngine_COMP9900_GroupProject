	<b>JUDGMENT  </b>(Subpoena to plaintiff to produce documents - solicitor's
files)
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:   On 28 January this year the solicitors for the defendant issued
a subpoena directed to the plaintiff, which subpoena
it is to be noted is
addressed to the plaintiff in his capacity, as I read the first part of the
document, as a partner in the firm
of Marsdens at the corner of Queen and
Dumaresque Street, Campbelltown.
<P>

2	The schedule to the subpoena, in its first part, is in the following
terms:
<P>

	<i>"All records, documents, files, correspondence, notes, memoranda, audio
tapes, statements, court documents, computer printouts and
computer discs
relating to instructions received by Marsdens Solicitors in the period 1 July
1973 to 30 June 1988 from or on behalf
of the following people."</i>
<P>

3	There is then set out six names. Thus far it can be remarked that the
material sought in relation to the six names covers fifteen
years.
<P>

4	For the recipient of the subpoena, the plaintiff, it is contended, first,
that it should be set aside as the contents of the schedule
expose no
conceivable relationship to the subject of the proceedings, and thus amounts to
an abuse of the Court's process.
<P>

5	Secondly, and linked with the first proposition, is that by the very nature
of the wording of the schedule the exercise is what
is described as
"<i>fishing</i>", one possible explanation for the fishing being advanced being
a desire on the part of the defendant to "<i>dredge up</i>" material that might
support further allegations in relation to defences, no doubt particularly that
of justification.
<P>

6	It is next contended that the wording of the schedule on its face indicates
that the subpoena is directed to the production of
material that is manifestly
privileged. Pausing there, as I understand the position in relation to people
named in the schedule,
all expect (b) and (c) have given instructions to the
plaintiff to assert privilege. In relation to (b) and (c) the plaintiff is
awaiting advice as to whether those people propose to assert privilege.
<P>

7	With respect to the person (d), that person is deceased and a similar
situation applies in relation to that person insofar as
inquiries are being
made as to the existence of anyone who can either require the privilege to be
asserted or waive it.
<P>

8	In the context of the current application I understand that nothing as yet
turns on the matters I have just recited but it is
in my view important at this
stage that they be  recorded.
<P>

9	In response to the "<i>no conceivable relationship" </i>submission, the
defendant commences with a reference to lines 179-182 of the Amended Schedule A
to the Second Further Amended Statement
of Claim in action number 20223 of 1995
which is concerned with the first program.
<P>

10	That reference is to the defendant's publication of statements made by a Mr
Ron Dunbier, a particularly relevant part of which
statement is
<P>

	"<i>through discussions with some of the boys ... and through having worked on
files pertaining to those boys who are clients of the practice..."</i>
<P>

11	To put that in context, the defendant published a statement by Mr Quail that
Mr Dunbier was, at the time of publication John
Marsden's former legal
partner.
<P>

12	In defence of the publication, the defendant contends that the occasion of
the publication of the matter giving rise to the defamatory
imputations is
protected by privilege under s 22 of the Defamation Act, in which regard the
reasonableness of the conduct of the
defendant in publishing is a critical
issue to which is connected the information in the possession of the defendant
at the time
of the publication, and a belief that the defendant had in relation
to that information.
<P>

13	So it is argued for the defendant the particular passage in the program in
the context of the defence and the components of reasonableness,
information
and belief to which I have just referred, founds the area of relevance.
<P>

14	Further, and here I am in a position where I have to and am content to rely
upon information provided from the Bar table as to
the discovery process that
has hitherto taken place between the parties, that which the defendant
published in the first program
which was made up of statements made by Mr
Dunbier, I gather, is part of a statement made by Mr Dunbier of great length,
which statement
has been discovered by the defendant. I accept also that that
discovered document names all but one of the people referred to in
the schedule
to the subpoena.
<P>

15	A more focused area of relevance in answer to Mr McHugh's first complaint
about the subpoena is a particular of justification
which is particular 5(4) on
page 10 of the Further Amended Defence to the Second Further Amended Statement
of Claim which is a specific
reference to D6 who is the person (b) named in the
schedule to the subpoena.
<P>

16	I accept in the light of all that I have just said on the question of
relevance that a response has been made to the first proposition
advanced by Mr
McHugh.
<P>

17	In other words at this point of time in the light of information I have
heard, I presently cannot accept the proposition that
the subpoena as it
presently stands can be characterised as having "<i>no conceivable relevance"
</i>to the issues of this case, but that of course does not necessarily lead to
a finding that it should stand, or if it does stand, that
there should be
unhindered or unfettered compliance with it.
<P>

18	To a very great extent the second submission made by Mr McHugh is covered by
what I have already referred to in dealing with
the overall relevance, that is
I am not  presently persuaded that it can be described as "fishing".
<P>

19	The third proposition is that the material is manifestly privileged.
Assuming that each of these persons referred to has been
a client of the
plaintiff, and assuming that in relation to any matter of instructions, files
were created, it is clearly the case
that not every document in such a file or
files in relation to any particular client attracts client privilege. Equally,
and this
I understand to be acknowledged for the defendant, matters of
instructions and matters constituting the provision of advice would
attract
privilege.
<P>

20	In relation to the first it is to be noted that the schedule to the subpoena
seeks a corpus of material referred to in detail
as "<i>relating to
instructions</i>" which could incline the court forthwith to set aside the
subpoena, as if the subpoena for example had been framed as requiring the
production of this corpus of material "<i>relating to advice given</i>". That
would be a clearer case.
<P>

21	But as has been submitted the phrase "<i>relating to</i>" is rather elusive
in lending itself to clear definition in this context, and thus I am not
prepared, on that limited basis, namely
merely because all this material sought
is "<i>relating to</i> <i>instructions"</i>, to set aside the subpoena.
<P>

22	The principal matter of concern is given the relevance at this stage in a
general way of the material sought to be adduced under
the subpoena, as a
practical exercise for the plaintiff to deal with, it could be an oppressive
task. In this regard I note that
there has been delivered to the courtroom
several file boxes.
<P>

23	The defendant through its counsel, as I understood Mr Wheelhouse, has
indicated a preparedness if necessary to issue a further
subpoena, but
otherwise to particularise with greater clarity the classes of documents which
it seeks, an indication which, if given,
would be given in such a way I assume
and understand to exclude a call for what the defendant acknowledges to be
clearly privileged
material.
<P>

24	Approaching the resolution of this matter in what I hope is a fair and
practical way, the course I propose to adopt is formally
to stand over the call
on the subpoena. Secondly, and it is implicit from the first course, I do not
propose to set it aside. Further,
thirdly to direct the defendant in accordance
with the intimations made by Mr Wheelhouse to provide as it were a
particularisation
of the classes of documents and things in relation to each of
(a) to (e) in the schedule which it contends should be produced as
if under
this subpoena.
<P>

25	The time within which the defendant is to do that can be a matter for
resolution shortly.
<P>

26	The only reservation I have is in relation to the person (f) in the
schedule. I understand that that person was not referred
to in the discovered
material and I will be corrected if I am wrong, has not otherwise been referred
to in particulars in support
of any of the defences.
<P>

27	To that extent I would hold that there is no apparent relevance in relation
to the person referred to as (f) but will require
the defendant to provide
particulars of the basis of relevance of that person to the issues as presently
defined between the parties,
as well as in relation to that person, particulars
of the classes of documents and things to which I have referred.
<P>

28	 In the light of the submissions made it has to be recognised, as I think I
have already said to some extent, that on the production
by a solicitor of a
file it is not to everything in that file to which privilege would attach. A
further particularisation of the
material along the lines I have suggested
should I trust eliminate, or if not eliminate, reduce any argument as to
whether any component
of that material attracts the privilege which for present
purposes I will assume to be asserted in respect to each person in the
schedule.
<P>

29	In summary, and bearing in mind that I have not formally disposed of the
application by the plaintiff made by Mr McHugh, I am
persuaded that it cannot
be said that there is "<i>no conceivable relationship"</i>. I am persuaded that
it cannot be said that the exercise is "<i>fishing"</i>.
<P>

30	I am persuaded that it cannot really be said that the issue of this subpoena
is an abuse of process by reason of the material
being sought manifestly being
privileged for the reason that the material sought cannot on any reasonable
basis attract exclusively
and in its totality the description of its being
"<i>manifestly privileged"</i>. It is for those reasons that I have stood over
the call on the subpoena and directed the defendant to further particularise
that
which it seeks thereunder.
<P>
