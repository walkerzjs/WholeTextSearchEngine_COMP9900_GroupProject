<P>

	HER HONOUR  :  
<P>

1	The plaintiff sues the defendant for defamation arising out of a publication
by the defendant in "The Daily Telegraph" a daily
newspaper circulating in
NSW.
<P>

2	The publication was a news item concerning evidence given to a hearing by the
Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC)
in April 1988 into allegations
that involved a person called Louis Bayeh, who was described in the body of the
item as an "underground
figure" It was headlined:
<P>

	"Bayeh Lawyer says he met Whelan".
<P>

3	Underneath the headline was a large photograph, to which I will return, and
underneath the photograph was a report of evidence
given to the inquiry.   In
the body of the report was a reference to evidence about a meeting attended by,
among others, a person
described as a "brothel owner". 
<P>

4	A subsidiary story was contained in a box inserted into the body of the main
story, and this was headed:
<P>

	"Louie's faithful Yvonne".
<P>

5	"Yvonne" was Yvonne Nassif, the plaintiff.   In this box the plaintiff was
described as having "maintained a diligent presence
in the public gallery", to
have arrived regularly in Bayeh's Mercedes and developed friendly relationships
with his legal representatives
and others around the inquiry.
<P>

6	The photograph is a significant part of the publication, and is central to
the plaintiff's claims.   It is captioned:
<P>

	"Louis Beyeh's girlfriend Yvonne outside the commission hearing yesterday."
<P>

7	The plaintiff is depicted on the far right of the photograph, dressed in a
full length coat, carrying a handbag, and holding something
which may be and,
for the purposes of the argument, was assumed to be, a mobile phone to her
right ear.   The remainder of the photograph
is taken up with what appears to
be a large garage roller door which is closed, and on which is painted or
printed in large block
letters the words "ANY TIME".
<P>

8	The plaintiff claims that the publication taken as a whole conveys five
imputations, each of which is defamatory of her.   They
are:
<P>

	"(a)	The Plaintiff is a Prostitute.
<P>

	(b)	The Plaintiff solicits clients for the purpose of prostitution by mobile
telephone.
<P>

	(c)	The Plaintiff is available for prostitution any time.
<P>

	(d)	The Plaintiff is a person of loose morals.
<P>

	(e)	the Plaintiff is the sort of person who would pose provocatively in front
of a sign reading "Any Time."
<P>

9	The defendant has objected to the imputations. 
<P>

10	The principal argument was that the matter complained of is incapable of
conveying any of the imputations pleaded except imputation
(d).
<P>

11	Counsel for the plaintiff sought to support the imputations pleaded.   He
pointed to the reference to the "brothel owner" in
the body of the news report;
 to the references to the plaintiff by name in the boxed inset;  to the manner
in which the plaintiff
is depicted, standing in front of the garage door; to
the words "Any Time" painted on the garage door;  to the description of Bayeh
as an "underworld figure"; and to the identification of the plaintiff as
Bayeh's "girlfriend".  When all of these were combined,
counsel argued, the
imputations pleaded were available.
<P>

12	One essential element of each of imputations (a), (b) and (c) is the
attribution of prostitution to the  plaintiff.  I am unable
to see that the
publication as a whole, or any individual part of it, is capable of conveying
any such imputation.   In this regard
counsel relied heavily upon the
juxtaposition of the words "Any Time" with the depiction of the plaintiff.   I
am satisfied that,
even without regard to the caption, but particularly if the
caption is taken into account, those words could not be taken to bear
any
relationship to the plaintiff.   It is nowhere suggested that the garage door
is at the plaintiff's premises, or has anything
to do with her other than
providing a backdrop for her use of the mobile phone (if that is what it is)
outside the hearing.   The
mere mention of a brothel owner in another context
in the news report, and the assertion that the plaintiff's fiance is "an
underworld
figure" do not create a connection or strengthen an existing
connection between those words and the plaintiff.   I am of the view
that there
is nothing in the matter complained of that identifies the plaintiff as a
prostitute.   Imputations (a), (b) and (c) will
be struck out.
<P>

13	In any event, I am satisfied that the defendant's secondary argument, that
imputations (b) and (c) do not differ in substance
from imputation (a), should
be accepted.   Counsel for the plaintiff argued that imputations (b) and (c)
conveyed a notion of immorality
more serious and greater in degree than the
imputation that the plaintiff is a prostitute.   However, he was unable to
pinpoint the
escalation in seriousness other than by suggesting that the use of
the mobile telephone for prostitution purposes, or ready availability
at "any
time" for the purposes of prostitution somehow suggests that she is more
indiscriminate in the selection of her clientele
than some other prostitutes
and therefore morally more blameworthy.  I do not accept that the use of a
mobile telephone for the purposes
of prostitution in any way denotes less
discriminating selection of clients than solicitation by some other means.
Furthermore I
do not accept that availability at "any time" is morally more
reprehensible than prostitution during limited hours.  It is true that
each of
these imputations conveys an additional alleged fact about the manner in which,
it is suggested, the plaintiff goes about
the business of prostitution, but
there is no difference in the essence of the allegations - that is, that the
plaintiff is employed
in prostitution.   I am therefore satisfied that
imputations (b) and (c) do not differ in substance, for the purposes of the law
of defamation, from imputation (a).    
<P>

14	The final argument concerned imputation (e).   That imputation is dependent
upon an inference that the plaintiff posed for the
photograph, as distinct from
having her photograph taken, whether nor not she was aware of it, by a
photographer near where she happened
to be.   In my opinion the photograph is
capable of being interpreted by an ordinary reasonable viewer as either posed
or not posed.
  The next question is whether the pose could properly be
described as "provocative".   The word is imprecise;   but a reader who
inferred that the photograph was posed, might think that the plaintiff had
deliberately joined with the photographer, in a somewhat
sardonic joke.   I
doubt whether that, alone, could really be held to defame the plaintiff, but
that is not the question.   The present
question is whether the matter
complained of is capable of conveying the imputation pleaded, and, with some
hesitation, I conclude
that it is so capable.
<P>

15	Accordingly, I strike out imputations (a), (b) and (c).
