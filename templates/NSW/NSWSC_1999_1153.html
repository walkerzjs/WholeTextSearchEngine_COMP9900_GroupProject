<b><u>SENTENCE</u></b>
<P>

 
<P>

                           
<P>

 
<P>

1   	<b>HER HONOUR</b>:  On Monday, 18 October 1999 Soo Duck
Jang was arraigned on an indictment charging him that (i) on 8 April 1998 at
Blacktown he did
murder In Ja Yoo and (ii) on the same date at Blacktown he did
murder Min Kyoung Kang.  He entered pleas of not guilty to both counts
and a
jury was empanelled.  
<P>

2   	Prior to any evidence being taken Mr Dhanji, who appears
for the prisoner, sought a short adjournment in which to confer with
his
client.  Thereafter when the court resumed Mr Dhanji asked to have his client
re-arraigned.  That was done and the prisoner entered
pleas of guilty to both
counts in the indictment.  
<P>

3   	I accepted those pleas and, pursuant to s 399A of the<b>
<A HREF="/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/"><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a></b> 1900</A>, I discharged the jury from giving a verdict in the matter
and recorded convictions on both counts.
<P>

4   	The prisoner is aged 57.  He is a Korean national.  He was
the husband of the deceased, In Ja Yoo, who was aged 48 at the time
of her
death.  The two were married in Korea in October 1995.  The deceased, Min
Kyoung Kang, who was 27 at the time of her death,
was In Ja Yoo's daughter by a
previous marriage.
<P>

5   	In Ja Yoo was a Korean national who had been granted
permanent resident status in Australia in 1991.  The prisoner was anxious
to
become a permanent resident of Australia also.  In Ja Yoo acted as his sponsor
in an application submitted to the Minister for
Immigration.  Subsequently she
withdrew her sponsorship and refused to sign further forms necessary as part of
the progress of the
prisoner's application.
<P>

6   	In the months preceding the killings the prisoner made
repeated demands to In Ja Yoo that she sign the immigration papers.
 He
threatened to kill her and her family should she not do so.
<P>

7   	On 18 March 1998 In Ja Yoo called to see her neighbour, Ha
Yu Kim.  She was holding her stomach with her hands and was unable
to speak for
about three minutes.  She appeared to be in pain and was crying.  She told Ha
Yu Kim that she had had an argument with
the prisoner who had punched her in
the stomach and said to her, "If you don't sign and cooperate with me I will
kill all of your
kids".  Not long after this incident In Ja Yoo took an
overdose of Valium and was admitted to Concord Hospital where she remained
until 7 April 1998.  While she was in hospital the deceased, In Ja Yoo, told
her daughter, Sun Kyoung Kang, that the prisoner had
been calling to the
hospital almost every day, harassing her  and making threats concerning the
permanent residency papers.  The
deceased reported to her daughter that the
prisoner had said if she wasn't to sign the papers he was going to kill
everyone.
<P>

8   	On her discharge from hospital the deceased went to live
with her son, Dae Sung Kang, at his unit number 110/130 Reservoir
Road,
Blacktown.
<P>

9   	On the evening of 7 April 1998 police served upon the
prisoner an application for an apprehended violence order which had been
taken
out on behalf of In Ja Yoo and was returnable before the Burwood Local Court on
9 April 1998. That same evening the prisoner
took a letter addressed to Dae
Sung Kang to the Reservoir Road premises.  In that letter he asserted that
unless In Ja Yoo resolved
the immigration matter he would write to the relevant
authorities disclosing matters adverse to In Ja Yoo with a view to having her
expelled from Australia.
<P>

10   	On the morning of 8 April 1998 Sung Hee Jun, a friend of
the deceased, Min Kyoung Kang, was present at the Reservoir Road
premises when
In Ja Yoo spoke with the prisoner by telephone.  Ms Jun heard the deceased say,
"I don't want to see you.  Don't come
around.  Do whatever you want.  Go and
report to the Immigration".
<P>

11   	At about 11.30 am on that morning the prisoner called to
the Reservoir Road premises.  At the time In Ja Yoo was taking a
nap in an
upstairs bedroom with her grandchild.  The only other persons present in the
home were the deceased, Min Kyoung Kang, and
her friend, Sung Hee Jun.  It
appears that the prisoner went upstairs where he was heard to be talking with
In Ja Yoo.  After a little
time the two came down to the lounge area.  Min
Kyoung Kang and Sung Hee Jun were also in this vicinity.  Sung Hee Jun heard
the
prisoner quarrelling with In Ja Yoo over the matter of the immigration
papers.  During this quarrel the prisoner produced a knife.
Min Kyoung Kang
screamed.  Sung Hee Jun saw that the prisoner had his hands around In Ja Yoo's
neck.  Min Kyoung Kang came to her
mother's assistance taking hold of the
prisoner's arm.  The prisoner pushed her away causing her to fall to the floor.
He was seen
to make a cutting motion across the neck of In Ja Yoo.  He stabbed
her twice to the neck, three times in the region of the chest
and three times
in the region of the abdomen.  She also sustained a wound to her back.  Min
Kyoung Kang stood up and again took hold
of the prisoner's right arm.  The
eyewitness, Sung Hee Jun, described events in this way:
<P>

"He did another cutting motion across In Ja's neck while Min Kyoung was holding
on to his right arm.  He cut her neck a total of
three times and it was in a
slow motion."
<P>

I pause to observe that the autopsy report suggests in fact two severe wounds
to the neck.
<P>

"In Ja was moaning.  I saw blood coming from her neck. I then walked towards
him and he lunged towards me two times with the knife.
 I could not get near
him.  I walked backwards and away from him.  With Min Kyoung still holding onto
Soo Duck's right arm, Soo Duck
stabbed In Ja four times  in the stomach and
upper chest area.  Soo Duck then took hold of both Min Kyoung and In Ja with
his left
hand.  He had hold of both their shirt collars with his hand.  Soo
Duck was still holding the knife in his right hand.  They were
both sitting on
the floor.  Min Kyoung was struggling and screaming.  I was panicking and
pacing around the room.  I was screaming.
 I was scared and did not know what
to do. Soo Duck spoke to Min Kyoung in a calm voice.  He said to her, "You too
are a bad kid".
 As he said these words he cut Min Kyoung's throat in a slow,
slicing motion.  Whilst he cut her on the neck he had hold of her shirt
collar
with his left hand.  I saw blood coming from Min Kyoung's neck.  In Ja was
sitting on the floor next to Min Kyoung.  After
cutting Min Kyoung he mumbled
something to himself.  He then stabbed In Ja in the chest area with the knife
in his right hand.  I
saw him stab Min Kyoung also in the chest area."
<P>

12   	Sung Hee Jun's account suggests that the prisoner moved
from the mother to the daughter inflicting injuries in turn during
the
attack.
<P>

13   	She noted that the prisoner spoke to her calmly when he
said, "Don't use the phone".  When she attempted to move towards the
front door
the prisoner blocked her path pointing the knife in her direction.
<P>

14   	The prisoner forced Sung Hee Jun into the laundry closing
the door behind her.  She was able to escape and was later found
hiding by a
neighbour.
<P>

15   	Fiona Kaye Marsden and Jackie Annetta Savage were both
residents of the units at 130 Reservoir Road, Blacktown and both heard
screaming from unit 110 that morning.  From the sliding door in her lounge room
Ms Marsden saw a lady in a white shirt with black
hair screaming and moving
away from a man who was holding a knife.  She saw the man bending down,
crouching over something, moving
his hands in a stabbing motion.  She
immediately ran to the telephone and dialled 000.  After doing so she decided
to go and help
the people in unit 110.  As she approached the front door she
saw a man leaving on a racing bike.  This was the prisoner.  She observed
that
he seemed really calm.  He appeared to have come out of the garage of unit 110.
It was not clear to her that this was the same
man as the one she had seen
apparently stabbing someone inside the unit.  Nonetheless, she walked up the
front path and knocked on
the front screen door.  Her courage in this regard
was of a high order.  She heard the baby screaming inside the unit and saw two
people lying on the floor surrounded by blood.  She did not know what to do.
She saw the garage door was open and she considered
that there may be someone
still inside.  She met up with her neighbour, Jackie Savage.  The two of them
went back to the front door
of the unit and tried to open it.  The door was
locked.  Fiona Marsden went back to her flat to make a further call for
assistance
from the authorities and to obtain a knife so that the two of them
could cut through the screen door.  Whilst she was absent, Jackie
Savage
succeeded in breaking in to the unit and reassuring the occupants that the
police were on their way.  Ms Savage checked the
rooms in the downstairs
portion of the unit to find out if anyone was still there.  She comforted the
distressed baby and collected
 towels from the bathroom and attempted to
staunch the bleeding of the two women on the floor while she and Ms Marsden
awaited the
arrival of the police and the ambulance service.  The bravery and
concern for their neighbours shown by both women was notable and
is deserving
of recognition.
<P>

16   	The prisoner left the scene on his bicycle.  He rode to a
Telecom transmission station where he entered a deserted building.
 He made an
attempt at suicide by cutting his wrists with a broken bottle.  When this did
not prove successful he was to tell police
that God did not want him to die.
Rather he should give himself up to the authorities and tell the Korean
community what sort of
person In Ja Yoo was.  He went to St Mary's Police
Station and surrendered himself.  He was fully co-operative with police in the
subsequent investigation.  He participated in an electronically recorded
interview in which he made admissions and he participated
in a video recorded
walk-through at the scene.
<P>

17   	In the course of the interview the prisoner described his
thought process as he went to the St Mary's Police Station:
<P>

 "Then on the way I was walking.  I thought the, I should let the whole
situation to the Korean society know about the matter. 
I wanted to let the
whole, our community that the, I wanted to give them warning that the, these
women who got married for the, the
residency matters, permanent residency
matters and those who, those women who acting, behaving like that, I wanted to
give them warning,
they, having them see the, have them, having them see the
whole picture, what the, what happened today, that what I wanted to know,
and
I, I wanted to do to the, to the whole community people."
<P>

18   	It is clear that at the time and subsequently the prisoner
entertained a view that the deceased, In Ja Yoo, had brought matters
upon
herself by her obstinate refusal to do as he wished in the matter of the
immigration application. His reasons for killing Min
Kyoung Kang are a little
less clear.  In his interview he said that Min Kyoung was holding onto him and
that was the reason that
he stabbed her.
<P>

19   	The prisoner maintained in his interview with police that
his initial intention had not been to kill the two women.  I do
not accept
that.  The account given by the eyewitness together with the post mortem
photographs speak eloquently of the prisoner's
intention.  Mr Dhanji did not
seek to contend otherwise.  I approach this matter upon the basis that the
prisoner's intention in
respect of both his victims was to kill them.
<P>

20   	I do not consider that the evidence establishes beyond
reasonable doubt that the prisoner planned to kill In Ja Yoo, or any
other
person, prior to his arrival at the unit that morning.  I approach this matter
upon the basis that the prisoner had made threats
to the deceased, In Ja Yoo,
in connection with the progress of his immigration application. On the morning
of the killing I consider
that he arrived at the premises with no fixed
intention to carry out any such threat but that when In Ja Yoo refused to
comply with
his  demands he killed her, as he had told her he would, with
deliberation.  The last moments for both mother and daughter were terrifying.
The prisoner left the two bleeding on the floor of the unit and calling out for
help.  He was asked why he had not offered them any
assistance and he
explained, "They bled too much and I was too scared".
<P>

21   	Objectively these two killings display a high level of
criminality.  There is little in the way of mitigation.
<P>

22   	Mr Dhanji invited me to find that in his interview with
the police the prisoner had expressed some regret for his conduct.
 This, it
seems to me, is to take isolated passages from the interview entirely out of
context.  In answer to one question, toward
the end of the interview, the
prisoner said,  "I'm very sorry about those two people who died".  It is to be
noted that he went on
to state:
<P>

 "What I wish is those vicious women who squeeze this money out from men who
hasn't got permanent residency and then they report
those people to Immigration
Department and kicking out of this country.  I wish those people wouldn't do
that sort of things any
more."
<P>

The answer continues in that vein.
<P>

23   	A report prepared by Dr Christopher Canaris was tendered
on the prisoner's behalf.  Dr Canaris saw the prisoner at the MRRC,
Silverwater, on 28 September 1998.  On that occasion the prisoner gave an
account that he had been feeling completely normal on the
day of the killings.
He had no intention of killing the women until he became involved in an
altercation with In Ja Yoo.  Dr Canaris
asked him how he had come to kill his
wife and he said that he had placed the knife against her neck.  She had
displayed no fear
and very calmly called upon her daughter to call the police.
Her daughter came to the phone and started to press the buttons. The
prisoner
apparently told Dr Canaris that had Min Kyoung Kang intervened in some other
way the killing would not have occurred.  For
example, if she had said words of
comfort or something conciliatory he would have listened.  When the daughter
grabbed him by the
arm his wife started to yell for help.  As she and the
daughter were yelling something was said to have gone through his brain. 
This
was to the effect that the two women, "Should have gone forever from the Korean
community".  The prisoner also told Dr Canaris
that he believed he had
sacrificed himself in order to get rid of the evil in the Korean community.  Dr
Canaris observed that it
appeared that the prisoner saw it as his task to get
rid of these people although not in the sense of a special mission imposed by
God.
<P>

24   	Dr Canaris went on to report that the prisoner did not
feel depressed or sad at any stage.  He had experienced no problem
sleeping nor
any change to his appetite or weight. There was no evidence of bizarre
delusions or hallucinations.  He reported no
family history of psychiatric
problems.
<P>

25   	I approach this matter upon the basis that the prisoner is
not remorseful and does not appreciate the enormity of his crimes.
<P>

26   	From the history given to Dr Canaris it appears that the
prisoner comes from Pusan.  He was married prior to his marriage
to In Ja Yoo.
He has a son and a daughter by the first marriage but maintains no contact with
them.  He explained to Dr Canaris,
"I finished with them after the divorce".
He is the eldest of four siblings but has had no recent contact with them.  He
reported
a normal childhood having grown up in a family with loving parents.
He came to Australia in 1987 and supported himself variously
as a cleaner and
as a badminton coach.
<P>

27   	The prisoner has no prior convictions.  During his time in
custody he has been befriended by a number of members of the community
who have
provided references for him.  They attest to the circumstance that the prisoner
has shown an interest in Christian religious
teaching and that he has also been
active in the production of sculpture and other art works within the prison.
<P>

28   	I have been assisted in this matter by helpful submissions
prepared by both the Crown Prosecutor and Mr Dhanji together with
extensive
reference to recent cases in which this Court, both at first instance and on
appeal, has considered the sentencing of persons
convicted of murder.
<P>

29   	The maximum sentence for the crime of murder is penal
servitude for life.  A person sentenced to penal servitude for life
is required
to serve that term for the term of his natural life; <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s19a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 19A(2)</a> of the<b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes
<A HREF="/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/">Act</a></b> 1900</A>.
<P>

30   	Section 431B(1) of the<b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a></b> provides:
<P>

"A court is to impose a sentence of penal servitude for life on a person who is
convicted of murder, if the court is satisfied that
the level of culpability in
the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in
retribution, punishment, community
protection and deterrence can only be met
through the imposition of that sentence."
<P>

31   	This provision was inserted into the<b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a></b> by
the<b> Crimes Amendment (Mandatory Life Sentences) Act</b> 1996.  Section
431B(3) provides that nothing in subsection (1) effects s 442 of the Act.
Relevantly, that subsection provides that
where by any section of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes
Act</a> an offender is made liable to penal servitude for life the judge may
nevertheless pass a sentence of penal servitude of less duration.
<P>

32   	The criteria to which the sentencing judge must have
regard pursuant to s 431B(1) appear to reflect the observations of the
Court
in<b> Regina v Garforth</b> (unreported, NSW CCA, 23 May 1994).  Prior to the
introduction of the mandatory life sentence upon satisfaction of the criteria
set
out in s 431B(1) the basis upon which a life sentence was called for was
expressed in<b> Regina v Twala</b> (unreported, NSW CCA, 4 November 1994) in
the judgment of Badgery-Parker J:
<P>

"It must be possible to point to particular features which are of very great
heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the
absence of facts
mitigating the seriousness of the crime (as distinct from subjective features
mitigating the penalty to be imposed)."
<P>

33   	In that case the court considered that the violent and
horrible killing of the victim by (multiple stabbing),  influenced
as it was by
the mental disturbance of the prisoner resulting from the breakdown of his
relationship with the victim upon whom he
was obsessively dependent, could not
be characterised as falling within the worst category. It is to be noted that
in that case the
sentencing judge found that the prisoner had formed a
precisely formulated prior intention to inflict severe and painful bodily harm
on his victim well before the fatal attack.
<P>

34   	In the present case I do not find that the prisoner
planned either killing, or that he planned to inflict physical violence
falling
short of killing, on either of his victims.  It appears that he was indifferent
to the fate of both.  When he felt he was
being thwarted by his wife, he had no
compunction about killing her or her daughter.  As I have already noted the
objective gravity
of the offences is high and is compounded by the fact both
that he took two lives and that at the time of so doing he intended to
kill.
Nonetheless, I am not satisfied that the level of culpability is so extreme as
to require the imposition of a life sentence
pursuant to s 431B(1).  It flows
from this that I am of the view that I should impose determinate sentences in
this case.
<P>

35   	On the prisoner's behalf it is submitted that I would have
regard to the prisoner's sense of betrayal arising out of In Ja
Yoo's refusal
to sign the immigration papers. Further, it is submitted that I would place
weight on those matters in the record of
interview suggestive that the prisoner
experienced a loss of control at the time of the killings.  Generally, it is
contended that
the feelings of betrayal, the loss of his relationship and the
loss of the goal of permanent residency in combination sparked what
is
described as a loss of control.  I accept that the prisoner felt betrayed by
his deceased wife.  I do not consider there was any
foundation to give rise to
this sense of betrayal. Rather, it seems to have flowed from the prisoner's
rigid and unreasoning view
of his wife's obligations to him.  The submission
concerning the loss of control does not sit well with the account of the
eyewitness.
 I do not accept it.  I find nothing in these matters put on the
prisoner's behalf to mitigate his crimes.
<P>

36   	I take into account the prisoner's pleas of guilty.  I
note that they were entered at the very last and in the face of an
overwhelming
Crown case.  However, he is entitled to some benefit for the pleas nonetheless.
In referring to the strength of the
Crown case I take into account that the
prisoner surrendered himself to the police and admitted the offences. Of more
significance
in weighing up such matters in mitigation as might be identified
is the circumstance that the prisoner committed the offences at
the age of 56,
having led an apparently law abiding life up to that time.  He is now 57 and
necessarily faces a very lengthy period
in custody.
<P>

37   	My attention was drawn to the observations of Allen J in
<b>Regina v Holyoak</b> (NSW CCA 1 September 1995).  In that case in the
context of dealing with an appeal brought on behalf of a prisoner then of
advanced
years, his Honour said that account must be taken of the circumstance
that imprisonment for such a person falls more heavily than
on a younger
offender.  In part this flows from a realisation that, having regard to the
offender's age, he or she may not live to
the date of release.  The appellant
in<b> Holyoak</b> was aged 75 years.  The prisoner is a man in his middle
years.  It is true that he will be of advanced years before he is eligible
for
release into the community and an old man before his sentence is complete.  So
much is inevitable given the nature of his crimes.
<P>

38   	It was submitted that I would find there were special
circumstances within the meaning of s 5(2) of the<b> <A HREF="/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sa1989121/"><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></b> 1989</A>
having regard to the prisoner's age and the circumstance that this is his first
gaol sentence.  If a court determines that "special
circumstances" exist
consideration is given as to whether the existence of those circumstances
justifies an additional term in excess
of the one-third minimum term;  <b>R v
Hampton</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2044%20NSWLR%20729" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 44 NSWLR 729</a> per Spigelman CJ at 732.  I do not consider
there is a need for an additional term in excess of one-third of the minimum in
this
case.
<P>

39   	Soo Duck Jang, in respect of each conviction I sentence
you to a minimum term of 18 years penal servitude.  In each case the
sentence
is to commence on 8 April 1998 and will expire on 7 April 2016.  I specify an
additional term of 6 years which in each case
will commence on 8 April 2016 and
expire on 7 April 2022.
<P>
