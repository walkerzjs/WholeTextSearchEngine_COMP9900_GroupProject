<P>


<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR: An order was made by Newman J of this Court on
12 December 1996 pursuant to the powers residing in this Court under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s10</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Assets Recovery Act</i> 1990</a> (the Act).  In accordance with usual
practice those orders were made ex parte in reliance upon an affidavit of
Michael Charles Luland
sworn 12 December 1996.
<P>

2   	The essence of the case put to his Honour on behalf of the
New South Wales Crime Commission (the Commission) was that on the
search of
property occupied by the present applicant money and drugs were found.  Orders
were sought and obtained relating to a number
of items of property, funds in
various bank accounts and $40,000 in cash.  None of the property was shown to
have been owned, in
any sense, by Sharyn Allana Gardiner from whose criminal
activities alone Mr Luland suspected they were derived.
<P>

3   	As I understand it, the reasonable suspicion necessary to
the exercise of the Court's discretion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s10</a> of the Act was engendered by
the relationship of Sharyn Allana Gardiner to the applicant, namely, she was
his ex-wife, and to James
Keith Gardiner in particular, their son, added to her
conviction in respect of the possession and cultivation of a large quantity
of
Cannabis plants.
<P>

4   	Although this evidence was exiguous it seems to me, with
unfeigned respect for his Honour, that it was sufficient to engender
the
reasonable suspicion to which <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s10(3)(b)</a> of the Act refers.  Indeed Mr Steirn SC
for the applicant did not seek to maintain the contrary.
<P>

5   	This application is brought to permit the applicant to show
by other evidence, including his own and that of an accountant,
that no
reasonable suspicion could presently exist that the property is relevantly
derived.
<P>

6   	Without conceding that the applicant is in a position to
call such evidence Mr Temby QC for the Commission submits that even
were such
evidence available this Court either could not or should not permit the
question to be litigated.  He submits, and rightly,
that even if the order made
by Newman J was in error this could be corrected only by appeal.  He submits
that the power to make ancillary
orders or vary a restraining order conferred
on the Court by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s12</a> of the Act cannot permit an enquiry of the fundamental kind
sought by the applicant directed to undermining the continuance of the
restraining order and hence cutting short the appropriate succession of
hearings involving an application for a forfeiture order
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s10</a>, the making
of a forfeiture order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s22</a> and the consideration of any application under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s25</a> of the Act.
<P>

7   	The significance of this point is of some real substance.
Having regard to the questions posed for consideration by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss22</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">25</a> of the
Act and the differing onus which those provisions place upon the parties, the
scheme of the Act appears to be that if there
is a reasonable suspicion of
criminal derivation of assets, a restraining order may be made ex parte which
will subsist for more
than 48 hours, providing, amongst other things, an
application for a forfeiture order is made.  That application is determined by
the considerations in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s22</a> of the Act which contains two significant elements.
The first is that the onus of proof of the relevant crime-related activity is
on the Commission, though the standard of proof is the civil standard, namely,
a matter of probability;  the second is that this
enquiry does not concern
itself with any link between the crime-related activity and the property in
question but, rather, with the
existence of a specified criminal history.
<P>

8   	A person who wishes to obtain relief from an asset
forfeiture order must (for relevant purposes) proceed under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s25.</a>  That
provision enables such a person to establish that the property was not
illegally acquired.  If the person succeeds in establishing
this more probably
than not then, in substance, it must be returned to the person. 
<P>

9   	The philosophy underlying the Act appears to be that if it
is established, first of all, that there is a reasonable suspicion
that
property is derived from crime-related activity and that some crime-related
activity - not necessarily that to which the suspicion
attaches - occurred
within six years of the application under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s22</a>, it is reasonable and appropriate
that the property should be forfeited unless the person with an interest can
show more probably
than not it was innocently acquired.
<P>

10   	It will be seen, therefore, that a reasonable suspicion
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s10(3)</a> of the Act is not only an essential legal requirement to the
continuation of proceedings but also provides a basis in justice for
requiring
a person to establish innocent acquisition of property which is their own and
which the Act seeks to expropriate.  I refer
to the justice of the scheme, not
because the Act requires consideration of any such requirement as such, but
because in the exercise
of any available judicial discretion the justice of the
order sought, or sought to be amended in the light of subsequent circumstances,
is in a shorthand way material to a consideration of its due exercise.
<P>

11   	It is not sought to be controverted and could not be
controverted that an order which restrains the property of any person
is a most
serious interference with their civil rights.  To go to the next step of
expropriating that property is <i>a fortiori</i> so.  Accordingly, one should
not approach the exercise of the jurisdiction given to this Court under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s10</a> of
the Act on the basis that the order is of trivial significance, to be looked at
only as a trigger for setting the procedure of
the Act in motion. 
<P>

12   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 10(2)</a> of the Act permits the Commission to apply
to this Court ex parte for a restraining order in specified circumstances.  It
is conceded
by Mr Temby QC for the Commission, if I might say so properly, that
the Commission is not required so to proceed and that in an appropriate
case
the person affected by any restraining order might well be given notice of the
application and be present and participate in
the hearing at which the order is
sought.  Indeed, as is accepted, the Act itself envisages the possibility that
a person interested
in property sought to be restrained might be notified of
the application before the order is made:  see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s11</a> (2)(b).
<P>

13   	It was weakly suggested by Mr Steirn SC for the applicant
that the Commission in this case should have given notice of its
application to
the present applicant but this submission did not long survive examination.  In
order to protect the assets sought
to be restrained it is clear that proceeding
ex parte was appropriate.  Mr Steirn SC submits that by analogy with similar
proceedings
arising otherwise in the Court an ex parte order should be interim
or temporary only and that a person affected by a restraining
order should be
able to be heard on its continuation in respect of the issues raised by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s10(3)</a>
in particular.
<P>

14   	A difficulty facing this submission is that there appears
not to be, in terms, any jurisdiction for that to occur if the Judge
when first
making the order did not so qualify it.  Mr Steirn SC concedes that he cannot
argue that the order made by Newman J erred
in failing so to do.  Rather he
says there is a prima facie basis upon which those orders are now seen to be
inappropriate in an
unqualified form and should be varied, pointing to the
provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s12(1)</a> of the Act as a source of power to do so.  
<P>

15   	Mr Temby QC, for the Commission, rightly points out that
if the restraining order be not continued then the application for
a forfeiture
order upon which it depends must fall since it is a necessary condition of such
an application that a restraining order
be in existence.  I do not find this
argument persuasive since it would only be in the event that there was no
relevant reasonable
suspicion that the restraining order would not be continued
and if there were no reasonable suspicion the basis for the proceedings
under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s22</a> of the Act would be rightly removed.
<P>

16   	The more substantial argument is that the scheme of the
Act envisages that once the initial obstacle is past and an order
obtained so
that the reasonable suspicion as to the derivation of the property is
established, though only ex parte the resolution
of any outstanding questions
must be left, as the Act, it is argued, clearly envisages, to the procedures
provided in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s22</a> and (relevantly) s<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">25</a>.
<P>

17   	Where the relevant criminal activity is that of the person
whose interest is sought to be expropriated this argument is fairly
strong.
However, where the person who is the owner of the property must answer for the
actions of another which is the effect in
this case of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s25</a> it is, to my mind,
somewhat weakened.  Of course, the specific provisions of the Act must override
any such misgivings which, in
the end, are based upon policy considerations,
admittedly both longstanding and very important but which the Legislature has
undoubted
power to qualify, especially so where it is grappling with an
extremely dangerous attack upon the integrity of the civil community.
<P>

18   	The judicial approach to this legislation has been set out
both eloquently and accurately, if I may say so with respect, in
<i>DPP v Logan
Park Investments Pty</i> <i>Limited &amp; Anor</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2037%20NSWLR%20118" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 37 NSWLR 118</a> by Kirby
P (as he then was) at 125, the correctness of which is not in question in this
case, and which was heeded by Studdert J
in <i>New South Wales Crime Commission
v Davies</i> (unreported)  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/354.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 354</a>, a case in which the Act in question
before me required consideration.
<P>

19   	If Mr Steirn's application is to succeed it can only do so
if <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cara1990272/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s12(1)</a> of the Act permits it.  That subsection relevantly is as follows -
<P>

"12(1)		The Supreme Court may, when it makes a restraining order or at any
later time, make any ancillary orders (whether or not
affecting a person whose
interests in property are subject to the restraining order) that the Court
considers appropriate and, without
limiting the generality of this, the Court
may make any one or more of the following orders:
<P>

 
<P>

(a)	an order varying the interests in property to which the restraining order
relates,
<P>

 
<P>

(b)	an order for the examination on oath of:
<P>

 
<P>

(i)	the owner of an interest in property that is subject to the restraining
order,  or
<P>

 
<P>

(ii)	another person,
<P>

 
<P>

before the Court, or before an officer of the Court prescribed by rules of
court, concerning the affairs of the owner, including
the nature and location
of any property in which the owner has an interest.
<P>

 
<P>

(b1)	an order for the examination on oath of a person who is the spouse or a de
facto partner (as defined in the <i>De Facto Relationships Act</i> 1984) of the
owner of an interest in property that is subject to the restraining order,
before the Court or before an officer of
the Court prescribed by the rules of
court, concerning the affairs of the person, including the nature and location
of any property
in which the person or that owner has an interest,
<P>

 
<P>

(c)	an order with respect to the carrying out of any undertaking with respect
to the payment of damages or costs given on behalf
of the State in connection
with the making of the restraining order,
<P>

 
<P>

(c1)	an order directing a person who is or was the owner of an interest in
property that is subject to the restraining  order or,
if the owner is or was a
body corporate, a director of the body corporate specified by the Court, to
furnish to the Commission or
Public Trustee, within a period specified in the
order, a statement, verified by the oath of the person making the statement,
setting
out such particulars of the property, or dealings with the property in
which the owner has or had an interest as the court thinks
proper,
<P>

 
<P>

(d)	if the restraining order requires the Public Trustee to take control of an
interest in property:
<P>

 
<P>

(i)	an order regulating the manner in which the Public Trustee may exercise
functions under the restraining order,  or
<P>

 
<P>

(ii)	an order determining any question relating to the interest, including any
question affecting the liabilities of the 	owner
of the interest or the
functions of the Public Trustee,  or
<P>

 
<P>

(iii)	(Repealed)
<P>

 
<P>

(e)	an order requiring or authorising the seizure or taking possession of
property."
<P>

20   	The order sought by the applicant is to vary the orders
made by Newman J by the addition of the words "pending a hearing as
to the
existence of a reasonable suspicion within the meaning of s10 as at the date of
such hearing" so that the commencing words
of the orders would then read: 
<P>

"Upon the Plaintiff giving the usual undertaking as to damages (the giving of
which by its solicitor being noted) pending a hearing
as to the existence of a
reasonable suspicion within the meaning of section 10 as at the date of such
hearing, the Court orders".
<P>

21   	It is submitted by Mr Temby QC that such a variation is
not an ancillary order within the meaning of s12(1).  He submits that
ancillary
means supplementary and subordinate to the principal matter, citing <i>McCleary
&amp; Ors v The Director of Public Prosecutions (Commonwealth)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20157%20ALR%20301" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 157
ALR 301</a> at 332.  In that case, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western
Australia considered a restraining order against a third party's
property made
pursuant to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/poca1987160/" class="autolink_findacts">Proceeds of Crime Act</i> 1987</a> (Cth) and in particular
s6K(c)(i) which extends the definition of an exempt proceeding to "a proceeding
by way of application for
a restraining order or an order that is ancillary to
a restraining order".  The application concerned proceedings to enforce an
undertaking
for damages and it was submitted that they were "ancillary to a
restraining order" and hence were exempt proceedings with the result
that
certain evidence was admissible. 
<P>

22   	The Court said (at 332) -
<P>

"In <i>Koala Motels Pty Limited v Chief Licensing Inspector</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%2018%20ALR%2012" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 18 ALR
12</a> at 14, Muirhead J pointed out that the word 'ancillary' has a special
meaning.' "It means less than supplementary or supplemental
to - it means
'subservient' or 'subordinate'..." According to the Macquarie Dictionary
'ancillary' means 'accessory;  auxiliary',
and 'ancillary relief' means
supplementary or incidental relief sought in addition to the main relief as in
matrimonial causes, proceedings
for maintenance, custody, settlement of
property or damages for adultery".
<P>

23   	The Court found that the proceedings were brought because
the undertaking was given in support of an application for a restraining
order
and was able to be enforced because the order expired and accordingly the
giving of the undertaking had "a close and direct
connection with the
restraining order".  Ipp J (with whom the other judges of the Court agreed)
went on to say:
<P>

"While proceedings for the enforcement of the undertaking are not supplementary
or incidental to the main relief (the latter being
the obtaining of the
restraining order), the enforcement proceedings are incidental and subordinate
to the restraining order as they
are dependent on the grant of the restraining
order and the expiry thereof."
<P>

24   	I do not consider that the "ancillary orders" to which
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/poca1987160/s12.html" class="autolink_findacts">s12(1)</a> refers mean ancillary only to the restraining order.  This is made clear
by the language concerning both the time ("at any later
time") and the
character of the order, which must be ancillary but may affect a person whose
interests are subject to restraint.
 Rather, I consider they are ancillary to
proceedings undertaken pursuant to the Act and accordingly ancillary to
proceedings under
s22 where an application for forfeiture is made and also to
proceeding under s25.  Since the continuing existence of the restraining
order
is a necessary precondition to the application for a forfeiture order under s22
of the Act, I consider that whether it should
continue is ancillary to
proceedings under s22 and, if it were necessary for me to so decide, ancillary
to the order made under s10.
<P>

25   	I must confess that during argument my mind has wavered
upon the question posed by the application but I consider that as
this matter
had been left in a state of ambiguity or at least uncertainty by the Act, s12
should be construed as giving ancillary
power to permit a hearing, where there
has been an order made ex parte under s10(2) and proper grounds are shown, in
respect of the
continuance of the restraining order, that is to say concerning
the continuance of the reasonableness of the suspicion, providing
that by so
doing the power is not so exercised, as it were, to allow an appeal from the
order made under s10(2) and, in this case,
by Newman J.
<P>

26   	The status of ex parte orders is well-known and takes
place in a context which is the subject of well-ploughed forensic fields.
Indeed, in <i>McCleary v DPP</i> the Court noted that the similarity in purpose
and terms of undertakings for damages provided for under the Commonwealth
legislation
(and of course in the case here) to those given in civil litigation
in support of an interlocutory injunction indicated that Parliament
intended
that the rules and practices applying to undertakings be followed as far as is
reasonably and practically possible in dealing
with undertakings under the Act.
To my mind such considerations apply also to the approach that should be taken
to orders made ex
parte for the restraint of private property.  Of course such
an interpretation must give way to the specific provisions of the Act
but I am
not persuaded in the end that the Act has  the effect contended for by Mr Temby
QC although there is much to be said for
such an interpretation.
<P>

27   	Accordingly, I propose to order under s12(1) that the
applicant may apply to terminate the effect of the restraining orders
made on
12 December 1998 upon grounds directed to the question whether as at the date
of such hearing there are reasonable grounds
for a suspicion that the
applicant's interest is serious crime derived property for the reasons
specified in section 10(3)(b) of
the Act.
<P>

28   	I do not think it appropriate to amend the orders made by
Newman J since the jurisdiction which I presently apprehend I am
exercising is
that specifically given by section 12 of the Act, subject to which,
necessarily, his Honour's orders were made.
<P>

29   	I direct the applicant to take out an order in accordance
with my reasons by Wednesday next, 8 December 1999.  A copy of that
order is to
be provided to the respondent by the end of next week.  Liberty to apply if
required.  I stand the matter over generally
for directions.  I reserve the
question of costs.
<P>
