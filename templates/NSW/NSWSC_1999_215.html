<b>JUDGMENT (Application by NSW Police to have set aside subpoena to produce
documents issued by plaintiff)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:   In connection with its application for leave to amend in
respect of its defence of justification the defendant on
3 March 1999 filed an
affidavit of Detective Superintendent Michael Woodhouse. The affidavit was
sworn on 2 March. On 3 March 1999
the plaintiff served upon the New South Wales
Police Service a subpoena for the production of documents, the schedule to
which subpoena
is in the following terms:
<P>

	<i>"1.	All documents recording the `initial attitude' of Detective
Superintendent Woodhouse to which he deposes in his affidavit sworn
2 March
1997 in these proceedings (`the affidavit') `that the majority of the documents
sought in the subpoena [issued on 18 January
1999 at the request of the
defendant in these proceedings] were protected from production by public
interest immunity'.</i>
<P>

<i>	2.	All documents recording the substance of anything said at the meeting
(`the meeting') on 27 January 1999 attended by Detective
Superintendent
Woodhouse, Detective Senior Constable Halcro, Howard Bell, James Howard,
Detective Superintendent Inkster and Detective
Sergeant Rudolph to which
Detective Superintendent Woodhouse deposes at paragraph 23 of the
affidavit.</i>
<P>

<i>	3.	All documents relating to the meeting.</i>
<P>

<i>	4.	All documents recording the agreement deposed to at paragraph 25 of the
affidavit.</i>
<P>

<i>	5.	All documents relating to the agreement deposed to at paragraph 25 of
the affidavit.</i>
<P>

<i>	6.	All documents recording the agreement deposed to at paragraph 26 of the
affidavit.</i>
<P>

<i>	7.	All documents relating to the agreement deposed to at paragraph 26 of
the affidavit.</i>
<P>

<i>	8.	All documents recording the agreement deposed to at paragraph 27 of the
affidavit.</i>
<P>

<i>	9.	All documents relating to the agreement deposed to at paragraph 27 of
the affidavit.</i>
<P>

<i>	10.	All documents recording the agreement deposed to at paragraph 31 of the
affidavit.</i>
<P>

<i>	11.	All documents relating to the agreement deposed to at paragraph 31 of
the affidavit.</i>
<P>

<i>	12.	Copies of all documents relating to John Marsden provided by Detective
Superintendent Woodhouse or any member of Strike Force
Cori to the Director of
Public Prosecutions or any member of his office in the period 1 January 1999 to
date.</i>
<P>

<i>	13.	All documents recording the substance of any communication relating to
John Marsden between</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	Detective Superintendent Woodhouse or any member of Strike Force Cori;
and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the Director of Public Prosecutions or any member of his office</i>
<P>

<i>	in the period 1 January 1999 to date".</i>
<P>

2	According to the written submissions provided in connection with the current
application, the width of the call on that subpoena
has been narrowed as
follows:
<P>

	<i>"(a)	Paragraphs 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 are pressed in their present
form.</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	The call on paragraphs 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 is limited to those
documents created by, or at the request or direction of
Messrs Woodhouse,
Halcro, Bell, Howard, Inkster, Rudolph, Cunningham or Panich".</i>
<P>

3	The Commissioner of Police, by Notice of Motion filed in the Court today,
seeks to have the subpoena set aside. I have had the
benefit of oral and
written submissions from Mr Singleton for the Commissioner and Mr McHugh for
the plaintiff.
<P>

4	Shortly stated it is contended for the Commissioner that the subpoena is an
abuse of process because there is no legitimate forensic
purpose for production
of the documents sought, because there are no concrete grounds for believing
that the documentation sought
will actually assist the plaintiff's case.
<P>

5	Indeed it is submitted that some of the documentation is not
"<i>conceivably</i>" relevant to the proceedings and because, in part ,the
subpoena is oppressive in the sense that it impermissibly requires the
Commissioner
to form judgments about what is caught by the subpoena, or
alternatively impermissibly requires the Commissioner to make enquiries
before
the subpoena can be answered.
<P>

6	That in summary form is the contention for the Commissioner founded upon an
analysis of varies authorities, principally <b><i>R v Saleam</i></b><i>
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2016%20NSWLR%2014" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 16 NSWLR 14</a>;<b> <i>The Principal Registrar of the Supreme Court v
Tastan</i></b><i> </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2075%20A%20Crim%20R%20498" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 75 ACR 498</a>, <b><i>The Attorney General for New
South Wales v Stewart</i></b><i> </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2034%20NSWLR%2067" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 34 NSWLR 67</a>,<b> <i>Carroll v The
Attorney General for New South Wales </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2060%20A%20Crim%20R%20162" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 60 ACR 162</a>, and<b> <i>Waind
v Hill and National Employers Mutual General Association Limited</i></b><i>
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%201%20NSWLR%20372" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 1 NSWLR 372.</a>
<P>

7	For the plaintiff, principally in reliance upon<b> <i>Waind v Hill</i>,
</b>an authority said not to have been questioned since its delivery in 1978 by
the Court of Appeal, it is submitted that at what is described
as the first
stage, namely production, a subpoena may be set aside as an abuse of process of
the Court on  the ground of irrelevance
only when the subpoena seeks documents
which have no conceivable relation to the proceedings (see<b> <i>Waind</i></b>
at 382F). No more, it is submitted, is required at the first stage to found the
legitimate forensic purpose for production of the
documents to court.
<P>

8	The areas of relevance within the context of the plaintiff's submissions are
stated as follows:  that one of the central issues
in the defendant's
application to amend concerns the circumstances in which the police came to
produce to the Court the statements
which are contained in an exhibit being
IRA1 to the affidavit of Mr Ian Angus sworn on 18 February 1999 and filed in
support of the
defendant's amendment application. Those are the statements of
most of the persons who are alleged to be complainants or victims
particularised in a document described as the Defendant's Consolidated
Particulars Of Truth which will be a focal point in the resolution
of the
defendant's application.
<P>

9	At the hearing of the defendant's amendment application the plaintiff
proposes to seek to challenge and explore the version of
events given by Mr
Woodhouse in his affidavit. I add that Mr Woodhouse's affidavit in full has not
yet been read in the defendant's
application, though part of it has been read
in another application.
<P>

10	Another area of relevance is said to be whether there is any ongoing
investigation of the plaintiff being conducted by the Police
Service. That
itself, that is the question of whether there is such an investigation, is
stated to be an important component of the
plaintiff's contentions that the
statements in the exhibit to Mr Angus' affidavit should never have been
produced by the police.
<P>

11	The areas of relevance outlined relate to factors both of substance and as
to discretion which in my view will attend the resolution
of the defendant's
application. It being presently impossible to catalogue those factors, it
easily can be anticipated that the material,
the subject of the subpoena, will
touch upon such questions as how and when the defendant came into the
possession of information
upon which it proposes to base its amended case, the
matter of "<i>when</i>" itself not being irrelevant to the position of the
plaintiff in meeting any such amended defence of justification.
<P>

12	In the course of oral and written submissions it has been indicated that the
plaintiff will submit that the police should have
taken the same approach to
the defendant's subpoena served upon the Police Service, the subpoena being
dated 18 January 1999, as
the police took in respect of the subpoena issued by
the plaintiff to the Police Service in October 1998.
<P>

13	Insofar as that may be perceived as suggesting impropriety, bias or lack of
partiality on the part of the police in dealing with
Orders issued by this
Court, I am concerned neither with whether that perception is well founded, nor
with any process of resolving
such an allegation, if it is made, or if it is to
be made.
<P>

14	I am persuaded that the areas of relevance to which I have referred found
the subpoena. I propose, following the approach advocated
for the plaintiff as
appropriate arising from<b> <i>Waind v Hill</i></b><i> </i>(compare <b><i>Hall
v</i> <i>Nationwide News</i>, </b>Levine J, unreported, 18 September 1998) to
decline to set aside the subpoena.
