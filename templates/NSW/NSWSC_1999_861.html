COMMON LAW DIVISION

MASTER MALPASS
<P>

FRIDAY 27 AUGUST 1999
<P>

<u>20018/98</u>	<u>MARIE LOUISE KNIGHT v ADVENTURE ASSOCIATES PTY LTD &amp;
ORS</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	These proceedings were commenced by Statement of Claim filed on 2
February 1998.  The plaintiff brings a claim for damages arising
out of the
suffering of personal injury.  The injury was suffered on 3 February 1996.  At
the time of the injury, she was a passenger
on a vessel known as "Kapitan
Khlebnikov" (the vessel) which was proceeding on a cruise to Antarctica.  At
the time of the injury,
the vessel was in the Tasman Sea about 500 nautical
miles south of Melbourne.
<P>

2  	The process names three defendants.  The first defendant is the
travel agent who sold the cruise package to the plaintiff. 
It was acting as
the sole and exclusive representative of the second defendant in Australia for
the creation, marketing and selling
of cruise products.  The vessel was owned
by the third defendant.  The vessel had been chartered by the third defendant
to the second
defendant.
<P>

3  	The originating process propounds causes of action founded on
breach of contract, negligence and breach of provisions of the
<u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade
Practices Act</u> 1974</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">(sections 52</a>, 52A and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s74.html" class="autolink_findacts">74</a>).
<P>

4  	The plaintiff resides in New South Wales.  The first defendant is
a corporation registered in the State.  The second defendant
is resident in the
USA.  The third defendant is resident in Vladivostock.
<P>

5  	An appearance has been entered on behalf of each of the first and
second defendants.  The court has been informed that the plaintiff
has
purported to serve process on the third defendant at Vladivostock.  The third
defendant has not filed an appearance.
<P>

6  	On 13 November 1998, the third defendant filed a Notice of
Motion.  The third defendant seeks either a setting aside of the
process or a
stay of the proceedings.
<P>

7  	The application was heard on 10 August 1999.  The applicant
relied on an affidavit sworn by Mr Wilson.  There was a tender of
a Statement
of Agreed Facts (Exhibit 1).  The plaintiff has sworn an affidavit.
<P>

8  	At this stage it is convenient to mention some facts and
circumstances.  The mention is not intended as an exhaustive recitation
of
relevant matters.
<P>

9  	In early 1995, the plaintiff became interested in the possibility
of undertaking a cruise of the Antarctic.  She approached
the first defendant.
Prior to 14 March 1995, she received documentation (copy documentation
comprises annexures A and B to the affidavit
of Mr Wilson) from the first
defendant.  The documentation comprised a brochure and a booking form.  She
completed and signed the
booking form.  It was signed on 14 March 1995.  At the
same time, she paid a deposit for the cruise.
<P>

10  	One section of the brochure was headed "How To Book".  It
provided for the payment of a deposit.  It made provision for the
payment of
the balance (it was to be paid by 2 November 1995).  It also made provision for
cancellations and refunds (it stipulated
certain cancellation penalties).
Another section of the brochure was headed "Terms And Conditions".
<P>

11  	The "Terms And Conditions" comprised material appearing under
various headings.  The material appearing under the heading "Provision
Of
Services" includes the following:-
<P>

"The services provided on the passenger's tour, including all transportation,
tours and other services relating thereto are provided
by the carriers and
other Principals subject to their own conditions of contract."
<P>

The material appearing under the heading "Responsibility" includes the
following:-
<P>

"The passenger contract in use by the transportation companies or firms shall
constitute the sole contract between the transportation
companies or firms and
the purchaser of the tour package/s."
<P>

The "Terms And Conditions" conclude with the following;-
<P>

"Law Governing Contract:  New South Wales".
<P>

12  	The second defendant issued a passenger ticket.  It was dated 12
April 1995.  There were no terms or conditions endorsed on
the ticket.
<P>

13  	In October 1995, the plaintiff received an invoice from the
first defendant for the payment of the balance for the cruise.
 On or about 2
November 1995, she paid the balance to the first defendant.
<P>

14  	About 2 or 3 weeks prior to departure, the plaintiff received
further documentation from the first defendant (it included a
document headed
"Cruise Contract:  Terms and Conditions - Important Notice to Passengers").  In
the affidavit of Mr Wilson it is
referred to as the "Cruise Contract".  A copy
of the "Cruise Contract" is annexure C to the affidavit of the second
defendant.  There
are definitions of words said to be used in this "Ticket and
Contract" (including definitions of "Ticket" and "Contract").  The document
further contained inter alia the following:-
<P>

"14. CHOICE OF LAW:  LIMITATION OF CARRIER'S LIABILITY
<P>

(a)  Applicable Law.  This Ticket and Contract and all rights liabilities and
duties of the Passenger and of the Carrier will be
construed in accordance with
English law.  The Carrier shall be entitled to the maximum protection allowed
by English law, including
all protection as to the amount of damages
recoverable.
<P>

.......
<P>

16. PLACE OF SUIT
<P>

All disputes, claims and suits and matters whatsoever arising under, in
connection with or incident to this Ticket or Contract shall
be brought and
litigated, if at all, in and before a court of proper venue located in London,
England, to the exclusion of the courts
of any other city, state or
country."
<P>

15  	The plaintiff says that she did not read the "Cruise Contract".
She signed it on 1 February 1996.  She says that she did not
give a signed copy
of it to any person upon boarding or after boarding the ship.
<P>

16  	On 2 February 1996, the cruise commenced by departure of the
vessel from Melbourne.  The injury was suffered the following
day when she
became unbalanced due to the action of the ocean on the vessel and fell.
<P>

17  	The plaintiff sustained a fractured skull and a fractured left
wrist.  She was taken by helicopter to Royal Hobart Hospital.
 Shortly
thereafter  she returned to her home in the Port Macquarie area.  Her treating
experts reside in this State.  Her witnesses
on the issue of liability reside
in the State.
<P>

18  	The case for the third defendant was presented as an application
for relief pursuant to either <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 10</a> r 6A or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p11" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 11</a> r 8 of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court
Rules</u> 1970</a>.  Rule 6A is in the following terms:-
<P>

"(1)	The Court may make an order of a kind referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p11" class="autolink_findacts">Part 11</a> rule 8 (which
relates to setting aside etc originating process) on application by a person on
whom an originating process is served
outside Australia.
<P>

(2)	Without limiting subrule (1), the Court may make an order under this rule
on the ground__
<P>

	(a)  that the service of the originating process is not authorised by these
rules ;  or 
<P>

	(b)  that this Court is an inappropriate forum for the trial of the
proceedings."
<P>

Rule 8 (1) enumerates orders that may be made by the court.
<P>

19  	Whilst the case was initially presented as an application for
relief expressed in the alternative, in reality it became an
application for a
stay founded on provisions contained in the "Cruise Contract".  Such a stay has
been traditionally granted by exercise
of the inherent jurisdiction of the
court.
<P>

20  	Submissions have been made both in writing and orally.  The
court has been referred to a number of decided cases (including
<u>Oceanic Sun
Line Special Shipping Company Inc v Fay</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/32.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 32</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=165%20CLR%20197" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">165 CLR 197</a>;  <u>Akai Pty Ltd v The
People's Insurance Co Ltd</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20141%20ALR%20374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 141 ALR 374</a>;  <u>FAI General Insurance Co
Ltd v Ocean Marine Mutual Protection and Indemnity Association Ltd &amp;
Anor</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2041%20NSWLR%20559" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 41 NSWLR 559</a> and <u>Baltic Shipping Company v Dillon</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2022%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991)
22 NSWLR 1).</a>
<P>

21  	The submissions threw up two principal questions.  The first
question was whether or not the "Cruise Contact" formed part of
the contractual
relationship between the plaintiff and the third defendant.  The second
question depended on whether or not the third
defendant received a favourable
answer to the first question.  If the "Cruise Contract" was found to be part of
that contractual
relationship the second question was whether or not the third
defendant was entitled to a stay of the proceedings.
<P>

22  	For completeness, it may be observed at the outset that there is
material to suggest that a contractual relationship may not
have existed
between the plaintiff and the third defendant (inter alia it has been said to
be the second defendant's "Cruise Contract"
and it is an agreed fact that the
vessel had been chartered to it).  There is also a question of consideration.
For the purposes
of determining this application, I put these matters aside.
The parties have proceeded on the basis that there was a contractual
relationship in existence.  I shall deal with the application on that
assumption.
<P>

23  	The third defendant seeks to distinguish the circumstances of
this case from other decided cases (such as <u>Fay</u>).
<P>

24  	Its further submissions, include the following:-
<P>

"13.  The third defendant thus submits that:
<P>

(i)	The booking form and promotional material did not form part of the contract
between the third defendant and the plaintiff. 
It was either non contractual
in nature or formed part of the contract only between the booking agent (the
first defendant) and the
plaintiff in respect of the booking services..  (See
<i>Fay's </i> Case) (Per Wilson J and Toohey J at 207).
<P>

(ii)	Notice was given to the plaintiff in the booking form that the conditions
of the contract of carriage would be contained in
a passenger contract which
constituted the sole contract between the carrier and the plaintiff.
<P>

(iii)	The October 1995 invoice formed part of the contract between the third
defendant and the plaintiff but did not contain all
of the terms and conditions
of carriage.  Those terms and conditions are contained in the cruise contract
which was received and
signed by the plaintiff in New South Wales prior to
embarking upon the cruise.
<P>

(iv)	The third defendant says that it had done all that was reasonably
necessary to bring the jurisdiction clause to the plaintiff's
notice prior to
the plaintiff embarking on the cruise.  It accepts that the reference to the
contract in the booking form was not
sufficient to bring the terms and
conditions of the cruise contract to the notice of the plaintiff but it did so
by forwarding the
contract to the plaintiff prior to plaintiff embarking on the
cruise.  The plaintiff acknowledges that she received it prior to embarking
on
the cruise and by signing it is taken to have read it.
<P>

(v)	The document headed cruise contract which was signed by the plaintiff on 2
February 1996 thus forms part of the contract between
the plaintiff and the
third defendant and the third defendant is entitled to rely on its terms."
<P>

25  	The plaintiff contends that the contract was made by the time
the balance was paid on 2 November 1995.  It is said that she
was not aware of
any foreign jurisdiction clause prior to the time of paying her fare in full.
It is said that the "Cruise Contract"
cannot be seen as a mere offer of
carriage.  The plaintiff directs attention to the fact that a decision to not
accept any terms
of carriage would place her in the position where she would
forfeit the fare paid by her (US $11,890).
<P>

26  	The responsibility for demonstrating that the "Cruise Contract"
forms part of the contractual relationship allegedly made between
the plaintiff
and the third defendant rests with the third defendant.  I am not satisfied
that this onus has been discharged.  I
shall briefly refer to some of the
matters that lead me to that view.
<P>

27  	In my view, if there is any contractual arrangement with the
third defendant, the material provided in March 1995 forms at
least part of it
(inter alia the material made provision for the payment of deposit, the balance
and for cancellation penalties).
 This material gave no warning that any
passenger contract would contain conditions relating to matters such as
governing law and
a submission to foreign jurisdiction.  Indeed, such matters
are not consistent with what appears in the March 1995 material (including
provision as to the Governing Law).
<P>

28  	I do not accept the contention that the third defendant had done
all that was reasonably necessary to bring that jurisdictional
clause to the
plaintiff's notice prior to the plaintiff embarking on the cruise (or any other
relevant time).  By the time that the
"Cruise Contract" came on the scene
(shortly before departure), the plaintiff had committed herself to the cruise.
She had become
subject to cancellation penalties.  Any contractual relationship
had already been finalised.
<P>

29  	There is material in the "Cruise Contract" which could be taken
as an indication that the intention was that it formed part
of the "Ticket" and
should have accompanied the ticked issued much earlier (in April 1995).  It
might be thought that perhaps due
to oversight it was brought belatedly to the
plaintiff's notice in company with other documentation (which provided
"Shipboard Information"
and "Antarctic Questions").
<P>

30  	Whilst the decision that has been reached is determinative of
the application, for the assistance of the parties I will make
a brief
reference to the second question that was agitated.
<P>

31  	The court has an unfettered discretionary power to grant a stay.
For present purposes the court is being asked to exercise
a power conferred by
the rules (as opposed to its inherent jurisdiction).  The discretion is
exercised having regard to the relevant
circumstances of the particular case
before the court.  Each case can be expected to turn on its own particular
facts.
<P>

32  	There was no dispute that clause 16 was of the character that is
described as an exclusive jurisdiction clause.  There has
been dispute as to
the circumstances which would warrant a refusal of a stay.
<P>

33  	The relevant law presently stands in an unsatisfactory state.
It is clear that weight is to be given to the bargain reached
between the
parties.  What is not so clear is the extent of the weight to be so given.
<P>

34  	The cases throw up a variety of relevant expressions with
varying connotations (including "the prima facie rule", "strong bias",
"in the
absence of countervailing reasons", "sufficient cause" and "substantial
grounds").
<P>

35  	It has been said that the exclusive jurisdiction cases require
justification of a different order from that required in a case
where the
plaintiff has simply chosen to sue in one forum rather than another (<u>Fay</u>
at 230-231).
<P>

36  	There is little guidance as to what considerations may suffice.
There is authority to the effect that public policy considerations
may be
material.
<P>

37  	Clearly, the court must have regard to the relevant
circumstances of the particular case before it.  I now turn to the
circumstances
of this case.
<P>

38  	There is a significant connection with New South Wales.  The
contract was made in New South Wales.  The plaintiff resides in
the State.  Her
witnesses are in the State.  The first defendant is resident in and carries on
business in the State.  It is the
sole and exclusive representative of the
second defendant in Australia for the creation, marketing and selling of the
cruise product
which had connection with the plaintiff's injury.  There is no
evidence as to the location of potential witnesses for other parties.
 There is
no evidence of any connection between England and the third defendant.  There
is evidence of a business connection with
New South Wales.
<P>

39  	This is simply not a case where the courts of this State provide
a convenient forum inter alia for the plaintiff.  Largely,
there does not seem
to be any real connection with either English law or a court of proper venue
(whatever that may mean) located
in London (it was said that the second
defendant had an office in the U.K.).  I bear in mind that there may be cases
where the intention
is to provide a neutral forum.  In this case, there is no
evidence as to the relevant intention.  There is nothing to suggest that
a
court located in London would provide an appropriate forum from the point of
view of the third defendant or any other party.
<P>

40  	Indeed, it would seem that London may be an inconvenient venue
for all parties.  Apart from any question of providing a neutral
venue, there
would not seem to be any utility in the parties being placed in a situation
where the dispute had to be litigated in
London.  Apart from the lack of
utility, all parties may be put to unnecessary expense if that situation was
imposed on them.
<P>

41  	There is a further consideration.  If the plaintiff's claim was
to be determined according to English law she would be deprived
of the
opportunity to prosecute her claim under the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a></u>.
<P>

42  	In the circumstances of this case, had it been necessary to do
so, I would have refused the third defendant's application for
a stay on
discretionary grounds.
<P>

43  	The Notice of Motion is dismissed.  The third defendant is to
pay the costs of the Notice of Motion.  The exhibits may be returned.
