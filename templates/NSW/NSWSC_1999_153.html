<P>

<u>10274/98  -  Technology Enterprises Pty Limited v Dharamdas &amp;
Anor</u>
<P>

<u>JUDGMENT</u>
<P>

1	The defendants are the registered proprietors of two properties.  One is
their home and known as 25 Warratta Place, Oatlands (the
Oatlands property).
The other is known as 36 Paul Street, Auburn (the Auburn property).  Both
properties have been mortgaged to the
plaintiff.  There are two Mortgages (each
of which confers security over both of the properties).
<P>

2	Each Mortgage is dated 12 November 1996.  Both were in fact executed by the
defendants on 6 November 1996.  One of the two Mortgages
secured the repayment
of a principal sum of an advance in the order of $311,000 together with
interest (the Oatlands Mortgage). 
The moneys advanced on this security were
applied to discharge existing Mortgages on the Oatlands property.  The other
Mortgage secured
repayment of two facilities (including a business loan of
$500,000) together with interest (the Business Mortgage).  The moneys advanced
on this security were applied to enable the purchase of certain equipment and
software from Laservision (Aust) Pty Ltd (LVA).  The
advances were both made on
12 November 1996.
<P>

3	In early 1996, the first defendant and Mahesh Babu began taking steps to set
up business activities in India (it was contemplated
that a company would be
formed in India to licence the LVA technology).  The establishment of the
business involved the acquiring
of equipment and software from LVA.  On 17 May
1996, a Memorandum of Understanding was executed.  It was replaced by the
Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU) entered into on 11 October 1996.  Initially,
it was intended to arrange finance in India.  Attempts to arrange
finance in
India proved to be unsuccessful.  Negotiations were then commenced with Mr
McCloskey (a director of the plaintiff and
of LVA) for the purpose of obtaining
financial assistance.  These negotiations resulted in the making of loan
agreements (which contain
an expression of interdependence) and the granting of
the two Mortgages.  Independent legal advice was had, inter alia, in relation
to these transactions (Certificates were given on 6 November 1996).  There was
a sale and delivery of the equipment and software
to Laser Vision India Ltd
(LVI) in India.
<P>

4	On 14 May 1996, the defendants had incorporated a company, Global Laser
Technologies Pty Ltd (GLT).  It had been intended that
GLT would be the
purchaser of the equipment and software.  It had always been intended that the
business in India would be conducted
by an Indian subsidiary.  On 1 July 1996,
the company, LVI, was incorporated in Bangalore, India.  Between 6 November and
12 November
1996 (which was the date of completion for the Mortgages), some
change in the arrangements took place which saw, inter alia, LVI
becoming the
purchaser of the equipment and software.  These arrangements were made on or
about 8 November 1996.  The arrangements
involved the execution of a letter by
the defendants on behalf of GLT ("PM15" being part of Exhibit A).  The
arrangements had the
effect of varying the MOU.  The defendants place some
stress on the circumstances relevant to the making of these arrangements. 
It
is contended that Babu played a significant role in negotiations.
<P>

5	There were problems in India.  The firstnamed defendant found himself
excluded from LVI.  There was default in respect of Mortgage
payments.
Although certain interest payments have been made under the Oatlands Mortgage,
the principal has become repayable and remains
unpaid.  An instalment of
$250,000 has been made in respect of the Business Mortgage.  The defendants
make no offer, by way of condition,
for the granting of relief.
<P>

6	The relevant circumstances pertaining to each of the defendants may be found
in the affidavit material.  They stand in somewhat
different positions.
<P>

7	The plaintiff commenced these proceedings to obtain possession of the two
properties.  Its case is as pleaded in the Amended Statement
of Claim.  The
defendants rely on an Amended Defence &amp; Cross Claim.
<P>

8	The plaintiff now seeks summary judgment in respect of the two claims for
possession.  The hearing has seen the reading of many
affidavits and the tender
of a considerable bulk of documentary material.  The plaintiff had relied on a
number of affidavits.  Each
of Mr McCloskey, Mr Kirkby (the solicitor for the
plaintiff) and Mr Babu have sworn an affidavit.  There are also two affidavits
sworn by Mr Ramshaw (these are affidavits of service).  Each defendant has
sworn an affidavit.  Each defendant has been cross-examined.
 
<P>

9	I have referred to some of the material revealed by this evidence.  This
reference is not intended to be an exhaustive statement
of the relevant
material.
<P>

10	The hearing commenced on 17 December 1998.  The taking of the evidence
occupied much of that day.  A brief outline of submissions
was made orally and
the further hearing adjourned to allow the parties to make written submissions.
The outline was supplemented
by detailed written submissions (pursuant to
directions, the second set of which were made on 5 February 1999).  For present
purposes,
it is not necessary to repeat that detail in this judgment.  The
making of these submissions was not completed until 25 February
1999.  The time
that has elapsed since the taking of the evidence has made the task of the
Court more difficult.
<P>

11	The questions in issue are whether or not the defendants have an arguable
claim for relief under either the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cra1980201/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Review Act, 1980</a></i> or the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act, 1974</a></i> in respect of, inter alia, the loan agreements
and Mortgages.  The claim for relief under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act, 1974</a></i>
is founded on alleged representations made by Babu as agent for LVA.
<P>

12	There is common ground on the matter of the approach to be taken to the
application for relief.  This covers both the areas of
the availability of
summary relief and the relevant statutory provisions.
<P>

13	The Court has a discretion to grant summary relief.  The discretion is
exercised having regard to the relevant circumstances
of the particular case
before the Court and so that justice is best served between the parties.  There
is abundant authority to the
effect that relief should only be granted in what
may be described as clear cases.  The party seeking summary relief bears the
onus
of satisfying the Court that the remedy should be granted.
<P>

14	Counsel have referred to various statutory provisions and decided cases
(including <u>Citicorp Australia Ltd v O'Brien</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%20398" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR 398</a>, <u>West
v AGC (Advances) Ltd &amp; Ors</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20610" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 610</a>, <u>Nguyen &amp; Anor v
Taylor</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2027%20NSWLR%2048" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 27 NSWLR 48</a> and <u>Beneficial Finance Corporation Ltd v
Karavas &amp; Ors</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2023%20NSWLR%20256" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 23 NSWLR 256).</a>  The relevant principles are well
established and need no further mention.
<P>

15	On behalf of the defendants, it is said that the two loans should not be
treated differently.  I do not accept that submission.
 
<P>

16	I shall first turn to the Oatlands Mortgage (together with the relevant loan
agreement).  The defendants continue to reside in
the Oatlands property.  They
continue to make payments of instalments of interest on the loan.  The proceeds
of the loan were used
to discharge existing securities on this property.
Although the defendants have had the benefit of these moneys, no offer of
repayment
or otherwise is made by the defendants.
<P>

17	After considering all of the relevant material, I am satisfied that the
defendants have no arguable claim for relief in relation
to this Mortgage and
that the plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment in respect of the claim for
possession of the secured land.
<P>

18	Submissions have been made on behalf of the defendants to the effect that
there should be an appropriation of moneys to the Oatlands
Mortgage (a sum of
$250,000 was paid by LVI to the plaintiff on 17 September 1997 and was
appropriated to the Auburn security). 
I do not accept these submissions.
<P>

19	I now turn to the Business Mortgage (together with the relevant loan
agreement).  The Court has been informed that the Auburn
property is occupied
by a relative of the defendants.  The proceeds of the loan were used, inter
alia, in the purchase of the equipment
and the software supplied by LVA.  The
equipment and software was sent to LVI in India.  Apparently, the business
failed and the
exercise was a financial disaster for the defendants.  It seems
that Babu has repaid a part of the advance.
<P>

20	There is complexity in the factual context.  There are matters of fact in
dispute (inter alia, the role played by Babu).  The
credibility of the
defendants may be of importance.  After considering all of the relevant
material, I remain in doubt as to the
entitlement to summary relief in respect
of this claim.  It seems to me that, whilst the defendants' claim for relief
may have its
weaknesses and ultimately fail at trial, justice is best served if
it be determined in the context of a full hearing.
<P>

21	Before proceeding to judgment, I will hear the parties further on questions
of relief.  It may be that Short Minutes will be
appropriate.  The defendants
are to pay the costs of that part of the plaintiff's claim founded on the
Oatlands Mortgage.  The costs
of the application in respect of the other part
of the claim are reserved.  The exhibits may be returned.
