<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b> The plaintiff by notice of motion filed 22 May 1998 seeks an
extension of time within which to commence proceedings pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s58.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 58(2)</a>,
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">60G</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">60I</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b> 1969 (as amended) (the Act).  The
plaintiff relied on his affidavit sworn 23 July 1998 and the affidavits of
Helen Mary Anne Balford
sworn 22 July 1998, Maithri Panagoda sworn 23 July
1998, 17 March 1999 and John Henry Gilbert Sheldon sworn 28 July 1998.  The
defendants
relied on the affidavits of Peter Robinson sworn 12 August 1998,
David Ian Brown sworn 9 September 1998 and 22 March 1999, Peter
Erwin Quinn
sworn 26 October 1998 and David Wells sworn 13 August 1998.  The plaintiff,
Andrew Salmon and Peter Robinson gave evidence
and were cross examined.
<P>

2	The plaintiff pleaded breaches of fiduciary duty, statutory duty and
negligence by the defendant from the time when it took steps
to have him made a
ward of the State until he reached 20 years of age.  The plaintiff requires an
extension of time to commence proceedings
in relation to the claims for
breaches of statutory duty and negligence.  However, the plaintiff has a
separate entitlement to prosecute
his claim for breach of fiduciary duty and
does not require an extension of time to commence those proceedings.  
<P>

3	In <b><u>Williams v Minister, Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1982 &amp;
Anor</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%2d95%29%2035%20NSWLR%20497" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994-95) 35 NSWLR 497</a>, the Court of Appeal considered whether s
60G and s 60I of the Act applies to a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.  The
facts in
<b><u>Williams</u></b> are that Ms Williams, a woman of Aboriginal
descent, born in 1942, was placed at birth in a home for Aboriginal children by
the Aborigines
Welfare Board.  A few years later she was moved by the Board to
a home for "white" children because she was fair-skinned.  She claimed
that it
was not until 1991 that she came to realise her borderline personality disorder
was the result of her childhood experiences.
 She therefore sought an order for
an extension of time under the Act in order to proceed against the relevant
authorities for negligence,
breach of duty and wrongful detention.  The motion
to extend the limitation period was dismissed at first instance and the
plaintiff
appealed this decision.  In <b><u>Williams</u></b> Kirby P at p 509
stated:
<P>

	<b>"But it is a mistake of law to assume that an equitable claim, based on an
equitable cause of action, not for damages but for equitable
compensation, is
to be dealt with under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></i>.  It is not.  It
raises separate and different questions.  Nor can the application of the Act
"by analogy" lead to the automatic
application of s 60G to such a claim.
Analogous application of the statute does not necessarily mean exact
application of its terms.
 The considerations that may be relevant to a defence
of laches will be different from (or not exactly the same as) the
considerations
relevant to the application of the Act."</b>
<P>

4	The trial in <b><u>Williams</u></b> recently took place and judgment is
reserved.
<P>

5	I observed the plaintiff giving evidence and during cross examination.  He
was quietly spoken.  I was unable to form an opinion
of the veracity of
plaintiff's evidence from his demeanour.  It is to be remembered that many of
the events about which the plaintiff
gave evidence occurred when he was a child
and thus seen through a child's eyes.  For the purposes of this application I
find the
following facts.  In doing so, I have taken the plaintiff's case at
its highest.  Should the matter go to trial some of these facts
will be
disputed.
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff was born on 2 August 1968 at Wilcannia of Aboriginal parents.
He is now 31 years of age.
<P>

(2)	On 5 March 1973 when the plaintiff was about 4 years of age he was
committed under ss 82 and 83 of the <b>Child Welfare Act</b> 1939 (the
<b>Act</b>) to the care of the Minister for Youth and Community Services by
order of the Children's Court at Wilcannia.  The records show that
at this time
the plaintiff's natural father, Frank Johnson was in gaol at Broken Hill and
his natural mother Rene Johnson was in
gaol in Wilcannia.  Mrs Johnson had been
charged with drunkenness and Mr Johnson with vagrancy and unseemly words.  The
plaintiff
was apparently left in the care of his 14 year old sister and living
in a tin humpy.  At times there was no food provided for him.
 He was removed
from the care and custody of his parents and family from that time until his
wardship was determined.  The plaintiff's
siblings are Patricia Fay born 7
March 1959, Delphine Joyce born 22 November 1960, Trevor Kenneth 28 July 1962,
Vicky Ann 5 September
1964, Kerry Jane born 2 August 1968 and Thomas Glen 20
November 1971.
<P>

(3)	From 5 March 1973 to January 1974 the plaintiff was placed in successive
institutions under the control of one or more of the
defendants, namely 8 March
1973 until 27 March 1973 - Bidura;  27 March 1973 until 7 September 1973 -
Corelli and 7 September 1973
until 7 January 1974 - McCredie Cottage.
<P>

(4)	On about 7 January 1974 the plaintiff was placed as a foster child with
white foster parents Mr Clement Salmon and Mrs Delorie
Salmon and their
children at Panania.  He remained with the Salmon family for 7 years and 7
months (until 26 August 1981) and this
period of fostering took place during
the plaintiff's formative years between 4 and 14 years of age.  The children of
Mr and Mrs
Salmon are Jeffrey, Julie, Kathy, Lisa and Andrew. During this time
insofar as the way in which the plaintiff was clothed, fed, provided
with
medical and hospital attention, attended sports clubs and played with friends
he was treated equally with the Salmon's natural
children.  The plaintiff was a
very good athlete.  However, while the other boys attended De La Salle College
he attended St Lukes
at Revesby.  An application was made on behalf of the
plaintiff to attend De la Salle but it was not successful.  During 1981 the
plaintiff's progress in 6th class at Revesby South primary school was poor.
<P>

<b><u>Chastisement</u></b>
<P>

(5)	Mr Salmon was away overseas most of the time with his job as an engineer.
The parenting was mostly done by Mrs Salmon.  The
plaintiff has always referred
and still refers to Mrs Salmon as his mother.  Mrs Salmon died in 1996.
Although he has always remembered
his mother disciplining him when he
considered that he did not deserve it, he still loved her as she was the only
mother that he
knew (t 17).  The plaintiff remembers in particular when the
Salmon family visited their cousins the children would get into trouble
and
they all would get flogged.  However he was flogged the hardest because he
would stand there laughing.  He recalled once when
they were playing
"Gilligan's Island" on boats and they tipped over and another time when they
blew up a shed (t 15).  They were
all punished but he received the worst
punishment.  
<P>

The plaintiff was also chastised with a strap or a piece of wood when Mr and
Mrs Salmon perceived that he had done something wrong.
 He recalled a further
incident when he did not get the shopping out of the car fast enough.  Mrs
Salmon had the groceries in her
hand and she elbowed him and side swiped him on
the face.  He also recalled an incident where Mrs Salmon flogged him with a
belt
in the backyard.  Another time after he was discharged from hospital at
Greenacre after having grommets removed from his ears he
told Mrs Salmon that
did not want to go home.  Mrs Salmon  flogged him in the backyard when he
arrived home.
<P>

(6)	The plaintiff recalled another incident which occurred probably towards the
end of his stay with Mr and Mrs Salmon.  It occurred
at the time when the
plaintiff was helping Mr Salmon with the extension on the back of the house.
The plaintiff took a "snack pack"
out of the cupboard and put it into his bag
to take to football.  When he returned home from football the empty "snack
pack" was
left in his bag.  The empty "snack pack" was found by Mr Salmon who
punched or "king hit" the plaintiff.  There was blood spurting
out everywhere.
The plaintiff said there may have been other incidents and that he may have
been hit once a week but the one he remembers
most clearly is the "king hit".
The plaintiff gave evidence that Andrew and Lisa Salmon saw the incident (t
22).  The plaintiff said
that his memory of this incident is clear but "when
you are hit a few times, it is a novelty".  But at the end, you remember the
main one, namely the "king hit".  
<P>

(7)	The plaintiff remembers that in a bad week he got belted once or twice by
Mr Salmon.  He was flogged hard and it would bring
tears to his eyes and he had
strap marks on his legs, back and head.  These marks would last for a day or so
until the swelling went
down.  When the plaintiff became a man Mr Salmon said
"I can't hit you no more, I can only advise you."
<P>

(8)	Andrew Salmon who was 4 years younger than the plaintiff shared a bedroom
with him at the Salmon household.  He gave evidence
that he could not recall
the plaintiff being "king hit" but he recalled all the siblings including the
plaintiff being physically
chastised when they were naughty.  They were given a
smack on the buttocks or hit on the legs with a strap and sent to their room.
It was Andrew Salmon's view that they all copped punishment equally.  There is
a conflict in the plaintiff's and Andrew Salmon's
evidence.
<P>

	<b><u>Racist comments</u></b>
<P>

(9)	Ms Helen Balford lived in the same street as the Salmon family between 1962
and 1981.  She had two sons Paul (born in 1962)
and Phillip (born in 1963).
The Balford and the Salmon families became friends and Mrs Balford became the
plaintiff's godmother.
 On 20 July 1977 Mrs Balford telephoned the office of
the department now known as the Department of Youth and Community Services
(DOCS) at Bankstown and made a confidential complaint.  She said that she was
deeply concerned by the way the Salmon family discriminated
against the
plaintiff.  She said that her son had complained that the foster parents called
the plaintiff "a little nigger" and said
"You are no better than those blacks
in South Africa causing all the trouble".  Mrs Balford expressed the view that
this discrimination
was having an effect on the plaintiff's personality.  She
observed that when the plaintiff first came to the house he was friendly
and
gregarious and now he was becoming withdrawn, unhappy and not performing to his
level of ability at school  (Ex A). 
<P>

	Mrs Balford considered that Mr Salmon held extremely racist views.  She was
not cross examined.  It is puzzling that the plaintiff
has not referred to
these types of verbal comments nor his reaction to them in his evidence, except
to say when he was asked "Were
there other forms of discrimination besides
chastisement?" he referred to "some psychological things".  Andrew Salmon gave
evidence
that there were no racial comments made to the plaintiff but conceded
that his father has "his principles".  A report of Joan Bell,
social worker at
Minali dated 15 October 1981 in the defendant's files refers to racism.  She
said that over the years there had
been quite some degree of covert racism on
the part of the Salmons and it was this attitude to black people which caused
the plaintiff
not to contact his own people and that the plaintiff's so called
inattention and poor scholastic achievements could have stemmed
largely from
unhappiness and insecurity.  She was critical of the lack of verification in
this regard and the "picture given was
one of a stereotypical view of black
people".  There was also later criticism by a psychologist at Minali of the
Department's failure
to follow up the complaint of Mrs Balford (see report of P
Champion dated October 1981).  
<P>

(10)	Later Ms Hall a senior social worker who came into contact with the
plaintiff when he was charged with murder had a conversation
with Mr Salmon in
1991 (see her report 29 January 1991).  Mr Salmon told her that "these people
(Aboriginals) go walk about in the
mind" and that the plaintiff "as an
Aboriginal was genetically inferior to his own children."  There is evidence to
support the view
that Mr Salmon made racist comments about the plaintiff to
him.
<P>

	<b><u>Contact with natural family</u></b>
<P>

(11)	The plaintiff agreed that by the age of 7 years he was aware that he had
another family.  In February 1975, just over a year
after placement in the
foster home, a Periodical Report on Ward noted the plaintiff talking about his
natural family and that Mrs
Salmon was prepared for him to have a meeting with
his family.  However, it appears that this was not followed up.
<P>

(12)	In June 1976 the Annual Placement Report noted that the situation remained
the same as at February 1975, as above.  This report
recommended meetings be
arranged.  One such meeting occurred when the plaintiff's sisters, Patricia,
Delphine and Kerry attended
a birthday party held for him at the Salmons' home
on 1 August 1976.  The plaintiff recalled that his sisters attended his 7th
birthday
party (it was actually his 8th birthday).  A further reported noted
that contact was maintained on several other occasions.  However,
after the
plaintiff's sister Patricia telephoned him and told him that their father had
purchased a new home and would apply for
the plaintiff to be returned home, the
foster parents had second thoughts and became dubious about the plaintiff
having any more
contact with his sisters.  
<P>

(13)	In June 1977 a report form stated that it was possible for restoration to
be made between the plaintiff to his natural family
in the foreseeable future.
In July 1977 there was a dramatic improvement in the plaintiff's natural
parents' family situation but
by August 1977 this had changed.  The department
noted marital disharmony and decided that the children should not be restored
to
the family.
<P>

(14)	By February 1978 an Annual Ward Report recorded that the plaintiff did not
remember his natural parents but noted that his
sister Patricia used to visit
him quite frequently.  Around this time the plaintiff received a letter from
his father.  The plaintiff
remembered receiving this letter and he thinks that
he probably signed letters to his natural family written by Mrs Salmon.  At the
time the department recorded that the plaintiff was happy to receive the letter
but seemed confused in view of the length of time
since there had been any
contact.  
<P>

(15)	Between October 1978 and January 1981 it appears that there was no contact
between the plaintiff and his natural family.  Reports
recommended contact with
his family and that "contact between Aboriginals, especially his family, would
probably solve some of the
problems" the plaintiff was experiencing with lack
of educational progress and motivation.  In August 1980 the plaintiff's father
made a request to visit the plaintiff and it was considered that having regular
sibling contact and meetings between the plaintiff
and his family were crucial
to enable him to settle back into his own natural family.  In January 1981 the
plaintiff's father visited
him in Sydney and they spent the day with relatives
in Redfern.
<P>

(16)	The plaintiff described being brought up by a white mother and a white
father and believed that the Salmon family was his family.
 One day the
plaintiff came home to see a black man who came up to him and said "I am your
father boy."  The father was crying. 
The plaintiff described feeling confused
as he now did not know who he was.  After that it was difficult to motivate the
plaintiff
to write letters to his natural family.
<P>

(17)	In August 1981 the placement with the foster family broke down and the
plaintiff was sent to the Minali Assessment Centre.
 The Breakdown of Placement
Report stated that the foster family parents were realistic, down to earth
people, with attitudes that
tended to be wrongly interpreted as racist and the
foster father had made it known that the plaintiff probably would be far better
off in his own natural family environment.  However the case conference report
of October 1991 recorded the plaintiff had come to
Minali as a foster placement
breakdown, having been told simply that he was there "for a holiday" and he was
quite certain that after
a couple of weeks he would return home.  After a few
weeks an officer of the DOCS persuaded Mrs Salmon to tell the plaintiff he was
not returning to their family.  The reasons proffered by the foster parents for
having the plaintiff removed from their family were
not persuasive.  According
to the report, he was enormously upset but handled it well.  While at Minali
the plaintiff made and received
telephone calls from the Salmon family and
spent a weekend with them.  He was hopeful of being restored to the family.
The plaintiff
later felt that he had been rejected by the Salmon family.
<P>

(18)	A Year 7 report of Springwood High School noted that the plaintiff had had
no natural family contact, and that he rejected
his Aboriginality.  It
suggested that he should be made more aware of his natural family and heritage
before leaving residential
care, while he had support and recommended possible
contact with Aboriginal families.  During 1983 the school reported that his
English
and Maths were poor and there was a lack of interest and co-operation.

<P>

(19)	Between about 20 October 1981 and about 19 December 1985 the plaintiff was
placed in another institution, Weroona in the Blue
Mountains.  It was the
plaintiff's evidence that members of the Salmon family visited him once at
Weroona.   Andrew Salmon (the youngest
child of Mr and Mrs Salmon) gave
evidence that he and members of his family visited the plaintiff several times
while the plaintiff
was at Minali and Weroona.  In December 1982 the
plaintiff's father told the department he would like the plaintiff to be
returned
to his care.  However the district officer recommended that there
should be no holiday placement in Wilcannia at that time.  
<P>

(20)	In April 1983 letters were sent to the plaintiff from Delphine and Kerry
plus one from an aunt.  The district officer also
discussed with the youth
worker at Weroona the possibility of a visit to Weroona by the plaintiff's
youngest brother, Glen and a
possible visit by him to Wilcannia in the
following school holidays.  In May 1983 photographs of the Johnson family were
sent to
the plaintiff.
<P>

(21)	Between April and December 1983 Helen Soo a social worker  had many
discussions with the plaintiff about his natural family.
 Tom Hill an
Aboriginal worker, visited Weroona on several occasions and was able to inform
the plaintiff of his family.  It was
obvious that the plaintiff was very
confused and had ambivalent feelings about his family.  He could not understand
why he was fostered
in the first place and he alternated between wanting and
not wanting contact.  At one stage the plaintiff stated he would like to
visit
his family and to be accompanied by Tom Hill.  However when Broken Hill was
contacted to make arrangements Mr Page said that
the plaintiff should at least
reply to his family's letters and send a photo before meeting them.  The
plaintiff then decided to
wait a while before attempting any contact.  The
plaintiff stated that he felt he led a "white man's life" and his family led an
entirely different life.  The plaintiff had a strong positive relationship with
Tom Hill, spending weekends and school holidays with
him and his family.  It
was felt that the plaintiff would gain the support he required from Tom as far
as his family was concerned.
<P>

(22)	In November 1983 the plaintiff changed his name to Christopher Johnson.
<P>

(23)	In April 1984 the plaintiff's father approached the Department and
arranged that he and the plaintiff's brother Glen visit
the plaintiff at
Weroona.  That meeting took place.  After this meeting the plaintiff began
talking a lot about his family back in
Wilcannia and he was very keen to spend
a weekend followed by a week there at a later date.  The plaintiff wrote to his
parents.
 A report concluded that if approached in a sensitive and gradual way,
it would be good for the plaintiff to spend some time in Wilcannia
and have
natural family contact.  
<P>

(24)	In June 1984 both the plaintiff and his parents were keen to meet at
Wilcannia.  On 23 and 24 September 1984 the plaintiff
together with Tom Hill
visited the plaintiff's parents at Wilcannia.  This was the plaintiff's first
visit home since being placed
in care and he was now 16 years of age.
<P>

(25)	A report dated October 1984 stated that the plaintiff had maintained a
good relationship with his former foster family and
according to the report the
plaintiff was pleased he had gone to Wilcannia but he could not see himself
living there in the future
as he did not like the lifestyle and general feeling
of nothing to do.  Coupled with the fact there was virtually no chance of any
meaningful employment in Wilcannia caused the plaintiff to feel that at this
stage of his life he had no future there.
<P>

<b><u>Sexual assault</u></b>
<P>

(26)	In 1982/1983 at about the time the movie "Mad Max" came out the plaintiff
was told by government social workers at Weroona
that they were going to give
him to a man who would take him out for the weekend.  A man whose last name was
Kevin came and picked
up the plaintiff and took him to Mr Kevin's mother's
place at Leeton.  He was sexually abused by Mr Kevin at Leeton.  Mr Kevin lived
at Richmond.  The plaintiff did not tell his houseparents Mr and Mrs Weir about
the assault.  The plaintiff told another young fellow
at Minali named Bert
McDonald who explained it to the Weirs.  He was reluctant to mention this
incident to a female government person
whose name he cannot now recall.  He
told a female social worker about this around the time of the assault and he
was not required
to stay with Mr Kevin again.  In latter years he mentioned the
sexual assault to Ms Hill and Mr Tobin, his barrister.  The plaintiff
was not
sure whether he was at Faulconbridge primary school or Springwood high school
when the incident occurred.  There are references
in the DOCS file as to who
the plaintiff stayed with when he was fostered out for a holiday or weekend but
there is no reference
to Mr Kevin.
<P>

	<b><u>15 to 18 years of age</u></b>
<P>

(27)	In 1985 the plaintiff gained his school certificate.  A school reference
dated November 1985 recorded that the plaintiff had
worked well and had matured
into a friendly co-operative person, a student able to work with the minimum of
supervision who reacted
well to constructive criticism.  His November 1985
school report commended his steady work rate in mathematics, remarkable
improvement
in wood technics as well as his sporting prowess.
<P>

(28)	In December 1985 when the plaintiff was 17 years of age, Weroona was
closed and all the wards and staff left.  For a short
time after the closure of
Weroona the plaintiff was able to stay at the home of an officer of the
Department Mr Tom Hill but from
April 1986 he left and had to fend for himself.
No alternative accommodation was made available or offered to him by the
Department.
 The plaintiff began living on the streets and for several years he
drank excessively, was from time to time violent and spent time
in gaol.  
<P>

(29)	In summary between the ages of 4 to 18 years, despite the Department
recording the importance of the plaintiff maintaining
contact with his natural
family, the plaintiff met his sisters when he was 8, received a letter from his
father when he was 10 years
of age and wrote a reply.  When he was 11 he met
his natural father on one occasion.  In 1983 when the plaintiff was 15 years he
received two letters, one from his sisters and one from an aunt and some
photographs of his natural family.  In 1984 when the plaintiff
was 16 years old
his father and brother visited him in Sydney and he visited his family at
Wilcannia.
<P>

(30)	On 13 November 1986 the plaintiff's wardship was determined.
<P>

	<b><u>Period after wardship was determined to date</u></b>
<P>

(31)	It was in the late 1980's when the plaintiff was living on the streets and
getting drunk that he became violent by king hitting
and punching people in the
head.  It was at that time that he came to believe that the chastisement he
received from Mr and Mrs Salmon
was physical abuse and violence (t 33/4).
<P>

(32)	On 19 December 1989 the plaintiff was arrested and charged with murder.
He appeared at Blacktown Local Court on 20 December
1989.  He was refused bail
and was sent to Parramatta gaol.  Mrs Salmon visited him once when he was in
gaol.
<P>

(33)	In 1990 and 1991 while in gaol at Parramatta the plaintiff had contact
with Margaret Hall a social worker.  He recalled having
a conversation with her
about his childhood and the problems he had living with the foster family.  He
told her that he was sexually
assaulted by a visitor to the boys' home and as a
result he felt shame and disgust which caused him to drink heavily (t 22).  She
advised him that he should find out if he could do something about it but she
was not the one to deal with it.  As he thought he
was facing life imprisonment
at the time he was not in the frame of mind to pursue the matter any further.
In 1990 Dr Lewin reported
that the plaintiff has a likely diagnosis of alcohol
addiction and would probably fulfil the full criteria for a diagnosis of Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
<P>

(34)	In December 1991 the plaintiff stood trial and was represented by
barrister Terrence Healey.  The plaintiff was sentenced to
two years
imprisonment backdated to the date of his arrest which meant that he was
released immediately.  
<P>

(35)	After the plaintiff's release from gaol and up to mid 1995 he continued to
drink fairly heavily.  He continued to display violence
on occasions.  He did
not live at any one address for any lengthy period but lived for short periods
in Bathurst, Newcastle, Port
Macquarie, Taree and Kempsey and several Sydney
suburbs.  During this period he was living in stolen cars, parks, on the street
and
squats.  He stayed wherever he found accommodation for the night (t 2).  He
did not have a permanent home.
<P>

(36)	However, during the period referred to above (from late 1992 to mid 1995)
the plaintiff undertook a course at the Visual and
Performing Arts Centre and
obtained his diploma.  Since then he has been able to teach and be involved in
drama production.
<P>

(37)	In about June 1994 the plaintiff was charged with causing malicious
damage.  He was fined $60 and given a 2 year good behaviour
bond.  The
plaintiff spoke to Terrence Healey barrister and during the conversation the
plaintiff said "I have heard that some Aboriginal
people taken away from their
families are starting court action."  Mr Healey advised the plaintiff to get as
much paper work as he
could and advised him that he might have a good case.  Mr
Healey suggested to the plaintiff that he consult a solicitor in Canberra.
 The
plaintiff did not follow this suggestion as he did not know any solicitors in
Canberra.  Mr Healey also told the plaintiff to
make enquiries with his own
people and to get back in touch with him when he had further material.  They
spoke on the telephone once.
 The plaintiff lost contact with Mr Healey when he
(Mr Healey) went to New Zealand for 2 years between 1994 and 1996.  Nor did the
plaintiff have the resources to make further enquiries and he cannot remember
if he sent Mr Healey any material.
<P>

(38)	In early 1995 the plaintiff contacted DOCS at Broken Hill.  He asked them
to supply him with his files but the department did
not do so.
<P>

(39)	In mid 1995 the plaintiff returned to Wilcannia to try and re-establish
contact with his natural family and to meet them before
they died.  He found
that his father had died 3 years previously having apparently tried to
re-establish contact with him for some
years.  He found that his mother was
"brain dead" and two of his sisters were dying of chronic alcoholism.  Two
other sisters were
unwilling to re-establish any relationship with him.  In
1996 his elder brother died of a heart attack.  
<P>

(40)	In late 1995 or possibly early 1996 the plaintiff's partner Robyn
Puckeridge suggested that he should see a solicitor regarding
his treatment at
the hands of the government and his foster parents.  At this time he moved from
Wilcannia to Broken Hill.  He later
became the manager of its Aboriginal hostel
and taught drama and video production to a group of students.  He has recently
made a
movie.
<P>

(41)	On 8 February 1996 the plaintiff attended an open forum organised by
Linkup Aboriginal Corporation on the subject of "Let's
Talk About the National
Enquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Families"
at Broken Hill.
<P>

(42)	In late 1995 and early 1996 the plaintiff consulted John Sheldon a
solicitor with Western Aboriginal Legal Aid Services at
Broken Hill to seek
assistance in obtaining historical information about himself.  Mr Sheldon
informed the plaintiff that he had
sought to obtain the plaintiff's complete
file from the DOCS.  During the remainder of 1996 the plaintiff contacted DOCS
either by
telephone or personally at least once a week trying to obtain his
file.  On 22 April 1996 Mr Sheldon requested the department to
provide him with
the file.  At some time between April and October 1996 Mr Sheldon and the
plaintiff perused parts of the departmental
file.  In April 1996 Mr Sheldon
received Ms Hall's notes.  It was not until January 1997 that the Department
provided their files
to the Western Aboriginal Legal Service.  In January 1997
the plaintiff returned to live in Sydney.
<P>

(43)	On 3 April 1997 the plaintiff was examined by Dr Robert Gertler.  In his
report dated 8 April 1997 Dr Gertler stated that in
his opinion the plaintiff's
experiences as a foster child during his crucial formative years led to
subsequent criminal activity.
 Dr Gertler said that the nexus was a direct one
in the sense that the plaintiff was exposed to violence and became violent in
turn.
 It was indirect in the sense that the plaintiff was rejected by his
family of origin and left totally unprepared to cope with an
adult world with
no role models to rely upon and no secure structure and that "the plaintiff's
anti-social behaviour was designed
to provide a legal structure".  It is Dr
Gertler's view that the plaintiff was suffering from chronic depression.
<P>

(44)	On  12 May 1997 Mr P W Gray and Mr Tobin QC were briefed to consider the
materials which Carroll and &amp; O'Dea had gathered
including the files from
the Department of Youth and Community Services and to draft all necessary
pleadings.
<P>

(45)	On 24 July 1997 the statement of claim was filed.
<P>

(46)	On 22 May 1998 a notice of motion was filed seeking an extension of time
pursuant to s 60G of the Act.
<P>

(47)	On 22 March 1999 an amended notice of motion was filed seeking an
extension of time pursuant to s 58(2) and s 60G.
<P>

<b><u>The Law</u></b>
<P>

6	The plaintiff relies on s 58(2), 60G and 60I of the Act in relation to the
claim of breaches of statutory duty and negligence.
 The parties agreed that
this is the applicable law. The approach to be adopted in dealing with
applications for the extension of
limitation periods, is that which has been
expounded in recent times in <b><u>Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v
Taylor</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186 CLR 541</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=139%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">139 ALR 1</a>;  <b><u>BHP Steel (AIS) Pty
Limited v Giudice (&amp; Ors)</u></b> (NSWCA, unreported, 7 March 1997) and
<b><u>Commonwealth of Australia v McLean</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2041%20NSWLR%20393" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 41 NSWLR 393.</a>  The onus
rests with the applicant.  
<P>

7	Section 58 falls within subdivision (1) of Division (3) and ss 60G and 60I
fall within subdivision (3) of Division (3) of the
Act.
<P>

<b>	Subdivision (1)</b>
<P>

8	Section 58(2) provides for the extension of the limitation period in respect
of a cause of action founded on negligence, nuisance
or breach of duty for
damages for personal injury.  Section 58(2) provides as follows:
<P>

	<b>"Where, on application to a court by a person claiming to have a cause of
action to which this section applies, it appears to the
court that:-</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	any of the material facts of a decisive character relating to the cause
of action was not within the means of knowledge of the
applicant until a date
after the commencement of the year preceding the expiration of the period of
limitation for the cause of action;
 and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	there is evidence to establish the right of action, apart from a defence
founded on the expiration of a limitation period,</b>
<P>

<b>	the court may order that the period of limitation for the action be
extended so that it expires at the end of 1 year after that date..."</b>
<P>

9	The power thus granted to the court to extend the limitation period is
limited to a power to extend that period only until a date
one year after the
date upon which the plaintiff became aware of the last of the material facts
necessary to be known by him.  The
defendant agrees that the date of the
application to the court is the date of filing the statement of claim namely 24
July 1997.
 The date upon which the plaintiff in fact became aware of the
material facts is thus of vital importance in this case, where the
statement of
claim in respect of a cause of action was not filed until 24 July 1997.  The
plaintiff cannot succeed under s 58 unless
he can show that he was unaware of
all necessary material facts until a date after 24 July 1996.  
<P>

10	The plaintiff submitted that the last date of the expiration of the
limitation period was 6 years after the plaintiff turned
20 years as the
Minister owed the plaintiff a duty of care pursuant to s 25 of the <b>Act</b>
until he was 20 years of age.  The defendant contended that the limitation
period expired 6 years after the plaintiff attained the
age of 18 years.
Section 52(1)(d) of the Act refers to the limitation period being suspended for
the period that the plaintiff was
under a disability.  The plaintiff was under
a legal disability until he attained 18 years of age.  It is my view that the
limitation
period expired 6 years after the plaintiff reached his majority,
namely 2 August 1992.
<P>

11	In practical terms, the plaintiff, to open the way to an exercise of the
court's discretion under this subdivision of the Act,
must identify one or more
"material facts of a decisive character relating to the cause of action";
prove (by evidence) that that
fact or one or more of these facts was unknown to
him and not within his means of knowledge as at 2 August, 1992 (the last
expiration
date of the relevant limitation period);  and either show (by
evidence) on what date (being a date after 2 August, 1992) that fact
(or the
last of those facts to become known to him) became known to him (or came within
his means of knowledge) or, at the least,
show that one such fact was still not
known to him as at 24 July 1996.
<P>

12	A material fact relating to a cause of action includes the nature and extent
of the personal injury so caused - see s 57B(1)(b)(iv).
 Section 57B(1)(c)
states that facts are of decisive character if, but only if, a reasonable man
knowing those facts and having taken
appropriate advice on those facts would
regard those facts as showing that an action on the cause of action would have
a reasonable
prospect of success and resulting in an award of damages
sufficient to justify the bringing of an action.
<P>

13	Material facts in paragraph (1) of s 57B(1)(b) is not a reference to a cause
of action in negligence but is rather a reference
to the facts which constitute
the acts or omissions, including those facts which are necessary to show the
negligent character of
those acts or omissions, upon which such a cause of
action might be founded.  (<b><u>Do Carmo v Ford Excavations Pty
Limited</u></b> (1983) 154 CLR at p 234, per Dawson J).
<P>

14	The application of s 58(2) involves a three step process.  The first step is
to inquire whether the facts of which the plaintiff
was unaware were material
facts:  s 57B(1)(b).  If they were, the next step is to ascertain whether they
were of a decisive character:
 s 57B(1)(c).  If so, then it must be ascertained
whether those facts were within the means of knowledge of the plaintiff before
the specified date:  s 58(2). 
<P>

15	The plaintiff submitted that it was not until April 1997 when he read the
contents of Dr Gertler's report he became aware that
his experiences as a
foster child caused his current psychiatric condition.  The defendant submitted
that at any time from 1992 (at
the latest) the plaintiff was in a position to
commence proceedings.  According to the defendant, the plaintiff had the
wherewithal
to, and did in fact, raise these matters further with Mr Healey in
1994 and Mr Sheldon in 1995.  According to the defendant, the
plaintiff
accessed and perused his files in mid to late 1996 and the report of Dr Gertler
in 1997 did not tell him anything which
he had not known or contemplated for at
least 7 years previously and did not cause him to change his attitude or course
of conduct.
 According to the defendant, by no later than 1990 and probably
some time before, the plaintiff had formed the view that he had been
physically
abused, sexually assaulted and otherwise mistreated and he attributed his
current problems to this mistreatment and abuse.
<P>

16	I shall briefly summarise the plaintiff's state of knowledge up to 2 August
1992, the time when the limitation period expired.
 I accept that the plaintiff
did not raise the issue of physical abuse with Mrs Salmon during her lifetime
nor did he raise it with
representatives from the Department while he was under
its control because he was brought up in a family where these things were
not
mentioned.  As a child he perceived the floggings he received as being
discipline (t 17.30).  The plaintiff says that he now
appreciates he grew up in
an environment of recurrent physical abuse and an atmosphere of insecurity and
violence (t 22B.5).  He
gave evidence that by the late 1980's but prior to
going to gaol he believed that he was physically abused (t 33.35). Also at that
time he believed that the chastisement by the Salmons was physical abuse and
violence.  
<P>

17	Later in cross examination the plaintiff said that he regarded that from an
early stage, namely when he was at primary school,
the chastisement he received
by the Salmons was physical violence because this is when he started fighting
(t 34.25).  However by
that statement, I infer that the plaintiff answered that
question with the benefit of hindsight.  I do not think that a primary school
student would have understood that his involvement in fighting at school was
caused by his foster parents' alleged physical violence.
 However I accept that
in the late 1980's the plaintiff regarded the chastisement he received from the
Salmons as physical abuse
and violence.
<P>

18	From at least 1990 the plaintiff has been literate, numerate and able to
handle government forms.  On 27 March 1990 the plaintiff
told Dr Lewin that he
believed he was rejected by his biological parents when he was aged one year
and that he does not know why
he was "put away" and was "pissed off" about
that.  He also believed that his adoptive parents had rejected him.  
<P>

19	In 1991 the plaintiff's legal representatives were preparing to defend him
on the murder charge.  The plaintiff spoke to his
counsel, Mr Healey about his
early childhood experiences including the years when he lived as a foster child
with the Salmons.  He
told Mr Healey about being removed from his family in
Wilcannia and being transferred to live with the Salmon family in Sydney (t
22B).  In 1991 the plaintiff told Ms Hall, a social worker that he was
scapegoated with many of the foster family's problems and
was treated as
inferior to the rest of the foster family.  He told her that he had been
sexually assaulted by a visitor to the boys'
home and feels that the resulting
feelings of shame and disgust caused him to drink heavily.  Ms Hall advised him
to do something
about it but she was not the one to deal with it.  I accept
that in 1991 the plaintiff had difficulties with excessive alcohol consumption,
may have met the criteria for PTSD and was facing a murder trial so that he was
not in a position to pursue legal proceedings in
relation to the sexual
assault. However, I have come to the conclusion that in 1990 the plaintiff knew
that he had suffered a personal
injury namely the sexual assault.  However in
1991 the plaintiff did not know that he may have had a claim in relation to the
treatment
he received while he was a ward of the State.
<P>

	After the limitation period expired but prior to 1995, the plaintiff had been
told by Maggie Hall and had understood that something
on his department file
showed that Mr Salmon had treated him badly.  He relayed this information to Mr
Sheldon in 1995 (t 34).  After
the plaintiff's release from gaol and up to mid
1995 he continued to drink fairly heavily.  He continued to display violence on
occasions.
 He did not live at any one address for any lengthy period but lived
for short periods in Bathurst, Newcastle, Port Macquarie, Taree
and Kempsey and
several Sydney suburbs.  During this period he was living in stolen cars,
parks, on the street and squats.  He stayed
wherever he found accommodation for
the night (t 2).  He did not have a permanent home.  
<P>

21	Notwithstanding these difficulties during this same period the plaintiff was
able to complete a diploma at the Visual and Performing
Arts Centre.
<P>

22	On 3 April 1997 the plaintiff was examined by Dr Robert Gertler.  In his
report dated 8 April 1997 Dr Gertler stated that in
his opinion the plaintiff's
experiences as a foster child during his crucial formative years led to
subsequent criminal activity.
 Dr Gertler said that the nexus was a direct one
in the sense that the plaintiff was exposed to violence and became violent in
turn.
 It was indirect in the sense that the plaintiff was rejected by his
family of origin and left totally unprepared to cope with an
adult world with
no role models to rely upon and no secure structure and that the plaintiff's
anti-social behaviour was designed
to provide a legal structure.  It is Dr
Gertler's view that the plaintiff is suffering from chronic depression.  
<P>

23	The plaintiff has given little evidence as to what he understood after he
read the contents of Dr Gertler's report.  In the plaintiff's
affidavit he
deposed that he was examined by Dr Gertler on 3 April 1997 and the doctor
provided two reports dated 8 April 1997 and
22 April 1997 to his solicitor (Aff
para 28).  The plaintiff does not state that he actually read the report nor
what he understood
from reading it.  However during cross examination the
plaintiff said that he did not realise what the Salmons were doing to him
was
not normal chastisement but violence until after he read Dr Gertler's report (t
35.5).  This statement has to be considered in
the light of the other evidence
he gave on this topic.  I turn to the statements that the plaintiff made in
cross examination relating
to the chastisement and violence he experienced
while being a member of the Salmon Family.  As previously stated, in cross
examination,
the plaintiff said that by the late 1980's but prior to going to
gaol he believed that the chastisement by the Salmons was physical
abuse and
violence yet he also said that he did not realise that what the Salmons were
doing to him was not normal chastisement but
violence until after he read Dr
Gertler's report.  It is difficult to reconcile these two statements.  
<P>

24	I have carefully analysed and reflected on the plaintiff's evidence.
Further in cross examination the plaintiff said that in
his mind it became
physical violence when he inflicted violence on other people (t 32.50).  He
also stated that he was not really
sure when he first came to the realisation
that the chastisement by the Salmons was physical abuse and violence (t 34.15)
but he
did not think that the realisation came when he was smashing someone's
head in (t 34.25).  I have reluctantly come to the view that
by the late 1980's
but prior to 1992 the plaintiff knew that the chastisement by the Salmons
constituted physical abuse and violence.
 The plaintiff did not give any
evidence to the effect that he did not know that the cause of his depression
was the treatment he
received as a foster child.  Nor does he give any evidence
to the effect that after reading Dr Gertler's report he understood that
his
experiences as a foster child who was exposed to violence caused him to be
violent in turn.  
<P>

25	I have also come to the conclusion that in 1991 the plaintiff was aware that
he had been sexually assaulted while at Weroona.
 In 1991 the plaintiff knew
that the sexual assault resulted in feelings of shame and disgust and caused
him to drink heavily.  While
the plaintiff was living on the streets in various
country towns and several Sydney suburbs from 1992 to 1995 he was able to
complete
a diploma.  He was in a position to seek legal advice by late 1995 or
1996 when he saw the solicitor John Sheldon.  The plaintiff
has not given
evidence as to when he became aware that he had a cause of action that has a
reasonable prospect of success.  The plaintiff
has not discharged his onus of
proof.  The plaintiff has not established on the balance of probabilities that
his experiences as
a foster child caused his current psychiatric condition.  He
has not established that he was unaware of a material fact of a decisive
character within the time period stipulated in s 58(2).  The plaintiff's
application for an extension of the limitation period pursuant
to s 58(2)
fails.
<P>

26	I turn to ss 60G and 60I of the Act.  The procedure provided by this group
of provisions falls into subdivision (3), is available
for causes of action
that accrue after 1 September 1990;  but "also (by the operation of Schedule 5)
for causes of action that accrued
before that date" (s 60F).  
<P>

27	Schedule 5 provides by clause 4(1) that:
<P>

	<b>"Section 60G also applies to a cause of action, founded on negligence,
nuisance or breach of duty, being a cause of action that accrued
or would have
accrued before 1 September 1990...";</b>
<P>

and clause 4(4) empowers the court to make an order under s 60G in respect of
such a cause of action:
<P>

	<b>"...if an application for such order is made within:</b>
<P>

<b> (a)	the period of three years referred to in s 60I;  or</b>
<P>

<b> (b)	the period of three years commencing 1 September 1990."</b>
<P>

28	The statement of claim was filed on 24 July 1997 which is outside the time
stipulated in clause 4(4)(b).  The application can
only succeed if that date is
shown to be "within the period of three years referred to in s 60I".
<P>

29	Section 60G empowers the court to extend the limitation period, if it is
just and reasonable to do so, "for such a period as
it determines".
<P>

30	The relevant provisions of s 60I are as follows:
<P>

	<b>"(1)	A court may not make an order under s 60G or 60H unless it is
satisfied that:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the plaintiff:</b>
<P>

<b>(i)	did not know that personal injury had been suffered;  or</b>
<P>

<b>(ii)	was unaware of the nature or extent of personal injury suffered;
or</b>
<P>

<b>(iii)	was unaware of the connection between the personal injury and the
defendant's act or omission, at the expiration of the relevant
limitation
period or at a time before that expiration when proceedings might reasonably
have been instituted;  and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the application is made within three 	years after the plaintiff became
aware (or ought to have become aware) of all three matters
listed in paragraph
(a)(i)-(iii)."</b>
<P>

31	Thus to gain access to the beneficial provisions of s 60G, the plaintiff
must show that:
<P>

(1)	As at 2 August, 1992 (the expiration of the relevant limitation period) he
was unaware of one or more of the matters identified
in s 60I(1)(a)(i), (ii) or
(iii).
<P>

(2)	That he did not become aware of that or those or he ought to have become
aware in s 60I(1)(a) (or the last of those matters
to become known to him)
earlier than 24 July 1994.
<P>

32	The practical effect is to require the plaintiff to identify specifically
what fact or facts he claims not to have known as at
2 August, 1992, which lack
of knowledge meets the description in one or more of paragraphs (i), (ii) and
(iii) of s 60I(1)(a);  and
to show (by evidence) the date on which he acquired
knowledge thereof (being a date later than 24 July 1994);  or to show that that
fact was or those facts were still unknown to him on that date.  The defendant
did not submit that the plaintiff ought to have become
aware of the matters
listed in paragraphs (i)-(iii) at an earlier date - see s 60I(1)(b).
<P>

33	Counsel indicated that the plaintiff relied on s 60I(1)(a)(i)(ii) and (iii)
and as with s 58(2) the plaintiff submitted that
it was not until April 1997
when he became aware of the contents of Dr Gertler's report that he became
aware that his experiences
as a foster child caused his current psychiatric
condition.  As with s 58(2) the defendant made the same submission that by 1990
at the latest the plaintiff had formed the view that he had been physically
abused, sexually assaulted and otherwise mistreated and
he attributed his
current problems to this mistreatment and abuse.
<P>

<b> (i)	<u>Whether the plaintiff has proved that "he did not know that a
personal injury had been suffered</u>"</b>
<P>

34	For the reasons given in relation of s 58(2) of this judgment, in 1991 the
plaintiff knew that he had been sexually assaulted
and that it resulted in
feelings of shame and disgust and caused him to drink heavily.  By the late
1980's and prior to going to
gaol the plaintiff knew that he had suffered a
personal injury.  By 1992 the plaintiff also knew that the chastisement by the
Salmons
was physical abuse and violence.  He knew that he had suffered
physical injury which included strap marks from being hit with a strap.
 He
does not give any evidence as to when he knew that he suffered a psychiatric
injury namely depression.  The plaintiff's knowledge
that he suffered a
personal injury was acquired prior to 24 July 1994.  Accordingly the
plaintiff's claim under s 60I(1)(a)(i) fails.
<P>

<b>(ii)</b>	<b><u>Whether the plaintiff has proved that he was "unaware of
the</u></b> 	<b><u>nature or extent of the personal injury suffered"</u></b>
<P>

35	The test of knowledge posed by s 60I(1)(a)(ii) requires the court to look at
the actual awareness of the plaintiff.  Neither
the reasonableness of that
awareness nor constructive knowledge is an element of s 60I(1)(a) -
(<b><u>Harris v Commercial Minerals Limited</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 49</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%2d96%29%20186%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995-96) 186 CLR 1</a> at pp 9
and 10).  However, s 60I(1)(b) imposes an objective test - "became aware (or
ought to have become aware)" of all three matters
listed in paragraphs
(a)(i)-(iii). 
<P>

36	The nature and extent of the injury which the plaintiff has sustained is to
be determined as at the date of the hearing of the
application
(<b><u>Harris</u></b> pp 13 and 14).  A plaintiff may be held to have been
aware of the nature or extent of his injury within the relevant period if
during
that period he was aware of the effect which the injury was then having
upon him and of its likely future course, even though he
may have been unaware
of the precise pathology or medical diagnosis.  On the other hand, knowledge of
the medical diagnosis will
not itself amount to knowledge of the nature and
extent of the injury if the plaintiff is unaware of significant aspects of the
prognosis,
for example that the injury is permanent and will not be amenable to
treatment;  or that it may deteriorate with the passage of time.
 As long as
the consequences are of a kind that the plaintiff expects, the plaintiff will
be aware of the extent of the injury.
<P>

37	On the topic of awareness, the High Court referred to a passage from
<b><u>Deming No 456 Pty Ltd v Brisbane Unit Development Corporation Pty
Ltd</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 44</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20155%20CLR%20129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 155 CLR 129</a> at 151, where it said that the meaning of the
words "first becomes aware of" in a Queensland statute is equally applicable to
the
term "unaware" in s 60I(1)(a):
<P>

	<b>"[T]he very words `become aware' strongly indicate that the statute is
looking to the purchaser's actual knowledge of the failure
which, by
description, is a failure to comply with the statutory provisions.  We conclude
that the words `becomes aware of the failure'
in s 49(5) involve not only
knowledge that a statement containing the specified material has not been given
but an awareness that
the fact that such a statement was not given constitutes
a `failure' to do something which the Act says should be done."</b>
<P>

38	The words "become aware" mean that the plaintiff must have knowledge and
awareness of the fact that such a statement was given.
 As previously stated by
1991 the plaintiff was aware that he had been sexually assaulted while at
Weroona.  Also by 1991 the plaintiff
knew that the experience of being sexually
assaulted resulted in feelings of shame and disgust and caused him to drink
heavily.
<P>

39	Also as previously stated earlier in this judgment it is my view that by the
late 1980's but prior to 1992 the plaintiff knew
that the chastisement by the
Salmons was physical abuse and violence.  Also as previously stated the
plaintiff did not give any evidence
to establish that he did not know that the
cause of him suffering depression was the treatment he received as a foster
child.  Nor
does he give evidence that after reading Dr Gertler's report he
understood that his experiences as a foster child when being exposed
to
violence caused him to be violent in turn.  For the reasons given earlier in
this judgment, in relation to the s 58(2) application,
the plaintiff did not
give evidence to establish on the balance of probabilities after reading Dr
Gertler's report in 1997 that his
experiences as a foster child caused his
current psychiatric condition.  I am not satisfied that the plaintiff was
unaware of the
nature or extent of his injury within the time period stipulated
in s 60I(1)(a)(ii).  The claim under s 60I(1)(a)(ii) fails.
<P>

<b>(iii)</b>	<b><u>Whether the plaintiff was unaware of the connection between
</u></b>	<b><u>personal injury and the defendant's act or omission</u></b>
<P>

40	Section 60I(1)(a)(iii) is concerned with ignorance of the existence of acts
and omissions rather than legal conclusions.  The
acts or omissions referred to
in s 60I(1)(a)(iii) are the acts or omissions on which the plaintiff relies to
found the cause of action
referred to in s 60G.  Those acts or omissions, will
be found in the plaintiff's particulars of negligence.  -  <b><u>Drayton Coal
Board Pty Limited v Drain</u></b> (NSWCA Gleeson CJ, unreported 22 August
1995).
<P>

41	Once again, for the reasons given earlier the plaintiff did not give
evidence to establish that after reading Dr Gertler's report
in 1997 he became
aware that his experience as a foster child caused his current psychiatric
condition.  
<P>

42	The plaintiff gave evidence in relation to the discipline he received from
Mrs Salmon.  He said "I see it as the Government had
a job to do, to go and
check out nothing was happening, but they didn't."  (t 17.25)  However, it is
not clear when the plaintiff
acquired the knowledge that the Government had a
responsibility towards him and allegedly failed in carrying out their
responsibility.
 In his affidavit (para 30) the plaintiff deposed that on 12
May 1997 Mr Gray of Counsel was briefed as junior to Mr Tobin QC to
consider
materials which Carroll and O'Dea had gathered including the Youth and
Community Services files and to draft all necessary
pleadings.  On 13 June 1997
Counsel provided joint advice to the plaintiff's solicitor and a draft
statement of claim.  The plaintiff
maintains his claim for privilege over that
advice.  Nowhere in his affidavit nor in his evidence does the plaintiff
disclose what
he understood were the acts and omissions upon which he relies to
found his cause of action.  Nor does he disclose when he became
aware of those
acts and omissions.  
<P>

43	In 1991 the plaintiff had been told by Maggie Hall that he should find out
if he could do something about the sexual assault
but she was not the one to
deal with it.  As previously stated I accept that the plaintiff was not in a
position to seek legal advice
about it until late 1995 or early 1996.  However
as referred to above the plaintiff did not give evidence of what were the acts
or
omissions which he relied upon nor when he became aware of those acts or
omissions.  Rather he only says that counsel provided joint
advice to his
solicitors.  The plaintiff has failed to discharge his onus of proof.  The
plaintiff has not established that he was
unaware of the connection between the
personal injury and the defendant's acts or omissions within the time frame
stipulated.  His
claim under s 60I (1)(a)(iii) fails.
<P>

44	The plaintiff has not satisfied the provisions of s 58(2) and s
60I(1)(a)(i)-(iii) so his application to extend the limitation
period fails.
If I am wrong and the plaintiff has passed through either s 58(2) or s 60I(1)
gateways I turn to consider whether it
is just and reasonable to extend the
limitation period.
<P>

<b>Just and reasonable</b>
<P>

45	Firstly, I turn to consider whether the plaintiff has a real case to
advance.  The defendant submitted that the plaintiff did
not have a cause of
action.  In relation to s 58(2) and s 60G, the applicant bears an evidentiary
and persuasive onus which, in the
absence of concession, requires material to
be adduced which demonstrates that the dilatory plaintiff has a real case to
advance.
 The need for the court to decide that it is just and reasonable to
extend the limitation period must focus attention on the question
whether there
is indeed evidence to establish the plaintiff's cause of action.  It would
rarely be possible to say that it was just
and reasonable to subject the
defendant to litigation otherwise statute barred if it did not appear that
there was evidence available
to the plaintiff to establish his cause of action.

<P>

	<b>"It is easy to overlook the all important emphasis upon the word
`reasonable' in the statement of the duty.  Perfection or the use
of increased
knowledge or experience embraced in hindsight after the event should form no
part of the components of what is reasonable
in all the circumstances.  That
matter must be judged in prospect and not in retrospect.  The likelihood of the
incapacitating occurrence,
the likely extent of the injuries which the
occurrence may cause, the nature and extent of the burden of providing a
safeguard which
would do so are all indispensable considerations in determining
what ought reasonably to be done."</b>
<P>

47	The defendant tendered an article entitled "Black Children:  White Welfare?"
Aboriginal Child Welfare Law and Policy in New South
Wales by Richard Chisholm
dated April 1995 (Social Welfare Research Centre, University of NSW) (the
article) and evidence that supports
its case that it treated the plaintiff in
accordance with prevailing policies and in accordance with the <b>Child Welfare
Act</b> 1939.  At Chapter 4 p 98 of the article, the author examines three
phases of child welfare reforms and Aboriginal policy.  The first
phase was
constituted by the regime of the Aborigines Protection Board and later the
Aborigines Welfare Board, covering the period
1883-1969.  In this period,
Aboriginal child welfare was seen as part of the white man's response to the
"Aboriginal problem", a
response which consisted of establishing a special
authority considered that the "welfare" of Aboriginal people would be promoted
by measures designed to make them like white people, so they could take their
place in the "wider" society.  By the 1960's, however,
the view came to prevail
that this objective was not likely to be advanced by the continuation of a
separate authority to have powers
over Aboriginal people and that such an
authority in fact constituted a threat to their civil liberties.  The abolition
of the Aborigines
Welfare Board in 1969 marks the end of the first phase.
<P>

48	The second phase occurred between 1969 and 1980.  It is during this phase
and a few years into the third phase that the plaintiff
was a ward of the
State.  During this period, separate laws or provisions for Aboriginal people
were seen generally as unjustified,
and perhaps discriminatory.  In this second
phase, Aborigines were to be treated like everyone else.  There were to be no
special
detriments, and no special privileges, associated with being
Aboriginal.  The ordinary systems of health care, legal services, child
welfare
and so on would apply to all alike, regardless of race.  Aboriginal people had
the same rights as everyone else, in particular
the right to freedom from
discrimination.  It was proper to criticise the legal system or the health
system for any less favourable
treatment of Aboriginal people, but the notion
of equal participation in these and other social services by individuals was
seen
as marking the limits of the rights of Aboriginal people.
<P>

49	In the late 1970's, however, new and very different ideas had gained ground,
leading to what is here regarded as the third phase.
 "Self determination"
became more prominent than equality as a touchstone of justice for Aboriginal
people.  The emergence of support
for Aboriginal initiatives, especially in the
areas of legal services, health and housing, represented a new sense that
justice to
Aboriginal people includes some recognition of the rights of
Aborigines to continued existence and development as a people.  It was
not
enough, as had been previously assumed, to ensure that Aboriginal individuals
were free from discrimination.  The granting of
rights to individuals alone was
seen as another strategy for implementing the policy of assimilation, since
what was protected was
the individual Aboriginal's right to participate in the
non-Aboriginal society.  The individualistic notion of freedom from
discrimination
was consistent with a community which, having largely destroyed
Aboriginal society, gave Aboriginal people no choice but to live
according to
the rules and traditions of the alien European community.  A new view of
equality emerged, in which Aboriginal people
had a right to a place in a viable
and authentic Aboriginal community.  Since vast damage had been done to
Aboriginal society by
the European conquest, justice for Aboriginal people
required that steps be taken to assist them in consolidating and developing
their culture, traditions, and identity.
<P>

50	In 1987 the <b>Children (Care and Protection) Act</b> came into force.
Section 87 of that <b>Act</b> provides that an Aboriginal child should as far
as practicable be placed in the care of a member of the child's extended family
as
recognised by the Aboriginal community to which the child belonged.
<P>

51	Mr Erin Queen who was employed by what is now known as the DOCS  from 1951
to 1991, and was from 1958 to 1969 a district officer
who dealt with child
protection matters, including those relating to indigenous as well as
non-indigenous children swore an affidavit.
 He has outlined the policies in
the department from 1973 to 1983.  By 1973 similar policy and practice in child
protection applied
to indigenous and non-indigenous children but departmental
experience at that time was that there were great difficulties in placing
indigenous children in longer term foster care and succeeding in the longer
term foster care of indigenous children.  Consequently
there was a strong
department emphasis on keeping indigenous children out of care.  That
ordinarily involved examination of and usually
placement with or garnering the
support of the children's extended family.  The department would go to
considerable lengths to make
arrangements for the indigenous children to stay
with the extended family.  It was the breakdown of the ability of the immediate
and extended family to provide for the child which led to indigenous children
coming into care.
<P>

52	In 1973 the principal influences in child protection were  - (a)  the
<b>Child Welfare Act</b>.  Its policies and practices focused on the concept of
the neglected child;  (b)  the abolition of the Aboriginal Welfare Board and
the consequences thereof;  (c)  relevant judgment of superior courts;  and (d)
departmental policy, which emphasised that the welfare
and interest of the
child was the paramount consideration.
<P>

53	The family situation of an indigenous child had to be extreme to cause the
departmental officers to make application under the
Act.  In this period the
department seldom had any indigenous foster families and departmental
experience led to the placement of
indigenous children in "non-Aboriginal"
areas, such as parts of the Sydney region because departmental officers had
found that the
placement of an indigenous child with a white family at, for
example, Kempsey or Wilcannia created racial tensions not in the best
interest
of the ward.
<P>

54	According to Mr Quinn review of the files also disclosed that the placement
of the plaintiff with his foster family, the Salmons,
although obviously hoped
to be a long term placement appeared to suffer a typical breakdown in
adolescence and in that respect appears
a fairly typical story particularly
given that there was no recorded history of physical or sexual abuse.  He
referred to Mrs Balford's
complaint concerning the foster family and considered
that it was not of that nature.  There are no other known complaints concerning
the plaintiff's care from the plaintiff or any other source.  The breakdown of
a placement of a child within a foster family commonly
occurred when the foster
child was aged 12 or 14 years.
<P>

55	According to Mr Quinn the restoration of wards to the natural family was not
the main objective of the department in the period
1973 to 1983 unless the
natural parent situation had improved within a reasonable time after the child
became a ward.  In the 1970's
there was significantly less community resources
available to support and encourage the improvement of the situation of the
ward's
natural family.  Prior to 1980 it was difficult for a natural parent to
seek other than administrative review of any decision concerning
a ward.
<P>

56	It is Mr Quinn's view that departmental records disclose that the plaintiff
was dealt with in accordance with the then accepted
and applied principles and
policies then considered to be in the best interest of the child.  The orders
and arrangements at that
time were in accordance with the departmental policy
and the requirements of the Act.  The plaintiff's subsequent fostering and time
in departmental care was also in accordance with existing practice and
policies.  The departmental records do not disclose facts
or circumstances
indicating that the plaintiff should not have been taken into care nor that
there was other than proper care provided
to him.
<P>

57	Mr Robinson who is currently the Assistant Manager of the Complaints
Investigation and Review Commission gave evidence and was
cross examined.  He
had responsibility for the supervision of the plaintiff's foster parents from
August 1978 to September 1981.
 Mr Robinson formed the view that Mrs Salmon was
committed to doing her best for the plaintiff.  He found Mr Salmon pragmatic
and
recalled that Mr Salmon thought the plaintiff would eventually return to
his origins.  Mr Robinson considered Mr Salmon to have clear
but not derogatory
views about cultural differences (Aff 6).  He has no recollection of the
Salmons making derogatory comments to
the plaintiff.  Mr Robinson conceded in
cross examination that if a child was subject to racist and derogatory remarks
on the basis
of his skin, he would consider it to be a very serious breach of
the obligations of the foster parents (t 46.5).  As part of his
role of
supervising families and children who were placed with them he would visit the
household at least four times a year.  Sometimes
these visits were short, some
were comprehensive and he would also ensure that he saw the child alone at
least once each year.  His
aim at such times was to endeavour to forge a strong
relationship with the child and thereby assist the child and the foster
family.
<P>

58	Mr Robinson stated that he regarded it as a necessary part of his
supervising duties to actually visit the household where the
plaintiff was
fostered four times per year but conceded that he did not necessarily visit the
foster child but rather the foster
parents during school hours.  His
recollection is that he fulfilled his obligation to visit the household four
times per year (t
15.30).  He may have interviewed the plaintiff in the
principal's office at school for 15 or 30 minutes.  Mr Robinson also stated
that if the plaintiff had been told when he went to Minali assessment centre
that he was going away on a holiday, that it was inappropriate
and extremely
cruel and would, in the worst situation have a distressing effect on the child
and in 1981 this behaviour would not
have been tolerated (t 50).
<P>

59	The question to be decided at trial is whether the defendants' conduct
accords to the standard of reasonable care demanded by
the law and this should
be understood in the light of Barwick CJ's comments in <b><u>Mahoney</u></b>.
In relation to duty of care that was owed to the plaintiff by the defendant,
the plaintiff's counsel referred to the decision of
the Court of Appeal in
<b><u>Youngman v Lawson</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20NSWLR%20439" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1 (1981) NSWLR 439.</a>  In that case Street CJ
(with whom Reynolds and Glass JJA agreed) stated that the <b>Child Welfare
Act</b> contained no definition of "guardian" or "guardianship" (at p 445).
Street CJ referred to some provisions of the <b>Child Welfare</b> <b>Act</b> to
demonstrate the unsoundness of attempting to deduce from the <b>Child
Welfare</b> <b>Act</b> as a whole whether any, and if so what gloss should be
put on the word "guardianship" in s 72(j).  He concluded that there was no
adequate consistency in the draftmanship of the <b>Child Welfare</b> <b>Act</b>
to justify any general conclusion.  Street CJ in relation to s 72(j) held:
<P>

	<b>"In the first place guardianship is a relationship which, so long as it
subsists, is  recognized as conferring rights in the guardian
in respect of the
custody and upbringing (educational as well as religious) of the child.  Those
rights may be exercised by the guardian
himself or herself actually having
physical custody; or they may be exercised by the physical custody being placed
with others. 
Such other placements might be temporary and casual as, for
example, allowing a child to stay with friends for a weekend.  They may
be on a
more regular and extended basis as, for example, placing a child in a boarding
school.  They may be of an even more extended
character as, for example,
allowing the child to live with grandparents.  Such placements do not remove
the legal authority of the
guardian over the child.  Such authority will
subsist until displaced by an order of a court or the operation of a
statute."</b>
<P>

60	The plaintiff's counsel submitted that the proper definition of guardianship
is that stated by Mayo J in <b><u>Wedd v Wedd</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/sa/SAStRp/1948/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1948] SAStRp 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281948%29%20SASR%20104" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1948) SASR 104</a> where His
Honour referred to the words "custody" and "guardianship" as contained in the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/goia1940231/" class="autolink_findacts">Guardianship of Infants Act</a></b> 1940 (SA) and stated:
<P>

	<b>"It may be "guardianship" and "custody", when used in contrast, are several
aspects of the same relationship.  The former can very
well be employed in a
special context to denote duties concerning the child <i>ab extra</i>;  that
is, a warding off;  the defence, protection and guarding of the child, or his
property, from danger, harm or loss that may
enure from without.  Commonly
guardianship is used in a wider sense:  <u>Neale v Colquhoun</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/sa/SAStRp/1944/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1944] SAStRp 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1944%5d%20SASR%20119" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1944] SASR
119</a> at pp 129-130.  Custody essentially concerns control, and the preservation
and care of the child's person, physically, mentally and
morally;
responsibility for a child in regard to his needs, food, clothing, instruction,
and the like."</b>
<P>

61	The plaintiff alleges that the defendants were responsible for the care and
upbringing of him from 4 to 18 years of age during
the period 5 March 1973
until 2 August 1986 and thereafter for his support and the supervision of his
progress as a ex-ward until
he reached the age of 20 years.  
<P>

62	It is alleged that the defendants owed duties to the plaintiff which
included (a) to care for him and protect him from harm;
 (b)  to act in his
best interest in accordance with his long term needs; (c) to ensure that he was
well cared for and that his individual
interests were preserved and enhanced,
while ever he was living in the various institutions and places;  (d) to ensure
that he was
brought up with an appreciation and understanding of his
Aboriginality and that responsible efforts were made to maintain and/or
re-establish contact and meetings between the plaintiff and his natural family
and to ensure that he had support and supervision
during that time and as an
ex-ward for two years after he reached the age of 18 years.  
<P>

63	It is alleged that the defendants owed the plaintiff fiduciary duty and
duties in torts and statutory duties of similar character
by virtue of the
provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/goia1940231/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 9</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/goia1940231/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">10</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/goia1940231/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">22</a>, 23, 24, 25, 50, 53, 54, 82, 144 and 148B of the
<b>Child Welfare Act</b>.  It is alleged that the defendants breached the
duties they owed.  These breaches are particularised in para (13) of the
statement
of claim.  It is alleged that as a result the plaintiff suffers from
a psychiatric illness namely, chronic depression, acute anxiety
and post
traumatic stress disorder and as he was exposed to physical ill-treatment and
to sexual abuse he became pre-disposed to
violence himself and as he was
rejected in whole or in part by both his Aboriginal family and his foster
family he was left ill-equipped
to cope with the adult world, feeling that he
did not belong to either white or Aboriginal society.  He also claims damages
for the
trauma and separation from his own family;  the loss of opportunity to
love and to be loved by his own family;  his deprivation of
family and cultural
heritage;  loss of ability to realise his innate scholastic and academic
potential and his lack of acceptance
of and confidence in his Aboriginality and
the loss of his chance to equip himself to his potential of employment.  There
is no defence
on file.

up by judges to give effect to their own ideas of policy
and then `imputed' to
the legislature.  The legitimate endeavour of the courts is to determine what
inference really arises, on a
balance of considerations, from the nature, which
it is directed, the nature of the conduct prescribed, the pre-existing state of
the law, and, generally, the whole range of circumstances relevant upon a
question of statutory interpretation."</b>

Limited</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2042%20NSWLR%20550" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 42 NSWLR 550</a> at 555.
<P>

66	It can be argued that the defendant as guardian owed a duty to the plaintiff
to act in his interest and in a way that truly provided
a manner apt for a
fiduciary for his care.  As in <b><u>Williams</u></b> Kirby P (as he then was)
at p 511C-D stated that it is arguable that a person who suffers as a want of
proper care on the part of
fiduciary may recover equitable compensation from
the want of proper care.  As Kirby P pointed out in <b><u>Williams</u></b>, in
other jurisdictions, compensation for breach of fiduciary duty has been held to
include recompense for the injury suffered to
the plaintiff's feelings.  It can
be argued that the common law duty of care is similar to the fiduciary duty or
the statutory duty.
 In relation to breach of statutory duty, it is my view
that it is arguable that the Minister had a duty of care towards the plaintiff
when he was 17-20 years of age.  It was during that time that the plaintiff
lived on the streets and drank excessively (see s 25
of the Act).  It may also
be argued that the complaint of Mrs Balford concerning the racist comments by
the foster family should
have been investigated.  The same can also be argued
in relation to the sexual assault (see s 148B(3) of the Act).  It can also be
argued that the inspections required by s 50 of the Act and the subsequent
report to the Minister were inadequate particularly in
these circumstances
where other case workers have commented adversely about the care the plaintiff
received while fostered with the
Salmons.  It is my view that there is evidence
to demonstrate that the plaintiff has a real case to advance.
<P>

67	In <b><u>Williams</u></b> Kirby P stated at p 510 that:
<P>

	<b>"The fact that the claim for equitable compensation for breach of fiduciary
duty could not be disposed of but would (peremptory relief
apart) be required
to proceed to trial, would itself be a consideration relevant to the
determination of what it was "just and reasonable"
to do in respect of the
causes of action in tort.  The evidence relevant to the claim for breach of
fiduciary duty would be substantially
the same as the evidence relevant to the
claim for damages for the torts of negligence and wrongful detention.  If a
court concluded
that a claim for breach of fiduciary duty was bound to be
tried, it would seem strongly arguable that the alternative causes of action
upon which the same plaintiff relied at common law, should be heard at the same
time.  At the least, that would be a matter relevant
to the exercise of the
discretion under s 60G(2)."</b>
<P>

68	The passage of time and the changing perceptions of right and wrong conduct
pose as great a problem for the plaintiff as they
do for the defendant.  And
the reasonableness of permitting the plaintiff to pursue his claim for breach
of fiduciary duty which
requires no extension of time under the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation
Act</a></b>, and the causes of action for breach of statutory duty and negligence
depends on evidence largely common to the claim for equitable
compensation for
breach of fiduciary duty.
<P>

69	Kirby P in <b><u>Williams</u></b> pointed out the law which has often been
an instrument of justice to Aboriginal Australians can also, in proper cases be
an instrument
of justice in vindication of their legal rights (p 515 C).
<b><u>Williams</u></b> was decided before <b><u>Taylor</u></b>.  Consideration
must be given as to whether the defendant can obtain a fair trial or whether
will suffer significant prejudice.
<P>

70	As previously stated, <b><u>Taylor</u></b> makes it clear that it is prima
facie prejudicial to the defendant to grant an extension of time in respect of
a statute barred claim.
 The plaintiff bears the positive burden of
demonstrating that the justice of the case requires an extension - see also
Mason P in
<b><u>BHP Steel (AIS) Limited v Cinquegrana</u></b> (NSWCA,
unreported 3 September 1997).
<P>

71	In <b><u>Taylor</u></b> McHugh J referred to the effects of delay in the now
often quoted passage at p 8 which states:
<P>

<b>"The effect of delay on the quality of justice is no doubt one of the most
important influences motivating a legislature to enact
limitation periods for
commencing actions.  But it is not the only one.  Courts and commentators have
perceived four broad rationales
for the enactment of limitation periods.
First, as time goes by, relevant evidence is likely to be lost.  Secondly, it
is oppressive,
even "cruel", to a defendant to allow an action to be brought
long after the circumstances which gave rise to it have passed.  Thirdly,
people should be able to arrange their affairs and utilise their resources on
the basis that claims can no longer be made against
them.  Insurers, public
institutions and businesses, particularly limited liability companies, have a
significant interest in knowing
that they have no liabilities beyond a definite
period."</b>
<P>

72	and at page 11 he continued:
<P>

<b>"Legislatures enact limitation periods because they make a judgment, inter
alia, that the chance of an unfair trial occurring after
the limitation period
has expired is sufficiently great to require the termination of the plaintiff's
right of action at the end
of that period.  When a defendant is able to prove
that he or she will not now be able to fairly defend him or herself or that
there
is a significant chance that this is so, the case is no longer one of
presumptive prejudice.  The defendant has then proved what
the legislature
merely presumed would be the case.  Even on the hypothesis of presumptive
prejudice, the legislature perceives that
society is best served by barring the
plaintiff's action.  When actual prejudice of a significant kind is shown, it
is hard to conclude
that the legislature intended that the extension provision
should trump the limitation period.  In such a situation, actual injustice
to
one party must occur.  It seems more in accord with the legislative policy
underlying limitation periods that the plaintiff's
lost right should not be
revived than that the defendant should have a spent liability reimposed upon
it."</b>
<P>

73	Dawson J, in <b><u>Taylor</u></b> said at page 2:
<P>

<b>"The onus of satisfying the court that the discretion should be exercised in
favour of an applicant lies on the applicant.  To discharge
that onus the
applicant must establish that the commencement of an action beyond the
limitation period would not result in significant
prejudice to the prospective
defendant. I agree with McHugh J that, once the legislature has selected a
limitation period, to allow
the commencement of an action outside that period
is  prima facie prejudicial to the defendant who would otherwise have the
benefit
of the limitation."</b>
<P>

74	McHugh J at p 10 continued:
<P>

<b>"The discretion to extend should therefore be seen as requiring the
applicant to show that his or her case is a justifiable exception
to the rule
that the welfare of the State is best served by the limitation period in
question. Accordingly, when an applicant seeks
an extension of time to commence
an action after a limitation period has expired, he or she has the positive
burden of demonstrating
that the justice of the case requires that
extension."</b>
<P>

75	Toohey and Gummow JJ (in their joint judgment) at p 7 expressed themselves
in the following terms.  
<P>

<b>	"The real question is whether the delay has made the chances of a fair
trial unlikely.  If it has not there is no reason why the
discretion should not
be exercised in favour of the respondent."</b>
<P>

76	David Wells a legal officer employed by the DOCS said that he had caused
searches to be carried out concerning the file of the
plaintiff within the
Department.  Staff members and former staff members have been identified from
the files.  It was noted that
the whereabouts of A F Wilson, P Nowland, G Page,
A Weir, K Weir and W Hallins could not presently be ascertained.  
<P>

77	Subsequently the plaintiff spoke to Wayne Hallins at Penrith and he offered
to assist the plaintiff.  A F Wilson is Frank Wilson
and the plaintiff has
located him at Williamstown in South Australia.  Mr G Page is in the telephone
book and is located in the Dubbo
Juvenile Justice section.  Mr P Nowland is
still working with the DOCS and is the manager at the Tamworth branch and it is
conceded
that the defendant has since found Mr and Mrs Weir.  Mrs Salmon died
in 1996.  The defendant has located three children of the Salmon
family and the
defendant's solicitor has spoken to Mr Salmon in Thailand and has been informed
by Mr Salmon that he is prepared to
co-operate in the case.  All the staff
members and former staff members identified by the defendant have now been
located by the
plaintiff.
<P>

78	The defendant produced evidence that an important file (the W file) could
not be located.  The W file has now been located. 
The defendant concedes that
save for presumptive prejudice the defendant does not suffer actual prejudice
in relation to files and
the availability of staff to give evidence at a trial,
if there is one.
<P>

79	I accept that with the passing of time, these witnesses' memories in
relation to the events which occurred up to 25 years ago
will have dimmed.
Indisputably there will be presumptive prejudice.
<P>

80	The main factors that affect the defendant's ability to obtain a fair trial
are firstly that Mrs Salmon, the plaintiff's primary
caregiver between 1974 and
1981 died in 1996 and secondly there are no records which contain any reference
to the sexual assault.
<P>

81	Although the plaintiff told Bert McDonald of the sexual assault and he in
turn relayed this information to Mr and Mrs Weir the
plaintiff cannot be
specific as to when it occurred.  He thinks that it is around the time of the
"Mad Max" movie but could not be
sure whether he was at Faulconbridge primary
school or Springwood high school.  Although there are records with whom the
plaintiff
spent holidays and weekends, the name Kevin does not appear.
However, Mr and Mrs Weir are available to give evidence in relation
to this
incident although with the effluxion of 17 years their memories may have
dimmed.  It is not known whether Bert McDonald can
be located and be available
to give evidence.  The defendants have records that dispute the plaintiff's
evidence that he was entrusted
into the care of Mr Kevin for a weekend.
<P>

82	Although Mrs Salmon cannot give her version of events, her husband and her
children can give evidence.  The racist comments were
allegedly made by Mr
Salmon.  Mrs Salmon was mainly involved in the chastisement of the plaintiff
but Mr Salmon also played a role.
 While Mr Salmon may not have been at home
all of the time the children were and their evidence together with that of Mr
Salmon can
fill in the gaps.  I am not satisfied that the defendant will suffer
significant prejudice or will be unable to obtain a fair trial.
<P>

83	For the reasons given earlier, the plaintiff has not passed through the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s58.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
58(2)</a> or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60I</a> gateways and his action fails.  However, if I am wrong and the
plaintiff has passed through a gateway then I would have considered
that the
plaintiff had discharged his onus and I would have been satisfied that it was
just and reasonable to extend time.  The notice
of motion filed 22 May 1998 is
dismissed with costs.
<P>

84	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	I decline to extend the limitation period within which to commence
proceedings.
<P>

(2)	The notice of motion filed 22 May 1998 is dismissed.
<P>

(3)	The plaintiff is to pay the defendant's costs.
