COUNCIL</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

<b>Reasons for judgment</b>
<P>

1	In the early hours of 19 March 1987 the plaintiff, David James Black, was
injured when he lost control of his motorcycle at the
intersection of Vardy's
Road and Bowmans Road, Marayong.  (At that time the relevant section of Vardy's
Road was considered to be
part of Bowmans Road, but it is easier to use the
current nomenclature). It is his case that he lost control of the bike because
of loose material on the surface of the road, which he described as "blue
metal", which was there as a result of road works undertaken
by the defendant,
the Blacktown City Council.  The defendant denies that the road was in that
condition and, on the question of liability,
this is the central issue in the
case.
<P>

2	Vardy's Road runs roughly east to west.  Proceeding in that direction,
Bowmans Road intersects with it at about a  forty-five
degree angle on the
left, that is, on its southern side.  Immediately before that point Turbo Road
intersects with it on the right
(the northern side).  At the time of the
accident, the section of Vardy's Road to the west of Turbo Road was under
construction and
west bound traffic in Vardy's Road had to veer left into
Bowmans Road. 
<P>

	<b>The Accident</b>
<P>

3	Some distance to the east of that point Tattersall Road crosses Vardy's Road,
and the plaintiff approached Vardy's Road from the
south in Tattersall Road.
He stopped at the intersection to give way to a car approaching from his right
in Vardy's Road.  He then
turned left into Vardy's Road and overtook that car
at a point about 50 metres east of Turbo Road.  He said that his speed reached
about 80 kph in the process but he had slowed down by the time he reached
Bowmans Road.  He applied his brake to negotiate the bend,
but he denied
braking heavily or going into a skid. 
<P>

4	It was there, he said, that he struck the material on the road.  Although his
headlight was on, he did not notice that material
until he was "right on top of
it".  He immediately lost control of the bike and was unable to regain it.  The
bike veered off the
roadway and his next recollection was waking up at
Blacktown Hospital.
<P>

5	The plaintiff was familiar with the area where the accident occurred.  He was
an experienced motorcyclist, and he said that it
is impossible to control a
cycle on material such as blue metal.  This received some support from the
report of Mr Max Thompson,
a former motorcycle racer and an instructor in
motorcycle riding techniques, who observed that a road surface "covered with
blue
metal is a high risk area whilst cornering."
<P>

6	The car which the plaintiff overtook was driven by Ms Belinda van Zyp and Ms
Penny Giblin was a passenger in that vehicle.  Neither
was called as a witness
but each of them made brief statements to a police officer investigating the
accident, which he recorded
in his police notebook.  Ms van Zyp said that the
motorcycle overtook her car "very fast".  She saw the rider "put the brakes on"
at the Bowmans Road corner, but the bike "started to skid out sideways, off the
road and then there was just a cloud of dust".  Ms
Giblin described the bike as
"flying past" the car.  She said that at the Bowmans Road corner the bike "kept
going straight ahead,
and I saw all the dust as he went off the road."
<P>

7	According to an ambulance report, officers who attended the scene found the
plaintiff lying by the side of the roadway.  The casualty
record at Blacktown
Hospital notes that, when he was first examined there, he could not remember
what had happened.  The same document
records a "history from ambulance" to the
effect that the plaintiff had missed a curve and gone off the road.  Whether
that history
emanated from the plaintiff himself is very unclear, and I do not
consider it to be of any evidentiary significance.  On the other
hand, it may
be that he gave an account consistent with his evidence to Dr Atish Sengupta
who, according to the hospital records,
assisted when he underwent surgery that
same day.  He consulted Dr Sengupta in May 1988 for advice about his future
treatment, and
that doctor provided a report to his solicitors on 22 March
1993.  The account of the accident in that report is that the plaintiff
"took a
corner and lost control because of excessive gravel on the road".  I am asked
to infer that that is the history he gave the
doctor while at the hospital. 
<P>

8	However, on 30 March 1987 (about ten days after the accident) the plaintiff
made a statement at the hospital to the investigating
police officer, Constable
Andrew Passmore.  Having described the course of his journey to Vardy's Road he
said:
<P>

	The next thing I can remember is travelling down Vardy's Road, towards
Marayong, I overtook a car and that's about all I can remember.
<P>

The statement is silent about the speed at which he was travelling and it seems
that the Constable did not ask him.  From the defendant's
point of view, the
significant omission is any reference to "blue metal" on the surface of the
road.
<P>

9	Constable Passmore examined the scene of the accident about an hour after it
had occurred.  He saw the plaintiff's motor cycle
on the ground where it had
come to rest.  He observed a lengthy skid mark, which he measured approximately
by pacing it out.  It
commenced six metres east of Turbo Road and continued
more or less in a straight line for 22 metres across the tarred surface and
for
a further sixteen metres across dirt at the side of the road, until it ended at
a ditch.  The bike was about ten metres beyond
that ditch.  The length of the
skid mark led him to believe that speed was a factor in the accident.  
<P>

10	Constable Passmore did not notice any loose material on the roadway in the
area which he examined.  He gave evidence that he
would have recorded anything
he saw which he considered might have contributed to the accident, and that he
was aware of the possible
significance of such material on the road surface in
a motor cycle accident. 
<P>

	<b>The road works</b>
<P>

11	During 1987 the council was engaged in widening Vardy's Road to the east of
Turbo Road, so as to create two lanes of traffic
in each direction, and
extending Vardy's Road to the west of Turbo Road towards an underpass at the
railway line just north of Marayong
Station.  There was conflicting evidence
about how far that work had progressed at the time of the accident.
<P>

12	The evidence of the plaintiff, who then travelled on that stretch of roadway
regularly, was that the work was virtually complete.
 He said that "they had
just finished tarring" the section of Vardy's Road to the west of Turbo Road,
and barriers had been in place
for a few days to stop traffic proceeding onto
that part of the road.  He said that the widening and sealing of the section of
Vardy's
Road to the east of Turbo Road had been completed, although he could
not say how long that was before the accident.
<P>

13	On the other hand, Constable Passmore's recollection was that the work was
at a much earlier stage.  He said that construction
work was going on to the
west of Turbo Road, although not in the immediate vicinity of the intersection,
which he described as "just
clear ground".  He agreed that there were barriers
of some kind, made either of timber or para-webbing, blocking access to that
section
of Vardy's Road. According to him, however, all that had been done to
the east of Turbo Road was some clearing for the purpose of
widening the road,
and Vardy's Road there was still only one lane in either direction.  He left
Blacktown police station in June
1987, some three months after the accident,
and his recollection was that the road work had still not been completed.
<P>

14	Mr Gregory Morgan, director of the defendant's Technical and Transport
Services, gave evidence.  In 1987 he was the defendant's
construction engineer
and he became involved in the road works in January of that year.  At that
stage, he said, clearing of land
which the defendant had acquired had commenced
for the purpose of widening the section of Vardy's Road to the east of Turbo
Road.
 The western section was being excavated and sandstone being laid.  An
entry in a diary kept by the defendant for 18 March, the day
before the
accident, confirms that excavation on the western side, near the Bowmans Road
intersection, was taking place that day.
 An entry for the day of the accident
states that excavation continued and sandstone was laid, presumably in that
same area.  Mr
Morgan said that the western section of road was tarred around
the middle of 1987, and the eastern section later than that.  He identified
a
return sheet for the delivery of asphalt in July 1987, which he believed was
the first delivery to the site and was used for tarring
the western section of
the road.
<P>

15	The effect of Mr Morgan's evidence is that none of the work being undertaken
at the time of the accident was such as could have
caused loose material to be
deposited on the roadway, as the plaintiff alleged.  The sandstone was
delivered by truck but he said
that it was the practice for it to be deposited
and laid immediately, rather than being stockpiled.  That being so, the
sandstone
laid on the day of the accident would have been delivered during the
course of that day, some hours after the accident occurred.
 On the southern
side of Vardy's Road, east of Turbo Road, a wall was being constructed to mark
the intended new boundary of the
road, and this entailed the delivery of shale
by truck to the site. However, Mr Morgan explained that this work was being
carried
on some distance from the existing roadway and, in particular, from the
Bowmans Road intersection.  He added that the trucks delivering
the shale would
not have crossed that intersection, because they approached the site from the
east and left it the way they had come.

<P>

	<b>Liability</b>
<P>

16	Some evidence was led bearing on the plaintiff's credibility.  He has a
criminal record, most of it now fairly old, for offences
of dishonesty and
driving offences.  He was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident
(although, happily, he did not sustain
any significant head injury).  In
evidence he explained that the helmet had been stolen from where the bike had
been parked earlier
that night.  He added that maybe he should not have ridden
the bike for that reason.  However, he told Dr Edward Schutz, consultant
surgeon, who examined him in 1997 on behalf of the defendant, that he had the
helmet on the side of the bike but was "too lazy" to
wear it.  In
cross-examination, he said that he had given Dr Schutz that account because he
feared that what he told the doctor might
be reported to police, and he did not
wish it to be known that in fact he did not have the helmet at all.
<P>

17	That said, the plaintiff appeared to me to be an honest, unsophisticated
witness.  Indeed, when addressing on the central issue
of whether there was
loose material on the road, counsel for the defendant did not suggest
otherwise.  The plaintiff said that the
first time he had been to the scene of
the accident since it occurred was about two years later. By then, of course,
the road work
had been completed.  Counsel for the defendant suggested that,
influenced by what he saw on that occasion, the plaintiff had unconsciously
reconstructed in his mind the state of the road work at the time of the
accident. As I understand it, the argument was that his image
of the road
having recently been sealed led to a mistaken belief that there had been loose
blue metal on the surface.
<P>

18	I am satisfied that the roadway in the area had not been tarred at the time
of the accident, and that the road works generally
had not progressed to
anything like the point described by the plaintiff in his evidence.  On that
question, I accept the evidence
of Mr Morgan.  
<P>

19	I am mindful of the fact that the plaintiff had no memory of what occurred
when he was admitted to Blacktown Hospital and that,
some ten days later, his
account to Constable Passmore of what he could remember did not include any
reference to loose material
on the road.  His lack of memory on his admission
does not particularly concern me, but his description of the accident to
Constable
Passmore is more significant.  On the other hand, as will be seen, he
was seriously injured in the accident, he had undergone surgery
and was still
in hospital at the time.  When he spoke to the Constable, he said, he was "a
mess".  The history he gave Dr Sengupta,
consistent with his evidence, is in
his favour.  Dr Sengupta was not called and it is unclear when that history was
provided.  However,
if it was given at some later time and was significantly
different from any account he had given at the hospital, one would have
expected the doctor's report to say as much.  It does not.  
<P>

20	Of course, the fact that Constable Passmore did not notice any loose
material on the roadway when he attended the scene is also
significant,
particularly in the light of his evidence that he would have recorded his
observation of anything that might have contributed
to the accident.
Nevertheless, there is some force in the submission of counsel for the
plaintiff that he might not have appreciated
the significance of material of
that kind, given that its relevance would not have been obvious from anything
which he might then
have been told about the accident.  I have given the whole
of the evidence careful scrutiny, and I am satisfied on the balance of
probabilities that there was some such material on that part of the roadway at
the relevant time.
<P>

21	I believe that the plaintiff's recollection of loose material of some
description is genuine.  I cannot accept the argument of
counsel for the
defendant that it is an illusory memory, born of his subsequent observation of
the completed road work.  I have earlier
referred to the entry in the
defendant's diary (exhibit E1) for 18 March 1987, the day before the accident,
that excavation to the
west of the Turbo Road/Bowmans Road intersection was
being carried on that day.  The location of that work can be ascertained more
precisely by reference to a plan of the proposed road works (exhibit 7), and it
appears to have been close to the Bowmans Road intersection.
 It could be that
that process itself produced some debris which an untrained observer might
describe as "blue metal" or "gravel".
 However that may be, Mr Morgan explained
that the laying of sandstone for the western section of the roadway had already
commenced
at that time.  Trucks delivering the sandstone, he said, were likely
to have approached the site from Bowmans Road.  He said that
spillage of
material from the trucks was very unlikely because they were covered and, in
any event, the moisture content of the material
kept it compacted.
<P>

22	On this aspect, Mr Morgan was giving evidence of the usual procedures
adopted in the course of the construction.  Although he
attended the site very
regularly, he acknowledged that he had no recollection of 18 March in
particular.  I have referred to the
possibility that debris from the process of
excavation was scattered on the roadway.  There is also the possibility of
shale being
spilt from trucks delivering that material to the site on the
eastern side of Turbo Road although, in the light of Mr Morgan's evidence,
I
think it is remote.  It is more likely that sandstone was spilt from trucks
approaching the western site.  This must have been
a real possibility,
notwithstanding Mr Morgan's evidence that it should rarely occur. (The question
whether sandstone might have
been scattered in the course of being laid was not
explored in evidence.)  It is significant that the plaintiff appears to have
used
the expression "gravel" in his history to Dr Sengupta (and to other
doctors).  Although imprecise, that is the expression which many
people would
use to describe the sandstone.
<P>

23	It is clear that the defendant was the only organisation carrying on
construction work in the area at the relevant time.  Accordingly,
I am
satisfied that the defendant is responsible for the deposit of loose material
on the roadway.  It should have been cleared away
or, at least, there should
have been a warning of its presence.  Equally, I am satisfied that that
material was the major factor
causing the plaintiff to lose control of his
motorcycle.  
<P>

24	However, it was not the only factor.  I am also satisfied that the plaintiff
was riding too fast in the circumstances, having
overtaken the car in which Ms
van Zyp and Ms Giblin were travelling.  Their descriptions of the bike's speed
must be treated with
some caution, as neither was able to be tested in oral
evidence.  However, their impression that the bike was travelling very fast
is
confirmed, at least to some extent, by the lengthy skid mark which Constable
Passmore observed.  I accept that the skid must be
due in part to the loss of
traction caused by the material on the roadway.  Nevertheless, given that the
skid mark commenced some
metres east of the Turbo Road intersection, I think it
more likely than not that the plaintiff had to brake heavily in anticipation
of
his turning into Bowmans Road.  It is probable that at that point he was
travelling faster than the estimate he gave in evidence.
 For that reason I am
unmoved by the observation in the report of Mr Thomspon, the motorcycle
instructor, about a safe speed for
a cycle at that intersection.  I would, in
any event, place little weight on that evidence.
<P>

25	Accordingly, I am satisfied that the accident was the result of the
defendant's negligence but that there was contributory negligence
on the part
of the plaintiff.  In the light of that contributory negligence, I consider it
just and equitable to reduce the damages
he might otherwise recover by 25 per
cent. 
<P>

	<b>Damages</b>
<P>

26	The plaintiff, born on 30 September 1958, was aged twenty-eight when the
accident occurred and is now forty.  At the time of
the accident he was married
and had an infant son, although he was separated from his wife.  After the
accident there was a period
of reconciliation with his wife and she gave birth
to another son.  However, in circumstances which I shall describe, the
relationship
came to an end permanently.  At the time of the trial he was
living with a de facto partner.
<P>

27	He left school before he turned fifteen without gaining his School
Certificate.  He undertook a motor maintenance course, but
thereafter he worked
mainly in labouring jobs.  These were interspersed with periods of
unemployment: usually of a few months, the
longest being twelve months.  At the
time of the accident he had been working for about a month at Comalco Aluminium
Ltd as a storeman
and packer.  He had enjoyed good health. 
<P>

28	On admission to hospital after the accident, the plaintiff was found to have
a compound fracture/dislocation of the right wrist,
a right brachial plexus
injury, pneumothorax and fractured rib on the right side, laceration of the
liver and multiple other lacerations
which need not be further described.
Surgery involved open reduction and internal fixation of the wrist and
treatment of the pneumothorax
and liver laceration.  The other lacerations were
sutured.  He was discharged about a fortnight later, on 31 March 1987.
<P>

29	The most serious and enduring result of the accident arises from the right
brachial plexus injury.  The plaintiff was left with
a flail, functionless
right arm.  Neurological investigation revealed that there had been a complete
nerve root avulsion, and the
chance of recovery of the use of the arm was very
poor. He could not move his arm, and it was either in a sling or hanging beside
him.  He found it frustrating and he consulted specialists about having it
amputated.  An above elbow amputation was performed at
Lidcombe Hospital in
December 1988.  
<P>

30	Despite some resistance on his part, the plaintiff was later supplied with a
prosthesis.  However, he found it to be of no use
and, as he put it in
evidence, "it finished up in the cupboard".  This is consistent with the view
of Dr Peter Kendall, consultant
physician, who was engaged by the plaintiff's
solicitors for medico-legal purposes.  In a report of 22 August 1996, the
doctor said
of the plaintiff:
<P>

	He has suffered a 100% loss of his right arm and I do not think, even with
increased experience and use, his prosthesis will be
of any benefit to him
except from a cosmetic point of view and that will be outweighed by the need to
carry a cumbersome contraption
strapped to his trunk and other shoulder.
<P>

31	It is obvious that the plaintiff is no malingerer, a matter which enhances
my assessment of his credibility generally.  Dr Kendall
was "most impressed
with his attitude" and found him a "particularly credible man".  The doctor
described him as "a most remarkable
individual who has overcome tremendous
odds".  Dr James Athanasou, psychologist, who prepared vocational assessments
on behalf of
the defendant, wrote of his presentation as "appropriate to the
situation", observing that "he related to me in a very pleasant manner".
 His
stoicism was evident from the following answers in his evidence in chief:
<P>

	Q. How do you feel about not having an arm?
<P>

	A. Don't feel good about it but I have to live with it.
<P>

	Q. Does it concern you, the fact that when you walk around you don't have an
arm and people look at you?
<P>

	A. It did at first but now I have learned to live with it.
<P>

32	Prior to his arm being amputated he experienced constant pain in the wrist
and elbow.  That sensation continued as phantom pain
after the amputation, the
intensity of it depending on the weather.  In evidence, he said that pain "is
there 24 hours a day, seven
days a week", and that he had "just learned to live
with it".
<P>

33	The loss of the plaintiff's right arm is a most distressing circumstance,
relieved only by the fact that he is left handed. 
The other sequelae of the
accident are much less serious but are, nevertheless, significant.  After his
discharge from Blacktown
Hospital he stayed for eight months with his mother, a
nurse, who cared for him until he was able to manage himself.  It took him
about six months to walk properly again.  It seems that he sustained some
injury to his thoracic spine, and he said in evidence that
he still got "a
little bit of lower back pain".  Dr Kendall was of the view that "over the
years he is bound to get a significant
amount of mid-dorsal backache...".  The
doctor was also of the opinion that he has been left with restrictive lung
disease.  The
plaintiff said that he was prone to the flu, although he kept
this under control by flu injections.
<P>

34	As observed earlier, he attempted reconciliation with his wife in 1988.
This led to the birth of their second son, but three
months later the
relationship broke down.  It would seem that this was contributed to by the
pain resulting from his injuries, together
with his distress at his condition
generally.  He said that on a couple of occasions he "belted up" his wife and
even attacked his
mother, and the police had to be called.  At the time of the
hearing he had been living with his de facto wife for about four years,
and he
described that relationship as stable.
<P>

35	He had been a keen motor-cycle rider.  Since the accident he has had to
content himself with riding as a pillion passenger with
some friends.  He had
enjoyed fishing and, while he continues to fish, he said that it is "a lot
harder" with one arm.  At the time
of the hearing he had been unable to find
work, although he had been doing odd jobs from time to time at a friend's farm.
He said
that that work took him longer because of his condition and he was
under no pressure to complete a task in any particular time. 
Nevertheless, he
enjoyed it and he saw farming as a possible occupation in the future.
Unfortunately, given his major disability
and limited education, I consider his
employment prospects to be fairly bleak.  I shall turn to that question in more
detail in a
moment. 
<P>

	<b>General Damages</b>
<P>

36	The assessment of general damages is purely a common law exercise, as the
accident pre-dates the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Accidents Act</i> 1988</a>.  Taking into account
the nature and extent of his injuries and their continuing effects upon his
personal well-being and lifestyle,
I think that the appropriate figure is
$150,000.  I would attribute one third of that amount to the past, and that
proportion should
attract interest at the usual rate of two per cent.
<P>

	<b>Economic Loss</b>
<P>

37	As a storeman and packer with Comalco Aluminium Ltd, the plaintiff's average
net weekly wage at the time of the accident was
$223.50.  As I have said, he
has had no paid employment since.  Efforts to find a job through an
organisation dealing with employment
for disabled people were unsuccessful.  At
the time of the hearing he had been receiving a disability pension for some
years. 
<P>

38	The plaintiff told Dr Kendall that he would like to set up a small farming
enterprise, and Dr Schutz observed "that he seemed
quite keen on working if he
could find a job".  In his report of August 1996, Dr Kendall concluded that he
"is entirely non competitive
as a potential employee and lacks the intellectual
and emotional capacity to become competitive in a clerical job". The doctor
added
that he considered self employment an option, although the plaintiff
would need to undertake a small business course and would need
assistance with
the administration of funds. Dr Athanasau concluded that the plaintiff "had the
potential to continue in the work
force at an unskilled level".  He listed some
occupations, such as street vendor, service station attendant, or caretaker, of
which
he might be capable.  However, he cautioned that the plaintiff's
employment prospects are "reduced by his prolonged absence from
the work
force", adding that he "would now be at significant risk of very long-term
unemployment".  
<P>

39	There is no evidence of the current wage of a comparable employee at
Comalco.  I was supplied with the Australian Bureau of Statistics
figures for
average weekly earnings for the period from 1987 to 1997.  Increases in the
average wage over that period suggest that
at the time of the hearing the
plaintiff's pre-accident wage would roughly have doubled: a figure of, say,
$450.00 per week.  Given
his physical and educational limitations, I am by no
means optimistic about his prospects of employment, including establishing a
business of his own. Nevertheless, on the evidence as a whole, I am bound to
find that there is some residual work capacity.  The
practical approach to this
matter suggested from the Bar table commends itself to me.  That residual
capacity would be recognised
by allowing $300.00 per week for past wage loss
over the whole period since the accident, and the same figure for future wage
loss.

<P>

40	Future wage loss should be assessed by the application of the three per cent
tables.  The amount for past wage loss should attract
interest at seven per
cent.  Counsel for the defendant submitted that a larger than usual deduction
should be made for vicissitudes,
given the plaintiff's somewhat chequered
pre-accident work history.  However, in all the circumstances, I think that the
usual rate
of 15 per cent is appropriate.  Of course, Social Security payments
will have to be deducted.
<P>

	<b>Short Minutes</b>
<P>

41	Of course, the total amount of damages must be reduced by 25 per cent to
reflect the plaintiff's  contributory negligence.  I
request the parties to
bring in short minutes to give effect to my reasons and, if necessary, I shall
hear argument on costs.  On
the question of damages generally, counsel should
not hesitate to inform me if I have made any technical or procedural error or
have
failed to deal with any relevant matter.
