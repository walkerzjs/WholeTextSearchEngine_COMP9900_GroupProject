<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  The plaintiff by notice of motion filed 29 June
1999 seeks an order that the time within which to commence proceedings be
extended
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60c.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60C</a> and E of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a> </b>1969 (NSW) (as
amended) (the Act) as against the second to thirteenth defendants and s 151D of
the <b>Workers Compensation Act</b> (NSW) as against the first defendant.  The
plaintiff relied on his affidavit sworn 28 June 1999.  The defendants relied on
the affidavit
of Richard Mark Pegg sworn 10 August 1999.  The thirteenth
defendant did not appear.
<P>

2  	The plaintiff's counsel submitted that in the pleadings
paragraphs 6 to 11 of the statement of claim inclusive do not need an
extension
of time.  The pleadings in paragraphs 6 to 8 refer to a breach of contract.
The damages are those which have arisen from
the breach or breaches of
contract.  Paragraph 9 refers to a conspiracy and paragraph 10 to
intimidation.
<P>

3  	If an extension of time is required for paragraphs 6 to 11 of the
statement of claim the application for same is stood over
to be determined at
the trial.  The circumstances in which the plaintiff entered into the deed of
agreement dated 15 July 1994 may
need to be canvassed.
<P>

4  	The first defendant, Club Marconi was the employer of the
plaintiff.  It is alleged that at all material times the second to
thirteenth
defendants were directors, servants and agents of the first defendant.  By
paragraph 14 of the statement of claim, it
is alleged that in about November
1993 the plaintiff received a death threat as a result of him exercising his
professional, contractual
and lawful obligations pursuant to the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rca1976173/" class="autolink_findacts">Registered
Clubs Act</a></b> 1976.  It is also alleged that the plaintiff received numerous
verbal threats of dismissal by the defendants.  He claims he suffered
personal
injury and claims damages for loss of opportunity, mental distress and loss of
income,  career advancement and prospects.
 He also claims exemplary
damages.
<P>

5  	For the purposes of this application I find the following facts.
In arriving at these findings I observed the plaintiff both
giving evidence and
being cross examined and I formed the opinion that he was a truthful and
intelligent witness.
<P>

(1)	In about November 1990 the plaintiff commenced employment with the first
defendant as joint general manager.  In February 1991
he took over as general
manager.
<P>

(2)	In November 1993 the plaintiff was attending a building meeting, on behalf
of the first defendant, when he suffered chest pains.
 He went to hospital.  He
had a few days off work and claimed workers compensation for that period.
<P>

(3)	In December 1993/January 1994 the plaintiff was subpoenaed and gave
evidence to the Liquor Administration Board in relation
to activities involving
the first defendant.
<P>

(4)	During the course of the plaintiff's employment he was subjected to various
threats, harassment, intimidation and his directions
were countermanded by the
first defendant and he was directed not to co-operate with the Liquor
Administration Board in their investigation
into the affairs of the first
defendant.  As a result of this the plaintiff feared for his personal
safety.
<P>

(5)	During early 1994 the assistant manager employed by the first defendant,
Wayne Forrest was assaulted in the car park of the
premises of the first
defendant.  Shortly after this assault the plaintiff received a telephone call
from an unidentified person
who said to him during the course of the
conversation words to the effect "Take what happened to Forrest as a warning
and don't rock
the boat.  It could be unhealthy, keep your mouth shut, and give
the Liquor people nothing".
<P>

(6)	Also during early 1994, a club member by the name of Genovisi Quattrone
approached the plaintiff outside the foyer of the first
defendant's premises
and said to him words to the effect "We like you Peter, we don't like anything
to happen to you.  Be careful
what you say to the Liquor Administration Board."
As those words were said Mr Quattrone displayed a pistol which he had tucked
into
his belt which was covered by a stretchy polo neck shirt.  Mr Quattrone
allegedly put his left arm under his shirt and on the pistol.
 The plaintiff
reported the threat to detectives at Central Police Station.  The plaintiff, at
the time of making the complaint,
was unwilling to identify the maker of the
threats as he knew him to be a close friend of the second defendant and other
members
of the board.  
<P>

(7)	Because of the threats the plaintiff feared for his family's safety.  He
moved his wife to a country town where their son was
in boarding school.  He
took precautions for his own safety.
<P>

(8)	In May 1994 the plaintiff suffered a nervous breakdown.  He has never fully
recovered but started to get his self confidence
back later in 1994.  The
plaintiff consulted Dr Freed a psychiatrist on 17 June 1994 and has been
consulting him on an average of
once per month from that date to the present
time.  On 20 July 1995 Dr Freed furnished a report.  He diagnosed that the
plaintiff
suffered from a major depression as well as an anxiety disorder with
episodes of panic.  He opined that these conditions arose directly
out of the
tensions which the plaintiff experience at the club, as well as the court case
which ensued against members of the club
board.  He said that the plaintiff's
symptoms would persist while court proceedings continued and or his income
remained less than
it was with the first defendant.
<P>

(9)	On 15 July 1994 the plaintiff entered into a deed with the first defendant
in relation to his resignation. He knew that he had
legal rights but he felt
that he was not able to deal with them.  He was able to give his solicitors
instructions concerning the
circumstances surrounding the dispute with his
employer.  Paragraph 6 of the deed states that the plaintiff releases and
forever
discharges the club from all manner of damages, claims, actions, suits,
causes of action, proceedings, demands, costs and expenses
both at law or in
equity or arising under any statute (excluding the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act
1987</a>) arising from or are connected in any way with his employment as Chief
Executive officer.
<P>

(10)	In about July 1994 the plaintiff commenced employment at Penrith Leagues
Club in the motel.  On 15 October 1994 he was promoted
to a job as co-ordinator
of the catering team.
<P>

(11)	In 1995 the plaintiff gave evidence to a Senate Inquiry in relation to the
transfer of a soccer player Paul Okon from Marconi
Club (the first defendant)
to Club Brussels in Brugge.  
<P>

(12)	In May 1995 the plaintiff consulted Holman Webb solicitors about an
article published about him in the "Marconi News".  He
had one consultation
with a solicitor which lasted between 10 to 30 minutes in which he requested
that an apology be sought.  He
forwarded transcripts of proceedings before
Licensing Magistrate Keating to the solicitor.  On 25 May 1995 the plaintiff's
solicitor
forwarded a letter to the editor of "Marconi News" and a copy to the
plaintiff.  The plaintiff agreed with the contents of the letter.
<P>

(13)	In 1995 the plaintiff gave evidence before the Stewart Inquiry. 
<P>

(14)	Prior to giving evidence at court inquiries or tribunals the plaintiff was
involved in interviews and preparing statements
of his evidence.  A short time
prior to being required to give evidence in court proceedings the plaintiff
would consult with his
psychiatrist who would increase his dose of medication.
The plaintiff would become depressed, tense, anxious and mentally drained
and
lose sleep. 
<P>

(15)	At the end of 1995 the plaintiff obtained employment with the Building
Workers Club at Durrock as a secretary manager.  This
job lasted three
months.
<P>

(16)	From February 1996 to October 1997 the plaintiff was employed as secretary
manager of the Tattersalls Club.  The job was a
responsible, demanding one and
he performed well for the first nine months.
<P>

(17)	In late 1996/1997 the plaintiff realised he would never be capable of
having a career as a manager.
<P>

(18)	In 1997 the plaintiff gave evidence before the Liquor Administration Board
in relation to activities involving the first defendant.
<P>

(19)	From 26 January 1998 the plaintiff was employed at Ramsgate RSL as a
secretary manager.  He is currently employed.  He has
been employed in lesser
positions in smaller clubs since he left the Marconi Club.
<P>

(20)	The plaintiff gave evidence that he was incapable of taking these legal
proceedings until the end of 1996.  He did not seek
legal advice until the end
of 1996 because of the effects it had on his health.  Every time that he is
required to discuss this matter
he becomes fearful and suffers from anxiety
attacks.
<P>

(21)	On 9 July 1997 the statement of claim was filed.
<P>

(22)	On 29 June 1999 the notice of motion was filed seeking an extension of the
limitation period.
<P>

<P>

6  	I turn now to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 52</a> says:
<P>

<b>"Disability, confirmation, fraud and mistake</b>

<b>52(1)	Subject to subsections (2) and (3) and subject to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 53</a>,

<P>

<b>	in that case:</b>

<b>(d)	The running of the limitation period is suspended for the duration of

<b>(e)	if, but for this paragraph, the limitation period would expire before

<P>

<b>(ii)	the date of his death,</b>

<P>

<b>(2)	This section applies whenever a person is under a disability, whether or
not he is under the same or another disability at any

<P>

7  	"Disability" is defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 11(3)(b).</a>  It says:

<P>

<b>(b)	while he is, for a continuous period of twenty-eight days or upwards,

the question arises, by reason of:</b>
<P>

<b>(i)	any disease or any impairment of his physical or mental
condition;</b>
<P>

<b>..."</b>
<P>

8  	According to Kirby P in <b><u>State Rail Authority v
Hammond</u></b> (1988) 15 NSWLR 395, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> evolved from the 1926 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a>
which allowed those of non compos mentis (of unsound mind) to bring actions
when they are of sane memory.  
<P>

9  	<b>Lord Denning</b> when dealing with the words "unsound mind" in
<b><u>Kirby v Leather</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%202%20QB%20367" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965] 2 QB 367</a> at 383 said:
<P>

<b>"So here it seems to me in this statute a person is `of unsound mind' when
he is, by reason of mental illness, incapable of managing
his affairs in
relation to the accident as a reasonable man would do."</b>
<P>

10  	In <b><u>Pointon v Walkley</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281951%29%20SASR%20121" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1951) SASR 121</a> Mayo J said
that it may be accepted that `Unsound' is the antithesis of `sound'.  `Sound',
when used in connection with body or mind,
denotes the presence of perfect
health or, putting it in another way, the absence of all defects other than
those that are trivial.
 A sound person is one without the sign of disease,
malady or unhealthy abnormality.
<P>

11  	The plaintiff's submission is that between May 1994 and up until
late 1996 early 1997 he was under a disability and for that
period the running
of time should be suspended.  The plaintiff gave evidence that he was not able
to deal with his claim until late
1996/97 because of the effects it had on his
health.  Every time that he is required to discuss this matter he becomes
fearful and
suffers from anxiety attacks.  However, the plaintiff was able to
instruct solicitors in 1995 in relation to "Marconi News" and has,
to his
credit been in almost continual employment since August 1994.  In 1994/95 the
plaintiff was able to give evidence about some
of the events which are relevant
to this cause of action.  There is no medical evidence to support the
plaintiff's account that he
was incapable of taking these proceedings or
substantially impeded in the management of his affairs in relation to the cause
of action.
 It may be that he was capable of consulting a solicitor and taking
proceedings but he put it off because he anticipated that it
would be
unpleasant and would cause an anxiety attack.  The plaintiff bears the onus of
establishing that he falls within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 18(3)</a> and he has failed to discharge that
onus.  I am not satisfied that the plaintiff by reason of his psychiatric state
was incapable
or substantially impeded in the management of his affairs in
relation to this cause of action.  The claim under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> fails.
<P>

<P>

12  	The plaintiff relies on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60c.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 60C</a> and E of the Act in relation to

and E fall within subdivision 2 of the Act which is defined as the secondary
limitation period.  Subdivision 2 applies only to causes

<P>

<b>"Ordinary action (including surviving action)</b>
<P>

<b>60C(1)This section applies to a cause of action, founded on negligence,
nuisance or breach of duty, for damages for personal injury,
but does not apply

<P>

<b>(2)	If an application is made to a court by a person claiming to have a

reasonable to do so, order that the limitation
period for the cause of action be extended for such period, not exceeding 5
years,
as it determines."</b>
<P>

13  	Section 60E provides:
<P>

<b>"Matters to be considered by the court</b>
<P>

<b>60E(1)In exercising the powers conferred on it by section 60C or 60D, a
court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case,
and (without
affecting the generality of the foregoing), the court is, to the extent that
they are relevant to the circumstances
of the case, to have regard to the
following:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the length of and reasons for the delay;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	the extent to which, having regard to the delay, there is or may be
prejudice to the defendant by reason that evidence that would
have been
available if the proceedings had been commenced within the limitation period is
no longer available;</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	the time at which the injury became known to the plaintiff;</b>
<P>

<b>(d)	the time at which the nature and extent of the injury became known to
the plaintiff;</b>

<b>(e)	the time at which the plaintiff became aware of a connection between the
injury and the defendant's act or omission;  </b>
<P>

<b>(f)	any conduct of the defendant which induced the plaintiff to delay

<P>

<b>(g)	the steps (if any) taken by the plaintiff to obtain medical, legal or

<P>

<b>(h)	the extent of the plaintiff's injury or loss."</b>
<P>

14  	In relation to ss 60C and 60E of the Act Mason P in <b><u>The
Council of City of Sydney v Zegarac</u></b> (NSWCA unreported, 26 February
1998) referred to propositions which were uncontroversial.  They are: 
<P>

(1)	Section 60C confers a judicial discretion.  
<P>

(2)	The discretion is a discretion to grant, not a discretion to refuse, an
extension of the primary limitation period.  The court
must be satisfied that
it is "just and reasonable" to make the order for extension.  
<P>

(3)	In exercising the discretion, the court is required "to have regard to all
the circumstances of the case" (s 60E(1)).  It is
also required to have regard
to the 8 factors listed in s 60E(1) "to the extent that they are relevant to
the circumstances of the
case".  
<P>

(4)	Among those circumstances to which a court must have regard are the
rationales for the existence of limitation periods which
were identified in
those passages from the Attorney General's second reading speech that are set
out in the order judgments, and
which McHugh J discusses in <b><u>Brisbane
South Regional Health Authority v Taylor</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186 CLR 541</a>;  139
ALR.
<P>

(5)	Since s 60C creates a judicial discretion appellate review is restricted by
well known principles.  Mason P then says that beyond
this there are more
debatable areas of application of <b><u>Taylor</u></b>.
<P>

15  	Justice Powell in <b><u>Zegarac</u></b> stated that three things
may be said about s 60C and s 60E.  He agreed with proposition 3 expounded by
Mason P.  Powell JA's further
two propositions were firstly, that an order
extending the limitation period may only be made when it appears, in the light
of all
the circumstances of the case, including those set out in s 60E(1) of
the Act, that it is just and reasonable so to do;  and secondly
although a
prospective defendant may be subject to an evidentiary onus to raise any
consideration telling against the exercise of
the discretion to extend the
limitation period, the ultimate onus of satisfying the court that, in all the
circumstances of the case,
it is just and reasonable that an order may be made
lies on the applicant.
<P>

16  	The cause of action accrued on 27 May 1994.  The limitation
period expired on 27 May 1997.  The statement of claim was filed
on 9 July 1997
just over two months out of time.  The application seeking the extension of
time was filed on 29 June 1999 about two
years later.  However, the case has
been subject to case management court directions which involved appearances
before the court
by the parties' legal representatives since 22 October 1997.
The plaintiff's reason for delay is, that due to his psychiatric condition
he
was incapable of bringing legal proceedings until the end of 1996.  In late
1996 he consulted a solicitor and proceedings were
commenced just over six
months later.  There is no explanation for that six month delay nor the two
year delay in filing the application
to extend time.  However, the defendants
have been aware of the proceedings shortly after the limitation period
expired.
<P>

17  	In relation to s 60E(b) none of the defendants demonstrated that
they had lost evidence that would have been available had
the action been
commenced within the limitation period.  I will refer to delay generally later
in this judgment.
<P>

18  	Shortly after 24 May 1994 the plaintiff was aware that he had
suffered an injury and the connection between the injury and
the defendants'
acts (s 60E(c) and (e)).  It was in 1996 that the plaintiff became aware that
he would no longer have a career as
a capable manager.  In other words, he
realised that he would never be able to reattain the position of a manager of a
large club
such as that of the first defendant (s 60E(d)).
<P>

19  	As previously stated, for the purposes of this application, I
have accepted the plaintiff's evidence but it is acknowledged
that it will be
disputed at trial.  In January 1994 (before the limitation period expired) the
plaintiff's evidence is that he was
threatened by anonymous threats, his
assistant manager was assaulted on the first defendant's premises and the
plaintiff received
a telephone call saying "Take what happened to Forrest as a
warning and don't rock the boat.  It could be unhealthy, keep your mouth
shut
and give the Liquor Board nothing".  Another threat was made when a club member
produced a gun and told the plaintiff to be
careful what he said to the Liquor
Administration Board.  The plaintiff moved his wife to the country and took
precautions for his
personal safety.  Despite the threats, the plaintiff
fulfilled his duty and gave evidence at the Liquor Administration Board inquiry
and other courts and tribunals.  It was only in 1996 that he began to feel less
fearful of the threats to his life.  The first defendant's
counsel submitted
that this behaviour cannot be linked because the threat was anonymous.
However, the assault on Mr Forrest occurred
on the first defendant's premises
and the threats were linked to an investigation into the first defendant.  If
the behaviour referred
to earlier is linked to the first defendant and its
directors it is very serious indeed.  Those actions brought about a delay in
the plaintiff taking proceedings until 1996 (s 60E(f)).
<P>

20  	The plaintiff has obtained a psychiatrist's report in 1995 and
this gives very detailed information on the plaintiff's psychiatric
state from
17 June 1994 to 2 June 1995.  The plaintiff has been seeing Dr Freed on an
average of once per month since 17 June 1994.
 A further report covering the
period from 2 June 1995 to date or the doctors records can be subpoenaed (s
60E(g)).  It seems the
plaintiff will require regular psychiatric consultations
and medication in the future.  The plaintiff's left hand continues to shake.
Although the plaintiff is working and has been in continual employment since
August 1994, his career prospects have diminished (s
60E(d), (g), and (h)).
<P>

21  	I turn to consider whether the plaintiff has a real case to
advance. The applicant bears an evidentiary and persuasive onus
which, in the
absence of concession, requires material to be adduced which demonstrates that
the dilatory plaintiff has a real case
to advance.  The need for the court to
decide that it is just and reasonable to extend the limitation period must
focus attention
on the question whether there is indeed evidence to establish
the plaintiff's cause of action.  It would rarely be possible to say
that it
was just and reasonable to subject the defendant to litigation otherwise
statute barred if it did not appear that there was
evidence available to the
plaintiff to establish his cause of action.  (See <b><u>Szerdahelyi v
Bailey</u></b> (NSWSC unreported Badgery-Parker J, 1 May 1997);  <b><u>Ortado v
Bailey</u></b> (NSWSC unreported, Badgery-Parker J, 1 May 1997);  <b><u>Lewis v
Bailey</u></b> (NSWSC unreported, Badgery-Parker J, 1 May 1997);
<b><u>Zegarac</u></b> and <b><u>Dow Corning Australia Pty Ltd v Paton</u></b>,
<b><u>Meares v Paton</u></b> (NSWCA unreported, 24 April 1998) and
<b><u>Fitzgerald v Bankstown City Council</u></b> (NSWCA unreported, 6 November
1995).
<P>

22  	The second to twelfth defendants submitted that there is no
cause of action against them.  According to the second to twelfth
defendants
the first defendant as employer is vicariously liable for the personal injuries
suffered by the plaintiff.  If it is established
at trial that the second to
thirteenth defendants were acting outside their duties as directors, they may
still be said to have owed
a duty of care to the plaintiff and breached that
duty by causing the plaintiff's injuries.  There is medical evidence to support
the plaintiff's claim that he has suffered major depression and an anxiety
disorder.  There is evidence to support the plaintiff's
proposition that his
career prospects have been diminished as a result of his psychiatric condition
which was caused by the actions
of the defendants.  It is my view that the
plaintiff has a real case to advance.
<P>

23  	I turn to consider delay generally.  I accept that with the
passing of time, there will be presumptive prejudice.  A club member
may be
subpoenaed to give evidence of conversations that allegedly took place five
years ago. I accept that he may have difficulty
recalling the actual words that
were used.  But as a gun was allegedly produced during this conversation, that
may help jog his memory.
 As previously stated, the defendants did not produce
any evidence of actual prejudice.  The plaintiff's general practitioner's
records
from 1991 to 1996 are available.  There is a report from the
plaintiff's treating psychiatrist from 1994 to 1995 and the plaintiff
has
continued to see the psychiatrist each month.  There will be evidence as to the
plaintiff's psychiatric state from when the cause
of action arose to date.  The
first defendant's insurer has been making workers compensation payments for
medical expenses and has
had the plaintiff seen by a psychiatrist three
times.
<P>

24  	It is my view that the defendants have not suffered significant
prejudice nor are their chances of a fair trial unlikely. I
have taken the
matters referred to in s 60E(a)-(h) into account.  The plaintiff has discharged
his onus and I am satisfied that it
is just and reasonable to extend the
limitation period under s 60C and E against the second to thirteenth
defendants.
<P>

25  	In relation to the first defendant, the plaintiff seeks an
extension of the limitation period pursuant to s 151D(2) of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers
Compensation Act</a></b> 1987 (NSW) (as amended).
<P>

26  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151d.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 151D</a> provides:
<P>

<b>"(1)	...</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	A person to whom compensation is payable under this Act is not entitled
to commence court proceedings for damages in respect of
the injury concerned
against the employer liable to pay for compensation more than three years after
the date on which the injury
was received except with the leave of the court in
which the proceedings are to be taken.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	The <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act 1969</a></i> does not apply to or in respect of court
proceedings to which this section applies.</b>
<P>

<b>(4)	..."</b>
<P>

27  	The deed of agreement signed by the plaintiff and first
defendant and dated 15 July 1994 allows the plaintiff to take workers
compensation proceedings.  Any damages awarded against the first defendant will
be assessed pursuant to the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers Compensation Act</a></b>.  The
considerations that are taken into account under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s151d.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 151D(2)</a> are the same as
those I have referred to when I determined the plaintiff's application under s
60C and E of the Act except that I
discount the consideration referred to in s
60E(b).  I also refer to what I have stated previously in relation to delay
generally
and the plaintiff having a real case to advance.  The first defendant
was the plaintiff's employer and the personal injuries are
alleged to have
arisen in the course of his employment.  I am of the view that it is just and
reasonable to extend time and that
leave should be granted to commence
proceedings against the first defendant.  The statement of claim is already on
foot.  The defendants
did not make a submission that the plaintiff should upon
leave being granted, file a further statement of claim.  The requirement
that a
further statement of claim be filed is dispensed with.  Costs are
discretionary.  Costs should be costs in the cause.
<P>

28  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	Leave is granted to extend the limitation period in respect of the causes
of action as pleaded in paragraphs 1 to 5 inclusive
and paragraphs 12 to 20
inclusive of the statement of claim against the second to thirteenth defendants
up to and including 22 December
1999.
<P>

(2)	Leave is granted to commence proceedings against the first defendant in
relation to paragraphs 1 to 5 and paragraphs 12 to 20
inclusive of the
statement of claim up to and including 22 December 1999.
<P>

(3)	The notice of motion to extend the limitation period in relation to
paragraphs 6 to 11 inclusive is stood over until the trial.
<P>

(4)	The requirement to file a further statement of claim is dispensed with.
<P>

(5)	Costs be costs in the cause.
