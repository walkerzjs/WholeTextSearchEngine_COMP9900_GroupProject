<b>50091/1999 - FAULL   v   SUPERANNUATION COMPLAINTS TRIBUNAL</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	The plaintiff, Mr Maxwell John Faull, filed a Summons for
leave to appeal against an Arbitral Award of the Superannuation Complaints
Tribunal, ("the Tribunal"), dated 22 June 1999, pursuant to s.38 of the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Arbitration Act</a></b> 1984 (NSW), ("the Act").
<P>

2   	On 10 August 1999 the Tribunal filed an appearance and, on
17 August 1999, it filed a submitting appearance, submitting to
such order as
the Court may make, save in relation to costs.
<P>

3   	It is necessary to state the facts in a little detail to
understand how the proceedings arise.  The plaintiff was married to
Ms Alison
Faull.  They ceased to cohabit, initially, in about 1985 or 1987 and, finally,
in about 1990, after which they were divorced.
 There was one child of the
marriage, Mr Llewellyn John Faull, ("the deceased"), who was born on 27
February 1976 and died, as a
result of injuries sustained in the course of his
employment, on 16 April 1995.  From the time when Mr and Ms Faull ceased to
live
together, the deceased lived with Ms Faull until his death.  The deceased
had no issue, had not married, and died intestate.
<P>

4   	The deceased had contributed to a superannuation fund and,
at the time of his death, the approximate value of the death benefit
from that
fund was $235,114.73.  Ms Faull applied to Retail Employees Superannuation
Trust, ("REST"), which administers the superannuation
fund, for a payment out
to her of the superannuation death benefit and, on 1 May 1997, the Trustee
wrote to Mr Faull advising that
it proposed to distribute the superannuation
benefit wholly to Ms Faull, and stating that if he agreed with that proposal he
need
take no further action.
<P>

5   	The letter continued:-
<P>

<b>"The benefit will be paid in accordance with this proposal unless REST
receives advice from you, or any other person, claiming to
have an interest in
the distribution of this benefit, that you do not agree with this proposal.
Your advice must be in writing and
REST must receive it within 28 days of this
letter, that is, before 30/5/1997.  Unless REST receives details of your
objection before
this date, you will subsequently be unable to complain about
the payment to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal."</b>
<P>

6   	Solicitors acting for Mr Faull disputed the Trustee's
determination and, by letter dated 28 August 1997, the Trustee affirmed
its
previous decision and advised that if any further complaint was to be made it
should be to the Tribunal.  In due course Mr Faull
complained to the Tribunal,
which issued its Award.
<P>

7   	The Award stated, under the heading "Procedural Matters",
that the Tribunal approached the determination of the matter thus:-
<P>

<b>"The Parties to the Arbitration (the Parties) have requested the
Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (the Tribunal) to arbitrate the
dispute in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the executed Deed of Agreement (the
Agreement) which is retained on the Tribunal
files.</b>
<P>

<b>The matter was originally scheduled for a Review Meeting of the Tribunal on
10 February 1998.  Submissions were invited and received
from all Parties and
responses to those submissions.  The handing down of the Decision of the Full
Federal Court prevented the Review
Meeting from taking place.</b>
<P>

<b>The Tribunal conducted the Arbitration on the papers and had before it all
the documents submitted by the Parties.  The Trustee and
the Complainant chose
to make additional submissions to the Arbitration Meeting and these submissions
were distributed to the other
Parties.  The Complainant and the Trustee
responded in writing to these submissions.  All documents are retained on the
Tribunal
file for record purposes and all documents other than the response
submissions had been copied and distributed to the Parties before
the
Arbitration Meeting."</b>
<P>

8   	The Parties were stated to be Mr Faull, the trustee, and Ms
Faull.  In the present proceedings Ms Faull did not appear, although
I was
informed that she had been made aware of the proceedings and did not wish to be
heard in relation to them.
<P>

<b>The Arbitration Award And The Reasons</b>
<P>

9   	The reasons for the Award, after setting forth most of the
matters to which I have referred, turned to a consideration of the
Trust Deed,
Rule 9.1 of which provided:-
<P>

<b>"If the Member dies the Trustee shall pay or apply the benefits payable in
accordance with this Deed and the Rules to or for the benefit
or (sic) such one
or more Dependants of the deceased Member and the Legal Personal Representative
of the deceased Member and in such
shares and proportions and in such manner as
the Trustee in its discretion determines and without limiting the generality of
the
foregoing the Trustee may utilise the whole or part of the benefit payable
to provide for payment of an annuity (to any one or more
of the Dependants of
the deceased Member) of such nature as the Trustee in its discretion
determines."</b>
<P>

10   	The reasons then set forth the definition of "Dependant"
in Rule 1, namely:-
<P>

<b>"(a)	a spouse of the Member ..</b>
<P>

<b>  (b)	a child of the Member; or</b>
<P>

<b>  (c)	any person who in the opinion of the Trustee is at the relevant date
(or in the case of a deceased Member was at the date of
death of that deceased
Member) wholly or partially dependent financially on that member; or</b>
<P>

<b>  (d)	any person who in the opinion of the Trustee has or had at the
relevant date a legally enforceable right to look to that Member
for financial
support."</b>
<P>

11   	The reasons stated that the Tribunal did not consider that
any part of the definition, other than sub-clause (c), was relevant,
and that
Rule 1 defined "Legal Personal Representative" as "the Executor or
Administrator of the deceased Member's estate".
<P>

12   	The reasons then considered whether there was "a
Dependant".  It was stated that Mr Faull did not claim any financial dependence
upon the deceased, and that the Trustee had submitted that Ms Faull was a
dependant in that, in a statutory declaration she had made
on 13 June 1996, she
stated she was partially dependent upon the deceased at the date of his death.
That partial dependency stemmed
from the fact that the deceased paid her board
of $30 per week.  To this Mr Faull had responded that Ms Faull's stated annual
salary
was $39,411, being $757.90 per week, that the deceased's contribution
was $30 per week, and that:-
<P>

<b>"I fail to see <u>what significant effect</u> this would of (sic) had on my
ex-wife's standard of living <u>and any suggestion of dependency is
ludicrous</u>.  In consequence I cannot accept that (Mother) was either
dependent or reliant on this contribution if it indeed existed and if so
was
any proof presented to the trustee to support such i.e. receipts or taxation
declarations."  (My emphasis.)</b>
<P>

13   	The reasons noted that the Trustee responded that the
payment of $30 per week was enough to make Ms Faull partially financially
dependent on the deceased immediately prior to his death, reliance being placed
on the fact that it was only necessary for there
to be partial financial
dependency.  The Trustee's submission was recorded as being that the level of
dependency was only relevant
where there was more than one person dependent on
the deceased and:-
<P>

<b>"In these circumstances the level of dependency will be used to determine in
what proportions the benefit should be distributed. 
However, where only one
person falls within the definition of `dependant', the level of dependency is
irrelevant - the entire benefit
<u>must</u></b> <b>be paid to him/her."  (My
emphasis.)</b>
<P>

14   	Subsequently in the reasons, the Tribunal considered the
relative needs of Mr and Ms Faull.  It stated:-
<P>

<b>"The Tribunal is in no doubt that the financial circumstances of the Mother
are superior to those of the Father.  Whereas the Father
was unemployed and
existed on a Disability Support Pension, the Mother had regular employment, an
income of about $39,000 for the
year, and was in receipt of a Worker's
Compensation Death Benefit of over $10,000.  The Father described his position
to be in `poor
health' and diagnosed with cancer of the vocal cords.  He states
that he was `part blind had emphysema and also suffering from a
nervous
disorder'.</b>
<P>

<b>If the Tribunal's task was to allocate the Death Benefit according to need,
then the Trustee's decision should be overthrown and replaced
with a decision
that allocated a significant proportion of the benefit to the Complainant.
However, that is not the task of the Tribunal.
 It is merely one consideration
among a number of considerations which the Tribunal considers to be more
important in this particular
case."</b>
<P>

15   	I have taken this passage out of context from the reasons
to show the gross discrepancy between the financial positions of
Mr Faull and
Ms Faull, lest it should be found that that is relevant.
<P>

16   	In the reasons, after setting forth the payments made by
the deceased to Ms Faull of $30 per week to which I have referred,
the Tribunal
stated that partial financial dependence was not defined, and that the Tribunal
had been aware for a long time that
the superannuation industry tended to
interpret the term somewhat generously to facilitate the payment of death
benefits.  The reasons
continued:-
<P>

<b>"The Tribunal in past decisions has tended to follow industry practice in
this regard <u>providing the dependency is real and sufficient to make a real
difference to the person's living standard</u>.  The Tribunal recognises that
though the Mother had a reasonable income and a degree of financial security,
<u>the regular income of $30 per week</u>, probably offset by outgoings for
food, <u>does provide the basis for the provision of more adequate and
comfortable accommodation than may have been accessed by a person living
alone</u>.  The Tribunal therefore accepts that at the point of death the
Mother can be properly described in the terms of the Trust Deed as
a person who
was `partially dependent financially on that Member'.  As such, the Member's
Mother is entitled, under the Trust Deed,
to the status of `dependant'.  There
is no evidence of the existence of any other `dependant' or of a person who had
a legally enforceable
right to look to the Member for financial support."  (My
emphasis.)</b>
<P>

17   	The reasons then turn to a consideration as to whether
there was a legal personal representative, and observed that on 23
December
1997 the Trustee argued that the deceased died intestate and no Letters of
Administration had been granted in respect of
his estate and, accordingly,
there is no legal personal representative to whom any benefit can be paid.  The
reasons considered this
aspect of the matter and, in particular, a submission
put on behalf of Mr Faull that the estate was vested in the Public Trustee
until Letters of Administration were issued.  To this the Trustee responded
that if the Public Trustee was in fact the legal personal
representative
pursuant to the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/sa1981138/" class="autolink_findacts">Succession Act</a></b> 1981 (Qld), and that as such a provision
existed in all States, Mr Faull's argument would lead to the conclusion that
there would
always be a legal personal representative, which would lead to an
interpretation contrary to Regulation 6.22 of the <b>Supervision Act</b>:-
<P>

<b>"Which `clearly contemplates the payment of benefits on death to
non-dependants, where there are no dependants nor a legal personal
representative'."</b>
<P>

It was further argued by the Trustee that the Public Trustee had not consented
"at this point of time" to act as Trustee.
<P>

18   	In these circumstances the Tribunal concluded that the
Trustee was correct that there was no legal personal representative
of the
deceased's estate, but it did not put aside the prospect that the Public
Trustee may be appointed and:-
<P>

<b>"Thus the Tribunal, under the provisions of the Trust Deed, is required to
resolve the dispute by awarding the death benefit to the
Mother, as
`dependant', and/or to the Legal Personal Representative `in such shares and
proportions and in such manner' as in its
discretion it determines."</b>
<P>

19   	The reasons then considered matters for the exercise of
the Trustee's discretion, the first of which was the deceased's wishes.
 He had
made an application for membership less than two months before his death in
which he had nominated Ms Faull as the Preferred
Beneficiary to be paid one
hundred per cent of the benefit in the event of death.  The Tribunal was
satisfied that though the deceased
was only nineteen years old, he was of
sufficient age and maturity to consciously and definitely make such a
decision.
<P>

20   	The Tribunal referred to the fact that the deceased had
applied for the maximum level of insurance and that:-
<P>

<b>"It would be surprising that a young man without a spouse and without
children dependent upon him would take such an option unless
he had some person
clearly in mind at the time."</b>
<P>

The Tribunal was of the view that the nomination of Ms Faull indicated she was
that person.
<P>

21   	The reasons then made reference to certain assertions by
Ms Faull that it was the deceased's intention that she should receive
the
benefit, and concluded:-
<P>

<b>"Though the Tribunal cannot verify the accuracy of the latter references,
the Tribunal believes there is a degree of consistency with
the information
that is clearly documented on the application for Membership.  All this
information is in marked contrast to the
situation with respect to the
Complainant, as there is absolutely no evidence that the Member wished him to
share in any Insured
benefit."</b>
<P>

22   	Nextly the Tribunal considered the relationship with the
deceased, and came to the view that there was basically no communication
between him and Mr Faull after the final separation in 1990.  The Tribunal was
of the view that the relationship between Mr Faull
and the deceased "had
completely broken down by the last years of" the deceased's life, but, on the
other hand, the relationship
between Ms Faull and the deceased was established
as one of mutual support by the time of his death.
<P>

23   	Nextly the Tribunal dealt with the relative needs of Mr
and Ms Faull, to which I have referred, and concluded:-
<P>

<b>"The Tribunal believes the wishes of the Member were clearly expressed close
to the time of his death and that he was of sufficient
maturity to make a sound
and independent judgment.  Those wishes should therefore be given great
weight.</b>
<P>

<b>The Tribunal concludes that, though there was considerable evidence provided
at the genuine responsibility and good intentions of
the Father to care for his
Son in earlier years, for various reasons the relationship established had come
to nought in the final
years of the Member's life.  He chose to keep at a
distance from his Father and to consciously support his Mother with whom he had
a sound and ongoing relationship.</b>
<P>

<b>The Mother was a `dependant' under the terms of the Trust Deed and therefore
entitled to be considered as a beneficiary with respect
to the death benefit.
The Father was not entitled to be considered a beneficiary in his own right,
though the Tribunal could have
allocated some or all of the benefit to a Legal
Personal Representative who would have emerged to deal with the benefit.</b>
<P>

<b>The Tribunal concluded that though the Father demonstrated greater economic
need than the Mother, the death benefit allocation entirely
to the Mother
constituted a decision of the Trustee that was fair and reasonable in all the
circumstances."</b>
<P>

In the result the Tribunal upheld the Trustee's determination.
<P>

<b>The Grounds Of Appeal</b>
<P>

24   	It was accepted by Mr Faull that he must establish the
requirements of s.38(5), the principal and relevant one being that
there is a
manifest error of law on the face of the Award, or that there was strong
evidence that the Tribunal made an error of law
and that the determination of
the question may add, or be likely to add, substantially to the certainty of
commercial law.
<P>

25   	The questions of law raised were:-
<P>

(a)	Whether the mother was a dependant or a partial dependant as a matter of
law or as a matter of fact;
<P>

(b)	Whether the Trustee was correct in concluding that there was no legal
personal representative to whom the moneys would be paid;
<P>

(c)	Whether the Tribunal was correct in having regard to the industry
practice;
<P>

(d)	Whether the Tribunal was correct in finding that it was required to resolve
the dispute by awarding the death benefit to Ms
Faull and/or the legal personal
representative;
<P>

(e)	Whether in accordance with the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/sa1981138/" class="autolink_findacts">Succession Act</a></b> the Trustee was
required to give consideration to and failed to give consideration to the fact
that the Public Trustee was vested
with full authority and power in respect of
the estate; 
<P>

(f)	Whether the Trustee was required to confer with or communicate with the
Public Trustee in respect of his acceptance or otherwise
of being a legal
representative for the estate;
<P>

(g)	Whether the Trustee failed to give full consideration to whether or not $30
a week board was a partial dependency; 
<P>

(h)	Whether Ms Faull was not a dependant by definition, so that no payment
could be ordered to her;
<P>

(i)	The effect of the dramatic change on the parties' financial position
because, if there was a legal representative the amount
would be distributed
according to the law of intestacy; and
<P>

(j)	"That the error of law of the Arbitrator in respect to the rules of
intestacy and the rights of the legal representatives is
communicably
significant".
<P>

26   	An order was also sought pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/sa1981138/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.42</a>, although, as I
understand it, no submissions in relation to this were ultimately made.
<P>

<b>The Questions Of Law Said To Be Raised</b>
<P>

27   	Whilst there are a number of grounds of appeal I consider
that there are three basic matters to which attention must be directed.
Firstly, the proceedings are brought against the Arbitral Award and, in my
opinion, Mr Faull is not entitled to attack the findings
of the Trustee.  If Mr
Faull is to succeed, it must be on the basis that the Award manifests the
necessary error of law.  Secondly,
a principal question is whether Ms Faull was
a partial dependant.  Thirdly, the question is whether the position of the
Public Trustee
should be taken into account, so that there is, on Mr Faull's
submission, a legal personal representative, to whom regard should
have been
paid when the Trustee was exercising its discretion.
<P>

<b>Was Ms Faull A Partial Dependant</b>
<P>

28   	In my opinion the Tribunal's decision that Ms Faull was a
partial dependant cannot be attacked pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/sa1981138/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.38(5).</a>  The Tribunal
accepted that she was being paid $30 per week by way of board, i.e. that she
was being paid $30 per week for providing
lodging and, perhaps, food, for the
deceased and that this provided the basis for the provision of more adequate
and comfortable
accommodation than may otherwise have been available to her.
The short answer to the various submissions made on behalf of Mr Faull
in
relation to this aspect of the matter, is that irrespective of what other
moneys Ms Faull was receiving, she was receiving $30
per week for this service
she provided to the deceased.  The payment of that amount augmented her other
income and, to that extent,
she was dependent upon the deceased for the receipt
of some of her income.  Accordingly, she was "partially dependent" upon the
payments
made by the deceased.
<P>

29   	It may be argued that the word "dependant" means that the
recipient must have a necessity for the money received from the
payer in order
to live to qualify as a dependant.  In my opinion this is giving too narrow a
meaning to the word "dependant", as
defined in sub-paragraph (c).  That is
particularly so when the word, within the definition, encompasses partial
dependency.  The
definition provides that a spouse or child is a "Dependant",
without any need to show financial dependency.  Of course, the degree
of
financial dependency may be a very real question in deciding how the discretion
should be exercised.  This gives colour to the
words in sub-paragraph (c).
<P>

30   	The obvious purpose of the provision was to provide a
category of persons among whom the Trustee may, in the exercise of the
Trustee's discretion, divide or to whom the Trustee, in the exercise of its
discretion, may pay the death benefit.  The determinant
for that, relevantly
for present purposes, was a partial dependency, which must mean a partial
financial dependency.  The receipt
by Ms Faull of $30 per week from the
deceased, in return for the provisions she made for him, constituted such a
dependency, in the
Tribunal's opinion.  In my opinion, on the facts and the
provisions of the definition, this conclusion could not be said to be an
error
of law, let alone a manifest one.  It was one of either fact or mixed fact and
law, and it was not governed by regard to industry
practice.  The Tribunal
clearly considered the facts of this case. Questions of fact or mixed fact and
law are not ones to which
the Court can have regard in considering applications
for leave to appeal: <b>Promenade Investments Pty Limited v The State of New
South Wales</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2026%20NSWLR%20203" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 26 NSWLR 203</a> and <b>Natoli v Walker</b> (Court of Appeal
(New South Wales) - 26 May 1994 - unreported).
<P>

31   	These grounds of appeal must, accordingly, be
dismissed.
<P>

<b>The Personal Representative Point</b>
<P>

32   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/sa1981138/s45.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 45(1)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/sa1981138/" class="autolink_findacts">Succession Act</a></b> 1981 provides
that the property of a deceased person shall, on his or her death and
notwithstanding any testamentary disposition;
<P>

<b>"... devolve to and vest in his or her executor and if more than one as
joint tenants, or, if there is no executor or no executor
able and willing to
act, the public trustee."</b>
<P>

Sub-section (2) provides that upon the grant of probate or letters of
administration the property vested in the persons referred
to in sub-s.(1)
shall devolve to and vest in the person to whom the grant is made, and
sub-s.(4) provides:-
<P>

<b>"The title of any administrator appointed under this Act to any property
which devolves to and vests in the administrator shall relate
back to and be
deemed to have arisen upon the death of the deceased as if there had been no
interval of time between the death and
the appointment."</b>
<P>

33   	Sub-section (6) provides:-
<P>

<b>"While the property of a deceased person is vested in the public trustee
under this section, the public trustee shall not be required
to act in the
administration of the estate of the deceased person or in any trusts created by
the will of the deceased person, or
exercise any discretions, powers, or
authorities of a personal representative, trustee or devisee, merely because of
the provisions
of this section."</b>
<P>

34   	In my opinion <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/sa1981138/s45.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.45</a> does not make the Public Trustee a
legal personal representative, but rather the repository of the property in the
stated circumstances,
sub-s.(4) making it clear that from the appointment of an
administrator, who may be the Public Trustee, there is a relation back
to the
date of death, as if there had been no interval, and sub-s.(6) making it clear
that the Public Trustee is not required to
act in the administration of the
estate by virtue of the devolution of property in him or her.
<P>

35   	The <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/sa1981138/" class="autolink_findacts">Succession Act</a></b> does not, in the particular
circumstances of this case, constitute the Public Trustee either the executor
or administrator of the
deceased's estate.  Accordingly, in finding the Trustee
was correct in its assertion that there is no legal personal representative,
the Tribunal was correct and there is no manifest error of law on the face of
the Award.  I consider that the Tribunal's finding
was one of law, but that
there was no relevant error of law.
<P>

<b>Other Matters</b>
<P>

36   	Even if the views to which I have come are not correct,
there was no obligation on the Tribunal to order that the whole or
any part of
the fund be paid to the legal personal representative, that being a matter
within the discretion of the Trustee and,
I assume, the Tribunal.  In these
circumstances, even if I were of the opinion that there was a manifest error of
law, I would not
be disposed to exercise the discretion to grant leave:
<b>Natoli v Walker</b>.
<P>

37   	The Tribunal clearly gave the most careful, detailed and
compassionate consideration to the demands of Mr Faull, but came
to the
conclusion that the Trustee's decision was the proper decision in all the
circumstances.
<P>

38   	As with the Tribunal, I sympathise with Mr Faull in the
position in which he finds himself. However, I do not consider that
he has
established any basis on which his application can succeed, based as it is on
the provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/sa1981138/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.38(5).</a>  As I have said, no further points were argued in
respect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/sa1981138/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.42.</a>
<P>

39   	In the particular circumstances of this case I am of the
opinion that the proper exercise of discretion, in relation to costs,
is that
there be no order as to costs.  The Tribunal filed a submitting appearance and
Ms Faull did not appear.  Accordingly, neither,
on the evidence before me, has
suffered any significant cost burden.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

40   	(1)	I order that the Summons for leave to appeal filed on
23 July 1999
<P>

	be dismissed.
<P>

(2)	I make no order as to costs.
