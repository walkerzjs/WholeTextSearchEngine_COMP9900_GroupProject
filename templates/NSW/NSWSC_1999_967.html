ORS.</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  	There are current in the Court proceedings
brought at the instance of Permanent Trustee Company Limited and Moreland
Finance Corporation
(Vic) Pty Limited as plaintiffs. In those proceedings there
are seven named defendants. It is sufficient for present purposes to
understand
that among those defendants is a firm of valuers. The plaintiffs have sued
those valuers for damages for negligence in
connection with the valuation of
certain real estate for the purpose of a mortgage advance. In a judgment
delivered on 22 July 1999
Davies AJ of this Court gave judgment for Permanent
Trustee Company Limited against the defendants in the sum of $645,320; and for
Morelend Finance Corporation (Vic) Pty Limited against the defendants in the
sum of $1,263,503.
<P>

2  	In those principal proceedings the defendants have cross-claimed
against H. I. H. Casualty and General Insurance Limited, ["H.I.H"].
The issue
raised by the cross-claim, put simply, is whether H.I.H is contractually
obliged to indemnify the valuers in respect of
the judgments that have been
recovered against them by the plaintiffs.
<P>

3  	H.I.H has disputed that it is so liable upon the relevant
contract of insurance. The position taken in that regard by H.I.H
is,
essentially, that the declaration and proposal respecting the relevant contract
of insurance failed to disclose that the valuers,
who are now claiming
indemnity under the contract of insurance, had become aware of circumstances
which could give rise to a claim
under the policy. H.I.H contends, in the
alternative, that the relevant proposal form as completed by the valuers
contained a misrepresentation.
H.I.H contends that, had that misrepresentation
not occurred, or had the circumstances capable of giving rise to a claim been
disclosed
to it, H.I.H would have excluded from coverage any claim arising out
of the said circumstances; or, in other words, would have excluded
precisely
such a claim as is now made by the valuers. Such a state of affairs entails, in
the contention of H.I.H, that the operation
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.28(3)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance
Contracts Act 1984</a> (C'wealth)</b> would reduce to nil any liability otherwise
accruing to H.I.H under the relevant contract of insurance.
<P>

4  	In the litigious context thus described, two questions were
referred out for consideration by a Referee. The questions were
expressed as
follows:
<P>

"1.	Was there a non-disclosure or a misrepresentation which entitled
............(H.I.H) to reduce its liability under the contracts
of insurance
sued upon to nil?
<P>

2.	If yes to 1, is ............ (H.I.H) obliged to indemnify .............(the
valuers)............ in respect of the claim made
against them by the
plaintiffs in these proceedings?"
<P>

5  	On 5 July 1996 the Referee conducted a hearing during the course
of which he received oral and documentary evidence and submissions
from the
interested parties. On 5 August 1996 the Referee published his report. The
Referee answered question 1: no; and question
2: not applicable.
<P>

6  	By a notice of motion filed on 26 July 1999, the plaintiffs in
the principal proceedings apply for orders: that the report of
the Referee
dated 5 August 1996 be adopted in full by this Court; that the Court makes such
further or other orders as it thinks
fit; and that the costs of the motion be
paid by the valuers.
<P>

7  	The adjudication of such an application is governed by SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/index.html#p72" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 72.</a>
R 13 of that part provides, so far as is relevant, as follows:
<P>

"13(1)	Where a report is made, the court may, ...................on application
by any party, on a matter of fact or law or both
-
<P>

(a)	adopt, vary or reject the report in whole or in part;
<P>

(b)	[not applicable]
<P>

(c)	[not applicable]
<P>

(d)	decide any matter on the evidence taken before the referee, with or without
additional evidence,
<P>

	and shall give such judgment or make such order as the Court thinks fit.
<P>

(2)	Evidence additional to the evidence taken before the referee may not be
adduced before the court except with the leave of the
court."
<P>

8  	At the hearing before this Court, the plaintiffs, H.I.H and (put
simply) the valuers were all represented by counsel.
<P>

9  	At the hearing, a great deal of time was occupied in the
resolution of a dispute concerning the proper admissibility in evidence
before
this Court of the transcript of the proceedings before the Referee, and of
certain associated documentary exhibits which had
been received in evidence by
the Referee. The competing contentions have been recorded; the record has been
transcribed; and it is
not necessary here to repeat in fine detail these
arguments. I received a folder containing such of this material as H.I.H
desired
to put into evidence before this Court, and marked it Exhibit 1 in the
proceedings before this Court. I do not see any need for a
present extended
discussion of the theoretical principles concerning the admissibility of
Exhibit 1. I have taken the view that the
nature of the objections made by
H.I.H to the Referee's report is such as to require a proper, which is to say a
properly contained,
reference by this Court to the course of proceedings before
the Referee.
<P>

10  	Nor do I see any present utility in an extended canvass of the
principles which have been established as the criteria by reference
to which
this Court is to consider an application, such as the present one, for the
adoption of a Referee's report. The relevant
principles are the subject of a
number of decisions, of which the leading authority in this Court is probably
the decision of the
Court of Appeal in <b>Super Pty Ltd (formerly known as Leda
Constructions Pty Ltd)  v  SJP Formwork (Aust) Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%2029%20NSWLR%20549" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 29 NSWLR 549.</a>
I have read the report of that particular decision; and I proceed for present
purposes upon the basis that the principles there established
are those by
which I am now to be guided. I think that a proper application of those
principles in any particular case depends, at
least to some extent, upon the
way in which a party objecting to the adoption by the Court of the particular
report frames the grounds
of such objection.
<P>

11  	In the present particular matter, learned counsel for H.I.H put
in substantial written submissions. They summarise in a helpful
form the errors
allegedly made by the Referee. That written summary was expanded somewhat in
the oral submissions put by counsel
for H.I.H. Combining the written and oral
submissions, a summary statement of the errors asserted by H.I.H to have been
made by the
Referee is as follows:
<P>

1.	The primary error of the Referee was in the construction he gave to certain
questions and answers in the relevant proposal form.
It is contended in this
regard that <i>"(such) process involved a question of law or alternatively, a
question of mixed fact and law with the result that the Court should
review the
Referee's finding and the evidence in order to determine for itself whether the
conclusion reached by the Referee was
correct or not"</i>.
<P>

2.	Central to the relevant process of reasoning which the Referee should have
followed was a letter written on behalf of the plaintiffs
to the valuers and
marked for the attention of Mr. Rowan, one of the employees of the valuers.
That letter read, so far as is material
to the present submission of H.I.H, as
follows:
<P>

"With respect to your concerns about a possible claim against your Professional
Indemnity Insurance, please be advised that we have
instructed solicitors to
provide advices in this matter.
<P>

Your earliest attention to this matter would be appreciated."
<P>

3.	The relevant portion of the proposal form was in two parts. The first part,
described as Question 4.1, asked whether a claim
had been made. An affirmative
answer to that question called for the furnishing of relevant particulars. The
answer given in the
relevant proposal was: <i>"Yes"</i>; but no particulars
were provided. The letter referred to in 2 above, upon its proper construction,
did not constitute, however,
a <i>"claim"</i> so that the failure to give
particulars of the answer to question 4.1 was irrelevant.
<P>

4.	An associated question in the proposal form, denominated as question 4.3,
was answered in the negative. This was a misrepresentation.
Question 4.3 was in
the following form:
<P>

"4.3	Are you, the proponent, or any of your partners, aware of any
circumstances that could give rise to any claim being made against
you or your
partners or against your predecessors in business or any former partners?"
<P>

5.	The Referee erred in concluding, as he did, that question 4.1 had been
answered correctly. The Referee did not deal with the
evidence which had been
called before him from Mr. Gregory Brown, General Manager of H.I.H and dealing
with the construction of question
4.1. The correct setting for a consideration
of question 4.1 was the wording of an earlier policy of which the valuers and
their
servants and agents must have been aware. That wording contained a
definition of <i>"claim"</i> which could not encompass the letter referred to
in 2 above. That letter itself could not be found, on any reasonable view, to
make
a demand. It could not be characterised, on any reasonable view, as a
<i>"claim"</i>. The relevant officer of the valuers was not called to give
evidence before the Referee. This raised a <b>Jones v Dunkel</b> point, with
which the Referee ought to have dealt, but did not in fact deal, in his
report.
<P>

6.	The Referee should have determined that the correct answer to the question
4.1 would have been: no. In that event, the correct
answer to the question 4.3
ought to have been: yes. 
<P>

7.	In the alternative, the question 4.3 should have been answered, in any
event: yes.
<P>

8.	In connection with the question 4.3, the Referee had erred in finding that
the receipt of the letter referred to in 2 above was
not a
<i>"circumstance"</i> which could give rise to a claim.
<P>

9.	The error asserted in 8 above can be demonstrated from the wording of the
letter itself. The letter refers to a <i>"possible claim"</i>. This entails:
<i>first,</i> that the letter itself cannot be a <i>"claim"</i>; and
<i>secondly</i>, that the notification made by the letter does satisfy the
description of <i>"a circumstance likely to give rise to a claim"</i>.
<P>

10.	The Referee did not deal with submissions made to him by H.I.H to the
effect that the relevant representative of the valuers
had not regarded the
letter referred to in 2 above as evidencing a <i>"claim"</i>.
<P>

11.	The Referee erred in failing to have any regard in connection with:
<P>

(a)	The answering of the questions referred to him;
<P>

	(b)	The drawing of inferences from the failure of the relevant representative
of the valuers to give evidence before him;
<P>

	(c)	His approach to the construction of the proposal form;
<P>

	to the contents of a document that was admitted into evidence as Exhibit 2
before the Referee. This document reads as follows:
<P>

"Stuart N Rowan		Egan Rowan Consultants Valuers P/L
<P>

			R.V. Dimond Pty. Ltd
<P>

			R.V. Dimond (Sales) P/L
<P>

			Prubook Holding P/L
<P>

			Suhijo P/L &amp; Car Parks P/L
<P>

Geoff Gordon		R V Dimond (Sales) P/L
<P>

ANNEXURE 2
<P>

We have received a notice of demand dated 23 November 1990 from Permanent
Trustee Company Limited which has been referred to Messrs.
Steeves Lumley &amp;
Co. and its solicitors Messrs Phillips Fox &amp; Co.
<P>

Note:	R. V. Dimond (Sales) on demand letter - proposed claim strenuously
denied."
<P>

12  	I should mention for the sake of completeness a further
submission put by H.I.H in the second paragraph of its principal written
submissions. That submission is in the following terms:
<P>

"H.I.H opposes the adoption of the Report in any event. It is submitted that
the Plaintiffs do not have standing to do so. The Report
does not deal with any
issue between the plaintiff and H.I.H. There are no pleadings between H.I.H and
the plaintiffs."
<P>

13  	Upon reviewing, as I have done, the transcript of the hearing
before this Court, I am not clear whether H.I.H presses this
particular
submission. I indicate, therefore, and for more abundant caution, that I reject
the submission. The plaintiffs have in
their favour a judgment of this Court
against the valuers. The plaintiffs have an obvious interest in the effective
enforcement of
their judgment. That effective enforcement depends, in
significant degree, upon the liability of H.I.H to indemnify the valuers.
The
adoption, or the rejection, by this Court of the Referee's report has obvious
importance in the resolution of the question whether
that liability falls, in
the events which have happened, upon H.I.H. Those considerations are
sufficient, in my opinion, to dispose
of this particular contention of
H.I.H.
<P>

14  	It is convenient to turn, next, to the way in which the Referee
dealt with the question 4.1, and the answer given to it, in
the relevant
insurance proposal form. The Referee's exposed process of reasoning in that
connection is both succinct and clear, and
is better quoted than glossed. The
Referee says:
<P>

"In dealing with these issues it seems to me that the correct approach is to
ascertain, upon a fair reading of the terms of the
questions, what was required
of the proponent at the time he made the declaration, in this case on 23
December 1991.
<P>

Question 4.1 requires information as to claims made up to the date of the
declaration. The term "claim" has no definition and so
one looks to its natural
and ordinary meaning which includes "an assertion of a right or alleged right;
an assertion of something
as a fact" (Macquarie Dictionary 2nd Edition). Thus
Question 4.1 may be read widely as a request for information as to claims
whether
spurious, sound, established, alleged or threatened.
<P>

Mr. Rowan answered Question 4.1 "Yes". It is reasonable to assume that at the
time he answered the question he had in mind at least
the letter and the
matters alluded to in it. A fair reading of the letter clearly suggests the
existence of a possible claim, or
the threat of one, of a kind which generated
sufficient concern in Mr. Rowan to result in the retention of solicitors to
advise on
the matter. The very terms of the question left it to him to make a
judgment as to whether the information he had before him amounted
to a claim in
its ordinary meaning.
<P>

The evidence does not enable one to know the extent of the information before
Mr. Rowan at the relevant time which caused him to
give the answer he made,
although obviously it consisted of more than the bare statement in the letter
quoted above. In any event,
the statement in the letter, although it may be
argued that it should not be construed as a claim, cannot be read as negating a
claim.
<P>

In my view, the evidence relied upon by H.I.H, such as it was, establishes that
Mr. Rowan was entirely justified in answering Question
4.1 "Yes". It certainly
does not provide a basis for a finding that such an answer was untrue."
<P>

15  	As to this process of reasoning, I express the following
opinions:
<P>

1.	I agree that the term <i>"claim"</i> is not defined in the relevant
insurance proposal form. I do not agree with the submission of H.I.H that
question 4.1 needed to be
considered by the Referee <i>"against the background
of the wording of an earlier policy of which Mr. Rowan must have been aware
which contained a definition of
claim, which definition could not encompass the
subject letter"</i>. The insurance proposal form seems to me, on the evidence
available to this Court, to be a stand-alone document in the sense that
it does
not incorporate in any general way the contents of the current policy of
insurance; and, in particular, the terms of any
definitions contained in the
current policy of insurance. There are in the insurance proposal form some
particular references to
aspects of the current policy of insurance; but, as I
say, there is no general incorporation into the insurance proposal form of
definitions appearing in the current policy of insurance. Nor was there before
the Referee, as it seems to me, any evidence to support
the proposition, now
advanced by H.I.H, that Mr. Rowan must have been aware of the definition of
<i>"claim"</i> contained in the relevant current policy of insurance; still
less that Mr. Rowan, when he completed the insurance proposal form,
did in fact
have a conscious awareness of any such definition.
<P>

2.	That being so, I agree with the Referee that it was necessary to look to the
natural and ordinary meaning of the words, in question
4.1: <i>"Have any claims
been made against you ..........."</i>.
<P>

3.	I do not agree, however, that such inquiry led as its first step to relevant
dictionary definitions, or to any other extraneous
material. What the Referee
was required to do, as it seems to me, was not only to give the words of
question 4.1 their natural and
ordinary grammatical meaning; but also to give
the words that meaning in a way that was consonant with the context in which
the words
appear. 
<P>

4.	That context is not, in my opinion, limited rigidly to question 4.1 itself.
It is true that questions 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 are distinct
questions distinctly
posed in the insurance proposal form. It is, however, equally clear, in my
opinion, that questions 4.1, 4.2
and 4.3 are, notwithstanding that distinctness
of their expression, related questions having to do with the general topic,
nominated
in the very heading of the relevant portion of the insurance proposal
form as: <i>"4. CLAIMS HISTORY"</i>.
<P>

5.	Approached in that way, it can be seen, in my opinion, that questions 4.1
and 4.3 aim at distinct, but complementary, matters.
Question 4.1 aims at a
claim that has actually been made against the proponent or the proponent's
present partners. Question 4.3
is aimed clearly, in my opinion, at the
complementary situation where no such claim has actually been made; but where
the proponent
or any of the proponent's partners is aware of circumstances of
which a reasonably prudent businessman would understand that, although
a claim
had not actually been made, it was <i>"on the cards", </i>(to borrow from Gibbs
J in <b>Alister v The Queen</b> (1984) 154 CLR 404 at 414); or not <i>"far
fetched or fanciful", </i>( to borrow from Mason J in <b>Wyong Shire Council v
Shirt </b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1980/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] HCA 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20146%20CLR%2040" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 146 CLR 40</a> at 47), that such a claim might actually eventuate
in the future.
<P>

6.	It seems to me to follow, therefore, that the answer: <i>"Yes"</i> given to
question 4.1 should be understood as a disclosure by the proponent that a claim
had actually been made against the proponent;
and that the proposed insurer was
entitled to have that fact disclosed as being something within the
contemplation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.21(1)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act</a></b>.
<P>

7.	I agree with the Referee that the evidence before him, exiguous in the
extreme as it was, did not provide a basis for any finding
by the Referee that
the answer, as thus given to question 4.1, was untrue. But neither was there
any evidence before the Referee,
so far at least as I can see, capable of
establishing that the answer was, in a literal and particular sense, true. It
seems to me
that the evidence before the Referee, such as it was, was wholly
neutral on the point.
<P>

8.	What can be said about the answer to question 4.1, and notwithstanding the
paucity of the available evidence about the process
of reasoning that led to
the making of the answer, is that it was, on the face of the insurance proposal
form, an incomplete answer
in as much as <i>"full particulars"</i>, which the
proposal form plainly called for in the case of an affirmative answer to
question 4.1, were not ever provided. H.I.H accepted,
nevertheless, the
proposal for insurance. It seems to me to follow that, by reason of the
operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s. 21(3)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act</a></b>, H.I.H was deemed
to have waived compliance with what would otherwise have been the statutory
duty of disclosure in connection with
the matter of claims actually made. The
Referee came to that conclusion. In my opinion he was correct to do so.
<P>

9.	It is apparent from a reading of the Referee's expressed process of
reasoning in connection with question 4.1 that the Referee
took the view that
he was entitled to draw from the evidence before him an inference that the
person who answered question 4.1 had
in mind, at the time of the giving of the
answer, at least the contents of the letter of 23 October 1991. The Referee
thought, also,
that it was obvious that some information which <i>"consisted of
more than the bare statement in the letter"</i> had been present to the mind of
the person who completed the answer to question 4.1. For the sake of
completeness, I express my respectful
disagreement with the drawing by the
Referee of these inferences. In the absence of evidence from Mr. Rowan, the
officer of the valuers
who completed the insurance proposal form, I cannot see
that there was any hard evidence from which either of the suggested inferences
could be logically drawn.
<P>

10.	To say that I am in respectful disagreement with various aspects of the
Referee's approach to question 4.1 and its answer, does
not entail, as of
course, that I must refuse to adopt the Referee's report in so far as it deals
with that question and answer; <b>Astor Properties Pty Ltd v L'Union des
Assurances de Paris</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2017%20NSWLR%20483" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 17 NSWLR 483.</a> I shall return to this point
presently; but before doing so I turn to the way in which the Referee
approached the question and answer
4.3
<P>

16  	As to the question numbered 4.3, also, the Referee's exposed
process of reasoning is succinct and clear. It is in the following
terms:
<P>

"With regard to the terms of Question 4.3 it should be observed that as a
matter of ordinary English usage a "circumstance" is "a
state of affairs, an
incident, occurrence or event" (Macquarie Dictionary supra). By itself, the
letter is not a "circumstance" within
the meaning of Question 4.3. Even if it
allows the inference that the proponent was aware of circumstances that could
give rise to
a claim as at 23 October 1991, in my view it does not prove that
those circumstances necessarily remained of that kind as at 23 December
1991.
<P>

Indeed, on one view of things it may be said that the contention that Question
4.3 should have been answered "Yes" depends upon
acceptance of the proposition
that as at 23 December 1991 the letter was the entirety of the information
before the proponent. To
do so involves an exercise in speculation which should
not be undertaken.
<P>

It follows, in my view, that it is not open to H.I.H to say that because the
letter in its terms should not be understood as conveying
a claim it was
necessary to answer Question 4.3 "Yes" irrespective of the answer given to
Question 4.1."
<P>

17  	As to this process of reasoning, I express the following
opinions:
<P>

1.	I agree with the Referee that the letter of 23 October 1991 was not itself a
<i>"circumstance"</i> of the kind contemplated by question 4.3. I think,
however, that it is clear from the terms of the letter that it communicated
<i>"circumstances"</i> in the sense contemplated by that question. 
<P>

2.	I agree with the Referee that it was a question for consideration whether
the <i>"circumstances"</i> as communicated by the letter of 23 October 1991
remained current 2 months later when the relevant insurance proposal form was
completed
by Mr. Rowan on behalf of the valuers.
<P>

3.	I do not agree, however, with the conclusion of the Referee that the
evidence before him, such as it was, did not permit of the
drawing of a
reasonable inference that the circumstances communicated in October 1991 did
indeed remain current in December 1991.
The relevant principles in that regard
are well established. It is convenient to refer briefly to two particular
expositions of them.
<P>

	In <b>Gurnett and Macquarie Stevedoring Co Pty Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281955%29%2055%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20243" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1955) 55 SR (NSW) 243</a>
at 248, Street CJ, speaking for a majority of the Full Court, said:
<P>

"A guess is a mere opinion or judgment formed at random and based on slight or
uncertain grounds. In contradistinction to such a
conjectural opinion, an
inference is a reasonable conclusion drawn as a matter of strict logical
deduction from known or assumed
facts. It must be something which follows from
given premises as certainly or probably true, and the mere possibility of truth
is
not sufficient to justify an inference to that effect."
<P>

	In <b>Australian Blue Metal Limited v Hughes &amp; ors.</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281961%29%2079%20WN%20%28NSW%29%20498" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1961) 79 WN (NSW)
498</a> at 513, Jacobs J, speaking of what is conventionally referred to as the
<b>Jones v Dunkel</b> principle, says of that principle that it:
<P>

"...................is not limited to inferences in respect of a defendant's
conduct arising from his own failure to give evidence,
but extends to
inferences arising from a defendant's failure to call any witness who might be
expected to be called by him to give
direct evidence on facts which the other
party seeks to establish by inference."
<P>

18  	The application of those principles to the evidence, such as it
was, before the Referee in the present case, seems to me to
justify the
following reasoning:
<P>

(a)	The letter of 23 October 1991 is addressed to the personal attention of Mr.
Rowan. 
<P>

(b)	The letter is marked, prominently, with a stamp reading <i>"URGENT"</i>.
There is no reason to think that the letter was not despatched urgently to the
valuers; and there is no evidence either that it
was not received by the
valuers, or that it was received by them but for some reason or other did not
find its way to the attention
of Mr. Rowan.
<P>

(c)	The valuers, and Mr. Rowan in particular, were uniquely well placed, as
between themselves and their insurer H.I.H, to furnish
evidence as to the
currency or otherwise at the date of completion of the insurance proposal form
of the <i>"circumstances"</i> communicated by the letter of 23 October 1991.

<P>

(d)	That evidence could have been provided easily by calling Mr. Rowan to give
evidence of anything that had come to his attention
between 23 October and 23
December, being anything indicative of the <i>"circumstances"</i> having
changed in any relevant way between the two dates.
<P>

(e)	In the alternative, it would have been a simple matter for the valuers to
have produced to the Referee any relevant documentary
material showing such a
change in the <i>"circumstances"</i> between the two relevant dates.
<P>

(f)	Mr. Rowan was not called to give evidence, and his failure to give evidence
was, so far as I can see from the available material,
wholly unexplained. 
<P>

(g)	Nor, so far as I can see, was anything else put before the Referee so as to
establish that the <i>"circumstances"</i> communicated in October 1991 were not
current on the relevant date in December 1991.
<P>

(h)	In that evidentiary setting, it was more than a mere possibility, and was,
as a matter of reasonable inference, more probable
than not, that nothing
relevant changed in the <i>"circumstances"</i> between October and December
1991. 
<P>

19  	It follows, therefore, that it ought, in my opinion, to have
been found on the probabilities that question 4.3 ought to have
been answered:
<i>"Yes"</i>; and that the answer in fact given was, therefore, wrong in fact
and did not disclose something that ought to have been disclosed
by the
proponent.
<P>

20  	As earlier herein noted, the Referee came to the conclusion that
compliance with the statutory duty of disclosure had been
waived in connection
with question 4.1. The Referee concluded, also, that there had been such a
waiver in connection with question
4.3. In my opinion, that conclusion was not
supported by the evidence before the Referee. It seems to me that the answer in
fact
provided to question 4.3 did not constitute a failure to answer as
contemplated by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.21(3)(a)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/" class="autolink_findacts">Insurance Contracts Act</a></b>; and that it
was not <i>"an obviously incomplete or irrelevant answer"</i> to question 4.3,
as contemplated by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.21(3)(b)</a> of that Act. I cannot see, therefore, where there
is a basis for a holding that H.I.H waived compliance, by reason of the deeming
provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/s21.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.21(3)</a> with the relevant duty of disclosure in relation to
question 4.3. Nor do I see in the evidence before the Referee, or in anything
else now before this Court, evidence of a waiver <i>aliunde</i> by H.I.H.
<P>

21  	There are two further matters to be considered in the light of
the submissions that were made to this Court at the recent hearing;
and,
presently, I shall have something to say about both of them. What I shall thus
say does not affect, however, what I am about
to say by way of conclusions
reached in the light of the whole of the foregoing discussion.
<P>

22  	I am very conscious of the fact that what I am now called upon
to do is to exercise a judicial discretion. In that connection,
I have had, as
earlier herein indicated, regard to the clear statements of policy and of
principle that are contained in the <b>Super Pty Ltd</b> decision. I have had
regard, as well, to the discussion of relevant principle that forms part of the
judgment of Giles J in <b>Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v C.E. Heath
Underwriting Services Ltd &amp; ors. </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%208%20ANZ%20Insurance%20Cases%2061%2d231" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 8 ANZ Ins. Cas. 61-231:</a> see in
particular the material that follows the heading <i>"The approach to the
report"</i> at 75, 533-75,534. I have considered, as well, a similar discussion
by Cole J in <b>Chloride Batteries Australia Ltd v Glendale Chemical Products
Pty Ltd </b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1988%5d%2017%20NSWLR%2060" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1988] 17 NSWLR 60:</a> see in particular at 66G-69D.
<P>

23  	In the present particular case, the Referee was one of Her
Majesty's counsel of acknowledged learning and experience. I hesitate
to refuse
to adopt a report from a Referee of such standing; and I would not so refuse in
fact for the reason, only, that I, had
I been in the Referee's position, would
have decided particular questions, resolved particular issues, or assessed
particular evidence,
in a way different from that taken by the Referee. I have
come, however, to the clear conclusion that the aggregate effect of the
matters
to which I have drawn attention in the preceding discussion is such that it
would not be a proper exercise of the relevant
discretion to adopt the
particular report.
<P>

24  	Of the two outstanding issues to which I have earlier referred,
the first is the submission numbered 11 in the summary of H.I.H's
submissions
as set out at the beginning of this judgment. This submission turns upon the
contents and effect of the document that
became Exhibit 2 in the proceedings
before the Referee. The contents of that document have been set out earlier in
this judgment.
<P>

25  	Exhibit 2 was introduced into evidence during the course of a
very brief re-examination of Mr. Brown. In cross-examination,
Mr. Brown had
explained that at the times relevant to the matters in issue before the
Referee, an affirmative answer to question
4.1 in the insurance proposal form
would have triggered a procedure to investigate whether there was any record of
such a claim in
any claim history of the proponent with the proposed insurer.
Mr. Brown explained that such procedure involved looking up some record
or
other on a computer screen. His relevant answers continued as follows:
<P>

".............. If you look up the computer screen and there is no claim
history, right, the next step is, you would say to the
broker, `what is the
problem here, there is no claims history'. Now the broker then presumably, if
he is smart, would go back to
the insured and say, `you have answered `yes' 
<P>

Q.	`What is the meaning of it?'
<P>

A.	Yes. Alternatively, in this situation, the broker, seeing the answer `yes'
would look up his computer screen, again assuming
there is nothing on there,
would go to the insured and if the answer from the insured was, `no there had
been no claims made against
me', he would not refer the file to us. There would
be no need. He would merely note on his file that the answer was incorrect. 
<P>

Q.	We are surmising about what the broker would do?
<P>

A.	That is right."
<P>

26  	The re-examination of Mr. Brown consisted of a bare handful of
questions as follows:
<P>

"Q.	You were asked some questions ...........(by counsel) ..............about
previous claims. Do you, seeing you are unaided by
any documents, have any
recollection of any other claims involving ............. (the valuers)
.............. under your scheme?
<P>

A.	The name comes to mind. Whether it is a pre or post this event I'm not sure.
We have sort of, since we started, something like
23,000 claims. I do not run
an index in my mind.
<P>

Q.	I show you this document. Have you seen that document before or something
like it? That is just a yes or no answer to that, please.
<P>

A.	Well, I don't know about that document per se, but it certainly ....
<P>

[THE REFEREE]: Q.	I think it is a yes or no?
<P>

A.	Yes.
<P>

[COUNSEL]	Q.	Yes, you have?
<P>

A.	Yes."
<P>

27  	The document was then tendered. There was no objection to the
tender, and the document was thereupon admitted and marked as
Exhibit 2. The
upshot of this evidence seems to me to be as follows:
<P>

1.	It is not at all clear whether Mr. Brown was saying that he had seen the
particular document before; or that he had seen <i>"something like it"</i> on a
previous occasion.
<P>

2.	The evidence before the Referee, and, so far as I can see, the evidence
before this Court, does not give any explanation at all
of the contents of
Exhibit 2. There is no evidence as to what the document actually is. There is
no evidence of any system according
to which it was either produced, or kept on
record. The document on its face contains materials which are described as
<i>"Annexure 1"</i> and <i>"Annexure 2"</i>; but there is no evidence to
indicate what it is to which the document is supposed to be an annexure.
<P>

3.	I think that it is a reasonable inference from the fact that counsel for the
valuers and for the individual employees or officers
of the valuers took no
objection to the tender, that counsel saw the document as having some relevance
to the matters in issue before
the Referee. The Referee himself did not query
the relevance of the document; and nobody on either side of the record gave the
Referee
any explanation, however brief, of the supposed relevance of the
document.
<P>

4.	It is submitted that the Referee fell into error by reason of a failure on
his part to have regard, in the way more particularly
set out in the submission
as previously summarised, to the contents of Exhibit 2. I do not agree that the
Referee fell into such
an error. Everything about Exhibit 2 was, in the final
state of the evidence before the Referee, so imprecise as to have afforded,
in
my opinion, no assistance at all to the Referee in connection with the
particular questions that he was called upon to decide.
<P>

28  	The only remaining submission about which I think something
particular should be said is a submission that was made by learned
counsel
appearing for the valuers and for certain individual defendants in the
principal proceedings. Counsel submitted that the
discretion conferred upon
this Court by SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ica1984220/index.html#p72" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 72</a> is so unfettered as to permit of this Court's adopting
a report, notwithstanding a clear conviction on the part of the Court that
the
report is, for whatever reason, unsustainable whether in law or in fact or both
in law and in fact. It is, I think, sufficient
in the circumstances of the
present case if I say simply that I reject that submission. The relevant
authorities to which I have
earlier referred uniformly stress the breadth of
the relevant discretion and that it is a discretion to be exercised judicially.
Those authorities are uniform, also, in enjoining a proper judicial restraint
in connection with the adoption or rejection of a particular
report from a
Referee. There is, however, one further point on which the authorities are of
one accord, and that is the need to ensure
that in any particular case the
Court does not exercise the relevant judicial discretion in such a way as
promotes administrative
efficiency or bare utilitarianism at the cost of
justice. That proposition entails necessarily, as it seems to me, that it
cannot
be correct to suppose that the Court would be justified in adopting a
report of which it was clearly and properly convinced that
the report
misconceived the relevant law; misapprehended the relevant facts; or reached
conclusions that were manifestly unsustainable
on a proper view of the
available evidence concerning them.
<P>

29  	Having decided, for the whole of the foregoing reasons, that I
decline to adopt the Referee's report in the present case, it
remains to
consider what ancillary orders should thereupon be made. In that regard, I give
direction as follows:
<P>

1.	The plaintiffs in the principal proceedings are to file and serve not later
than 7 days from today Short Minutes of Orders giving
effect to the present
judgment, and to its practical consequences in the principal proceedings.
<P>

2.	Not later than 7 days thereafter the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th defendants in the
principal proceedings and H.I.H are to file and
serve upon the plaintiffs in
the principal proceedings written submissions, both as to the orders proposed
by the plaintiffs, and
as to any proposed alternative orders.
<P>

3.	Upon compliance with the directions given in 1 and 2 above, the proceedings
in this Court may be re-listed for any necessary
argument in connection with,
and for the making of, appropriate orders necessary to give practical effect to
the present judgment.
Any party to the present proceedings in this Court may
have those proceedings so re-listed upon 3 days' notice by letter or by
facsimile
transmission to all other interested parties, and for a day
convenient to the Court and the parties.
<P>
