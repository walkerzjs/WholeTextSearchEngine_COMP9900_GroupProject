<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR : </b> The plaintiff commenced these proceedings by Statement
of Claim on 19 February 1999 and claimed orders adjusting the property
interests
of the parties under the <i>De Facto Relationships Act</i> 1984 (NSW)
in respect of a relationship which existed from about April 1994 until July
1998.  The plaintiff claims by way of adjustment
orders that the house property
which he owns at Wahroonga be transferred to the defendant, alternatively be
sold and the proceeds
paid to the defendant, and an order that the motor
vehicle which the defendant now drives be transferred to the defendant.  The
defendant
in her Defence and Cross-claim filed on 29 March 1999 admits the
relationship and alleges that there was an earlier relationship
from November
1988 to December 1992, alleges contributions by her, alleges that the
Cross-Defendant owns substantial assets unknown
to her and makes further
claims relating to adjustment including an order that the Cross-defendant pay
her $500,000.00, and also
maintenance of $500.00 per week under s 27 of the
<i>De Facto Relationships Act</i> 1984 until 20 October 2007.  She also claims
an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/csa1989294/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 117</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/csa1989294/" class="autolink_findacts">Child Support (Assessment) Act </i>1989</a> (Cth)
relating to child support for the two children of the parties who were born on
2 October 1990 and 20 October 1995.
<P>

2	The plaintiff made an Application, also filed on 19 February 1999, to the
Family Court of Australia at Sydney for orders relating
to the parenting of the
children, with detailed orders dealing with contact and defining dates and
times, at week-ends, during the
school week, at holiday times and telephone
contact.  The defendant filed a Response in the Family Court dated 26 March
1999 which
claims orders relating to parenting which differ in detail from the
orders claimed by the plaintiff.
<P>

3	The defendant now applies by Notice of Motion filed on 29 March 1999 for a
Cross-Vesting Order under subs 5 (1) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/joca1987427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts
(Cross-Vesting) Act</i> 1987</a> (NSW) transferring the proceedings to the Family
Court of Australia.
<P>

4	Neither party has asked the Family Court of Australia to make orders dealing
with the maintenance of their children.  Questions
of maintenance are
ordinarily dealt with administratively and come before the courts only on
appeal or review of administrative decisions
under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/csa1989294/" class="autolink_findacts">Child Support
(Assessment) Act</i> 1989</a> (Cth).  However the defendant has in her Cross-claim
made a claim under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/csa1989294/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 117</a> of that Act, and contends that there are special
circumstances for which that section provides so that the Court should make a
maintenance
order.  This application in her Cross-claim is the only embodiment
of any controversy relating to maintenance of the children;  there
have been no
administrative proceedings or other proceedings under Child Support
legislation.  Were it not for this claim in her
Cross-claim there would be no
dispute about maintenance.  The defendant's responsibility for the care of the
children is relevant
to her claim under s 27 of the <i>De Facto Relationships
Act</i>, but that claim could not lead to a maintenance order in respect of the
children being made under State legislation.  An administrative
authority or a
court which decided a dispute about the maintenance of the children could not,
unless legislation limited the subject
matters which could be considered, come
to a decision without knowing what property and financial resources each party
has available.
 The same must be said of the Claim and Cross-claim under the
<i>De Facto Relationships Act</i>.
<P>

5	The approach which I should take is indicated by judgments, principally that
of Rogers AJA, in <i>Bankinvest AG v Seabrook &amp; Ors</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20711" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 14 NSWLR
711.</a>  Although some passages in Street CJ's observations could be thought to
make a different formulation of the approach to be taken
they concluded by
saying that the reasons prepared by Rogers AJA are definitive of the law and
practice on this topic in New South
Wales.  The central consideration is which
court is the more appropriate forum for the case:  "What court is more
appropriate and
what court is pointed to by the interests of justice."
(<i>Bankinvest</i> at 728). I have also been referred to some first instance
decisions;  the decision of Mr Justice Einstein in <i>Murrant v Singleton</i>
(unreported 15 July 1998) and my own decision in <i>O'Mara v Perry</i>
(unreported 26 March 1998).  There have been many occasions when cross-vesting
applications have been considered at first instance;
 they are dominated by
their facts and by the authoritative exposition in the <i>Bankinvest</i> case,
and expressions in those cases do not carry my consideration any further.  In
my view, the parties' controversy as it now stands
has a more real and
substantial connexion with the Supreme Court of New South Wales than with any
other court;  this Court is the
appropriate forum as the Court upon which
jurisdiction was conferred by the Parliament of New South Wales when it created
remedies
in respect of de facto relationships.  The parenting aspects of the
controversy as it is now constituted appear to me to be no more
than ancillary
to the dispute between the parties relating to property.  The dispute relating
to parenting does not (according to
the claims which have been made up to the
present time before the Family Court) involve any need for detailed
consideration of the
assets, financial resources, income or other means of
parties.  In terms of subs 5 (1) (b) (i) the proceedings are related, but in
my
view they are not closely related.  The matters on which the parties are in
difference relating to parenting appear to me to be
of relatively small
importance, such as should be and well could be resolved by conciliation.
<P>

6	In my opinion the appropriate forum for the defendant's Cross-claim for
maintenance for herself, under s 27 of the <i>De Facto Relationships Act</i>,
is the court upon which jurisdiction in de facto relationships litigation was
conferred by legislation.  The claim for a remedy
in special circumstances
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/csa1989294/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 117</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/csa1989294/" class="autolink_findacts">Child Support (Assessment) Act</i> 1989</a> is at present no
more than a minor part of the controversy relating to parenting;  its part is
no more than that the defendant has
invoked it in her Cross-claim, as there has
not been any exchange of positions between the parties, no claim to provide in
some way
for the maintenance of the infants followed by a failure to meet it,
and little of substance in child maintenance as part of a controversy.
 The
position may develop differently, but I have to decide the application now.
When the question of child support is developed,
it may well be resolved in a
satisfactory way by administrative procedures;  it remains to emerge whether
this will happen.  In terms
of subs 5 (1) (b) (ii) (A), the claim under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/csa1989294/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 117</a>
would but for Cross-vesting legislation have been incapable of being instituted
in the Supreme Court.  In terms of subs (5) (1) (b)
(ii) (B) the matters for
determination are, to a limited extent only, matters arising under Commonwealth
law and not otherwise within
the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
<P>

7	It is an important consideration that the number of law-suits between the
parties and the number of places in which issues relating
to their means are
examined by courts should be minimised;  one law-suit is better than two.
However when I weigh this factor with
other matters under my consideration it
does not outweigh other factors.  The litigation in the Family Court relating
to parenting,
if it ever comes to hearing, is likely to be very modest in
scale.
<P>

8	In my judgment the interests of justice do not support a Cross-Vesting
Order.
<P>

9	The Notice of Motion of 29 March 1999 is dismissed with costs.
<P>

I hereby certify that paragraphs 1-9 are the reasons for judgment of the
Honourable Justice John Bryson.
<P>
