WEDNESDAY 28 JULY 1999
<P>

<b>2370/99	NAPATARRA P/L v PERPETUAL TRUSTEE CO. LTD</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiff operates a fast food shop called
Charlie's Chopsticks at Shop E10 in the Food Court at the Charlestown
Square
Shopping Centre.  The plaintiff first leased the shop from Burns Philip Trustee
Co. Ltd. by lease from 4 April 1989 to 3 April
1994 and when that expired by a
sublease granted by ANZ Leasing (NSW) Pty Ltd from 4 April 1994 to 3 April
1999.  In some way ANZ
Leasing's leasehold ended before expiry of the sublease,
the second defendant Perpetual became registered proprietor of the shopping
centre and the parties came to stand in a direct relationship with each other.
ANZ Leasing (NSW) Pty Ltd was formerly the first defendant
but the proceedings
against it have been discontinued. Perpetual holds as trustee for the General
Property Trust.  Actual management
of the shopping centre has been in the hands
of various companies in the Lend Lease Group throughout; at the time of the
relevant
events this year the manager traded as Lend Lease Retail, its full
name being Lend Lease Property Management (Australia) Pty Ltd.
 The plaintiff's
direct dealings were with Lend Lease Retail.
<P>

2  	The plaintiff's principal claim is for a declaration that a new
lease was entered into between the plaintiff and Perpetual to
commence on 4
April 1999 for a period of five years.  No formal or registrable lease has been
granted and the claim must be understood
as a claim for an equitable lease or a
contractual entitlement to the grant of a lease.  The plaintiff also sought
specific performance
and made ancillary claims including claims relating to a
caveat.  The defendant cross-claimed for a declaration establishing its
entitlement to possession and for a number of orders under which it would
recover possession, damages and mesne profits.  On 20 January
1999 the
plaintiff made a written arrangement with Lend Lease Retail - Document 16 in
Exhibit 1 - and the decision of the case turns
on whether that arrangement
constituted an agreement for the grant of a lease and, if it did, whether a
condition contained in it
has been fulfilled.
<P>

3  	In the evidence the history of the parties' negotiations both
before and after that document was traversed extensively and the
context of the
parties' dealings into which the document fits was well established.  The
significant issues in the case appear to
me to have turn on an understanding of
expressions within the letter itself as a matter of ordinary English.  
<P>

4  	On each of the two earlier occasions when the plaintiff obtained
a lease there had been a process in which there had first been
a formal letter
of offer on which a written acceptance was endorsed, then a Deed of Agreement
to Lease of later date, then a lease
in registrable form granted still later.
In 1994 during the term of the sublease the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act 1994</a> came into
effect and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.11</a> imposed formal and procedural requirements on a lessor in
relation to formation of a retail shop lease, while <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.8</a> created presumptions
about the time at which a retail shop lease is considered to have been entered
into for the purpose of that
Act. 
<P>

5  	On 10 December 1998 Mr Jimmy Tai on behalf of the plaintiff wrote
to Lend Lease Retail asking to commence talks to renew his
shop lease.  On 14
December Lend Lease replied, saying that they looked forward "... to contacting
you in the near future to discuss
the possibility of a new lease" and they also
asked to view the plaintiff's business plan.  The plaintiff sent another letter
on
16 December and on 6 January 1999 Lend Lease Retail sent Mr Tai a letter
relating to discussing the opportunity of a new lease. 
This letter sets out in
considerable detail terms for a new lease.  The plaintiff replied on 14 January
saying that he found the
terms and conditions difficult to meet and asking for
discussion.  There was some discussion on 20 January between Mr Tai and Ms
Katherine Weir, the Retail Manager of Lend Lease Retail at Charlestown.  At
this meeting Ms Weir modified the letter of 6 January
1999 to make several
significant changes in response to the discussion.  The letter was reprinted
although by oversight the date
was not altered and still appeared to be 6
January 1999.  Mr Tai signed and dated the endorsement on the letter there and
then and
gave it back to Ms Weir. 
<P>

6  	Thereafter some discussions continued between Mr Tai and Ms Weir,
and also with Mr Bowden, Ms Weir's superior officer.  In these
discussions Mr
Tai sought to obtain agreement to reduce the rent, but Lend Lease Retail did
not agree.  On 4 March 1999 Lend Lease
Retail wrote to Mr Tai stating
"Subsequent to discussions for a renewal of this lease, the lessor has
concluded from both recent
research and recent and past history of this store
that a renewal is not appropriate" and called for possession on 3 July 1999.
The
plaintiff did not give possession and commenced these proceedings on 18 May
1999.  They have been heard with expedition.
<P>

7  	The terms of the letter of 20 January 1999 must be taken as a
whole and my reasons for judgment largely turn on commentary on
it; a copy of
the letter is a schedule to these reasons.  The context of fact is of
assistance because it shows what the existing
relationship was and shows that
the agent and the plaintiff had proceeded through a formal Letter of Offer to
an agreement for lease
on earlier occasions, and also shows that the earlier
leases had been complex documents, as is only to be expected of a lease for
some years of commercial premises.  The factual setting does not establish any
unusual practices or special meanings of terms used
in the letter.
<P>

8  	Disputes about whether negotiations for a lease for commercial
premises have reached the stage of a binding contract come before
this Division
quite often, and it is a recurring source of difficulty to know at what point
the parties intended to be contractually
bound when they first discussed and
came to agreement on the most important aspects of a contemplated leasehold
relationship and
then turned to preparing a formal document dealing with the
whole subject, with much fuller expression and in registrable form. 
The
difficulty is formalised in the classification in the judgment of Dixon CJ
McTiernan and Kitto JJ in Masters v Cameron <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1954/72.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1954] HCA 72</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281954%29%2091%20CLR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1954) 91 CLR 353</a> at 360; the
plaintiff contended that the agreement made by this letter falls within the
first class - "... <i>the parties have reached finality in arranging all the
terms of their bargain and intend to be immediately bound to the performance
of
those terms, but at the same time propose to have the terms restated in a form
which will be fuller or more precise but not different
in effect."</i>  If I
accepted the defendant's submissions I would place the agreement in the third
class: "... <i>one in which the intention of the parties is not to make a
concluded bargain at all, unless and until they execute a formal contract."
</i>The defendant's submissions were not directed to establishing any
particular classification other than to excluding the arrangement
from the
first class.  In <b>Dellwest Pty Ltd v Cafabe Pty Ltd</b> (Bryson J) Unreported
26 November 1997, p7 I said: "Counsel referred me to Arjay Investments Pty Ltd
v Morrison's Outdoor Catering
Pty Ltd (Young J 1 May 1995 unreported) at p4 and
p5 where his Honour set out guidelines to assist in coming to a conclusion as
to
whether there is a binding agreement arising out of commercial
correspondence.  The dominance of the facts of the present case is
such that,
in my opinion, guidelines and normal expectations are of little value.  Judges
of the Equity Division have, I think it
is right to say, approached allegations
that there has been an agreement to grant a commercial lease with the knowledge
that commercial
practice is that a binding relationship is made at the point of
execution and delivery of the lease.  However that is no more than
an approach,
as it is quite open to persons in negotiation for a commercial lease to proceed
as they choose and to make an agreement
for lease in an informal way, by
correspondence or orally; if they do come to an agreement in that way the Court
must recognise that
this is so and act on their agreement."  See too <b>Arjay
Investments Pty Ltd v Morrisson's Outdoor Catering Pty Ltd</b> (Young J)
Unreported 1 May 1995 at p4.  There is considerable gulf between taking this
approach and reaching a conclusion on the
facts of any particular case, as the
conclusion must be dominated by those facts.
<P>

9  	The arrangement of 20 January 1999 at some places uses language
appropriate to the formation of a binding agreement.  Indications
in support of
that view are the reference to the essential terms required and their
enumeration, as these references support an understanding
that what was
essential was established by the letter.  It must be said that they also show
that other terms are required.  The conclusion
that there was contractual
finality is also supported by some other language used: references to
acceptance, to the letter as "This
offer" and its formality of expression,
particularly in the third last and second last paragraphs.  Formality and
finality are also
indicated by the terms of the endorsement, in which the
preceding passages are referred to as "The offer as set out above".
<P>

10  	However there are many other indications.  One is the
contemplation that there will be a later document, a formal Letter of
Offer.
This expression can be seen as pointing each way; its description as a letter
of offer is an indication that the offer susceptible
of acceptance and contract
formation is still to come; the reference to it as formal is an indication that
it is to be a matter of
form and that the substance is elsewhere, perhaps in
the present letter.  It should be said however that a formal Letter of Offer
is
an opportunity for compliance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.11</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rla1994135/" class="autolink_findacts">Retail Leases Act</a>, such as
retail lessors acting reasonably would wish to make.  
<P>

11  	Overall the meaning and effect of the letter are established by
some passages which I regard as of the first significance in
explaining what
was thereby intended.  The opening words of the second paragraph are "<i>We
wish to discuss the opportunity of a new lease  for this tenancy, the essential
terms required would be as follows</i>: <i>..." </i>(and a number of terms
follow).  To my mind this places the essential terms in the subject under
discussion as something which Lend
Lease Retail would require in a new lease,
not as establishing everything significant which was to be in the new lease.
The new lease
was an opportunity which was to be discussed, not something which
was to be brought about forthwith.  Then in the third last paragraph
there is
again reference to discussion, and it is plain that the discussion is not to be
brought to an end with the letter or with
the acceptance, as there are to be
other conditions.  The references to discussion and to an opportunity appear to
me to establish
that the letter was not intended to be an offer capable of
immediate acceptance, but to be the opening, on a fairly concrete basis,
of
negotiations.  The plenitude of statement of Lend Lease Retail's position does
not obliterate the indication that what is sought
is discussion, not finality.

<P>

12  	The two conditions referred to in the opening sentence of the
third last paragraph - "subject to owner approval" and "subject
to the
provision of a formal letter of offer" - are further indications that there is
not to be finality with the plaintiff's acceptance,
or indeed with discussion.
The terms of the acceptance which Mr Tai signed again refer to the formal
Letter of Offer.  
<P>

13  	The nature of the invitation to discuss an opportunity, and the
nature of a number of what are referred to as essential terms
appear to me to
show that the formal Letter of Offer which is contemplated for the future is
not to be limited to a formulation or
more careful statement of matters which
have already been agreed, but is to go further.  Some of the things referred to
as essential
terms are highly concrete and not capable to much more
restatement; those relating to commencement, identification, area and lease
term.  However the words used to establish the base rental and the provision
relating to the outgoings are capable of much fuller
statement and it seems
unlikely that a full and exhaustive definition of the parties' rights could
have been intended to be made
by the words used.  I make the same observation
of the provision relating to rent reviews.  There is room for many different
formulations
of clauses establishing what the base rental was to be and how it
was to be adjusted at rental reviews.  There is also room for many
different
formulations of what the provisions about outgoings were to say in detail, what
obligations they were to impose on the
parties, and what was involved in the
note saying "<i>Outgoings items are audited, reviewed and adjusted
annually</i>".  The processes of audit review and adjustment need much fuller
statement before they could be understood and enforced.
<P>

14  	Term 9 - "<i>Full refit of the premises</i>" is highly
indeterminate, and no provisions establishing what was meant by full refit of
the premises were established by the oral
negotiations.  There was much more
which needed to be established before what was acquired for the refit could be
defined.
<P>

15  	The same is true of term 10 - "<i>The Lessor requires a review
of operational standards."</i>  It is left indeterminate what this review is to
be, when and how it is to take place, and what is to be the outcome.  It could
well
be among the things to which owner approval is to relate.
<P>

16  	These observations, and a general understanding of the
complexity of commercial leases lead me to conclude that it was intended
that
there should be a wide range of latitude in the preparation of the contemplated
letter of offer, and it was intended that the
lessor was to be at liberty to
choose what the terms of its letter of offer were to be, while the lessee was
to be at liberty to
choose whether or not it would accept what the letter was
to say.  It is not proper view of the letter of 20 January that it shows
that
the preparation of a formal Letter of Offer was to be a mere formality, or an
expression in better form of what was already
established.
<P>

17  	An altogether predominant consideration is that the acceptance
and discussion of the offer was stated to be "<i>subject to owner
approval</i>".  In my view those words show, as a clear matter of expression
and according to the ordinary meaning of language, that unless there
was owner
approval, which was still to take place, the offer, the plaintiff's acceptance,
the discussion and all the arrangements
were not to have effect.  In what I
regard as plain language Lend Lease Retail reserved to the owner the
opportunity to state that
it approved, or did not approve of what had been
arranged.  
<P>

18  	I do not accept the contention that the reference to the owner's
approval was a formality, or another contention which appeared
to mean that,
because of the extent to which authority had been delegated to Lend Lease
Retail (and that authority extended to giving
such an approval in this case),
the owner's approval was a formality or foregone conclusion.  Whether owner
approval was to be given
by the owner itself or was to be given by Lend Lease
Retail under delegated authority, there was a need that it should be given and
the opportunity to do so was reserved.  There is no evidence that it was ever
given and the letter of 4 March 1999 shows in a clear
way that it was refused.

<P>

19  	The plaintiff's counsel contended that the defendant is subject
to an obligation to act reasonably and in good faith in granting
or withholding
approval.  In support of this contention he referred me to a number of
authorities which dealt with situations in
which approval by someone
representing one party such as that party's solicitor was required for a lease
or other document to which
the parties had agreed.  The references began with
the decision of Fry J in <b>Hudson v Buck</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281877%29%207%20Ch%20D%20683" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1877) 7 Ch D 683</a>; his Lordship's
observations at 687 show the view that approval or disapproval was required to
be given in good faith and reasonably.
 I was also referred to <b>Marten v
Whale</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1917%5d%202%20KB%20480" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1917] 2 KB 480</a>, <b>Caney v Leith</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1937%5d%202%20All%20ER%20532" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1937] 2 All ER 532</a> and <b>Peet
&amp; Co. Ltd v Rocci</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20WAR%20164" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] W.A.R. 164.</a>  In various ways these cases
illustrate that there is a good faith requirement where the parties have made a
contractual arrangement
and for that arrangement to be carried out there is a
need for a lease or other document to be prepared and approved.  I distinguish
the principle in those cases from cases such as this where approval relates to
contract formation and not to the carrying out of
some contractual obligation
which has already been made; in relation to contract formation a party is at
liberty to act according
to its own concept of its interests, and even to act
unreasonably.
<P>

20  	If the position were that the owner's approval was subject to a
good faith requirement, ample grounds objectively existed for
a decision to
withhold approval, as Lend Lease Retail had received an expression of interest
from another prospective tenant who
was regarded as more satisfactory
commercially and otherwise, and there were objectively strong grounds for not
wishing to continue
in a contractual relationship with the plaintiff having
regard to false statements which had been made over a long period by the
plaintiff in returns of its turnover which it was required to furnish under the
sublease.  Further the plaintiff's business had been
the subject of inspections
and adverse observations by Municipal Health Inspectors, and of customer
complaints which had become known
to Lend Lease Retail.  In the presence of
reasonable grounds for electing not to deal further with the plaintiff it could
not be
said that, if a test of good faith and reasonableness had applied, the
defendant had not complied with it.
<P>

21  	In my finding the defendant has no contractual obligation to
grant a lease such as is alleged and the plaintiff should not
succeed.
<P>

22  	Lend Lease Retail on behalf of the defendant gave the plaintiff
permission to remain in occupation after expiry until 4 July,
but since that
date the plaintiff's possession of the premises has been unlawful.  The
defendant is entitled to a declaration as
cross-claimed establishing its
interest, and to judgment for possession.
<P>

23  	I make the following orders:
<P>

1.	The plaintiff's proceedings are dismissed with costs.
<P>

2.	On the Cross-claim I make declaration 1 as claimed in the Cross-claim.
<P>

3.	I give judgment for Perpetual Trustee Co. Ltd for possession.
<P>

4.	I give leave to issue a writ of possession.
<P>

5.	The whole of the Cross-claimant's claims for damages and mesne profits and
interest, and for costs in relation thereto, are referred
to a Master of this
Court for determination.
<P>

<center>6.	I order that the Cross-defendants pay the cross-claimant's costs of
the Cross-claim, other than costs in relation to the claims
which have been
referred to a Master.
