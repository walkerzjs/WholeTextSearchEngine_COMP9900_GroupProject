<b>1443/99	AMP GENERAL INSURANCE LTD V SONYA VINITA PRASAD &amp; 1 ORS</b>
<P>

 
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	</b>(Objection to filing and reading of affidavits; see p1 of
transcript)
<P>

 
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  
<P>

1	Objection is taken on behalf of the defendants, Sonya Vinita Prasad and Jesse
Milford, to the filing and reading of their longer
affidavits sworn today, on
the ground that the evidence may tend to prove that each of them has committed
an offence against Australian
Law.  Those affidavits have been sworn and
brought into Court to comply with my order made 23 March 1999.  The objection
is supported
by their shorter affidavits sworn today.  Although the longer
affidavits are not yet filed or read, I have examined them for the
purpose of
determining whether there are reasonable grounds for those objections, and I
find that there are reasonable grounds for
the objections.
<P>

2	The next question that arises is the question of whether or not I ought,
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128(5)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>, require the witnesses to give the
evidence.  Mr C B Simpson, of counsel for the defendants, opposes my requiring
the witnesses to
give the evidence.  He is entitled to do this because my
earlier order was only that affidavits be created and brought into Court,
not
that they be read.  The defendants have complied with my earlier order by
swearing the affidavits and bringing them into Court.
 However, the grounds on
which Mr Simpson takes that objection are the same grounds as those on which he
objected to my making the
earlier order for the affidavits to be created and
brought into Court.  It is not a foregone conclusion that I should now order
the
affidavits to be read, simply because they have been created and brought
into Court.  There may be circumstances where the material
that appears in the
affidavits would cause the Court to decide not to order their reading, and to
hand them back for destruction
in accordance with the procedure envisaged at
the time the earlier order was made.  That may arise from material in the
affidavits
themselves or from other events which have supervened between the
earlier order and now.  However, in this particular case there
is nothing, to
my mind, that changes the considerations which led me to make the earlier
order.  The matters that were in my mind
at the time of my making that order,
and which are set out in my earlier reasons for judgment, lead me to the
conclusion that the
interests of justice require that the witnesses give the
evidence, and I require the witnesses to give the evidence.  The particular
form that that requirement will take is as follows.
<P>

3	I grant leave to the defendants to file in Court the affidavit of S V Prasad
sworn 31 March 1999 and the  affidavit of J Milford
sworn 31 March 1999 (the
longer affidavits).  I direct that those affidavits be read in Court.  I note
that those affidavits are
now read in Court without objection.  By reason of
the fact that this course has been taken, I am required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128(6)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> to give to those witnesses a certificate under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> in respect of
that evidence.  I direct that the originals of those affidavits remain on the
Court file, but that they be placed in
a sealed envelope on which the contents
are identified, and I direct that that envelope not be opened without the leave
of a Judge
of this Court.  I dispense with the requirement to serve copies of
the affidavits on the plaintiff.  However, in doing that, I indicate
that I
shall direct service of the affidavits upon the plaintiff after the defendants
put to me any submissions that they are minded
to put concerning any
restriction as to the handling of and access to the copy affidavits when
served.
<P>

4	The course I have followed is to direct that the affidavits be read in Court.
This was the course envisaged by Young J in <b>HPM Industries Pty Ltd v
Graham</b>, 17 July 1996, NSWSC, unreported, by myself in <b>National Australia
Bank Limited v Rusu</b>, 6 April 1998, NSWSC, unreported, and by Hodgson CJ in
Eq in this case on 8 March 1999, and is the course envisaged in my earlier
reasons for judgment in this case:   <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/252.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 252.</a>  When the affidavits were
brought into Court in the <b>HPM Industries</b> case, Young J decided that a
certificate under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> applied only to oral evidence and
accordingly directed that the evidence be given orally, or at least by written
statement verified
by the witness in the witness box:  <b>HPM Industries Pty
Ltd v Graham (No 2), </b>28 August 1996, NSWSC, unreported.  With respect, I
agree with his Honour's first view rather than his second, as to whether <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a>
applies to affidavit evidence.  The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> is silent as to the giving of
evidence in chief at trials by affidavit, perhaps strangely, in that, certainly
now (and, indeed, by
1995), evidence in chief is given at almost all trials, at
least in this Division, by affidavit, and the same is substantially so
in the
Federal Court of Australia.  However, because this practice subsisted at the
time of the Act, in my view the Act must be taken
to contemplate the giving of
evidence in this fashion, and it is also my view that the reading of the
affidavits is the most convenient
course in this case.
