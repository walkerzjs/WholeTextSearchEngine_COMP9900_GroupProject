070031/99	<b>REGINA   v   LMW</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

(On application concerning the proposed evidence of BWI)
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The Crown has made application for the following
orders:
<P>

<i>"3.	That the evidence (including the cross examination) of the witness known
under the pseudonym of `BWI' be given in closed Court
to which members of the
public and the media shall be denied access except -</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	legal representatives of the accused and the Crown;</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	support persons for the witness `BWI'</i>
<P>

<i>4.	That publication of the evidence given by the witness `BWI' be prohibited
except as between the Crown, the accused, and his legal
representatives."</i>
<P>

2  	The application has been supported by the following affidavit
evidence:
<P>

(i)	the affidavit of Siobhan Herbert;
<P>

(ii)	the affidavit of Susan Blacker.
<P>

3  	Mr Blackburn, appearing in the interests of television networks,
was given leave to appear to oppose the application.
<P>

4  	Before considering the evidence, it is appropriate to state
important matters of principle.  
<P>

5  	There is a very important public interest in the open
administration of justice, and it is only in exceptional circumstances
that
this court should accede to an application such as that which the Crown now
makes:  see, generally, <i>John Fairfax &amp; Sons Limited v Police Tribunal of
New South Wales</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 465</a>, and in particular the judgment of
McHugh JA at 476-477; <i>David Syme &amp; Co Limited v General Motors Holdens
Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%202%20NSWLR%20294" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 2 NSWLR 294</a>, and in particular the judgment of Samuels JA at
310; <i>Raybos Australia Pty Limited v Jones</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20NSWLR%2047" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2 NSWLR 47</a> at 52-54;
<i>R v Richards &amp; Anor</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/114.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCCA 114.</a>
<P>

6  	In <i>Richards </i>the Chief Justice said at paras 37-39:
<P>

<i>"37.	The public interest in the open administration of justice has
frequently been reiterated. The paramount duty of the courts in
administering
justice according to law is to ensure that justice is done. All else is
subservient to the discharge of this duty.
In the ordinary course, court
proceedings are conducted in public and exposed to the catharctic glare of
publicity. Publicity of
proceedings is one of the great protections against the
exercise of arbitrary power and a reassurance that justice is administered
fairly and impartially. As Lord Hewart put it in R v Sussex Justices; Ex parte
McCarthy  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1924%5d%201%20KB%20256" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1924] 1 KB 256</a>, `Justice must not only be done but be seen to be
done'.</i>
<P>

<i>38.	The courts should be open to all, so that anyone who wishes may see how
justice is done. The privilege belongs to the public generally
and no special
privilege is conferred on those who report proceedings. In this regard I refer
to the observations of Samuels JA in
the case of David Syme &amp; Co Limited v
General Motors Holden Limited  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%202%20NSWLR%20294" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 2 NSWLR 294</a> at 310 where his Honour
said:</i>
<P>

<i>	`It is well established that in the ordinary course the courts will conduct
their proceedings in public. It is fundamental that the
courts should be open
to all, in order that all who are minded to do so may see how justice is
administered...that entitlement is
not limited to those who have business in
the courts as litigants; nor, I myself would add, does it confer any special
privilege
upon those who report proceedings for the press or electronic media.
The privilege to see what the courts do and say belongs to the
public
generally'.</i>
<P>

<i>39.	It is only in wholly exceptional circumstances, where the presence of
the public or public knowledge of the proceedings is likely
to defeat the
paramount duty of the courts, that the courts may proceed in camera."</i>
<P>

7  	I must heed the principles stated in the cases to which I have
referred when considering the present application.  However,
I would add that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
10(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987</a></i> contemplates that
where criminal proceedings relate to a child the media is nevertheless
<i>"entitled to enter or remain"</i> in court, <i>"unless the court otherwise
directs"</i>.  The court should only <i>"otherwise direct"</i> in accordance
with the principles in the general law to which I have already made
reference.
<P>

8  	What then are the wholly exceptional circumstances which would
warrant the making of the orders sought by the Crown and which
Mr Zahra, on
behalf of the accused, does not oppose?
<P>

9  	The witness to whom the application relates was seven years of
age when earlier this year he gave evidence at the committal
proceedings
concerning the drowning of the deceased.  Susan Blacker is a psychologist who,
according to her affidavit, has attended
at several conferences with this
witness and his mother.  The most recent of these conferences appears to have
been on 4 November
1999.  Miss Blacker's assessment on that occasion was that
the young child was extremely agitated and defiant <i>"to the point of being
uncontrollable"</i>.  He said he would not go to court and that Miss Blacker
could not make him go.  Miss Blacker recorded in the notes to her affidavit:
<P>

<i>"[BWI's] general health again gave me cause for concern, today.  He appears
increasingly pale and thin and has a physical appearance
like that seen in
failure to thrive children.  During the last few weeks I noticed a stutter
developing in [BWI's] speech and today
[BWI] seemed unable to speak without
stuttering most words.  During a very brief period of work of not more than
five minutes I asked
[BWI] some questions about what he thought and felt today
about going to court as a witness.  During this mostly one sided discussion,
[BWI] had several brief episodes of about thirty seconds each, resembling Petit
Mal epileptic seizures in quick succession and very
shortly after these
episodes he began to fall asleep.  Extreme tiredness to the point of exhaustion
and sleep after an episode may
be seen in sufferers of epilepsy."</i>
<P>

10  	The opinion which the psychologist expressed in paras 10 and 11
of the notes attached to her affidavit was in these terms:
<P>

<i>"10.	Given [BWI's] behaviour today and fragile health especially when placed
in any stressful situation I seriously doubt his ability
to give evidence in
any effective manner.  If [the boy's father] could be persuaded to support
[BWI] attending court, even if he
did not agree with the process, then [BWI's]
effectiveness as a witness may be improved. [The boy's father] may benefit from
hearing
information about ways in which this Office and the court are
attempting to support [BWI] as a witness and protect him from exposure
to the
media.</i>
<P>

<i>11.	In this very difficult matter, [BWI] is required to give evidence about
what has been, for a young child, a very traumatic experience
with very
traumatic memories.  Given the current conflict in [BWI's] family about him
being a witness and lack of support from his
father for attending court, [BWI]
will continue to struggle as a witness.  Under these circumstances, there is a
very real possibility
that [BWI's] wellbeing may be further damaged and his
currently rather fragile health may further deteriorate should he be required
to give evidence in this matter."</i>
<P>

11  	Miss Herbert, as the solicitor with the conduct of this matter
in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, has deposed
that she was
present at a conference with the Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor when he spoke
with the father of the witness and overheard
the utterances of the father of
the witness, who said:  <i>"[BWI] won't be attending, mate...  He's had
nightmares about this and about this stuff.  It's too much for him.  It's too
much for
him."</i>  Later, it seems in another telephone conversation that same
day, the boy's father agreed to attend a conference with counsel on
8 November
1999 but did not do so.  The Crown informed this Court however that it is
expected that the young child will give evidence
when required.  However, it
was submitted that the giving of that evidence would be facilitated if it is
given in closed court and
in circumstances in which the media is excluded.
Hence the current application.
<P>

12  	I readily accept, as the affidavit evidence indicates, that for
this child the experience of giving evidence at the committal
proceedings was
an ordeal.  The evidence was given after the presiding magistrate had made
orders prohibiting the reporting of his
name or anything that identified him.
Notwithstanding such orders there was extensive media publicity and in the
course of a television
programme the child was seen walking, albeit with his
face pixilated.  According to Miss Herbert she was informed that the child
was
recognised by a significant number of people.  Moreover, his evidence was
followed by two items in a newspaper and the author
of each item was critical,
indeed highly critical, of the manner in which the evidence had been given.
<P>

13  	In essence then the Crown submits that the evidence of this
witness should be given in closed court and in the absence of the
media because
of the manner in which the child was treated when he last gave evidence and
because of the concern of his parents prompting
their lack of co-operation and
encouragement for him to assist the Crown.  
<P>

14  	For his part, Mr Zahra has informed the Court that he wishes
that this child should give evidence and he therefore supports
the application
since the orders sought would encourage the child to give evidence and to
facilitate his doing so.
<P>

15  	On the other hand, Mr Blackburn has argued that the evidence
falls short of establishing the sort of exceptional circumstances
which would
warrant the making of the orders the Crown seeks.  Significantly, he submitted,
there is no affidavit evidence before
this Court from either the mother or the
father of the witness.  
<P>

16  	I have reflected on the competing submissions overnight.  If I
was persuaded that the practical consequence of a refusal to
make the orders
sought would be that efforts to have the child give evidence would be
frustrated or that the quality of his evidence
would be affected by his giving
the evidence in the absence of such orders, the application may well have had a
different outcome.
 However, on the evidence before me, I am not persuaded on
either point.
<P>

17  	As I have observed, the Crown has informed the Court that it is
expected that the witness will be available to give evidence
when called.  It
is not contemplated that this young child will give evidence in the courtroom
in which this trial is being conducted.
 On the contrary, it is proposed that
his evidence will be taken from a room removed from this court complex and will
be heard and
seen by videolink.  I have already made orders that this child not
be identified by name and that this child should not otherwise
be identified by
any visual means.  Whilst I do not make light of the stresses which giving
evidence will place upon the witness
in the circumstances in which it is
intended that it be given, it seems to me that such stresses ought to be
significantly less than
they would have been if he was required to give
evidence in this courtroom.
<P>

18  	In the course of the application the Crown has been critical of
the conduct of certain of the media in contributing to the
distress of the
witness at the time of and consequent upon the committal proceedings.  However,
I do not approach this application
upon the basis that the media are going to
be irresponsible in the discharge of their duties at this trial.
<P>

19  	The Crown referred to evidence in the affidavit of Miss Herbert
as to the way in which the witness seemingly acted at the committal
proceedings
<i>"in an undisciplined, mirthful and disruptive manner"</i>.  The evidence
indicates that the public gallery of the courtroom was occupied by journalists
who responded to the behaviour of the
witness with laughter and seemed
therefore to encourage the child.  Whether that be so or not, I do not
anticipate that there would
be a repetition of any such behaviour by any member
of the audience at this trial.  That simply would not be allowed to occur.  In
saying that, I am not for one moment implying any criticism of the conduct of
the learned magistrate of the committal proceedings.
<P>

20  	It is also relevant that in the manner in which the witness will
give evidence by videolink his view of the courtroom will
be limited.  He will
not see the accused.  He will see the judge and he will see counsel, but he
will not see any journalists who
are in court because they will be out of the
view of the camera.
<P>

21  	I referred earlier to the conclusions expressed by Miss Blacker,
in which she recorded the serious doubt she entertained as
to the child's
ability to give evidence in any effective manner.  However, as the evidence in
support of this application stands,
and in the absence of any expert evidence
to this effect, I do not conclude that the child's ability to give evidence by
video in
the circumstances that are contemplated would be any less than his
ability to give evidence in circumstances where the media has
been denied
access to the courtroom.  
<P>

22  	In my opinion exceptional circumstances such as would warrant
the exclusion of the media from the courtroom whilst the child's
evidence is
being given have not been established and I decline to make the orders sought
in paras 3 and 4 of the Crown's application.
<P>

23  	The orders that I made earlier however under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/s10.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 10</a> and 11 of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987</a></i> of course remain in force to
the extent that those orders concern the child the subject of the Crown's
application.  His name is
not to be published or broadcast at any time.  There
is to be no publication or broadcast of any information, any picture, any
drawing
or other material which either identifies the child or which is likely
to lead to his identification.
