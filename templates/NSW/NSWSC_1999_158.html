<P>

<b>50062/98	HIH CASUALTY AND GENERAL INSURANCE LTD  v  THE MEADOWS INDEMNITY CO
LTD </b>
<P>

<b><u>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	In these proceedings, the plaintiff, HIH Casualty and General Insurance Ltd,
formally known as CE Heath Casualty &amp; General
Insurance Ltd (Heath), seeks
damages in the sum of $1,114,666.03 under quota share reinsurance agreements
(the agreement) in respect
of professional indemnity policies for the periods 1
April 1989 to 31 March 1990 (the first policy year) and 1 April 1990 to 31
March
1991 (the second policy year).  It is alleged that the agreement in
respect of the first policy year was for a quota share of five
per cent of
$5,000,000 any one policy any one risk in excess of $5,000,000 any one policy
any one risk and that the agreement in
relation to the second policy year was
for 7.5 per cent.
<P>

2	In the summary of Heath's contentions in the summons (the contentions), it is
alleged as follows in respect of the first policy
year:
<P>

"C2.	The following claims and expenses in excess of $5m were incurred and paid
by the Plaintiff in respect of policies commencing
during that period.
<P>

<b>Policy No		Insured			Claim and Expenses</b>
<P>

<b>								Amount (Excess $5m)</b>
<P>

9PNK2813	ASA Day Neilson	$11,712,500.00
<P>

C3.	The Defendant's share of those losses is 5% of $11,712,500.00 ie
$585,625.00"
<P>

3	It is further alleged in the contentions in respect of the second policy year
as follows:
<P>

		"C6.	The following claims and expenses in excess of $5m were incurred and
paid by the Plaintiff in respect of policies commencing
during that period.
<P>

<b>Policy No.      	Insured		       Claim and Expenses</b>
<P>

<b>							      Amount (excess $5m)</b>
<P>

90PNK4184	Freehills 		$1,239,045.00
<P>

90PNK4203	Priestley Morris 		$5,814,835.41
<P>

	
<P>

	
<P>

		C15.	The Defendant's share of those losses is 7.5% of $7,053,880.41 ie
$529,041.03"
<P>

4	In its defence, the defendant, The Meadows Indemnity Co Ltd (Meadows), denies
the allegations in paragraphs C3 and C15 of the
contentions and does not admit
the allegations in paragraphs C2 and C6.  Nor does Meadows admit the terms of
the agreement.  Meadows
asserts, however, that if the terms are those relied
upon by Heath, then the agreement in respect of the first policy year limited
its share of the reinsurance to $250,000 calculated at five per cent of
$5,000,000 and, in respect of the second policy year, to
$375,000 calculated at
7.5 per cent of $5,000,000.  It denies that the agreement called for the
payment of legal costs and expenses
in addition to those limits.  While Meadows
admits that it has not paid the claims made upon it by Heath, it denies any
obligation
to pay those claims.  That is a bare denial without any matter
pleaded in support of it.
<P>

5	In purported answer to the whole of the claim, Meadows asserts that if the
terms of the agreement were as alleged by Heath, then
Heath was in breach of
article VIII of those terms which gave rise to an equitable set-off in respect
of damages for that alleged
breach.  Meadows further asserts that by reason of
the terms of article XVIII, the parties were required to submit disputes under
the agreement to arbitration by reason whereof it is alleged that the
"commencement of these proceedings is barred by reason that
the plaintiff is
not entitled to bring or maintain these proceedings".  
<P>

6	Article VIII was in the following terms:
<P>

		"<u>LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES</u>:
<P>

		The Company will settle all losses incurred under its Policies and such
settlements shall 		be binding on the Reinsurer in proportion
to its
participation in this Agreement.  In 		addition, the Reinsurer will be liable
for its pro-rata share of expenses incurred
by the 		Company in connection with
such losses.  The Reinsurer is entitled to, and will be paid 		or credited
with, any amounts
the Company recovers as salvage.  The Reinsurer agrees 		to
reimburse the Company, promptly, when so requested by the Company for
losses
paid by the Company.  Requests for such reimbursement must be accompanied by an
	executed reinsurance proof of loss.  Alternatively
losses shall be handled in
the 			quarterly accounts and need not be individually reported.
<P>

		It is understood that, when so requested, the Company will afford the
Reinsurer an 		opportunity to be associated with the Company,
at the expenses
of the Reinsurer, in 		the defense or control of any claim or suit or
proceeding involving this reinsurance, 		and
the Company and the Reinsurer
shall cooperate in every respect in the defense of 		such claim or suit or
proceeding.
<P>

		Nothing in this Article shall be construed as meaning that losses are not
recoverable 		hereunder until the loss to the Company
has been ascertained.
<P>

		The date of loss as defined in the Company's original insurance policies
shall apply as 		respects loss under this Agreement,
and the Company shall be
the sole judge of what 		shall constitute the date of loss."
<P>

7	Article XVIII provided as follows:
<P>

		"<u>ARBITRATION</u>:
<P>

		Disputes arising out of this Agreement or concerning its validity shall be
submitted to 		the decision of a Court of Arbitration,
consisting of three
members, which shall meet in 		Australia."
<P>

8	In respect of the claimed equitable set-off, no damages are specified, no
cross-claim is pleaded and no particulars are provided
by which any such
damages could be quantified. 
<P>

9	There are two motions before me.  One by Meadows seeks orders that the
proceedings be summarily dismissed and, in the alternative,
that they be stayed
until the matters in dispute have been arbitrated pursuant to article XVIII.
It is only the latter order which
is pressed.
<P>

10	Heath's motion seeks orders as follows:
<P>

   "2.	An order that the Plaintiff have leave to enter Judgment against the
Defendant for part of the claim in the amounts of:
<P>

	...
<P>

			(b)    $375,000.00 in respect of the claim but not expense relating to
Priestley 			and Morris for the period 1 April 1990 to
31 March 1991 and
interest thereon.
<P>

			without prejudice to the Plaintiff's right to proceed with the balance of
the 			claim.
<P>

			
<P>

			3. 	Alternatively, an order that paragraph 5 of the Defence be struck
out.
<P>

			4. 	Alternatively to Paragraphs 2 and 3, an order that the 	following
questions be determined separately under Part 31 of the
Rules before any trial
	or further trial in the proceedings:
<P>

				(a) 	whether the Defendant is party to contracts for reinsurance 				with
the Plaintiff for each of the years ended 21 March
1990 and 31 				March 1991,
and if so, under what terms;
<P>

				(b) 	whether under the terms of the contract or contracts 					identified
in answer to (a) above, the Plaintiff is entitled
to indemnity 				from the
defendant for:
<P>

					(i) 	$375,500.00 in respect of the claims relating to ASA 					Day Nielson
referred to paragraph C2 of the Summons.
<P>

					(ii) 	$357,000.00 in respect of the claims relating to 					Priestley and
Morris referred to in paragraph C6 of the
<P>

					Summons.
<P>

					(iii) 	$93,399.00 in respect of the claims relating to 						Freehill
Hollingdale and Page.
<P>

					(iv) 	the expenses relating to ASA Day Nielson and 					Priestley and
Morris referred to in paragraphs C2 and C6 of 					the
Summons."
<P>

11	Order 2(a), which sought summary judgment in the sum of $357,500 under the
agreement in respect of the first policy year, was
not pressed.
<P>

12	Meadows' defence and application have been filed by Meadows without
prejudice to its challenge to the jurisdiction of this Court
to determine these
proceedings.  That challenge is the subject of a decision by Rolfe J of 16
December 1998 (Rolfe J's judgment).
 In that judgment Rolfe J dismissed
Meadows' application that the summons be set aside for want of jurisdiction or
that the Court
should decline to exercise jurisdiction on discretionary bases.
Meadows has applied for leave to appeal against Rolfe J's judgment.
<P>

13	Much of the material which was before Rolfe J in that application has been
re-tendered in the applications before me.  In particular,
Heath read the
affidavit of Meadows' solicitor, Dale James Kemp, sworn 25 September 1998
(Kemp's affidavit) as to paragraphs 1 to
34, while the balance of Kemp's
affidavit was read by Meadows.  That balance of Kemp's affidavit was objected
to by counsel on behalf
of Heath on the ground of relevance.  I deferred ruling
on that ground in the interest of expedition.  In my view, the material is
relevant to the bases of defence relied upon by Meadows.  
<P>

14	The affidavit of Gregory Ernest Brown, sworn 17 November 1998 was admitted
into evidence before Rolfe J and, before me, Heath
read paragraphs 1 to 5, 7 to
10 and 12 to 29.  
<P>

15	In my view, Meadows' application is without substance and should be
dismissed.  It is founded upon reliance on the terms of article
XVIII of the
agreement, a term it does not admit it is bound by.  As a consequence, Meadows
does not admit that it is a party to
any submission to arbitration.  
<P>

16	Consistently with that stance, there has been no evidence advanced by
Meadows that it was, at all material times, and remains,
ready and willing to
arbitrate the subject disputes.  Moreover, the application lies uncomfortably
beside the position adopted by
Meadows before Rolfe J.  There, in reliance upon
the Kemp affidavit, it was submitted that matters touching the discretionary
basis
of the relief sought included the fact that all of the possible witnesses
and documents of Meadows were situated in Europe or the
United States.  Yet the
submission to arbitration upon which Meadows relies in this application
requires arbitration in Australia.
<P>

17	It was put to Rolfe J in the following terms (at pp 9-10):
<P>

	             "In relation to the discretionary grounds Mr Walton submitted
that New South Wales is 		a clearly inappropriate forum
because any contracts
of reinsurance were made and 		intended to beperformed outside Australia; all
communications involving the
			defendant in relation to the reinsurance
occurred in England; the administration of all 		claims on behalf of the
plaintiff was
conducted by Heath England in England; the 		plaintiff's files in
relation to professional liability claims are kept in England;
and all
documents, and presumably witnesses, necessary to substantiate a claim against
the 		reinsurer are in England.  In so far
as these matters related to the
position of the 			plaintiff they hardly assisted the defendant at a
discretionary level, the real
question 		being what problems would confront the
defendant.  The submission continued that in 		relation to the issues raised in
the Summons regarding "the alleged contract of 			reinsurance", the relevant
witnesses and the records relied on by the defendant
are in 		England, Guernsey
or the United States, but not Australia.  The evidence established, 		in my
opinion, that in so far as
the defendant had documents they were, in all
probability, in Tennessee.  No relevant witnesses were identified.
<P>

		In paragraph 42 of his affidavit of 25 September 1998, Mr Kemp said that at
no time had 		any terms of any reinsurance contract
been conveyed by the
plaintiff to the defendant.
<P>

		In paragraph 16 of his affidavit of 1 December 1998 he referred to the
administration of 		claims made upon the defendant, and
said:-
<P>

		<b>	"All witnesses and evidence as to the administration of reinsurance
claims, 			as well as to the agreements and correspondences between
Meadows and
		Heath England is located in England, Guernsey and/or the United
States."</b>
<P>

		In paragraph 18 he said that through the usual practice of administering
reinsurance 		claims, all documents necessary to substantiate
a claim against
the reinsurer, both on 		the merits and as to quantum, would be provided by the
plaintiff to Heath England to 		satisfy
the legitimate concerns of the
reinsurer.  He continued that all such 			documentation is in England or would
be required to be transferred
to England for 		administration of the claims
with the defendant and the other reinsurers."
<P>

		Those are not the submissions of a party ready to arbitrate and requiring
arbitration of disputes in Australia.  
<P>

18	I note in passing that inconsistently, in my view, with those submissions,
it was also advanced on behalf of Meadows before Rolfe
J that in the exercise
of discretion his Honour should have regard to the operation of article XVIII.
The matter was dealt with at
pages 16 to 31 of Rolfe J's judgment, the first
reference to which reads as follows:
<P>

		"Article XIX provided for arbitration by a Court of Arbitration consisting of
three 		members "which shall meet in Australia".
 Mr Walton submitted that if
this was the 		proper wording of the policy, which he did not concede, the
dispute should be referred
		to arbitration and, on that ground, the present
proceedings should be stayed.  There 		was no elaboration of this bald
submission."
<P>

Article XIX referred to by Rolfe J reflects a restructuring of agreement terms
in subsequent years to the relevant policy years.
<P>

19	The application by Heath under paragraph 2(b) of its notice of motion is
based, alternatively, upon Pt 18 r 3 of the Supreme
Court Rules and Pt 13 r 2.
Pt 18 r 3 is in the following terms:
<P>

		"3 (1)	Where admissions are made by a party, whether by his pleading or
otherwise, 		the Court may, on the application of any
other party, give any
judgment or make any 		order to which the applicant is entitled on the
admissions.
<P>

		(2)	The Court may exercise its powers under subrule (1) notwithstanding that
other questions in the proceedings have not been
determined."
<P>

20	It is clear that the admissions to which Pt 18 r 3 applies extend to
informal admissions:  while it is recognised that reliance
upon such admissions
will require the facts and terms of the admission to be established and may
require evidence of the circumstances
of the making of the alleged
admission.
<P>

21	In <b>Ellis v Allen </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1914%5d%201%20Ch%20904" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1914] 1 Ch 904</a> at 908-909, the object of a
comparable rule was described in the following terms:
<P>

		"The object of the rule was to enable a party to obtain speedy judgment where
the 		other party has made a plain admission entitling
the former to succeed.
I do not think r. 		6 should be confined as suggested.  In my judgment it
applies wherever there is a clear
		admission of facts in the face of which it
is impossible for the party making it to 			succeed."
<P>

22	A similar provision in the High Court Rules was considered in <b>In the
Matter of the Trade Marks Act 1955-1958 and in the Matter of Registered Trade
Marks "Certina" and "Certina DS"</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%2044%20ALJR%20191" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 44 ALJR 191</a> at 192-193.  There
Barwick CJ expressed the care with which such a power should be exercised in
the following terms:
<P>

		"The power which the rule gives to a Justice in chambers must be exercised
with great 		care.  This aspect of the rule was examined
in <i>General Steel
Industries Inc. v. 			Commissioner for Railways </i>... But in a clear case a
proper exercise of the power will 		obviate the delay involved in a hearing and
will save unnecessary expense."
<P>

         I have occasion to return to <b>General Steel </b>later in these
reasons.  
<P>

23	<b>Certina </b>and <b>Ellis </b>were followed by Needham J in <b>Kelly v
Mawson </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20NSWLR%20184" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 NSWLR 184</a> as decisions in which evidence of the facts
surrounding the admission relied upon were admitted in support of the
application for
judgment.  
<P>

24	The discretionary nature of the relief provided by Pt 18 r 3 was emphasised
in <b>Termijtelen v Van Arkel </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%201%20NSWLR%20525" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1974] 1 NSWLR 525</a>, a decision of the Court
of Appeal in which the following passage appears in the judgment of Hope JA (at
529):
<P>

	     	"Thus the power of the court to grant relief on motion for decree in any
of these three 		ways is discretionary, and the
court is not bound to grant it
because of admissions 		arising in the pleadings, or because of default in
pleading.  There seems
to be 		implicit in the practice of the court, as
illustrated in relation to these three forms of 		application, a right to
refuse
to act on admissions, whether arising as a result of s. 38 of 		the
<i>Equity Act </i>or otherwise."
<P>

25	That case was concerned with deemed admissions on the pleadings.  However, I
think the principle holds good in considering the
exercise of power under Pt 18
r 3.  
<P>

26	The reference in the order sought in paragraph 2(b) of Heath's notice of
motion to a claim relating to Priestley &amp; Morris
is a reference to a claim
for indemnity in the second policy year arising out of a damages claim against
Priestley &amp; Morris (the
Priestly &amp; Morris claim) brought by trustees of
certain trusts for the negligent performance by Priestley &amp; Morris of their
duties as auditors of the trusts.  
<P>

27	The claim was brought in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1991 and was
settled by agreement in writing bearing date 1 April 1997
(the settlement
agreement) to which the trustees, Priestley &amp; Morris, AMP General Insurance
Ltd (AMP), Heath, FAI General Insurance
Company Ltd (FAI) and GIO Insurance Ltd
(GIO) were parties.  The settlement agreement provided for payment by those
insurers to the
trustees on behalf of Priestley &amp; Morris the sum of
$33,000,000 in full and final settlement of the claim against Priestley &amp;
Morris.  The obligation of those insurers to make the payments was several in
the following shares:
<P>

		"(i)          AMP $2,000,000 all inclusive;
<P>

		(ii) 	FAI $18,000,000 all inclusive;
<P>

		(iii) 	(Heath) $10,000,000 all inclusive;
<P>

		(iv) 	GIO $3,000,000 all inclusive."
<P>

28	The settlement agreement also called for a possible further payment of
$2,000,000 by GIO in the circumstances there stipulated.
 Heath's obligations
were satisfied by payment of $10,000,000 to the plaintiffs on 21 March 1997.
That is not disputed.  Nor does
the defence assert that the claim fell outside
the indemnity relating to the second policy year.  The evidence disclosed that
notice
of circumstances that could give rise to the Priestley &amp; Morris
claim was given on 31 December 1990 and received on 4 January
1991.  Under the
terms of the professional indemnity policy for the second policy year, the
claim was deemed to be made upon the
giving of that notice.
<P>

29	It will be observed that the payments by the insurers under the settlement
agreement involved a payment that went beyond the
layer in respect of which
Meadows held a 7.5 per cent quota share of $5,000,000 in excess of $5,000,000
any one policy any one risk.
 The layers of insurance in conformity with the
several liability of those insurers under the settlement agreement was
evidenced
in the Kemp affidavit as being as follows:  AMP was the primary
insurer for $2,000,000:  FAI carried the layer of $18,000,000 in
excess of
$2,000,000 and Heath carried $10,000,000 in excess of $20,000,000.  It is not
clear from that evidence where GIO fits into
the insurance layers.  I have not
found it necessary to resolve that matter.
<P>

30	Prior to the settlement agreement, Meadows had been informed of the
Priestley &amp; Morris claim.  This is evidenced in the Kemp
affidavit which
showed that, sometime prior to 3 March 1993, extensive details of the claim,
and of the proceedings based upon the
claim, had been forwarded to Meadows'
office at the Island of Guernsey during 1992.  
<P>

31	Meadows relied upon the affidavit of Alice Palacio sworn 24 February 1999
(the Palacio affidavit), which, in many respects, complemented
the affidavit
evidence of Meadows' solicitor as contained in the Kemp affidavit.  Palacio was
a director of Meadows and admitted
that Meadows had undertaken reinsurance
risks written by Heath for each of the two policy years which she asserted
limited Meadows'
liability for the first policy year to five per cent of
$5,000,000 in excess of $5,000,000, namely $250,000, and for the second policy
year to 7.5 per cent, or $375,000.  She evidenced receipt of notification from
Heath in 1992 of the Priestley &amp; Morris claim
and then asserts there was a
gap in information received until being informed of the settlement agreement in
April 1997.  
<P>

32	While the Palacio affidavit sets out some detail of discussions said to have
taken place with CE Heath Insurance (Brokering)
Ltd concerning consideration of
the "commutation" of accounts as between Meadows and Heath, it is common ground
that the commutation
subject matter has no bearing upon the issues I am
required to determine.  She testified to the holding of a meeting with a
representative
of Heath on 1 May 1997.  Shortly prior to that meeting she said
she received voluminous material relating to the Priestley &amp;
Morris claim
which had not been provided to her previously.
<P>

33	Among the matters for discussion at the meeting was the basis of a Heath
broadsheet which presented a balance debit said to be
owed by Meadows to Heath
in the sum of $1,026,263.  It was her evidence that at the meeting she
complained about the absence of adequate
information and of the manner in which
the alleged liabilities of Meadows to Heath had increased in the statements
provided by Heath
from time to time.
<P>

34	There was nothing in that meeting, in my view, as evidenced by Palacio, that
could be regarded as an admission.  Communications
which had passed between
Meadows and Heath in the months that followed the 1 May 1997 meeting were
evidenced by the Palacio affidavit
and, for her part, she treated those
communications as evidencing her challenge to the correctness of the Heath
accounts and thus
evidencing a failure on the part of Heath to provide
information as requested to enable Meadows to further consider the claims. 

<P>

35	She raised in her affidavit a number of hypothetical considerations that
could give rise to a defence to Heath's claim.  However,
these are little
better than conjecture without any factual basis and have neither been pleaded
by way of defence, nor notified as
being the subject matter of any proposed
application to amend the defence or of a proposed cross-claim in these
proceedings.  
<P>

36	A good illustration, I think, of the nature of that aspect of the Palacio
affidavit is found in paragraph 46.  Having recounted
the several months in
1997 when she claimed that she had unsuccessfully sought information from
Heath, she testified as follows:
<P>

		"One of the reasons why the information requested by Meadows is critical and
why I 		would never have admitted that Meadows was
liable to the plaintiff in
any amount, is 		because the risks alleged to be re-insured were based on
claims-made policies.  If the
		claims upon which the plaintiff seeks
indemnification were first made in years other 		than 1989 and 1990, Meadows is
simply not
liable.  Moreover, when these claims were 		made will directly
effect the amount of indemnification, if any, for which Meadows may
		be
liable. Further, if these claims arose prior to Meadows execution of the slips,
and 		Meadows was not advised of the pendency
of these matters (which it was
not), 			Meadows was fraudulently induced to enter into these re-insurance
treaties."
<P>

37	It is a little difficult to reconcile that much of the Palacio complaint of
lack of information of the Priestley &amp; Morris
claim after 1992, 1993 until
April 1997 with the evidence of Meadows' own solicitor in the Kemp affidavit.
That evidenced the provision
by Heath to Meadows in 1995 of "the latest
documentation" relating to the Priestley &amp; Morris claim.  That information
included
a lengthy letter from Ebsworth &amp; Ebsworth to their client, the
primary insurer, detailing aspects of the litigation relating
to the Priestley
&amp; Morris claim.  Although Meadows was invited to confirm receipt of that
material, and impliedly invited to
confirm that the documentation was "in
order", there is no evidence in the Kemp affidavit or elsewhere that Meadows
responded to
any of the communications received by it in 1992, 1993 or 1995.
The complaints of lack of information or any assertion of a right
to
participate in the litigation in accordance with article VIII of the agreement
only came to light when a request for payment was
made by Heath after
settlement of the Priestley &amp; Morris claim.
<P>

38	The principal material relied upon by Heath as an admission of liability as
to $375,000, a portion of the Priestley &amp; Morris
claim, is evidenced in the
Kemp affidavit.  Following the 1 May meeting, Heath wrote to Meadows confirming
"action points" agreed
at the meeting and which included the following:
<P>

		"1.	Meadows agree the unpaid balances due to (Heath) total $535,625.
<P>

		2.	(Heath) require payment of the above monies within 10 days."
<P>

39	Meadows responded in the following terms which was also noted in Rolfe J's
judgment:
<P>

		"Meadows is in receipt of your fax dated May 2nd.  Meadows agreed that the
claims 		presented appeared to be in order and that
the total amounts owing to
(Heath) are Aud 		$535,625.  Meadows is still reviewing the Priestley &amp;
Morris claim and may have
further 		questions.  As per the claims presented,
Meadows' exposure on the 1990 underwriting 		year has been maximised at Aud
$375,000
and there are no further liabilities that can be 		presented."
<P>

40	That letter concluded with the following:
<P>

		"We are very interested in commuting this account with Winterthur but Meadows
did 		not agree to any of the commutation terms
noted in your fax.  As
discussed, Meadows 		is in run-off and has not written any new business since
late which has forced us to
be 		prudent with cash flow since the majority of
premiums were collected by 1990 along 		with payment of the majority of its
claims.
 Most of Meadows' available cash at this 		time is pledged to secure
letters of credit with other cedents.  I advised in our meeting
		that a review
would be made of Meadows' current position to identify our availability 		of
cash for this account along with Meadows'
other liabilities and this has been
completed.  We are willing to make an offer of $100,000 in full and final
settlement of all 
	claims for both the 1989 and 1990 underwriting years.  We
ask that you take this offer 		into serious consideration at this time.
 I
await your reply."
<P>

41	There are a number of aspects recorded in that evidence upon which Heath
relies as going to matters affecting my discretion on
this application and to
which reference is later made in these reasons.  
<P>

42	The sum of $535,625 had been identified in the facsimile of Heath to Meadows
of 30 April 1997 as being made up of $375,000 on
the Priestley &amp; Morris
claim and $160,625 in relation to the further claim which was the subject of
the order sought in paragraph
2(a) in Heath's notice of motion which is no
longer pressed. 
<P>

43	A summary of balances was submitted by Heath to Meadows on 15 May 1997 and
Meadows responded to that in the following terms in
relation to the second
policy year:
<P>

		"On the 1990 underwriting year, Meadows only participated for 7.5% on $5m xs
$5m 		which again Meadows total exposure is $375,000
not $426,263 per your
accounts."
<P>

44	It is said that by that evidence Meadows has admitted liability in respect
of the Priestley &amp; Morris claim in the sum of
$375,000.  For my part, I
would not be prepared to treat that material as a clear and unambiguous
admission of liability sufficient
to found a judgment under Pt 18 r 3.  I do
think the material goes close to such an admission and, consistently with that
view, I
think it is relevant evidence in considering whether Heath is entitled
to the order sought pursuant to Pt 13 r 2.  I think the probabilities
are that
Palacio accepted the correctness of the calculation of that part of Heath's
entitlement in relation to the Priestley &amp;
Morris claim, while reserving
Meadows' position.  The claimed impecuniosity in the circumstances of run down
of Meadows' business
outlined in its letter of 14 May 1997 may have had some
bearing on that approach.
<P>

45	I have been left in little doubt that Palacio recognised that Meadows was
liable for that amount at least in relation to the
Priestley &amp; Morris
claim, but was not prepared to make an unequivocal admission to that effect.

<P>

46	The Pt 13 r 2 application is of a kind which is seen comparatively
frequently in matters listed in the commercial list.  Part
13 r 2(1) provides
as follows:
<P>

	   "2  (1)   Where, on application by the plaintiff in relation to any claim
for relief or any 		part of any claim for relief of
the plaintiff -
<P>

		(a) 	there is evidence of the facts on which the claim or part is based; and
(b) 	there is evidence given by the plaintiff or
by some responsible person
that, in		 the belief of the person giving the evidence, the defendant has no
defence to the claim 		or
part, or no defence except as to the amount of any
damages claimed, the Court may, 		by order, on terms, give such judgment for
the
plaintiff on that claim or part as the 		nature of the case requires."
<P>

47	The principles upon which the power under this rule should be exercised have
been stated clearly and often, referring particularly
to the principles as
stated in <b>General Steel Industries Incorporated v Commissioner for Railways
(NSW) </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 112 CLR 125</a> at 129 in the judgment of Barwick CJ,  <b>Dey v
Victorian Railways Commissioners </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1949/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1949] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281949%29%2078%20CLR%2062" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1949) 78 CLR 62</a> at 91 and <b>Webster v
Lampard </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20598" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 598.</a>  I think it is sufficient to extract the
following passage from the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ in
<b>Webster</b> at 602:
<P>

		"It is important to note at the outset that the issue before the learned
Master on the 		application for summary judgment was
not whether Mr. and Mrs.
Webster would 		probably succeed in their action against Sergeant Lampard.  It
was whether the material
		before the Master demonstrated that that action
should not be permitted to go to trial 		in the ordinary way because it was
apparent
that it must fail.  The power to order 			summary judgment must be
exercised with "exceptional caution" and "should never be 		exercised
unless it
is clear that there is no real question to be tried".  As Dixon J. 			commented
in <i>Dey v. Victorian Railways Commissioners</i>:
<P>

			"A case must be very clear indeed to justify the summary intervention 				of
the court to prevent a plaintiff submitting his
case for determination in the
appointed manner by the court with or without a jury.  The fact that a
transaction is intricate may
not disentitle the court to examine a cause of
action alleged to grow out of it for the purpose of seeing whether the
proceeding
amounts to an abuse of process or is vexatious.  But once it
appears that there is a real question to be determined whether of fact
or law
and that the rights of the parties depend upon it, then it is not competent for
		the court to dismiss the action as frivolous
and vexatious and an abuse of
process."
<P>

		Nowhere is that need for exceptional caution more important than in a case
where the 		ultimate outcome turns upon the resolution
of some disputed issue
or issues of fact.  In 		such a case, it is essential that "great care ... be
exercised to ensure that under
the 		guise of achieving expeditious finality a
plaintiff is not improperly deprived of his 		opportunity for the trial of his
case
by appointed tribunal"."
<P>

48	The factual material I have examined so far in these reasons concerned
primarily the `admission' issue.  In considering the operation
of Pt 13 r 2,
the exercise is principally concerned with the defence raised by Meadows to
this aspect of Heath's claim.  The conclusion
I have reached is that Meadows
has no defence.
<P>

49	The claim of equitable set-off for damages for breach of article VIII, in my
view, is an empty assertion.  At the very best,
it would sound in nominal
damages.  As earlier noted, the defence, not surprisingly, makes no attempt to
quantify damages.  I have
no doubt that that is for the reason that there are
no damages, other than nominal, to quantify.  Senior Counsel for Meadows
conceded,
properly, I think, that he was unable to identify any damages other
than nominal which could be claimed by way of equitable set-off
against this
part of the Priestley &amp; Morris claim.  
<P>

50	All of those observations assume that there is an arguable case for breach
of article VIII available to Meadows.  I very much
doubt that it has such a
case.  On its own evidence, Meadows received communications through 1992, 1993
and 1995 from Heath forwarding
substantial material outlining aspects of the
claim, of the proceedings relating to the claim and steps being taken in
relation to
the proceedings.  At no stage, the evidence disclosed, and it is
not disputed, did Meadows make any request to take part, in any
way, in the
control or conduct of the claim, of the proceedings relating to it or in its
settlement.
<P>

51	Article VIII predicates a request by Meadows so to participate and in the
face of the information provided to it, and in the
absence of any such request,
I fail to see any possible basis upon which a breach of article VIII could be
successfully raised. 
However, I prefer to deal with the question on the basis
that there is some arguable case of breach, but one that could not amount
to
anything more than nominal damages.  
<P>

52	I think it is important to record that it is only that claim for breach of
article VIII that forms the basis for set-off that
is asserted by Meadows in
its defence.  In particular, there is no claim for set-off in relation to items
of credit that are noted
in the general statements of accounts submitted by
Heath to Meadows in relation to outstanding balances.
<P>

53	There is one further matter which I think is a legitimate one touching the
exercise of the discretion under Pt 13 r 2.  As noted
in the form of order
sought, it is a limited judgment which the Court is asked to give.  In some
circumstances there may be reasons
why the Court would decline to give limited
judgment, although no such considerations have been advanced on behalf of
Meadows.
<P>

54	Nevertheless, I think the material disclosed by Meadows in its letter of 14
May 1997 to Heath of a claimed run down of its business
and of the commitment
of available funds to obligations other than those owed to Heath, indicates
some utility in giving judgment
in a limited form.  This has the advantage of a
comparatively inexpensive procedure for judgment against Meadows whose
resources
may turn out to be limited and insufficient to meet any judgment for
a greater sum arrived at after more extensive and costly proceedings.
 
<P>

55	Accordingly, I give judgment in terms of order 2(b) in the orders sought in
the plaintiff's notice of motion.  I dismiss the
defendant's motion and order
the defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs of both motions.
<P>

56	Judgment is to include interest.  That has been calculated by Heath at court
schedule rates from 21 March 1997, that being the
date of its payment in
satisfaction of its obligation under the settlement agreement.  Having regard
to the fact that no notification
of the settlement agreement appears to have
been given to Meadows prior to Heath's letter to Meadows of 18 April 1997, I
think interest
should begin to run on and from 19 May 1997.  
<P>

57	Accordingly, I give judgment in terms of paragraph 2(b) of the plaintiff's
notice of motion for $375,000 plus interest of $63,832
calculated at 10.5% from
19 May 1997; at 10% from 1 September 1997 and at 9.5% from 31 September 1998 to
8 March 1999.  I direct
the matter be placed in the list for further directions
on 12 March 1999.
<P>
