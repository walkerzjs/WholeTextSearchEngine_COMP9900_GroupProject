<P>

<center><b><u>Reasons for Judgment</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

1	By notice of motion filed on 9 September 1998 the defendant seeks leave to
file a cross-claim naming Amalgamated Television Services
Pty Limited
("Amalgamated Television") as cross-defendant in defamation proceedings fixed
to commence on 1 February 1999 for a jury
hearing estimated to occupy two
weeks.
<P>

2	Except insofar as the contrary appears I shall, for the purposes of this
interlocutory judgment only, assume the truth of various
facts alleged by the
parties to the proceedings.   That assumption should not be taken to represent
concluded findings of any fact
or facts that may be in issue in the principal
proceedings.   The facts as stated are drawn from affidavit and oral evidence
adduced
in support of the notice of motion, and from previous interlocutory
judgments to which I was referred.
<P>

3	On 21 June 1994 the plaintiff filed a statement of claim in this Court
claiming damages from the defendant for defamatory statements
he alleged were
published by her in an interview televised on the Channel 7 network, which is
owned and operated by Amalgamated Television.
  In the interview the defendant
asserted that the plaintiff, a neighbour, had deposited bags of sewage in her
letterbox and had
then thrown them in her face in the presence of her young
daughter.   The allegations appear to have arisen out of a dispute that
followed building work at the defendant's house, which caused disruption to the
sewerage pipes in her property.
<P>

4	On 1 August 1994 the defendant filed a defence and cross claim, naming the
plaintiff as cross-defendant, pleading various causes
of action.   In
paragraphs 1 and 2 she alleged that the plaintiff had assaulted her by throwing
a bag of sewage upon her, as a result
of which she suffered severe personal
injury, loss and damage;   in paragraphs 3 and 4 she alleged that the plaintiff
had assaulted
her two year old daughter by throwing over her face and body a
plastic bag of dirt, sewage and excrement, as a result of which she,
(the
defendant cross-claimant) suffered nervous shock.   In paragraphs 5 to 8 she
alleged that the plaintiff had, in 1988, 1989,
1991, 1992 and 1993, in various
ways trespassed upon her property causing her humiliation, mental anguish,
stress and other loss
and damage;   in paragraph 9 she alleged that the
plaintiff had, in August 1992, defamed her by describing her as "a snotty nosed
bitch".   She sought damages, aggravated and punitive damages, and interest.
<P>

5	On the same day the plaintiff filed a Reply, and, subsequently, on 6
September 1994, a defence to the cross-claim.   He denied
the defendant's
allegations and challenged her entitlement to make the claim contained in
paragraphs 3 and 4 of the cross-claim (the
alleged assault upon her daughter).

<P>

6	By notice of motion filed on 19 February 1996 the defendant applied for leave
to amend the cross-claim by adding her daughter
as a second cross-claimant, and
by adding Amalgamated Television as a second cross-defendant.   A draft of the
proposed amended cross-claim
was annexed to the notice of motion.
<P>

7	The notice of motion was determined by Finnane AJ on 22 August 1997.   He
made various orders:  he struck out paragraphs 1, 2
and 3 of the cross-claim
(these were the claims that the plaintiff assaulted the defendant, and her
claim for nervous shock resulting
from the alleged assault upon her daughter).
He also refused leave to the defendant to join the proceedings brought by her
daughter
in the principal proceedings.   He did, however, grant leave to the
defendant to amend her cross-claim to commence proceedings against
Amalgamated
Television provided she did so within twenty-eight days of the date of judgment
(22 August 1997).
<P>

8	In order to explain the decision of Finnane AJ it is necessary to recount a
little more of the history.  The facts here stated
are drawn from the judgment
of Finnane AJ of 22 August 1997.  The alleged events the subject of the
defendant's assertions on the
television interview took place on 22 April 1993.
 Following this, on 27 April, the defendant sought in the Local Court an order
under s 562 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a></i> restraining the plaintiff from
assaulting, attempting to assault, intimidate, harass, threaten, molest or
otherwise interfere with
her, and an order restraining his entry or attempted
entry to her property, or attempting to contact the defendant or her family
except in writing.   The plaintiff sought similar orders against the defendant.
 The hearing the two claims commenced on 8 March
1994.  Both the plaintiff and
the defendant gave evidence about the events in question.
<P>

9	As summarised by Finnane AJ, the magistrate made findings substantially
disbelieving the defendant's allegations and reflecting
adversely upon her
credibility.   Finnane AJ therefore concluded that the findings of the
magistrate constituted an issue estoppel
in relation to the claims made by the
defendant in paragraphs 1,2 and 3 of the cross-claim.   
<P>

10	His Honour then refused leave to the defendant to amend her existing
cross-claim in terms of the draft amended cross-claim annexed
to the notice of
motion.   [In doing so, he appears mistakenly to have believed that the
defendant's application for leave to amend
included an application to add the
cross-claim by adding the claim that the plaintiff had defamed her.   As these
paragraphs appeared
in the cross-claim as originally filed (paragraph 9), such
leave was not necessary.   This, at present, appears to be neither here
nor
there.]
<P>

11	An application by the defendant for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal
was dismissed on 10 November 1997.   
<P>

12	The defendant did not avail herself of the leave granted to her to add
Amalgamated Television as a cross-defendant within the
time specified.   
<P>

13	By a further notice of motion filed 16 December 1997 the defendant sought
leave to file a differently amended cross-claim.  
This proposed amended
cross-claim contained allegations of assault in terms that varied only slightly
from those previously pleaded,
and of nervous shock as a result of the alleged
assault on the defendant's daughter.   Further, the proposed amended
cross-claim
contained a claim against Amalgamated Television claiming indemnity
or contribution pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(1)(c)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act, 1946</a>.</i>
<P>

14	On 18 March 1998 Levine J refused leave so to amend the cross-claim.   His
Honour observed that the only reason given by the
defendant for failing to
avail herself of the leave granted by Finnane AJ was that it was considered
convenient to keep the proposed
cross-claim against Amalgamated Television in
the same document as the cross-claim she proposed to bring against the
plaintiff. 
 He considered this a quite unsatisfactory explanation for failing
to take advantage of the opportunity offered by Finnane AJ, and,
because of
what he considered to be the insufficiency of the reason advanced, declined the
leave sought.   
<P>

15	He added:
<P>

	"It will be a matter for the defendant whether or not she chooses to seek to
make a fresh application to initiate a cross-claim
against Channel 7, but it
would have to be supported, at the very least, by some evidence as to the
grounds for seeking so to do
and in the event that the defendant chooses to
take this course I would anticipate the desirability of notice being given to
Channel
7 of any further application to be made.   I would, speaking for
myself, be reluctant to entertain any further application in the
light of the
plaintiff's opposition without notice being given to Channel 7.   In the event
of a notice of motion seeking leave to
cross-claim against Amalgamated
Television Services Pty Limited being filed, I would anticipate a direction
given that a copy of
all relevant process be provided to that organisation to
give it an opportunity to be heard in opposition, given particularly  the
lapse
of four years since the publication of the relevant matter complained of."
(<b>Green  v  Schneller</b>, unreported, Levine J, 18 March 1998)
<P>

16	Those remarks were made on 18 March 1998.  I was informed that the principal
proceedings were set down for trial commencing 1
February 1999, with a two week
estimate.   This occurred at a call-up on 23 October 1998.  
<P>

17	The defendant's current notice of motion was filed on 9 September 1998,
prior to the date on which the proceedings were fixed
for hearing.   It was
unable to be heard, for various reasons, including my commitments in the
Criminal Division and the Court of
Criminal Appeal.   The view had apparently
been taken by the defamation judge that it was desirable that this application
be heard
by the trial judge if possible.   I would therefore not regard as a
factor antipathetical to the defendant's claim any delay beyond
9 September
1998.   However, there is still an extraordinary set of circumstances which the
defendant must explain before I would
consider it appropriate to grant leave at
this late state of the proceedings to join an additional cross-defendant.   In
saying that
I recognise the apparent strength of the defendant's claim against
Amalgamated Television.   For the purposes of this decision, I
assume that,
while the defendant participated in the televised interview in the knowledge
and with the intention that it would be
transmitted to a multifarious audience,
nevertheless it was Amalgamated Television that provided the means for
publication of the
defendant's comments.   The defendant therefore appears to
have an arguable case for contribution by Amalgamated Television.   In
an
affidavit filed in support of the notice of motion the defendant's solicitor,
Mr Dennis, deposed that:
<P>

	"It was only after the refusal of leave to appeal that the availability of a
cross-claim against Channel 7 became acutely important."
<P>

18	I do not regard this explanation for the failure to take advantage of the
leave granted by Finnane AJ. as any more satisfactory
than that offered to
Levine J in March 1998. In any event leave to appeal was refused in November
1997, and Levine J. refused the
subsequent application on 18 March 1998.
<P>

19	The argument put on behalf of the defendant in support of the grant of leave
was, effectively, that she remains entitled, under
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lrpa1946404/" class="autolink_findacts">Law Reform
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946</a></i>, to seek indemnity or contribution from
Amalgamated Television, and that no statute of limitations will, for some years
to come,
defeat that right.   Accordingly, it would be more convenient for the
claim against Amalgamated Television to be litigated in the
same proceedings as
the issues between herself and the plaintiff, rather than in separate
proceedings.   Her counsel acknowledged
that it was unlikely that Amalgamated
Television would be in a position to participate in a hearing commencing in
February 1999,
but urged that leave be granted and the hearing of the
cross-claim be separated from the hearing of the principal proceedings.
<P>

20	I do not regard this, either, as a satisfactory approach to the difficult
situation that has been created.   Given the time of
year (the hearing of the
notice of motion could not take place until 22 December 1998) it would scarcely
be fair to Amalgamated Television
to expect that organisation to be ready for a
contested hearing at such short notice and this was not in question.   There
was evidence
in affidavit form from Ms Rebecca Barnett, solicitor acting for
Amalgamated Television, outlining the difficulties she had experienced
in
obtaining information concerning the telecast.  In response to this counsel for
the defendant tendered a bundle of correspondence
between the defendant and
Amalgamated Television or its various employees commencing 5 July 1994, in
which the defendant drew attention
to involvement of Amalgamated Television and
its potential liability.   That correspondence, however, came to an end on 10
November
1994, and there was no evidence of any further correspondence or
communication until after the decision of Levine J.
<P>

21	The plaintiff was represented by counsel on the application but took little
real part, regarding himself as relatively uninvolved
in the issue between the
defendant and Amalgamated Television.   This was undoubtedly because of the
defendant's concession that
the cross-claim, even if leave were granted, would
not be heard at the same time as the principal claim.   However, it seems to me
that the plaintiff's interests are, at least potentially, involved in the
present application.   It is only necessary to consider
for a moment the steps
likely to occur following the decision on this notice of motion.   If I were to
grant leave to the defendant
to join Amalgamated Television in the proceedings
as a cross-defendant, virtually inevitably the next step will be an application
for adjournment by Amalgamated Television in order to prepare itself for a
hearing, and for all matters to be litigated in a single
hearing.   There is
much to be said for the resolution of all these matters in that way;   but not,
in the present circumstances,
at the almost certain expense of the plaintiff's
hearing date.
<P>

22	During the course of the hearing of the notice of motion I raised the
question of whether it was correct for counsel for the
defendant to assert, as
he did, that the defendant would retain her right to bring proceedings for
indemnity and/or contribution
against Amalgamated Television, even after the
conclusion of the principal proceedings.   The cause for my concern was the
decision
of the High Court in <b>Port of Melbourne Authority  v  Anshun Pty
Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20147%20CLR%20589" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 147 CLR 589.</a>   Having re-read those judgments, and having
read the written submissions from both counsel that resulted from that
concern, I am
satisfied that that decision will not prevent the prosecution by
the defendant of any claim she may wish to bring against Amalgamated
Television.
<P>

23	I have concluded that the defendant has had more than ample opportunities
extended to her to bring the proceedings she now wishes
to bring against
Amalgamated Television;   it is simply too late in the day to permit a
cross-claim to be brought in the present
proceedings.
<P>

24	The notice of motion is dismissed.   I order the defendant to pay the costs
of Amalgamated Television Services Pty Limited.
