<b>JUDGMENT  (T1428: Directions)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  Directions are required in relation to submissions and argument
for the resolution of the two substantive applications
presently outstanding,
namely, the application in relation to the amendment of the defence case on the
issue of justification and
the plaintiff's application to have set aside the
subpoena to the Police Service, issued by the defendant.  I do not propose to
isolate
the question or issue in respect of which evidence was heard from Dr
Dent and Dr White, a quite substantial period of time ago.
<P>

2	I will be assisted by written submissions from both sides in chief, in
response and in reply, which submissions are required to
set out transcript
references, exhibit references, and affidavit reference by references to date
and particular paragraphs.
<P>

3	I have heard from senior counsel for each side this morning as to varyious
suggestions as to a timetable, that for the plaintiff
suggesting that attention
next week, that is the week  commencing 10th May, be devoted  to the provision
of written submissions and
in the following week any required number of days be
devoted to oral submissions.  The suggestion from senior counsel for the
defendant
is that, in effect, both written and oral submissions can be
accommodated next week.  Not ignoring the important consideration of
fairness
to myself, I think the appropriate course is the following.
<P>

4	By noon on Tuesday 11th May 1999 the plaintiff is to have delivered his
written submissions in support of the application to set-aside
the subpoena.
By noon on Wednesday 12th May 1999 the defendant is to have delivered written
submissions (a) in support of the amendment
application, (b) in opposition to
the application to set-aside the subpoena.
<P>

5	By noon on Thursday 13th May 1999 the plaintiff is to have delivered
submissions in response to the defendant's submissions in
support of the
amendment application, and in reply to the defendant's submissions to the
plaintiff's application to set-aside the
subpoena.  
<P>

6	By noon on Friday 14th May 1999 the defendant is to have delivered
submissions in reply to the plaintiff's submissions in response
to the
defendant's submission in support of the  application to amend. 
<P>

7	Oral submissions will be then heard on Monday 17th May.  
<P>

8	I will grant liberty to apply, which may be exercised during the course of
next week, in respect of any application to vary that
timetable for things that
might happen next.
<P>

9	I will stand the matter over for further directions to Monday 10th May at
10am for the purpose of the conclusion of the testimony
of Mr Potter.
<P>

10	MATTER ADJOURNED TO MONDAY 10 MAY 1999
