<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Imputations - capacity - form)</b>
<P>

1   	By his Statement of Claim filed on 28 May 1999 the
plaintiff alleges that the defendant, in 1997, published of and concerning
him
a certain book entitled "<i>Ian Roberts Finding Out</i>".  The relevant pages
of the book for the purposes of the action are appended to the Statement of
Claim.
<P>

2   	The imputations pleaded in paragraph 3 as arising from the
natural and ordinary meaning are as follows:
<P>

<i>"(a)	The plaintiff was incompetent as a business manager.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	The plaintiff failed in his duty as a business manager to Ian Roberts by
telling him to co-operate in the writing of a tacky story
about him in a low
grade, down market magazine.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	The plaintiff attempted to blackmail Ray and Jean Roberts.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	the plaintiff threatened Ray Roberts.</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	The plaintiff did not act in the best interests of his client because he
encouraged him to do some promotions for a clothing label
posing naked for a
contemptible amount of money".</i>
<P>

3   	The plaintiff seeks to add the following imputation:
<P>

<i>"(f)	The plaintiff is dishonest because without the permission of Mr Roberts
and against his wishes the plaintiff approved of the
article in the `New
Weekly' while Mr Roberts was overseas".</i>
<P>

4   	Imputations (c), (d), (e) and (f) are under challenge.
<P>

5   	It is said for the defendant that imputation (c) highlights
the class of cases of imputations where it is simply not sufficient
to
"<i>parrot</i>" something which appears in the matter complained of.  The words
in the matter complained of may be used in a figurative sense and
the
imputation has to be characterised with precision.
<P>

6   	A similar argument is advanced in relation to imputation
(d).
<P>

7   	I reject the submissions for the defendant in relation to
both.  This is a case where the words of the matter complained of
are perfectly
clear and the words in the imputation are perfectly clear.  The coincidence
between the latter and the former gives
rise, in my respectful view, to no
issue encapsulated by the expression used by counsel for the defendant "<i>what
is the jury to make of that?"</i>  There can be no rational or sensible basis
for suggesting that a jury would not understand what either of those
imputations means
as a compilation of ordinary English words.  There will be no
difficulty in the jury determining whether or not as a matter of fact
the
relevant part of the book carries such meanings.
<P>

8   	Imputations (c) and (d) are proper in form, are capable of
arising, are capable of being defamatory and will go to the jury.
<P>

9   	With respect to imputation (e) it is contended for the
defendant that the component of it that the plaintiff did not act in
the best
interests of his client is not necessarily capable of being defamatory in the
light of the balance of the imputation.  It
is further argued that there is
nothing there to support the notion of "<i>contemptible amount of money"</i>.
As to the last I would have considered the statement "<i>some friends who
thought the money was lousy</i>" sufficient by themselves and in context to
sustain that component of the imputation.  
<P>

10   	A pertinent part of the matter complained of is as
follows:
<P>

<i>"Nick had approached Ian a few months earlier and offered to represent him.
He had encouraged Ian to do some promotions for a clothing
label (naked)
against the advice of some friends who thought the money was lousy.  Ian seemed
more concerned with whether the client
was a nice bloke than with protecting
himself as an advertising asset.  Then New Weekly appeared offering not
unattractive quick
money - $20,000, less Nick's commission.  Never mind that it
was supermarket journalism, definitely downmarket, lower than Lowe's
and taking
Ian beyond the reach of a quality advertising market".</i>
<P>

11   	I am of the view that there is sufficient within that part
of the matter complained of set out above, at least, to sustain
on a capacity
argument imputation (e).  I do not consider it to be improper in form and I
consider it is capable of being defamatory.
<P>

12   	Imputation (e) will go to the jury.
<P>

13   	As to imputation (f), the short point for the defendant is
that the imputation is incapable of arising.  The imputation in
form asserts
the "<i>condition</i>" of the plaintiff namely, dishonesty, and the basis
therefor namely, that without Mr Roberts' approval and against Mr Roberts'
wishes
the plaintiff approved the article whilst Mr Roberts was abroad.
<P>

14   	A relevant part of the matter complained of is as
follows:
<P>

<i>"Ian was told that if he didn't cooperate with the magazine they were
running with a story anyway.  Better to take the money and at
least have a say
in the story.  He understood he had final approval on the story.  However, it
appeared the contract enabled Nick
to approve it, and the article hit the
stands after Ian had left for a holiday in England".</i>
<P>

15   	It was argued for the plaintiff that implicit from the
statement to the effect that Mr Roberts understood he had final approval
of the
story was the proposition that he had been told the consequences of his
non-cooperation and that his understanding as to approval
could only have come
from the plaintiff.
<P>

16   	After considering this imputation in particular and the
fact that it was attacked on the basis of capacity, I have come to
the view
that it is really a jury question.  I find that the material quoted from the
relevant section of the book is capable as
a matter of law of giving rise to
this imputation , and the imputation is capable of being defamatory. 
<P>

17   	Imputation (f) will go to the jury.
<P>

18   	It thus comes about that all imputations pleaded by the
plaintiff and to be relied upon (including (f)) are capable of arising,
capable
of being defamatory, are proper in form and will go to the jury.  
<P>

19   	I see no need for the plaintiff to incur the additional
costs of filing a further Amended Statement of Claim to plead imputation
(f) at
this stage.  The defendant knows that it is there and that it will be subject
to the consideration of the jury.  
<P>

20   	This is an appropriate case for an immediate referral of
the matter to that tribunal under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A(3)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a></i> (as
amended).  It is also appropriate that the defendant indicate without delay
whether or not there is to be an issue on publication
as is alleged in
paragraph 2 of the Statement of Claim.  If there is to be an issue (and I would
find that surprising unless there
are reasonable grounds therefor) it will be
speedily disposed of before the hearing.
<P>

21   	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	Imputation (a) - (f) inclusive will go to the jury.
<P>

2.	I order the separate determination of the question of fact as to whether the
matter complained of carries the imputations (a)
- (f) inclusive by the jury in
accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A(3)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a> </i>(as amended).
<P>

3.	I place the matter in the Holding List.
<P>

4.	The defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs of the application heard on 27
August 1999.
<P>

5.	Liberty to restore to the Defamation List on 5 days notice.
<P>
