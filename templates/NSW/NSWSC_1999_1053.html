<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Imputations - capacity - form - difference in substance - absolute
privilege - quasi-judicial tribunal - Thoroughbred Racing
Board)</b>
<P>

1   	The plaintiff sues the defendants for a multiplicity of
causes of action;  defamation, abuse of process and conspiracy to the
defame
and to abuse the process of the Thoroughbred Racing Board ("<i>TRB"</i>).
<P>

2   	As starting point is Annexure A to the Statement of Claim
(reproduced as Annexure A to these reasons).  It is contended that
on 9
September the first defendant (Waterhouse) published that material as follows
(paragraph 6):
<P>

<i>"(a)	Members, officers and staff of the NSW Thoroughbred Racing Board ("the
Board").</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	Mr R Stitt QC (Counsel retained by the Board).</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	Mr A Hartnell (a solicitor retained by the Board).</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	Mr T King (Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Jockey
Club).</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	Mr Arthur Harris and his solicitors (Verekers) and other persons the
identity of whom are as yet unknown to the Plaintiff".</i>
<P>

3   	It is next contended that at sometime not within the
knowledge of the plaintiff Waterhouse published the material in Annexure
B
(which is annexed hereto).  It is alleged that the material was part of an
affidavit made by Waterhouse but "<i>not filed or read in Court"</i>.  It is
said that Waterhouse published and gave a copy of that affidavit to the second
defendant (Harris) and to "<i>his solicitors"</i>.  Thus in relation to
Annexure B the first publication relied upon is by Waterhouse to Harris.
<P>

4   	It is next alleged that on 12 September 1997 Waterhouse
published Annexure B (or re-published it) to "<i>members, officers and staff of
the Board".</i>  That averment in paragraph 5 of the Statement of Claim is
amplified by the Particulars of Publication as follows:
<P>

<i>"</i><cite>Particulars of Publication</cite>
<P>

<i>The affidavit containing the material complained of was published by the
first Defendant to the second Defendant and his solicitors
with the knowledge
that the said affidavit was likely to be re-published by the second Defendant
to members, officers and staff of
the Board and to other persons and the second
Defendant duly published same to the Board, its officers and staff.  The first
Defendant
authorised and approved the second defendant so publishing the said
parts of the affidavit".</i>
<P>

5   	It is not until paragraph 7 of the Statement of Claim that
the allegation of defamation is made against the second defendant
Mr Harris.
It is alleged that on 12 September 1997 he published Annexure B as follows:
<P>

<i>"</i><cite>Particulars of Publication</cite>
<P>

<i>The second Defendant published the material complained of as set out in
annexure `B' being part of a 70 page written submission to
members of the
Board, its officers and staff.</i>
<P>

<i>The second Defendant also published the material to other persons the
identity of whom are not yet known to the Plaintiff".</i>
<P>

6   	In paragraph 9 the plaintiff alleges that Waterhouse abused
the process and procedures of the TRB as follows:
<P>

<i>"</i><cite>Particulars</cite>
<P>

<i>(a)	In about January 1996 the plaintiff had made a statutory declaration in
respect of proceedings involving Robert Waterhouse and
the Australian Jockey
Club.  This statutory declaration was critical of the first Defendant.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	The first Defendant published to the Board a statutory declaration dated
9 September 1997.  This declaration contained the material
set out in annexure
`A'.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	The supposed purpose of that part of the statutory declaration being
annexure `A' was for the providing of information to the
Board about the
application by Robert Waterhouse to have his warning off set aside.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	The predominant and real purpose of the first Defendant in including
annexure `A' in his statutory declaration was to discredit
the plaintiff so
that if the plaintiff's statutory declaration was read to members of the Board
it would not be accepted".</i>
<P>

7   	On 12 September 1997 the plaintiff alleges Harris abused
the process and procedures of the TRB as follows:
<P>

<i>"</i><cite>Particulars</cite>
<P>

<i>(a)	On 12 September 1997 the second Defendant published written submissions
to the Board opposing the Application of Robert Waterhouse
to have his
warning-off set aside.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	The second Defendant included the material set out in annexure `B' in
the said written submissions.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	The second Defendant's publication of the material set out in annexure
`B' was not for the purpose of assisting the Board in considering
the merits of
the Application made by Mr Robert Waterhouse but for the predominant and real
purpose of denigrating and discrediting
the Plaintiff and/or to assist the
first Defendant in his efforts to discredit the Plaintiff so that the
Plaintiff's statutory declaration
referred to in 9(a) above, if read to the
Board, would not be accepted".</i>
<P>

8   	It is then next alleged (in paragraph 11 of the Statement
of Claim) that between 1 September and 12 September 1997 "<i>and at other
times</i>" the first and second defendants conspired "<i>to defame the
plaintiff and to abuse the process and procedures of the Board for the purpose
of causing injury to the plaintiff and
his reputation".  </i>This allegation is
particularised as follows:
<P>

<i>"</i><cite>Particulars</cite>
<P>

<i>(a)	At the instigation of both Defendants the first Defendant supplied to
the second Defendant a copy of annexure `B' so that the
second Defendant could
include same in his submissions to the Board dated 12 September 1997 (see
paragraphs 3-8 above).</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	The Defendants in consultation with one another and jointly submitted
annexures `A' and `B' respectively to the Board (see paragraphs
9-10
above).</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	The Defendants knew when they published annexures `A' and `B' to the
Board that such publication was an abuse of the process and
procedures of the
Board".</i>
<P>

9   	The plaintiff claims damages, special damages and
aggravated damages in respect to the counts in defamation and in relation
to
the counts of abuse of process and conspiracy he claims punitive damages.
<P>

10   	On 12 December 1997 the Court dealt with an application by
the defendants in respect of the imputations pleaded as giving
rise to the
causes of action in defamation.  The Court also dealt a contested application
as to whether or not pursuant to SCR Pt
31 r 2 there should be a separate trial
as to whether or not the various publications complained of where protected by
absolute privilege.
 The judgment delivered by me on 12 September 1997 ordered
that there be a Pt 31 hearing.
<P>

11   	On or about 11 December 1997 a Notice of Motion was filed
(on behalf of Waterhouse and adopted by Harris) claiming relief
of the kind I
have outlined.  On the resumed hearing on 6 March 1998 the defendants also
indicated that they proposed to seek to
have struck out the claims for abuse of
process.
<P>

12   	With respect to the imputations said to arise from
Annexure A, in the course of argument on 12 December 1997 those to be relied
upon by the plaintiff resolved themselves into the following: 
<P>

<i>(a)	The plaintiff knowingly made a false statutory declaration.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	The plaintiff solicited a bribe.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	The plaintiff agreed to accept a bribe.</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	</i>(abandoned)
<P>

<i>(e)	The plaintiff in breach of his obligation as a solicitor conspired with
one client to make a false statutory declaration about
another former
client.</i>
<P>

13   	The argument as to capacity of the annexure A to convey
these imputations, in my view, easily can be disposed of.
<P>

14   	Imputation (a) is clearly capable of arising and shall go
to the jury.
<P>

15   	This imputation clearly encapsulates an essential charge
made in the matter complained of.
<P>

16   	As to imputation (b), I find that this imputation is
incapable of arising.  The matter complained of in no way suggests that
the
plaintiff "<i>solicited</i>", that is, sought a bribe.  He was offered a bribe
and accepted it.  The matter complained of certainly indicates that he had to
take certain steps to recover the money consequent upon his agreement to accept
the bribe.  There is no suggestion however that it
was the plaintiff who
initiated the corrupt agreement.  Imputation (b) will not go to the jury.
<P>

17   	Imputation (e), on my reading of the matter arguably can
arise.
<P>

18   	In relation to annexure B the imputations relied upon by
the plaintiff are as follows (paragraph 8):
<P>

<i>"(a)	The plaintiff issued a statement of claim against the second Defendant
knowing that the said claim falsely alleged that the second
Defendant owed some
$155,000.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	The plaintiff conspired with members of the Waterhouse family to abuse
the process of the Court.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	The plaintiff conspired with members of the Waterhouse family to sue the
second Defendant for gambling debts when he knew that
the second Defendant was
not liable to pay them".</i>
<P>

19   	It is contended by the defendants that the imputations do
not differ in substance. 
<P>

20   	I am of the view that imputation (a) is clearly capable of
arising and asserts a single act on the part of the plaintiff in
the issuing of
the Statement of Claim in which the false allegation is made.  Also am I of the
view that imputation (c) is a separate
and distinct charge against the
plaintiff that that which he did as set out in imputation (a) was consequent
upon the conspiracy
with members of the Waterhouse family.  Imputation (b) adds
nothing to either (a) or (c) and does not differ from either or both.
Imputation (b) is struck out a contravening SCR Pt 67 r 11(3).
<P>

21   	Imputations 2(a), (c) and (e);  4(a) and (c);  6(a) and
(c) and 8(a) and (c) are capable of arising.  Imputation 4(b), 6(b)
and 8(b)
are struck out.
<P>

22   	I turn to the substantive application with respect to
absolute privilege which was argued principally on the pleading but
also on the
basis of Exhibit A.  The latter is made up of a letter dated 25 August 1997
from the TRB to Waterhouse.  It refers to
an earlier letter of the first
defendant of 22 August "<i>seeking to give evidence before the Board at its
private hearing concerning the warning off of Mr R W Waterhouse.  The hearing
is
scheduled for 11-12 September 1997".  </i>The first defendant was asked to
provide a written statement of any evidence to the Board in advance of the
hearing;  he was told
that he would be expected to give evidence personally and
be subject to examination on the evidence by members of the Board and by
counsel assisting the Board and Mr R Waterhouse.  He was entitled to have his
own legal representative present to assist with the
presentation of evidence
and to make submissions as to the conclusions which should be drawn from that
evidence.  It was pointed
out to the first defendant that neither he nor
counsel assisting would be permitted to be present during the hearing of
evidence
or submissions from other witnesses including Mr R Waterhouse.
Documents could be tendered by the first defendant relevant to the
matter
before the Board.  The first defendant was not entitled to inspect documents
tendered by others.  The second part of Exhibit
A is Mr David Waterhouse's (the
first defendant) reply which is a letter indicating his preparedness to give
evidence and providing
the members of the NSW TRB with statutory declarations
from 1995 and indicating that he would be relying upon evidence given to the
AJC in December of that year.  Statutory declarations in response to
declarations prepared by other members of the first defendant's
family were
also submitted with the letter of 9 September 1997.
<P>

23   	It was not in dispute before me that the matter with which
the TRB was concerned was an application by Mr Robert Waterhouse
to have lifted
a "<i>warning off</i>" which had it been imposed by the then AJC in the
previous decade, arising as I understand it from what is known as the "<i>Fine
Cotton Affair</i>". 
<P>

24   	It was argued for the defendants that a starting point in
respect of which evidence was not required was the status of the
industry of
the "<i>Turf</i>", in New South Wales, it being one of a multi-billion dollar
nature involving hundreds of thousands of people in employment and as
followers.  It can hardly be disputed that horse racing is "<i>big business in
New South, big business for New South Wales in revenue terms"</i> and <i>"big
business for substantial proportion of the State's population".</i>  As a
matter of general knowledge and common sense, a proposition to this effect my
be accepted.
<P>

25   	The submissions in support of the present application are
concerned with the operation of recent legislation in this State
being formerly
known as the <i>AJC Principal Club Act 1996(</i>No. 37) as amended by the
<i>AJC Principal Club Act 1997</i> (No. 24).  The legislation is now known as
the <i>NSW Thoroughbred Racing Board Act</i>, 1996.
<P>

26   	The historical origins of <i>"warning off,"</i> I am
informed by counsel, are to be found during the reign of Charles II.  More
relevantly it is the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ajca1873224/" class="autolink_findacts">Australian Jockey Club Act 1873</a></i> s 32 of which laid
down appeal procedures to be followed by the Committee of the AJC in cases of
disqualification and "<i>warning off</i>" (s 32(1)(a)(i) and (ii) to (v)).  The
ACJ Act did not define "<i>warning off</i>" but by s 32(5)(a) that Act adopted
the terminology of the Australian Rules of Racing.  A copy of those rules was
provided to me
without objection and in summary AR1 defines "<i>warning
off"</i> as relating to a person who is not permitted to enter a racecourse
under the control of a body warning him off.  AR4 provides that
acts and
decisions of the Committee are final and conclusive;  AR7 identified the
wide-reaching powers and functions of the Committee
in respect of horse racing;
AR175 identified the offences or conduct which may cause the Committee to
impose penalties.  AR182 set
out the substantial impediments suffered by a
person who was disqualified which go much further than merely to bar such a
person
from racecourses and AR183 provided that a warned-off person is subject
to the same conditions and restrictions as a disqualified
person.  AR183E
imposed further restrictions upon a warned off person and that there was
available to the Committee pursuant AR196
power to impose a fine, in addition
to warning off, of up to $50,000.
<P>

27   	The new legislation set up the TRB and vested in it
various functions and powers.  By s 13(a) the Board was given all of the
functions previously exercised by the AJC and the Committee under the Rules of
Racing.  The legislation also gives wide powers to
the Board: s 14(1) providing
that the Board has power to do "<i>all things that may be necessary or
convenient to be done for or in connection with</i>" the exercise of its
functions.  Those functions include, pursuant to s 13(1)(b), the control and
supervision and regulation of horse
racing in the State.  The powers include
supervision of the activities of race clubs, persons licensed by the Board and
"<i>all other persons engaged in or associated with racing</i>" (s 14(2)(c)).
It may prohibit a person from attending at or taking part in a race meeting (s
14(2)(k)) and take such steps and do
such acts and things as are incidental or
conducive to the exercise in the powers and performance of its functions (s
14(2)(w)).
<P>

28   	The Board is specifically empowered by s 14(2)(d) to
inquire into and deal with any matter relating to racing and to refer
any such
matter to Stewards or others for investigation and report.
<P>

29   	It was pursuant to the powers created by s 14 to enable
the performance of the functions referred to in s 13 that the Board
was
authorised to conduct its inquiry into the matter raised by Robert Waterhouse
for the lifting of his "<i>warning off</i>".  To that inquiry both the
defendants were invited to any provided material including the matters
complained of to the Board and
parties connected to the inquiry as alleged.
<P>

30   	The powers exercised by the TRB are exercised pursuant to
statute and the authority to conduct hearings, the power to enforce
its rulings
and penalties have been imposed on the Board by Parliament.  Those powers
cannot be exercised otherwise than in conformity,
it is submitted, with the
principles of natural justice extending procedural fairness to all directly
affected. 
<P>

31   	It is submitted that as the present action clearly
demonstrates these functions cannot be performed unless those performing
them
and others participating in them are free to do so without the fear of the
threats or retribution in the form of the institution
of civil proceedings. 
<P>

32   	In <b><i>Mann v O'Neil </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%2d7%29%20191%20CLR%20204" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996-7) 191 CLR 204</a> at
211-14 the High Court (Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey &amp; Gaudron JJ) spoke of
the fundamental principles to be borne in mind in
the consideration of the
issue before me:
<P>

<i>"It is well settled that absolute privilege attaches to all statements made
in the course of judicial proceedings, whether made by
parties, witnesses,
legal representatives, members of the jury or by the judge. It extends to oral
statements and to statements in
originating process, in pleadings or in other
documents produced in evidence or filed in the proceedings.  It is said that it
extends
to any document published on an "occasion properly incidental [to
judicial proceedings], and necessary for [them]"</i>
<P>

<cite>It is also settled law that absolute privilege attaches to statements
made in the course of quasi-judicial proceedings, ie proceedings
of tribunals
recognised by law and which act "in a manner similar to that in which a Court
of justice acts".</cite><i> Various considerations are relevant to the question
whether proceedings are quasi- judicial. However, </i><cite>the overriding
consideration is "whether there will emerge from the proceedings a
determination the truth and justice of which is
a matter of public
concern</cite><i>". The privilege extends to members of tribunals and to
"advocates, litigants, and witnesses". And its scope is no less extensive
in
other respects than in the case of statements made in the course of judicial
proceedings. </i>
<P>

<i>It is sometimes said that absolute privilege is founded on public</i>
<i>policy considerations. It may be that, so far as concerns</i>
<i>communications between officers of State in the course of their</i>
<i>official duties, absolute privilege attaches by reason of broad</i>
<i>considerations of public policy and convenience. However, a</i> <i>more
precise basis was identified for that aspect of the privilege</i> <i>in
<b>Gibbons v Duffell</b>, it being said in that case that absolute</i>
<i>privilege attaches because it is "indispensable to the effective</i>
<i>performance of ... official functions."... </i>
<P>

<i>And absolute</i> <i>privilege attaches to statements made in the course of
judicial</i> <i>proceedings because it is an indispensable attribute of the
judicial</i> <i>process.  It is necessary that persons involved in judicial</i>
<i>proceedings, whether judge, jury, parties, witnesses or legal</i>
<i>representatives, be able to discharge their duties freely and</i> <i>without
fear of civil action for anything said by them in the course</i> <i>of the
proceedings.  Were civil liability to attach or be</i> <i>capable of attaching,
it would impede inquiry as to the truth and</i> <i>justice of the matter and
jeopardise the "safe administration of</i> <i>justice".</i>
<P>

<i>It may be that the various categories of absolute privilege are all</i>
<i>properly to be seen as grounded in necessity, and not on broader</i>
<i>grounds of public policy. Whether or not that is so, the general</i> <i>rule
is that the extension of absolute privilege is "viewed with the</i> <i>most
jealous suspicion, and resisted, unless its necessity is</i> <i>demonstrated".
Certainly, absolute privilege should not be</i> <i>extended to statements which
are said to be analogous to statements</i> <i>in judicial proceedings unless
there is demonstrated some necessity</i> <i>of the kind that dictates that
judicial proceedings are absolutely</i> <i>privileged".</i>
<P>

33   	(See also <b><i>Trapp v Mackie</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%201%20WLR%20377" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 1 WLR 377</a>;
<b><i>Oliver v Bryant Strata Management Pty Limited </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%2041%20NSWLR%20514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 41 NSWLR 514</a>
at 519.)
<P>

34   	A submission was made that the present Board was created
by the 1996 Act and the amendment Act 1997 which came into effect
on 25 June
1997. Not only were important duties imposed upon it by the Statute, but that
it overtook or usurped those functions previously
performed by the Committee of
the AJC (see s 13(1)(a) and (3)). The Act provides that the Board neither
represents the Crown nor
is directly subject to control by or on behalf of the
government and thus, is it endowed with an independent status and integrity
in
the performance of its functions.
<P>

35   	Section 7 deals with eligibility for membership of the
Board containing grounds of disqualification of a kind that are to
be expected
to be applied in the establishment of the Board to which it was intended to
entrust matters of "<i>public concern</i>". Section 13 and 14 deal with the
functions and powers of the Board as I have referred to above.
<P>

36   	The Board has been not merely recognised by the law but
specifically become a creature of statute to supervise horse racing
in this
State. Special provisions have been made to deal with the status of the Board's
subsidiary creature namely, the Appeal Panel:
see Part VI in Section 43.
<P>

37   	It is acknowledged for the defendants that what the
legislation has failed to deal with is the status of the Board when an
application comes before it otherwise than by way of an appeal. When the Board
is required to hear applications such as that in issue
namely, the application
by Robert Waterhouse to have his "<i>warning off</i>" lifted and to
"<i>judge/determine</i>" that issue, the submission is made that it is acting
as a tribunal recognised by law in all the senses to which reference is made
by
the High Court in <b><i>Mann</i></b> notwithstanding that its status has not
been specifically defined by the legislation.
<P>

38   	The procedures adopted by the Board or sought to be
adopted in Exhibit A are akin to those of a Court of law.  It was to proceed
by
way of a hearing; witnesses were to have been called; witnesses' evidence was
required to be provided first to the officers of
the Board in statement form no
doubt for the assistance of the Board, its counsel and solicitors and parties
interested in the Board's
hearing especially Robert Waterhouse. It can be
clearly inferred from the correspondence that witnesses were subject to
examination
and cross-examination; documents could be tendered by them and
submissions made by those witnesses.
<P>

39   	It is acknowledged that normally the hearings of a Court
of law be public (see <b><i>Scott v Scott</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281913%29%20AC%20417" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1913) AC 417</a>;
<b><i>Nationwide News Pty Limited v District Court of NSW </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2040%20NSWLR%20486" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 40
NSWLR 486).</a>  I am informed, and will take it as no more than that, that
apparently the very hearing fixed for September 1997 was "<i>aborted" </i>by
reason of concern that members, counsel, witnesses and others might be
subjected to law suits or by reason of concern as to whether
or not absolute
privilege applies to its functions in the requisite sense. It is thus contended
that the very fears, if they were
fears, that brought about the suspension of
the hearing have been realised by the institution of these very proceedings.
The "<i>information</i>" as to the suspension of the hearing however cannot
play a determinative role in the coming to a conclusion as to whether the
publications
upon which these defendants have been sued are such as to attract
absolute privilege. The point is made however that the mere fact
that the
tribunal sits <i>"in camera</i>" is equally not determinative that it is not a
tribunal which would otherwise attract the protection of absolute privilege to
its
proceedings. 
<P>

40   	What is here submitted is that it is unarguable that the
proceedings are concerned with the determination of the truth and
justice of a
matter of public concern. The matter of public concern is, shortly stated, the
integrity of the horse racing in New
South Wales.  That public concern should
not be infected by there being permitted to participate in it someone who by
reason of his
character and conduct (if that be the case), could legitimately
give rise to an apprehension in the public as to the integrity of
this
critically important industry. It was argued that the public is entitled to be
protected from such a person by the functioning
of the Board in a
"<i>supervisory</i>" role akin to that of this Court itself in protecting the
public insofar as possible from the incompetence or improprieties of members
of
the legal profession (see <b><i>Re Pempleton </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%201%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 1 NSWLR 1</a> at
7G-8A).
<P>

41   	The decision to "<i>warn off</i>", whether with or without
a fine, or to refuse to lift the "<i>warning off</i>", amount to the same
thing, it is argued, and represents the most severe sanction against a person
which can be imposed by the Board
or under the new regime, the Appeal Panel. It
is the equivalent of the <i>"striking off</i>" of a legal practitioner. An
appeal to the Appeal Panel does not appear from s 42 to exist as of right from
a decision to "<i>warn off any person</i>" (s 42(1)(a)), unless that section
can be construed to include the determination by the Board of an application to
have lifted a
pre-existing "<i>warning off</i>". The appeal panel can sit <i>in
camera</i> or in public, the former when it considers it necessary to do so in
the public interest or to protect the safety of any person (s
43(4)).  As is
not uncommon, it is not bound to act in a formal manner, nor bound by the rules
of evidence and may inform itself
on any matter in any way that it considers to
be just and "<i>is to make its decision on the real merits and justice of the
case and is not bound to follow strict legal precedent"</i> (s 43(3)(c)).
<P>

42   	Thus far notwithstanding the legislation's hiatus in
regard to the pre-existing <i>"warning off</i>" order and the availability of
the option, for example, in the Appeal Panel to hear matters <i>in camera</i>
or in public, the "<i>public concern</i>" component must be the subject of
recognition in the context of principle.
<P>

43   	The extent of the privilege covers all matters which are
done as part of the proceedings being conducted by the TRB. If its
exists it
extends to what is said by the person or persons occupying the positions of
Board members, the parties, counsel or witnesses;
it includes the contents of
all documents put into evidence. The privilege attaches to everything done from
the commencement of the
proceedings onwards including all documents brought
into existence for the purposes of those proceedings and is antecedent to cover
the making of statements by witnesses to a solicitor for the purposes of
identifying the evidence the witness is able to give: <b><i>Watson v
M'Ewam</i></b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1905/1905_7_F_HL_109.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1905] UKHL 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281905%29%20AC%20480" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1905) AC 480</a> (see <i>Gatley, </i><u>Libel &amp; Slander</u> 8th
ed para. 385;<i> Spencer Bower, </i><u>The Law of Actionable Defamation</u> 2nd
ed. Article 28). It is thus submitted that the publication to the Board and its
staff, its counsel and solicitor of material
identifying the evidence which the
two defendants were prepared to give at the hearing and which was given that
the invitation of
the Board itself, falls within the umbrella of the privilege.
It is to be taken that the body which imposed the "<i>warning off</i>" and
which I am informed refused all previous appeals and like applications by
Robert Waterhouse, namely the AJC, had a special interest
in the application
which he had then made to the Board; it was a legal person with a special and
direct interest in the proceedings
before the Board which would obviously be
entitled to be heard on the application (see <b><i>John Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty
Limited v Police Tribunal of NSW &amp; Anor</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 465</a> at
482C-D), and thus the publication to its Chief Executive Officer, Mr King,
should also be protected.
<P>

44   	It can be seen that special emphasis is placed by the
defendants on that component of principle enunciated by the High Court
in
<b><i>Mann</i></b> concerning a determination the truth and justice of which is
a matter of public concern.  I hasten to add that this was not at the
expense
of the components of proceedings of tribunals <i>"recognised by law</i>" and
which act in a manner similar to that in which a Court of justice acts.
<P>

45   	For the plaintiff Mr Rollinson did not "<i>pretend</i>"
that the description of the TRB for the purpose of this case is a tribunal
could be questioned. He did not <i>"pretend</i>" that it is other than one
recognised by law; it is established by law. He did not "<i>pretend</i>" that
the TRB is not capable of acting in a manner similar to that of a court of
justice. The point Mr Rollinson made was that there
was no obligation on that
tribunal to act in a manner in which a Court of justice acts in the disposition
of the Robert Waterhouse
inquiry or indeed, in any other matter. The functions
of the Board are as set out in s 13. The powers of the Board are set out in
s
14. Section 19(1) provides that the Board <i>"may regulate its proceedings as
it considers appropriate subject to this section".</i> (The section then goes
on to deal with the requirement for quorum and voting.)
<P>

46   	The Board may elect to act in a Court-like manner and it
is conceded by the plaintiff that there is evidence in this case
that to some
extent it has elected, in the disposition of the Robert Waterhouse matter, to
proceed in a Court-like manner.  However
that is an exercise in free choice on
the part of the Board of which it can repent at any time for any reason. Even
if it be the
case as conceded by the plaintiff that for the Robert Waterhouse
matter the Board has chosen to act in a manner similar of that of
a Court of
justice, its continuing to do so is entirely in the hands of the Board. 
<P>

47   	Further it is acknowledged that any change in that
procedure will, of course, give rise to considerations of natural justice
or
procedural fairness or their abuse.  In this context particular reference is
made to the statements of McHugh J in <b><i>Mann v O'Neil</i> </b>at 224-227.
His Honour cited the following passage from <b><i>Trapp v Mackie</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%201%20WLR%20377" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979)
1 WLR 377</a> at 379 per Diplock LJ: 
<P>

<i>"to decide whether a tribunal acts in a manner similar to courts of justice
and thus is of such a kind as will attract absolute, as
distinct from
qualified, privilege for witnesses when they give testimony before it, one must
consider first, under what authority
the tribunal acts, secondly the nature of
the question into which it is its duty to inquire; thirdly the procedure
adopted by it
in carrying out the inquiry; and fourthly the legal consequences
of the conclusion reached by the tribunal as a result of the inquiry."</i>
<P>

48   	His Honour then went on to say:
<P>

<i>"The presence of a statutory scheme establishing the tribunal and regulating
its procedures has been viewed as an important guide
in determining whether the
tribunal is "recognised by law" for the purposes of the defence of absolute
privilege. This is because
the statutory detail allows the court more readily
to determine whether the tribunal has the trappings of a court. Relevant
matters
on this issue include whether provision is made for inter-parties
proceedings, for the calling of witnesses and receiving evidence
on oath, for
public hearings, and for legal representation. In addition, the statutory
detail will often describe the tribunal's
initiating mechanisms and the legal
consequences of its determinations".</i>
<P>

49   	His Honour went on to remark that a tribunal would be
characterised as recognised by law <i>"only where a clear case is
established</i>". His Honour observed that the decision in <b><i>Royal Aquarium
Society Limited v Parkinson</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281892%29%201%20QB%20431" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1892) 1 QB 431</a> in relation to applications
for music and dancing licences to the London County Council not being subject
to absolute privilege would
still be decided in the same way today (at 227).
His Honour came to this view after the consideration of the application of
rules
of natural justice to non-curial tribunals and the attention that notion
had received at first instance and on appeal by Carr J of
the Full Court in
<b><i>Mann</i></b> itself. His Honour particularly observed at 227: 
<P>

<i>"Moreover, it should not be overlooked that the suggested equation works two
ways. Given its drastic effect in foreclosing all means
of redress for
defamatory remarks made maliciously, the potential widespread availability of
the defence of absolute privilege might
itself provide a disincentive to
applying the rules of natural justice to new forms of tribunals".</i>
<P>

50   	Thus, as I understood the submissions, the point is
reached on an examination of the legislation it makes no specific provision
as
to the conduct of the Board in its inquiry in the Robert Waterhouse matter or
indeed, any other. Whilst it has clothed itself
with at least some of the
attributes of a Court of justice, it is not obliged to do so and can change
those attributes at its whim.
Any such change would offend the rules of natural
justice. The application of the rules of natural justice, do not, as McHugh J
observed,
equate with the application of the protection of absolute privilege.

<P>

51   	Whilst the concession is in effect made that by reason of
the material contained in Exhibit A (the correspondence with Mr
David
Waterhouse) attributes of a Court of justice in terms of procedure are adopted
for the purposes of the Robert Waterhouse inquiry,
closer examination of them
does not elevate the steps that the TRB has decided to take for this purpose as
"<i>constituting</i>" statutory detail that would even allow the Court more
readily to determine the nature and degree of "<i>trappings</i>" the Board
possesses.
<P>

52   	To paraphrase Mr Rollinson's submissions in this context,
the TRB in a transient way has adopted some of the trappings of
a Court of
justice on an "<i>ad hoc</i>" basis to deal with the Robert Waterhouse
application to remove the <i>"warning off"</i>. By itself, it is submitted,
this cannot bring the TRB as a <i>"tribunal</i>" within a category as a
tribunal recognised by law. Whilst there may emerge from the
"<i>proceedings"</i> of the TRB a determination the truth and justice of which
is a matter of public concern, the "<i>ad hoc</i>" nature of the decision to
apply some of the "<i>trappings" </i>of a Court of justice are insufficient
fully to satisfy the criteria for the application of the doctrine of absolute
privilege as
enunciated by the High Court in the judgments referred to. Indeed,
Mr Rollinson suggested that the subject matter of "<i>public concern"</i>
namely, whether or not Mr Robert Waterhouse should be no longer "<i>warned
off</i>" amounts to no more than the granting of the dancing licence in the
<b><i>Royal Aquarium</i></b> case.
<P>

53   	Furthermore, analysis discloses that neither of the
defendants are a party to the proceedings; they are not compellable (though
that is not determinative), nor can they compel the Board to attend any such
testimony or material they place before it. Indeed,
both defendants can
themselves repent of any intention to give evidence or communicate by the
provision of documentary material with
the TRB.
<P>

54   	The decision of the legislature in setting up the Board
and the Appeal Panel at the same time is to be noted; but what particularly
is
to be emphasised is that in respect of the Appeal Panel the Act is far clearer
in the procedural respects (s 43) than it is in
relation to the TRB itself.
Furthermore, the second schedule in clause 2.3 provides that the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation
Act 1974</a> </i>is amended in its Schedule 2 relating to proceedings of public
concern and official and public documents and records in the context
of
absolute privilege to include an appeal to the Appeal Panel under the AJC
principal Act 1996 (Mr Rollinson referred me to the
views I expressed but in a
different context about the structure of the TRB in <b><i>Waterhouse v David
Syme &amp; Co &amp; Ors</i></b> (unreported, 24 February 1998).
<P>

55   	Thus, in summary, taking into account what I have
described as the "<i>ad hoc</i>" application of some of the trappings of a
Court of justice, the non-equation of the availability of remedies for breach
of the rules
of natural justice or procedural fairness with the existence of
absolute privilege and a specific statutory provision in relation
to the Appeal
Panel, notwithstanding the nature of the concessions made and the effect on Mr
Robert Waterhouse of any decision of
the TRB, and notwithstanding the nature
and extent of the horse racing industry with which the TRB is in a general way
concerned,
the criteria properly applied have not been satisfied for the
application of the "<i>immunity"</i> as Gummow J described it in his judgment
in <b><i>Mann</i></b>. This is a case where the requisite degree of
"<i>clarity</i>" has not been established (cf. McHugh J in <b><i>Mann</i></b>
at 225).
<P>

56   	The arguments for the plaintiff cannot lightly be
dismissed. The submissions in relation to the legislation as it existed
in
March 1998 were well founded insofar as the schedule to legislation did purport
to amend the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a> </i>in its Schedule 2 in the manner
indicated.
<P>

57   	I am persuaded however overall by the arguments advanced
for the defendants. Notwithstanding that at the relevant time the
TRB had a
wide range of powers <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 14)</a>, the exercise of power for the purposes of the
inquiry into whether or not Robert Waterhouse's <i>"warning off</i>" should be
lifted was being conducted under the authority of the legislation. Further, the
nature of the question into which the
TRB was inquiring, namely whether or not
the <i>"warning off</i>" should be lifted was one not akin to whether or not a
license to hold a dance should be granted but rather one that affected the
profession, standing, reputation and integrity of a member of the community
generally and of the racing community in particular and
his rights to operate
as a person within that community. The procedure adopted, ad hoc as it was as I
have described it, was certainly
akin to that of a Court of justice adopting
some but not all of the trappings (not all have to be adopted). The consequence
of the
conclusion reached by the Board as a result of the inquiry would be
legal in its nature affecting in the sense of depriving (if the
decision was
adverse to Robert Waterhouse) that person of rights available to him<i>, inter
alia</i>, under the legislation itself under which the inquiry was being
conducted. In the overall context to which I believe sufficient reference
has
been made in the course of these reasons, the interests of <i>"justice</i>" and
the conduct of the inquiry by the tribunal into so weighty a matter commands
that people participating, even by invitation,
should be free to do so without
the threat of oppressive litigation.
<P>

58   	I am of the view therefore that at common law the defence
of absolute privilege is available to the defendant's in respect
of the
publications to the Board and its officers including counsel and its
solicitors.
<P>

59   	I am similarly of the view that the publications
complained of were in the course of inquiry made under an authority of an
Act
was provided for by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s18.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 18</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a></i>.
<P>

60   	It is to be noted however that by reason of further
amendments to the <i>Thoroughbred Racing Board Act</i> by the <i>Thoroughbred
Racing Board Amendment Act 1998,</i> the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a></i> has been
amended now specifically to provide in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s17db.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 17DB</a> a defence of absolute privilege
for a publication in the course of proceedings in respect of an inquiry
conducted by the NSW Thoroughbred
Racing Board.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s17da.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 17DA</a> provides a
similar protection in respect to the Appeal Panel.
<P>

61   	There remains however the matter of publication by the
first defendant to the second defendant. I do not see how absolute
privilege
attaches to this publication. Certainly qualified privilege would be an
arguable defence subject to <i>"reasonableness</i>" for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 22</a>
and the availability of <i>"malice</i>" at common law.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s13.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 13</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a></i> would have some application one would think.
<P>

62   	Publication to the Board is relied upon as founding the
counts of abuse of process against the first and second defendants.
As pleaded,
I cannot see any rational basis for coming to the view that this allegation is
arguable. As those two paragraphs will
be struck out it is inevitable that the
curiously pleaded paragraph 12 which purports to allege some common law
conspiracy to defame
and to abuse the process of the Court must also go. I
acknowledge that I heard no submissions in relation to the difficult tort of
conspiracy but in any event I will strike paragraph 11 out as embarrassing on
the basis that it now appears that the process is available
and secondly, the
count seems to roll up in the context of the tort of conspiracy an agreement to
do separate things which presumably
would be proved to have damaged the
plaintiff one of which is not available and the other of which is still viable
to the extent
that the serious allegations constituted by the remaining
imputations are available in terms of publication by the first defendant
to the
second defendant.
<P>

63   	What remains of this litigation, if it is to be pursued,
can be dealt with appropriately by the District Court.
<P>

64   	The claim for punitive damages is struck out.
<P>

65   	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	Imputations 2(a), (c) and (e) are capable of arising and will go to the

12.	After the Australian Jockey Club hearing in 1195/1996, I discovered two
pieces of information concerning the circumstances of
that hearing.  They
are:
<P>

(a)	In March 1996 I went to Diethnes Restaurant in Castlereagh Street at about
3.30pm to collect a barrister friend of mine, Peter
Searle who resided in
Melbourne and who had requested me to drive him to Sydney airport.  When I
arrived, he was just having his
after lunch coffee.  He was in the presence of
Phillip Pollack (a solicitor who had acted previously for my family and myself
over
the years) and a former client of Pollack, now a client of Peter Searle.
I then had the following conversation with Pollack:
<P>

<i>DW:	`Phillip, what was going on?  Your name was bandied around at the AJC.
Robbie's barrister, McAlary was suggesting that I sent
you around to their
office to blackmail them over the family trust.  McAlary even tried to pretend
he had a Statutory Declaration
from you.</i>
<P>

<i>POLLACK:	David, I'm sorry.  I was desperate for money.  I can't practice any
more as a solicitor - I am about to got bankrupt any
day. Robbie offered me
$50,000 cash to do a false Statutory Declaration which I did.  It had to say in
it that instead of being at
their office trying to talk some sense to them to
take you out of the defamation action </i>(referred o matter No. 11530/91
referred to in paragraph 9(a) above)<i> that they had joined you into, that
you'd sent me along there to blackmail them and get money from them on the
trust.  I was and
am absolutely desperate and I said OK if I got the money
before hand.</i>
<P>

<i>DW:	How, what?</i>
<P>

<i>POLLACK:	Robbie got me to give him a false Statutory Declaration and he took
me to McAlary but I know Robbie too well.  Once I gave
the evidence in the box,
I wouldn't be getting anything.  Robbie then offered a compromise - $25,000 now
and $25,000 after I was
supposed to give the evidence.  When Robbie kept on
dodging paying the first $25,000, this was well after I did the Statutory
Declaration
for him, I knew I wouldn't get anything.  Obviously, Robbie didn't
have the $25,000 at the time because he was that desperate for
me to give this
bullshit - if he had the $25,000 he would have paid it".</i>
<P>

<i>DW:	Phillip, I can't believe you'd admit to me now in front of Peter Searle
such a terrible thing.  Later today I intend to contact
the AJC's solicitor and
tell her the whole of this conversation.  I will never had anything further to
do with you whatsoever.  Peter,
I will wait outside for you.</i>
<P>

<i>POLLACK:	Hang on David, I didn't do it, don't involve me.  I've got all the
troubles in the world, so leave me out of it.</i>
<P>

Later that same day, I telephoned Ms Joanne Kelly of Murphy &amp; Maloney, the
solicitor for the Australian Jockey Club and repeated
this conversation to
her.
<P>

<P>

I now rely upon an affidavit given to my solicitors by David Waterhouse, but
not yet filed, to fill in what happened next.  It states:
 "In or about early
March 1986 R Waterhouse said to me (David) words to the following effect
concerning the criminal charges he was
facing:
<P>

RW:	I'm going to blame Mick Sayers (murdered in 1985) as being the organiser of
the Fine Cotton ring-in.  Kevin Perkins will help
me.  He is prepared to run
with it as it is a believable story.
<P>

DW:	I think you will find Mick Sayers was in jail at the time.
<P>

RW:	No, as luck had it, he got out 2 days beforehand.
<P>

Robert Waterhouse then caused his shoulders to expand outwards and jokingly
said:  "I hope he's got big shoulders to carry all this".
<P>

In or about mid March 1986 my brother said words to the following effect to me:
"Arthur Harris has accumulated a lot of information
on me and about Fine
Cotton.  He may be troublesome.  I'm worried that he will bring me unstuck over
Sayers".
<P>

Page 2.
<P>

Later in March 1986 I was present in the offices of solicitor Phillip Pollack
when my brother and father were discussing Arthur
Harris.  My brother R. W.
Waterhouse said words to the effect:  "I will shut Harris up.  I'll sue him for
old gambling debts.  Even
though we have compromised and settled, I will get
away with it because Arthur doesn't have it in writing.  It's over $100,000.
Morgan
Ryan said Harris would be too worried about being declared a defaulter
and warned-off.  It will scare him and shut him up".
<P>

DW:	You told me how lucky you were to compromise and settle with Arthur Harris
after you were warned-off.   You told me you were
square.  Keith Jones did the
settling.
<P>

RW:	Don't worry.  Keith Jones won't go near a witness box.  Harris won't be
able to prove we are square.
<P>

My father (Bill Waterhouse) then said to Phillip Pollack "What do you think we
should do?"
<P>

RW:	(before Pollack answered) Let's vote.
<P>

Phillip Pollack:	I wouldn't.  The downside is that if you sue someone, you may
spur them on.
<P>

My father said:	Keith Jones may get in the box.  He certainly won't do you a
favour.
<P>

DW:	I'm totally against it.
<P>

RW:	Morgan's assured me that's the best way to shut Harris up.  I'm going to do
it.
<P>

He then said to Phillip Pollack `I want you to sue him'.
<P>

I was subsequently served at Rosehill races on 10 May <u>1986</u> by Phillip
Pollack, with a statement of claim relating to bets made in the first week of
January <u>1984</u> amounting to some $155,000.  I was greatly distressed,
shocked and annoyed.  I saw Gai Waterhouse and said to her words to this
effect:
 "Where's that flea of a husband of yours?"
<P>

Gai: 	"At home".
<P>

AH:	"Tell him if he continues like this he will end up in jail and I will have
put him there".
<P>
