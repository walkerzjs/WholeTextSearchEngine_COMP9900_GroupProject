<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Imputations - capacity &amp; form- joinder)</b>
<P>

1	By an Amended Statement of Claim filed on 29 October 1997 the plaintiff sues
the first defendant as the publisher of "<i>The Sunday Age</i>" in respect of
an article published on 28 September 1997.  It is said in paragraph 3 of the
pleading that the first and third defendants
published that material.  
<P>

2	The matter complained of bears the headline "<i>Dead Heat- Who Killed George
Brown?"</i> and the by-line of Andrew Rule.  It is 107 paragraphs in length.
<P>

3	The plaintiff contends that that matter complained of conveys of him the
following imputations:
<P>

	<i>"(a)	The plaintiff is a murderer.</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	The plaintiff is a torturer.</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	The plaintiff caused the murder of George Brown.</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	The plaintiff caused the torture of George Brown.</i>
<P>

<i>	(e)	The plaintiff sent two men around to teach George Brown a lesson by
violence".</i>
<P>

4	The second defendant (Fairfax) is sued in respect of a publication in <i>"The
Sun-Herald"</i> of 28 September 1997 said (in paragraph 5) to have been
published by the second and third defendants or to be caused to be
published.
<P>

5	The article bears the headline "<i>George Brown's Friends Are Still Terrified
Today But All Agree - He Died Because He Failed To Substitute A Horse";  </i>it
also has the by-line of Andrew Rule and can fairly be described as an
abbreviated version (being 66 paragraphs) of the article
published in <i>"The
Age"</i>.  
<P>

6	The plaintiff contends that this matter complained of conveys the same five
imputations relied upon in respect of the first publication.
<P>

7	The Particulars of Publication as far as the third defendant is concerned
are:
<P>

	<i>"The words attributed to the third defendant in annexure `A' were published
by him to the first defendant's journalists including
Andrew Rule with the
knowledge that such words would be re-published or would be likely to be
re-published in the newspaper.</i>
<P>

<i>	The words attributed to the third defendant in annexure `B' were published
by him to the second defendant defendant's journalists
with the knowledge that
such words would be re-published or would be likely to be re-published in the
newspaper".</i>
<P>

8	It is the third defendant (Harris) who moves the Court for relief in relation
to this pleading in two areas:  first, the imputations
both as to form and
capacity and, secondly, his joinder as a defendant.
<P>

9	The first and second defendants while their legal representatives were in
Court during the argument did not participate and are
content to abide the
outcome of Mr Harris' motions.
<P>

10	A subsidiary point taken by Mr Harris and a valid one is the form of the
pleading itself in terms of the legibility of the annexures.
 Appended to the
Amended Statement of Claim are what purports to be photocopies of the relevant
articles.  Both simply are illegible
and despite endeavouring to read them so
as the better to understand the submissions made, I was unable to do so until
Mr Rollinson
of counsel was good enough to provide me with transcribed versions
on 26 November 1998.  In the event of the plaintiff being granted
leave to file
any Further Amended Statement of Claim it will a requirement that the matters
complained of be appended in transcript
form thereto (see <b><i>Stewart v
Shoalhaven &amp; Nowra News Pty Limited</i></b> (Hunt J, unreported, 26
September 1980); <b><i>Campbell v Regional Publishers Pty Limited</i></b>
(Levine J, unreported, 30 October 1998 at pp 14-15)).
<P>

11	Mr Harris provided me with a bundle of correspondence constituted by an
exchange of letters between himself and the solicitors
for the plaintiff
raising various matters in dispute, and the exchange of the request for and
supply of particulars between the solicitors
for the plaintiff and the
solicitors for the first and second defendants.  One thing is clear, as was
pointed out was by Mr Harris,
that there is no coincidence in the
identification of the part or parts of the matter complained of relied upon by
the plaintiff
vis-a-vis each defendant.  In the end I do not think anything
really turns on that for the purposes of the present application. 
It is
certainly clear from a consideration of the relevant letters, and bearing in
mind the different length and form of the respective
articles, that essentially
the same material is relied upon and particularly the parts in which words are
attributed to the third
defendant, Mr Harris.
<P>

12	The first point, as I understood it, made by Mr Harris is that objection is
taken to the generality of imputations (a) and (b).
 It is argued that if the
matter complained of is capable of conveying anything to the effect of such
imputations, it is that the
plaintiff murdered George Brown and/or the
plaintiff tortured George Brown.  Considering these imputations, as-it-were, in
isolation,
I see no point in the submission made by Mr Harris in this regard.
As a matter of fact in the real world if the plaintiff murdered
George Brown
the plaintiff would be a murderer;  if the plaintiff tortured George Brown the
plaintiff would be a torturer.  I shall
return to these imputations in respect
of another basis upon which they are attacked.
<P>

13	As to imputation (c) and (d) in each case they will be struck out.  The use
of the word "<i>caused</i>" is so imprecise to be embarrassing.
<P>

14	As to imputation (e):  I see no defect in form, nor do I see any
inconsistency as a matter of pleading (subject to what appears
below) between
what is involved in this imputation and what is involved in imputations (a) and
(b).  
<P>

15	It is the next submission made by Mr Harris that is determinative, in my
view.  The submission, shortly stated, is the submission
often described as the
"<i>guilt/suspicion</i>" submission founded in that line of authority
<b><i>Lewis v Daily Telegraph Limited </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20AC%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) AC 234</a>;  <b><i>Mirror
Newspapers Limited v Harrison </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/50.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 50</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20293" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR 293</a> recently the subject
of discussion and analysis by Hunt CJ at CL in <b><i>Amalgamated Television
Services v Marsden </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20158" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 158</a> at 167B (see also Levine J
<b><i>Rivkin v John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited</i></b>(unreported, 18
September 1998).
<P>

16	What the articles make quite clear is that George Brown was tortured and
murdered.  The second matter complained of bears a sub-headline
"<i>Special
Investigation</i>", the first matter complained of asks the question "<i>Who
Killed George Brown</i>?"<i>.  </i>Both articles, in my view, clearly convey
the themes of investigation, suspicion, rumour, silence, fear and
speculation.
<P>

17	In <b><i>Marsden</i></b> his Honour said:
<P>

	<i>"The publisher is not held responsible, for example, for an inference which
the ordinary reasonable reader, listener or viewer draws
from an inference
already drawn from the matter complained of, because it is unreasonable for the
publisher to be held so responsible:
Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd (at 259-260,
274, 286); Mirror Newspapers Ltd v Harrison (at 299-300). That is an issue
which has assumed
some importance in this case.</i>
<P>

<i>	It is necessary to emphasise the important distinction between an
implication and an inference. An implication is included in and
is part of that
which is expressed by the publisher. It is something which the reader (or
listener or viewer) understands the publisher
as having intended to say. An
inference is something which the reader (or listener or viewer) adds to what is
stated by the publisher;
it may reasonably or even irresistibly follow from
what has been expressly or impliedly said, but it is nevertheless a conclusion
drawn by the reader (or listener or viewer) from what has been expressly or
impliedly said by the publisher: cf Lubrano v Gollin
and Co Pty Ltd <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1919/61.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1919] HCA 61</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281919%29%2027%20CLR%20113" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1919) 27
CLR 113</a> at 118; Rose v Hvric <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1963/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1963] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281963%29%20108%20CLR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1963) 108 CLR 353</a> at 358. It is the reader's (or
listener's or viewer's) own conclusion. Attention to this distinction, in the
context of the capacity
to defame issue, seems to have been drawn for the first
time in my judgment in Bargold Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20NSWLR%209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 NSWLR 9</a>
at 12, when I pointed out that such a distinction appeared to have been
accepted by Lord Devlin in Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 234</a> at
279-280: see Bargold Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20NSWLR%209" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 NSWLR 9</a> at 12.
That distinction was subsequently accepted in that context by this Court in
Harrison v Mirror Newspapers Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20NSWLR%20620" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 NSWLR 620</a> at 627. The High Court
found it unnecessary to discuss the distinction in the appeal to that court in
Mirror Newspapers Ltd v Harrison
(at 300), and the distinction therefore
stands.</i>
<P>

<i>	An inference is drawn from an inference when the reader, listener or viewer
draws an inference which is available in the matter complained
of and then uses
that inference as a basis (at least in part) from which a further inference is
drawn. The publisher is held responsible
for the first of those inferences but
not for the second because -- as I have already said -- it is unreasonable for
the publisher
to be held so responsible. In Mirror Newspapers Ltd v Harrison
(at 300), the High Court illustrated the process which leads to an
inference
upon an inference in the case where the matter complained of states that the
plaintiff had been charged with an offence.
The first inference available from
that statement (for which the publisher is held responsible) is that the police
believed the plaintiff
to be guilty or had a ground for charging him. (The
phrase "reasonable cause" is substituted for "ground" at page 301.) The second
inference, which is based at least in part upon that first inference (and thus
is not one for which the publisher is held responsible
because it is
unreasonable to do so), is that the plaintiff is in fact guilty of the offence
charged. (The cases referred to by the
High Court are Lang v Australian
Consolidated Press Ltd and Rochfort v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%201%20NSWLR%2016" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1972] 1
NSWLR 16.)</a> That requirement of reasonableness must apply in every case. There
can, however, be no unreasonableness involved in making the publisher
responsible for an inference drawn by the reader (or listener or viewer) from a
statement which the publisher is reasonably understood
to have intended to
imply in the matter complained of".</i>
<P>

18	I agree with Mr Harris' submissions that to reach a point constituted by an
allegation of guilt involves multiple inference drawing
by an ordinary
reasonable reader, the commencing point would be the fact that the late George
Brown trained the horse Risley.  From
that, as I read the matter complained of
and understand Mr Harris' submissions the process of inference drawing would
then pass from
that to the connection between the event, the odds on the race,
the knowledge of the plaintiff of those matters, the fact that the
plaintiff is
said to have bet on the race and so on and so on.  This is particularly the
case in relation to the first matter complained
of.  The problems are
aggravated by the second in which the plaintiff is not named.
<P>

19	It is argued by Mr Harris that the inference upon inference problem
confronts the plaintiff in coming to an imputation of suspicion.
 Thus far the
plaintiff has not pleaded such an imputation.  That argument might well be of
merit though the general theme of the
matters complained of to which I have
referred must be taken into account.  
<P>

20	I am persuaded by Mr Harris' submissions in this regard and will hold that
imputations (a), (b) and (d) will not go to the jury.
<P>

21	Finally, there is the question asked by Mr Harris:  why am I a party to this
action?  The short answer is that the plaintiff's
have alleged him to be a
"<i>publisher</i>".  There may be other answers that are irrelevant to the
formal structure of this litigation.
<P>

22	No doubt those advising the plaintiff had in mind the classic statement of
liability for the tort of defamation in <b><i>Webb v Bloch</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1928/50.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1928] HCA 50</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281928%29%2041%20CLR%20331" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1928) 41
CLR 331</a> at 364 per Isaacs J and the considerations raised in <b><i>Cook v South
Australian Trotting Association</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/sa/SAStRp/1930/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1930] SAStRp 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281930%29%20SASR%20166" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1930) SASR 166</a> particularly at 178 per
Montague-Smith J.
<P>

23	Mr Harris argues that the words attributed to him, although relied upon by
the plaintiff vis-a-vis himself as the third defendant,
and are relied upon,
together with other passages as giving rise to defamatory imputations,
themselves are incapable of giving rise
to any.
<P>

24	Given the state of the pleading as a result of the orders I am making as to
the currently pleaded imputations, that proposition
cannot be resolved.
Indeed, subject to the nature of any amended imputations the plaintiff chooses
to plead, I cannot see otherwise
than that the resolution of this issue should
take place at the trial.  It is for the plaintiff to prove his case against the
third
defendant as a publisher and tortfeasor.  Whether in the end the
plaintiff will be able to prove his case on that component will
seriously be in
issue I have no doubt.  At present however, I am not persuaded that there
exists any basis for staying or otherwise
disposing of the proceedings between
the plaintiff and Mr Harris as third defendant.
<P>

25	The formal orders therefore are:
<P>

1.	Imputations 4(a), (b) and (e);  6(a), (b) and (e) will not go to the
jury.
<P>

2.	Imputations 4(c) and (d);  6(c) and (d) are struck out.
<P>

3.	The plaintiff has liberty to file a Further Amended Statement of Claim
within 21 days.
<P>

4.	The plaintiff is to pay any costs and expenses incurred by Mr Harris in
respect of the hearing of Mr Harris' applications.
<P>

5.	The first and second defendants are to pay their own costs of Mr Harris'
applications.
<P>

6.	At the expiry of 21 days the parties have liberty, a Further Amended
Statement of Claim having been filed, to file, by consent,
within 14 days
thereafter, orders and directions for the further conduct of this matter.
<P>

7.	At the expiry of the 14 days referred to in Order 6, liberty to restore to
the Defamation List on 3 days notice.
