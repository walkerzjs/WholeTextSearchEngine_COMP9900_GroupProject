<b>2465/98 - JUNE ANNE SCOTTS v ADELBERTUS ANTHONIUS MARIA</b>
<P>

<b>KLEVERLAAN - ESTATE OF ALYS JOAN YOUNG &amp; ANOR </b>
<P>

 
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

 
<P>

1  	MASTER:    This is an application in respect of the estate of the
late Alys Young who died on 2 August 1997.  The deceased was
survived by her
daughter, the plaintiff, a number of step children and other relatives.  Under
her will, which was made on 15 February
1993, she left her estate equally
between the plaintiff, her daughter, Ronald Keith Young, her stepson, and
Joanne Christine Key,
her niece, and Valerie Judith Barrow, her
stepdaughter.
<P>

2  	      The estate consisted of a unit which has been sold.  The
distributable estate is $215,753.71.  Costs have been incurred
in this matter
on the defendant's behalf in the sum of $11,000 and on the plaintiff's behalf
in the sum of $9,500.  Of the distributable
estate one is left with $195,253.
Each beneficiary would therefore take in the order of $48,813.
<P>

3  	      I will give a little bit of the history before dealing with
some of the other matters that have to be considered: The
plaintiff was born on
29 June 1931.  She was the only child of the deceased and the deceased's first
husband. Valerie Barrow, one
of the beneficiaries, was born on 17 December
1932.  She was a daughter of Mr Keith Young.  In 1934 the plaintiff's father
died.
 Also in 1934 on 15 August Ronald was born, the son of Keith Young.
<P>

4  	      The deceased and Keith Young commenced cohabitation at de
facto partners in the 1940s.  The precise time is a matter of
some dispute, the
plaintiff suggesting that it was between 1940 and 1943, and Ronald, who seemed
to have a reasonably clear recollection,
seemed to suggest 1949.  I think that
probably is more likely.  At that stage of course the deceased had one
daughter, who is the
plaintiff, and Mr Keith Young had two children, Valerie
and Ronald.
<P>

5  	     Initially, probably for some years, Valerie and Ronald had
been living with their mother.  In 1949 and 1951, according
to Ronald, he
resided with the deceased and his father, Keith Young.  Although there were
times when he was away during that period,
I think his recollection is probably
more accurate than the plaintiff's and I accept that he lived there in that
time.
<P>

6  	     Valerie, who lived with her mother, did not join the
household which was comprised of the deceased and Mr Young.
<P>

7  	     The plaintiff in 1944 commenced her education at Brigidine
Convent and completed that in 1948.  She then obtained the leaving
certificate
and commenced nursing at Royal Prince Alfred hospital.  On 25 December 1945
John Flynn, a nephew of the deceased who
is one of the executors of the
deceased's will, was born on and 29 December 1952 Joanne Christine Key was
born.  She was the daughter
of the deceased's sister and thus a niece of the
deceased.
<P>

8  	     In 1954 the plaintiff married Robert Sydney Scotts.
Following her marriage, she and Mr Scotts moved into the home until
1973.
Eventually between them they had eight children.  At a time which is also
disputed on the evidence Maria Flynn, a sister of
the deceased, died, leaving
three children, Joanne Key, Terrence and John, who is a coexecutor of the will
of the deceased.  There
is one version of 1955 and another of 1962.
<P>

9  	     It seems that even before the death of Maria Flynn the
deceased and Mr Young would spend a substantial amount of time looking
after
the family and this was because Maria Flynn apparently was quite sick.  After
she died the deceased and Mr Young moved in with
the children and brought them
up in their household.  In effect, the deceased and Mr Young started a second
family after having raised
their children beforehand.  Apparently in 1960 the
deceased and Mr Young married.
<P>

10  	     Between 1968 and 1969 they and the family moved to the
northern beaches and lived there during that period.  In 1989 the
deceased and
Mr Young purchased a retirement unit in a retirement village at 82 Avalon
Parade, Avalon, and shortly after that the
deceased became ill.
<P>

11  	     At this stage the plaintiff and her husband provided
assistance for the deceased.  They paid for some ten weeks of accommodation
in
a private nursing home at a cost of some $8,000.  The plaintiff in this period,
and indeed from 1972, with her husband enjoyed
success as property developers
and they had an affluent lifestyle in Palm Beach and had assets worth many
millions of dollars.  It
was in this period that the plaintiff suggested to the
deceased that it would be inappropriate for her to take anything under her
mother's will.
<P>

12  	     Unfortunately things changed for the plaintiff in 1991. She
and her husband suffered complete financial ruin.  They had
been successful
property developers and went into a development with the bank which
unfortunately did not succeed, due to a fall
in property values.  Effectively
they lost everything, including their home.
<P>

13  	     Matters didn't stop there because unfortunately the
plaintiff's husband then deserted her and her marriage of some forty
years
duration was finished.
<P>

14  	     In 1991 Keith Young became quite ill and moved into a
nursing home and died in late 1992.
<P>

15  	     At about this time both the plaintiff and the deceased
joined the Avalon RSL club and contact was maintained between the
plaintiff and
the deceased from then until her death. Certainly there were occasions when the
plaintiff and the deceased were together
for a number of days during this
period and indeed even prior to this the plaintiff travelled fairly extensively
and was often away
for a month or more at a time.  In these circumstances, a
lot of the burden of looking after and assisting the deceased fell on Joanne
Key.
<P>

16  	      On 15 February 1993 the deceased made her last will and on
that occasion the change was suggested to Joanne that half
of her share should
pass to the plaintiff because of her changed situation.
<P>

17  	      In 1996 the deceased's health failed and she eventually
was accommodated in Greenwich Hospital and she died on 12 August
1997.
<P>

18  	      In matters such as this the High Court has in Singer V
Berghouse, (1981) CLR 201 at 209, set out the approach that the
Court must
take.
<P>

19  	      As directed by the High Court I turn to consider what the
plaintiff's present situation is.  She has a car which is an
eleven year old
Mercedes 190 and various furniture and effects.  Apart from this she has
absolutely no assets.  Her medical benefits
or health cover is provided and she
receives a pension of $436.80 per fortnight and earns about $100 per fortnight
from baby sitting.
 She is presently 68 years of age and over recent years she
has had a friend, Mr Butcher, an English gentleman who is obviously of
some
means.  From time to time he arranges at his cost for the plaintiff to meet him
either in England or elsewhere for holidays
together.  He came to Australia for
about a year to be near the plaintiff.  It seems that the relationship is one
of close friends.
 There is no suggestion of marriage between the plaintiff and
Mr Butcher.  He apparently has family, including parents, in England
and she
has her family of some eight children who are in Australia.
<P>

20  	      The plaintiff has received assistance from her children
with accommodation.  She is presently living with one child and
moves around
the various children from time to time.  She also receives assistance from the
children when she is short of funds.
<P>

21  	      It is to be remembered that the plaintiff and her husband,
during the times when they were wealthy, contributed to the
welfare of the
deceased and spent monies to provide for nursing home accommodation, with from
time to time gifts of furniture, television
and matters of that nature.
<P>

22  	      There was some suggestion that Mr Young advanced monies to
the plaintiff's husband but, given the imprecision of the
evidence, I do not
think this fact is a matter that is  appropriate to take into account.
<P>

23  	      The plaintiff herself, as I mentioned, is advancing in
years.  She does have some artery disease and high blood pressure.
I will come
back to her needs in due course.
<P>

24  	     It is also necessary to have regard to the situation of
others who have a claim on the bounty of the deceased.  Those
are the other
beneficiaries in this case.  There are some other people who are possible
eligible persons but they have been given
notice and do not make any claim.
<P>

25  	     There is Joanne Key who is a niece of the deceased.  She is
married, aged 47, with two children aged 16 and 10.  She and
her husband have a
home worth $470,000 which is subject to a mortgage of $220,000.  She has a
$6,000 car, some furniture and effects
and debts of some $5,000.  Her husband
who has a position at Volvo earns $36,750 per annum.  Joanne herself has income
from child
care which in 1998 was $6,567. She also has a regular income as a
home carer of about $150 a fortnight.
<P>

26  	     So far as her relationship with the deceased is concerned
it is important to note that even though she was a niece, she
was raised as a
daughter from a very young age, probably as young as two or three years.  She
was part of the family until she left
home to marry in 1976.  Subsequently she
maintained a very close relationship with the deceased. As the deceased got
older, it was
Joanne who looked after her and frequently visited her, drove her
to appointments and the like.
<P>

27  	     It is also important in the case of Joanne to note her
contribution to the estate.  When Joanne was very young an account
was opened
by Mr Young and instead of her receiving presents, whether they be from her
effective parents or from other members of
the family, she was given the money
and the money was put into that account.  She was shown the savings book on
birthdays and Christmas
so that she could see how much was there and her
recollection of the amount in the account was probably in the order of $4,500.
The
book itself cannot be located.
<P>

28  	     Apparently in 1966 Mr Young told Joanne that he had used
the money in that account towards the purchase of the home at
Newport which was
purchased for $15,000.  He said however that in order to make up for having
done that, he had left Joanne half
of the home.  That was a contribution of a
substantial nature to the house which was the property of the deceased and Mr
Young.
<P>

29  	     The other thing to note is something I have referred to and
that is when the last will of the deceased was prepared it
was in fact Joanne
who suggested to the deceased and Mr Young that because of the plaintiff's
situation, half of her share should
be given to the plaintiff.
<P>

30  	     I turn to the situation of Valerie.  She is married, she
is aged 67 and apparently has no dependent children.  With her
husband she has
a property in the country in which they live and which they had assessed
recently as having a value of $675,000.
 In November 1999 they gave a statement
of financial position to the ANZ Bank, no doubt due to other arrangements with
that bank.
 Their total assets were listed as $1,060,000 and debts were shown
as $197,639.  They had an overdraft facility with the bank.  Their
net assets
were $862,000 361.
<P>

31  	     Valerie's income situation is not secure, notwithstanding
the large asset base.  She works in her husband's business which
is involved in
marketing in South-east Asia.  That business has suffered a decline because of
the downturn in the Asian economy.
 Last year she received $20,125 from the
business.
<P>

32  	     So far as her relationship with the deceased is concerned,
it is important to note that she is different from the other
beneficiaries in
that she is not part of the family unit which comprised the deceased and Mr
Keith Young.  This is not because of
her design but due to circumstances which
surrounded the break up of her parents' marriage and the actual situation of
the accommodation
that was available. She was brought up initially by her
grandparents.
<P>

33  	     It is further important because although there was a
closeness in the sense of visiting once a month, there was not a
family bond
with the deceased.  After the death of Mr Young, Valerie would keep in contact
with the deceased by phone.  However,
she did not see the deceased prior to her
death.  She does not seem to have had as close contact with the deceased as the
other beneficiaries
have had and this, given the situation, is not
surprising.
<P>

34  	     Ronald Young is married.  He is 65 years of age and is a
retired teacher.  He has no dependents. He and his wife own between
them a
house worth $320,000.  He has a car worth $11,500 and shares worth $30,000.  He
has a half share of a bank account and his
share is in the order of $31,000.
His wife has some assets of her own, an investment property worth $160,000 and
shares worth $180,000.
 His income is $31,092 per annum.  He has not made any
contributions to the estate of the deceased, like Joanne has.
<P>

35  	     As far as his relationship with the deceased is concerned I
am happy to accept his evidence that he lived there between
1949 and 1951 and
also he returned to the family unit between 1954 and 1956.  After 1956 he was
posted as a teacher to Queanbeyan.
 Clearly in the time he lived there he was
treated as a son by the deceased and she had a lot to do with his upbringing
or, as he
described it in the evidence, "his civilisation".  Even when he was
away in the country Ronald would come back to Sydney several
times a year and
would see the deceased and his father on those occasions.  After his return to
Sydney in 1962 he still kept in touch
with the deceased and Mr Young.  He also
has not contributed to the estate.
<P>

36  	     It is necessary to see how the plaintiff says that she has
been left without adequate and proper provision for maintenance
and education
and advancement in life.  It is only if this occurs that the Court can
interfere with the provisions of the will. 
It is not a matter of the Court
making what might seem to be a more fair and just will.
<P>

37  	     The plaintiff says she needs a home to live in.  All the
other beneficiaries have homes and she is in a situation, in
advancing years,
when she depends upon her children for accommodation.  She naturally does not
want to impose upon them although
she has been able to cope with this situation
for a while.  She has investigated the cost of units at Bayview Gardens, the
retirement
village.  Two bedroom units are $240,000 and one bedroom units
$160,000.  Perhaps that is not really what she wishes to do at this
stage
because she has also been looking at the cost of a mobile home at the Lakeside
Caravan Park at Narrabeen.  One of those would
cost $130,000 and would give her
a place with a bedroom and bathroom and appropriate facilities.
<P>

38  	     The question arises as to whether it is appropriate that
she should be provided with sufficient funds so that she can
have a home.
These matters are to be judged by what the community expects of a testatrix
when she fulfills her duty to those who
are dependent upon her.
<P>

39  	     In Shearer v The Public Trustee, a decision of Young J on
23 March 1998, his Honour had these comments to say in talking
about the
community expectations:
<P>

"Where the applicant is... However that is not the case with children and as
far as I am aware it has never been said by any Court
that it is an obligation
that the community expects that a mother will leave her child in a position
where the child has a house
of his or her own."
<P>

40  	      Fortunately for the plaintiff, two of her children have
said that they will be able to provide $30,000 each to assist
her to obtain
some accommodation.  It is not to be forgotten that under the present
distribution of the estate she will get at least
$48,000.
<P>

41  	     In my view some modest extra legacy would be appropriate to
assist her.  The question which arises is where the burden
of any extra
provision should fall.  Certainly, as I can see, looking at the contributions
of the various beneficiaries to the deceased,
it is the case that the burden
should not fall upon the share passing to Joanne Key.  She has contributed to
the estate and was a
great support and help to the deceased during the
deceased's lifetime.
<P>

42  	     Generally I think the burden should be shared between the
shares passing to Ronald and Valerie.  There is a difference
in the family
relationships, to which I have referred earlier, and this to my mind makes it
appropriate that Valerie's share should
suffer the greater burden.
<P>

43  	     Accordingly the orders I make are as follows:
<P>

1.  The plaintiff, in addition to her interest under the will of the deceased,
to receive a legacy of $40,000.
<P>

2.  Two-thirds of the legacy as to $30,000 to be borne by the share passing to
Valerie Judith Barrow and $10,000 by the share passing
to Ronald Keith
Young.
<P>

44  	     The plaintiff's costs to be paid on a party and party basis
and the defendant's on an indemnity basis out of the estate
of the deceased.
<P>

45  	     I order the exhibits may be returned.
