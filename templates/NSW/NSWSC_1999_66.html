MASTER MALPASS
<P>

16 February 1999
<P>

<u>21017/96   -   Delaney v Birchgrove Community Association Limited</u>
<P>

<u>JUDGMENT - On Admissibility of Statements</u>
<P>

1	The plaintiff has sought to tender three Statements.  Each of the Statements
has been made to the police by a parent in attendance
at the school camp in
1991.  The defendant objects to the tender.
<P>

2	The question in issue is whether or not the Statements are admissible by
reason of provisions contained in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act, 1995</a> </i>(the
<i>Act</i>).  In the course of argument, reference has been made to provisions
contained in Part 36 of the Supreme Court Rules and sections
64, 67 and 68 of
the <i>Act</i>.
<P>

3	The only evidentiary material placed before the Court by the parties on this
question is to be found in Exhibits C and 1.  Each
party was given the
opportunity to consider their position and to tender any further evidence
thought to be necessary to support
their respective cases.  Both parties took
the stance that no further evidence was required.
<P>

4	Exhibit C is a letter dated 21 October 1998 from the plaintiff's solicitors
to the insurer for the defendant.  The material parts
of the letter are as
follows:-
<P>

	"We give you notice pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 67</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> that we propose
to tender at the hearing the <b>enclosed</b>:
<P>

	1.	Police statement of Jennifer Lee Hensby of 19 March 1991.
<P>

	2.	Police statement of Nola Elizabeth Payton dated 19 March 1991.
<P>

	3.	Police statement of Michael Charles Hawke of 19 March 1991.
<P>

	4.	Police statement of Emma Rasmussen dated 19 March 1991.
<P>

	We will rely upon <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 64(2)(b)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> because it would cause
undue expense, undue delay and would not be reasonably practical to call the
makers of these statements as
the makers of the statements cannot be
located."
<P>

5	Exhibit 1 is a letter dated 8 February 1999 from the solicitor for the
defendant to the solicitors for the plaintiff.  The material
parts are in the
following terms:-
<P>

	"I refer to your letter of 21 October 1998 purporting to give notice pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 67</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> in relation to Jennifer Hensby, Nola Payton
and Michael Hawke.
<P>

	As I understand it, you are now well aware of the fact that each of these
three people is available and able to be called to give
evidence.
<P>

	In the circumstances, I will oppose any attempt by you to rely on the
provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> you refer to."
<P>

6	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 64</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">67</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">68</a> are comprised in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p3.2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3.2</a> (Hearsay) of Chapter 3
(Admissibility of Evidence).  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s59.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 59</a> legislates what is known as "the
hearsay rule".  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 60</a>-<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">66</a> make provision for exceptions to that rule.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 64</a> is headed "Exception: civil proceedings if maker available".
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 67</a> imposes notice requirements relevant to, inter alia, the provisions
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 64(2).</a>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 67</a> is headed "Notice to be given".  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 68</a>
contains provisions relating to the making of objections to tender of hearsay
evidence.  It is headed "Objections to tender of hearsay
evidence in civil
proceedings if maker available".
<P>

7	For present purposes, emphasis has been placed on the following statutory
provisions:-
<P>

	<b> 64</b>  (1) This section applies in a civil proceeding if a person who
made a previous representation is available to give evidence about
an asserted
fact.
<P>

	   (2) The hearsay rule does not apply to:
<P>

	(a)	oral evidence of the representation that is given by a person who saw,
heard or otherwise perceived the representation being
made, or
<P>

	(b)	a document so far as it contains the representation, or another
representation to which it is reasonably necessary to refer
in order to
understand the representation,
<P>

	if it would cause undue expense or undue delay, or would not be reasonably
practicable, to call the person who made the representation
to give
evidence.
<P>

	<b> 67</b>  (1) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 63(2)</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">64</a>(2) and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">65</a>(2), (3) and (8) do not apply to
evidence adduced by a party unless that party has given reasonable notice in
writing to each other
party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence.
<P>

	  (2) Notices given under subsection (1) are to be given in accordance with
any regulations or rules of court made for the purposes
of this section.
<P>

	  (3) The notice must state:
<P>

	(a)	the particular provisions of this Division on which the party intends to
rely in arguing that the hearsay rule does not apply
to the evidence, and
<P>

	(b)	if <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 64(2)</a> is such a provision - the grounds, specified in that
provision, on which the party intends to rely.
<P>

	<b> 68</b>  (1) In a civil proceeding, if the notice discloses that it is not
intended to call the person who made the previous representation
concerned
because it:
<P>

	(a)	would cause undue expense or undue delay, or
<P>

	(b)	would not be reasonably practicable,
<P>

	a party may, not later than 21 days after notice has been given, object to the
tender of the evidence, or of a specified part of
the evidence.
<P>

	  (2) The objection is to be made by giving to each other party a written
notice setting out the grounds on which the objection
is made.
<P>

	  (3) The court may, on the application of a party, determine the objection at
or before the hearing.
<P>

	  (4) If the objection is unreasonable, the court may order that, in any
event, the party objecting is to bear the costs incurred
by another party:
<P>

	(a)	in relation to the objection, and
<P>

	(b)	in calling the person who made the representation to give evidence.
<P>

8	The plaintiff seeks to rely on the exclusion provisions contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
64.</a>  She claims to have given notice pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 67</a> and asserts that no
objection has been made by the defendant in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 68.</a>
<P>

9	The defendant raises a number of matters.  I shall mention some of them.  It
raises evidentiary problems in relation to the applicability
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 64.</a>  It
says that the purported notice given by the plaintiff is not valid.  Further,
it says that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 68</a> does not preclude the making of an objection outside
the 21 day period.  In any event, it says that the Court has a discretion to
reject the tender.
<P>

10	Counsel have not been able to refer me to any authority directly bearing
upon the matters in issue.  I therefore approach this
problem without the
assistance of authority.
<P>

11	It does seem to me that the plaintiff's tender is founded on misconception.
There seems to have been a misunderstanding of the
relevant statutory
provisions.
<P>

12	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 64</a> has application where the maker of the representation is
available to give evidence about the asserted fact.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 64(2)</a> provides
that the hearsay rule does not apply to a document containing the
representation if it would cause undue expense or undue
delay or would not be
reasonably practicable to call the person who made the representation to give
evidence.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 67</a> is a notice provision applicable to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 63(2)</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">64</a>(2)
and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">65</a>(2), (3) and (8).  It provides that, inter alia, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 64(2)</a> does not
apply to the subject evidence unless notice has been given which satisfies the
requirements of that section.  Subject to
the operation of subsection (4), the
giving of such notice is a step that must be taken by a party seeking to take
advantage of these
exceptions to the hearsay rule.  The provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
68</a> are also directed to cases where the maker is available.  It enables the
making of an objection to the tender of the evidence.  Any
objection so made
may be determined by the Court either at or before the hearing.
<P>

13	Such evidence as there is does not attract the application of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 64(2).</a>
This is a provision which provides an exception to the hearsay rule in cases
where the maker is available but the calling of him
to give evidence would
cause undue expense or undue delay or would not be reasonably practicable.  It
is part of a statutory scheme
which, if implemented by a party, may lead to the
situation where that party can tender evidence of the representation without
calling
the maker of it.
<P>

14	I am not satisfied that any of the makers of the representations are
available to give evidence.  On this vital matter, the Court
is merely left
with competing assertions.  Indeed, the only material placed before the Court
by the plaintiff contains the assertion
that each of the makers of the
Statements cannot be located (the assertion can only give support to a finding
that the maker is not
available).  Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the
plaintiff can rely on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s64.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 64.</a>  Once this position is reached, it is
unnecessary to proceed further with the other matters that were agitated by
Counsel.  However,
it may be of assistance to add some further comment.
<P>

15	Rule 13D of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p36" class="autolink_findacts">Part 36</a> imposes time limitations for the giving of notice under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s67.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 67.</a>  Some reliance was placed on this rule, but the matter was not
fully argued.  The notice that was given suffers from the misconception
and
would not satisfy the statutory requirements in a case where the maker was
unavailable (see subsection (3)).  A person is taken
not to be available to
give evidence in the situations identified in clause 4 of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">Part 2</a> of the
Dictionary.  In the present circumstances, the failure to make an objection
within the prescribed 21 days is of no relevance.
 The determination of an
objection may see the ventilation of, inter alia, matters such as whether the
calling of the maker would
cause undue expense or delay or would not be
reasonably practicable.
<P>

16	I reject the tender of each of the Statements.
