BANKING GROUP LIMITED</u></b>
<P>

<P>

<b>Reasons for judgment</b>
<P>

1	By the statement of claim in these proceedings the plaintiff, Lloyd Foyster
sues the defendant, ANZ Banking Group Ltd for financial
loss said to have
resulted from a foreign currency loan.  Before me are motions by each of the
parties.  The defendant seeks an order
that the proceedings be summarily
dismissed or permanently stayed.  The plaintiff seeks leave to file an amended
statement of claim,
adding another party as plaintiff and claiming further
relief.  To understand the issues which I must decide it is necessary to
examine
the protracted history of this litigation.
<P>

2	In 1985 the plaintiff was the major shareholder in a company known as Country
Properties Pty Ltd, and was its managing director.
 For the purpose of a large
development project, the company obtained a substantial loan from the defendant
in Swiss francs.  It
is the plaintiff's case that the manager of the defendant
with whom he was dealing advised him to take the advance in that currency.
 The
plaintiff also provided a personal guarantee in respect of the loan.
Subsequently, as a result of variation in exchange rates,
the company's
indebtedness to the defendant in Australian dollars increased markedly, so that
its viability was threatened.
<P>

3	In 1990 the company commenced proceedings against the defendant in the
Commercial Division of this Court, seeking damages for
what was said to be
negligent advice by the defendant about the loan.  Those proceedings were
transferred to the Common Law Division
(11620/91), but on 14 April 1993 they
were dismissed pursuant to Pt 24 r9 of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Rules</a></i> because
of the company's failure to provide a verified statement in answer to
interrogatories.
<P>

4	On 6 May 1991 the defendant had a receiver and manager appointed to the
company, and on 17 June 1991 the plaintiff resigned as
a director.  On the
following day he commenced proceedings himself against the defendant
(13286/91).  In that statement of claim
he alleged that his financial interest
was co-extensive with that of the company, and he sought damages for negligence
and a declaration
that his personal guarantee was void and should be set aside.
The statement of claim was filed on the day before the limitation period
expired and was served two years later, on the last day permitted by the Rules.

<P>

5	I should record that in 1991 the plaintiff also issued a statement of claim
in the District Court against the defendant and the
manger to whom I have
referred.  In September 1997 those proceedings were dismissed pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/scr1970232/index.html#p11a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt
11A</a>, r3(1) of the <i>District Court Rules</i>, and nothing more need be said
about them.
<P>

6	On 19 December 1991 the plaintiff entered into a deed of assignment under Pt
X of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act </i>1966</a>.  On 26 October 1992 the trustee issued a
certificate, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s232.html" class="autolink_findacts">s232</a> of the Act, that the plaintiff's divisible
property had been realised and a final dividend had been paid to creditors.
The effect
of that deed and that certificate upon the various causes of action
which the plaintiff might have against the defendant is a matter
to which I
shall turn in due course. 
<P>

7	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a> </i>provides that any action commenced
by a person who later becomes bankrupt is stayed until the trustee elects to
prosecute or discontinue
the action.  By <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s231.html" class="autolink_findacts">s231(2)</a> that provision also applies to
a person who has executed a deed of assignment under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Pt X.</a>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60(3)</a>
enables the defendant to such an action to serve a "notice of the action" upon
the trustee and, unless the trustee makes an election
under subs(2) within 28
days thereafter, he or she is deemed to have abandoned the action.  On 2 July
1993 the present defendant
served such a notice upon the trustee in respect of
the outstanding proceedings in this Court.  There was correspondence between
the trustee and the defendant's solicitors, but it is sufficient to say that no
election was made within the prescribed period.
<P>

8	In the meantime, on 6 July 1993 the plaintiff offered to purchase from the
trustee certain proprietary interests, including the
action which he had
commenced in this Court.  On the same day or the following day, that offer was
accepted.  It was within the trustee's
power to do so by virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s219.html" class="autolink_findacts">s219</a> of the
Act, and it is clear that there was an effective assignment of the action back
to the plaintiff.
<P>

9	In August 1993 the defendant filed a motion seeking that that action be
summarily dismissed or permanently stayed.  In the following
month the
plaintiff filed a motion seeking leave to file an amended statement of claim.
The amendments included the assertion of
a further cause of action based on
fraud.
<P>

10	These motions were heard by Master Malpass, who gave judgment on 26 April
1994.  The Master dismissed the plaintiff's motion
and struck out the statement
of claim.  He dealt with a number of matters which had been argued but, for
present purposes, it is
sufficient to say that he held that the effect of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s60(3)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a> </i>was that the action was deemed to have been
abandoned, and that abandonment was unaffected by the assignment of the action
to the
plaintiff.  An appeal against that decision was dismissed by Simpson J
in a judgment of 14 May 1997.
<P>

11	In October 1995, after the appeal had been argued but before Simpson J had
delivered her judgment, the plaintiff filed the statement
of claim in the
proceedings with which I am dealing (21004/95).   It also sought damages for
negligence and, in addition, alleged
fraud in terms similar to the cause of
action which the plaintiff had sought to incorporate by amendment into the 1991
proceedings.
 However, that statement of claim was not served until October
1997, after Simpson J had dismissed the appeal.  It also was served
on the last
day permitted by the Rules.  The plaintiff did not appeal against Simpson J's
decision, and in evidence before me he
said that, if judgment had then been
given allowing the appeal, he would have pursued the 1991 proceedings and would
not have served
the 1995 statement of claim.
<P>

12	The story does not end there.  On 1 November 1996 the plaintiff filed yet
another statement of claim (21219/96).  At that time,
of course, Simpson J had
not delivered her judgment and the 1995 statement of claim had not been served.
This document was drawn
by the plaintiff himself, without legal assistance.  It
covered the same territory as the previous statements of claim but also made
some further related allegations, which are not presently material.  In
evidence before me, the plaintiff said that he was seeking
to protect himself
by this document, as he "had a gut feeling that all these things should have
been under the one heading, under
the one banner, heard at the one time..."

<P>

13	Yet again, the defendant sought to have this statement of claim summarily
dismissed or permanently stayed.  It was dismissed
by Master Harrison in a
judgment of 8 December 1997.  The Master arrived at her decision after an
examination of each of the claims
in the document.  For present purposes, all
that need be said is that she determined that the claim in negligence should be
struck
out as an abuse of process as it was identical to the claim in the 1995
proceedings: see  <i>Maple v David Syme &amp; Co </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%201%20NSWLR%20290" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) 1 NSWLR 290.</a>  The
plaintiff did not appeal against Master Harrison's decision.  It was while that
judgment was reserved that he served the 1995
statement of claim, with which I
am dealing.
<P>

	<b>The present motions</b>
<P>

14	The claim for negligence in the 1995 statement of claim is identical to, or
to the same effect as, those to be found in the statements
of claim issued by
the plaintiff in 1991 and 1996, as well as in the proceedings commenced by the
company in 1990.  The claim for
fraud is very serious.  The allegation is that
the defendant, through its manager, induced the plaintiff and the company to
enter
into the loan transaction by false representations, made deliberately or
recklessly, and by failing to provide relevant information
within its
knowledge.  It is asserted that the manager was having an affair with the
plaintiff's former wife and had resolved to
cause him financial harm. 
<P>

15	The proposed amended statement of claim adds the company as a second
plaintiff, the plaintiff having been re-appointed as a director
in September
1993.  The various claims are expressed to accommodate that fact but, allowing
for differences in draftsmanship, the
claim for negligence is maintained.  So
is the claim in fraud, although all that is alleged is the reckless making of
false representations.
<P>

16	What is significant is the addition of a number of further claims.  As to
the loan transaction, reliance is also placed, in the
alternative, on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52</a> (and
s51A) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</i> 1974</a> (Cth) and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s42.html" class="autolink_findacts">s42</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair
Trading Act</i> 1987</a> (NSW).  In addition, there are claims in negligence and in
fraud arising from what is said to be the defendant's inflated valuation
of a
property owned by the company, upon the basis of which a further loan was made
in early October 1989 for the purpose of the
development.  From those funds, it
is said, the debt arising from the foreign currency loan was discharged.
Allied to this is an
allegation that members of the plaintiff's family, relying
upon the valuation, offered to purchase shares in the company but that
offer
was unreasonably refused by the defendant.  That refusal is said to amount to
unconscionable conduct within the meaning of
s51AA of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices
Act</a></i>.  
<P>

17	Finally, there is a claim arising from the sale in 1994 by the defendant, as
mortgagee, of a property of the company at what
is said to have been an
undervalue.  This claim stands apart from the others because, as will be seen,
it is unaffected by the principal
arguments with which I must deal.  I shall
return to it in due course.
<P>

18	The primary submission of counsel for the defendant was that all the other
claims by the plaintiff personally were assigned to
the trustee when he entered
into the deed of assignment under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Pt X</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a> </i>in December
1991, and it is this which determines their fate. (It is not clear when the
conduct said to have been unconscionable within
the meaning of s51AA of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> </i>occurred, but I proceed upon the assumption that it
was before the assignment.  The contrary was not suggested in argument.)  The
various causes of action, arising before December 1991, were part of the
plaintiff's "divisible property", within the meaning of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s187.html" class="autolink_findacts">s187(1)</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a></i>, and they were vested in the trustee upon execution of
the assignment.  I do not understand counsel for the plaintiff to have
submitted
to the contrary.  It is at the next stage of the defendant's argument
that the parties are at odds.
<P>

19	Counsel for the defendant submitted that, subject to the reassignment to him
in July 1993 of the 1991 action, none of these causes
of action has since
revested in the plaintiff.  It was argued that the certificate of "release"
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s232.html" class="autolink_findacts">s232</a> of the Act, issued in October 1992, did not have that effect.
Reliance was placed upon the decision of Needham J in <i>Pegler v Dale
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%201%20NSWLR%20265" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 1 NSWLR 265</a> and of the Court of Appeal in <i>Daemar v Industrial
Commission of New South Wales [No 2]</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2022%20NSWLR%20178" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 22 NSWLR 178.</a>  
<P>

20	In <i>Pegler</i> Needham J held that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s153.html" class="autolink_findacts">s153(1)</a> of the Act, which relieves a
bankrupt from debts provable in the bankruptcy upon his or her discharge, does
not have the effect of
revesting in the bankrupt property which was vested in
the trustee by the sequestration order.  In arriving at that conclusion, his
Honour had regard to the duty of a discharged bankrupt, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">s152</a>, to
"give such assistance as the trustee reasonably requires in the realisation and
distribution of such of his or her property as
is vested in the trustee".  
<P>

21	In <i>Daemar</i> the Court of Appeal adopted the view of Needham J.  Kirby
P, with whom Clarke and Meagher JJA agreed, referred to his Honour's analysis
of the effect of the discharge of a bankrupt in the light of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">s152</a>, which
assumes that property vested in the trustee by the sequestration order remains
so vested even after discharge.  However, it
seems that the President's view
was not wholly dependant upon <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">s152.</a>  After noting that the property which
remains vested in the trustee upon discharge includes choses in action, his
Honour continued
(at 185): 
<P>

	Not only is Needham J's construction attentive of the language of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">s152.</a>  It is
appropriate to the scheme of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a></i>.  Under that Act, it is
the function of the trustee to gather for the benefit of the creditors the
property of the bankrupt at the
time of the sequestration.  Save for the
exceptions provided by the Act, such property is to be then available for
distribution to
the creditors.  The property includes choses in action.  It
thus includes the "actions" which a bankrupt may have commenced at the
time of
the sequestration order. 
<P>

22	In <i>Daemar</i> the question was whether a discharged bankrupt was entitled
to pursue proceedings which had been the subject of a deemed abandonment
by the
trustee, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s60(3)</a> of the Act, during his bankruptcy.  Kirby P
referred to some judicial pronouncements to the effect that an action which is
stayed
or abandoned during bankruptcy may be able to be prosecuted by the
bankrupt upon his or her discharge: see the judgment of Rogerson
J in <i>Re
Kwok; Ex parte Rummel</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%2061%20FLR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 61 FLR 336</a> at 341-3, and the cases there
referred to.  However, the President preferred the reasoning of Needham J in<i>
Pegler</i> to the observations of Rogerson J in <i>Re Kwok</i>.  The matter was
determined not by the effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s60</a>, but by the fact that property does not
revest in a bankrupt upon his or her discharge.  Speaking of the proceedings
which Mr Daemar
wished to prosecute, his Honour said (also at 185), "In short,
it is not the claimant's action to pursue."
<P>

23	Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that <i>Daemar</i> could be
distinguished because it was concerned with the effect of a sequestration
order, rather than a deed of assignment under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Pt X</a> of the Act.  She argued that
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Pt X</a> sets up its own regime, and shares the incidents of bankruptcy only in so
far as other provisions of the Act are incorporated by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s231.html" class="autolink_findacts">s231.</a>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 152</a> is
not one of those provisions and it applies only to a discharged bankrupt:
<i>Official Receiver v Todd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2014%20FCR%20177" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 14 FCR 177</a>, per Lockhart J at 185.  That
being so, it was said, the present case is governed by the reasoning of
Rogerson J in <i>Re Kwok</i>.
<P>

24	This submission is inconsistent with a concession made on behalf of the
plaintiff (when he was differently represented) in the
proceedings before
Master Malpass.  At pp3-4 of his judgment, the Master recorded that it was
"common ground" that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Pt X</a> deed assigned to the trustee all causes of action
which the plaintiff had against the defendant, and that the certificate under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s232.html" class="autolink_findacts">s232</a> "did not disturb the trustee's title to the choses in action vested in
him."  
<P>

25	In any event, I do not consider that the reasoning of Kirby P in <i>Daemar
</i>is inapplicable to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Pt X</a> arrangements.  As I have said, the passage from his
Honour's judgment quoted above demonstrates that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s152.html" class="autolink_findacts">s152</a> was relevant to his
conclusion, but not determinative of it.  The policy considerations arising
from the scheme of the Act, referred
to by his Honour, apply with equal force
to a deed of assignment which, by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s178.html" class="autolink_findacts">s178(1)</a>, is defined as "a deed by which a
debtor assigns all his divisible property for the benefit of his creditors."
Accordingly, I am
satisfied that a certificate under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s232.html" class="autolink_findacts">s232</a> does not have the
effect of revesting in the debtor his or her property, including choses in
action.  
<P>

26	What, then, is the effect of the assignment back to the plaintiff in July
1993 of various interests in property, including the
"action filed in the
Supreme Court of NSW Sydney Registry Common Law Division No 13286 of 1991..."?
Counsel for the defendant submitted
that the assignment was of that action
only, and it had been given its quietus by the decisions of Master Malpass and
Simpson J.
 However, the plaintiff relied upon what was described as a deed of
confirmation made between him and the trustee in November 1993.
 The effect of
that deed is an assertion that the assignment of July 1993 was always intended
to embrace any cause of action arising
from the plaintiff's dealings with the
defendant from 1995 to the date of the certificate of release, 26 October
1992.
<P>

27	The plaintiff sought to rely upon this deed before Master Malpass, although
not until after the hearing had concluded.  The Master
refused an application
to re-open for that purpose, as he considered that the deed was not admissible
for the purpose of construction
of the agreement of July 1993.  The effect of
that agreement, the Master found, was "an assignment of the subject matter of
the proceedings
that were then on foot", not "an assignment of all the causes
of action whatsoever that the plaintiff might have against the defendant"
(p12
of the judgment).  I agree.
<P>

28	However, in a sense, the matter may be academic.  In written submissions
furnished after the hearing before me, counsel for the
plaintiff foreshadowed
an application for leave to call evidence from the trustee that he would be
prepared to revest in the plaintiff
the rights of action which he now wishes to
pursue: cf <i>Daemar </i>at 182.  Subject to hearing counsel for the defendant,
I would be minded to grant that leave if I were unpersuaded by the defendant's
other arguments in the matter generally.  To those I now turn.
<P>

29	Counsel for the defendant advanced a number of other reasons why the
existing statement of claim should be dismissed and the
amendments disallowed.
He referred to the sorry history of the litigation, which over the years has
maintained little more than a
bare existence and on several occasions was
resuscitated only minutes before its terminal gasp. He submitted that the
existing statement
of claim is an abuse of process as it reproduces claims
which had previously been struck out or dismissed, or had been the subject
of a
previous unsuccessful application to amend.  The same argument is available in
relation to the proposed amended statement of
claim in so far as it maintains
the causes of action in the existing statement of claim.  Further, counsel
argued that the pursuit
of the existing statement of claim is merely an attempt
to avoid the consequences of the decisions of Master Malpass and Simpson
J, and
the appropriate course would have been to appeal from Simpson J's decision.
<P>

30	Counsel for the defendant also submitted that a number of the claims, both
existing and proposed, are statute barred.  The claim
in negligence arising
from the foreign currency loan is well outside the six year period prescribed
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">s14(1)(b)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act </i>1969</a>.  Similarly, the alternative
claims under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> </i>and the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a>
</i>are outside the three year period set by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s82.html" class="autolink_findacts">s82(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices
Act</a> </i>and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s68.html" class="autolink_findacts">s68(2)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a></i>, even if they relate back to
the date of filing of the existing statement of claim.  It is true, as counsel
for the plaintiff pointed
out, that a limitation period is a defence which
should be pleaded and would normally be a matter to be determined at the trial.
Nevertheless, it is clear that the defendant would rely on the limitation
periods here and counsel for the plaintiff did not suggest
any basis upon which
they might be resisted.
<P>

31	In <i>Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 514</a>, the
High Court cautioned against deciding limitation questions of the kind which it
was considering at an interlocutory stage "except
in the clearest of cases":
see the joint judgment at 533.  In that case the question whether a limitation
period applied turned on
when, as a matter of law, the cause of action accrued.
In the present case, the applicability of the limitation periods relied upon
does not appear to depend upon the resolution of any disputed question of fact
or law.  This is a clear case.
<P>

32	Accordingly, the existing claim for negligence should be struck out.  The
proposed amended claim in negligence arising from the
foreign loan transaction
and the proposed claims under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s52</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> </i>and <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair
Trading Act</a> </i>should not be allowed, as it would be futile to do so.
<P>

33	As I have said, the proposed amended statement of claim includes claims for
negligence and fraud connected with the further loan
of October 1989 (see para
16 above).  If the claim in negligence were  related back to the date of filing
of the existing statement
of claim, it would be within time, albeit by a hair's
breadth.  It was clearly out of time when the plaintiff's motion for leave
to
amend was filed.  The time limitation on the claim in fraud cannot be
determined, as it would depend on the findings of fact necessitated
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55</a> of
the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></i> and there is no evidence before me about that matter.

<P>

34	Amendment after the expiry of a limitation period is dealt with by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/index.html#p20" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 20</a> r4.
Sub-rule (5) envisages that the plaintiff might have leave to add that claim in
negligence if I were satisfied that it arises
out of "the same or substantially
the same facts" as those giving rise to the existing statement of claim.
Clearly, it does not.

<P>

35	The existing claims relate entirely to the foreign loan transaction
negotiated in 1985 (see paras 11 and 14 above). It may well
be that the 1989
loan was made in the course of a continuing relationship between the parties,
was for the purpose of the same development,
and provided funds with which the
foreign currency loan was discharged.  There the connection would appear to
end.  To no extent
could any claim arising from the 1989 loan be said to arise
from the facts of the transaction four years earlier: cf <i>McGee v Yeomans</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%201%20NSWLR%20273" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977] 1 NSWLR 273</a>, especially per Mahoney JA at 284-5 and the cases there
referred to.  
<P>

36	I am mindful of the fact that, in the light of Pt20 r4(7), I retain a
discretion to allow the amendment even though the requirements
of sub-rule(5)
have not been met:<i> McGee v Yeomans</i>, per Glass JA at 279-80.  However, I
do not consider it appropriate to do so.  No explanation for the delay in
bringing proceedings
arising from the 1989 loan was proffered, and no adequate
reason for depriving the defendant of the protection of the statutory bar
was
advanced.  Accordingly, that amendment also should not be allowed.
<P>

37	The same must be said of the allied claim under s51AA of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade
Practices Act</a>.  </i>It is unclear from the amended statement of claim when that
cause of action is said to have accrued, but earlier in these reasons
(para 18)
I expressed the assumption that the alleged unconscionable conduct occurred
before the plaintiff entered into the deed
of assignment under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/index.html#p10" class="autolink_findacts">Pt X</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a> </i>in December 1991.  If that be so, that claim was statute
barred at the time of the plaintiff's motion to amend and, indeed, when the
existing statement of claim was filed.  I would be minded to disallow the
amendment but, given the High Court's admonition in <i>Wardley</i> (para 31
above), counsel should have the opportunity to be heard further on this
aspect.
<P>

38	The claims in fraud, both existing and proposed, cannot be disposed of in
this way.  The existing claim for fraud arising from
the foreign loan
transaction is maintained in the proposed amended statement of claim, although
somewhat differently expressed. 
In addition, there is the proposed claim in
fraud arising from the 1989 loan.  The question whether any of those claims is
statute
barred turns, as I have said, upon the findings required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s55.html" class="autolink_findacts">s55</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></i>.  The material which I have does not enable me to decide
that matter, even if it were desirable that I should do so.
<P>

39	As I have recounted, the claim for fraud arising from the foreign loan
transaction was first raised when it was sought to be
incorporated by amendment
into the 1991 statement of claim (paras 9 and 10 supra).  It seems that Master
Malpass would not have allowed
the amendment in any event: see p17ff of his
judgment of 26 April 1994.  However, the Master did not have to determine the
matter
in the light of his decision that the action was deemed to have been
abandoned by virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s60.html" class="autolink_findacts">s60(3)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/" class="autolink_findacts">Bankruptcy Act</a></i>.  For the same
reason, Simpson J did not consider the amendment in her judgment on the appeal
from the Master.
<P>

40	As already observed (para 29 above), counsel for the defendant submitted
that there were a number of reasons why I should exercise
my discretion to
strike out the existing claim for fraud and to disallow the proposed amendment.
Those arguments have considerable
force, but they do not persuade me that the
plaintiff should be prevented from pursuing that claim if he is in a position
to do so.
 The allegations are very grave and, apart from the disadvantage
inevitably suffered by delay, counsel for the defendant did not
suggest that
his client would not now be able to gather evidence in answer to the claim.  I
would be minded to allow the amendment
to that claim, relating back to the date
of filing of the existing statement of claim.
<P>

41	Similarly, I consider that the plaintiff should be permitted to pursue the
proposed claim for fraud arising from the 1989 loan
transaction, if he is in a
position to do so.  I would be minded to allow that amendment also.  However,
as there may be a question
whether that claim is affected by a time limitation,
I think that it would be unfair to allow that claim to relate back to the date
of filing of the existing statement of claim.  On the other hand, there has
been delay since the notice of motion for leave to amend
was filed, in the
listing of the matter for hearing and in my delivery of these reasons, for
which the plaintiff should not be held
responsible.  In my view, justice would
be done if that claim were deemed to have been brought on the day on which the
motion to
amend was filed, 13 February 1998.  I see no reason why this could
not be imposed as a term upon which the amendment is allowed.
 However, as the
matter was not raised in argument, I invite counsel's submissions upon it.
<P>

42	I have said that the plaintiff should be able to pursue both claims of fraud
if he is in a position to do so.  Of course, he
is not in that position unless
the trustee revests in him those rights of action.  As observed (para 28
above), counsel for the plaintiff
foreshadowed that she would seek leave to
call evidence from the trustee about that matter.  I shall hear submissions
from counsel
upon that aspect also.
<P>

43	The last amendment to be dealt with is the proposed addition of the company
as a second plaintiff.  As counsel for the defendant
correctly pointed out,
this is not a matter to be dealt with by amendment under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/index.html#p20" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 20</a> of the Rules.
In truth, it is an application for the addition of a party under  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/index.html#p8" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 8</a> r8.
Sub-rule (2) of that rule requires evidence that the company consents to being
added as a plaintiff.  That said, there is every
reason to join the company as
a party in accordance with sub-rule 8(1) and, given the plaintiff's controlling
interest in it, I have
no doubt that the company would consent to that course.
I would allow the plaintiff to amend his notice of motion accordingly, and
to
produce evidence of the company's consent. 
<P>

44	Having determined that the plaintiff and the company should be allowed to
pursue the claims in fraud arising from the transactions
in 1985 and 1989, I am
conscious of the seriousness of the allegations giving rise to both those
claims.  I trust that careful consideration
will be given to the evidence in
support of them before they are pressed.  
<P>

45	Finally, I should return to the claim arising from the defendant's sale of
mortgaged property in 1994 (para 17 above).  On the
face of it, there is
nothing to prevent the plaintiff and the company pursuing that claim at this
time, and I see no reason why that
should not be done by amendment of the
existing statement of claim.  Nor does it appear that any terms should be
imposed upon that
amendment but, if either party wish to be heard upon that
matter, counsel should have that opportunity.
<P>

46	It will be necessary to re-list the matter for argument upon the outstanding
issues to which I have referred.  Appropriate orders
can then be formulated
and, if necessary, I shall hear argument upon costs.
