<b>THE SUPREME COURT</b>
<P>

<b>OF NEW SOUTH WALES</b>
<P>

<b>COMMON LAW DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>NEWMAN J</b>
<P>

<b><u>WEDNESDAY, 1 DECEMBER 1999</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>NEWCASTLE:  66/97  -  JACKSON  v  ROBINSON</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  This is a claim for damages for
personal injuries arising out of a motor vehicle accident which occurred on 6
March 1996. Breach
of duty of care has been admitted by the defendant and thus
the matter is one calling for the assessment of damages pursuant to the
<b>Motor Accidents Act</b> 1988 should the plaintiff qualify.
<P>

2   	In the light of the concession that the defendant was in
breach of his duty of care it is not necessary for me to go into the
facts of
the accident in great detail. Suffice it to say that the plaintiff was driving
a motor vehicle which was stationary in a
line of traffic when the defendant's
vehicle collided with the rear of the vehicle the plaintiff was driving. In
these circumstances
the concession made is hardly surprising.
<P>

3   	Following the accident the plaintiff attended the Wallsend
Hospital Primary Care Centre where she was complaining of pain in
her low back
and neck. At the time the plaintiff was employed as an apprentice electrician
with Port Waratah Coal Service. 
<P>

4   	At the Wallsend Hospital, Dr Accardi concluded that the
plaintiff had suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and low back
and
prescribed medication and arranged for the plaintiff to have physiotherapy and
a neck brace. He certified her unfit, at that
stage, for work for one week.
<P>

5   	She underwent the prescribed physiotherapy and attended her
general practitioner, one Dr E Balaz. The plaintiff continued to
complain of
pain in her neck and low back and remained off work.
<P>

6   	By mid April the plaintiff was complaining of headaches,
pain radiating into both her arms from her neck, pins and needles
in her right
hand, interscapular pain. As far as her back was concerned she noticed that the
pain was radiating from her low back
down to the back of her right calf. She
also complained of pain radiating from her back down her left knee to knee
level. She remained
off work.
<P>

7   	On 15 May 1996 she was referred to Dr A Isaacs, orthopaedic
surgeon. The plaintiff's complaints were similar to those she had
been making
to Dr Balaz. Dr Isaacs noted also tenderness over the mid cervical and upper
thoracic spine together with tenderness
over associated muscles. He also noted
tenderness over the L4/5 and L5/S1 area in her low back mainly over the right
sacroiliac joint.
Sciatic stretch testing proved positive.
<P>

8   	Following that episode she underwent a bone scan at Dr
Isaacs' direction which in Dr Isaacs' view disclosed mild to moderate
bilateral
sacroiliitis.
<P>

9   	Her symptoms persisted. A concern that the plaintiff's
problems stemmed from rheumatic causes was dispelled following an examination
by a Dr S Ratnarajah.
<P>

10   	She continued with physiotherapy including hydrotherapy.
She came, in September 1996, under the care of the Hunter Rehabilitation
Service. However, her symptoms persisted and she complained that the
hydrotherapy was causing her severe pain.
<P>

11   	The plaintiff complained, as the year went on, of
suffering from spasms in her right leg and bad pain in her neck, low back
and
between her shoulder blades and down one of her arms together with
headaches.
<P>

12   	On 5 December 1996 the plaintiff awoke with severe pain in
her left lower back which was radiating down her left leg. She
was taken to
Maitland Hospital casualty but was not admitted as an in-patient. The
plaintiff's symptoms persisted.
<P>

13   	In September 1996 Dr Isaacs had advised that the plaintiff
should undergo a caudal block injection for diagnostic purposes.
That procedure
was carried out on 7 January 1997. She obtained temporary relief of her
buttocks and leg pain but by mid January the
pain had returned.
<P>

14   	In February, at Dr Isaacs direction, she underwent a CAT
scan of her lumbar spine. In the view of the radiologist and Dr Isaacs
the CAT
scan disclosed a disc herniation at the posterior aspect of the L5/S1 level
encroaching upon the first sacral nerve root.
<P>

15   	This led Dr Isaacs to conclude that the plaintiff should
undergo surgery to her low back. She was then sent to Dr Ghabrial
another
orthopaedic surgeon. He agreed with Dr Isaacs' diagnosis being of the view that
the plaintiff had suffered a disc prolapse
at L5/S1 in the accident. He agreed
that surgery was required.
<P>

16   	In May 1997 she was sent to Dr Hopcroft, orthopaedic
surgeon, by her solicitors. He agreed with the view expressed by Drs
Isaacs and
Ghabrial that the plaintiff had suffered a L5/S1 disc injury. He felt that
before surgery was undertaken the plaintiff
should continue with a conservative
regime including physiotherapy and hydrotherapy.
<P>

17   	The plaintiff, I should observe, at this stage, married on
1 March 1997. She was reluctant to undergo surgery.
<P>

18   	In August 1997 her concerns about her condition led her to
consult a psychiatrist, Dr L Lambeth, who diagnosed that the plaintiff
was
suffering, at that time, from mild depression consequent upon her injuries.
That doctor felt that the plaintiff required pain
management.
<P>

19   	She remained off work and continued to consult Dr Balaz'
practice. She occasionally saw Dr Nymeyer, Dr Balaz' partner.
<P>

20   	Eventually, she was sent to see a neurologist, Dr Parsons.
A CAT scan of her neck in October 1997 revealed no abnormality.
<P>

21   	Her symptoms persisted and she continued to see her
general practitioner. She saw Dr Hopcroft again in December 1997 who,
while
finding it difficult to explain why it was she complained of right-sided
sciatica when the CAT scan revealed left-sided protrusion
of her L5/S1 disc.
However, he was not convinced that the plaintiff should undergo surgery.
<P>

22   	Eventually, the plaintiff, on 15 January 1998 underwent
further MRI scans of both her lumbar and cervical spines. Again, that
scan was
thought, by the radiologist and by Dr Isaacs, to reveal a disc protrusion at
the L5/S1 level with consequent narrowing of
the disc space at that level.
<P>

23   	Again, both Dr Isaacs and the radiologist agreed that the
MRI scan disclosed disc bulging at the C4/5 and C5/6 levels. Dr
Isaacs was of
the view that at the C5/6 level the plaintiff had suffered a possible minor
annular tear.
<P>

24   	She saw Dr Hopcroft in March 1998. As I understand his
report, his views as to the plaintiff's injuries coincided with those
of Dr
Isaacs.
<P>

25   	Her symptoms persisted and while the plaintiff
occasionally ceased physiotherapy treatment it seemed that she did, in fact,
have some therapy of this type during 1998. She was recommended to have massage
therapy and she commenced a regime of that treatment
on 21 January 1999.
<P>

26   	In February 1999 she was again the victim of a motor
vehicle accident, once more when a vehicle in which she was a passenger
was hit
from behind. It was the plaintiff's evidence that while this accident
aggravated her pre-existing condition, that aggravation
lasted for only two
weeks and then her condition returned to that which had previously been the
case.
<P>

27   	She had become pregnant at this stage and indeed gave
birth to a female child on 30 June 1999. The plaintiff claims that her
pain in
her back and neck had continued. She was seen by Drs Isaacs and Hopcroft in
1999. Their views remained the same as before.
<P>

28   	A Dr R Smith, orthopaedic surgeon who saw her on behalf of
her solicitors was of similar views as those expressed by Drs Isaacs
and
Hopcroft.
<P>

29   	At all times following the accident the plaintiff has been
certified by consultant orthopaedic surgeons, particularly Dr Isaacs,
that she
is unfit to carry out the work of an apprentice electrician. Indeed, it is the
view of Drs Hopcroft, Smith and Isaacs that
she is permanently unfit for work
of an tradesman electrician.
<P>

30   	However, those views are not those of others who have seen
her. On behalf of the defendant she has been seen on a number of
occasions over
the years by Dr J Clery. While Dr Clery is of the view that the plaintiff might
have mild pain in her neck due to
a possible annular tear in the C5/6 disc. He
found that her clinical presentation was such as to make him conclude that she
was grossly
exaggerating and that she suffers from little abnormality as a
result of the motor vehicle accident - so much so that he was of the
view that
she was suffering from not more than a permanent impairment of her neck of 5%
and likewise as far as her low back was concerned.
<P>

31   	Dr J M Matheson, consultant neurosurgeon, also found
clinical disparities between her complaints and tests. He was of the
view that
the CT scans were normal. Further that she had faked a straight leg raising
test and that she had no abnormality from the
accident and she was fit for
work. That view was expressed on 3 December 1998.
<P>

32   	Additionally, the defendant relied upon the fact that the
plaintiff had been seen when a young girl by Dr G Kerridge, orthopaedic
surgeon, in July 1990 when the plaintiff was thirteen years of age. She had
seen Dr Kerridge as a result of a reference from Dr Balaz
complaining of pain
in her hip. As I would understand Dr Kerridge's report on that date he was of
the view that pain was associated
with normal growth.
<P>

33   	It is plain from the reading of the reports of Drs Clery
and Matheson that they are of the view that the plaintiff is in fact
fabricating symptoms. In support of that position the defendant tendered in
evidence, film taken of the plaintiff in January and
June 1997, February 1998
and March, April, July, September and October 1999.
<P>

34   	The film principally depicted the plaintiff walking,
standing and driving her motor vehicle. At no time did the film show
the
plaintiff carrying out any extensive physical activity.
<P>

35   	During cross-examination the plaintiff stated that while
she avoided performing certain physical actions because of the onset
of pain
when performing those actions, there were times when it was not possible for
her to avoid performing such movements when
that occasioned she in fact
performed them. 
<P>

36   	She did not deny that she was able to drive a motor car or
can shop - activities depicted in the film. It should be noted
that in one part
of the film exposed the plaintiff was seen in company with her mother and the
plaintiff's daughter. This, of course,
was recently taken because, as I have
said, the plaintiff's daughter was born on 30 June this year. The
transportation of the plaintiff's
daughter involved the use of a stroller. It
was the plaintiff's mother who in fact positioned the stroller in the boot of
the car
being used. In my view the matter depicted in the film was not of
assistance to the defendant's contention that the plaintiff was
fabricating her
symptoms. Indeed, to a certain extent the film was confirmatory of the
plaintiff's statements as to her attitude
towards performing certain physical
actions.
<P>

37   	Having weighed the evidence, I am of the view that the
plaintiff has established, on a balance of probabilities, that she
suffers the
disability which she alleges.
<P>

38   	I turn then to the consequences of that finding upon her
employability and general disability.
<P>

39   	At the time of the accident the plaintiff had been
accepted as an apprentice by an organisation known as Hunter Group Training.
That company employs apprentices and trainees and then leases such people to
employers. The company commenced in 1980 with government
assistance in order to
facilitate the engagement of apprentices in the Hunter region.
<P>

40   	The plaintiff had been contracted out by that company to
Port Waratah Coal Service where she was to undertake a four year
apprenticeship
as an electrician. Not only was she engaged in the associated trade course with
her work as an apprentice but she
was also completing a diploma in electrical
technology which, on its completion, would allow her to undertake professional
work in
the electrical engineering field as against a trade qualification.
<P>

41   	She had completed her Higher School Certificate at the end
of 1994 and had obtained a very good result but one below her actual
capacity.
I say this because in her last year at school she contracted glandular fever
with consequent disruptive effect upon her
ability to perform her school
work.
<P>

42   	In the light of my finding as to her disability as a
consequence of the accident she has been unable to carry out her work
as an
apprentice electrician and accepting as I do the opinion of Drs Isaacs,
Ghabrial and Hopcroft I find her permanently unfit
to carry out the work in the
electrical trade.
<P>

43   	However, as I shall indicate later in these reasons I am
of the view that the plaintiff's intellectual capacity is such that
she is able
to earn in non-manual fields, income. In other words while physically disabled
from performing work involving manual
and physical demands she is fit for
sedentary work and has a capability for so doing.
<P>

44   	The plaintiff, as I have said, married on 1 March 1997.
She and her husband who had known each other since school days intended
to
defer commencing a family until after she had completed her trade and
professional qualifications. Her husband, I might add, is
also an electrician.
He works as an automotive electrician with the State Transit Authority at
Brookvale. It was only following the
plaintiff's injury that a decision was
made to commence a family at an earlier time.
<P>

45   	The plaintiff's mother gave evidence of the assistance she
affords her daughter in performing house work and caring for the
plaintiff's
infant daughter. That assistance occupies some ten hours per week.
<P>

46   	Evidence was given by Mr Wallace from the Hunter Group in
relation to not only the mode of employment of the plaintiff at
the time of her
injury but also as to future prospects. It was his view as a person who was
well experienced in employment opportunities
in the Hunter district that the
plaintiff had excellent prospects. That view to a certain extent was in my
view, confirmed by the
evidence of Di Caldwell who is a specialist adviser in
personnel at Port Waratah Coal Service.
<P>

47   	Had the plaintiff successfully completed her trade and
professional courses I am of the view that the probabilities are that
she would
have been able to obtain employment with either Port Waratah as an electrician
or in some equivalent job with another employer.
<P>

48   	I return to the matter I mentioned earlier in these
reasons and that involves the plaintiff's capacity for work. Tendered
in
evidence was a report from Mr C Bass, a psychologist with considerable
experience in assessing the capacity of people to engage
in the work force.
<P>

49   	He saw the plaintiff on 18 March 1999 at which time he not
only interviewed her but carried out a series of tests designed
to measure her
intellectual potential and clerical aptitude. He found that her tests resulted
in her falling, in terms of intellectual
potential, within the superior and
very superior ranges and that her test relating to clerical aptitude revealed
that she was very
fast and accurate when performing routine clerical tasks.
<P>

50   	In the light of the view held as to her ability by persons
such as Mr Wallace and her very good HSC results when, as I have
noted her
studies were interrupted by illness, comes as no surprise.
<P>

51   	If the plaintiff had, as was anticipated, finished her
apprenticeship at the end of this year she would, as of 1 January 2000
be
capable of earning as an electrical trades person, working for Port Waratah, a
net wage of $1,265 per week.
<P>

52   	In the light of her intellectual capacity and I am of the
view that her physical problems would not prevent her carrying out
sedentary
work, say as an electrical engineering associate, she would in my view be able
to earn a higher than average income.
<P>

53   	Doing the best I can I am of the view that the present
differential between the plaintiff's ability to earn in her present
state as
against her state uninjured should be quantified in the sum of $250 per
week.
<P>

54   	As far as her future medical expenses are concerned, the
plaintiff's counsel has submitted that a sum of $40,000 should be
allowed
including the cost of future surgery in the sum of $15,000. Her claim involves
future visits to general practitioners and
specialists, physiotherapy and
hydrotherapy and pharmaceutical expenses. If the contemplated surgery were to
be successful then the
need for much of the treatment and need for examination
would be obviated. It may be of course, that she will not undertake the
proposed
surgery. In the circumstances I am of the view that a reasonable
allowance for future medical expenses is $20,000.
<P>

55   	As far as home care is concerned I accept that since her
date of marriage her mother has been assisting her for about ten
hours per week
on average. I therefore allow, using a rate of $15.28 per hour, which is agreed
by the parties to be a reasonable
rate, the sum of $21,239.20 for past
assistance.
<P>

56   	For the future a claim is made for 59 years into the
future, taking her to the age of eighty-one which is her life expectancy.
As I
have said if she were to undergo surgery and the surgery was successful her
need for ten hours assistance would no doubt dwindle
or perhaps even disappear.
Therefore it strikes me as being highly problematic that she will require
assistance of the level claimed
for the time claimed. It seems to me that this
is not a matter which can be dealt with by way of a precise actuarial
calculation.
I believe a global approach should be taken to this claim and in
my view an allowance of $50,000 is reasonable in the circumstances.
<P>

57   	The plaintiff's past loss of earnings, mathematically,
comes to $72,785.60. In light of my findings as to her physical disability
from
the date of the accident to the date of trial I would allow this amount in
full.
<P>

58   	Her loss of future earning capacity I have found to be
quantifiable at $250 per week. Assuming that she would work for forty-three
years, a multiplier of 703.8 is created by the actuarial 5% tables. Allowing
15% for vicissitudes a figure of $149,557.50 emerges
under this head.
<P>

59   	Having regard to the plaintiff's age, she having been born
on 10 June 1977, her past disability and the problems she will
suffer in the
future, including her loss to take part in sport, I am of the view that I
should award, pursuant to s 79A of the <b>Motor Accidents Act</b>, 50% of the
most extreme case, which quantifies at $136,500.
<P>

60   	I tabulate her loss as follows:
<P>

Out-of-pocket expenses	14,543.82
<P>

Past wage loss	72,785.60
<P>

Future wage loss	149,557.50
<P>

Non-economic loss	136,500.00
<P>

Future medical expenses	20,000.00
<P>

Past home assistance	21,239.20
<P>

Future home assistance	<u>50,000.00</u>
<P>

	464,626.12
<P>

61   	I thus assess the plaintiff's damages in the sum of
$464,626.12. I will defer making an order for judgment until after the
delivery
of these reasons so that the parties can check the mathematics and I defer
making an order for costs until after delivery
of these reasons.
