<P>

	<b>JUDGMENT  </b>(Notices to Produce)
<P>

1	Two Notices to Produce were served by the plaintiff's solicitors on the
defendant's solicitors on 4 and 5 February respectively.
<P>

2	Their service arises in the following circumstances:
<P>

3	In each action the defendant has pleaded justification pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 15</a> and
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">16</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act, 1974</a></i>.  In each action appended to the relevant
pleading are particulars of the defences of justification in respect to the
relevant imputations
or contextual imputations (see SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/index.html#p67" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 67</a> rr 14, 15, 18(1),
(5) and (6)).
<P>

4	By letters dated 6 and 7 January 1999 the defendant's solicitors informed the
plaintiff's solicitors in each action respectively
of its intention that at the
trial it would rely upon what are described as "<i>further facts, matters and
circumstances</i>" in relation to the pleas of justification.  Shortly stated,
the proposed additional material involves three people, D13, D 14 and
D15. Very
shortly stated, the additional material particularises allegations involving
these three people and conduct towards them
by the plaintiff and particularly
at a certain establishment at Kings Cross.
<P>

5	On Thursday 4 February 1999 "<i>discussion"</i> took place and submissions
were made as to whether or not it was appropriate for the defendant to be
permitted to pursue, at trial,
its amended case on justification in respect of
these three new allegations (as I shall described them).  In the course of
those
proceedings on that day an affidavit sworn by Mr Potter, solicitor for
the plaintiff, of 3 February 1999, was filed in Court, to
which is annexed a
body of material sourced in either the defendant's discovered documents or in
material obtained under subpoenas
issued by the plaintiff.
<P>

6	Later in the proceedings on that day an affidavit by the solicitor for the
defendant, Mr Angus, sworn 4 February 1999, was filed
in Court.  The
proceedings progressed to the point where Mr Barker Q.C. for the plaintiff
announced his intention to cross-examine
Mr Angus upon that affidavit. 
<P>

7	Upon the resumption of proceedings on 9 February an affidavit sworn on 8
February by Mr Angus was filed in Court making amendments
to his affidavit of 4
February;  a further affidavit of Mr Potter was filed in Court attaching a page
numbered 35 which had been
omitted from his original affidavit sworn on 3
February.
<P>

8	The Court was also provided with a copy of a letter dated 1 February 1999
from the solicitors for the defendant to the solicitors
for the plaintiff
referring to a Notice to Produce dated 25 January returnable on 4 February.  I
have not seen that Notice to Produce.
 The letter however, sets out the
defendant's proposed responses to what I gather to be the various paragraphs of
that earlier Notice
to Produce.
<P>

9	Upon a call being made by Mr Reynolds S.C. for the plaintiff upon the two
Notices to Produce with which I am presently concerned,
the defendant, as I
understand it, moved to set those Notices aside as oppressive by reason of the
<i>"breadth</i>" of material called for (an abuse of process) and on the basis
that it was a disguised demand for discovery.
<P>

10	The response by Mr Reynolds to the position taken by the defendant involved,
first, a consideration of what was submitted to
be the relevant principles
applicable to the determination of the question as to whether or not the
defendant should be allowed to
amend.  At this point there was some discussion
as to whether or not that which the defendant was seeking to do was to amend
its
defence or to amend the case (by adding the three new complainants) it
proposes to make in support of the defence already pleaded
(see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/index.html#p20" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 20</a> and in
particular, the learned editors commentary in paragraph 20.1.6. of
<i>Ritchie</i>'s "<i>Supreme Court Procedure"</i>).  There is no need at this
point to decide that issue.
<P>

11	It was argued for the plaintiff that in the end the relevant considerations
boil down to four in number:  (a)  due diligence
must have been shown by the
defendant;  (b)  there must have been full disclosure by the defendant;  (c)
that the delay in seeking
leave for amendment must be shown not to have been
deliberate in order to overreach the plaintiff or obtain some tactical
advantage;
 (d)  the proposed amendment must be meritorious, that is, not
"<i>futile</i>".
<P>

12	These propositions (which were not acceded to by Mr Nicholas Q.C. for the
defendant) were founded in the statements of principle
in the 9th ed of
<i>Gatley on Libel &amp; Slander</i> at pages 703-4 in that section where the
learned authors deal (paragraph 27.33) with the grant of leave to amend
particularly in
relation to a plea of justification.  The principal authorities
upon which these summarised considerations are based are <b><i>Cropper v
Smith</i></b> (1884) 26 Ch. d 700;  <b><i>Cadam v Beaverbrook Newspapers
Limited </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%201%20QB%20413" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959) 1 QB 413</a>;  <b><i>Associated Leisure v Associated
Newspapers </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%202%20QB%20450" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 2 QB 450.</a>  I was also referred to the judgment of
Miles CJ in <b><i>Perkins v Nationwide News </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nt/NTSC/1992/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] NTSC 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20106%20FLR%20373" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 106 FLR 373.</a>
<P>

13	In the light of the enunciation of these asserted principles, and
particularly those concerned with due diligence (delay) and
full disclosure, Mr
Reynolds then embarked upon an analysis of the affidavit of Mr Angus relating
to each of these areas and particularly
to argue that either at common law or
under the provisions of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i>, <i>1995</i> (ss 122 and 126),
there had been a waiver of legal professional privilege warranting the full
disclosure of the material embraced
by the Notices to Produce.
<P>

14	For immediate purposes I will use the affidavit filed by Mr Angus in the
first matter (20223/95).  It is 19 paragraphs in length
and paragraphs 1, 2, 9,
11, 12, 16 and 18 are not of immediate concern.  
<P>

15	In paragraph 3 Mr Angus swears:
<P>

	<i>"Prior to 11 November 1998 the defendant had made various attempts to
obtain the assistance of D13.  Until 13 November 1998, D13 had
refused to meet
with the defendant's solicitors".</i>
<P>

16	It is argued for the plaintiff that the very terms of this paragraph point
to non-disclosure in relation to the identification
of the "<i>attempts"</i>,
for example.  Non-disclosure is apparent with respect to the
"<i>refusal</i>"<i>.  </i>There must have been communications in regard to the
matters deposed to in this paragraph.  It is to be assumed that on 11 November
D13 agreed to meet with the defendants solicitors.  The plaintiff is entitled,
it is argued, to all documents and things relating
to what must necessarily
have been the communications involved in the matters to which Mr Angus deposes
in this paragraph.
<P>

17	It is argued that this paragraph identifies, at least, communications with
potential witnesses and thus, in some way, constitutes
a waiver of privilege
that would otherwise apply in that regard.  
<P>

18	In paragraph 4 Mr Angus deposes (as amended by his affidavit of 8 February),
to a conversation between himself and Greg Quail.
 First there appears to be
some issue as to the precise status of Mr Quail vis-a-vis the defendant.  It is
contended that he is not
an employee, it is questioned whether he is an agent
and it is asserted that he is a "<i>contractor"</i>.  During the course of
argument a document was handed up which on its face appears to be an agreement
dated 13 February 1996 between
the defendant and Apogee Pty Limited, Mr Quail's
company.  The status of the document as "<i>handed up</i>" was unresolved.  On
the assumption however that Mr Quail enjoys the status attributed to him by the
plaintiff, it is argued that
the affidavit generally is deficient in relation
communications with or by Mr Quail with the defendant, the defendant's
solicitors
and the proposed witnesses.  Further, it is argued that the selected
disclosure of part of the conversation amounts to a waiver of
privilege that
would otherwise attach to the communication between Mr Angus and Mr Quail.
<P>

19	Paragraph 5 of the affidavit refers to a meeting being arranged by a
Melbourne solicitor with the defendant's firm and its cancellation
by D13.
This again, it is argued, points to the fact that there must have been
communications in relation to these arrangements,
their cancellation, and the
exposure of those events in paragraph 5 amounts to a sufficient waiver of
privilege that would attach
to communications between the defendant and its
potential witness.
<P>

20	Paragraph 6 refers to advice given by Mr Wheelhouse of counsel on 13
November 1998 to the effect that the defendant could not
rely on a defence of
justification based on evidence that D13 might be expected to give until D13
had provided a signed statement
containing the evidence that he would give if
so required.  This paragraph deposes to what is described as "<i>core</i>"
privileged material but is framed in terms as to constitute a waiver thereof,
the nature of the advice of Mr Wheelhouse having been
disclosed, and points to
the existence of material, it is said, upon which such advice was given.
<P>

21	In paragraph 7 Mr Angus deposes to arrangements between Mr Thompson and D13
for a meeting to take place on 9 December, Mr Thompson
informing Mr Angus that
the meeting took place as arranged and Mr Thompson handing to Mr Angus a
statement signed by D13.  The defendant
asserts privilege in relation to that
signed statement.  Similar arguments in relation to communications and the
waiver of privilege
are made in relation to the matters deposed to in this
paragraph.  
<P>

22	In paragraph 8 of his affidavit Mr Angus deposes that on 18 December he sent
to Mr Wheelhouse a copy of the statement signed
by D13.  Pausing there Mr
Reynolds points to the lapse of one month between the time the advice was
received (13 November 1998) from
Mr Wheelhouse and the forwarding to Mr
Wheelhouse of the signed statement, to the need for which Mr Wheelhouse had
referred in his
advice.  The nature of the advice sought on 14 December from Mr
Wheelhouse is disclosed in paragraph 8, as is the advice that Mr
Wheelhouse
gave that D13 should be called as a witness.  Mr Wheelhouse was to draft
additional particulars "<i>in accordance with the statement signed by
D13</i>".
<P>

23	The next relevant matter is referred to in paragraph 10 where Mr Angus
deposes that on 5 January he "<i>checked and settled" </i>the particulars of
justification drafted by Mr Wheelhouse based upon the statement by D13 on 9
December 1998.  It is argued that Mr
Angus has been less than full in his
disclosure of the circumstances to explain the lapse of time between the
forwarding of the statement
to Mr Wheelhouse on 14 December and Mr Angus'
settling of the particulars on 5 January.  Indeed, it is argued that the
defendant
would be entitled to consider the particulars as settled and
delivered in the light of the material contained in the statement signed
by
D13.  Further, the defendant is entitled to an explanation as to why it was
that it was necessary for Mr Angus to "<i>check and settle</i>" a draft
prepared by Mr Wheelhouse.
<P>

24	With respect to paragraphs 13, 14, 15 and 17 (dealing with D15) the same
objections are made and submissions advanced as I have
referred to in respect
of the preceding paragraphs.
<P>

25	Paragraph 19 of Mr Angus' affidavit states:
<P>

	<i>"The particulars in respect of the statements signed by D13 and D15
respectively were supplied to Phillips Fox at the earliest opportunity
the
defendant had to supply those particulars"</i>
<P>

26	This paragraph, in particular, was seized upon by Mr Reynolds.  The letter
of particulars sets out the particulars of the <i>case</i> the defendant
proposes to make, yet Mr Angus has deposed to providing particulars in respect
of the "<i>statements</i>".  The wording of paragraph 19 amounts to a waiver of
privilege as to the content of the statements.
<P>

27	The affidavit sworn by Mr Angus in the second action (20592/96) follows
virtually the same format as the affidavit with which
I have been dealing.
Similar submissions are to be taken to have been in relation to that
affidavit.
<P>

28	Paragraph 19 of the affidavit filed by Mr Angus in the second action is in
the same terms as the affidavit in the first action.
<P>

29	It is to be noted that both affidavits refer only to D13 and D15.  The
references to D14 are in the letters of particulars of
the proposed amended
case and upon my reading of them it appears that evidence in relation to D14
arguably could be taken to be sourced
in D13;  that is, there appears to be, at
this stage, no reference to any material directly involving D14 in terms of
statements.
 Certainly there is no reference in Mr Angus' affidavits to steps
taken in relation to D14, discretely.
<P>

30	I add that the material annexed to the affidavit of Mr Potter and the
contents of Mallesons letter of 1 February 1999 refer to
the participation (a
word I use as neutrally as possible) of a Mr Collin Hughes solicitor and
similar submissions are made in relation
to communications with that person in
respect of the client (and potential witness) of that solicitor.
<P>

31	Thus, in summary, it is argued, that given the application of the principles
in relation to amendment encapsulated in the four
propositions referred to
earlier in these reasons, an analysis of Mr Angus' affidavit discloses that
there has not been full disclosure,
that contrary to the assertion of the
defendant that all its "<i>cards have been laid on the table</i>", the bulk of
the "<i>deck</i>" has been concealed and there has been effectively waiver of
privilege in all the areas the subject of matters deposed to by Mr Angus.
<P>

32	In respect to waiver of privilege I was specifically referred to the
decision of the Court of Appeal in <b><i>Akins v Abigroup </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/254.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 254</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20539" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43
NSWLR 539</a> and a most useful decision of Sackville J in <b><i>Towney v Minister
for Land &amp; Water Conversation for the State of New South Wales</i></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2076%20FCR%20401" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 76 FCR 401particularly</a> at 413-4 and his Honour's discussion of <b><i>AG
(NT) v Maurice</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/80.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 80</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20161%20CLR%20475" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 161 CLR 475.</a>  I do not propose to rehearse the
submissions in this regard.  Suffice to say, it is Mr Reynolds contention that
both under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></i> and at common law (particularly on a
<b><i>Maurice</i></b> fairness basis), there has been a waiver of privilege
that would entitle the plaintiff to all the material sought to be encompassed
by the Notices to Produce.
<P>

33	For the defendant it was contended by Mr Nicholas Q.C. that the four basic
propositions do not necessarily reflect the finite
law in regard to amendments
in relation to a plea of justification.  The overriding principles are those
enunciated, it is submitted,
by the High Court in the <b><i>State of Queensland
&amp; Anor v J L Holdings Pty Limited</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%2d7%29%20189%20CLR%20146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996-7) 189 CLR 146</a> particularly
at 154, 155, 164 and 169.  This is what I will describe as the "<i>interests of
justice</i>" consideration which, as I understood the submission by Mr Nicholas
Q.C., must transcend any particular consideration of elements
of the kind
encapsulated in the plaintiff's four propositions.  This area for argument, in
my view, will in the end go to whether
or not leave should be granted but I
take it to be advanced at this stage in response to the enunciation of
principle by Mr Reynolds
to lay the ground work for his more specific
submissions on Mr Angus' affidavit in support of the propriety of the Notices
to Produce.
 In the course of argument I was referred by Mr Nicholas to two of
my own judgments:   <b><i>Assaf &amp; Anor v Skalkos &amp; Anor
</i></b>(unreported, 5 February 1998) and <b><i>Meekosha &amp; Anor v Special
Broadcasting Service Corporation &amp; Anor</i></b> (unreported, 18 September
1998), in each of which I gave consideration to the application of the <b><i>J
L Holdings</i></b> principles.  I was also referred to the unreported decision
of the Court of Appeal, 1 October 1998, in <b><i>TCN Channel Nine Pty Limited v
Antoniadis</i></b> where, in my view, the Court's consideration of the
amendment component of the appeal is of little present relevance (the defendant
there not relying on any new facts in support of the proposed defences);
otherwise, of course, what the Court said in relation to
amendment generally
and in particular to authorities including <b><i>J L Holdings</i></b> will be
relevant.
<P>

34	The application by the defendant in respect of the amendment is perhaps the
most critical application that has hitherto been
made in anticipation of the
commencement of the hearing of these actions.  Its outcome will be critical to
the position of each side.
 Thus it is that I have taken a short time to
consider the preliminary point as to the propriety of the Notices to Produce.
I am
not deciding, of course, the application in relation to the amendments
themselves. 
<P>

35	In the course of submissions what I will describe as forensic acrimony was
exposed in the following way:  Mr Reynolds asserted
that he was not alleging
<i>mala fides</i> against Mr Angus with respect to his affidavits.  What he did
assert was construed by Mr Nicholas Q.C. as statements that Mr Angus'
affidavit
was the product of dishonesty, that it was telling half truths by reason of it
being carefully crafted, it failed to fully
and frankly disclose matters which
should have been disclosed and it was "<i>cute</i>' (Mr Reynolds' word), in the
selection of the language employed and, shortly stated, was a "<i>sworn
deception</i>" put before me (T119.25).  This "<i>exchange</i>", I suppose, was
inevitable but in the end does not assist in the resolution of the particular
issue I have to decide.  Mr Reynolds'
submissions were most helpful (as were Mr
Nicholas') as was his analysis of Mr Angus' affidavit.  They do not however
amount to a
case in support of the Notices to Produce.  On reading the two
notices I easily come to the view that they are oppressive in their
breadth and
do constitute, in effect, a requirement that the defendant give discovery.  I
propose to set the notices aside. 
<P>

36	In one respect however, I am persuaded by the submissions of Mr Reynolds
that there has been a waiver of privilege and that is
by reason of the terms of
paragraph 19 of each affidavit.  Here Mr Angus deposes to particulars of the
statements having been provided;
 in other words, those particulars are of the
contents of those statements.  He did not depose to the particulars of the
"<i>case</i>" being provided, which case in due course would be proved by
evidence which is set out in the statements.
<P>

37	The appropriate course to adopt to resolve this critical matter that will
affect the trial as a whole, and the appropriate course
to adopt at this time
is to make orders under the relevant Pt 23 of the Supreme Court Rules and in
particular, Pt 23 r 7.  That is,
I propose to order particular discovery.  Save
for the two statements of D13 and D15 referred to in paragraph 19 of each of Mr
Angus'
affidavits, I do not at present find there to have been any waiver of
privilege.
<P>

38	I am further persuaded of the need for an order for specific discovery by
reason of statements made by counsel for the defendant
in the course of
submissions (which even now are not clear) to the effect that but for two or
three documents which Mr Angus had
in Court, all of the documents referred to
in the Notices, other than those in respect of which privilege has been
claimed, have
previously been discovered to the other side.  I appreciate that
on one view that statement by counsel for the defendant is indicative
of an
understanding of what is called for by the Notice to Produce and thus is
capable of operating in derogation of the fundamental
submission, that the
Notices constitute an abuse of process by reason of their breadth and requiring
discovery.  I do not in the
end take a view conformable with that argument.
<P>

39	There seems, at the very least, to be uncertainty as to what has been
discovered in relation to the proposed amendments.  Given
the nature of the
application to amend and its criticality in this action, the interests of
fairness and justice will be served by
requiring the defendant to give specific
discovery in relation to the subject matter of the proposed amendments.  This
will enable
the plaintiff and his advisers more closely and, I trust in a more
focussed way, to decide upon the necessity for and the scope of
any
cross-examination of Mr Angus and the better to argue, if occasion arises as a
result of the required affidavits of discovery,
any question of waiver of
privilege in areas other than that in which I have made a finding favourable to
the plaintiff already.
