<P>

<b>			SURF LIFESAVING AUSTRALIA LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>			&amp; 3 ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Extension of limitation period)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed 21 June 1999 the
plaintiff seeks an extension of time within which to commence proceedings
against the
third and fourth defendant, leave to join the proposed third and
fourth defendants as defendants, leave to file a further amended
statement of
claim, discovery and interrogatories.  Paragraphs (2) and (3) of the notice of
motion (discovery and interrogatories)
are stood over generally with liberty to
restore on 7 days notice.  The plaintiff relied on his affidavits sworn 17 July
1999 and
14 September 1999 and that of his solicitor Melinda Penney sworn 17
June 1999.  The defendant did not rely on any affidavit evidence.
 The
deponents were not cross examined.
<P>

2  	For the purposes of this application I find the following
facts.
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff was born on 24 October 1975.
<P>

(2)	On 30 March 1996 the plaintiff attended the Australian Surf Life Saving
Championships at Kurrawa Beach Queensland.  He attended
a social function held
in the beer compound area.  The beer tent was full and a ball game commenced in
the tent.  The plaintiff was
walking to the bar area when one of the persons
involved in the ball game collided with the plaintiff causing him to suffer a
fracture
of the right fibula and dislocation of the ankle.
<P>

(3)	Up until 17 December 1998 the plaintiff was unaware of his entitlement to
commence proceedings against the organisers of the
event until he consulted
Keddies solicitors.  He had assumed that this incident was simply an accident
and that he would not be able
to claim damages from anyone as he was not aware
of the obligations on the persons who organised the event to ensure that
alcohol
was not served to persons under the influence of alcohol nor was he
aware of the defendant's obligation to protect him from the risk
of injury
which occurred in the beer compound area.
<P>

(4)	On 5 February 1999 the plaintiff's solicitor wrote to Kurrawa Surf Club
requesting particulars to establish the correct defendant
in these
proceedings.
<P>

(5)	On 19 March 1999 as the plaintiff's solicitor had not received a response
to the above letter, she forwarded a reminder letter
by facsimile to Kurrawa
Surf Club.
<P>

(6)	On 19 April 1999 the plaintiff's solicitor received a telephone call from
Michael Smith a solicitor who advised that Kurrawa
Surf Club Incorporation was
a separate entity to Surf Lifesaving Queensland Incorporated.
<P>

(7)	On 29 March 1999 a statement of claim was filed.
<P>

(8)	On 20 April 1999 an amended statement of claim was filed.
<P>

(9)	On 31 May 1999 the plaintiff's solicitor contacted the Queensland Liquor
Licensing Board and ascertained that the license held
by Kurrawa Surf Club was
in fact held by Kurrawa Surf Lifesaving Club Supporters Association.
<P>

(10)	On 21 June 1999 the notice of motion seeking an extension of the
limitation period was filed.
<P>

<b><u>The law</u></b>
<P>

3  	The parties agree that the case is governed by Queensland
legislation and any cause of action the plaintiff may have occurred,
in
Queensland.
<P>

4  	Section 5 <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/colpa1993301/" class="autolink_findacts">Choice of Law (Limitation Periods) Act</a></b> 1993
applies.  It reads:
<P>

<b>"If the substantive law of a place, being another State, a Territory or New
Zealand, is to govern a claim before a court of the State,
a limitation law of
that place is to be regarded as part of that substantive law and applied
accordingly by the court."</b>
<P>

5  	The plaintiff relies on s 30(a(ii) and s 31(1) and (2) of the
<b>Limitation of Actions Act Queensland</b> 1974 (the Act).  The relevant
portion of s 30(a)(ii) states:
<P>

<b>"Interpretation</b>
<P>

<b>30	For the purposes of this section and sections 31, 21, 33 and 34 -</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the material facts relating to a right of action include the following
-</b>
<P>

<b>(i)	...</b>
<P>

<b>(ii)	the identity of the person against whom the rights of action
lies;</b>
<P>

<b>		..."</b>
<P>

6  	Section 31(1) and (2) of the <b>Limitation of Actions Act
Queensland</b> 1974 states:
<P>

<b>"(1)	This section applies to actions for damages for negligence, trespass,
nuisance or breach of duty (whether the duty exists by
virtue of a contract or
a provision made by or under a statute or independently of a contract or such
provision) where the damages
claimed by the plaintiff for the negligence,
trespass, nuisance or breach of duty consist of or include damages in respect
of personal
injury to any person or damages in respect of injury resulting from
the death of any person.</b>
<P>

<b>(2)	Where on application to a court by a person claiming to have a right of
action to which this section applies, it appears to the
court -</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	that a material fact of a decisive character relating to the right of
action was not within the means of knowledge of the applicant
until a date
after the commencement of the year last preceding the expiration of the period
of limited for the action;  and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	that there is evidence to establish the right of action apart from a
defence founded on the expiration of a period of limitation;</b>
<P>

<b>the court may order that the period of limitation for the action be extended
so that it expires at the end of 1 year after that date
and thereupon, for the
purposes of the action brought by the applicant in that court, the period of
limitation is extended accordingly."</b>
<P>

7  	Section 31 confers a discretionary power, and in addition to
satisfying the provisions of s 31(a) and (b), the plaintiff must
show that it
is in the interests of justice to extend time.  The onus of satisfying the
court that the discretion should be exercised
in favour of the plaintiff, rests
on the plaintiff (see <b><u>Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v
Taylor</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20186%20CLR%20541" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 186 CLR 541</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=139%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">139 ALR 1</a>
<P>

8  	In <b><u>Do Carmo v Ford Excavations Pty Limited</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20154%20CLR%20234" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983)
154 CLR 234</a> Dawson J (with whom <b>Brennan J</b> agreed) said that s 58(2)
(which is similar to s 31(2)) involves a three step process.  His Honour
said:
<P>

<b>"The first step is to inquire whether the facts of which the appellant was
unaware were material facts:  s 57(1)(b).  If they were,
the next step is to
ascertain whether they were of a decisive character:  s 57(1)(c).  If so, then
it must be ascertained whether
those facts were within the means of knowledge
of the appellant before the specified date:  s 58(2).</b>
<P>

9  	And in relation to "material facts" Dawson J said:
<P>

<b>"It seems to me that the reference to material facts in para (i) of s
57(1)(b) does not include a reference to a cause of action in
negligence but is
rather a reference to the facts which constitute the acts or omissions,
including those facts which are necessary
to show the negligent character of
those acts or omissions, upon which such a cause of action might be
founded."</b>
<P>

10  	From the facts stated earlier, the plaintiff's solicitor did not
ascertain the identity of the third defendant until 20 April
1999 and the
identity of the fourth defendant until 31 May 1999.  The plaintiff only became
aware that the defendants had an obligation
to protect him from the risk of
injury on 17 December 1998.  On 31 May 1999 the plaintiff became aware of the
identities of the third
and fourth defendants who are alleged to be organisers
of the event when he was advised by his solicitor.  The identity of the third
and fourth defendant are material facts of a decisive character as defined in s
30(a)(ii) of the Act.  The plaintiff was required
to have obtained this
knowledge no earlier than 21 June 1998.  He acquired this knowledge within the
time period stipulated by s
31(2).
<P>

11  	In relation of s 31(2)(b), the third and fourth defendants
submitted that there was no evidence to establish a right of action.
 The
plaintiff's evidence is that he was attending a social function held in the
beer compound area at Kurrawa Surf Club.  A ball
game commenced to be played.
The plaintiff was walking to the bar area when a person involved in the ball
game collided with him.
 It is alleged that each of the defendants promoted,
conducted, organised, co-ordinated and ran a surf carnival at Kurrawa Beach
Queensland and activities associated with the carnival including providing
facilities, food and alcoholic beverages.  It is alleged
that the fourth
defendant held the liquor license for the event. 
<P>

12  	The further amended statement of claim alleges that the
defendants were negligent in that they failed to take any reasonable
precaution
for the safety of the plaintiff;  failed to take any or any reasonable steps to
monitor, supervise and control persons
within the enclosure;  failed to suspend
sales of beer, prevent and/or forbid the contest or take any or any reasonable
steps to
prevent the contest;  failed to take any or any reasonable precaution
to eject persons who were intoxicated and/or otherwise likely
to be involved in
the contest;  failure to provide security guards or put in place other
reasonable security precautions;  selling
beer to persons who were intoxicated;
failed to prevent violent physical contest being waged in close proximity to
members of the
public including the plaintiff and failed to comply with such
licensing and/or other regulatory protocol governing the sale of beer
within
the said enclosure.  It also alleges that they breached their statutory duties
which are particularised. He suffered injuries
and was unfit for six months
namely a fracture of the right fibula and dislocation of the ankle.  There is
medical evidence that
he has suffered damage as a result of the accident.  It
is my view that there is evidence to establish the right of action.  The
plaintiff has passed through the s 31 gateway.
<P>

13  	I turn to consider whether it is just and reasonable to extend
the limitation period.  In <b><u>Taylor</u></b> McHugh J referred to the
effects of delay in the now often quoted passage at p 8 which states:
<P>

<b>"The effect of delay on the quality of justice is no doubt one of the most
important influences motivating a legislature to enact
limitation periods for
commencing actions.  But it is not the only one.  Courts and commentators have
perceived four broad rationales
for the enactment of limitation periods.
First, as time goes by, relevant evidence is likely to be lost.  Secondly, it
is oppressive,
even "cruel", to a defendant to allow an action to be brought
long after the circumstances which gave rise to it have passed.  Thirdly,
people should be able to arrange their affairs and utilise their resources on
the basis that claims can no longer be made against
them.  Insurers, public
institutions and businesses, particularly limited liability companies, have a
significant interest in knowing
that they have no liabilities beyond a definite
period."</b>
<P>

14  	McHugh J at p 10 continued:
<P>

<b>"The discretion to extend should therefore be seen as requiring the
applicant to show that his or her case is a justifiable exception
to the rule
that the welfare of the State is best served by the limitation period in
question. Accordingly, when an applicant seeks
an extension of time to commence
an action after a limitation period has expired, he or she has the positive
burden of demonstrating
that the justice of the case requires that
extension."</b>
<P>

15  	and at page 11 he continued:
<P>

<b>"Legislatures enact limitation periods because they make a judgment, inter
alia, that the chance of an unfair trial occurring after
the limitation period
has expired is sufficiently great to require the termination of the plaintiff's
right of action at the end
of that period.  When a defendant is able to prove
that he or she will not now be able to fairly defend him or herself or that
there
is a significant chance that this is so, the case is no longer one of
presumptive prejudice.  The defendant has then proved what
the legislature
merely presumed would be the case.  Even on the hypothesis of presumptive
prejudice, the legislature perceives that
society is best served by barring the
plaintiff's action.  When actual prejudice of a significant kind is shown, it
is hard to conclude
that the legislature intended that the extension provision
should trump the limitation period.  In such a situation, actual injustice
to
one party must occur.  It seems more in accord with the legislative policy
underlying limitation periods that the plaintiff's
lost right should not be
revived than that the defendant should have a spent liability reimposed upon
it."</b>
<P>

16  	Toohey and Gummow JJ (in their joint judgment) expressed
themselves in the following terms.
<P>

<b>"The real question is whether the delay has made the chances of a fair trial
unlikely.  If it has not there is no reason why the discretion
should not be
exercised in favour of the respondent."</b>
<P>

17  	The third and fourth defendants submitted that they are
prejudiced because Suncorp in its letter of 26 March 1999 states that
its
insured does not have any record or knowledge of the incident.  However, it
further states that their investigations have not
been completed but
preliminary enquiries reveal the event was jointly run by Kurrawa Surf
Lifesaving Club and Surf Life Saving Australia.
The plaintiff went by ambulance
to the Surfers Paradise public hospital and has consulted doctors since the
accident.  These records
are available.  The plaintiff is a young man who has
suffered an injury which rendered him unfit for work for six months and those
injuries may affect his future working life.  The defendants did not adduce any
evidence to establish that they suffer from actual
prejudice.  I accept that
the defendants will suffer some presumptive prejudice, particularly as some of
the witnesses may have been
inebriated and their memories may not be as good as
they could have been at the time of the accident and those memories may have
further faded with the effluxion of time.
<P>

18  	After taking into account all of these matters I am not
satisfied that the chances of the defendant obtaining a fair trial
is unlikely.
Nor am I satisfied that the defendant will suffer significant prejudice.  The
plaintiff has discharged his onus and
satisfied me that it is just and
reasonable to grant leave to commence proceedings.
<P>

19  	The plaintiff is granted leave to add the proposed third and
fourth defendants as defendants to these proceedings.  Leave is
granted to file
a further amended statement of claim within 14 days.
<P>

20  	Costs are discretionary.  It is my view that the appropriate
order for costs is that costs be costs in the cause.
<P>

21  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The plaintiff is granted leave to add the proposed third and fourth
defendants as defendants in these proceedings.
<P>

(2)	Leave is granted to the plaintiff to commence proceedings against the third
and fourth defendant in respect of an accident which
occurred on 30 March
1996.
<P>

(3)	A further amended statement of claim is to be filed and served within 14
days.
<P>

(4)	Costs be costs in the cause.
<P>

(5)	Paragraphs (2) and (3) of the notice of motion filed 21 June 1999 are stood
over generally with liberty to restore on 7 days
notice.
