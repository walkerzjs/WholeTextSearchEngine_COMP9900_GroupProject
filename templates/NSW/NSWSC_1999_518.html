THURSDAY, 3 JUNE 1999
<P>

<b>12913/1998 - COMMONWEALTH DEVELOPMENT BANK OF AUSTRALIA LIMITED v WINDERMERE
PASTORAL CO PTY LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	By a Statement of Claim issued on 30 November 1998 the
plaintiff, Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia Limited, for which
Mr
A.G. Bell of Counsel appeared, sued the defendant, Windermere Pastoral Co Pty
Limited, for which Mr I.E. Davidson of Counsel appeared,
seeking a monetary
judgment of  $1,929,598.43, together with interest thereon, and possession of
the whole of the land contained
in Certificates of Title Folio Identifiers
1/126006 and 1/126009 and known as "Windermere", Currawang Road, Collector in
the State
of New South Wales.
<P>

2   	The Statement of Claim alleged that on or about 18 March
1992 the defendant granted a mortgage, registered number E677085,
to the
plaintiff over the second mentioned piece of land, which mortgage incorporated
the provisions of a Memorandum, registered
number T340042; and that on or about
15 July 1992 the defendant granted a mortgage, registered number E677084, to
the plaintiff over
the first mentioned piece of land, which mortgage
incorporated the provisions of a Memorandum, registered number E212677.  The
Memoranda
set out the detailed terms and conditions.  It was pleaded that the
mortgages were executed in consideration of certain advances
and accommodation
granted or to be granted by the plaintiff to Presswood (Aust) Pty Limited,
which was referred to in the mortgages
as, and to which I shall refer as, "the
debtor".  None of these assertions, including the terms of the mortgages, was
in issue.
<P>

3   	The plaintiff alleged it provided financial accommodation
to the debtor, which was not substantially in issue, although the
amounts
claimed were not admitted.  However, on the application before me there was
evidence of the amounts which, subject to any
defences and cross-claim, are
owing. 
<P>

<b>The Defence and Cross-Claim</b>
<P>

4   	The Defence pleaded:-
<P>

<b>"7.	It was an implied term of the execution of the security provided by the
defendant that the plaintiff, its servants or agents,
would not act in a manner
likely to cause damage to the defendant.</b>
<P>

<b>  8.	In breach of the implied term the plaintiff, by its servants or agents,
caused Presswood (Aust) Pty Ltd (`Presswood') to suffer
loss and damage and
otherwise to act to its detriment for the benefit of the plaintiff.</b>
<P>

<b>  9.	Further, and in the alternative, the security documents executed by the
defendant did not permit the plaintiff to make further
advances without the
consent of the defendant.</b>
<P>

<b>  10.	In breach of the said agreement between the plaintiff and the
defendant the plaintiff advanced further sums to Presswood and
otherwise
controlled the financial dealings of Presswood as a result of which Presswood
suffered loss which the plaintiff now seeks
to recover from the
defendant.</b>
<P>

<b>  11.	The defendant denies that it is indebted to the plaintiff."</b>
<P>

5   	By its Cross-Claim the defendant alleged that in 1990 the
plaintiff offered to provide capital and loan funds to the debtor
in
consideration of an agreement whereby the debtor would accept capital and loan
funds from the plaintiff and otherwise be subject
to its direction.  The
plaintiff advanced $600,000 as capital, and $1,360,000 by way of loan.  It was
pleaded that in consideration
of the representations and encouragement by the
plaintiff the debtor closed its Goulburn premises and invested money in land
and
buildings to erect a factory at Tumut, and that it was a term and condition
of the advance of funds by the plaintiff that it would
become "an equitable
owner" in the debtor's business, and that in about 1992 the plaintiff acquired
46.7% of the issued capital of
the debtor.
<P>

6   	It was pleaded that in 1994 the plaintiff appointed Mr
Peter Thomas, one of its senior managers, to act as a director of the
debtor
and, thereby, exercised control and influence in the decisions of the debtor as
he was acting as agent for the plaintiff;
and that Mr Thomas gave advice as to
the manner in which the debtor should conduct its financial dealings, collected
invoices and
made decisions as to the advance of funds to the debtor.
<P>

7   	The pleading continued that in about 1992 the debtor
received a request from a purchaser in Korea for the supply of wood product,
which necessitated the investment by it in a further mill in its plant at
Tumut; that the financial and investment advice of the
debtor was effectively
controlled by Mr Thomas, who represented to the debtor that the second mill
should be installed and funded
from reserves and, if needed, with further funds
from the plaintiff.  It was pleaded that Mr Thomas assumed responsibility for
the
negotiation and advice to the plaintiff in relation to the financial
circumstances of the debtor, and that it was reasonably possible
for the debtor
to repay its indebtedness to the plaintiff, but that the plaintiff changed a
policy in relation to advances and the
status of its equity division and,
thereby, withdrew financial support to the debtor.
<P>

8   	It was pleaded that the plaintiff issued a demand for the
repayment of funds to the Tumut premises of the debtor when it knew,
or should
have known, that the factory was closed for the Christmas vacation; that it
refused, neglected or failed to entertain discussions
with the remaining
directors of the debtor; that Mr Thomas resigned as a director of the debtor on
4 April 1996; that his resignation
was shortly prior to the issue of a demand
or notice by the plaintiff for the payment of money alleged to be due; that the
plaintiff
advised the debtor that the financial affairs of the plaintiff had
been "handed over" to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia; that
the defendant
does not know the relationship between the plaintiff and the Commonwealth Bank
of Australia in regard to the transfer
of the debtor's financial affairs; and
that the plaintiff appointed a Receiver to the debtor's business when there was
no compliance
with its demand for payment.
<P>

9   	It was further pleaded that Mr Thomas was at all times
acting as an agent of the plaintiff and, further or in the alternative,
was
under a fiduciary duty to the debtor not to cause its financial dealings to be
intermingled with the financial dealings of the
plaintiff.  It was pleaded that
he failed or neglected to act in accordance with his fiduciary duty to the
debtor and preferred to
act for the benefit of the plaintiff; that the debtor
is not indebted to the plaintiff in the sum alleged to be owing "and this sum
is not properly due to the plaintiff"; that the plaintiff now seeks to recover
the amount advanced by it to the debtor from the defendant;
and, further and in
the alternative, the defendant is entitled to be indemnified by the plaintiff
in relation to any sum found to
be due to it.
<P>

10   	The Cross-Claim continued:-
<P>

<b>"29.	The cross-defendant is estopped from seeking recovery from the
cross-claimant because of the actions of the cross-defendant,
its servants or
agents.</b>
<P>

<b>  30.	The security documents referred to in paragraphs 4 and 7 of the
Statement of Claim executed by the cross-claimant are in the
nature of a
guarantee for the debts of Presswood.</b>
<P>

<b>  31.	The security documents referred to in paragraph 30 hereof were
executed in circumstances which were harsh and unconscionable
and should be set
aside."</b>
<P>

11   	The Cross-Claim sought declarations that Mr Thomas acted
as agent for the plaintiff, was in breach of his fiduciary duty to
the debtor
and intermingled the affairs of the defendant and the debtor.  Judgment was
sought against the plaintiff in the sum now
claimed by it, as was an
indemnification for any amount due by the debtor to the plaintiff.
Declarations were also sought that the
plaintiff is estopped from seeking any
orders or judgments against the defendant, and that the security documents be
set aside.
<P>

<b>The Present Notice Of Motion</b>
<P>

12   	By a Notice of Motion filed on 21 May 1999 the plaintiff
sought orders that the Defence and Cross-Claim be struck out, on
the basis that
they failed to disclose any defence or reasonable cause of action, and for
summary judgment.  It sought other relief
with which, for the moment, it is
unnecessary to deal.  The Notice of Motion was supported by the affidavit of Mr
Michael Patrick
Quinn, a manager of credit management, sworn 21 May 1999, and
to which the various security documents and statements of the defendant's
indebtedness as at 19 May 1999 were annexed.
<P>

13   	The plaintiff's case is that the defendant, as in effect a
guarantor, cannot, conformably with authority, rely on a defence,
set-off or
cross-claim to the claims against it under the mortgages, which defence,
set-off or cross-claim would arguably be available
to the debtor if it were
sued. Part of this submission involves the proposition that the terms of the
mortgages, on their proper
construction, preclude such reliance by the
defendant by making it liable for the full amount claimed from the debtor
without deduction,
and not merely for the amount that the debtor is obliged to
pay to the plaintiff after any deductions flowing, for example, from
a
successful defence or cross-claim.
<P>

14   	The defendant submitted that a proper construction did not
lead to the conclusion for which the plaintiff contended; that
the line of
authority on which the plaintiff relied did not have the result of precluding
the defence, set-off and cross-claim in
the circumstances of this case; that
the particular relationship between the parties gave rise to obligations which
were enforceable
by the defendant in all the circumstances of this case; and
that it was inappropriate, at this stage, to strike out the defence and
cross-claim.
<P>

<b>Some Preliminary Matters</b>
<P>

15   	Mr Bell agreed that in this application the plaintiff must
accept the truth of the matters pleaded in the pleadings sought
to be struck
out.  I have set out the terms of the Cross-Claim and, in due course, it will
be necessary to look at what the evidence
established was the relationship
between the plaintiff and the debtor.  However, for present purposes, Mr Bell's
concession led to
an acceptance of the following:-
<P>

 (a)	The plaintiff exercised control and influence in the decisions of the
debtor;
<P>

(b)	Mr Thomas was a director of the debtor and was acting as the plaintiff's
agent;
<P>

(c)	Mr Thomas gave advice to the debtor as to how it should conduct its
financial affairs and dealings;
<P>

(d)	Mr Thomas effectively controlled the financial and investment advice of the
debtor;
<P>

(e)	Mr Thomas assumed responsibility for the negotiation and advice to the
plaintiff in relation to the financial circumstances
of the debtor; and
<P>

(f)	the plaintiff changed its policy in relation to advances and changed the
status of its equity division and "thereby withdrew
financial support to" the
debtor.
<P>

16   	It is clear from these matters that the plaintiff, through
Mr Thomas, exercised substantial, if not complete, control over
the financial
fortunes of the debtor and, to that extent, was in a position, at least prima
facie, to regulate its indebtedness and,
therefore, the amount for which the
defendant could ultimately become liable.  This was obviously done in
circumstances where Mr
Thomas understood that the debtor's indebtedness to the
plaintiff was supported by the defendant's mortgages.  The potential for
conflict of interest must have been clear.
<P>

17   	The onus upon the plaintiff to obtain the relief it sought
was not in issue.  In <b>Air Services Australia v Zarb</b> (Court of Appeal -
26 August 1998 - unreported) I gathered various judgments in which the relevant
principles have been enunciated:
<b>Dey v Victorian Railway Commissioners</b>

 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20188%20CLR%20241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 188 CLR 241</a> and <b>NRMA Insurance Limited v A.W. Edwards Pty Limited</b>
(Court of Appeal - 11 November 1994 - unreported). 
<P>

18   	In <b>Zarb</b>, which was an appeal from a refusal to
strike out a Statement of Claim, the Court was considering a potentially
expanding or changing
area of the law of negligence in relation to whether a
duty of care was owed by the defendant to the plaintiff in the circumstances
of
that case.  The defendant relied upon portion of the decision of the High Court
in <b>Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20157%20CLR%20425" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 157 CLR 425</a>, but it appeared
to me, and to Priestley JA who agreed with my decision, that the decisions of
the High Court in <b>Pyrenees Shire Council v Day</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2072%20ALJR%20152" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 72 ALJR 152</a> and
<b>Romeo v Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory</b> (1998) 72 ALJR
208 may require that decision to be revisited, at least in so far as the point
at issue in <b>Zarb</b> was concerned.  Even if that were not so those
decisions provided support for the basic proposition that the plaintiff may
have a
good cause of action when all the facts were found.  That was sufficient
to cause Priestley JA and me to dismiss the appeal.
<P>

19   	Powell JA dissented.  His Honour was of the view that the
plaintiff's case was so weak that it almost certainly would fail,
and pointed
out various difficulties which led him to that conclusion.  An application for
special leave to appeal to the High Court
was refused.
<P>

20   	The plaintiff must therefore meet the onerous test which
applies to a strike out application, in circumstances where the defendant
is
relying on an equitable set-off and a claim for damages for breach of fiduciary
duty in the particular factual situation presented
by this case.  There is a
similarity with <b>Zarb</b> in that the legal considerations applicable to the
existence of a fiduciary duty, when it may be breached and the consequences of
such a breach is a developing area of the law.  Further, questions of equitable
set-off depend on the particular circumstances of
each case.
<P>

21   	In <b>Beach Petroleum NL v Abbott Tout Russell Kennedy</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2026%20ACSR%20114" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 26 ACSR 114</a> I gathered a number of the authorities dealing with
fiduciary duties, including <b>Commonwealth Bank of Australia &amp; Anor v
Smith</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1991/375.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] FCA 375</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20102%20ALR%20453" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 102 ALR 453</a>, which dealt directly with the fiduciary duty
owed, or potentially owed, by a bank to a customer.  It may be said that this
raises
a somewhat different issue from that presently before me.  On the other
hand it may not because the defendant seeks to rely on an
equitable set-off or
cross-claim derivatively. Further, this case may depend on the correct legal
and/or equitable characterisation
of the position of Mr Thomas and a working
out of the potential conflicts of interest to which I referred.
<P>

22   	In any event, the extent of fiduciary duty and the
obligations it imposes is the subject of continuing development.  The decisions
of the High Court in <b>Maguire &amp; Anor v Makaronis &amp; Anor</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20188%20CLR%20449" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997)
188 CLR 449</a> and <b>O'Halloran v R.T. Thomas &amp; Family Pty Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/596.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 596</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2045%20NSWLR%20262" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998)
45 NSWLR 262</a>, in my respectful opinion, make this clear, and the Court of
Appeal has reserved its decision in the appeal from my decision in <b>Beach
Petroleum</b>.  In the circumstances, and faced with the prima facie factual
situation to which I have referred, I consider that it would be a
bold
statement to assert that the defendant's defence and cross-claim sank to the
level of the strike out tests.
<P>

23   	In the present case it will be necessary to determine
whether the authorities upon which Mr Bell has relied are so clear as
to
overcome the view I have just expressed.
<P>

<b>The Deed Of 18 March 1992</b>
<P>

24   	On 18 March 1992 the debtor entered into a Deed, Exhibit 2
on the application, which recited that it, its directors and shareholders
had
invited the plaintiff to subscribe for shares, which the plaintiff had agreed
to do, on the terms and conditions and subject
to the representations and
warranties set out in the Deed.  A number of the Deed's provisions placed the
financial position of the
debtor under the control of the plaintiff.
<P>

25   	Clause 7 provided for the appointment of a director by the
plaintiff and stated, inter alia:-
<P>

<b>"It is expressly acknowledged by the parties hereto that any such director
is or will be appointed as the representative of CDB and
shall be entitled,
subject to law, to vote at any meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company
or such Subsidiary (as the case
may be) in the manner directed by CDB and in
the interests of CDB."</b>
<P>

This was the provision pursuant to which Mr Thomas was appointed, and it
defined his role.
<P>

26   	Mr Davidson also relied upon the General Negative
Covenants set forth in clause 6.02, whereby the debtor covenanted and agreed
with the plaintiff that it "shall not at any time ... without the prior written
consent of" the plaintiff do various things including
borrowing or raising any
money; encumbering the whole or any part of its assets; purchasing or acquiring
assets having a market value
in excess of that specified; entering into any
long term contract or contracts containing onerous or unusual provisions having
regard
to its customary business; and making certain payments.  The purpose of
these references was to show the extent to which the debtor
was under the
financial control of the plaintiff, which is consistent with the acceptance of
the truth of the facts pleaded. 
<P>

27   	The Deed and the affidavit of a director of the defendant,
Mr Leon William Reardon, sworn 26 May 1999, upon which the defendant
relied,
showed another relationship between the defendant and the debtor.  The Deed
disclosed that Mr Reardon was a director and
shareholder of the debtor.  In
paragraph 8 of his affidavit, Mr Reardon deposed:-
<P>

<b>"The plaintiff placed itself in a position of control of voting of the
business of Presswood and controlled the flow of funds to Presswood
by loans
and decision making.  The plaintiff appointed a representative to the Board of
Presswood and exercised control.  The plaintiff
withdrew funding causing
Presswood to suffer financial hardship.  The plaintiff appointed a Receiver to
Presswood and subsequently
sold its businesses.  The plaintiff's representative
resigned from the Board of Presswood.  In so doing the plaintiff caused
Presswood
to be in a position where it was unable to pay its debts.  The
plaintiff seeks to recover the debts of Presswood from Windermere
following
breach of the plaintiff's fiduciary duty to Presswood.  The defendant has a
valid and legitimate issue to be tried."</b>
<P>

Although I only admitted most of paragraph 8 on the basis that it contained
assertions, a number of these matters were established
by other evidence or
conceded as being true on the pleadings and, of course, only for present
purposes.
<P>

<b>The Terms Of The Mortgages</b>
<P>

28   	Mr Bell submitted that the mortgages, on their proper
construction, did not permit the defendant to rely upon either a cross-claim
or
an equitable set-off, which may be available to the debtor, in answer to the
claims by the plaintiff.  He referred to the provisions
in the mortgage of 18
March 1992, particularly arising from the memorandum incorporated in it, which
provided that the defendant
was liable for all moneys payable by the debtor
whether as principal or surety; and, in particular, for all moneys the
plaintiff
lent, paid or became liable to lend or pay or may have advanced or
may advance to the debtor.  He relied in particular upon clauses
24 and 25 of
the memorandum, which provide:-
<P>

<b>"24.	As a separate and independent stipulation the mortgagor hereby agrees
and declares that all or any sums of money which may not
be recoverable from
the mortgagor on the footing of a guarantee whether by reason of any legal
limitation disability or incapacity
on or of the debtor or any other mortgagor
if there are more than one <u>or any other fact or circumstance</u> and whether
known to the Bank or not shall nevertheless be recoverable from the mortgagor
<u>as sole or principal debtor</u> in respect thereof and shall be paid by the
mortgagor on demand together with interest at the rate or rates charged or
chargeable
by the Bank in respect of the moneys hereby secured immediately
prior to the making of such demand from the date of demand until
payment.</b>
<P>

<b>  25.	The Bank is under no obligation to hold or take any other or further
security or guarantee for the payment of the moneys hereby
secured and this
mortgage shall be in addition to and independent of and shall not affect or be
affected by any other or further
security or guarantee now or hereafter held or
taken by the Bank or by any arrangement or transaction between the Bank and the
debtor
or any other person or by any loss release discharge abandonment or
transfer either in whole or in part and either with or without
consideration of
any other security or guarantee now or hereafter held by the Bank from the
debtor or from any other person or by
any act forbearance or omission by the
Bank<u> or by any other act matter or thing whereby the mortgagor if surety for
the debtor might be released or discharged from liability
under these
presents</u>."   </b>(My emphasis.)
<P>

29   	The memorandum incorporated in the mortgage of 15 July
1992 contained similar provisions and, in clause 9.6, provided that
as a
separate and independent stipulation the defendant agreed and declared that all
or any money which may not be recoverable from
it on the footing of a guarantee
for various reasons was, nevertheless, recoverable from it as sole or principal
debtor.  Clause
9.7 stated that the plaintiff was under no obligation to take
any further or other security or guarantee nor, under clause 9.8, to
resort to
any which it may have taken.
<P>

<b>The Submissions On Behalf Of The Plaintiff</b>
<P>

30   	Mr Bell submitted that the defendant cannot rely upon
damages arising from breaches of fiduciary duty owed to the debtor either
as an
equitable set-off against its obligations to the plaintiff under the mortgages,
or by way of cross-claim; and that reliance
could not be placed upon
allegations that implied and/or express terms of the mortgages were breached;
nor upon an allegation that
the mortgages are harsh and unconscionable.  His
submissions continued that the terms of the mortgages do not permit the
defendant
to raise such defences and cross-claims available to the debtor,
which position would not be cured by the joinder of the debtor as
a defendant.
He relied on the provisions of the mortgages and what he described as a line of
authority commencing with <b>Cellulose Products Pty Limited v Truda &amp;
Ors</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%2092%20WN%20561" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 92 WN 561.</a>  In my opinion, there is no consistency in the
various decisions to which he referred.
<P>

31   	In <b>Cellulose Products</b> the directors of a purchaser
company guaranteed its obligations to a vendor to it of certain goods and, in
response to a claim by
the vendor against them, raised breaches by the
plaintiff vendor of warranties given to the purchaser company pursuant to the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soga128/" class="autolink_findacts">Sale of Goods Act</a></b> 1923.  The plaintiff sought an order striking out
these pleadings "as being clearly demurrable".  Two of the defendants sought
leave
to file additional pleas by way of cross-action at common law claiming
damages for breach of warranties, and defences of set-off
or cross-action on
equitable grounds claiming breaches of warranty in various terms.  It was held
that a surety cannot defend an
action on a guarantee by claiming by way of
set-off or cross-action, whether at common law or in equity, unliquidated
damages resulting
either from a breach of contract between the principal debtor
and the creditor, or arising out of any other claim for unliquidated
damages
which the principal debtor may have against the creditor.
<P>

32   	Much of the judgment in that case, as one would
anticipate, was directed to the precise point in issue, namely the rights
a
party has in respect of a breach of warranty under that Act and the true
characterisation of damages under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soga128/s54.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.54</a> of it.  Isaacs J drew together his
conclusions on these points at pp.570-571.  He referred to certain American
authorities and, at
p.577, dealt with a "set-off", which he defined as one in
respect of a claim for a liquidated sum arising out of the same transaction,
the claim of the plaintiff being also for a liquidated sum.
<P>

33   	His Honour came to the view, p.585, that a certain passage
in <b>Halsbury</b> was not authority for the statement in the text.  He
distinguished the position on the following bases:-
<P>

<b>"In the first place, all the parties were before the Court, so that if the
surety did have a right of exoneration by the principal,
that right was able to
be enforced in the proceedings.  Secondly, the liquidation of the company
raised a special equity because,
as is seen from the last portion of the
judgment of Stirling J, if the course there taken was not followed the
contractors might
recover fully against the trustee company (guarantor) and the
latter could only prove in the liquidation for a dividend.  This and
similar
cases which deal with a state of affairs where a debtor is insolvent, are of no
value or assistance, except perhaps to demonstrate
that such cases are
exceptions to the general rule that a guarantor cannot avail himself of the
remedies which otherwise may be open
to the principal debtor as against the
creditor.  Thirdly, it will be recalled that there were special circumstances
in <i>Bechervais v Lewis</i> which required a particular sum to be taken into
account.  The debtor had, as previously stated, purchased certain debts due to
the
creditor and the purchase price was guaranteed by the defendant in the
action.  The arrangement between the creditor and debtor was
that the creditor
was to collect the debts, although the purchaser had paid for them, and that
prior to the action being brought
by the creditor against the guarantor, the
creditor had actually collected some of the debts, but nevertheless failed to
give the
debtor credit for them and sued the guarantor for the full amount.  In
these circumstances it may be correct to say, as did Stirling
J, `in that
particular case the set-off arose out of the same transaction as that out of
which the suretyship arose', but as I have
already pointed out, this case is
merely illustrative of the general rule that the surety when sued can always
show that the amount
of the debt for which he is sued has been in fact reduced
by the principal debtor, either by a direct payment or by receipt of moneys
by
the creditor on the debtor's account and for which the debtor is entitled to be
credited."</b>
<P>

I refer to this part of his Honour's judgment to show his recognition that in
circumstances other than those before him, the situation
may be different.
<P>

34   	The facts of the present case are, of course, far removed
from those with which Isaacs J was concerned.
<P>

35   	In <b>Langford Concrete Pty Limited v Finlay</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1978%5d%201%20NSWLR%2014" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1978] 1
NSWLR 14</a> a director of a company guaranteed its performance of a contract into
which the company entered for the supply of concrete from the
plaintiff.  The
company went into liquidation and the plaintiff sued the guarantor and
recovered judgment by default in the District
Court.  An application to set
aside the judgment and for leave to defend was refused on the basis that the
appellant did not have
an arguable defence, and reliance was placed upon
<b>Cellulose Products</b> at first instance.
<P>

36   	The Court of Appeal was of the view that the application
to the District Court was in an unsatisfactory state, there being
no precise
formulation of the defences, nor evidence of the terms of the contract between
the debtor and the respondent.
<P>

37   	The Court of Appeal dealt with the matter on the basis
that it had to be satisfied that the appellant was, as a matter of
law,
entitled to have the cross-claim, which could have been brought by the debtor,
raised before he could be let in to defend. 
Their Honours noted that the
substantial issue in the appeal was whether a guarantor could take advantage of
the reduction in the
price to be paid by the debtor by reason of defective
work, it being clear that the debtor could have set up the defective work in
diminution of the contract price.  Their Honours were of the view that not
every type of cross-claim can be utilised to diminish
a debt connected with the
same transaction.  Further, they were concerned with whether the terms of the
guarantee allowed the guarantor
to assert that he was only obliged to pay the
amount payable by the debtor, and they concluded that it was not a guarantee to
pay
the price, or the price without deduction, but to pay only what the debtor
could have been compelled to pay.
<P>

38   	As I understand it their Honours, in having regard to the
case before them, did not accept all of the reasoning in <b>Cellulose</b>.
And, at p.18, they said:-
<P>

<b>"No cross-claim or set-off can directly reduce the debt concerned and, if
the principle were rigidly adhered to, it would mean that,
in no case, could a
guarantor take advantage of a set-off or cross-claim, except where the debtor
is before the Court.  This is not
consistent with authority: see <i>Murphy v
Glass</i> a decision of the Privy Council on appeal from the Supreme Court of
Victoria.  It does, therefore, appear that the rigidity of principle
has been
adjusted on certain occasions to remit the litigation of these issues without
the presence of all parties concerned."</b>
<P>

39   	They turned to consider a suggested exception where the
debtor is insolvent and, at p.19, rejected it stating:-
<P>

<b>"The principle that the guarantor should not be allowed to raise a defence
by way of cross-action, unless the debtor is a party, is
one for the benefit of
the creditor; and this principle can be of no practical benefit to him where
the debtor is in liquidation
or insolvent.  If he wishes to have the debtor
bound, he is equally able to have it joined in the proceedings.  Despite the
theoretical
difficulties involved, it seems to us that the guarantor should be
allowed to raise this defence, and that the appeal should be allowed."</b>
<P>

Once again it is necessary to take the case in the context of the issues before
the Court and having regard to the submissions made.
 However, there is
sufficient there, in my respectful opinion, to suggest the absence of any
absolute rule.
<P>

40   	In <b>Covino &amp; Anor v Bandag Manufacturing Pty
Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1983%5d%201%20NSWLR%20237" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1983] 1 NSWLR 237</a> it was held that a guarantor, under a guarantee
which made him liable without more for the full indebtedness of the debtor for
goods
supplied, could not rely on a cross-claim for damages which may be
available to the debtor as against the creditor in reduction of
his liability
under the guarantee, nor could he raise as a defence to his indebtedness a
cross-claim for damages available to the
debtor as against the creditor.
<b>Cellulose</b> was followed expressly by Glass JA, although it was not
considered by Hutley and Mahoney JJA.
<P>

41   	In that case, notwithstanding the finding, Hutley JA, at
p.238, said:-
<P>

<b>"Where it is necessary to rely upon a true set-off or cross-claim to
diminish a debt, it only operates so to do upon judgment.  The
legal position
resulting from the repeal of the Statutes of Set-off in this State was analysed
in this Court in <i>Stehar Knitting Mills Pty Limited v Southern Textile
Converters Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20NSWLR%20514" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 2 NSWLR 514.</a>  Except in cases of equitable
set-off, set-off and cross-claim do not extinguish debts until converted into
judgments in proceedings
in which they are pleaded as such."</b>
<P>

Subsequently his Honour said that any basis for an equitable counter-claim must
go to the root of the plaintiff's title.
<P>

42   	Glass JA was of the view that the matter was covered by
the decision in <b>Cellulose</b>.  Mahoney JA considered that the orders made
at first instance were of a discretionary nature, as undoubtedly they were, and
that
whether or not the guarantors would have been entitled to set up the
cross-claim, had they done so in the ordinary course of pleading,
was not to
the point, the question being whether the discretion had been exercised
properly.
<P>

43   	It cannot, in my respectful opinion, be said that there
was a conclusive statement that reliance could not be placed on at
least an
equitable set-off provided it was pleaded in a timely fashion.
<P>

44   	In <b>Indrisie v General Credits Limited</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1985/20.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] VicRp 20</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%20VR%20251" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1985] VR 251</a>
the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria was concerned with the position
of a guarantor under a guarantee, which made him
liable "without more for the
full indebtedness of the debtor".  It held that the guarantor could not rely
upon a cross-claim for
damages which may have been available to the principal
debtor as against the creditor in reduction of, or as a defence to, his
liability
under the guarantee.  Reliance was placed upon <b>Cellulose</b> and
<b>Covino</b>.  The Court also held that to rely upon a cross-claim as an
equitable set-off necessitated such a nexus between the claim and the
cross-claim that the latter could be said to impeach the plaintiff's claim, and
that such a cross-claim could be availed of only
by the cross-claimant himself
and not by the guarantor.  This was a succinct judgment of the Court, which
followed <b>Covino</b> in so far as <b>Covino</b> relied upon <b>Cellulose</b>,
held that the right to an equitable set-off depended on the matters to which I
have referred, and stated that a formidable obstacle
was that any right to an
equitable set-off would vest in the principal debtor and not the guarantors.
Their Honours continued, p.254:-
<P>

<b>"There is no authority to which the Court was referred in which there was
acknowledged the right to any such transference of an alien
claim to meet an
obligation by way of equitable set-off.  Nor, in our opinion, should the Court
as a matter of principle now take
the step hitherto not taken of extending to a
stranger to the cross-claim any right that properly should be that of the
cross-claimant
alone.  In any event for such a step to be taken the company
would have to be before the Court as a party: see <i>Wilson v Mitchell</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1939%5d%202%20KB%20869" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1939] 2 KB 869."</a></b>
<P>

45   	It does not appear that their Honours were referred to the
Court of Appeal's decision in <b>Langford Concrete</b>, which, as I have said,
held that <b>Wilson v Mitchell</b>, or at least the dictum in it, did not deal
with the case of an insolvent co-surety.  Their Honours said this in
<b>Langford Concrete</b> in the context that it appeared that the rigidity of
the principle requiring the debtor to be before the Court had been adjusted
on
certain occasions to permit the litigation of issues without the presence of
all parties concerned.
<P>

46   	In <b>Re Kleiss &amp; Anor ex parte Kleiss &amp; Anor v
Capt'n Snooze Pty Limited</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2061%20FCR%20436" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 61 FCR 436</a> debtors filed an application
seeking to set aside a bankruptcy notice on the basis of a set-off or
cross-demand of the type referred
to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/soga128/s40.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.40(1)(g)</a> of the <b>Bankruptcy Act</b>
1966.  
<P>

47   	At p.438 Drummond J posed the question:-
<P>

<b>"Can a guarantor rely on a set-off available to the principal
debtor?"</b>
<P>

His Honour said:-
<P>

<b>"This point is of relevance only to the Kleiss' case that they can, in
defending the creditor's claim on the guarantee, rely on an
answer to the
creditor's claim available to the principal debtor: it is of no relevance to
the Kleiss' claim to have the guarantee
set aside.  I do not regard the
authorities relied on by Capt'n Snooze as establishing the existence of a
general rule that a guarantor
is, as a matter of legal principle, not entitled
to rely on a set-off available to the principal debtor to answer a claim on a
guarantee.
 </b>
<P>

<b>I have already set out the relevant provisions of the guarantee.  It is not
a guarantee which would, as a matter of construction,
deny the guarantors'
entitlement to rely on a set-off available to the principal debtor against a
demand made by the creditor on
it, in answer to a demand made on the
guarantee."</b>
<P>

48   	In considering <b>Covino</b> his Honour said:-
<P>

<b>"Two members of the Court did not dispute that (in the absence of something
in the wording of the guarantee preventing it) an equitable
set-off available
to the principal debtor could be relied on by the guarantor, at least if the
debtor was joined as a party in the
action between creditor and
guarantor."</b>
<P>

49   	In considering <b>Indrisie</b> his Honour noted that the
Full Court's approval of <b>Covino</b> was confined to the judgment of Glass
JA.  His Honour continued, pp.439-440:-
<P>

<b>"I do not regard <i>Indrisie v General Credits Limited</i>, as an authority
that a guarantor can never rely on an equitable set-off available to the
principal debtor to meet a claim by Capt'n
Snooze on a guarantee."</b>
<P>

50   	His Honour then referred to the decision in <b>Australia
and New Zealand Banking Group Limited v Harvey</b> [1994] ATPR 53640.  In that
case Cox J was concerned with a number of issues, including a defence by way of
equitable set-off.  His
Honour, at p.53643, said:-
<P>

<b>"An equitable set-off may be available to a defendant where <u>he</u> has a
cross-demand against the plaintiff.  The Statutes of Set-off were confined to
mutual debts but equitable set-off may be available
notwithstanding that one of
the demands is for unliquidated damages (<i>Derham, Recent Issues in Relation
to Set-Off</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2068%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20331" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 68 ALJ 331</a> at 332 and see also the authorities gathered
by Crawford by in <i>Zeecap (No 47) Pty Limited v Anitam Pty Limited v
Foster</i> 26/1989).  However, for there to be an equitable set-off,
cross-demands must be between the same parties."   </b>(His Honour's
emphasis.)
<P>

Cox J set forth the terms of the mortgage.  He considered that based upon
<b>Cellulose </b>and <b>Indrisie</b> the mortgage, on its proper construction,
made provision for the payment of the full indebtedness, and, therefore,
precluded a set-off.
<P>

51   	Drummond J noted this point and then considered
<b>Langford</b>.  He said, p.440:-
<P>

<b>"This decision is authority that, provided the wording of the guarantee is
such as to permit the guarantor to answer a claim on the
guarantee by raising a
set-off or cross-claim available to the principal debtor against the creditor,
that course is open to the
guarantor; but the principal debtor must be joined
in the proceedings between creditor and guarantor, unless that is unnecessary
e.g. because of the principal debtor's insolvency.  There is a substantial body
of authority, including authority of considerable
antiquity, to the effect that
it is a consequence of the guarantor's entitlement to be exonerated by the
principal debtor that he
can rely on an equitable set-off available to the
principal debtor against the creditor in answering the creditor's demand on the
guarantee ..</b>
<P>

<b>In my opinion, on the authority of <i>Langford Concrete Pty Limited v
Finlay</i> and quite apart from the consequences that flow from a guarantor's
right of exoneration by the principal debtor, since the Kleisses
here, on the
true construction of their guarantee, only promise to guarantee the due payment
of all moneys by Sheracove, they were
entitled to rely upon an equitable
set-off available to Sheracove, as against Capt'n Snooze, in answer to a demand
made by Capt'n
Snooze on them as guarantors."</b>
<P>

<b>Conclusions From The Authorities On Which The Plaintiff Relied</b>
<P>

52   	In considering the memorandum incorporated in the mortgage
of 18 March 1992 I do not think0 it is possible, at least at this
stage, to say
that the Court must find that the extent of the guarantee is to all moneys
"without deduction".  In Part A reference
is made to all moneys, which may
become payable in the circumstances stated.  However this does not mean, as a
matter of construction,
that the issue as to the amount payable is foreclosed
to the debtor.  This is somewhat highlighted by clause E17, which makes a
statement
in writing "prima facie evidence" only of an amount owing, therefore
allowing the defendant to challenge the amount claimed, presumably
on any
available grounds.  Many such clauses provide that the certificate shall be
"conclusive" evidence, which would be more consistent
with the stance that the
defendant is obliged to pay the amount certified without deduction.
<P>

53   	Clause E24, which I have cited, does not exclude sums
which may not be recoverable on the footing that the principal debtor
has a
cross-claim, unless the words "or any other fact or circumstance" give rise to
that conclusion.  That raises a question as
to whether those words should be
read <i>ejusdem generis</i> with the words "legal limitation disability or
incapacity" and, if they should not, how they are to be reconciled with the
provisions
that the amount recoverable is the amount payable by the debtor,
which, prima facie, is the amount properly so payable and without
deduction.
<P>

54   	Similarly in the memorandum incorporated in the mortgage
of 15 July 1992 the all moneys clause is in essentially the same
terms, and
clause 7.12 makes a statement in writing prima facie evidence only of the
amount owing.
<P>

55   	Clause 7.2 makes the "Secured Moneys" immediately payable,
and clause 7.3 gives the plaintiff the power to set-off.  If that
were to occur
the guarantor, at least arguably, should be able to take advantage of it.
<P>

56   	Clause 9.6 is in the same, or essentially the same, terms
as clause E24.  Once again it is to be noted that there is no provision
in that
clause for the recovery "without deduction".  Further, those clauses are
directed to moneys which may not be recoverable
from the debtor, rather than to
the right of the debtor to set-off moneys against the former moneys.
<P>

57   	Clause 25, which I have quoted, and its counterpart in the
second Memorandum are arguably referring to circumstances entitling
the
defendant, as in effect a surety, to avoid its obligations as such.  The clause
seeks to prevent that.  But the clause does not
point inevitably to the
enforceability of the mortgages for all amounts said to be owing without
deduction.  This is particularly
so when the clauses are read with all the
terms of the mortgages.  In the result I am not satisfied that the proper
interpretation
of the mortgages necessarily leads to the conclusions for which
Mr Bell contended, nor, in any event, that that would be the situation
if an
equitable set-off or a claim for damages for breach of fiduciary duty is
available in the circumstances of this case.
<P>

<b>Equitable Set-Off</b>
<P>

58   	In <b>AWA Limited v Exicom Australia Pty Limited</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2019%20NSWLR%20705" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 19 NSWLR 705</a> Giles J gave a wider operation to an equitable set-off or
equitable defence.  His Honour made clear that in each case one must look
at
the particular facts to determine whether it would be unjust or inequitable for
the plaintiff to be permitted to proceed with
its claim without making
allowance for the cross-demand and, in doing that, all the circumstances of the
case must be considered.
 His Honour came to a similar decision in <b>Murphy
&amp; Anor v Zamonex Pty Limited &amp; Ors</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2031%20NSWLR%20439" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 31 NSWLR 439</a>, stating, at
p.465:-
<P>

<b>"Equitable set-off is available where the defendant establishes an equitable
ground for being protected from the plaintiff's claim.
 That has been expressed
in language to the effect that the defendant's set-off goes to the root of or
impeaches the title of the
plaintiff's claim, but also in language to the
effect that the counter-claim is so directly connected with the claim that it
would
be unjust to allow the plaintiff to recover without taking into account
the defendant's counter-claim.  It is sufficient to refer
to <i>AWA </i>..,
<i>James v Commonwealth Bank of Australia</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/420.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCA 420</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2037%20FCR%20445" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 37 FCR 445</a> .. and the
discussion in <i>Meagher, Gummow &amp; Lehane</i>, paras 3709-3710 at 817-823,
without going into whether the latter approach is an illicit departure from
principle and authority."</b>
<P>

59   	The issues concerning equitable set-off have since been
considered in <b>Direct Acceptance Corporation Limited (In Liquidation) v
Lord</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2031%20NSWLR%20439" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 31 NSWLR 439</a> and, on appeal,  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2032%20NSWLR%20362" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 32 NSWLR 362</a>, and by me in
<b>Coles Myer Limited v Liverpool Growers (Australasia) Pty Limited</b> (24
September 1993 - unreported); <b>Westpac Banking Corporation v Nalty</b> (8
October 1993 - unreported); and <b>Algons Engineering Pty Limited v Abigroup
Contractors Pty Limited</b> (1 August 1997 - unreported).  All these decisions
make clear that the Court must look at the particular circumstances of each
case.
 This may mean that the ultimate question as to the right to a set-off
may not depend on the construction of the security document
alone.
<P>

60   	In <b>Tooth &amp; Co Limited v Rosier</b> (Wood J - 7 June
1985 - unreported) there was an application for summary judgment.  In the
course of considering it his Honour dealt
with a defence of set-off, considered
cases such as <b>Cellulose</b>, <b>Langford</b> and <b>Covino</b>, and
said:-
<P>

<b>"That the ultimate question might not always turn on the construction of the
guarantee alone, is however suggested by the passages
in the judgments of
Isaacs J in <i>Cellulose Products</i>, and of Hutley JA in <i>Covino</i>, to
which reference has been made."</b>
<P>

His Honour cited from the decision of Clarke J in <b>Tooth &amp; Company
Limited v Smith</b> (5 September 1984 - unreported), where his Honour, in
considering the circumstances in which an equitable set-off may arise,
said:-
<P>

<b>"No general rule can be laid down except by stating that such a set-off will
arise when there exists circumstances which make it unjust
or inequitable that
a plaintiff should be permitted to proceed with his claim."</b>
<P>

Wood J continued:-
<P>

<b>"As presently advised, I do not see any fault in this test.  No doubt where
an equitable counter-claim was pleaded the fact that the
transactions concerned
were separate will always be a powerful consideration.  However, at this stage
of the proceedings, I am not
clearly satisfied that the facts alleged would not
give rise to an equitable defence."</b>
<P>

<b>The Position In The Present Case</b>
<P>

61   	The present case introduces facts of some novelty, in the
sense that there is the close inter-relationship, at a financial
level, between
the plaintiff, the defendant and the debtor, which enabled the plaintiff to
have and exercise substantial financial
control over the affairs of the debtor
by virtue of the Deed made on 18 March 1992 and thus, one may infer,
simultaneously with the
first mortgage and prior to the second mortgage.  The
relationship between the parties i.e. the plaintiff and the debtor, therefore,
at least arguably, gave rise to a situation from which the causes of action
raised by the cross-claim could come about in circumstances
giving rise to an
equitable set-off.  The further questions are then whether that is a claim of
which the defendant can take advantage
in circumstances where the reasonable
inference is that the debtor is either in real financial difficulty or
insolvent, and, if it
can, whether there is any provision in the security
documents precluding its doing so.
<P>

62   	When all these matters are considered in the light of the
principles governing summary judgment applications, it seems to
me that it is
not possible to say that the defendant's case is not one where there is not a
real question to be determined upon which
the rights of the parties depend, nor
that it is one which is "so obviously untenable that it cannot possibly
succeed", nor "manifestly
groundless", nor one disclosing "no real question to
be tried".  It is a case, to use the words in <b>Webster v Lampard</b>, at
p.611, where the material before me is "clearly not such as to justify a
finding that the proceedings against ... are `hopeless'
in that they will
inevitably fail if allowed to proceed to trial in the ordinary course".  Nor is
it a case, as I have sought to
show, where the interpretation of the mortgage,
necessarily, leads to the conclusion that an equitable set-off or cross-claim
is
precluded.
<P>

63   	Mr Bell submitted that if I was minded to allow the matter
to proceed on the grounds of equitable set-off or cross-claim arising
from the
breach of a fiduciary duty, I should, none-the-less, hold that no cause of
action had been disclosed in respect of the breach
of any terms of the
mortgages or on the ground that the entry into the mortgages was harsh and
unconscionable.  I am not satisfied
that there is no such basis shown.
However, it seems to me that once it is established that there is a viable
ground on the basis
of which the proceedings may go forward, the proper
approach is to permit all matters to go to trial: <b>Wickstead &amp; Ors v
Browne</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2030%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 30 NSWLR 1.</a>  I appreciate that in that case there were
undoubtedly good causes of action, but, as a matter of principle, I do not see
why that
should not be extended when a matter is to proceed.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

64   	In my opinion the plaintiff's Notice of Motion, to the
extent that it seeks orders that the Defence and Cross-Claim dated
3 February
1999 be struck out and for summary judgment, must be dismissed with costs.  I
propose to make that order and to stand
the balance of the Notice of Motion
over until Friday, 4 June 1999.  My present inclination is to order that the
proceedings be transferred
to the Commercial List of the Equity Division and to
seek to have the matter heard as soon as possible.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

65   	I order that:-
<P>

1.	The plaintiff's Notice of Motion in so far as it seeks orders that the
defendant's Defence and Cross-Claim dated 3 February 1999
be struck out and for
summary judgment be dismissed.
<P>

2.	The plaintiff pay the defendant's costs of the Notice of Motion to date.
<P>

3.	Matter stood over to 4 June 1999 for directions.
<P>

4.	Exhibits be returned.
