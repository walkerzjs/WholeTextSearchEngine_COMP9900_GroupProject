030084/98	<b>STATE RAIL AUTHORITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES   v   NEIL WARREN JOHNSTON
&amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR : The plaintiff, State Rail Authority, has brought proceedings in
this Court by way of summons and seeks to restrain
the second defendant, the
Consumer Claims Tribunal, from entertaining a claim by the first defendant,
Neil Johnston.
<P>

2	The second defendant filed a submitting appearance. The first defendant was
represented by Mr Conomy of counsel, to oppose any
order for costs against the
first defendant.  Mr Conomy informed the Court that the first defendant did not
otherwise wish to be
heard and was excused from further appearance.
<P>

3	On 3 October 1997 the first defendant was issued with an infringement notice
for travelling without a valid ticket, having joined
the train at Central
railway station at 5.15 am with the intention of travelling in it to Awaba.
The first defendant acknowledged
that he was apprehended whilst without a
ticket, but complained that he had been unable to find a ticket outlet before
joining the
train.  In his representation by letter to the plaintiff of 10
October 1997 he complained that he offered to pay the fare to the
officer who
issued the notice but this offer was rejected.  On 24 November 1997 the
plaintiff wrote to the first defendant advising
that the payment of the penalty
for travelling without a ticket was being pursued and the first defendant was
allowed twenty-one
days to pay.
<P>

4	What next occurred was that the first defendant lodged a claim in the
Consumer Claims Tribunal on 22 December 1997, naming State
Rail as respondent,
and seeking <i>"opportunity to purchase a ticket"</i>, presumably for the
journey in the previous October.
<P>

5	The plaintiff challenged the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, expressing the
grounds of its challenge in the statutory declaration
of Mr David Gosling dated
20 March 1988 and the plaintiff requested the dismissal of the first
defendant's claim.
<P>

6	For reasons published on 13 July 1998 a referee ruled that he had
jurisdiction to entertain the first defendant's claim against
the plaintiff but
so far he has not proceeded to deal with the claim.
<P>

7	The plaintiff filed its summons in this matter on 25 August 1998 and on the
hearing before me relied upon the following affidavit
evidence:
<P>

&#176;	the affidavit of David Gosling sworn 7 August 1998;
<P>

&#176;	the affidavit of Derek Hilliard sworn 3 September 1998.
<P>

8	The file of the Consumer Claims Tribunal which included the reasons of the
referee expressed pursuant to s 26 of the <i>Consumer Claims Tribunals Act</i>
was tendered and admitted into evidence.
<P>

9	Mr Connell, who appeared for the plaintiff, informed the Court that this was
the first occasion on which a person given an infringement
notice had sought to
pursue a claim in circumstances such as these in the Consumer Claims Tribunal.
Mr Connell presented extensive
written submissions arguing for the relief
sought in the summons, and I have derived considerable assistance from those
submissions.
<P>

10	Section 12 of the <i>Consumer Claims Tribunal Act</i>, 1987 affords the
opportunity for intervention by this Court where the Tribunal has made an
erroneous ruling as to its jurisdiction.
 The section provides:
<P>

	<i>"(1)	Except as provided by subsection (2), a court of record has no
jurisdiction to grant relief or a remedy by way of:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	a judgment or order in the nature of prohibition, mandamus, certiorari
or other prerogative writ,</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	a declaratory judgment or order, or</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	an injunction,</i>
<P>

<i>	in respect of a consumer claim heard and determined or to be heard or
determined by a tribunal in accordance with this Act or in
respect of any
ruling, order or other proceeding relating to such a claim.</i>
<P>

<i>	(2)	A court is not precluded from granting relief or a remedy of a kind
referred to in subsection (1) if, in respect of a consumer
claim:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	a tribunal has given a ruling under section 26 or refused or failed to
give such a ruling after the jurisdiction of the tribunal
to hear and determine
the claim has been disputed by a party to the claim and the ground on which the
relief or remedy is sought
is that:</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	the ruling was erroneous, or</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	the tribunal erred in refusing or failing to give the ruling after its
jurisdiction was disputed..."</i>
<P>

11	It is submitted that s 12(2)(a)(i) applies in the circumstances of this
case.  The jurisdiction of the Tribunal was challenged
and the referee gave his
ruling as to jurisdiction under s 26 of the statute.  It is submitted that that
ruling was erroneous.
<P>

12	Clause 6 of a regulation pursuant to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1988305/" class="autolink_findacts">Transport Administration Act</a>
</i>provides:
<P>

	<i>"6.  (1)  A person must not travel on a train without holding a valid
ticket for the travel concerned."</i>
<P>

13	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1988305/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 117</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1988305/" class="autolink_findacts">Transport Administration Act</a></i> makes provision for
the issue of a penalty notice such as was issued to the first defendant, and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1988305/s118.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
118</a> makes provision for proceedings in the event of non-payment of the penalty
prescribed in the notice.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1988305/s118.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 118</a> provides:
<P>

	<i>"Proceedings for an offence against this Act or the regulations shall be
dealt with summarily before a Local Court constituted by
a Magistrate sitting
alone."</i>
<P>

14	It is plain by reference to the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1988305/" class="autolink_findacts">Transport Administration Act</a></i> that the
Local Court is the appropriate tribunal to entertain proceedings for an offence
such as that which it is alleged that the
first defendant committed on 3
October 1997.
<P>

15	Section 11 of the <i>Consumer Claims Tribunals Act</i> excludes the
jurisdiction of "courts" in certain cases, where a consumer claim has been
lodged under the Act, but the section has
no application to proceedings to be
taken in the Local Court under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1988305/s118.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 118</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1988305/" class="autolink_findacts">Transport Administration
Act</a></i>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1988305/s11.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 11</a> would not inhibit proceedings against the first defendant
for travelling without a valid ticket, since such proceedings would be
taken in
the Local Court <i>"empowered by law to impose a penalty...for a contravention
of the law."  </i>Hence by operation of s 11(1)(c) of the <i>Consumers Claims
Tribunals Act</i> that section would not operate to interfere with the
jurisdiction of the Local Court.
<P>

16	The referee's finding that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear and
determine the claim of the first defendant calls for examination
of the
<i>Consumer Claims Tribunals Act</i>.
<P>

17	Under s 10 a Tribunal constituted under the Act "has jurisdiction to hear
and determine any consumer claim referred to it in
accordance with this
Act.'
<P>

18	<i>"Consumer claim"</i> is defined in s 3 as meaning:
<P>

	<i>"(a)	a claim by a consumer for the payment of a specified sum of
money,</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	a claim by a consumer for the supply of specified services,</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	a claim by a consumer for relief from payment of a specified sum of
money,</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	a claim by a consumer for the delivery, return or replacement of
specified goods or goods of a specified description, or</i>
<P>

<i>	(e)	a claim by a consumer for a combination of 2 or more of the remedies
referred to in paragraphs (a)-(d),</i>
<P>

<i>	that arises from a supply of goods or services by a supplier to the
consumer, whether under a contract or not, or that arises under
a contract that
is collateral to a contract for the supply of goods or services."</i>
<P>

19	According to his stated reasons the referee appears to have decided that the
first defendant's claim was a claim for the supply
of specified services.
<i>"Supply"</i> is defined in s 3 as follows:
<P>

	<i>"(a)	in relation to goods, includes supply goods by way of a contract for
the sale, exchange, lease, hire or hire-purchase of goods
or an alleged
contract for the sale, exchange, lease, hire or hire-purchase of goods,
and</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	in relation to services, includes provide, grant or render services for
valuable consideration under a contract or for valuable
consideration claimed
to have been agreed to under an alleged contract."</i>
<P>

20	<i>"Supplier"</i> is stated in the same section as meaning:
<P>

	<i>"a person who, in the course of carrying on, or purporting to carry on, a
business, supplies goods or services."</i>
<P>

21	<i>"Services"</i> is defined in s 3 as follows:
<P>

	<i>"services includes any rights (including rights in relation to, and
interests in, property) benefits, privileges or facilities that
are, or are to
be, provided, granted or conferred in trade or commerce and, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, includes:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	the performance of work (including work of a professional nature),
whether with or without the supply of goods,</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	the provision of gas or electricity or the provision of any other form
of energy,</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	the provision, or the making available for use, of facilities for
amusement, entertainment, recreation or instruction, </i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	the letting of premises for vacation or recreational purposes,</i>
<P>

<i>	(e)	the conferring of rights, benefits or privileges for which remuneration
is payable in the form of a royalty, tribute, levy or
similar exaction,</i>
<P>

<i>	(f)	the provision of insurance cover (but not assurance cover in respect of
a person's life),</i>
<P>

<i>	(g)	a contract between a banker and a customer of the banker entered into
in the course of the carrying on by the banker of the business
of banking,
and</i>
<P>

<i>	(h)	subject to section 10(4), the provision of credit,</i>
<P>

<i>	but does not include rights or benefits being the supply of goods or the
performance of work under a contract of employment."</i>
<P>

22	What is the first defendant's claim for the supply of specified services?
His claim form lodged with the Tribunal seeks <i>"the opportunity to purchase a
ticket."</i>  Presumably what is sought is a ticket for the journey undertaken
on 3 October 1997.  However even if the plaintiff was ordered to
provide a
ticket now that would not affect the charge to be brought in the Local Court
which relates to his travelling without a
ticket on 3 October 1997.
<P>

23	In any event a claim to be issued a ticket is not a claim for the supply of
services, even allowing for the width of the statutory
definitions set out
above:  see <i>Employers Mutual Indemnity Association Ltd v Federal
Commissioner of Taxation</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1943/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1943] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281943%29%2068%20CLR%20165" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1943) 68 CLR 165</a> and in particular the judgment
of Latham CJ at 174 where the Chief Justice said:
<P>

	<i>"In my opinion the words `rendering of services to' persons mean doing work
of some kind for those persons.  When it is the primary
object of the company
to do work for other persons, then it may be said that the primary object of
the company is the rendering of
services to such persons.  But the issuing of
an insurance policy to a person of the type described is not doing work for
that person.
 It is making a contract with him.  Work may be done for a person
in business by a contract with him, but the making of a contract
with him does
not amount to doing work for him."</i>
<P>

24	See also <i>R v Small Claims Tribunal</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1981/60.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] VicRp 60</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20VR%20602" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) VR 602</a> and in particular
the judgment of Gobbo J at 606-607.
<P>

25	Nor could it otherwise be said that the claim of the first defendant arose
from the supply of services.  If the use that the
first defendant made of the
train on which he travelled was to be treated as arising from the supply of
transport services, that
occurred after the subject matter of the claim which
concerned the non provision of a ticket.
<P>

26	It is not in any event apt to describe what occurred as the supply of
services by the plaintiff to the first defendant.  In my
opinion Mr Connell is
correct in his analysis that what occurred was that the plaintiff simply joined
a train at Central railway
without a ticket and there was no supply in the
strict sense.  There was a use by the first defendant but there was no
deliberate
provision of a service by the plaintiff for the first defendant.
<P>

27	The jurisdiction of the Tribunal may be tested by posing the question as to
what relief it could give under s 30, which section
defines the orders that a
tribunal may make under the statute.  Under s 30 it may make one or more of the
following orders as it
considers appropriate:
<P>

	<i>"(1)	In determining a consumer claim wholly or partly in favour of a
claimant, a tribunal may, subject to sections 31 and 32, make
such one or more
of the following orders as it considers appropriate:</i>
<P>

<i>	(a)	an order that requires a respondent to pay to the claimant a specified
amount of money,</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	an order that requires a respondent to perform specified work in order
to rectify a defect in goods or services to which the
claim relates,</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	an order that requires a respondent to supply to the claimant specified
services other than work,</i>
<P>

<i>	(d)	in the case of a claim for relief from payment of money, an order
declaring that a specified amount of money is not due or owing
by the claimant
to a respondent,</i>
<P>

<i>	(e)	an order that requires a respondent to deliver to the claimant goods of
a specified description,</i>
<P>

<i>	(f)	an order that requires a respondent to return to the claimant specified
goods which are in the possession or under the control
of that respondent,
whether the property in the goods has passed or not,</i>
<P>

<i>	(g)	an order that requires a respondent to replace goods to which the claim
relates."</i>
<P>

28	In this case the referee does not appear to have applied his mind to the
relief he could give on the first defendant's claim.
 He said at p 5 of his
reasons:
<P>

	<i>"I agree that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1988305/s118.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 118</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1988305/" class="autolink_findacts">Transport Administration Act 1988</a> sets out
the mode of dealing with offences.  However, I am not in any way dealing with
an alleged `offence' nor am I entitled so
to do.</i>
<P>

<i>	In coming to that conclusion I do not consider the claimant's submission
concerning the application of subsection (5) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/taa1988305/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 117</a> really applies to
matter in the nature of a claim to the Consumer Claims Tribunal.</i>
<P>

<i>	I further agree that the Fines Act sets out the method of the annulment of
a penalty notice enforcement order.  I believe that hitherto
any attempt to
annul a penalty notice enforcement order and/or to have the original `alleged
offence' determined has traditionally
been dealt with in a local court.
However, in a claim lodged with this Tribunal I am not attempting to determine
the correctness
of the issuing of the penalty notice upon the claimant.</i>
<P>

<i>	I concede that if the claimant is ultimately successful in this claim
depending on the order - if any- that order may have some bearing
on the
criminal proceeding.  However, I do not consider I should deal with the aspect
of jurisdiction on the proposition of what
my final order - if any - could mean
in the future."</i>
<P>

29	In my opinion the referee could grant no appropriate relief of the type
contemplated in s 30(1) in this case.
<P>

30	Mr Connell referred to <i>Craig v South Australia </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20184%20CLR%20163" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 184 CLR 163</a> as
authority for the proposition that an inferior court falls into jurisdictional
error if it mistakenly asserts the existence of
jurisdiction or if it
misapprehends the nature of its functions or powers:  see in particular the
judgment of Brennan, Deane, Toohey,
Gaudron and McHugh JJ at 177. I am
persuaded by the submissions advanced by Mr Connell that there has been a
jurisdictional error
in the decision of the referee.
<P>

31	I conclude therefore that the plaintiff is entitled to relief under its
summons.
<P>

	<b>Formal orders</b>
<P>

32	1.	I make the declaration sought in paragraph 1 of the summons.
<P>

2.	I grant the injunction sought in paragraph 2 of the summons.
<P>

3.	I make the order sought in paragraph 3 of the summons.
<P>

4.	I make no order as to costs.
