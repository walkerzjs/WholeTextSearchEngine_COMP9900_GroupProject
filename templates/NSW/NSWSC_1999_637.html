<b>2961/98   -   RITA SALERNO  v  ALBERT PRICE -</b>
<P>

<b>ESTATE OF ROBERT PRICE</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b> These are proceedings under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act 1982</a>.  By summons filed on 26 June 1998, the plaintiff, Rita
Salerno, seeks an order for provision for her living expenses, education
and
advancement in life out of the estate of her late father, Robert Price (to whom
I shall refer as "the deceased").
<P>

2   	The deceased died on 17 February 1998, aged 75.  He left a
Will dated 8 December 1997, probate whereof was on 27 November 1998
granted to
Albert Price, the executor named in such Will (who is the defendant to the
present proceedings).
<P>

3   	 The plaintiff is the eldest of the three children of the
deceased.  She was born on 7 February 1953 in Italy and she is presently
aged
46.  The plaintiff and her parents came to Australia in 1961.  Two other
children were subsequently born to the deceased and
his wife.  They were two
sons, Frank and Albert.  Albert was born on 10 December 1971 and is presently
27 years of age.  The deceased
separated from his wife in about 1973.  Albert,
at that time, was a very small child.  He remained with his mother. However the
deceased
had access to him and they saw much of each other. Since about 1993,
Albert resided with the deceased.
<P>

4   	The plaintiff married on 8 March 1975.  Of her marriage
were born two children: a daughter Bianca, who is presently aged 22,
and a son
Matthew, who is presently aged 20.  The plaintiff separated from her husband
Albert Salerno in September 1994.  A year
later consent orders, by way of
property settlement, were made in the Family Court of Australia between the
plaintiff and her former
husband. At the time of her separation from her
husband, the plaintiff went to live with the deceased for a period of about
three
months, that being in the latter part of 1994. Thereafter the plaintiff,
who was at that time residing in Sydney, stayed intermittently
with the
deceased at his residence in Wollongong.
<P>

5   	The assets of the estate consist of a house property known
as 1A Strathern Avenue, Wollongong.  That house property consists
of two
self-contained dwellings in the form of a duplex.  The deceased and the
defendant resided together in the upper of those two
dwellings.  The lower, and
apparently much smaller, dwelling, was occasionally rented out by the deceased.
The parties have agreed
that the present value of the house property is
$210,000. 
<P>

6   	Apart from the house property, the other assets in the
estate of the deceased consist of money held with the Commonwealth Bank,
either
in an account or by way of a term deposit, totalling about $30,000, and the
contents of the house, various chattels, and several
dogs.  The defendant has
continued to reside in the property at 1A Strathern Avenue since the death of
his father.  The self-contained
lower flat is presently rented out for an
amount of $80 a week.
<P>

7   	 I have already observed that consent orders were made in
favour of the plaintiff in her proceedings in the Family Court of
Australia
with her former husband.  As a result of those consent orders, the plaintiff
received $400,000. With that money  she acquired
a house property at
Blakehurst, in which she resided, and an investment residential unit at
Lakemba.  At the end of 1998 the plaintiff
sold those two properties, and with
the proceeds of sale - being $260,000 less expenses in respect to the
Blakehurst house; and $106,000
less expenses in respect to the Lakemba unit-
she purchased her present residence, which is unit 2/45 Church Street,
Wollongong.
 The purchase price of that residential unit was $245,000.  When
legal fees, stamp duty and other associated expenses are taken into
account,
the acquisition of her present residence cost the plaintiff $253,672.
Apparently that is a new unit which had not previously
been occupied.  In
addition, the plaintiff owns a motor vehicle which is a 1993 model BMW motor
car, to which she has ascribed a
value of $24,000.  That motor vehicle came to
her as a result of the property settlement with her former husband.
<P>

8   	The plaintiff, whilst married, was essentially a homemaker
and mother, working for only a very short period during her married
life.
However, since her separation from her husband, the plaintiff has been in
almost continuous employment.  She was formerly working
in a kitchen capacity
with the Department of Juvenile Justice on a part time basis.  She is currently
employed as what is described
as a casual telemarketer in Wollongong, in which
position she receives $11 an hour before tax, and has been working an average
of
about ten hours a week.  She is also in receipt of partial unemployment
benefits being in the category of a Newstart allowance from
Centrelink.  That
allowance and   the plaintiff's wages total $284.57 a fortnight before tax.
<P>

9   	The plaintiff has, from the proceeds of sale of her two
pieces of real estate in Sydney, retained a balance of an amount in
excess of
$90,000, which has, however, been reduced to a present figure of $80,000, that
amount being invested in a Cash Management
Account with the Commonwealth Bank
of Australia.  The plaintiff redeemed an amount of $4,000 in January 1999, and
a further amount
of $9,000 in 1999 from the original sum invested.  Upon the
present investment of $80,000, the plaintiff receives interest which
she has
estimated to be about $3,200 a year.  For the financial year ended 30 June
1998, the plaintiff's taxable income was $37,098.
<P>

10   	The plaintiff's daughter, Bianca, who is presently aged
22, lives mainly with her father. However, she  intermittently stays
with the
plaintiff, who provides necessities for her.  Apparently Bianca is not in
employment and suffers from an epileptic condition.
<P>

11   	It was not disputed that there had been a close and
affectionate relationship between the plaintiff and the deceased.  There
was
placed in evidence an earlier Will which the deceased had made only six days
before the date of the Will which was admitted to
probate.  That earlier Will
gave a pecuniary legacy to each of the four grandchildren of the deceased.
There was a legacy of $5,000
to the two children of Frank.  Apparently those
children are infants of tender years.  There was a legacy of $10,000 each to
the
plaintiff's two children.  In that earlier Will the deceased then gave the
residue of his estate equally among his children.
<P>

12   	In the Will of 8 December 1997, the deceased gave the same
legacies to his four grandchildren.  He then gave the residue of
his estate to
his son Albert.  Clause 4 of the Will is in the following terms:
<P>

     I declare that it was the wish of my son Frank Price that I give property
to his children Natasha Price and Daniel Alexander
Price and not to him,
personally.
<P>

I make no provision for my daughter Rita Salerno directly for personal
reasons.
<P>

13   	The personal reasons, which are referred to in Clause 4 of
the Will, have not otherwise been identified.
<P>

14   	 It should be recognised that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> and
the discretion vested in the Court to make orders for provision, constitute a
qualification upon the general principle of freedom
of testamentary disposition
to which every person in this State is entitled.
<P>

15   	The plaintiff as a daughter of the deceased is an eligible
person within paragraph (a) of the definition of that phrase contained
in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>.  As such, she has the standing to
bring the present proceedings.  The defendant, as a son of the deceased, also
is an eligible person,
as is the other child of the deceased, Frank.  
<P>

16   	It is, however, at the outset, the responsibility of the
plaintiff to establish that she is entitled to an order for provision
out of
the estate of her late father.
<P>

17   	Orders for provision are not made to reward good services,
nor are they withheld in any way on account of what might be considered
as
shortcomings on the part of an applicant.  In the instant case, the plaintiff
is secure in her accommodation.  She has been in
regular employment for the
last four years.  She has a qualification as a cook Grade 1, having acquired
that qualification as a result
of a TAFE course.  She has a not inconsiderable
fund invested, to which she may resort in order to meet unexpected
contingencies
and which also provides her with an income additional to that
which she is capable of earning.  She has a relatively recent motor
vehicle of
a not inconsiderable value.
<P>

18   	I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has established any
relevant need.  That conclusion, of itself, is sufficient to dispose
of the
plaintiff's claim. Nevertheless, even if (contrary to that conclusion) the
plaintiff were to be regarded as having established
some relevant need, it
would be necessary for the Court to consider that claim in the light of any
competing claims upon the testamentary
bounty of the deceased.  
<P>

19   	 The only such competing claim is that of the defendant.
The other child of the deceased, Frank, has not made any claim against
his
father's estate.  It must be recognised that the defendant is the chosen object
of the testamentary beneficence of the deceased.
 It is not necessary for the
defendant to prove anything.  He does not have to establish anything.  The
relevance of his financial
and material circumstances is that they may have the
effect of reducing, or even extinguishing, any order for provision an
entitlement
to which the plaintiff might otherwise have established.
<P>

20   	 The defendant is 27 years of age.  He is a single man. He
lived with his father from the age of 20.  He continues to live
in the
residence occupied by his late father.  The defendant has qualified as a
carpenter.  He, however, has a preference to following
the career of a
fisherman.  He has worked for a period as a carpenter, but loves the work of a
fisherman and is employed as such
at the present time.  The defendant was
cross-examined to the effect that he could earn more as a carpenter than as a
fisherman.
 That may be so. But the defendant is entitled to work in whatever
occupation he chooses, and, as he rightly pointed out, he has
always been
employed and has never been on the dole.
<P>

21   	The defendant's present financial position is that he
receives an average of $350 a week from working six days a week as an
employed
fisherman.  That work, however, is seasonal, and depends upon the weather.  He
receives $80 a week from the rental of the
lower flat in the Strathern Avenue
residence.  The defendant owns a motor car which is 17 years old, to which he
ascribes the value
of $1,000; a boat and outboard motor valued at $3,500;
fishing equipment worth $500.  In addition, the defendant has the
responsibility
for three dogs, which apparently were owned by himself and his
father during his father's lifetime.  It emerges that the defendant
and the
deceased had a close and affectionate relationship.  They enjoyed common
interests in dogs and in fishing.
<P>

22   	Evidence has been placed before the Court by the
respective parties concerning the approximate costs of the present proceedings.
The costs of the defendant will, in any event, be paid out of the estate.  They
will total about $12,500.  Much of the balance of
the estate, apart from the
house property, will be expended in paying the defendant's costs and in paying
administration costs of
the estate and reimbursing the defendant for his
father's funeral expenses.  There will be little left in the estate, apart from
the house property.  
<P>

23   	 Any order for provision, an entitlement for which the
plaintiff might otherwise have established, will, of necessity, require
either
that the house property be sold, or that the defendant find some funds of his
own to meet that order for provision.  There
is no reason whatsoever why the
defendant should be forced to vacate his home. Neither do I see any reason why
- even  if he had
the financial capacity to do so - he should find funds from
his own pocket to meet any order for provision for the plaintiff.
<P>

24   	As I have already recorded, the plaintiff has not
established any relevant need, and that fact of itself is sufficient for
the
dismissal of her claim.  But even if she had established any relevant need, I
consider that the competing claim of the defendant
upon the bounty of his
father would have the consequence that any entitlement to an order for
provision which the plaintiff might
otherwise have established would be totally
extinguished.  In all the circumstances, I propose to dismiss the proceedings.
I make
the following orders:
<P>

25   	(1)	 I order that the summons be dismissed.
<P>

(2)	 I order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the defendant, such costs to
be on the party and party basis. 
<P>

The exhibit may be returned.
