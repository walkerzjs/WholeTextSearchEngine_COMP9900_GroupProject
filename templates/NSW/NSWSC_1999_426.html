WALES</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT (see p39 of the transcript)
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

1	In this matter the plaintiff has applied to file an amended reply.  The
history of pleading is that until a few days ago, there
was no reply filed in
these proceedings and no allegation of estoppel contained anywhere in the
pleadings.  On 1 April 1999 I granted
leave to the plaintiff to file a reply.
That reply, I am told, did not reach the defendant until 19 April, only a very
few days before
the commencement of the trial.  The reply, when it arrived, in
answer to the defence, made an allegation of estoppel based upon certain
of the
allegations in the amended points of claim.  The allegation was that the
defendant was estopped, by reason of the matters
alleged in those paragraphs of
the points of claim, from traversing specified matters in the defence.
<P>

2	The trial commenced yesterday.  Overnight the plaintiff has brought forward
its amended reply in which, in substance, it seeks
to rely in addition on two
other heads of estoppel, a conventional estoppel and an estoppel by
representation.  It says that, if
the amendment is allowed, the trial ought be
able to proceed today and tomorrow, which is the other day that has been
reserved for
the hearing, and that any additional investigations or evidence
necessary can be carried out or found during the adjournment which
will be
necessary after the end of tomorrow.  In that regard, the case was fixed for
three days only, but an enquiry by me of the
parties yesterday elicited the
frank response from both of them that they did not anticipate the case being
able to finish in these
three days, something that also seemed to me likely on
a preliminary examination of what is involved in the case.  Mr Taylor, of
Senior Counsel for the defendant, has said this morning that some of the
evidentiary discussion which was foreshadowed yesterday
may well be able to be
eliminated through decisions that he had taken overnight and that perhaps at
least the evidence in the case
would finish by the end of this week.  Whilst I
appreciate that what Mr Taylor has said would save some time, I remain very
sceptical
of even the evidence in the case finishing by the end of the week,
and still nobody seems to suggest that submissions could be dealt
with this
week.  As I indicated yesterday, by reason of other engagements, including a
long case starting next week, it would not
be until about August that I could
refix further days for the hearing of this case.  The application for
amendment and the possible
consequences of it must be viewed against the fact
that it is highly likely that the trial is not going to finish before August in
any event.  Mr Taylor has put to me that the trial could not realistically
continue at all during the balance of this three day fixture
if I allow the
amendment.  He says that the allegation, particularly of a conventional
estoppel, raises issues as to the parties'
relevant state of mind over a
considerable period of time in a specific way that has not previously been
raised in the proceedings,
and that it would be necessary for him, before
further conducting the defendant's case, to take further instructions on that
subject
matter.  Discovery may be necessary, or, if not discovery, at least
extensive further notices to produce or subpoenas.  He draws
attention to the
fact that no discovery has been had in the course of these proceedings to date.
Mr Jacobson, of Queen's Counsel
for the plaintiff, has said that there is no
reason why the trial should not continue during the balance of this three day
fixture,
bearing in mind the necessity for an adjournment at the end of the
three days in any event.
<P>

3	I think in the light of the foregoing, what Mr Taylor has said about the
future conduct of the trial is correct rather than what
Mr Jacobson has said.
Very often a trial can be continued after an amendment and no great
inconvenience is caused by its immediate
continuance, either because the
amendment does nothing but put a different legal characterisation on the same
body of facts, or because
the additional facts raised by the amendment are
discrete or minor, and can be dealt with without serious inconvenience at a
later
point of time.  However, in this case, Mr Jacobson concedes that he will
require further evidence in chief from Mr Simpson, the principal
of his client
company, which is not on affidavit and would at this stage have to be led
<i>viva voce, </i>going to Mr Simpson's state of mind.  This illustrates that
there is a body of evidence, perhaps not large, but significant, which
will now
have to be led in this case, and which may overlie, in effect, the whole of the
matters in issue.  The matters in issue
arise from difficulties in the
construction of a clause in a contract for the sale of land relating to the
potential necessity to
remediate contamination of the land, and the extent of
the work necessary, the cost of it and who was to carry it out.  There was
certainly a long course of dealing between the parties concerning the operation
of this clause after the contract was entered into
and that course of dealing
is or may be central to the decision of the case.  That much is clear from the
evidence that is already
in.  I do not think it is much use to seek to traverse
those matters further without the whole body of evidence being available
beforehand,
and the parties having had the opportunity to make whatever
investigation they need to in relation to the additional material.
<P>

4	Mr Taylor has pressed me that I should simply refuse the amendment because it
is brought at the heel of the hunt and bearing in
mind that the amounts of
money involved in this case are not huge.  He has said that the issues now
sought to be raised were "staring
the plaintiff in the face" throughout the
conduct of the proceedings and, not having been raised until this stage, they
simply ought
to be excluded.  Even on my comparatively short acquaintance with
the evidence, it does seem to me that there is some force in the
suggestion
that the issues were staring the plaintiff in the face.  In saying that, I do
not for a minute have any feeling that the
plaintiff's counsel or solicitors
have engaged in a course of conduct where they perceived this and have
deliberately delayed bringing
the amendment forward.  These things simply do
happen at times, even in well regulated families, if I may use the metaphor.
Whilst
there is some force in Mr Taylor's submission, the difficulty in
acceding to it is that it may lead to the case being determined
and the
parties' rights regulated upon a version of the facts which is not a true
version of the facts.  In my view, this is not
a case in which the defendant
cannot, at the right stage, be appropriately compensated for the cost of this
material being brought
forward at a late stage by an appropriate order as to
costs, and it is my view that the dictates of justice require, in those
circumstances,
that the plaintiff ought to be allowed to agitate this matter:
<b>The State of Queensland</b> <b>v J L Holdings Pty Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1997/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20189%20CLR%20146" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 189 CLR 146</a>
.  However, as flows from what I have already said and as I have indicated to
counsel for the plaintiff, if the amendment is granted,
it must be on the basis
that the case is immediately adjourned to a later day to permit the situation
to be dealt with.
<P>

5	In those circumstances, the order that I propose is that the further hearing
of the proceedings before me be adjourned to a day
to be fixed.
<P>

6	I have been pressed by Mr Taylor that I ought at once make both an order that
the plaintiff pay the defendant's costs thrown away
by the amendment and the
adjournment and an order under Part 52A rule 9 that those costs be assessed and
paid forthwith.  The latter
is not the usual order made and I do not propose to
depart from the usual course that interlocutory costs ordered are not to be
assessed
and paid until the termination of the proceedings.  Whilst there is an
attraction in making immediately an order that costs thrown
away be paid and
not deferring consideration of the question till a later time, I have formed
the view that in the present case it
is more appropriate to see precisely what
amendment is finally made and what in fact flows from that amendment before
dealing with
the question of costs.  I therefore reserve all questions of the
costs occasioned by the amendment and the adjournment.
<P>

7	I now propose to give directions in relation to the pleadings and for the
further conduct of the matter.  When I say the pleadings,
this case has to date
not proceeded on pleadings in the strict sense, but on points of claim and
points of defence, followed by a
reply and a proposed rejoinder.  We have a
curious mishmash of pleadings and non pleadings.  I had already yesterday
indicated that
I proposed to make an order that the proceedings continue on
pleadings.  While it is Mr Jacobson's current submission that the reply
is the
proper place for the allegations of estoppel, it is now at least possible that
allegations of estoppel may be made in a statement
of claim.  Mr Taylor has
submitted that I ought direct that the allegations of estoppel be made in the
statement of claim when filed.
 I do not intend to engage in shaping the
parties' pleadings.  However, I think the matters that Mr Taylor has put
forward are worthy
of consideration and I intend, by the directions, to provide
a <i>tabula rasa </i>on which the parties may engrave their pleadings anew. 
<P>

8	The orders that I now make are:
<P>

1	I order that these proceedings be adjourned part heard before me to a day to
be fixed.
<P>

2	I reserve all questions of costs arising from the plaintiff's application to
amend its reply and from this adjournment of the
proceedings.
<P>

(His Honour then proceeded to give directions for the filing of pleadings.)
