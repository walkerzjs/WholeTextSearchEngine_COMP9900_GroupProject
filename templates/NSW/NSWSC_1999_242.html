<b>YOUNG, J</b>
<P>

<b>FRIDAY, 19 MARCH 1999</b>
<P>

<b>1731/99 - HORWATH CORPORATE PTY LTD V HUIE</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>    This is a rather strange application for an
interlocutory injunction.
<P>

2	The plaintiff is the trustee of a scheme in which, to put it in an
oversimplified form (and which might not be completely accurate)
 people would
buy units in a residential building in an inner suburb.  They would then lease
those units to the trustee for about
seven years.  The trustee would pool the
units and operate them as part of a hotel and the profits from the pool would
be distributed
amongst the property owners.
<P>

3	Unfortunately, the scheme is faltering because, for one reason or another,
insufficient people have been staying in the hotel
to enable it to generate
profits.  This has caused, no doubt, problems to the unitholders who need to
fund their purchases and their
outgoings, but do not have the expected income
from the investment to be able to pay those moneys.  The trustee, on the other
hand,
considers that, in the near future, the enterprise will become profitable
and will enable the losses to be paid.  From what I hear
from the Bar table
about fifty percent of the unitholders think the trustee might be correct and
the other fifty percent are fed
up and want to get out of the arrangement.
<P>

4	The application today is for an injunction until next Tuesday, 23 March 1999.
If the injunction is granted the trustee indicates
it would seek judicial
advice as to whether it would be justified in pursuing avenues to obtain
finance to pay out its debtors and
whether the trust has or must be
terminated.
<P>

5	Mr Insall, who appeared with Mrs Champion for the plaintiff, says that it is
appropriate to grant an injunction for a short period
of time because the
plaintiff has either a prima facie case that the unitholders are not entitled
to put an end to the lease with
the trustee at this time, or alternatively they
have a reasonable case for relief against forfeiture and that in appropriate
cases
this Court will grant an injunction to protect that right; cf<b>
Riddington v Pye </b>Powell J, 27 February 1989, unreported.
<P>

6	On the other hand, Mr Robinson, who appears for the defendant in what might
be called an upside down representative action (the
defendant representing all
the people who wish to gain possession of their units) says that there is no
prima facie case and that
in any event the undertaking as to damages proffered
is inadequate and inappropriate.
<P>

7	Mr Williams, solicitor, who is instructed by various other unitholders also
sought to appear.  I did not formally  give him leave
to appear, but listened
attentively to what he had to say.  Essentially his position is that if the
only way the trustee can get
money to pay out the unitholders who are demanding
payment or re-entry is by borrowing against the only trust asset at a
substantial
discount, he does not want that to occur.  The material before the
court at the moment tends to indicate that this will be the way
the money is
raised, if it is raised at all, so I have taken Mr Williams' position to be
against the grant of an injunction.
<P>

8	There are five points to consider, three dealing with the question of whether
there is a prima facie case and two dealing with
the balance of convenience.
<P>

9	The first point made by Mr Insall and Mrs Champion in respect of the question
as to whether there is a prima facie case is that
the defendant and her fellow
unitholders have issued a notice under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 129</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act 1919</a> which
does not allow a reasonable time for the trustee as tenant to comply.
<P>

10	Mr Robinson says that as the notice required the payment of rates and the
like, it could have been done the next day, so that
one day was sufficient and
reasonable.  That might be right but, on the other hand, all I have to look at,
at this stage, is whether
the reverse proposition is arguable.
<P>

11	The reverse proposition is that if, as the landlord knows the tenant is a
trustee with limited recourse to assets, and the trustee
and the landlord
expect that the relevant debts will be paid out of profits generated by the
hotel, it is necessary to allow more
than the fifteen days that in fact was
given before the defendant purported to re-enter, to comply with the notice.
On this basis
it is put that the notice was not a notice which allowed a
reasonable time under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 129(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>.
<P>

12	Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 129</a> what is a reasonable time is a question of fact which must be
dealt with on the facts of each particular case.  It seems to me that
the
proposition for which Mr Insall and Mrs Champion contend is fairly arguable, so
on that basis there is an arguable case.
<P>

13	The second point is whether an injunction should go to protect an
application for relief against forfeiture.  I have no doubt,
as Powell J has
decided, that in an appropriate case it does.  However, this is hardly, in my
view, the appropriate case, because
this is not the situation of the tenant
being in doubt as to whom to pay the rent.  It has, it would appear from the
material before
the court today, deliberately chosen to pay unitholders last,
rather than first or pari passu.  Furthermore, there is just no real
prospect
at all, unless the trustee borrows contrary to the wishes of the unitholders
for whom Mr Williams appears, of it having
any real chance of paying the money
in the near future.  There are other problems with the submissions as well.
<P>

14	The third question is whether in the light of principles set out in<b> Re
Buchanan-Wollaston's Conveyance</b> [1939] Ch 217 and 738 the trust deed
pursuant to which the various tenants agreed to pool their units gives rise to
an equity to
restrain the other tenants exercising their legal rights under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s129.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
129</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing Act</a>.
<P>

15	Mr Insall points to para 14 on p 10 of the prospectus which deals with what
happens if the scheme makes a loss, and tends to
suggest that the landlord
needs to wait to recoup those losses in the next income producing period and,
accordingly, the landlord
should not determine the lease in the meantime.
<P>

16	It is necessary, if either party is going to rely on the
<b>Buchanan-Wollaston</b> principles, that the condition that gives rise to the
equitable right be very clearly expressed, and it is rather doubtful as to
whether the paragraph to which I have referred is sufficiently clear.  The
matter appears to me to be arguable, but only just.
<P>

17	As to balance of convenience, the first point is that the undertaking that
is proffered as to damages is that of the trustee
limited to the trust assets.
This is really a very limited undertaking as, on the evidence before me, the
trust assets are very meagre.
 Mr Insall said that a trustee of this nature
should not be required to give a personal undertaking as to damages, and refers
to
some English authority.
<P>

18	However, one cannot allow trustees of trading trusts to obtain benefits for
some of their beneficiaries by structuring the trust
in a particular way, or
having a trustee without assets.  The undertaking as to damages is the price of
getting an injunction and
unless those behind the trustee are prepared to fund
the appropriate undertaking as to damages normally no injunction will be given,
cf <b>Southern Tableland Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd v Schomberg </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2011%20ACLR%20337" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 11
ACLR 337.</a>
<P>

19	Mr Insall says it is unlikely that any damages will be incurred over the
weekend.  I take that point, but if that is so there
should have been no
difficulty in getting members of the class of unitholders who support the
trustee to fund a bank guarantee to
support the undertaking as to damages.
<P>

20	The second point is that it really does not matter very much one way or the
other whether an injunction is granted until Tuesday.
 Mr Insall says "Oh, yes
it does, because if there is no injunction other people who have not yet
re-entered may do so".
<P>

21	This argument is to a degree diluted by Mr Insall's other proposition, which
may well be correct (I do not rule on it), that
the defendant, who physically
got back into her unit, it would seem, by using a swipe key provided by the
agents of the trustee,
is not back in her unit in her own right but as claiming
under the person from whom she got the swipe key.
<P>

22	If that argument is right then no real harm is done by allowing that sort of
conduct to continue until next Tuesday.  Even if
that was not correct, then if
there is a proper case for relief against forfeiture, that case can be run
whether or not there is
a re-entry.  The only difference will be the form of
relief against forfeiture that is given.
<P>

23	Accordingly, it seem to me the balance of convenience means that I should
just allow market forces to play. Everybody knows what
their rights and risks
are and, accordingly, I do not consider that I should continue the
injunction.
<P>

24	I stand the proceedings over for mention before the Registrar on 26 March
1999.  Costs reserved.
