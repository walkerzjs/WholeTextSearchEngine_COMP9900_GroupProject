<b>JUDGMENT:</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74o.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 74O</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act 1900</a>
<P>

provides, so far as is material, that where a caveat lapses any further caveat
by the same caveator in respect of the same estate
or interest and purporting
to be based on the same facts has no effect unless the Supreme Court has made
an order giving leave for
the lodgment of the further caveat and that order or
an office copy of it accompanies the further caveat when lodged with the
Registrar
General. 
<P>

	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74l.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 74L</a> provides, so far as is material, that if in any legal proceedings
a question arises as to the validity of a caveat the court shall
disregard any
failure to comply strictly with the requirements of the subject part of the
Act.
<P>

	The facts deposed to in these proceedings are in summary and so far as is
material as follows.  It is asserted that monies to which
the plaintiff had an
entitlement in equity were used in substantial part to discharge a mortgage
over the subject property and to
effect repairs and improvements to the subject
property.
<P>

	On 30 June 1998 a caveat was lodged in respect of the property by the present
plaintiff Hanover Investments Pty Limited being the
party claiming the relevant
interest arising from the application of the monies to which I have referred.
That caveat was registered
on 13 July 1998.
<P>

	In that caveat the nature of the estate or interest in the land claimed by the
caveator was as follows: 
<P>

"Equitable interest as beneficiary of a constructive trust, the registered
proprietor having received and unconscionably used the
caveator's money in
discharge of a mortgage over the property and effecting repairs and
improvements thereto".
<P>

	It is common ground that the caveat lapsed within the
<P>

meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74o.html" class="autolink_findacts">S.74O.</a> The evidence is that the plaintiff did not resist the lapsing
of that caveat because it was advised that the asserted estate or interest
in
the land could not be sustained on the information then available. The evidence
is that at that stage the plaintiff, although
suspecting the way in which the
monies had been applied, was not in a position to establish by evidence that
this was so.
<P>

	What then transpired was that, in proceedings initially instituted in
Queensland but then transferred to New South  Wales, a defence
was filed on
behalf of the registered proprietor of the property and others which admitted
to the application of the proceeds of
the sale of certain units in a property
trust to discharging a mortgage over the subject property and to effecting
repairs and improvements
to the property.  The evidence in the present
proceedings shows that the plaintiff in the present proceedings has a bona fide
basis
upon which to argue that the monies so applied were monies to which it
has an equitable claim and accordingly that the application
of those monies
gave rise to an estate or interest in equity in the subject property. 
<P>

	A second caveat was then lodged dated 30 October 1998 and registered on that
day.  The nature of the estate or interest claimed
in that caveat was as
follows:
<P>

"Equitable interest by virtue of the facts stated below. Arising out of the
registered proprietor utilising monies the subject of
a trust of which the
caveator is a beneficiary such monies being used to discharge a mortgage over
the land and to effect improvements
thereto."
<P>

	Counsel for the plaintiff submits that the second
<P>

caveat was not in respect of the same estate or interest as the first, he
concedes that it was based on the same facts.  The distinction
sought to be
drawn is that the estate or interest asserted by the first caveat was one as
beneficiary under a constructive trust
whereas the estate or interest asserted
under the second caveat was an entitlement to an equitable charge. 
<P>

	I am of the opinion that it is not permissible to look beyond the language of
the caveats in order to resolve the issue as to whether
the estate or interest
claimed in the respective caveats is the same or different.  
<P>

	The situation is that the first caveat asserts an equitable interest as
beneficiary of a constructive trust whereas the second
asserts an equitable
interest without further definition as to the nature of that interest.  The
estate or interest asserted in the
first caveat is within the ambit of that
asserted in the second. That asserted in the second is wider than that asserted
in the first.
The second would comprehend an equitable charge as well as a
constructive trust. 
<P>

	Whilst there are some distinctions to be drawn between a constructive trust
and an equitable charge it seems to me that to assert
a substantive difference
between the estate or interest claimed in the respective caveats is to draw too
fine a line.  Moreover,
because the wording in the second caveat asserts an
estate or interest in terms sufficient to cover the estate or interest asserted
in the first caveat, it is impossible to contend that the second caveat is not
lodged in respect of the estate or interest asserted
in the first. 
<P>

	I proceed therefore on the basis that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74o.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74O</a> is attracted, such that, in terms
of the section, the second caveat has no effect unless the proviso to the
section be satisfied.
<P>

	The evidence before me shows that the Registrar General gave notice to the
plaintiff that he intended to remove the recording of
the second caveat from
the register on the ground that it asserted the same estate or interest as the
first. In the present proceedings
the plaintiff has joined the Registrar
General as the defendant.  The registered proprietor of the subject property
has not been
joined. 
<P>

	On behalf of the Registrar General the view of the effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74o.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74O</a> in relation
to the second caveat which I have expressed in this judgment was supported. The
first claim made in the summons filed
by the plaintiff in the present
proceedings is for a declaration that the second caveat is not invalid by the
operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74o.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74O.</a> For the reasons I have given that claim must be refused.

<P>

	The second claim is for an injunction restraining the Registrar General from
cancelling the recording of the caveat. For the same
reasons that claim must be
refused. 
<P>

	The third claim is in the alternative, being for an order pursuant to the
proviso to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74o.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74O</a> granting leave to the plaintiff nunc pro tunc for the lodgment
of the caveat.  
<P>

	As I read <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74o.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74O</a>, the court has no power to make an order pursuant to the
proviso to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74o.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74O</a> which would have retrospective effect. The section provides,
as part of the proviso, that any such order or an office copy must accompany
the further caveat when lodged with the Registrar General. That part of the
proviso could not be complied with in the case of an
order which purported to
operate in relation to a caveat that has already been lodged. It cannot
therefore have been intended by
the legislature that the court would have power
to make an order which had effect in relation to a caveat already lodged.
<P>

	My attention has been drawn to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74L.</a>  However, I am of the opinion that that
section has no application which would enlarge the power of the court in the
way sought by
the plaintiff. 
<P>

	It follows that the claim for an order pursuant to the proviso to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/s74o.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 74O</a> must
be refused. 
<P>

	The plaintiff's summons claims such further or other order as the court sees
fit. Counsel for the plaintiff submits that the court
should at least now make
an order pursuant to the proviso in order to enable a further caveat to be
lodged. I am of the opinion that
in the circumstances of this case it is
appropriate for the court to grant that relief. The circumstances in which the
first caveat
lapsed do not seem to me to be such as to make it just and
reasonable that the plaintiff should be denied the protection of its claimed
interest by caveat. 
<P>

	Accordingly, I propose to make an order pursuant to the proviso. I have
mentioned that the registered proprietor has not been joined
as a defendant to
these proceedings. I am in some doubt as to whether that ought to have been
done. It is appropriate in those circumstances
for me to direct that a copy of
the orders which I will make and a copy of this judgment be served on the
registered proprietor and
that I give liberty to apply to the registered
proprietor. 
<P>

	What I have said in that regard and the direction I propose to give in that
regard should not be construed as a decision by me
that the registered
proprietor has a right to be heard in relation to the proceedings. I express no
view in that regard either way.
<P>

	Mr Wright on behalf of the Registrar General applies for an order for the
costs of the present proceedings. Counsel for the plaintiff
submits there
should be no order as to costs. The position is that although interesting
arguments were raised in support of the summons,
the plaintiff has failed in
its case against the Registrar General and the order which it has obtained is
not one which the Registrar
General gave notice it would oppose, nor did the
Registrar General oppose that order.
<P>

	In these circumstances, costs should follow the result in the ordinary way.
The plaintiff is ordered to pay the Registrar General's
costs of the summons.

<P>

	I make an order pursuant to paragraph 1 of the short minutes of order dated 27
January 1999 which I have initialled. I note paragraph
2. I make orders
pursuant to paragraphs 3,4,4A,5 and 6 of the short minutes of order. 
<P>
