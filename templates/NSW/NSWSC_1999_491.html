<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER</b>: These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act
</i>1982</a>.
<P>

2	By summons filed on 11 February 1998 Nathan Mark Griffiths, Ryan Luke
Griffiths and Lauren Rochelle Griffiths, by their next friend
Deborah Helen
Sinclair, claim an order that provision be made for the maintenance, education,
and advancement in life of each plaintiff
out of the estate and/or the notional
estate of their late father Mark Raymond Griffiths (to whom I shall refer as
"the deceased").
<P>

3	At the time of the institution of the proceedings each of the three
plaintiffs was an infant (Nathan having been born on 3 January
1981, Ryan
having been born 19 March 1982, and Lauren having been born on 6 November
1984). Accordingly, the proceedings were instituted
on behalf of the three
plaintiffs by their mother, Deborah Helen Sinclair, acting as their next
friend.
<P>

4	It will be appreciated that Nathan is now an adult, having achieved the age
of 18 on 3 January 1999. Accordingly, at the outset
of the hearing I made an
order that Nathan Mark Griffiths, now no longer an infant, be joined as a
plaintiff, and that Deborah Helen
Sinclair cease to act as next friend of the
said Nathan Mark Griffiths.
<P>

5	Since Ryan is presently aged 17 and Lauren aged 15, the proceedings on behalf
of each of those plaintiffs are still maintained
by their next friend.
<P>

6	The deceased died, aged thirty-nine, on 19 June 1996. He left a will dated 17
August 1995, Probate whereof was on 10 February
1997 granted to Sandra Nicole
Griffiths, the executor named in such will (who is the defendant to the present
proceedings). 
<P>

7	It should here be noted that the proceedings were not instituted within the
prescribed period of eighteen months from the death
of the deceased, and were
about eight weeks out of time. It will be necessary, in due course, to consider
the application made, <i>ore tenus</i>, on behalf of the plaintiffs for
extension of that prescribed period. 
<P>

8	By his will the deceased, in the events which have happened, gave the
entirety of his estate to the defendant. The inventory of
property discloses
that the only asset held by the deceased at the time of his death was a deposit
fund with Westpac in an amount
of $5,825. However, at the time of his death the
deceased and the defendant as joint tenants owned a house property situate at
and
known as 10 Barrie Close, Williamtown ("the Williamtown property"), which
had been the matrimonial home of the deceased at the time
of his death. That
property passes to the defendant by survivorship.
<P>

9	The deceased had been married twice. On 18 December 1976 he married Deborah
Helen (now Mrs Sinclair). Of that marriage were born
the three plaintiffs. That
marriage was dissolved on 24 June 1991. Certain orders were made by consent in
the proceedings in the
Family Court of Australia for dissolution of that
marriage. Those orders included an order that the next friend and the deceased
have joint guardianship of their three children, but that the deceased have
custody of the three children. Further, that the next
friend pay maintenance to
the deceased in respect of the children. Orders were also made in relation to
property, including an order
that the deceased pay the next friend the sum
$63,000 for the transfer to him of the interest of the next friend in the house
property
at 17 Ocean View Parade, Coves Beach, which had been the former
matrimonial home of the deceased and the next friend.
<P>

10	On 21 November 1993 the deceased married Sandra Nicole (now Mrs Griffiths),
to whom he was still married at the time of his death.
The next friend on 17
April 1994 married Reg Thomas Sinclair.
<P>

11	At the time of his marriage to the defendant the deceased was still residing
at the Caves Beach residence, with his three children.
In May 1994 the deceased
and the defendant purchased as joint tenants the house property at 10 Barrie
Close, Williamtown. The purchase
price for that property came in part from the
proceeds of sale of the Caves Beach residence, and the balance from a
redundancy payment
received by the deceased when he accepted redundancy from
his employment by Telstra in 1994. The deceased was for a time in receipt
of
unemployment benefits, and then spent some time working two or three days a
week in the driving school business conducted by the
defendant's father. 
<P>

12	In September 1995 the deceased underwent a surgical procedure for the
removal of his lymph glands. Although initially that operation
was regarded as
having been successful, in early 1996 the deceased was diagnosed as suffering
from terminal cancer. 
<P>

13	From September 1995 until the time of his death the deceased was in receipt
of an invalid pension. The defendant was at that
time self-employed in her own
hairdressing business. 
<P>

14	For about four months preceding his death the deceased was bedridden. It was
necessary for the defendant to nurse him throughout
that period, giving him all
assistance, attending to feeding and washing, and administering morphine to him
every two hours. In addition,
she had the responsibility of looking after the
three children (who continued to reside with their father after he married the
defendant),
getting them to school, preparing their meals, attending to their
clothing, and performing all other household chores. The defendant
was also
attempting to maintain her own hairdressing business.
<P>

15	Upon the death of the deceased Nathan and Ryan returned to reside with their
mother at Warners Bay, whilst for about a year after
her father's death Lauren
continued to reside with the defendant. She has now returned to live with her
mother.
<P>

16	Nathan left Maitland High School at the end of 1998 after completing Year
12, and since then he has been in employment as a sales
assistant. His Higher
School Certificate marks were not sufficient to gain for him entry into a
university. He now has an ambition
to join the New South Wales Police Service,
but for that he requires a TER. 
<P>

17	Nathan has now made inquiries at the University of Newcastle about enrolling
in what is known as the NewStep course, commencing
at the beginning of 2000, in
order to obtain a TER. The NewStep course is a full-time course. The total cost
of enrolment will be
$145. Nathan will no longer be able to work in his present
employment to support himself financially whilst he is attending that
course,
which he described as being like going back to school. He said in his affidavit
evidence that he could not see his way clear
to being able to complete the
NewStep course unless he receives some financial assistance.
<P>

18	When he obtains his TER Nathan will be in a position to make an application
to join the Police Service and to attend a one year
training course at the
Police Academy at Goulbourn. He said in his affidavit that he had really set
his heart on joining the Police
Service. During that one year course it would
be necessary for Nathan to arrange accommodation at his own expense, either
residing
in the Academy (at an accommodation fee of $100 a week) or acquiring
his own accommodation in the Goulbourn area and travelling daily
to the
Academy. Nathan said that on his current wage he was unable to save any money
and would have no prospect of being able to
attend the Police Academy unless he
received some financial assistance. He estimated the cost of accommodation and
sustenance in
Goulbourn would be a minimum of $200 a week during the twelve
month course. 
<P>

19	Nathan is currently employed as a sales assistant with Warners Bay Pool
Shop, for which he receives a wage of $286 a week. He
no longer resides with
his mother, because of the distance to Warners Bay from her present residence
at Sawyers Gully (near Kurri
Kurri). He is currently sharing rented premises
with a friend, of which his liability for rent is $65 a week. He has been
working
in the pool shop since October 1998. 
<P>

20	Nathan has no significant assets. When he moved into his present flat at
Broadmeadow he borrowed $1,200 from a cousin. He has
very recently repaid the
totality of that loan, and, at the time of the hearing, had $63 in his bank
account. He has little in the
way of furniture in his flat, and is currently
saving in order to acquire some additional furniture. 
<P>

21	It is Nathan's desire to acquire a second-hand motor vehicle, so that he can
drive to and from work, and later to and from the
University of Newcastle. The
travel by public transport from his residence at Broadmeadow to his employment
at Warners Bay is difficult.
He has made inquiries concerning the acquisition
of a motor car, and has ascertained that he could purchase a 1995 Proton GL
sedan
for $9,500. 
<P>

22	Nathan is currently attending a driving school, with a view to obtaining a
driver's licence. However, he has been told that he
will require another ten
lessons at $30 a lesson. In addition, he will be obliged to pay a test booking
fee of $32 and a licence
fee of $34. He does not consider that he currently has
sufficient funds to meet all those fees.
<P>

23	Ryan has also left school (I gather at the end of 1997, when he was aged
fifteen). In 1998 he attended a carpentry pre-apprenticeship
course at TAFE.
Ryan is employed in a casual position by Geotechnic and receives a wage of $250
a week. He is presently staying with
a friend at Raymond Terrace (in what is
very basic accommodation). He travels to and from his work (which is located on
the Pacific
Highway near Raymond Terrace) on a motorbike, which was purchased
for him by his mother. He expects shortly to receive his motor
car driver's
licence. Ryan has no significant assets other than his motorbike.
<P>

24	Lauren is still at school, attending Rutherford High School. Her mother is
hopeful that she will eventually attend university.

<P>

25	The defendant is twenty-nine years of age (having been born on 15 October
1969). She is a qualified hairdresser. During the period
of her marriage she
was employed as a hairdresser for part of the time and had her own hairdressing
business for part of the time.
She acquired that business in May 1993 for about
$14,000 (that price being essentially for the goodwill of the business), and
sold
the business in about March - April 1997 for about $12,500. From that
amount she repaid to her parents a loan of $10,000 which they
had provided to
assist her in establishing the business. 
<P>

26	The defendant is presently employed as a hairdresser receiving a weekly
salary of $408 (net). Occasionally she receives a commission
of $50 added to
her weekly salary (that commission depending upon, as I understand it, the
number of clients she attends to during
the week). However, it should here be
noted that the defendant suffers from problems with her back, which (according
to the report
of Dr G. Mah, dated 13 April 1999, Exhibit 2) may have an effect
upon her ability to continue her occupation as a hairdresser. 
<P>

27	Apart from her interest in the house property at Williamtown, the assets of
the defendant consist of a Hyundai Lantra motor vehicle
(having an insured
value of $18,000), and amounts in two savings accounts, totalling less than
$500. The defendant owes debts to
her parents ($10,000) and her grandmother
($5,044, for her legal costs of the present proceedings), and a personal loan
in respect
of the motor vehicle (of which the amount outstanding at the time of
the hearing was a little over $13,000, which the defendant is
paying off at
$92.50 a week). In addition, she has been responsible for the payment of all
outgoings on the Williamtown property
since the death of the deceased.
<P>

28	The defendant, who under the will receives the entirety of the estate of the
deceased, is desirous of disposing of the Williamtown
property. The reason is
that that property is too far from her place of employ, and, further, that she
is desirous of residing closer
to her own parents (who live at Wallsend).
<P>

29	Originally she placed the Williamtown property for auction at $229,000.
However, the highest bid when it was put up for auction
was $205,000. She
accepted that offer, but the purchaser was not able to proceed with the
purchase. The defendant is prepared to
sell the property for $205,000. The
hearing proceeded upon the basis that, ultimately, the property would be sold
for that figure,
and that after payment agent's commission, sales expenses and
associated legal costs there would remain about $190,000 as the net
proceeds of
the sale of that property.
<P>

30	It will be appreciated that since the Williamtown property was owned by the
deceased and the defendant as joint tenants, the
interest therein of the
deceased has by survivorship passed to the defendant. It will be necessary for
the defendant to acquire some
other residence. Evidence was placed before the
Court as to the cost of alternative accommodation in the Newcastle area.
According
to the defendant, it would be difficult for her to acquire
appropriate accommodation for her needs and desires at less that $170,000.
That
figure was disputed by the plaintiffs. There was placed in evidence (as Exhibit
F) an edition of the Multilist Realtor dated
9 April 1999 setting forth details
of accommodation available in the Newcastle and District area. It was submitted
on behalf of the
plaintiffs that appropriate accommodation could be  acquired
by the defendant for not much more than $100,000.
<P>

31	Each of the plaintiffs as a child of the deceased is an eligible person
within paragraph (b) of the definition of that phrase
contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6</a>
(1) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. Each plaintiff thus has the standing to
bring the present proceedings. The defendant also, as the widow of the
deceased, is an eligible
person, within paragraph (a) of that definition. The
only other eligible person in relation to the deceased is Deborah Helen
Sinclair,
the mother of the plaintiffs, who, as the former wife of the
deceased, is an eligible person within paragraph (c) of that definition.
She
makes no claim against the estate of the deceased. 
<P>

32	The claim of the plaintiffs must be approached in the light of any competing
claims upon the testamentary bounty of the deceased.
In the instant case the
only such competing claim is that of the defendant, who under the will of the
deceased was entitled to the
entire estate of the deceased.
<P>

33	It will be appreciated that the actual estate of the deceased (consisting of
$5,825, being the proceeds of a superannuation entitlement)
will not be
sufficient to meet the costs and administration expenses of the estate, let
alone the costs of the present proceedings
(which are estimated for the
plaintiffs alone to total $30,000). Accordingly, if an entitlement to any order
for provision for any
or all of the plaintiffs is established, such order can
be met only out of the notional estate of the deceased. 
<P>

34	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that, as a result of the
deceased entering into a prescribed transaction of the
nature contemplated by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 22</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i> (that prescribed transaction
being the failure of the deceased to sever the joint tenancy in respect of the
Williamtown property),
a one half share in that property (and, ultimately, in
the proceeds of sale of that property) constitutes notional estate of the
deceased to which resort may be had by the Court in order to satisfy any order
for provision an entitlement to which one or all of
the plaintiffs may
otherwise have established.
<P>

35	A very considerable quantity of evidence (both by affidavit and by way of
oral evidence, especially by way of cross-examination
of the next friend of the
plaintiffs) was directed to the circumstances concerning the acquisition and
present ownership by the next
friend of a house property situate at and known
as 15 Kirkland Close, Warners Bay, and the intentions of the next friend and
her
mother concerning the disposition of the proceeds of sale, if and when that
property is sold. That property was acquired in 1992
for the sum of $152,770.
The purchase price was funded by an amount of $88,660 provided by Mrs Nora
Helen Ball, the mother of the
next friend, and the balance of $64,110 by the
next friend herself. The purpose, as I understood it, of that evidence was an
attempt
on the part of the defendant to establish that the next friend could
adequately provide for the needs of and support the plaintiffs,
by having
resort to that Warners Bay property (which is presently unoccupied).
<P>

36	I do not consider that the ability of the plaintiffs' mother (assuming that
she does in fact have such ability) to support the
plaintiffs is determinative
of the present claim of the plaintiffs against the estate of their late father.
It will be appreciated
that it was the deceased who upon his divorce from their
mother was awarded the custody of the three plaintiffs, and that they resided
with him and the defendant until his death (and, in the case of Lauren, for a
year after his death, with the defendant). Indeed,
by the orders of the  Family
Court the plaintiffs' mother was required to pay to the deceased the sum of
$20,000 for maintenance
of the plaintiffs. Throughout the period whilst the
children were living with him the deceased was primarily responsible for their
maintenance and support, and it is (as was submitted on behalf of the
plaintiffs) more than likely that, had the deceased not died
at the young age
of thirty-nine, he would have continued to be primarily responsible for his
three children until they became self
supporting, and had embarked upon their
own careers.
<P>

37	Whether or not the mother of the plaintiffs, if she and her own mother
decide to dispose of a property in which each of them
has a beneficial
interest, would thereupon be able to support her three children, those three
children are not thereupon deprived
of an entitlement to an order of the nature
sought in the summons; and neither the deceased nor his estate is thereupon
discharged
from a responsibility to make provision for the maintenance,
education and advancement in life of each those three children.
<P>

38	However, that responsibility must be considered in the context of the
responsibility of the deceased to make provision for his
widow, a
responsibility, which, by the terms of his will, he fully recognised. It will,
however, be appreciated that the marriage
was a short one, subsisting for only
two and a half years. That fact seems to me be of significance when considering
the application
to the instant case of the principles (such as that enunciated
by Powell J in <i>Luciano</i> <i>v</i> <i>Rosenblum</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%202%20NSWLR%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 2 NSWLR 65)</a>
concerning the responsibilities of a testator towards his widow.
<P>

39	The practical problem in the instant case is that, even if I am satisfied
--- as I am --- that the deceased, by failing to sever
the joint tenancy during
his lifetime, entered into a prescribed transaction, with the consequence that
the one half interest of
the deceased in the Williamtown property is available
to be designated as notional estate of the deceased, that notional estate must
then bear any order for provision which might be made in favour of the
plaintiffs, together with any order in respect to the costs
of the proceedings
both of the plaintiffs and of the defendant. Further, any remaining balance of
that one half interest, when taken
with the one half of the Williamtown
property which does not constitute notional estate of the deceased and to which
the defendant
is absolutely entitled, must be sufficient to enable her to
acquire other accommodation. 
<P>

40	Even if, as was submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs, I accept that the
defendant can acquire adequate accommodation for about
$100,000 that would
still leave only about $90,000 (upon the assumption that the net proceeds of
sale of the Williamtown property
are about $190,000) to meet any order for
provision for the plaintiffs and to meet any costs orders.
<P>

41	I am satisfied that each plaintiff has established an entitlement to an
order for provision, not only for maintenance (in the
case of Nathan and Ryan)
but also for advancement in life and education in the case of each of the three
plaintiffs. Such orders
for provision will also attract costs orders in favour
of the plaintiffs, and the defendant as executor is also entitled to her costs
out of the estate. 
<P>

42	Within the constraints of an extremely small fund available to bear any
orders for provision, I have reached the conclusion that
Nathan has established
an entitlement to a legacy in the sum of $20,000, Ryan to a legacy in the sum
of $20,000 and Lauren to a legacy
in the sum of $15,000. The larger legacies to
Nathan and Ryan reflect the fact that they must maintain themselves, whilst
Lauren
at the present time is being maintained by her mother. The plaintiffs
and the defendant will also be entitled to have their respective
costs out of
the estate. Had the fund available to meet the claims of the plaintiffs (as
well as to bear the costs of all parties)
been greater, I would have awarded
each plaintiff a greater legacy.
<P>

43	There remains to be considered, however, the question of extension of time.
I have already observed that the proceedings were
instituted some eight weeks
after the expiration of the period of eighteen months after the death of the
deceased, prescribed by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16</a> (1) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. The
Court, by subsection (3) of that section, is vested with a discretion to extend
that period in circumstances where the reason
for the proceedings not having
been instituted within time has been explained. 
<P>

44	The defendant opposes such an extension of time. The explanation offered by
the plaintiffs and the factors relied upon in support
of the application for an
extension of time are, firstly, the fact that each of the plaintiffs was an
infant at the time of the institution
of the proceedings. Further, in his
affidavit sworn on 21 May 1998 Eric Richard Leslie Butler, the solicitor for
the plaintiffs,
states that because of the complicated nature of the claims
(which I understand to be a reference to the fact that, for practical
purposes,
there would be no actual assets in the estate of the deceased to meet any order
for provision in favour of the plaintiffs,
and that the plaintiffs would need
to establish, firstly, the existence of a prescribed transaction, and,
secondly, the availability
of notional estate to meet any such order for
provision), he did not on behalf of the plaintiffs file a summons until he had
received
sufficient instructions to brief Counsel. Those instructions were
received from the next friend only on 9 February 1998. However,
the solicitor
for the plaintiffs had as early as 18 August 1997 been in correspondence with
both the defendant herself and subsequently
her solicitors. 
<P>

45	The plaintiffs further point to the fact that there is no prejudice to the
defendant if the prescribed period is extended, that
the defendant and her
solicitor were under notice of the proposed claim of the plaintiffs from
mid-August 1997, some four months
before the expiration of the prescribed
period, and that the defendant did not alter her situation or circumstances in
any way from
the expiration of the prescribed period until the institution of
the proceedings.
<P>

46	I have been taken to the decision of Cohen J in <i>Warren v McKnight</i>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1996/419.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] NSWSC 419</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%20390" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR 390</a>, and <i>Dare v Furness</i> (1997) 44 NSWLR 495 at 500, in
respect to the application for extension of time. 
<P>

47	The desire of the solicitor for the plaintiffs, proper in the circumstances
of this case, to brief Counsel before filing the
summons, and the fact that the
solicitor did not receive "sufficient instructions" to brief Counsel until 9
February 1998, after
the expiry of the prescribed period, in my view, combine
to constitute sufficient cause for the application not having been made
within
that period. Thus the Court is not precluded by the provisions of subsection
(3) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16</a> of the Act to proceeding to an exercise of the discretion
vested in it by subsection (2) of that section to extend the prescribed
period.
<P>

48	Whilst the disability of infancy to which each of the plaintiffs was subject
at the time of the institution of the proceedings
is not of itself
determinative of the application for extension of time, it seems to me that it
is a very significant factor, which,
taken in conjunction with an absence of
any prejudice to the defendant by such extension, the express notice of the
intended claim
given to the defendant and her solicitors four months before the
expiry of the prescribed period, and the fact that, as I have concluded,
each
of the plaintiffs has established an entitlement to an order for provision,
justifies the extension of the prescribed period
sought by the plaintiff.
<P>

49	Accordingly, I make the following orders:
<P>

	1.	I order that the time for the institution of these 	proceedings be extended
up to and including 11 	February 1998.
<P>

	2. 	I order that a one-half interest in the house property 	situate at and
known as 10 Barrie Close, 	Williamtown, be designated
as notional estate of the
late Mark Raymond Griffiths ("the deceased"), and 	that the defendant hold such
interest upon trust for
	the estate of the deceased. 
<P>

	3. 	I order that the following legacies be paid out of the 	notional estate of
the deceased:
<P>

	(a) Nathan Mark Griffiths - $20,000
<P>

	(b) Ryan Luke Griffiths - $20,000
<P>

	(c) Lauren Rochelle Griffiths - $15,000,
<P>

	and that the first of the aforesaid legacies not bear interest if paid within
three months of the date of the making of this order.

<P>

	4. 	I reserve to each of the plaintiffs Ryan Luke Griffiths 	and Lauren
Rochelle Griffiths liberty to apply in 	respect to the
manner in which and by
whom his or 	her respective legacy be held during the minority of 	that
plaintiff and in respect to any advancement
	from or payment of part or all of
such legacy or any 	income thereon during such minority.
<P>

	5. 	I order that the costs of the plaintiffs on the party 	and party basis and
the costs of the defendant on the 	indemnity basis
be paid out of the notional
estate of 	the deceased. 
<P>

6. 	The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
