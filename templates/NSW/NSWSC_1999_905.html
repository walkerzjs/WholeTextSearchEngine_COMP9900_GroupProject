<b>			&amp; 2 ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Quash orders of Consumer Claims Tribunal;</b>
<P>

<b>  Denial of natural justice)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By amended summons filed 22 April 1999 the
plaintiff seeks orders firstly, that the decision made on 4 February 1999 in
proceedings
No TSY98/1443 of the Consumer Claims Tribunal (the Tribunal) be set
aside;  secondly, that the first defendant be restrained from
enforcing or
otherwise acting upon the decision of the tribunal and proceedings No 7 of 1999
at the Local Court Batemans Bay;  thirdly,
that the proceedings before the
tribunal be declared null and void and fourthly, a declaration that the
tribunal did not hear or
determine the said proceedings according to the rules
of natural justice.  
<P>

2  	By notice of motion filed 18 May 1999 the plaintiff seeks a
declaration that the monies paid by the plaintiff to the Sheriff
on 21 April
1999 were paid in error and an order that the first defendant direct the
Sheriff at Fairfield to repay the monies to
the plaintiff forthwith.  If the
summons is dismissed it follows that the notice of motion should also be
dismissed.  The plaintiff
relied on an affidavit of Leo Lewin sworn 15 June
1999.  The first defendant did not rely on any affidavit evidence.  The parties
to these proceedings are Lew's Discount Carpet Pty Limited (plaintiff),
Browseabout Markets Pty Limited (first defendant) (Browseabout),
Barry Beeton
(second defendant) and the Consumer Claims Tribunal (third Defendant).  It has
filed a submitting appearance.
<P>

3  	The second defendant by the affidavit of his solicitor David
Francis Hawdon sworn 19 May 1999 stated that he be excused from
further
appearance in these proceedings (para 11).  He did not appear.  Pursuant to s
44(1) of the <b>Consumer Claims Tribunal Act</b> 1987, the Minister of Fair
Trading sought and was granted leave to intervene in these proceedings.  It
should be added as fourth
defendant and I make such an order.
<P>

4  	The facts are as follows:
<P>

(1)	Mr Leo Lewin is a director of the plaintiff company.
<P>

(2)	The plaintiff was joined as a party to proceedings before the Consumer
Claims Tribunal No TSY98/1443.  Browseabout brought proceedings
against Mr
Barry Beeton and Lew's Discount Carpet Pty Limited.
<P>

(3)	On 15 January 1999 the Tribunal issued a notice to the plaintiff advising
it that the matter was listed for hearing at Batemans
Bay Court house on 4
February 1999.  There is no dispute that the plaintiff received this notice.
<P>

(4)	On 15 January 1999 Mr Lewin did not attend before the Tribunal.  The
Tribunal heard the consumer claim.
<P>

(5)	On 2 March 1999 the plaintiff wrote to the registrar Consumer Claims
Tribunal at Wollongong.  He stated that he was not able
to attend the tribunal
hearing on 4 February 1999 due to ill health.  The letter further stated that
he had been confined to bed
and had only recently been able to return to work
and had been unable to carry out business commitments and unable to contact the
registry sooner.  Mr Lewin's evidence is that he was suffering from chronic
tonsillitis, was unable to speak and was confined to
bed.  The letter attached
medical certificates (the one of 9 February 1999 is not in evidence).  The
medical certificate of Dr Singh
is dated 2 March 1999 and recorded that when Mr
Lewin was examined on 3 February 1999, he was suffering from a severe upper
respiratory
infection with a high fever, was confined to bed and unable to
work.  The letter also explained that Mr Lewin was the only person
who had
authority to make decisions for the company.  The letter concluded by
requesting a rehearing.
<P>

(6)	On 10 March 1999 judgment was entered in favour of Browseabout Markets Pty
Limited against Lew's Discount Carpet Pty Limited
in the local court at
Batemans Bay for the sum of $6,536.
<P>

(7)	On 18 March 1999 the registry wrote to the plaintiff and advised it that
the Tribunal had reviewed his application and decided
not to grant a rehearing
on the claim and that the Tribunal's order of 4 February 1999 was still in
effect.
<P>

(8)	On 22 March 1999 the registry forwarded the Tribunal's decision to the
plaintiff.  The Tribunal decided a fair and reasonable
amount to be paid by
Lew's Discount Carpet Pty Limited to Browseabout was $6,490.  Browseabout had
claimed $8,300.
<P>

(9)	A writ of execution issued for the sum of $6,536.
<P>

5  	Mr Lewin submitted that he was denied natural justice because he
was not allowed to put the company's view before the Tribunal,
namely that the
plaintiff has never warranted that the carpet provided to the first defendant
was a commercial quality carpet.
<P>

<b><u>The Law</u></b>
<P>

6  	The plaintiff relied on s 12(2)(b)(ii) of the Consumer Claims
Tribunal Act 1987 which gives this court the jurisdiction to grant
relief in
relation to the hearing or determination of the claim if a party has been
denied natural justice.  No appeal lies to this
court where errors of fact or
law have occurred.  
<P>

7  	At the outset, it is helpful to set out some of the provisions of
the <b>Consumer Claims Tribunal Act</b> 1987.  The Tribunal is not constrained
by the rigour of the court room.  In a sense, its function is to mete out rough
justice or
at least a less than perfect form of justice in an economical way
appropriate for disputes within the limits of its jurisdiction.
 Evidence
before the Tribunal must be relevant to the determination of a claim (s 23(1)
of the <b>Consumer Claims Tribunal Act</b> 1987 as amended) and must be given
on oath or statutory declaration (s 23(2) - s 23(3)) but the Tribunal is not
bound by the rules
or practice of evidence and the Tribunal may inform itself
on any matter in such manner as it considers appropriate (s 23(4) - see
also s
29(4)).  Its business is conducted in private (s 22(1)).  There is no
requirement that Referees constituting the Tribunal
be legally qualified.  The
orders of the Tribunal must, in its opinion, be "fair and equitable" (s 31(1)).
The tribunal has no power
to award costs (s 28).  Pursuant to s 29 of the
<b>Act</b> the Tribunal is obliged to use its best endeavours to bring the
parties to a settlement before making any order.
<P>

8  	In <b><u>Hutley v Meigan &amp; Ors</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20ASC%2065%2d370" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) ASC 65-370</a>,
Rolfe J referred to the often quoted and, if I may respectfully say so, the
helpful comments of Hunt J (as he then was) in <b><u>Singer v Statutory and
Other Officers Remuneration Tribunal</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20633" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 633</a> and those of
Simpson J in <b><u>Archcom Pty Limited v Consumer Claims Tribunal &amp;
Ors</u></b> (NSWSC, 29 September 1995, unreported) which deal with the nature
of the proceedings in the Consumer Claims Tribunal.  
<P>

9  	The Tribunal has been established to deal with small claims in a
relatively informal and expeditious manner.  As Hunt J said
in
<b><u>Singer</u></b> at p 635:
<P>

<b>"The Consumer Tribunal Act 1974 has set up a system for the speedy and
inexpensive disposal of certain claims, limited in amount,
arising out of
contracts for the supply of goods or the provision of services by a person
carrying on (or holding himself out as
carrying on) the business of supplying
such goods or providing such services.  The tribunal hearing such claims is
constituted by
a referee, who need not have (and who in many cases does not
have) legal qualification."</b>
<P>

<u>10  	</u>As Simpson J said in <b><u>Archcom</u></b> at p 12 after
referring to the remarks of Hunt J:
<P>

<b>"Those remarks were made in the context of the predecessor of the Act, a
1974 Act by the same title, but they apply equally to the
Act.  Underpinning
the Act is a policy of providing expeditious access to an inexpensive and
informal process for the resolution
of consumer disputes involving relatively
small amounts of money.  Speed and economy are to be accompanied and (it is
hoped) often
achieved, by informality."</b>
<P>

11  	Her Honour continued, at pp 13-14:
<P>

<b>"The intention of the legislature, in creating these tribunals as a forum
for the resolution of disputes involving relatively small
amounts of money was
the achievement of expeditious and inexpensive justice between the parties
while maintaining a proper regard
for, and protection of, the rights of the
parties to the dispute.  The difficulty, as I see it, lies in striking the
correct balance
between those two goals.  Speedy and inexpensive solutions may
be inimicable to the protection of rights.  There is no necessary
relationship
between the factual or legal complexity and the quantum of a claim but legal
rights and obligations remain at the heart
of the tribunal's jurisdiction.
Although a tribunal is enjoined to make such orders as will, in its opinion, be
fair and equitable
to all parties to the claim (s 31(1)), those orders must be
grounded in legal liability."</b>
<P>

12  	Her Honour thus stressed the need for "justice" and the
"protection of rights".
<P>

13  	In relation to natural justice, Professor S A de Smith,
<b>Judicial Review of Administrative Act</b>, 2nd ed., pp 180-181 has stated:

<P>

<b>"Natural justice generally required that persons liable to be directly
affected by proposed administrative acts, decisions or proceedings
be given
adequate notice of what is proposed, so that they may be in a position:  (a) to
make representations on their own behalf;
 or (b) to appear at a hearing or
inquiry (if one is to be held);  and (c) effectively to prepare their own case
and to answer the
case (if any) they have to meet."</b>
<P>

14  	In <b><u>Kioa v West</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1985/81.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1985] HCA 81</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%20159%20CLR%20550" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 159 CLR 550</a> the High Court
held that the duty to accord natural justice is a duty to act fairly.  In the
normal course, a party to judicial proceedings
(as are those in a tribunal)
could expect to be apprised of the nature of the case sought to be made against
it, and of the date
and time fixed for hearing such as to give it a reasonable
opportunity to meet that case and to advance its own.  These statements
are
similar to those expressed by Professor de Smith and referred to earlier.
Brennan J (as he then was) at p 628 stated:
<P>

<b>"A person whose interests are likely to be affected by an exercise of power
must be given an opportunity to deal with relevant matters
adverse to his
interest which the repository of the power proposes to take into account in
deciding upon its exercise."</b>
<P>

15  	In relation to procedural fairness, Mason J stated in
<b><u>Kioa</u></b> that the law had now developed to a point where it may be
accepted that there is a common law duty to act fairly, in the sense of
according procedural fairness, in the making of administrative decisions which
affect the rights, interests and legitimate expectations,
subject only to the
clear manifestation of a contrary statutory intention.  Procedural fairness is
a notion of a flexible obligation
to adopt fair procedures which are
appropriate and adapted to the circumstances of the particular case (pp 454 and
455).
<P>

16  	The plaintiff referred to <b><u>Davies v Paggett</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1986/106.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] FCA 106</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2010%20FCR%20226" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986)
10 FCR 226</a> and <b><u>Cohen v McWilliam</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2038%20NSWLR%20476" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 38 NSWLR 476</a> which
involve the considerations that apply to the setting aside of a default
judgment.  In <b><u>Cohen</u></b> Priestley JA stated:
<P>

<b>"...The fundamental duty of the court is to do justice between the parties.
It is, in turn, fundamental to that duty that the parties
should each be
allowed a proper opportunity to put their cases upon the merits of the matter.
Any limitation upon that opportunity
will generally be justified only on the
necessity to avoid prejudice to the interests of some other party, occasioned
by misconduct."</b>
<P>

17  	The parties agreed that the passage quoted above sets out the
rules of natural justice at common law.
<P>

18  	However, the third defendant submitted that the legislation
namely <b>Consumer Claims Tribunal Act</b> 1987 has modified the common law
rules of natural justice.
<P>

19  	On 1 March 1999 the <b>Consumer Claims Tribunal Act</b> 1987 was
repealed by the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1998172/" class="autolink_findacts">Consumer Claims Act</a></b> 1998.  The <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1998172/" class="autolink_findacts">Consumer Claims
Act</a></b> 1998 commenced on 1 March 1999.  By virtue of Schedule 1 to the
<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1998172/" class="autolink_findacts">Consumer Claims Act</a></b> 1998, the <b>Consumer Claims Tribunal Act</b> 1987
applied to matters that had not been finally determined by the Consumer Claims
Tribunal.
<P>

20  	A number of further provisions of the Act are relevant.  Section
14 provides that the registrar of the Tribunal must when the
initial hearing is
deferred, cause notice of the time and place fixed for hearing to be served on
all interested parties - s 14(1)(d)
and (7).  Section 20 empowers the Tribunal
to adjourn the case from time to time and if the matter is adjourned, the
registrar must
cause notice of the time and place fixed for hearing to be
served on the parties - s 20(2).  Section 40 provides that it is sufficient
for
service of notices under the Act, that the notice be posted by pre-paid mail to
the person's usual or last known address.  It
is common ground that the
Tribunal complied with the notice requirements and the plaintiff received those
notices.
<P>

21  	Section 17(1) provides that except as expressly provided by the
Act and regulations, the Tribunal in exercising its functions,
must conform to
the rules of natural justice.  Section 21(1) provides that subject to the
section, a party has the carriage of the
party's case.  Section 21(2) provides
that a party is not entitled to be represented unless the party is a
corporation and it is
represented by one of its officers - subsection (a);  or
the tribunal decides that a party would be disadvantaged if not represented
-
subsection (j);  or in any other case, representation is approved by the
tribunal - subsection (k).
<P>

22  	Section 24(1) provides:
<P>

<b>"(1)	Subject to s 25, if at the hearing of a consumer claim by a tribunal
the case of a party to a claim is not represented to the
tribunal:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	the tribunal must decide the issues in dispute on such evidence as is
otherwise adduced before it, and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	an order made by the tribunal to determine the claim is just as
effective as if that party had been fully heard."</b>
<P>

23  	Thus if a party to the claim does not present a case to the
Tribunal, the Tribunal must decide the issues in dispute upon the
evidence
before it.  Section 25 provides for the rehearing of a consumer claim if the
registrar is satisfied that there was sufficient
reason for the party's
absence.
<P>

24  	The most relevant authority is the Court of Appeal decision of
<b><u>McClelland v Acmil Industries Pty Limited</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%201%20NSWLR%20615" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 1 NSWLR 615.</a>  It
involved a hearing before the Consumer Claims Tribunal under the <b>Consumer
Claims Tribunal Act</b> 1974.  Approximately 14 days before the hearing, the
registrar of the Tribunal gave notice of the hearing, by post to the
respondent.
 The notice was received at the address at which the respondent
carried on business (as opposed to its principal office which was
elsewhere) on
the day before the hearing but was not received by the responsible officer
until the day after the hearing.  The Court
of Appeal held that in these
circumstances there was no denial of natural justice.  Reference was made in
the judgments to ss 14(1)(b),
34 and 37 of the 1974 Act (these provisions have
materially similar counterparts in the Act being ss 14(1)(d) and (7), 17(1) and
s 40).
<P>

25  	Hope JA stated at p 617:
<P>

<b>"In my opinion there is no basis in the terms of the legislation, which is
essentially directed to the setting up of a fairly peremptory
system of dealing
with small claims, to construe the Act so as to require that a notice given by
the registrar pursuant to s14(1)(b)
should be received at a time which would
enable the recipient to prepare his case for hearing.</b>
<P>

<b>...the Act is not to be construed to require that a notice is to be given at
a time which will take into account the internal arrangements
of the recipient.
The notice... is a notice which is effective when it is received;...</b>
<P>

<b>...the requirement that the tribunal have regard, in the control of its
procedures and the exercise of that control, to natural justice
is subject to
the Act and regulations. The Act requires the registrar to give a notice of the
hearing and authorizes the service
of that notice by post.</b>
<P>

<b>The notice is deemed to be sufficient if posted in accordance with the
provisions of s 37. If a notice is served in accordance with
the provisions of
s 37 and</b>
<P>

<b>...is received at a time which would give an opportunity to the respondent
to attend at the hearing before the tribunal, if acted
upon at the time of
receipt, there is, ...no basis, whether by the application of s34 or otherwise,
to deny the validity of the ensuing
proceedings by reason of the time or manner
of the service of the notice."</b>
<P>

26  	Hutley JA commented that the provisions of the <b>Consumer
Claims Tribunal Act</b> 1974 are designed to see that natural justice has very
little role to play.  Furthermore, the Tribunal itself cannot give effect
to
its ideas of natural justice because it is only subject to the Act and
regulations that it can exercise control on the bases of
natural justice.
However, although it is true that there is provision for the court intervening
under circumstances disclosing absence
of natural justice, the occasions on
which it will be able to intervene will be limited.
<P>

27  	Mr Lewin who was to appear on behalf of the plaintiff before the
tribunal was ill.  Although he was able to attend a doctor
the day before the
hearing he did not cause a copy of this medical certificate to be faxed to the
Tribunal to alert it that he would
require an adjournment prior to the hearing.
He has not provided an explanation as to why this did not occur.  The case of
the plaintiff
was not presented to the Tribunal nor had the Tribunal received
notification that Mr Lewin a representative of Lew's Discount Carpet
Pty
Limited intended to appear but was ill.  The Tribunal acted consistently with s
24(1) and decided the issues in dispute on the
evidence adduced before it.  It
did not accept the whole of Browseabout's claim and reduced it by $1,810.
<P>

28  	The plaintiff's application for a rehearing was made about one
month after the claim had been heard.  It is accepted that the
plaintiff
suffered a severe upper respiratory infection one day prior to the hearing but
the plaintiff has perhaps overstated the
level of disabilities brought about by
the infection in that he was bed ridden for about one month.  The plaintiff was
forwarded
a notice of rehearing in accordance with s 25.  There is no evidence
as to whether the plaintiff appeared at the rehearing and whether
any further
submissions or representations were made to it. The plaintiff has not
demonstrated that the Tribunal did other than comply
with s 25.  
<P>

29  	As was stated by Hutley J even if the circumstances disclose an
absence of natural justice the occasions on which the court
can intervene are
limited.  In this case, the court should not intervene.  The plaintiff may have
been treated harshly.  However
as the Tribunal complied with the requirements
of the <b>Consumer Claims Tribunal Act</b> there has not been a denial of the
rules of natural justice.  The plaintiff's claim must fail.  Accordingly, the
notice of motion
and summons are dismissed.  Costs are to follow the event.
The plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs.
<P>

30  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The Minister of Fair Trading be added as fourth defendant.
<P>

(2)	The notice of motion filed 18 May 1999 is dismissed.
<P>

(3)	The amended summons is dismissed.
<P>

(4)	The plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs.
<P>

(5)	The plaintiff is to pay the costs of Minister for Fair Trading.
<P>

(6)	The moneys held by either the Sheriff or the court be paid out to the first
defendant's solicitors Kennedy &amp; Cooke, DX 4892
Batemans Bay.
<P>

(7)	The stay of execution be removed.
