<b><u>2625/96 HUGH JENNER WILY in his capacity as Liquidator of AUR NL (IN
LIQUIDATION), AUR NL (IN LIQUIDATION) v RAL AUSTRALIA</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT on application to amend</b>
<P>

1   	By notice of motion filed in court on 24 August 1999 the
plaintiff seeks leave to amend the statement of claim.  
<P>

2   	It is necessary to give some short history.  By the
original statement of claim the liquidator sought to set aside a particular
transaction which took place on 3 July 1990 as being void against the
liquidator pursuant to s368 of the Companies (New South Wales)
Code as a
transaction occurring after the commencement of the winding up of AUR NL (In
Liquidation), that commencement being some
time on 3 July 1990, when the
summons for winding up was filed.  The allegation in the statement of claim
that this transaction took
place after the commencement of the winding up was
not admitted by the defendant in it defence.  No attention was directed to this
matter during the hearing and no evidence was adduced to establish that the
impugned transaction took place after the commencement
of the winding up.
Neither counsel addressed this matter during closing submissions.  When I was
preparing my judgment I realised
that there was no evidence which would
establish the impugned transaction took place after the commencement of the
winding up.  I
decided it was appropriate to relist the matter to ascertain
whether or not this matter was really in issue because counsel for the
defendant had never argued that the defendant must succeed because the
plaintiff had not made out the pleaded case.  The matter was
relisted on 17
August when counsel for the defendant informed me that there was no admission
and claimed that on that basis alone
the defendant was entitled to succeed on
this particular claim.  While there can be no doubt that no argument was
addressed to this
matter, in my view that does not preclude the defendant from
relying upon failure by the plaintiff to prove its pleaded case, that
being the
point of pleadings, unless there is some indication or some statement made that
a particular matter is not in issue.  It
is for the party presenting a case to
obtain any admission necessary or to prove the facts necessary to entitle it to
the relief
sought.
<P>

3   	There was no application for amendment on 17 August but
shortly thereafter the plaintiff filed the notice of motion the subject
of
these reasons which on the return day on 24 August was stood over until 31
August.  The amendment then propounded by the plaintiff
was to put forward an
alternative claim, alleging that the transaction took place prior to the
commencement of the winding up but
was void against the liquidator as a
preference.  On 24 August, when the notice of motion was first returnable it
was stated that
there would be no application to adduce any additional
evidence.  The position then was on the pleading sought to be propounded that
there were alternative claims and no evidence of the facts necessary to
establish the claim one way or the other, namely whether
the impugned
transaction took place before or after the commencement of the winding up,
although it was established the transactions
took place on the same day.  
<P>

4   	After some discussion on 31 August it was accepted by
counsel for the plaintiff that if an amendment were to be made it would
require
further redrafting.  To avoid any further delay it was agreed that the
plaintiff would prepare a new form of amended statement
of claim, which would
be deemed to be the document covered by the notice of motion and the defendant
would prepare a defence to that
document, and that both documents would be sent
to me and marked as exhibits and I would prepare my judgment on the basis that
the
claim the plaintiff was making was to amend the statement of claim in
accordance with the document which became an exhibit.  In those
circumstances I
have marked the amended statement of claim as Exhibit Y and the proposed
defence to that document as Exhibit Z. 
It was agreed that whether or not I
allowed the amendment I should proceed to judgment in the substantive
proceedings immediately
upon determining the fate of the application for
amendment.  In other words there was to be no further evidence and no further
argument.
<P>

5   	The amendment sought to be made so far as is relevant
pleads first that the transaction took place after the commencement of
the
winding up; second and in the alternative, that it took place prior to the
commencement of the winding up and is void as a preference
and thirdly, in the
further alternative, that it took place on 3 July 1990 and whether occurring
before or after the commencement
of the winding up was void against the
liquidator.
<P>

6   	The question now is whether the amendment should be
allowed.  The impugned transaction took place on any basis on 3 July 1990.
These proceedings were commenced by statement of claim filed on 2 July 1996, in
other words one day before the limitation period
expired.  It follows that if
the court is to allow the amendment, exercising its discretion in favour of the
plaintiff, it does so
in the circumstances where the amendment is sought after
conclusion of the hearing and because I sought clarification as to whether
there had been some concession, and secondly in circumstances where if the
amendment were not allowed any claim would be barred by
time, thus bringing
into account the provisions of Pt 20 r4(5) and of course the general power of
amendment under Pt 20 r1.
<P>

7   	With some hesitation I have concluded that the amendment
ought to be allowed.  Although it is an amendment sought in the face
of what
would otherwise be defeat, it is I think clear and accepted that the plaintiff
cannot establish on the evidence whether the
impugned transaction took place
before or after the commencement of the winding up, and neither can the court
determine this on any
probability basis on the evidence before it.  I should
say that I find this position most extraordinary because I have little doubt
that access to the file in the winding up proceedings and access to records
relating to the impugned transaction could establish
which took place first.
The plaintiff for whatever reason, and possibly to increase the chance of
obtaining the amendment sought,
has eschewed the opportunity to seek leave to
adduce additional evidence.  It follows from this that the defendant is not
prejudiced
through being unable to obtain evidence one way or the other.  It
further follows that it is only if the plaintiff's claim that it
is entitled to
recoup the moneys whether or not the transaction took place before or after the
commencement of the winding up that
is of real significance in dealing with the
amendments sought.  There is, of course, substantial prejudice to any party
entitled
to win on the pleadings as they stand being faced with an amendment
which might give the plaintiff a possibility of success.  On
the other hand it
does seem to me that the case falls within Pt 20 r4(5) because the facts are
substantially the same, the only difference
being a question of timing on a
particular day.  I also consider that some attention should be given to the
fact that counsel for
the defendant addressed no argument to the lack of proof,
perhaps because it escaped his attention or perhaps because he decided
to leave
it to me and hope I picked it up.  Parties who leave matters to chance in that
way are, I think, more susceptible to a court
allowing an amendment and I
propose do so.
<P>

8   	The orders are as follows
<P>

1.	Give leave to the plaintiffs to amend the statement of claim by filing a
document in the form of Exhibit Y.
<P>

2.	Order that Exhibit Y be deemed to be filed and stand as the amended
statement of claim.
<P>

3.	Order that Exhibit Z deemed to be filed and stand as the defence to the
amended statement of claim.
<P>

4.	Order the plaintiffs to pay the defendant's costs of the notice of
motion.
