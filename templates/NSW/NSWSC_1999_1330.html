<P>

<b><u>EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT - On admissibility of MFI 32; see page 1305 of
transcript.</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

1  	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:  At this stage the defendants seek to tender
mfi 32, which is a facsimile transmission from Mr Kalantzis, an in-house legal
counsel
for the defendants, to Mr Greg Prowse, a partner of Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu.  The transmission includes a copy of a letter dated
1 December 1997
from Mr Kalantzis to a partner of Mallesons Stephen Jaques, the solicitors for
the plaintiffs, containing further
particulars of the Lange defence embraced by
paragraph 8(a), (Particulars of Common Law Qualified Privilege) in the then
defence,
and particulars of justification of the then imputation in paragraph
7(a) of the then Statement of Claim, though that imputation
has since been
amended and it is not sought, in its amended form, to be justified.  The letter
also refers to other pleaded imputations
which are sought to be justified, and
one imputation which by order of Levine J was struck out.  Annexed to the
letter are particulars
of truth of imputation 7(a) to which I have already
referred, imputation 7(b) which is not now sought to be justified, and
imputations
7(c), 7(d) and 7(e).
<P>

2  	During the course of Mr Prowse's evidence he was cross-examined
by Mr Hughes QC for the plaintiffs to suggest that he sought,
on more than one
occasion, if I am correct, additional information from the solicitors for the
defendants which was not made available
to him.  One can reasonably apprehend
that there will be submissions put to the jury by senior counsel for the
plaintiffs in that
regard.  Mr Littlemore for the defendants has submitted to
me that it is open to the defendants to put before the jury the particulars
contained in MFI 32 because, at page 849 of the transcript (during
re-examination) in answer to the question, "Is that the document
to which you
referred in your letter of 8 December when you said `I have read the
particulars of truth'", Mr Prowse said, "Yes, it
is."  The document was then
marked for identification 32, and no further evidence was led in re-examination
on that issue.
<P>

3  	Mr Littlemore submits that it is most important that the jury be
made aware by perusal of MFI 32 of Mr Prowse's instructions
and upon what
material he was asked to express an opinion and, indeed, there is evidence
before the jury that he had been supplied
with the particulars of truth and
obviously had given consideration to them.
<P>

4  	I must say that I am at this stage far from convinced that the
tender of the particulars would be relevant to the evidence that
Mr Prowse has
given.  However, apart from that situation, the fact is that if this material
were to be presented to the jury it would
include allegations in relation to
matters which have never found their way into evidence.  It is a
well-established principle that
experts,  and there is no doubt that Mr Prowse
is an expert, are only permitted to express views upon material which is in
evidence
before the jury.  Thus it would offend that principle, in my view, if
material were now placed before the jury which was in fact
never adduced in
evidence.
<P>

5  	Mr Littlemore has contended that I should not be deterred in
ruling upon this matter by the fact that the jury would require
most detailed
directions in relation to how they could use this material, and that would
include the necessity to put out of their
mind material that did not find its
way into evidence.  Also, some detailed explanation would be required in
relation to the identified
imputations which either no longer exist in their
precise form or in respect of which justification is not now sought.  Thus,
even
if I were wrong on the relevance point of view, I would exercise my
discretion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s135</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a></u> specifically on the basis that
the tender of this evidence at this stage might be unfairly prejudicial to the
plaintiffs or misleading
or confusing to the jury.
<P>

6  	For those reasons I reject the tender of MFI 32.
