COURTS - JURISDICTION - CROSS-VESTING; ESTOPPEL - ISSUE ESTOPPEL.  Proceedings
were brought in the Industrial Commission and in
the Federal Court, both based
on the acceptance of employment in reliance on misleading representations.
After significant procedural
steps in the Commission, the defendant applied to
transfer the IRC proceedings to the Supreme Court.  HELD that the specialist
expertise
of the IRC, determination of substantial issues by the IRC, and
delay, were factors against transfer; that the question was whether
these
factors were outweighed by the justice and convenience of avoiding multiplicity
of proceedings; that this in turn depended
on the likely effect of issue
estoppels; that the Federal Court proceedings were unlikely to be significantly
shortened by issue
estoppels arising from the IRC proceedings; and that
transfer should be ordered.

<P>

<b><u>MACQUARIE BANK LIMITED   V.   BELL &amp; ANOR.</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	By its summons in these proceedings filed on 23rd April 1999, the
plaintiff (which I will call "Macquarie") seeks an order that
proceedings
No.6793 of 1997 and No.6794 of 1997 in the Industrial Relations Commission of
NSW be removed to this Court pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.8</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts
(Cross-Vesting) Act 1987</a>.  Those proceedings were brought respectively by the
first defendant Mr. Bell and the second defendant Mr. Berg against Macquarie,
and also against a Hong Kong company Macquarie International Capital Markets
Limited (which I will call "Macquarie International");
but for reasons which
will appear below, removal is sought of the proceedings only in so far as they
concern Macquarie.
<P>

2  	The summons also sought removal to this Court of proceedings
No.NG1042 of 1997 in the Federal Court of Australia, being proceedings
brought
by Messrs. Bell and Berg against Macquarie and Macquarie International.
However, it is plain that this Court cannot make
such an order.
<P>

<b><u>HISTORY</u></b>
<P>

3  	I will begin with a brief outline of the history of those other
proceedings.
<P>

4  	On 5th December 1997, Messrs. Bell and Berg filed an Application
and Statement of Claim in the Federal Court.  In short, they
claimed damages
and/or an account of profits on the basis that Macquarie had made a series of
representations to them as to the benefits
they would receive from a business
venture in Asia, in reliance on which they first accepted and later continued
in employment with
Macquarie and Macquarie International; that this employment
came to an end without their receiving those benefits; that the conduct
of
Macquarie was misleading and deceptive and caused loss; and that Macquarie and
Macquarie International acted unconscionably in
appropriating for their own
benefit the confidential information, knowledge and experience of Messrs. Bell
and Berg.  
<P>

5  	On 9th December 1997, Mr. Bell and Mr. Berg each filed a summons
in the Industrial Relations Commission seeking declarations
that the contracts
and/or arrangements between each applicant and Macquarie and Macquarie
International were unfair, harsh and unconscionable;
orders varying such
contracts and/or arrangements; and orders for the payment of money ($20.1
million for Mr. Bell, $12.5 million
for Mr. Berg).  The grounds were
essentially the representations and non-receipt of benefits alleged in the
Federal Court proceedings.
<P>

6  	On 19th February 1998, Macquarie and Macquarie International
filed a Notice of Motion in the Industrial Relations Commission
seeking orders
setting aside or staying the proceedings as an abuse of process, and a
declaration that the Industrial Relations Commission
had no jurisdiction in
respect of Macquarie International.  
<P>

7  	On 15th May 1998, Lehane, J. in the Federal Court heard a motion
by Messrs. Bell and Berg seeking an adjournment of the proceedings
either until
final determination of the Industrial Relations Commission proceedings, or for
six months.  Lehane, J. held that it
was appropriate that the Industrial
Relations Commission proceedings be heard and determined first, and he stood
the Federal Court
proceedings over to 27th November 1998.  The proceedings have
since then been further stood over by consent.  
<P>

8  	On 26th June 1998, there was a contested hearing before Marks, J.
in the Industrial Relations Commission, in which there was
argument as to
whether the Industrial Relations Commission proceedings were an abuse of
process, and as to whether a question of
territorial jurisdiction in relation
to Macquarie International should be the subject of a preliminary hearing.
Marks, J. gave judgment
on those matters on 17th August 1998, deciding that the
Industrial Relations Commission proceedings were not an abuse of process,
but
that there should be a preliminary hearing as to territorial jurisdiction; and
that in such a hearing, the applicants should
have the onus of proof on the
balance of probabilities.  
<P>

9  	On 10th September 1998, Messrs. Bell and Berg filed an
application for leave to appeal and a Notice of Appeal to the Full Bench
of the
Industrial Relations Commission, against the decision of Marks, J. on the
question of the preliminary hearing concerning territorial
jurisdiction.  That
matter was heard by the Full Bench on 13th November 1998.  
<P>

10  	It appears that on 18th February 1999, the solicitors for
Macquarie became aware, for the first time, of my decision in <u>Bruning v.
Kingsmill (Australia) Pty. Limited</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%20180" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 44 NSWLR 180</a>, to the effect that
where there were overlapping proceedings in the Industrial Relations Commission
(for relief under s.106 of the
Industrial Relations Act) and the Federal Court
(for relief inter alia under the Trade Practices Act), this Court could remove
the
Industrial Relations Commission proceedings to the Supreme Court , in
anticipation of the Federal Court proceedings being likewise
removed to the
Supreme Court, following which the Supreme Court could hear and determine both
sets of proceedings.  It appears that,
until that time, Macquarie's solicitors
had considered that this could not be done; and it appears from submissions by
Senior Counsel
for Messrs. Bell and Berg before Lehane, J., that this view was
shared by their solicitors also.  
<P>

11  	On 12th March 1999, the Full Bench granted leave to appeal and
upheld the appeal from Marks, J.  The Full Bench held that,
if there was to be
a preliminary hearing concerning jurisdiction, it could only be dealt with as a
strike-out point, with the onus
squarely on the respondent.  However, the Full
Bench noted that there was a question as to whether each applicant should have
leave
to proceed against Macquarie International, as a party which had entered
a conditional appearance and was contending that the Court
had no jurisdiction.
The Full Bench ordered that Marks, J. determine jurisdictional and other
procedural questions, and undertake
the conciliation required by s.109 of the
Industrial Relations Act.  
<P>

12  	By letter dated 29th March 1999, Macquarie's solicitors invited
Messrs. Bell and Berg's solicitors to consent to having the
proceedings in both
courts removed to the Supreme Court.  This invitation was refused by a letter
dated 13th April 1999.  The solicitors
for Messrs. Bell and Berg pointed out
that the preparation of the case in the Industrial Relations Commission was
well advanced;
and that the best way to minimise legal costs was to advance
those proceedings quickly to conciliation and/or trial.  This application
was
then brought on 23rd April.  
<P>

13  	On 17th June 1999, there was a contested hearing before Marks,
J. in the Industrial Relations Commission as to whether Macquarie
International
had been served within the jurisdiction, and if not, whether the applicants
should have leave to proceed.  On 9th July
1999, Marks, J. gave his decision,
against Messrs. Bell and Berg on both points.  
<P>

14  	On 28th July 1999, an appeal was lodged against that decision,
and that appeal is to be heard on 22nd November 1999.  
<P>

15  	The hearing before me took place on 25th August 1999.
<P>

<b><u>SUBMISSIONS</u></b>
<P>

16  	Mr. Collins QC for Macquarie provided written submissions which
I will leave with the papers.  These submissions suggested
there would be much
saving of expense and inconvenience if the two sets of proceedings were
effectively consolidated.  There would
be overseas witnesses.  There would be
complicated evidence as to the financial prospects of joint venture projects in
Asia, which
would involve evidence as to the effect on those proposals of the
Asian economic crisis.  If the matters were dealt with separately,
awkward
questions of issue estoppel were likely to arise.  The overall dispute was an
appropriate one for the Supreme Court.  Multiplicity
of proceedings should be
avoided.  
<P>

17  	Mr. Hall QC for Messrs. Bell and Berg submitted that, as a
practical matter, the Industrial Relations Commission proceedings
would either
finalise the dispute, or greatly limit the issues to be determined in the
Federal Court proceedings.  The orders in
the Industrial Relations Commission
were sought on the basis of the same alleged misrepresentations and actions in
reliance as were
the basis of the Federal Court proceedings; so that the
decision in the Industrial Relations Commission would, at the very least,
greatly reduce the areas for dispute in the Federal Court.  Mr. Hall referred
me to <u>Hibbert v. Lubidineuse</u>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2037%20IR%20150" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 37 IR 150</a>, and <u>Sterling
Pharmaceuticals Pty. Limited v. Boots Company (Australia) Pty. Limited</u>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1992/72.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] FCA 72</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2034%20FCR%20287" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 34 FCR 287.</a>  
<P>

18  	Next, Mr. Hall submitted that there had been inordinate delay in
making this application, from December 1997 to April 1999.
 There had been very
substantial contests in both the Industrial Relations Commission and the
Federal Court, with costs being incurred,
with no suggestion from Macquarie
that an application such as this was to be made.  Even after Macquarie's
solicitors learnt of the
decision in <u>Bruning</u>, they waited until after an
adverse appeal decision before raising the question of cross-vesting:  in those
circumstances, this could
be seen as a case of forum shopping.  
<P>

19  	Mr. Hall submitted that I should not follow my previous decision
in <u>Bruning</u>, or the decisions following it in <u>Minproc Limited v.
Killinger</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/564.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWSC 564</a> and <u>Heath v. Hanning</u>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/719.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) NSWSC 719.</a>
He submitted that, in any event, this case was different from those cases, in
that there was no consent, as in <u>Bruning</u>; while the other matters were
cases where the proceedings in the different jurisdictions were initiated by
different parties.  
<P>

20  	Finally, Mr. Hall submitted that the Industrial Relations
Commission was the appropriate court to hear proceedings under s.106.
 It had
specialist expertise, and this was particularly important in relation to the
exercise of jurisdiction concerning employees
seconded overseas.  Furthermore,
s.106 required in substance the exercise of arbitral power, rather than an
ordinary judicial function.
 
<P>

<b><u>DECISION</u></b>
<P>

21  	In my opinion, I should follow <u>Bruning</u> and the other two
cases following it, and hold that this Court has jurisdiction to order removal
of the Industrial Relations Commission
proceedings. 
<P>

22  	I accept, as submitted by Mr. Hall, that in exercising the
Court's discretion, weight should be given to the specialist expertise
of the
Industrial Relations Commission concerning applications under s.106.  However,
I think it is fair to say that this consideration
has somewhat less weight in
relation to claims of this size and nature, than in relation to claims more
directly related to industrial
relations, particularly claims which in one way
or another involve industrial awards.  
<P>

23  	I accept also, as submitted by Mr. Hall, that weight should be
given to the circumstances that there has been delay in making
this
application, that substantial issues have been fought and determined in the
other jurisdictions, and that substantial costs
have been incurred.  However,
there was no cross-examination of the plaintiff's solicitor, who put on an
affidavit, to suggest that
the delay from mid-February 1999, when the
solicitors learnt of the decision in <u>Bruning</u>, to 29th March 1999, when
cross-vesting was suggested, was in order to ascertain whether a favourable
decision was to be obtained
from the Industrial Relations Commission.  I do not
think I should infer from that delay that this is a case of forum shopping. 
In
my opinion, the belief of both sets of solicitors that transfer was not
available explains the delay to mid-February 1999; although
this does not
eliminate delay as a significant discretionary factor.
<P>

24  	In my opinion also, it is clear that there should be no
effective removal of the proceedings from the Industrial Relations
Commission
until the Full Bench has decided the appeal which has been brought to it; until
the s.109 conciliation procedure has been
completed; and until there has been
an order for transfer by the Federal Court of the proceedings before it.  This
could give rise
to further delay.
<P>

25  	In my opinion, the substantial question I have to decide is
whether the factors outlined above are or are not outweighed by
considerations
of justice and convenience in avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings.  
<P>

26  	If I could be confident that the proceedings in the Industrial
Relations Commission would either resolve the dispute entirely,
or as a
practical matter greatly limit the scope of the Federal Court proceedings, I
would incline against ordering removal.  However,
plainly Messrs. Bell and Berg
do not have confidence that the Industrial Relations Commission will entirely
resolve the dispute,
because the whole point of their bringing two sets of
proceedings is that, if they do not get what they want from the Industrial
Relations Commission proceedings, they will proceed with the Federal Court
proceedings.  In my opinion, I have to regard that as
a substantial
possibility.  The cases before the Industrial Relations Commission are cases
concerning claims totalling more than
$30 million, requiring a hearing time
estimated at about three weeks by the applicants, or six to eight weeks by the
respondents,
and involving considerable complexity, particularly  on questions
of quantum; and unless the decision in the Industrial Relations
Commission
proceedings greatly limits the extent of subsequent Federal Court proceedings,
the hearing of those proceedings would
probably be of similar duration and
complexity.
<P>

27  	The question whether the extent of the Federal Court proceedings
would be so limited depends very much on how the principles
of issue estoppel
would operate.  In <u>Heath</u> at paragraphs 39-42, Austin, J. discussed
awkward questions of issue estoppel that could arise in the proceedings that he
was considering.
 Mr. Hall submitted that such awkward questions would not
arise in this case, because the issues in both sets of proceedings were
so
similar.  
<P>

28  	However, it is necessary to consider what the situation will be
if Messrs. Bell and Berg do not get the result they want from
the Industrial
Relations Commission.  This may happen because of factual findings about the
alleged representations or their truth,
or about reliance, or about the
benefits actually received, or about causation, or about quantum of loss; or
because the Industrial
Relations Commission considers the facts as found do not
justify a variation of the agreements and/or arrangements (or sufficient
variation) or the payment of money (or sufficient payment).  
<P>

29  	Now issue estoppel will arise only as to "the point actually
decided" and "matters which were necessary to decide and were
actually decided
as the groundwork of the decision itself though not then directly the point at
issue":  <u>R. v. Hartington Middle Quarter Inhabitants</u> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1855/264.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1855] EngR 264</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281855%29%204%20E%20%26%20B%20780" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1855) 4 E&amp;B
780</a> at 794; <u>Blair v. Curren</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1939/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1939] HCA 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281939%29%2062%20CLR%20464" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1939) 62 CLR 464</a> at 510.  As Dixon, J. said
in <u>Blair</u> at p.532:  "Findings, however deliberate and formal, which
concern only evidentiary facts and not ultimate facts forming the very
title to
rights give rise to no preclusion"  These matters are discussed at paragraphs
202 and 205 in Spencer Bower &amp; Handley,
<u>Res Judicata</u> (3rd. Ed.
1996):
<P>

<b><i>202.	"The difficulty in the actual application of these conceptions",
continued Dixon, J., [at p.533 in </i><cite>Blair</cite><i>] "is to distinguish
the matters fundamental or cardinal to the prior decision or judgment, or
necessarily involved in it as its legal
justification or foundation, from
matters which, even though actually raised and decided as being in the
circumstances of the case
the determining considerations, yet are not in point
of law the essential foundation or groundwork of the judgment".  In order to
make this distinction one has to inquire whether the determination was so
fundamental to the decision that the latter cannot stand
without it.  Even
where this condition is met, it is suggested by Dixon J that there is another
test to pass, viz. Whether the determination
is the "immediate foundation" of
the decision or merely "a proposition collateral or subsidiary only, i.e. no
more than part of the
reasoning supporting the conclusion".  A mere step in the
reasoning is insufficient.  What is required is a determination fundamental
to
the decision.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>One test which has been suggested is:  was it possible to appeal against
the determination?  This will not decide the question in
all cases; but is
often a useful test.  There are many determinations which cannot effectively be
challenged on appeal.  If there
can be no effective appeal against a particular
determination it is not fundamental to the judgment.  But this is not the only
test;
the inquiry must always be - is the determination such that without it
the judgment cannot stand?</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>...</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>205	A decision of fact or law against the party who succeeded will not
found an estoppel because it cannot be fundamental to the decision.
 It would
be unjust to make such a decision the foundation of an estoppel, for no appeal
is available to the person against whom
it was given.  A similar argument
applies where several factual grounds are advanced as alternative bases for a
cause of action and
the court finds more than one in favour of the party who
succeeds.  No estoppel can be founded on any of the separate findings, for
the
party failing on such issues cannot appeal any of them separately.  To succeed
on appeal he must succeed on all the issues, and
if the finding on one is good,
this will be fatal.  There will be a cause of action estoppel, but the separate
issues will not ground
issue estoppels because none was fundamental to the
decision.</i></b>
<P>

30  	It is clear that, if the Industrial Relations Commission wholly
dismisses the applications of Messrs. Bell and Berg without
making findings of
fact against them, there will be no issue estoppel.  In particular, findings of
fact in their favour will not
bind Macquarie.  Even if there are findings of
fact made against them, there could be questions as to whether the point in
issue
was merely whether the agreements and/or arrangements were unfair, harsh
or unconscionable, whether the factual findings were necessary
to the decision
of that issue, and whether the findings were of evidentiary rather than
ultimate facts; and even if it were considered
that the findings were of
ultimate facts, there could be questions whether the findings were under a
description appropriate to be
conclusive in relation to the different issues
which would be before the Federal Court.  
<P>

31  	To elaborate on the last point, there could be findings as to
the making of representations.  The representations alleged in
this case are in
substance representations that Messrs. Bell and Berg would receive certain
benefits in certain circumstances.  It
is extremely unlikely that the
Industrial Relations Commission would find the exact words of conversations.
What would be found would
be the substance of the conversations; and what the
court considers to be the substance of the conversations will depend upon the
ultimate issues the court is considering.  The Commission might address the
question in terms of whether or not the representation
amounted to a legally
binding contract that the applicant have benefits X in circumstances Y; or a
promise short of a legally binding
contract that the applicant would have
benefits X in circumstances Y; or a representation that the applicant would get
a contract
in certain circumstances to receive benefits X in circumstances Y;
or a representation that the applicant would receive benefits
X in
circumstances Y; or a representation that the applicant would have a reasonable
prospect of receiving benefits X in circumstances
Y; and there are other
possible formulations.  There could also be variations as to what could be
considered the substance of the
benefits X and the circumstances Y, having
regard to the ultimate issues before the Commission.  
<P>

32  	Then, if the Commission made a finding about whether or not the
"representations" it found were untrue or misleading, it would
presumably do so
without the assistance of s.51A of the Trade Practices Act.  That section,
which would apply to the claims brought
in the Federal Court, is in the
following terms:
<P>

<b><i>51A(1)  For the purposes of this Division, where a corporation makes a
representation with respect to any future matter (including
the doing of, or
the refusing to do, any act) and the corporation does not have reasonable
grounds for making the representation,
the representation shall be taken to be
misleading.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(2)	For the purposes of the application of subsection (1) in relation to
a proceeding concerning a representation made by a corporation
with respect to
any future matter, the corporation shall, unless it adduces evidence to the
contrary, be deemed not to have had reasonable
grounds for making the
representation.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>(3)	Subsection (1) shall be deemed not to limit by implication the
meaning of a reference in this Division to a misleading representation,
a
representation that is misleading in a material particular or conduct that is
misleading or is likely or liable to mislead.</i></b>
<P>

33  	A finding by the Commission that a representation as to the
future was not misleading could plainly not preclude a contrary
finding in the
Federal Court, based on s.51A.  Also, the Commission could hold that a
representation was not made but that, even
if it had been made, it was not
proved to be misleading.  In those circumstances, the finding that the
representation was not made
would not be necessary for the adverse ultimate
decision, and could not ground an issue estoppel.
<P>

34  	In relation to matters of reliance, causation, and quantum, the
Commission could focus on aspects of those questions which
are not identical to
the aspects which would concern the Federal Court in relation to the issues
before it.  It seems to me that,
in all these matters, there is a very
substantial possibility of difficult and technical questions concerning
estoppel, and also
the strong possibility that even determinations of fact in
favour of a successful party before the Commission would not prevent the
matter
being substantially re-litigated before the Federal Court. 
<P>

35  	Similarly, if the Commission were to give some relief to Messrs.
Bell and Berg, which they consider to be inadequate, the same
kind of questions
could arise both in relation to matters found in their favour and in relation
to matters found against them.  
<P>

36  	Having regard to the scope and complexity of the allegations and
the amount of money apparently involved, I have no confidence
that the parties
would not seek, as far as possible, to re-litigate matters in the Federal
Court; and I believe that, if Messrs.
Bell and Berg are not satisfied with the
result in the Commission, the proceedings in the Federal Court would not be
substantially
shorter.  Indeed, they could well be longer and more complex.
<P>

37  	For those reasons, so long as Messrs. Bell and Berg want to have
the advantage of both sets of proceedings, the balance of
the considerations
favour the removal of both cases to the Supreme Court, if that can be achieved.
If they elected to discontinue
one or other of the sets of proceedings, the
position would be otherwise.  
<P>

38  	Accordingly, I propose to order the transfer of the Industrial
Relations Commission proceedings to the Supreme Court.  I would
stay that order
until the expiration of one week after all of the following have occurred,
namely the decision of the Full Bench
of the Industrial Relations Commission in
the appeal presently scheduled to be heard on 22nd November 1999; the
completion of the
conciliation process under s.109 of the Industrial Relations
Act; and an order by the Federal Court transferring the Federal Court
proceedings to the Supreme Court.  
<P>

39  	If during the stay Messrs. Bell and Berg decide to discontinue
one or other of the sets of proceedings, they may apply to have
this order
vacated.  
<P>

40  	At present, my tentative view is that the costs of this
application should be costs in the proceedings.  I will direct that,
when
transferred to the Supreme Court, the other proceedings are to be considered as
cross-claims in the present proceedings.
<P>
