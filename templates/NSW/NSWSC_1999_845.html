<b><u>11336/99 - MICHAEL PHILLIPS v NZI INSURANCE AUSTRALIA LIMITED</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	<b>HER HONOUR:</b>   This is an appeal brought pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 69</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Courts (Civil Claims) Act</a></b> 1970 in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/index.html#p51b" class="autolink_findacts">Pt
51B</a> of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b>.  The plaintiff commenced proceedings by
Statement of Claim in the Local Court at Bankstown seeking indemnity, pursuant
to the provisions
of a contract of comprehensive insurance, for damage to his
vehicle caused by a collision on 9 December 1997.  
<P>

2   	On 7 May 1999 the Magistrate gave judgment for the
defendant.  
<P>

3   	The plaintiff's grounds of appeal contend that the
Magistrate erred in law in the following respects:
<P>

(i)	he failed to construe the contract as a whole;
<P>

(ii)	he failed to construe the contract by reference to the <i>contra
proferentem </i>rule of construction;
<P>

(iii)	there was no evidence to support his finding that the driver of the motor
vehicle was not the spouse of the plaintiff.  
<P>

4   	Only grounds (i) and (ii) were pressed in submissions on
the hearing of the appeal.
<P>

5   	The plaintiff and the defendant entered into a contract of
insurance in respect of the plaintiff's motor vehicle registered
number UBT
509.  The contract was formed by the defendant's acceptance of a proposal form
duly completed by the plaintiff on 19th
April 1997 together with the payment of
the premium which was received by the defendant on 22nd April 1997. There is no
issue but
that the contract is contained in two documents; the policy and the
Schedule thereto (annexures "A" &amp; "C" to the statement of
Mr Gomez dated 1
February 1999).
<P>

6   	The policy was still on foot  on 9 December 1997. On that
date the vehicle, UBT 509, was involved in a collision and was assessed
to be a
total loss. At the time of the collision the vehicle was being driven by Ms
Michele Scholes, a person aged under 25 years.

<P>

7   	The plaintiff made a claim for indemnity under the policy.
The claim form stated that Ms Scholes was the driver of the vehicle.
She was
described as  being the plaintiff's "de facto".  Her stated purpose for using
the motor vehicle at the time of the collision
was that she was "going
shopping".
<P>

8   	The defendant contended that its contract with the
plaintiff did not expose it to liability in circumstances where the vehicle
was
being driven by a person under the age of 25 years. It refused to pay the
plaintiff's claim.
<P>

9   	The policy, a standard form printed booklet titled "Policy
Comprehensive  Motor Vehicle Insurance", is divided into eight `plain
English'
sections. The first two sections contain introductory material. Under the
heading "Our Agreement" the following appears:
<P>

We use information you give us to decide upon your premium and in return for
this premium, we will give <b>you </b>the protection described in this
Policy,
<P>

.....
<P>

In this Policy we show you (1) the extent of the cover and explain (2) what is
not covered in the clearest way possible. The first
is always subject to the
second.
<P>

Our agreement is made up of this Policy document and the <b>current
Schedule</b>, which contains the specific insurance details for <b>you</b>. <b>
</b>
<P>

10   	Other relevant portions of the policy relied upon by the
plaintiff are as set out below:
<P>

<b>A2 Drivers of your Car</b> 
<P>

<b>Your Current Schedule</b> shows the drivers which you selected for cover.
This means your Policy operates while these persons are driving <b>WITH YOUR
PERMISSION</b>.
<P>

	<b>Who is covered</b>
<P>

<b>One </b>of the following groups as shown on your current Schedule:-
<P>

&#183;	<b>Any driver</b>
<P>

&#183;	<b>Drivers aged 25 and over</b>
<P>

&#183;	<b>Drivers aged 25 and over plus named drivers</b>
<P>

<b>A3 Use of your Car</b>
<P>

<b>Your Current Schedule</b> shows the use of your car which you selected for
cover.  This means your Policy operates while your car is used for the purposes
shown <b>WITH YOUR PERMISSION</b>.
<P>

<b>What is covered</b>
<P>

<b>One</b> of the following groups as shown on your current Schedule:-
<P>

&#183;	<b>Home Use</b> - which means social, domestic and pleasure, but not
travel to and from work.
<P>

&#183;	<b>Private Use</b> - which means social, domestic and pleasure, plus
travel to and from work, plus personal use by you or your spouse for your
occupation(s).
<P>

&#183;	<b>Business Use</b> - which means Private plus business use by other
people eg. employees.
<P>

&#183;	<b>Farm Business</b> - which means business use as shown above, but only
for your business as a Primary Producer.
<P>

<b>E4 Excess</b>
<P>

The excess is a `first amount' which must be paid towards a claim for each
separate accident or event.
<P>

<b>How Much is the Excess?</b>
<P>

(a)	The `<b>Basic Excess</b>' shown on your current Schedule applies to every
claim.  To this amount is added the following if applicable:-
<P>

	
<P>

	`Convertible/Open Cars'
<P>

The `extra' amount below recognises higher risk for certain vehicle  types,
<b>without charging a higher premium</b>.
<P>

&#183;	$500 if your car has a convertible roof or open top, but only if the
claim includes loss or damage to the roof material or
anything inside the car.
However, this does not apply in the event of collision with another vehicle.
<P>

(b)	The `<b>Additional Excess</b>' shown on your current Schedule applies only
when your car is driven by a person under 25 years of age, licensed less than 2
years
in Australia or undergoing tuition.  However, this does not apply in the
event of window damage only, fire, theft or storm damage.
<P>

`Young &amp; Inexperienced Drivers
<P>

The total excess applicable to a claim is the sum of the Basic Excess and the
Additional Excess."
<P>

11   	The Schedule to the policy provided, inter alia: 
<P>

BASIC EXCESS:  applicable each and every claim                       $350
<P>

ADDITIONAL EXCESSES:  Aged 21 but under 25 years              $400
<P>

Aged under 21 or licensed less than 24 months 
<P>

or used for tuition
             $500
<P>

1 YEARS NO CLAIM BONUS ALLOWED
<P>

DRIVERS COVERED: CATEGORY B - DRIVERS AGED 25 AND OVER
<P>

USE COVERED: PRIVATE USE ONLY
<P>

12   	Both the policy and the Schedule were prepared by the
defendant.  The plaintiff submits that when the contract is read as
a whole it
is plain that there is an ambiguity.  Clause A2, when read in conjunction with
the Schedule, provides that the policy
only covers drivers aged 25 years and
over who are driving the vehicle with the permission of the insured.  However,
the Schedule
also includes details of the additional excess to be paid in
respect of drivers aged under 25 years. This is capable of suggesting
that
cover extends to drivers aged under 25 years subject to the payment of the
additional excess.  On the plaintiff's behalf it
was submitted:  
<P>

"No sensible construction of the contract would require the plaintiff to pay an
additional excess <u>and</u> let the defendant deny liability.  To construe the
contract in this way would make the provisions relating to excess inapplicable
and should be avoided".  
<P>

13   	The Magistrate reviewed each of the sections of the policy
upon which the plaintiff relies together with the terms of the
Schedule. He
concluded that there was no ambiguity. His Worship had regard to the terms of
the "private use" option set out in Part
A3 of the policy which was the cover
selected by the insured. The "private use" option includes "personal use by you
or your spouse
for your occupation(s)."  The magistrate considered that, in the
event that the insured's spouse was aged under 25 years, she would
be covered
under the policy in relation to her use of the subject vehicle (with the
permission of the insured) in connection with
her occupation.  In such an
instance the insured would be required to pay the additional excess in the
event of a claim.  Read in
this way the inclusion of the detail as to the
amount of the additional excess does not give rise to uncertainty when read in
conjunction
with the statement that the policy covers "category B - drivers
aged 25 and over". 
<P>

14   	The plaintiff submits that the Magistrate's finding in
this regard merely highlights a further ambiguity in the parties' contract.
 On
the face of it, so the plaintiff submits, the selection of a policy category B
"drivers aged 25 and over" is inconsistent with
cover extending to a spouse
aged less than 25 years within the terms of the private use option in clause
A3.  The plaintiff complains:
<P>

"Accordingly, his Worship found another example of an ambiguity and, instead of
recognising that, and construing the driver clause
<i>contra proferentem<b>
</b></i>in relation to other drivers under 25, limited his construction of the
additional excess clause to the situation where a spouse under
the age of 25
was driving."
<P>

15   	The plaintiff referred me to the decision of the court in
<b>MGICA Ltd v United City Merchants (Australia) Ltd</b> (1986) 4 ANZ Ins Cases
60-729 as authority for the proposition (1) that the policy, like any written
contract, must be read as a
whole, (2) that it being a contract of insurance
proffered by the insurer it should be construed <i>contra proferentem</i>.  
<P>

16   	The <i>contra proferentem</i> rule of construction was
explained by Isaacs ACJ in <b>Maye v Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1924/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1924] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281924%29%2035%20CLR%2014" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1924) 35 CLR 14</a> at 22:
<P>

"If by reason of its own language in relation to the matter, or by reason of
the context or of conflicting or differing provisions
elsewhere, a term when
fairly read is doubtful or ambiguous and reasonably susceptible of two
constructions, that construction should
be adopted which is the more favourable
to the assured, because that is of the two the more 
<P>

reasonable in the circumstances."
<P>

17   	I note that in <b>MGICA </b>Kirby P (as he then was, at
74,350)<b> </b> described the <i>contra proferentem</i> rule of construction as
a rule of last resort and a principle for construction to remove ambiguities
only when other more rational
approaches fail. The principle was of assistance
in the resolution of the issues raised by the terms of the contract in that
case.
Professor Sutton in his text <b>Insurance Law in Australia</b>, 2nd Ed.,
LBC, observes at para 9.64:  "The principle has been described as a rule of
last resort but it has been applied over and
over again to the situation where
an ambiguity has been found to exist in a provision formulated by an insurer
for his own protection".
 The principle recognises that it is the insurer who
prepares the contract and who ought to make its meaning clear by the use of
unambiguous language. The insured ought not to mislead into the belief that he
or she is covered for a risk if this is not the case.
 Ambiguities ought be
resolved by adopting the construction most favourable to the insured;
<b>Maye</b>; <b>Re an Arbitration, O'Brien &amp; South British Insurance Co.
Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1938%5d%20NZLR%20582" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1938] NZLR 582</a> at 591; <b>Woolfall &amp; Rimmer v Moyle</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1942%5d%201%20KB%2066" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1942] 1
KB 66.</a>    
<P>

18   	The starting point is a consideration of the terms of the
contract. If no reasonable interpretation of it gives rise to ambiguity
plainly
no question of a construction <i>contra proferentem </i>arises; <b>C.E Heath
Underwriting &amp; Insurance (Australia) Pty Ltd v Edwards Dunlop &amp; Co Ltd
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20176%20CLR%20535" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 176 CLR 535</a> at 548.  In this regard the Court must not set out to
look for ambiguity in order to work presumptions against the insurer; <b>Wilson
v Harvey Trinder (NSW) Pty Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1973%5d%202%20NSWLR%20870" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1973] 2 NSWLR 870</a> at 878. In <b>A.F. &amp;
G. Robinson v Evans Bros. Pty. Ltd. </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1969/110.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1969] VicRp 110</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%20VR%20885" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] VR 885</a> at 895 Starke J
observed:
<P>

"The maxim is to be applied and the words of the policy, being the words of the
insurers, are to be construed, in the sense in which
a prudent and reasonable
assured would understand them. The principle, however, ought to be applied only
for the purpose of removing
a doubt, not for creating a doubt or magnifying an
ambiguity where the circumstances of the case raise no difficulty". 
<P>

19   	The policy, in section A2, clearly provides that only one
of the three types of cover, (a) any driver, (b) drivers aged 25
and over and
(c) drivers aged 25 and over plus named drivers, may be selected by the
insured. The Schedule records the category of
drivers selected. In this case
the Schedule states that the drivers covered are drivers aged 25 and over. 
<P>

20   	The circumstance that in section E2 of the policy under
the heading "How Much is the Excess?" there appears the statement
"The
`additional excess' shown on your current Schedule applies only when your car
is driven by a person under 25 years of age, licensed
less than two years in
Australia or undergoing tuition" does not seem to me to introduce ambiguity
with respect to policies in which
the restricted `drivers 25 and over' option
is selected. 
<P>

21   	Paragraph (a) of section E2, after referring to the `basic
excess', which is described as applying to every claim, goes on
to state, "To
this amount is added the following if applicable".  Thereafter appears
reference to the excess which applies in respect
of convertible/open cars. The
policy contains `speak-easy panels' which are described as providing extra
information or short summaries
for the insured but which do not form part of
the policy (the `speak easy' panels are represented by the shaded portions of
section
E2 of the policy set out in paragraph 10 above). The `speak easy panel'
which provides additional information concerning the excess
payable in relation
to convertible/open cars states "the `<b>extra</b>' amount below recognises
higher risk for certain vehicle types, <b>without charging a higher
premium</b>".  Paragraph (b) which gives details of the additional excess is
also accompanied by a `speak easy panel'. That panel does not include
the words
<b>"without charging a higher premium".</b>  
<P>

22   	The policy booklet contains information with respect to
each of the three types of cover offered by the defendant. I do not
consider
that a reasonable reading of a contract comprising the policy and a Schedule
identifying the drivers covered as "category
B - drivers 25 and over" would
suggest, by reference to the terms of section E2, that on payment of the
additional excess the policy
would extend cover in respect of  drivers aged
under 25 years.
<P>

23   	The plaintiff relies on the inclusion of the details as to
the excess payable in respect of drivers aged under 25 on the Schedule.
This
document was prepared by the defendant in response to the plaintiff's proposal.
There is no issue but that the plaintiff's proposal
was for the restricted
"drivers 25 years and over" category. However, the plaintiff contends that the
inclusion of the details as
to additional excess in the personalised Schedule
must be taken to introduce ambiguity into the contract.
<P>

24   	Having regard to the terms of section A2 together with the
selection of `category B - drivers aged over 25' on the Schedule
I do not
consider that the inclusion of details of the additional excess gives rise to
uncertainty such that the Court should construe
the parties' contract as one
extending cover to any driver aged under 25 years (driving with the insured's
permission) on payment
of the additional excess. I do not consider when fairly
read the contract is susceptible of such an interpretation.  
<P>

    
<P>

25   	The defendant submits that the provision in the Schedule
as to the additional excess payable in relation to drivers aged under
25 years
applies in the event that the insured's vehicle was driven with his permission
by his spouse (she being aged under 25 years)
in connection with her
occupation.  This was the construction the Magistrate adopted. I do not
consider that he erred in so doing
or that his reasoning involved the exposure
of a further ambiguity in the contract.
<P>

26   	The Summons is dismissed.
