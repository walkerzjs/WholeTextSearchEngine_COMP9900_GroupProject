<P>

<b>Judgment</b> (Defendant's applications re Plaintiff's List of Documents)
<P>

1   	On 4 November 1999 I delivered a judgment on the
defendant's Notice of Motion for further discovery:  ([1999] NSWSC 1081: 
DLJT:
50).  On 17 November 1999 the plaintiff delivered a List of Document pursuant
to the orders I made.
<P>

2   	It is a long document which purports to categorise the
Discovery in accordance with the categories and classes of documents
to which I
referred in my orders.  At this point it can be mentioned that the plaintiff
has marked `*' in Part 1 of Schedule 1 documents
that he "<i>does not produce
for inspection". </i> In the same Part 1 of Schedule 1 are documents marked
`**' in respect of which a claim for client legal privilege is made, the
documents
relating to the files and ledger cards of former clients of the
plaintiff's firm.  
<P>

3   	Documents are enumerated in Part 2 of Schedule 1 in respect
of which litigation privilege and confidential communication privilege
is
asserted.  
<P>

4   	The defendant makes what in reality are several
applications.  The first is an application for inspection of those documents
marked `*'.  It makes a fresh application for particular discovery in relation
to documents identified in three categories:  documents
provided by the
plaintiff to Inspector Woodhouse in November 1998;  documents provided to
Inspector Woodhouse on 8 March and 22 March
1999;  documents that now are MFI
22 in the trial being documents in respect of which privilege was held to have
been waived during
the cross-examination of Dr Dent.  An application for
particular discovery is also made with respect to the plaintiff's diaries in
the light of the evidence contained in Exhibits D, E and F in the Discovery
Application, a memorandum of the plaintiff in relation
to Shane Olive.
<P>

5   	The circumstances of the argument relating to the
defendant's applications could at best be described as intolerable in that
counsel were obliged to conduct the matter over three separate days,
interrupted by other applications in relation to other aspects
of the
proceedings.  Submissions concluded on 15 December but the Court's attention to
them could not be paid however until after
the conclusion of further
interlocutory applications on Thursday 16 December.
<P>

6   	For the defendant it is submitted that given the purpose of
discovery being that all documentary material of the other party
is to be
discovered so that it can consider its effect on its own case and its opponents
case and decide how to carry on the proceedings,
and to put before the Court in
due course all relevant documentary evidence, documents in respect of which no
claim for privilege
is made, which came into existence prior to the litigation,
which are "<i>relevant" </i>by reason of their being discovered, cannot be
precluded from inspection on discretionary grounds unless not to do so would
permit
an abuse of process or where disclosure would involve "<i>trade secrets"
</i>or cognate matters:  <b><i>Church of Scientology of California v Department
of Health &amp; Social Security</i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%201%20WLR%20723" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 1 WLR 723</a>;  <b><i>Kimberley
Mineral Holdings Limited (In Liq.) &amp; Anor v McEwan</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%201%20NSWLR%20210" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 1 NSWLR
210.</a>  The situation is to be distinguished from that which founded the exercise
of my discretion in what is known as the <i>"Corrs Subpoena"</i> judgment
([1999] NSWSC 428:  DLJT: 39 - 7 May 1999) in relation to subpoenaed documents.
Those documents were precluded from inspection
on a discretionary basis by
reason of their purpose being to attack the credit of the defendant's witnesses
and to be deployed in
defence of the justification case.  The discretion
exercised pursuant to <b><i>Waind v Hill</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%201%20NSWLR%20372" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 1 NSWLR 372</a> is not
available in the circumstances I have outlined.  I agree with the submission
that nothing said by Clarke J in <b><i>Marcus v Provincial Insurance Co.
Limited</i></b> (unreported, 11 May 1983) in the circumstances with which his
Honour was there concerned, nor anything said by Santow J in <b><i>Broadwater
Taxation &amp; Investment Services Pty Limited v Hendriks</i></b> (unreported,
9 September 1993), derogates from the fundamental position advanced for the
defendant.  I have had regard to the submissions
of Mr Hall that there is no
limitation in respect of the time of the creation of the documents nor a
restriction to the "<i>abuse of process / trade secrets"</i> bases, however I
am not by them persuaded.
<P>

7   	Thus, to put it shortly, the <b><i>Waind v Hill</i></b>
discretion exercised in the <i>Corrs Subpoena </i>judgment is not available for
exercise here, and in any event, I do not accept the proposition that the
"<i>compilation</i>" of the group of documents including, pre-litigation
documents, said to be for the forensic purpose of attacking the defendant's
witness, merely by reason of that fact, that is, the compilation of such
documents, provides a basis for non-inspection.  For example,
in relation to
the photographs, the plaintiff in his list has "<i>selectively"</i> identified
documents within the various categories which he is prepared in fact to have
the defendant inspect. 
<P>

8   	Order 1 of the orders set out below reflects the
application of the view I have formed.  
<P>

9   	With respect to the documents `**', it is the plaintiff's
position that he will abide the order of the Court in relation to
the files in
respect of which it is merely asserted that they were former client files.  I
propose to order that those documents,
including the ledger cards be made
available for inspection.  As to the latter, there is authority in support of
the proposition
that privilege does not attach to such material;  <b><i>Re
Packer</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%2015%20ATR%20651" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 15 ATR 651</a>;  <b><i>Allen Allen &amp; Hemsley v Deputy
Commissioner of Taxation</i></b> (1989) 89 ATC 4294.
<P>

<b>Motor vehicles</b>
<P>

10   	A great deal of time was spent on the agitation of the
adequacy of the plaintiff's discovery under this heading .  In my judgment
of 4
November 1999 I dealt with the specific category (category 1) in paragraphs 15,
16, 17 and 18. The relevant order is in general
terms in paragraph 64.  The
plaintiff in the List of Documents, in Schedule 1 Part I refers to
"<i>documents produced by the Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales
under a subpoena for production in these proceedings</i>".  In Schedule 2 which
relates to documents the plaintiff has had but are not known in his possession,
custody or power, there is
enumerated "<i>3.  Registration documents for
vehicles owned by the plaintiff</i>".
<P>

11   	Exhibit C in the proceedings is an extract from a Record
of Interview of Mr Chown.  It really does no more than indicate that
Mr Chown
had knowledge of the plaintiff's ownership of some Mercedes Benz vehicles
(which does not, thus far, appear to be in issue).
 I do not need material such
as Exhibit C.  
<P>

12   	It may now be the situation, I do not know, that the
plaintiff without reference to the RTA documents is simply unable to
remember
one way or the other which cars he owned and when, which cars were provided to
him by his law firm or the Law Society (as
per my earlier judgment).  What is
clear is that the statement in Schedule 2 is in sufficient compliance with the
order I have made.
 The plaintiff will be directed, in Order 3, to comply with
the previous order and the Rules of Court.
<P>

<b>Home Building Plans</b>
<P>

13   	I do not propose to require anything further of the
plaintiff in relation to documents 6 and 7 in Schedule 1 Part 2 under
the
heading "<i>Category (2) - (The plaintiff's house)"</i>.  I accept that such
documents even though sourced from the Council may have undergone attention
that warrants the application of
the claim for privilege.
<P>

<b>The Plaintiff's Diaries</b>
<P>

14   	Exhibit F indicates that as at 9 July 1999 the plaintiff
was still in possession of relevant diaries.  This involves what
I have above
described as in effect a new application for particular discovery.  There are
good grounds for it.  It was indicated
for the plaintiff that instructions may
clarify the situation.  Exhibit F, as I have said, indicates the present
existence of diaries
from the past, and Exhibits D and E being examples of
diaries in fact produced point to the existence of the "<i>other diaries</i>".
The plaintiff will be directed to give proper discovery in the light of the
material in Exhibits D, E and F:  see Order 4.  Again,
as I stressed in my
earlier judgment, the plaintiff is required to give discovery of these
documents.  If he proposes to make any
claim for privilege he is free so to do.

<P>

<b>The "Robert Cussons" Document</b>
<P>

15   	This document is document (h) in paragraph 23 (statutory
declarations) of annexure 1 to my judgment of 4 November 1999, annexure
1 being
the Schedule appended to the Notice of Motion that led to that judgment.  There
is, to my mind, some uncertainty as to the
status of this document (whatever it
is).  On instructions, Mr Hall (T3372.20) indicated that the document has never
been given to
the Police and that privilege has not been waived.  The
impression I gain is that in some way it was listed in error somewhere else
giving rise to its inclusion in the subpoena schedule and thus my judgment.  It
is referred to as document 100 "<i>Statutory declaration of Robert Cussons
dated 11 February 1998"</i> in category 23 - statutory declarations, page 33 of
the plaintiff's List of Documents in respect of which a claim for privilege is
made, the document being in Part 2 of Schedule 1.  It is desirable that the
confusion in relation to this document (that is how I
see it) should be cleared
up.  In Order 5 the plaintiff will be directed to give discovery of this
document again or more than one,
if there be more than one, and to identify the
grounds of privilege claimed.  It is hoped thereby that any question of waiver,
at
least, will thereby be answered. 
<P>

<b>D16 (John Maynard) Documents - Woodhouse "<i>November 1998</i>" Documents,
MFI 22</b>
<P>

16   	Exhibit B in the proceedings on the Motion is an index of
the documents in MFI 22 being the documents in respect of which
privilege was
waived during the course of the cross-examination of Dr Dent.  This is the
first relevant set of documents.  
<P>

17   	Exhibit A on the Motion is another set of documents being
what I will call the "<i>Woodhouse November 1998</i>", the second set of
documents.
<P>

18   	The third set of documents are the documents protected by
my discretionary ruling in the Corrs Subpoena judgment relating
to what I will
describe as Woodhouse documents of February/March 1999.
<P>

19   	The fundamental position as I understand it is this:
whilst there is a list of documents available in relation to the first
and
second set of documents there is none available as to the third.  The
plaintiff, in my view, should not be required to list those
third set of
documents because by so doing the purposes of the exercise of my discretion
could well be defeated. 
<P>

20   	The difficulty is, and it is an understandable one,
whether there is included within the third set of documents protected
by the
exercise of my discretion, documents "<i>not protected</i>" by reason of the
waiver of privilege in MFI 22 documents or by reason of the Court of Appeal's
decision in relation to the second
set of documents.  The statement "<i>No
documents</i>" in relation to John Maynard (D16) on page 13 of the List of
Documents simply cannot be correct.
<P>

21   	It has been argued on this occasion as it was on the last
that it would at the very least be a matter of convenience if all
categories of
documents were listed in details.  I am not persuaded, in all the circumstances
of this case and certainly at this
point of a trial, that "<i>mere
convenience</i>" is a basis for ordering the plaintiff to list those documents.
Two of the three lists are known.
<P>

22   	I agree with the proposition which can be articulated to
the effect that the plaintiff should not be able to hide behind the
benefit of
the discretionary order in his favour to preclude the revelation of the
identity of documents which hitherto have not
been listed but which in fact
have been afforded no protection by reason of either their becoming part of MFI
22 or by the operation
of the judgment of the Court of Appeal.  In other words,
the plaintiff should be required to give discovery of any documents within
the
third category (the "<i>protected documents"</i>) which are the same as
documents in MFI 22 or the first category of documents.  The protection
afforded by my discretionary ruling
would not be compromised by taking that
step and I propose, in Order 6, to require it.
<P>

23   	The predominance of success on the Motion favours the
defendant and the plaintiff will be ordered to pay the defendant's costs.
<P>

24   	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	The plaintiff is to produce for inspection to the defendant by no later than
4pm on 7 January 2000 documents: 2, 4, 5, 10, 16,

137-146, 148, 150-153,
170 and 175.
<P>

2.	The plaintiff is to produce for inspection by the defendant within the time

Order 1, by reference to individually described documents,
of any document or
documents included within the documents the subject of my ruling (<i>Corrs
subpoena</i> 7 May  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/428.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">1999: NSWSC 428:</a>  DLJT: 39) and which is or are included in

documents comprising
Exhibit A on this Motion (copy indices herewith).
<P>

7.	The exhibits on the Motion are returned.
<P>
