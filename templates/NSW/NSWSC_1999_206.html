<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:   On 18th February this year, the Residential Tenancies Tribunal
made an order that the tenancy agreement between
the defendants as lessors and
the plaintiff as lessee was terminated, and that possession was to be given to
the lessor on 25th February
1999.  On 5th March 1999, the plaintiff applied for
a re-hearing under s.63 of the Residential Tribunal Act.  That application was
rejected for reasons set out in a document signed by the Chairperson of the
Tribunal.
<P>

2	The plaintiff lessee has appealed from both decisions, and I am dealing with
an application for a interlocutory injunction to
restrain the defendant lessors
from taking possession of the subject premises.  
<P>

3	Prior to the hearing on 18th February 1999, orders had been made by the
Residential Tenancies Tribunal on 25th January 1999. 
The orders recorded that
the Tribunal was satisfied that a breach of the agreement had occurred, namely
rent arrears; and by consent
of the parties, the following further orders were
made:
<P>

	<b><i>1.	The tenant, JOE ASSI, is to pay the landlord, TAE CHOY KEUNG &amp;
MES AU PO CHUN, C/- Ray White City South, 758 George Street,
SYDNEY NSW 2000,
the sum of $4780.00 for rent owed under the terms of the residential tenancy
agreement for the period from 01/12/98
to 31/01/98 (sic) by the following
payments:  $1000 on or before 25/01/99 and $3780.00 on or before
27/01/99.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	NOTE:	If the other party does not comply with the order to pay money, a
certified copy of the above money order may be obtained from
the Tribunal for
the purpose of enforcement action through the Local court.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	2.	Additionally, the tenant, JOE ASSI, is to pay rent, presently
$2390.00 per calendar month, on the first day of each month, next
payment due
01/02/99, and once the arrears are paid in full, to pay rent in accordance with
the residential tenancy agreement, being
one month in advance.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	3.	If these orders are not complied with then at any time before
25/04/99 the landlord may request the relisting of the application
to determine
whether the tenancy agreement should be terminated.</i></b>
<P>

4	There is evidence before me that on and between 1st February and 17th
February 1999, the plaintiff spoke with an employee of the
defendants' agent on
at least three occasions, and said to him that he had a cheque for the February
rent, to which he was told "We
only accept cash".  The plaintiff replied that
it was inconvenient for him to go to the office every time and pay cash.
<P>

5	Pursuant to Order 3 made on 25th January 1999, the matter was re-listed on
18th February 1999.  As I understand it, it is common
ground that the plaintiff
was given notice of that listing.  However, he has given evidence that on that
day, he received an urgent
telephone call from the director of a client company
who instructed him to appear for that company at the Supreme Court on that day.
It appears that some communication was made by the plaintiff to the Tribunal,
and a letter was sent to the Tribunal by the plaintiff
in the following
terms:
<P>

	<b><i>I refer to our discussion of today and confirm my request for an
adjournment until tomorrow or Monday as I am representing a client
in the
Supreme Court today and am unable to attend the hearing before the
Tribunal.</i></b>
<P>

6	Notwithstanding that request, the Tribunal proceeded to deal with the matter
and made the order for termination and possession
to which I have referred.
The plaintiff then put on the application for a re-hearing.  Such an
application is to be made in writing,
and is dealt with by the Chairperson of
the Tribunal without an appearance.  
<P>

7	Question 12 in the application form is as follows:  "Describe the substantial
injustice you have suffered and how a re-hearing
would ensure a different
outcome".  To that question, the plaintiff replied:  "I could not attend the
hearing because I had another
matter in the NSW Supreme Court on that day".
The application also contained a statutory declaration stating that the
plaintiff "had
to attend a hearing in the New South Wales Supreme Court on
behalf of a client".
<P>

8	The form goes on to state "You must also describe how your presence would
have changed the outcome of the hearing".  Under that
statement, the plaintiff
wrote "The evidence presented will show that I complied with all of the
previous orders excepts for one
due to the agent not permitting me to do so by
not accepting the payment by cheque".  The form went on to request that the
applicant
set out any other reasons why the decision was not fair or equitable;
and on that point, the plaintiff has written out "I have subsequently
on two
occasions tendered payment by cash and the agent has refused to accept it".
<P>

9	In the part of the form dealing with the question of what evidence would now
be available that was not reasonably available at
the time of the hearing, the
plaintiff has written:  "1.  Payment receipt.  2.  Letter to agent offering
payment to end of March
1999".  The form then requires an indication of why
these documents were not available at the time of the hearing, and there the
plaintiff has written "I could not attend".  
<P>

10	The application was rejected by the Chairperson, and the reasons given were
as follows:
<P>

	<b><i>Your Application for a rehearing under Section 63 of the Residential
Tribunal Act 1998 has been considered in terms of the legislation
and I have
made the following decision:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	The application for a rehearing of matter number 99/0931 is not granted
as I am not satisfied that the applicant may have suffered
a substantial
injustice.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Reasons for decision:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	In particular, I am not satisfied the decision of the Tribunal on the
18/2/99 was not fair and equitable, or against the weight of
evidence or that
evidence that is now available was not reasonably available at the time of the
hearing.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Under Section 63(2) on the face of the application, it does not appear
to me that the applicant may have suffered a substantial injustice.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	The applicant' request for an adjournment was received and considered by
the Tribunal, together with the submissions made on the
landlord's behalf at
the hearing.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Based on the applicant's rental history presented to the Tribunal at the
hearing, I do not consider evidence the landlord's agent
did not accept payment
by personal cheque would have changed the outcome of the hearing, as 3 cheques
for rent have been dishonoured
since October, 1998.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	There is no evidence the payment receipt referred to in 12(iii) is for a
payment in addition to those listed in the rent record of
the landlord's
agent.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	The submission of a letter to the 'agent offering payment to end of
March 1999' would also, in my opinion, not have altered the outcome,
as it is
entirely a matter for the landlord and the landlord's agent as to whether an
arrangement for payment outside the terms of
the earlier Tribunal order of 25
January, 1999 is accepted.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	Finally, there is no evidence that the subsequent attempts to pay the
landlord's agent by cash were made before the order of the
18 February,
1999.</i></b>
<P>

11	The application before me raises questions as to the effect of ss.60, 62 and
63 of the Residential Tribunal Act 1998, which are
in the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>60(1)	Except as provided by this section, a court of record has no
jurisdiction to grant relief or a remedy by way of:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(a)	a judgment or order in the nature of prohibition, mandamus,
certiorari or other relief, or</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(b)	a declaratory judgment or order, or</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(c)	an injunction,</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	in respect of a matter heard and determined or to be heard or determined
by the Tribunal in accordance with this Act or in respect
of any ruling, order
or other proceeding relating to such a matter.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(2)	A court is not precluded from granting relief or a remedy of a kind
referred to in subsection (1) in relation to a matter in
which the jurisdiction
of the Tribunal to determine the matter was disputed, where the ground on which
the relief is sought is that</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(a)	the Tribunal gave a ruling as to its jurisdiction that was
erroneous, or</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(b)	the Tribunal erred in refusing or failing to give a ruling as to its
jurisdiction when its jurisdiction was disputed.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(3)	A court is not precluded from granting relief or a remedy of a kind
referred to in subsection (1) in relation to a matter in
which the Tribunal has
made an order, where the ground on which the relief or remedy is sought is
that:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(a)	the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to make the order, or</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(b)	in relation to the hearing or determination of the matter, a party
to the claim had been denied natural justice.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	...</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	62(1)	An appeal under this section is to be made in accordance with
rules of the Supreme Court.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(2)	If, in proceedings before it, the Tribunal decides a question with
respect to a matter of law, a party to the proceedings who
is dissatisfied with
the decision may appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(3)	After deciding the question the subject of an appeal by a party
under this section, the Supreme Court may, unless it affirms
the decision of
the Tribunal on the question:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(a)	make such order in relation to the proceedings in which the question
arose as, in its opinion, should have been made by the Tribunal,
or</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(b)	remit its decision on the question to the Tribunal and order a
rehearing of the proceedings before the Tribunal.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(4)	If a rehearing is held, the Tribunal is not to proceed in a manner,
or make an order or a decision, that is inconsistent with
the decision of the
Supreme Court remitted to the Tribunal.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(5)	If a party to  proceedings before the Tribunal has appealed to the
Supreme Court against a decision of the Tribunal on a question
with respect to
a matter of law, either the Tribunal or the Supreme Court may suspend, until
the appeal is determined, the operation
of any order or decision made in the
proceedings.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(6)	If the Tribunal suspends the operation of an order or a decision,
the Tribunal or the Supreme Court may terminate the suspension
or, where the
Supreme Court has suspended the operation of an order or a decision, the
Supreme Court may terminate the suspension.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(7)	If a rehearing is held, fresh evidence, or evidence in addition to
or in substitution for the evidence on which the original
decision was made,
may be given on the rehearing.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(8)	A reference in this section to a matter of law includes a reference
to a matter relating to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	63(1)	In circumstances prescribed by the regulations, a party to
proceedings before the Tribunal may, in the manner and within a
time so
prescribed, apply to the Chairperson for an order directing that the matter be
reheard by the Tribunal, on the ground that
the applicant may have suffered a
substantial injustice because:</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(a)	the decision of the Tribunal was not fair and equitable,
or</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(b)	the decision of the Tribunal was against the weight of evidence,
or</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(c)	evidence that is now available was not reasonably available at the
time of the hearing.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(2)	The Chairperson is not to grant the application unless, on the face
of the application, it appears to the Chairperson that the
applicant may have
suffered a substantial injustice.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(3)	If the application is granted, the Chairperson is to determine the
constitution of the Tribunal in a manner appropriate for the
purposes of the
rehearing, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the requirements
of natural justice.</i></b>
<P>

<b><i>	(4)	The matter is to be dealt with as a hearing de novo by the Tribunal
as constituted under subsection (3).</i></b>
<P>

12	Mr. Assi, who is the plaintiff, has submitted that the reasons disclosed an
error of law in that the Chairperson should have
found that, in terms of s.63,
the applicant may have suffered a substantial injustice because evidence that
was now available was
not reasonably available at the time of the hearing.  The
evidence showed refusal by the landlords' agent to accept a cheque, in
circumstances where cheques had been accepted in the past.  It was not open to
refuse to accept the payment on that basis, and the
Chairperson erroneously
held that the evidence of the refusal of payment by cheque would have made no
difference to the result. 
He submitted that, although the tenancy agreement
itself provided that rent payment must be made by debt system payment card
No.000131483,
that had been waived, and the evidence indicated payments by
cheque had been accepted in the past.  Alternatively, it was submitted
that the
order of 25th January 1999 required payment in accordance with the agreement,
so that to require payment by cash was to
require something that the agreement,
and thus the order, did not require.  He submitted that the reasons disclosed
the error in
basing the decision on "the applicant's rental history".  He
submitted that the case of <u>Schierholter v. CIM Resources Ltd.</u>, Hampel,
J., Supreme Court of Victoria, 18/2/97, showed that payment by cheque was good
payment and proper tender where the agreement
between the parties provided for
it.
<P>

13	Mr. Ashhurst for the defendants submitted that the case of <u>Re Parker</u>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%2079%20FLR%20338" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 79 FLR 338</a>, especially at p.342, showed that the general law still was
that, while payment by cheque will be accepted unless the payee, at or
before
the time of receipt of the cheque, objects that the cheque does not constitute
legal tender, nevertheless in the absence of
agreement to the contrary, it is
still open to a payee to take objection that the cheque would not be legal
tender.  A requirement
of cash is, in substance, such an objection.  Mr.
Ashhurst also referred me <u>George v. Cluning</u> (1979) 28 ALR 57.
<P>

14	I have noted Mr. Assi's submissions concerning the matter of refusal of a
cheque.  At one stage, Mr. Assi also attacked the original
decision of the
Tribunal as having been made in denial of natural justice.  In my opinion, in
circumstances where Mr. Assi had notice
of the hearing and failed to attend, or
to send a representative, in the circumstances I have described, it was plainly
not a denial
of natural justice for the Tribunal to proceed with the case.
<P>

15	Turning to the attack on the later decision of the Chairperson, I will
proceed on the assumption that a decision of the Chairperson
under s.63 is a
decision of the Tribunal under s.62, which can be an attacked on appeal.  It
seems to me that that is the correct
view of the matter, and no submission to
the contrary was made by either party.  
<P>

16	The refusal of the application was based squarely on the view of the
Chairperson that the Chairperson did not consider that evidence
that the
landlords' agent did not accept payment by personal cheque would have changed
the outcome of the hearing.  There was no
discussion of the question of whether
that was evidence "not reasonably available at the time of the  hearing" within
s.63(1)(c).
 It may have been open to find, in the circumstances of Mr. Assi's
absence from the hearing, that the evidence was reasonably available,
because
the circumstances of his absence gave him no reasonable excuse for not
attending.  There is no evidence before me, and there
was no evidence before
the Tribunal, as to why the client's case in the Supreme Court had to be dealt
with in the way that it was,
in preference to Mr. Assi's attending at this
hearing.  However, as I have said, the decision was not based on that ground;
so it
is necessary to consider whether there was an error of law in the
decision that the evidence would not have changed the outcome.
<P>

17	In my opinion, it does seem clear that the requirement for payment specified
in the lease itself had been waived.  The question
is whether the lessor in
those circumstances could refuse to accept a cheque.  Had there been material
before the Chairperson that
cheques had been tendered and accepted over a
period of time without dishonour, and that no proper notice had been given
altering
that situation, then I think the evidence of refusal to accept the
personal cheque could certainly have changed the outcome.  However,
all that
was before the Chairperson was material indicating that, in the past, cheques
had been tendered, and three of them had been
dishonoured.  The additional
material put before the Chairperson by the applicant went no further than
asserting that payment by
cheque had been refused.  There is nothing in the
application to suggest that there was any practice or agreement or other basis
on which the landlords were bound to accept a cheque.  
<P>

18	Mr. Assi submits that, if the appeal were to fail on that basis, that would
be taking an overstrict and technical view of the
matter.  However, the problem
has arisen because of what appears to have been a rather cavalier attitude
towards the procedures of
the Tribunal, and the legislation makes it plain that
appeals from the decision of the Tribunal are strictly limited.  In order for
an appeal to succeed, an error of law has to be shown.  In my opinion, for the
reasons I have given, an error of law has not been
shown.  
<P>

19	This is an application for an interlocutory injunction, so strictly the
question is whether there is a serious question to be
tried.  I have reached a
fairly firm view on whether an error of law is shown; and perhaps it could be
said that I should not come
to such a firm view, but merely accept that the
degree of argument in this case suggests a serious question.  However, if I
took
that view, I would come to the balance of convenience; and when one has
regard to the history of this matter, I do not see that the
balance of
convenience favours the plaintiff.  His lease has only about six months to run
in any event.
<P>

20	For those reasons, I do not extend the interlocutory injunction, except
perhaps for a short period to ensure that there can be
an orderly transfer of
possession.
<P>

21	Although it would be theoretically possible for the plaintiff to continue
with these proceedings, because I have been dealing
with the case essentially
on an interlocutory basis, the plaintiff accepts that there would be little
point in doing so, and does
not seek to do so; so the appropriate order will be
that the proceedings should be dismissed.
<P>

22	Upon the plaintiff continuing the existing undertaking as to damages, and
undertaking to vacate the premises with his property
within seven days, I
extend the existing injunction until and including 19th March 1999.
<P>

23	Otherwise I dismiss the proceedings.
<P>

24	I order the plaintiff to pay the defendants' costs of the proceedings.
