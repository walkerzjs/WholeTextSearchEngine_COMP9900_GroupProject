ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (ex tempore;  revised 17 December 1999)</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The proceedings of which the present application
forms part are proceedings brought by the Law Society of New South
Wales
against a solicitor, Nicholaos Milios, and a company of which he was a
shareholder called Vacentia Pty Limited.  Pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p8" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 8</a> of the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal
Profession Act 1987</a> (NSW) the Court has appointed David Patrick Watson to be
receiver of the property of Mr Milios.  Mr Watson, by notice of motion filed
on
8 December 1999, seeks directions as to whether in his capacity as receiver he
is justified in entering into and completing the
settlement of a claim which he
has made against Vacentia for recovery of money which he alleges to be trust
money belonging to Mr
Milios' clients. 
<P>

2  	The Court's authority to give a direction of the kind which Mr
Watson seeks is conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s113.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 113</a> of the Act, which relevantly says that the
Supreme Court may give directions to a receiver for the exercise of an
authority conferred
on him by the Court when he was appointed.  When Mr Watson
was appointed he obtained by virtue of that appointment the authority
to take
proceedings of the kind which I have described for the recovery of property, by
virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s98.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 98</a> of the Act.
<P>

3  	The function of the Court, when an application for directions is
made, was described by Young J in<b> </b><i>Sanderson v Classic Car Insurances
Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%2010%20ACLR%20115" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 10 ACLR 115</a>, 117 in the analogous circumstances, of
directions to a provisional liquidator.  As his Honour there said, it is
appropriate for
the Court to give directions in order to provide guidance to
the applicant on matters of law.  As I shall describe, the application
in the
present case raises primarily a question of law as to the proper construction
of the Corporations Law.
<P>

4  	Vacentia appeared as respondent to Mr Watson's application in
order to support submissions made on Mr Watson's behalf that he
is justified in
entering into and completing the settlement.  The Court also received written
submissions from the solicitor for
a company called Speedy Gantry Hire Pty
Limited, which, as will appear, is a subsidiary of Vacentia. Speedy Gantry did
not, however,
make any application to appear at today's hearing.
<P>

5  	The issue which the Court has been asked to consider today was
raised in correspondence on behalf of Mr Hassall, who together
with his company
is a minority shareholder in Speedy Gantry, of which he is also a director.
Pursuant to directions which I gave
on 8 December 1999 Mr Hassall was served
with the application and given the opportunity to appear, but has indicated
through his
solicitors his election not to be represented at today's
hearing.
<P>

6  	I need recount the underlying facts of this case only briefly.
In 1987 Mr Milios acted in connection with the acquisition by
Vacentia of a 51
per cent shareholding in Speedy Gantry Hire.  Negotiations for the acquisition
of the shares, which were eventually
purchased by Vacentia from a Mr Nielsen,
by an agreement dated 8 December 1997, completed on 5 January 1998 were
initially conducted
by Michael Foy on his own behalf and on behalf of Bradley
Montgomery.  The negotiated purchase price was $1,500,000.  While Mr Milios
became involved in the transaction as the lawyer for Messrs Foy and Montgomery,
he evidently developed an interest in it as a co-purchaser.
 He agreed with Mr
Foy and Mr Montgomery that Vacentia would be formed with the three of them as
shareholders and directors, and
that it would acquire the 51 per cent interest
in Speedy Gantry through loans provided by all three shareholders.
<P>

7  	The evidence indicates that the sum of $958,233.69 was paid out
of the trust account of Mr Milios' firm to another firm of solicitors
called
Chris Wlodarczyk &amp; Co and that most of that amount was used as settlement
money for completion of the acquisition of the
shares in Speedy Gantry on 5
January 1998.  After Mr Watson was appointed as receiver on 20 November 1998 he
conducted investigations
which led to his filing a notice of motion in the
Common Law Division of this Court seeking orders for recovery of the moneys
paid
out of Mr Milios' trust account in a total amount of $963,245.39.
<P>

8  	The notice of motion seeks to recover that sum from Vacentia and
in the alternative to obtain a declaration that the shares
in Speedy Gantry
held in the name of Vacentia are charged with the payment of that amount in
favour of the receiver.
<P>

9  	Since the time of filing the application on 8 March 1999 the
receiver has had negotiations with Mr Foy and Mr Montgomery which
have led to a
proposal, contained in a draft deed of settlement, for settlement of the
receiver's claim.  The proposal initially
put forward in the draft was that the
claim would be settled and appropriate releases given in consideration of the
payment by Vacentia
to the receiver of $435,000.  Messrs Foy and Montgomery and
Vacentia would provide warranties including a warranty and that the settlement
sum paid by Vacentia would be obtained by way of additional shareholders' loans
from Messrs Foy and Montgomery.
<P>

10  	It appears that after the initial draft was prepared Messrs Foy
and Montgomery did not succeed in obtaining the funding which
they had intended
to obtain in order to perform their obligation under the settlement proposal
and, therefore, the proposal was altered.
 In its altered form the proposal
involves Speedy Gantry lending the $435,000 to Vacentia to enable the latter to
pay that money
over in terms of the deed of settlement.  The receiver has
required that the warranty by Messrs Foy and Montgomery be varied to become
a
covenant to effect that if the receiver is obliged to disgorge the settlement
sum, then they will reimburse the receiver.  Two
alternative texts of that
provision are in evidence and evidently the final version has not been settled,
though it appears that
all relevant parties agree that such a provision will be
included in the deed of settlement.
<P>

11  	The shareholders of Speedy Gantry are a company called
Gainguard, which I understand to be associated with Mr Hassall, Mr and
Mrs
Hassall, and Vacentia.  Vacentia holds 73,001 A Class shares and 1,460 B Class
shares.  Gainguard holds 29,201 A Class shares
and Mr and Mrs Hassell hold
42,340 B Class shares.  Mr Hassell, Mr Foy and Mr Montgomery are the directors.
The constitution of Speedy
Gantry is not in evidence before me, but the case
has proceeded on the basis that the shareholding of the Hassell interest is a
minority
shareholding as regards voting.  Obviously however, it would be a
controlling shareholding in a meeting at which Vacentia was precluded
from
voting.
<P>

12  	Through his solicitors Mr Hassall has objected to the proposed
settlement on the ground that it is improper.  When asked to
particularise the
objection, Mr Hassall's solicitor identified s 260A and s 260B of the
Corporations Law, and also alleged that the
loan from Speedy Gantry to Vacentia
was not authorised by any resolution of the former's board of directors.  The
latter point appears
to have evaporated.  The solicitor for Speedy Gantry, Mr
Conomos, wrote to Mr Hassall's solicitors on 2 December 1999 particularising
the relevant resolution of the board of directors of Speedy Gantry and
enclosing a draft set of minutes.  Mr Hassall has been subsequently
invited by
the receiver's solicitors to indicate whether there remains any basis of
objection as far as the authorisation point is
concerned and he has not
replied.  
<P>

13  	The question with respect to ss 260A and 260B of the
Corporations Law remains, however, as the only objection of a substantial
kind
for consideration by the Court today.
<P>

14  	Section 260A is relevantly in the following terms:
<P>

`A company may financially assist a person to acquire shares in a company ...
only if:
<P>

(a)	giving the assistance does not materially prejudice:
<P>

(i) 	the interests of the company or its shareholders; or
<P>

(ii)	the company's ability to pay its creditors; or
<P>

(b)	the assistance is approved by shareholders under section 260B (that section
also requires advance notice to ASIC); or
<P>

(c)	the assistance is exempted under section  260C.'
<P>

15  	Section 260B sets out a procedure for shareholder approval which
has not been embarked upon in the present case.  For present
purposes it is
sufficient to note that if a special resolution of the shareholders of Speedy
Gantry were to be sought, no votes could
be cast in favour of the resolution by
Vacentia because it is the person who acquired the 51 per cent shareholding in
Speedy Gantry.
<P>

16  	The section is the successor to provisions which may be traced
back to recommendations in the United Kingdom by the Greene
Committee (Cmd
267).  The Greene Committee was concerned with a practice whereby a syndicate
would acquire a controlling shareholding
of a target company by the use of a
temporary loan, and upon obtaining control replace the directors with its
nominees and cause
the new board to lend the target's liquid funds to the
syndicate in order to repay the temporary loan.  In effect, the company's
own
funds were being used to finance the acquisition of a controlling interest in
its shares.  For present purposes it is significant
that the acquisition of
shares necessarily preceded the provision of  financial assistance in the
Greene Committee's example.  
<P>

17  	The statutory prohibition on financial assistance became s 67 of
the<b> </b>Uniform <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ca1961107/" class="autolink_findacts">Companies Act 1961</a> which prohibited a company `whether
directly or indirectly' from giving financial assistance `for the purpose of or
in connection
with' an acquisition `made or to be made' of its shares.  That
section was considered in a line of cases which included<b> </b><i>Juniper Pty
Limited v Grausom</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%201%20ACLC%201342" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 1 ACLC 1342</a>, which made it clear that the section
was capable of applying where the financial assistance took place after the
acquisition provided
that the two were sufficiently linked.
<P>

18  	The statutory provision was reformed in the 1980s and became s
205 of the Corporations Law, prior to the amendments to the
Corporations Law by
the<b> </b>Company Law Review Act 1988. The 1980s amendments expanded the
wording of the section, no doubt with the intention of clarifying the
section's
scope and meaning.  However, it is far from clear that this intention was
achieved.  Importantly, however, s 205 retained
the linking words `for the
purpose of or in connection with' and it expanded on the meaning of the links
in two separate subsections
(ss 205(3) and (4)).   Even having regard to their
expanded meaning, it is hard to see how the words `for the purpose of' can be
satisfied in a case where the acquisition occurs before the financial
assistance is provided.  That at any rate was the conclusion
reached by Young J
in<b> </b><i>Tallglen Pty Limited v Optus Communications Pty Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2016%20ACLC%201526" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998)
16 ACLC 1526</a>, 1532.  However, his Honour pointed out that the words `in
connection with' in their expanded definition were capable of applying
to a
case where the acquisition precedes the financial assistance.
<P>

19  	That was the state of the law when s 205 was repealed and
replaced by provisions which include s 260A.  The reforms achieved
by the<b>
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/clra1998210/" class="autolink_findacts">Company Law Review Act 1998</a> were part of a project of simplification of the
Corporations Law.  It is essential that this overall object be borne in mind
when
the new section is interpreted.  The simplification to the financial
assistance prohibition was dramatic and severe.  The words `for
the purpose of
or in connection with' and their expansion in separate subsections all
disappeared, being replaced by the single word
`to'.  But s 260A(2) made it
clear, nonetheless, that the financial assistance could occur after the
acquisition of shares had taken
place.  The explanatory memorandum for the
Company Law Review Bill contains the following provision:
<P>

`Paragraph 12.76.  The Bill therefore prevents a company giving financial
assistance to a person to acquire shares, or units of
shares, in the company or
a holding company if the transaction would materially prejudice the interests
of the company or its shareholders,
or materially prejudice the company's
ability to pay its creditors (Bill s 260A(1)(a)).  This is subject to the
exception that a
company will be able to give financial assistance if the
transaction has been approved by the company's shareholders in the manner
set
out in section 260B (Bill s 260A(1)(b)).  This approach is intended to minimise
the difficulties the rule currently causes for
ordinary commercial
transactions.  In particular, for transactions which do not involve material
prejudice, the new rules will make
it unnecessary to decide whether the
transaction involves the giving of financial assistance.  The new rules will
bring the requirements
for financial assistance more closely into line with
those proposed for capital reductions.'   
<P>

20  	While this paragraph does not bear directly on the issue for
determination today, it is, nevertheless, illuminating in a more
general sense.
It indicates that part of the intention of the legislative drafter was that
those considering the application of the
prohibition (including those planning
transactions as well as judges) should focus their attention on whether the
transaction would
materially prejudice the interests of the company or its
shareholders or the company's ability to pay creditors.  If material prejudice
is thought to be involved, then the transaction should be put to the
shareholders for advance approval.  If not, then the section
does not stand in
the way of implementing the transaction.  Specifically, by focusing on material
prejudice the drafter intended
to minimise the scope for debate about the
inclusive language of the section.  The implication is that courts should be
careful not
to set in train a new jurisprudence of the technical and limiting
construction.
<P>

21  	In the present case it is striking that the proposed settlement
has arisen some years after the acquisition, and has arisen
out of the
happening of events which could not have been in the contemplation of any party
to the acquisition at the time when it
occurred.  I should note in passing that
the acquisition occurred, in my view, no later than 5 January 1998 when
completion of the
share transaction took place, notwithstanding that the share
transaction was funded by loans to Vacentia from its shareholders. 
As Mason
and Brennan JJ said, in circumstances only approximately analogous, in<b>
</b><i>Calverley v Green</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/81.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 81</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20155%20CLR%20242" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 155 CLR 242</a>, 257, the acquisition of
property takes place when title is transferred in exchange for payment of the
balance of the purchase money
notwithstanding that part of the purchase money
is provided out of secured loans which are subsequently repaid.
<P>

22  	Given that striking separation in time between the events of
acquisition and the current financial proposal, it would be surprising
if what
is now proposed fell within any mischief which s 260A is intended to address.
Certainly the difference between the present
facts and the transaction which
concerned the Greene Committee is obvious, for in the Greene Committee's
transaction the syndicate
always contemplated using the company's liquid funds
to provide finance, at least in the intermediate term, for the acquisition of
its shares.
<P>

23  	The argument for the view of Mr Hassall that s 260A has an
application to these facts was not placed before the Court today.
 However, it
seems to be that the genesis of the proposed payment of $435,000 by way of
settlement of the receiver's claim was the
wrongdoing by Mr Milios, when he
used trust funds to provide his loan as shareholder to Vacentia in order that
Vacentia could acquire
its 51 per cent shareholding in Speedy Gantry.  The
argument appears to be that Mr Milios' wrongdoing sowed the seeds for the
receiver's
appointment and claim, and ultimately the loan by Speedy Gantry
which is now proposed.  Therefore, it may be contended, there is
a factual
connection between the acquisition of the shares and the subsequent loan, even
though the loan is not made for the purpose
of the acquisition.  That
contention raises for consideration the degree of connection which the new law
requires between the acquisition
and the financial assistance.  
<P>

24  	Counsel for the receiver contended that the new law has
substantially narrowed the scope of the statutory prohibition, by confining
the
degree of connection between the acquisition and the assistance which is
necessary before the section applies.  In his submission
the relevant link is
that for the section to apply there must, at the time of the acquisition of the
shares, be a contract or arrangement
in existence which would deliver the
financial assistance, even if the assistance is delivered after the acquisition
has occurred.
<P>

25  	The alternative view is to say that because the new provisions
were part of a project for simplification of the law and were
not intended to
create new limitations  which would detract from the fundamental question of
material prejudice, the new section
should be interpreted in light of its
predecessor.  On this view the words `assist a person to acquire shares'
contain within them
much of the old case law with respect to the requisite
linking between acquisition and assistance.  Without seeking to articulate
the
requisite link conclusively, this view would imply that the section may be
attracted in broader circumstances than the receiver's
submission would contend
- that financial assistance may be held to have been made `to acquire shares'
even if the assistance comes
after the completion of the acquisition, possibly
some time after its completion, provided there is a link between the two which
draws the transaction within the policy concerns which the section
addresses.
<P>

26  	In my view the broader approach is preferable, having regard to
the legislative history of the section, the explanatory memorandum
to which I
have referred, and most importantly the public policy which the section seeks
to implement, as articulated by the Greene
Committee.  The literal wording of
the section is not particularly helpful, though the broader view sits more
easily with s 260A(2)
than the narrower view, the latter effectively requiring
the Court to insert some qualifying words into that subsection.
<P>

27  	Fortunately, it is unnecessary for me finally to decide between
these alternative approaches.  As counsel for the receiver
submitted, whether
one takes the broader or the narrower approach it is clear that the section
does not apply to the present transaction.
 This is because of the complete
severance between the circumstances which obtained when the acquisition
occurred and the circumstances
which now exist when the loan is in
contemplation.  
<P>

28  	It is true that the acquisition was funded at the time by
improper use of trust funds, but nothing currently proposed arises
out of that
fact.  In the meantime, events have occurred which include the appointment of
the receiver, the commencement of the receiver's
proceedings against Vacentia
for recovery, and negotiation for the settlement of those proceedings, in which
at first it was contemplated
that the settlement sum would be funded by Messrs
Foy and Montgomery rather than Speedy Gantry.  Each of those contingent events
has taken the present circumstances further away from what was in contemplation
when the acquisition occurred.  Whatever the precise
meaning of the statutory
words, my view is that the loan by Speedy Gantry to Vacentia of the settlement
sum which the latter will
pay to the receiver cannot be said to constitute
financial assistance to Vacentia `to acquire' the 51 per cent interest which it
completely acquired as long ago as 5 January 1998.  Therefore, on the  facts
the section does not apply.
<P>

29  	Since the application of s 260A is the only issue before the
Court and I have resolved that issue in favour of the receiver
entering into
and completing the deed of settlement, it seems to me appropriate that I should
grant the relief which the motion seeks.
