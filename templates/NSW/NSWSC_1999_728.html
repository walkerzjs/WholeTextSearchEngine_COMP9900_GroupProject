<P>

<b><u>L00001/99 - REGINA v Francesco SERGI</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>DETERMINATION</u></b>
<P>

1   	HER HONOUR:  Francesco Sergi makes application pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13A</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></b> 1989 for a determination of both a
minimum term and an additional term in relation to a sentence of penal
servitude for life imposed
on him by Moffatt J on Wednesday 25 October 1967
following his conviction after trial of two counts of murder.
<P>

2   	The history of the matter is as follows.  On 26 January
1967 the applicant, who was then aged twenty-one years, surrendered
himself at
the Fairfield Police Station.  He notified a police officer that he had shot
his brother and sister-in-law.  He handed
over the pistol which he had used to
commit the offences.
<P>

3   	He was interviewed by detectives and charged with the
murder of his brother, Domenico, and his sister-in-law, Katrina.  They
were
aged twenty-four and twenty respectively at the time of their death.  They were
the parents of an infant daughter.
<P>

4   	The applicant was born and raised in Calabria.  He came to
Australia to live as a young man with his family.
<P>

5   	The background to the shooting of his brother and
sister-in-law brought it within what might be described as a crime of passion.
He had come to learn that his younger sister, who had recently married, had
been accused by his sister-in-law of having lax morals.
 In particular it was
suggested that she had been involved in a sexual relationship with a young man
called Carmine prior to her
marriage.  
<P>

6   	These rumours relating to the applicant's sister led her
young husband, Vincent, to leave her and return to Italy in circumstances
which
brought disgrace on the Sergi family.  
<P>

7   	The sister returned home. The applicant appears to have
been distressed and to have felt, as the oldest male member of the
family
living at home, that he bore responsibility for remedying the damage that had
been done to the family's honour.  It was in
that context that the two murders
occurred.
<P>

8   	The jury before whom the trial proceeded made a strong
recommendation for mercy.  Of more significance, having regard to my
task
today, I note that his Honour, the very experienced trial judge, referred to
the strong recommendation for clemency and expressed
his agreement with it.
<P>

9   	Prior to the commission of these offences, the applicant
was a young man of good character.  A report has been prepared by
the Serious
Offenders' Review Council that sets out in summary fashion references to the
applicant's progress during the course of
his period in custody following his
conviction and sentence.
<P>

10   	Such material as is there disclosed suggests that the
applicant made a good adjustment to prison life and was viewed as industrious
and co-operative.  Indeed, I note the contents of a Parole Board report of 18
October 1974 which states that the applicant had earned
excellent reports while
in custody.
<P>

11   	That report also sets out some details concerning the
applicant's domestic arrangements.  It appears that prior to his conviction
he
had become associated with a young woman who had some health difficulties and
who bore his son about two months after his arrest.
 She had maintained contact
with the applicant throughout the period of his custody.
<P>

12   	Turning again to the report of the Parole Board of 18
October 1974, it was noted that the Board had interviewed the applicant
and
found him to be an alert, intelligent and articulate young man.  The members of
the Board were of the view that it was unlikely
that he would again resort to
violence.
<P>

13   	The Board noted the strong recommendation for clemency and
concluded at that time that a term of about ten years' penal servitude
would be
an appropriate period for the applicant to serve as the custodial portion of
the life sentence.
<P>

14   	On 27 January 1978, a licence was issued pursuant to
section 463 of the <b>Crimes Act</b> as it then stood.
<P>

15   	On 1 February 1978 the applicant was released pursuant to
the terms of that licence.  That licence was in what might be described
as
conventional terms.  It was expressed as being for the period commencing on the
date of the applicant's release and terminating
on 31 January 1983.  The
applicant was required to report to the Probation and Parole Service during the
currency of that licence.
<P>

16   	The applicant has given evidence before me today and he
states that he reported in conformity with the requirements of the
licence and
enjoyed a good relationship with his Parole Officers.  He was still able to
recall the names of these Parole Officers.
 He said that the reporting
requirements had been reduced to nil prior to the expiration of the licence.
<P>

17   	There is no suggestion that the applicant breached any of
the terms of the licence prior to 31 January 1983.
<P>

18   	Tendered on the applicant's behalf is a report of Dr
Jonathan Carne dated 2 June 1999.  That helpful report includes material
relating to the applicant's progress following his release on licence.
<P>

19   	The applicant married in 1979.  I understand this was to
the young woman with whom he had formed the relationship and who
had borne him
the child immediately prior to his conviction.
<P>

20   	He started working in a concreting business and apparently
that business went well until the recession of the late 1980's.
 At that time
the applicant experienced financial difficulties.  By that stage he was the
father of three children.
<P>

21   	In the latter part of 1993 the applicant was charged with
an offence of unlawfully producing a large quantity of a dangerous
drug, namely
cannabis sativa.  That offence occurred in Queensland.  He was admitted to bail
and remained at liberty until his conviction
before the Supreme Court of
Queensland.
<P>

22   	On 29 January 1996 he was sentenced by Ambrose J to a term
of six years' imprisonment.  In accordance with the Queensland
statutory scheme
he became eligible for parole after serving three years of that sentence.
<P>

23   	The applicant states, and I accept, that he was not aware
that he was still the subject of the licence after 31 January 1983.
<P>

24   	Whilst he was in custody in Queensland, at his own
initiative, he contacted the authorities in New South Wales with a view
to
determining his status.  This was brought about by the circumstance that the
Queensland Correctional Authorities had no notification
of his discharge from
licence in New South Wales.  He was thus deemed to be a life sentence prisoner
and was treated differently
to other prisoners.
<P>

25   	In response to his inquiry on 10 October 1997 Mr Neil Guy
of the Department of Corrective Services informed the applicant
that the
licence remained on foot.  Mr Guy drew the applicant's attention to the effect
of the decision of the New South Wales Court
of Criminal Appeal in the case of
<b>Boylan</b>, unreported, 21 December 1995.  Thereafter, it appears that the
applicant sought, pursuant to the provisions of the Interstate Transfer
Scheme,
to be returned to New South Wales at the earliest opportunity with a view to
making an application pursuant to section 13A
of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></b>.
<P>

26   	As it turns out, those arrangements were not put in place
prior to his release on parole and extradition to New South Wales.
 In that
regard, I should note that, on 24 July 1997, the Parole Board of New South
Wales revoked the applicant's licence for breach
of the condition that he be of
good behaviour.
<P>

27   	On 2 February 1999 the applicant was received in custody
at the Grafton Correctional Centre, having been extradited from Queensland
following the granting of his parole at the expiration of the minimum period of
three years.
<P>

28   	The report of the Serious Offenders Review Council
attaches a number of documents which chart the progress of the applicant
while
in custody in Queensland.  They were uniformly good reports, some of them
compellingly so.  They speak of a mature prisoner
who took such opportunities
as were available to him to do courses, who was viewed as compliant with prison
discipline, friendly
and possessed of insight into his situation.
<P>

29   	By way of example, I note the contents of a report
prepared by R. Dempsey dated 24 October 1996 relating to the applicant's
participation in a course described as "Personal Awareness, Confidence and
Growth".
<P>

30   	It is noted that the applicant attended all sessions and
was fully committed.  As to his motivation, the author of the report
observes,
"Frank wanted to do this course. He came with open-mindedness and maturity to
gain new perspectives and to integrate things
better".  As to his participation
it is observed, "Frank was a joy to have in class, seriously minded but good
humoured and adaptable".
 As to co-operation it is said, "Frank brought a
mature awareness to all he did.  He is a gentleman".
<P>

31   	Returning to the contents of Dr Carne's report, he deals
at some length with the applicant's account of the circumstances
leading to the
double murder and with the applicant's subsequent remorse and understanding of
the appalling wrong which he had committed.
 He notes that the applicant was
extremely depressed for a considerable period after the shooting and that he
gave an account of
feeling "absolutely awful" for years.
<P>

32   	The applicant expressed, in the course of his discussions
with Dr Carne, profound regret at the killing of his brother and
sister-in-law.
He described the process of gradual reconciliation with his family following
these tragic events.  This extended to
his orphaned niece, the daughter of his
victims, making contact with him. The family now accept him at family
functions.  The applicant
had, throughout the period of his custody, maintained
contact with his mother and the report of Dr Carne is supportive of the view
that he had developed insight into the terrible impact of his crime on her as
well.
<P>

33   	Most importantly, Dr Carne notes that the applicant has no
history of drug or alcohol abuse and no history of psychiatric
illness.  In Dr
Carne's opinion there is no evidence that the applicant has an anti-social
personality disorder.  That is to say,
there is no evidence that he manipulates
or takes advantage of others for his own gain.
<P>

34   	It is Dr Carne's opinion that there is little chance of a
recurrence of a similar crime in the future.  Indeed, he expressed
the view
that, "There is every expectation that the applicant will now lead a
law-abiding life".  He considers that the applicant
presents no threat to the
community or to his family and that there is no indication for psychiatric
treatment.
<P>

35   	The expression of those opinions, in my view, receives
strong support, having regard to the custodial history of the eleven
years
served following the murder and, more recently, the very positive picture
painted in relation to the applicant's period of
imprisonment in Queensland.
<P>

36   	I am required, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13A</a> sub-section 9, to
have regard to the matters that are set out in sub-paragraphs A to D, together
with any other relevant matter.
 In that regard, I am required to give
consideration to the report of the Serious Offenders Review Council, and I do
so.
<P>

37   	I note that the report of 11 May 1999 of the Council
observes:
<P>

"Since his return to full-time custody he has behaved himself and observed
prison routine.  The intervening periods spent on licence
in the community
presents as offence free until the charge pressed in 1993 and his conviction
and sentence in 1996".
<P>

38   	The report goes on to observe that, in the event that the
life sentence is re-determined by this Court, a plan would be prepared
for the
applicant's future management.  It is noted that the plan would include
provision for progressive reductions in classification,
leading ultimately to
the inclusion of daily and other temporary leave programs as a means for
preparing the applicant for release
back into the community.
<P>

39   	The applicant is the subject of a parole order arising out
of the Queensland conviction.  I am informed that, in the ordinary
course, that
order will be registered and the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service
will supervise the applicant under a reciprocal
arrangement.
<P>

40   	It is not necessary for me to detail the applicant's
family support.  It is attested to in the material before me on this
application.  It is made clear by the presence today of members of the family.
It does not seem to me that this is a case, having
regard to the applicant's
background and his strong family ties, in which real concerns arise as to his
ability to return to the
community.  I make that observation because I am
mindful of the portion of the Serious Offenders Review Council report that
speaks
of a plan for the provision of the progressive reductions in
classification, with a view to assisting the applicant to return to
the
community.
<P>

41   	The Crown has invited me to impose a re-determined
sentence such as would see the applicant released shortly, but subject
to
supervision by the New South Wales authorities for an additional term of at
least the length of the outstanding parole period.
 I have some difficulty
seeing the utility of that.  I note that the applicant is subject to the
Queensland parole prder.
<P>

42   	Another matter that I am required to have regard to is the
need to preserve the safety of the community.  Having regard to
the contents of
the Serious Offenders Review Council reports and the annexures thereto and to
the report of Dr Carne, I do not consider
that that matter raises any lively
concern in this case.
<P>

43   	I am also required to have regard to and to give
substantial weight to any relevant recommendations, observations and comments
made by the original sentencing Court when imposing the sentence concerned.
That presents some practical difficulties in a case such
as this, where the
relevant remarks were made over thirty years ago.
<P>

44   	I have in mind to give substantial weight to the
sentencing Judge's endorsement of the jury's strong recommendation for clemency
in the minimum term which I propose imposing. 
<P>

45   	As I have already indicated, the Crown submits that it is
appropriate that the effect of any sentence that I impose be such
as to see
this applicant released in the near future.
<P>

46   	The only matter, as it were, in contest between the Crown
and Mr Nicholson SC, who appears for the applicant, is the question
of whether
the sentence ought to, in total, expire as at today's date or, as the Crown
invites me to do, at a date some three years
hence, in order to provide for the
applicant's supervision on his return to the community.
<P>

47   	Essentially, my task is to reflect those matters that a
sentencing Judge would, in the ordinary course, give weight to together
with
the other matters, to which I have already referred, as set out in the
section.
<P>

48   	The Crown has impressed on me that this was a crime of
considerable gravity, it being a double murder.  Whilst there is obvious
force
to that submission, equally I must have regard to the jury's recommendation and
the Judge's endorsement of it.
<P>

49   	In all the circumstances, I propose to grant the
prisoner's application.
<P>

50   	Pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13A(4)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></b>, I
impose a minimum term of eleven years' penal servitude to date from 26 January
1967 and to expire on 25 January 1978.  I impose
an additional term to expire
on this day, 19 July 1999.
