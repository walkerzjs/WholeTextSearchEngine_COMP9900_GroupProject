<b>13185/98   -   NEW SOUTH WALES INSURANCE MINISTERIAL</b>
<P>

<b>			CORPORATION  v  LISA ANN GINMAN</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Appeal against decision of costs assessor)</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  The appellant by summons filed 31 December 1998 appeals
against the decision of costs assessor Mr P Johnstone made on 10 December
1998
and seeks an order that decision be set aside.  The appellant relies on s 208L
of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b> 1987.  The applicant relied on the affidavit
of Joseph Michael Crestani sworn 16 February 1999.  
<P>

2	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 208L</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b> provides:
<P>

	<b>"Appeal against decision of costs assessor as to matter of law </b>
<P>

<b>(1)	A party to an application who is dissatisfied with a decision of a costs
assessor as to a matter of law arising in the proceedings
to determine the
application may, in accordance with the rules of the Supreme Court, appeal to
the Court against the decision. </b>
<P>

<b>(2)	After deciding the question the subject of the appeal, the Supreme Court
may, unless it affirms the costs assessor's decision:
</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	make such determination in relation to the application as, in its
opinion, should have been made by the costs assessor, or </b>
<P>

<b>(b)	remit its decision on the question to the costs assessor and order the
costs assessor to re-determine the application.</b>
<P>

<b>(3)	On a re-determination of an application, fresh evidence, or evidence in
addition to or in substitution for the evidence received
at the original
proceedings, may be given."</b>
<P>

3	The facts are not in dispute.  They are as follows.
<P>

(1)	On 15 February 1996 Abadee J gave judgment in relation to an action for
damages brought by Lisa Ginman (the respondent in these
proceedings) who
suffered injuries in a motor vehicle accident.  His Honour awarded the
plaintiff the sum of $38,037.40 and entered
judgment accordingly.  His Honour
ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs to be determined by the
amount recovered.
<P>

(2)	On 20 September the appellant filed an application for assessment of
party/party costs in the proceedings.
<P>

(3)	On 26 October 1998 the respondent served a statement of objection to the
appellant's bill of costs.
<P>

(4)	On 17 November 1998 the appellant served a reply to the notice of
objection.
<P>

(5)	On 10 December 1998 the costs assessor issued a certificate of
determination assessing costs and disbursements in the sum of
$17,195.
<P>

(6)	On 17 December 1998 the costs assessor provided his reasons.  He stated:
<P>

<b>"1.	I applied <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> Rule 33(4)(d) of the Supreme Court Rules to the
solicitor's costs to 1 July 1994.</b>
<P>

<b>	In my discretion I did not apply the Rule to:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	disbursements;</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	solicitor's costs after 1 July 1994.</b>
<P>

<b>  2.	My reasons are:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	More probably than not the applicant had reasonable grounds at the time
of commencement of proceedings for considering that the
Supreme Court was an
appropriate jurisdiction.</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	The Respondent suffered no prejudice by reason of commencement in the
Supreme Court in terms of quantum of costs recoverable for
disbursements, or
for deregulated professional fees post 1 July 1994.  These costs would have
been of substantially the same order
even if the Applicant had commenced
proceedings in the District Court."</b>
<P>

4	The issue to be determined is whether the costs assessor had a discretion in
relation to the application of Part 52A r 33(4)(d)
of the <b>Supreme Court
Rules</b>.  The appellant submitted that the costs assessor failed to apply the
50% deduction to disbursements as well as to the professional
costs, whereas
both the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b> and the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b> make
the deduction applicable to both costs and disbursements.  The respondent
submitted that it is entirely unnecessary for the
court on this application to
consider the issue of whether the costs assessor was entitled to exercise a
discretion pursuant to Part
52A r 33(5) or the issue of whether the discretion
found in r 33(5) is conferred on the court alone because the costs assessor had
a discretion to apply r 33(4).  According to the respondent this discretion
originates from s 208F(1A) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b>.
<P>

5	From the judgment of Abadee J, the personal injury action to which the costs
assessment relates was commenced in 1987.  The plaintiff
recovered $38,037.40.
Hence, the relevant portions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> r 33(4) and (5) of the <b>Supreme
Court Rules</b> provide:
<P>

<b>"(4)	Subject to subrule (5) where, by or under the rules or any order of the
Court, the plaintiff is entitled to his or her costs
of any proceedings to
which this rule applies, the amount of costs payable to him or her shall
-</b>
<P>

<b>	...</b>
<P>

<b>(d)	in respect of proceedings commenced after 31 March 1983, but on or
before 30 June 1993, where he or she recovers a sum more than
$10,000 but not
more than $50,000, be only a half of the whole amount;</b>
<P>

<b>	...</b>
<P>

<b>(5)	In a case to which subrule (4) applies, if it appears to the court that
the plaintiff has sufficient reason for commencing or
continuing proceedings in
the court, the court may order that the amount of costs payable to the
plaintiff be some greater part or
the whole of the amount which would be
payable to him or her apart from the subrule."</b>
<P>

6	Sections 208F(1) and (1A) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b> say:
<P>

<b>"Assessment of costs - costs ordered by court or tribunal</b>
<P>

<b>(1)	When dealing with an application relating to costs payable as a result
of an order made by a court or tribunal, the costs assessor
must
consider:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	whether or not it was reasonable to carry out the work to which the
costs relate, and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	what is a fair and reasonable amount of costs for the work
concerned.</b>
<P>

<b>(1A)	An assessment must be made in accordance with the operation of the
rules of the relevant court or tribunal that made the order
for costs.</b>
<P>

<b>	..."</b>
<P>

7	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208f.html" class="autolink_findacts">Subsection 208F(1A)</a> was introduced by the schedule 2[8] of the <b>Legal
Profession Amendment Act 1996</b> (No 95).  The second reading speech does not
assist in determining to what Parliament intended to achieve by adding the
subsection.
 But the "Explanatory Notes" referred to in the second reading
speech of 24 October 1996 and which accompanied the bill refer to
s 208F.  The
Explanatory Note says:
<P>

	
<P>

<b>"Procedure for assessments</b>
<P>

<b>	Section 208F, which deals with the assessment of costs ordered by a court
or tribunal, is amended so as to require a costs assessor,
when considering an
application relating to a bill of costs, to have regard to the operation of the
rules of the court or tribunal
making the order for costs.  (See Schedule
2[8])"</b>
<P>

8	In interpreting s208F(1A) I do not think that it is necessary to have regard
to the explanatory note to interpret s 208F(1A).
 The subsection is expressed
in clear terms.  Section 208F requires the costs assessor to firstly determine
whether it was reasonable
to carry out the work and what is a fair and
reasonable amount of the costs.  The costs assessor must make an assessment in
accordance
with the rules of the relevant court that made the order for costs.
Section 208F(1A) is mandatory as it says that the assessor "must"
make his or
her assessment in accordance with the relevant rules of the court.  Section
208F (1A) does not give the  costs assessor
a discretion.
<P>

9	The rule of court that the costs assessor was obliged to apply was Part 52 r
33(4).  The costs assessor applied this rule in relation
to solicitor's costs
prior to 1 July 1994 but stated that in the exercise of his discretion he did
not apply the rule to disbursements
and solicitor's costs after 1 July 1994.
<P>

10	In s 19 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></b> costs are defined.  Costs include
fees, charges, disbursements, expenses and remuneration.  Section 52A r 33(4)
is to be applied
unless a court orders that the amount of costs payable to the
plaintiff be some greater part or the whole of the amount which would
be
payable to him or her apart from the subrule.  In other words <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52A</a> r33(4)
applies unless the court otherwise orders in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/index.html#p52" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52</a> r 33(5).
A costs assessor cannot make an order in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/index.html#p52" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52</a> r 33(5) as
according to s 208S(4) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</a></b> he or she is not an
officer of the court when acting as a costs assessor.  In any event, Abadee J
did not make an order pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p52" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52</a> r 33(5) but rather ordered that the
plaintiff's costs be determined by the amount recovered.  His Honour stipulated
that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p52" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52</a> r 33(4) should be applied.
<P>

11	The costs assessor was obliged to apply <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p52" class="autolink_findacts">Part 52</a> r 33(4) and did not have a
discretion to act other than in accordance with the rule.  He should have
allowed only half of the whole
amount that he assessed as a fair and reasonable
amount of costs  The plaintiff has discharged its onus.  I am satisfied that
the
costs assessor has erred in law.  I uphold the appeal and set aside the
determination made by the costs assessor on 10 December 1998.
<P>

12	If the parties can agree on the amount that should have been allowed I can
make a determination in accordance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 208L(2)(2)</a> and this would save the
time and expense of referring the matter back to the costs assessor for
re-determination.  However, while
the parties agree on the arithmetic, the
respondent wishes to be heard in relation to the assumption upon which the
arithmetic is
based.  The matter ifs stood over to a date to fixed to allow
this to be done.  Costs should follow the event.  The respondent is
to pay the
appellant's costs.
<P>

13	The court orders:
<P>

(1)	The appeal is upheld.
<P>

(2)	The determination made by Mr P Johnstone, the costs assessor on 10 December
1998 is set aside.
<P>

(3)	The respondent is to pay the appellant's costs.
<P>

(4)	The matter is to be stood over to a date to be fixed to ascertain whether I
should make a determination as to costs or remit
the matter to the costs
assessor to re-determine the application.
