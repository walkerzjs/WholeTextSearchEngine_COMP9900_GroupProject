NEWCASTLE:  TUESDAY 24 AUGUST 1999
<P>

<center><b>REGINA v. BRADLEY JOHN MORAN</b>
<P>

<b>SENTENCE</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  The prisoner Bradley John Moran was indicted on 23
August 1999, for that he, between 12 and 15 November 1998 at
Beechwood in the
State of New South Wales, knowing Troy Clayton Davis and Dean Richard Lulham to
have committed the serious offence
of murder, failed without reasonable excuse
to bring information which might be of material assistance in the prosecution
of those
persons to the attention of a member of the Police Service.  To that
indictment he pleaded guilty.  That plea was entered to that
charge after he
received the advice of counsel, and at the first opportunity.  He had been
previously charged with murder and conspiracy
to murder.  The plea was accepted
in full discharge.
<P>

2  	He had remained in custody a period of some 14 days until he was
granted bail by the Supreme Court in November 1998.  At committal
in June 1999
he was discharged on the original charges, committed for trial on a charge of
accessory after the fact to murder, but
upon consideration, indicted eventually
on the charge to which he has pleaded.
<P>

3  	It would be an error for me to have regard to any of the other
charges in the sense of finding any facts adverse to him which
might amount in
law to a more serious charge -  <b>De Simoni v. The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/31.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 31</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20147%20CLR%20383" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 147 CLR
383.</a>  I do not do so, of course, but I do remark that on the evidence as it has
come forward before me, and on the statement of facts,
it would seem unlikely
that a charge of even accessory after the fact would have been successful.
<P>

4  	To the charge of conceal serious offence to which he has pleaded,
he responds that he did come to possess the necessary information,
but it came
into his possession at a time at which he was very drunk indeed, and that
whilst he was in possession of that information
for a period which might have
been as long as about 20 hours, he was drunk and most of the time he was
asleep.  There can be no doubt,
however, that during that period he came to
appreciate the seriousness of the information.  That is confirmed by the detail
of the
facts which are set out in the statement of facts provided on the plea
and marked Exhibit E.
<P>

5  	I summarise:  At approximately 11.30 pm on Thursday 12 November,
Troy Clayton Davis shot and killed Robert Christopher Spradbrow
in
circumstances I find, in this prisoner's case, amounting to murder.  He used a
gun which had been provided to him by his half-brother
Dean Richard Lulham, who
had driven him to Kooree Island where the killing occurred.  Lulham provided
lighting to assist the shooting,
incited, counselled and procured Davis to the
shooting.  The two brothers acted out of a belief in various grievances they
had arising,
so they asserted, because of the conduct of the deceased.
<P>

6  	Initially the death was not viewed as suspicious, but by about
2.00 pm on 13 November the authorities came to the realisation
that the death
may have been criminally caused.
<P>

7  	The prisoner was a friend of the two brothers.  He had been
consuming alcohol on the evening of 12 November 1998 from some time
early in
the evening.  Both in the statement of facts and in evidence before me he
confirmed that whilst he was in the presence of
the two brothers he heard Dean
Lulham "egging on" Troy Davis to shoot the deceased.  At one stage during the
evening he was at the
hotel with Ernice Davis, the mother of the two brothers,
the prisoner who I have sentenced earlier today.  Later at the hotel, at
a time
at which the prisoner's inebriation had grown greater, he was put into the back
of a  Range Rover motor vehicle owned by Lulham's
employer, a farmer.  He
expected to be driven home, but was driven instead to Kooree Island.  At this
time he appears to have been
dozing intermittently, no doubt because of the
effects of the alcohol.
<P>

8  	He became aware of a conversation between Lulham and Troy Davis.
He saw Davis leave the car with a gun.  He heard a shot.  Davis
returned to the
car and it drove off, stopping near the Beechwood cemetery where he saw Troy
Davis throw an item out the window.
 The car then went to Lulham's home and the
prisoner and Davis apparently continued drinking.
<P>

9  	At about 4.00 am the suggestion was made by Davis that he wanted
to get his mother's car for the purpose of shifting the gun.
 The prisoner went
with Davis for this purpose.  They were interrupted by the mother as efforts
were being made to move the car down
the driveway.  Mrs. Davis refused to allow
them to take the car and agreed to drive them herself because they were too
intoxicated.
<P>

10  	They went to the area of the cemetery.  There the prisoner and
Troy Davis searched for the gun, which the prisoner located,
and handed it to
Troy  Davis, and the gun was taken to another spot where it was secreted by
Davis. 
<P>

11  	They returned to Mrs Davis' house where some time during the
morning or towards lunch time the prisoner heard a conversation
between Lulham
and Troy Davis in which Troy admitted killing the deceased, and at that point
the prisoner thought about going to
the police but did not because he was
afraid something would happen to him.  Neither in his electronically recorded
interview with
suspected person nor his evidence did he articulate precisely
what it was that scared him.  This is not surprising, given the state
of his
inebriation and confusion on the night in question, and that the events
themselves must have carried with them a degree of
severe effect upon him.
Whether it be that he was scared of any one individual, or simply scared
because of the situation, is not
at all clear. 
<P>

12  	He continued to drink and sleep as I have said through the
balance of the day, until about 2.00 am on Saturday 14 November,
the police
arrived at the house with a search warrant.  He, Troy Davis and Ernice Davis
were arrested and taken to Port Macquarie
Police Station.
<P>

13  	At 5.35 am on Saturday 14 November he entered into the
electronically recorded interview to which I have referred, during which
he
gave a version of the events which, bearing in mind his condition at that time
as can be gauged from the amount of alcohol he
had had to drink over the
preceding 48 hours and the time of day at which that record of interview was
taken, was somewhat confused.
<P>

14  	He told the police that when he got in the car he did not know
what was going to happen.  He also said it was too dark at Kooree
Island to see
much of what occurred.  He did, however, provide information concerning the
conversations he had heard between Dean
Lulham and Troy Davis;  the presence at
Kooree Island of the brothers, and Troy Davis with the gun;  the hearing of the
shot;  the
attempted shifting of the murder weapon;  and the involvement of
Mrs. Davis.  
<P>

15  	The offence is committed in those circumstances, he having
failed to bring to the attention of police the information he had
received,
which was received at least by lunch time on 13 November, and his arrest at
2.00 am on Saturday the 14 November.  It would
seem therefore that that period
of twenty hours to which I have referred represents the relevant period taken
at its widest.
<P>

16  	The value of his evidence and his admissions is, of course,
affected severely by the degree of intoxication under which he
was labouring
that evening.  Nonetheless he has provided an undertaking to give evidence in
respect of any proceedings against Dean
Richard Lulham.  The reason for the
undertaking being in that form was that prior to his undertaking being
provided, Troy Davis had
already, on arraignment, pleaded guilty to the murder.
That undertaking is in the usual form, undertaking active cooperation, and
is
Exhibit A in the proceedings.  Subsequently Mr. Lulham has pleaded guilty.
<P>

17  	When one looks at the criteria under s.439 this is a matter in
which he has not only pleaded guilty, but pleaded guilty at
the earliest
possible occasion when this charge was preferred by the Crown.  His admissions
are such that one can only say he has
at all times admitted the role to which
he has now pleaded guilty.  His sentence will be reduced accordingly.
<P>

18  	When one has regard to s.442B of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> it can be seen
that his sentence should be reduced not only because of s.439 but also s.442B,
notwithstanding that the nature and
extent of his assistance or promised
assistance is somewhat restricted by reasons of the effects of alcohol and by
reason of his
limited perception of what was occurring that evening.
<P>

19  	The offence with which he stands charged is punishable by a
maximum penalty of two years imprisonment.  He has already, as
a consequence of
the refusal of bail, spent some 14 days in Cessnock Gaol.  He gave evidence it
frightened him.   There was evidence
from Mr. Francis Moran, and I accept his
evidence as well as the prisoner's evidence on this aspect, that the effect of
the imprisonment
upon him was to "frighten him a terrible lot".
<P>

20  	He is presently aged 20.  He was 19 at the time.  When he gave
evidence before me, he has confirmed by way of sworn testimony
his account of
the events, thus providing an account which is of utility to the Crown, and on
which he might if necessary be cross-examined.
<P>

21  	He has a limited prior record, which he admits, involving two
Children's Court matters, one involving malicious damage requiring
the payment
of compensation of $133.80 and in respect of which he was placed upon a two
year recognisance, the other stealing from
a motor vehicle.  I am told that he
was not a principal, but was one of a number of young boys, one of whom stole
from a motor vehicle.
 He was placed on a recognisance until 18 years of age
and was directed to pay compensation of $67.00.
<P>

22  	He works at the Bindi Aboriginal Cultural Centre as a labourer,
horticulturalist and artist.  He has done a TAFE course in
horticulture.
<P>

23  	He is supported by his family.  His sister supervises twenty
employees at that cultural centre.  He has resided with her from
time to time
during the bail period, and she has given evidence on his behalf and favourable
to him.
<P>

24  	He is involved in sport, and in that regard I have been provided
with written references confirming his involvement with the
Wauchope Bindi team
and his willingness.  There have been further written references provided by
John O'Raw as to his politeness,
punctuality and general good character;  by
Mr. Geoff Carson concerning his horticultural training;  by Deanna Wilmot as to
his conduct,
particularly in the context of his Aboriginal cultural environment
at the educational centre and at Bindi.
<P>

25  	The Probation and Parole Service refers to him as suitable for
those non-custodial options which might be available in the
area in which he
lives.  Ms. Yvonne Rennard of that service has given evidence before me
concerning the appropriateness in his case
of supervision by the service,
particularly in relation to programmes to address his substance abuse, that
relating to both the effects
of marijuana, which he had ingested that night -
though what role it may have played I know not - and the period of heavy
drinking
about which he gave evidence and about which his father Mr. Francis
Moran and his sister also gave evidence.  I have no doubt from
their evidence
and from his own that he is contrite, shocked and frightened because of what
went on that night and its consequences
for him.
<P>

26  	I have no doubt that he was thoroughly drunk and thoroughly
confused, but that by the time of entering into the ERISP he was
starting to
realise the awfulness of what he had involved himself in by his drinking and
his association with Troy Davis.  
<P>

27  	I am told by both Mr. Moran and Mr. William Smith, a Kamilaroi
man and law man for the Aboriginal community, a chairperson
of the local land
council, that he is a person who respects his elders and will abide by tribal
law as well as the law of the land.

<P>

28  	His father described him as a quiet, easy going boy, good with
his nephews and nieces, who is obedient and respectful.  I am
told by him, his
father, Mr. Smith and his sister that as a consequence of these events he now
does not drink, nor take marijuana,
that he is conscientious at work, and that
he loves his art.
<P>

29  	His father and Mr. Smith have made it clear that they are
prepared to afford him support to ensure that the supervision of
the Probation
and Parole Service is complemented by the activities of the Aboriginal
community in this regard and by his family environment.
 I have been told that
indeed so far is their confidence in his rehabilitation that elders of that
community would be prepared to
go surety for him on a recognisance. 
<P>

30  	The work that he does at Bindi is work involving both training
and also the production of Aboriginal artefacts for sale.
<P>

31  	Bearing in mind the difficulties inherent in the local area and
in transport, the appropriate course in my view is to defer
passing sentence
and to impose a recognisance.  Because the Aboriginal elders have evinced their
preparedness to go surety for him
and because, as Mr. Smith put it, his
community and elders will watch him, and a man who has been through the law
will fulfil that
watching role within his community, as well as Mr. Smith, his
uncle, looking after him, I would not require that there be formal
sureties,
since, as I expressed prior to the luncheon adjournment, I am fully persuaded
that the role of the formal sureties will
in fact be carried out by the
Aboriginal elders in any event.
<P>

32  	In all the circumstances, this is a matter in which, however, it
is appropriate the prisoner be convicted, and I do so, but
otherwise I defer
passing sentence upon the prisoner entering into a recognisance himself in the
sum of $1,000 for a period of three
years to be of good behaviour and to come
up for sentence if called upon.
<P>

33  	That recognisance is to be conditioned upon the prisoner
submitting himself for the supervision and guidance of the Probation
and Parole
Service for such duration of the term of the recognisance up to the whole term
of the recognisance as that service deems
appropriate, and to obey all
reasonable directions of that service as to participating in such programmes as
are designed to avoid
the abuse of alcohol and other substances as the service
might consider necessary.
<P>

34  	HIS HONOUR:  Is there anything further, gentlemen?
<P>

35  	THOMAS:  No your Honour.
<P>

36  	BARNETT:  There is one matter I wish to raise, your Honour.
Could I take your Honour to s.353A of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>, in particular to
subsection (4).  I draw your Honour's attention to the notation on the record,
which was Exhibit A, I believe.
 I am just asking for an order that he submit
himself to the officer-in-charge of Police at Newcastle for the purpose of
being fingerprinted.
<P>

37  	HIS HONOUR:  Mr. Crown, why?
<P>

38  	BARNETT:  If your Honour recalls, that document indicates he was
not fingerprinted in relation to this matter.
<P>

39  	HIS HONOUR:  Mr. Thomas, would you have a look please at the
stamp on Exhibit B?
<P>

40  	THOMAS:  I find that difficult to believe, your Honour, if he
was arrested and then taken into custody.
<P>

41  	HIS HONOUR:  Mr. Thomas, whether you find it difficult to
believe or not, it is not designed to be punitive.
<P>

42  	THOMAS:  No, I know, your Honour.  I have no objection to his
being fingerprinted.
<P>

43  	HIS HONOUR:  Do you want to explain it to him?
<P>

44  	THOMAS:  I will explain it to him, yes.
<P>

45  	HIS HONOUR:  Would you hand back the exhibit, and I will give
this explanation.  The order sought by the Crown is, because
very simply, that
it appears that a procedural step usual in such matters has never been carried
out, and that is that the present
prisoner has never been fingerprinted.  Such
a course can often be appropriate, not only for the purpose of identifying the
prisoner
with any particular criminal offence, but in order to prevent other
people's offences being attributed to him, which has occurred
on a number of
occasions when, unfortunately, you get a record and a prisoner with a
reasonably common name.
<P>

46  	I am prepared to make that order, and I do.
<P>

47  	BARNETT:  If your Honour reads the very last sentence --
<P>

48  	HIS HONOUR:  I warn the prisoner, Mr. Thomas, that a failure to
comply with the order may result in the prisoner having to
be apprehended in
accordance with subsection (6).
<P>

49  	THOMAS:  Yes your Honour.  He will go directly now.  As soon as
the recognisance has been entered he will go to the police
station, and I
presume there will be an officer here connected with the case who can take him
there.
<P>

50  	HIS HONOUR:  The recognisance may be taken before a
magistrate.
