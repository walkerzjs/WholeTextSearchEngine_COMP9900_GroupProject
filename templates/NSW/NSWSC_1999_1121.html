EQUITY DIVISION
<P>

AUSTIN J
<P>

THURSDAY 11 NOVEMBER 1999
<P>

<b>3627/99 - POONON PTY LTD  V  DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  On 30 September 1999 Deputy Registrar Howe made
orders that the defendant be wound up under the Corporations Law
and that
Stephen Allan Jay be appointed as liquidator.
<P>

2  	On 5 October 1999 the defendant's solicitors made an ex parte
application to me as duty judge for abridgment of time for service
of an
application by notice of motion for orders setting aside or staying the Deputy
Registrar's orders.  The application was far
short of what was needed for that
relief, disclosing no substantial grounds.  I declined to order abridgment of
time for service.
<P>

3  	A further ex parte application was made to Hodgson CJ in Eq on 30
October 1999 for abridgment of time for service of a similar
notice of motion,
on the ground that an appeal had been lodged.  His Honour held that the
application to set aside the orders was
misconceived in light of the appeal,
and while an application for a stay may be appropriate, it would need to be
supported by material
showing that there might be substance to the appeal.
Clearly his Honour had in mind that an application for a stay would be related
to the hearing and determination of the appeal.  He refused leave.
<P>

4  	The defendant subsequently filed and served a notice of motion
seeking to set aside or stay the Deputy Registrar's orders, returnable
on 26
October 1999.  Bergin J heard the application on that day.  The plaintiff
appeared and opposed it.  Her Honour held that the
evidence before her was
insufficient to justify a stay of the orders, noting that Hodgson J CJ in Eq
had rejected a similar application
to set the orders aside as misconceived.
She denied the application.
<P>

5  	The case came back to me on 1 and 2 November 1999 when the
defendant moved on a notice of motion filed on 8 October 1999.  This
curious
document purported to be both a further application for a stay of the Deputy
Registrar's orders and an appeal.  Although
cast as a notice of motion rather
than a notice of appeal, I take it that, to the extent that the documents gave
notice of an appeal,
the appeal was intended to be brought under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/taa1953269/index.html#p80a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 80A</a> r 21,
which causes <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/taa1953269/index.html#p60" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 60</a> r 11 - 15A to apply to an appeal from the Registrar's
decision to make a winding up order as if the Registrar were a Master.  On
that
basis such an appeal is heard by a single judge of this Division.
<P>

6  	On 12 October 1999 the defendant filed a `Notice of a
Constitutional Matter' which purported to be a notice to Attorneys-General
for
the purposes of s 78B of the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act 1903</a> (Cth) and also a notice
of intention to apply to the High Court of Australia for removal of the part of
the present  proceedings
into that Court under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s40.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 40</a> of that Act.
<P>

7  	By virtue of an affidavit filed and read in Court this morning,
which provides evidence to support what was submitted to me
from the Bar table
at the hearing, I am satisfied for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s78b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 78B</a> that notice of the
constitutional matter, which is said by the defendant to arise in these
proceedings, has been given to the Attorneys-General
of the Commonwealth and
the States and a reasonable time has subsequently elapsed.  The
Attorneys-General for the Commonwealth and
each State and Territory have
responded signifying they do not intend to intervene at this stage.  I do not
know whether the application
to the High Court under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s40.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 40</a> has proceeded.
<P>

8  	In my opinion, the defendant's appeal from Deputy Registrar
Howe's orders must fail for two reasons which I shall explain. 
I do not base
my decision on the procedural irregularities of the appeal, but rather on
matters of a more substantial kind.  The
further application for a stay must
fail because there are no new grounds not before Bergin J on 26 October 1999
and no arguable
basis for a stay once the appeal has failed.
<P>

9  	The first substantive reason arises out the s 471A of the
Corporations Law.  That section states that while a company is being
wound up
in insolvency or by the Court, a person cannot perform or exercise, and must
not perform or exercise, a function or power
as an officer of the company
except (relevantly) as liquidator, or with the liquidator's written approval,
or with the approval of
the Court.  The making and prosecution of an appeal
against the orders of the Court for the winding up of a company involves a
function
or power exercisable on the company's behalf.  But for the liquidation
that function or power would be exercised by the directors
of the company, who
are its officers.  But in view of the liquidation s 471A is a barrier to their
taking that step.  
<P>

10  	I was informed from the bar table that Mr Geale is the sole
director of the defendant and is providing instructions to the
defendant's
solicitor.  I was also told, though there is no evidence of this, that the
liquidator has been informed of the proceedings
and does not wish to intervene.
Of course, that falls well short of the written approval of which s 471A
speaks.  I see no ground
for the Court to grant its approval to allow the
director to bring and prosecute an appeal in the present circumstances.  It
follows
that this appeal has not been competently brought.  This conclusion
assumes, of course, that the Corporations Law is valid; that
is a subject to
which I shall return.
<P>

11  	The second reason relates to the defendant's substantive case on
the appeal.  The application to wind up the defendant was
brought under s
459P(1)) as an application for the company to be wound up in insolvency.  The
Court's power to make an order under
that section is found in s 459A. Section
459Q sets out an additional requirement which had to be satisfied in cases
where an application
for a company to be wound up in insolvency relies on the
company's failure to meet a statutory demand.  It has not been contended
that
the requirements of s 459Q were not complied with in the present case.  
<P>

12  	The significance of complying with s 459Q is that the Deputy
Registrar had before him on 30 September 1999 evidence of service
of a
statutory demand and failure by the defendant to comply with it, as well as
evidence verifying the debt.  Under s 459C(2) the
Court is required to presume
that a company is insolvent if, during or after the three months ending on the
day when the application
was made, the company failed to comply with a
statutory demand.  By s 459C(3) the presumption of insolvency operates except
so far
as the contrary is proved.
<P>

13  	Before me in the appeal is an affidavit by Mr Levick of 13
October 1999 which gives an account of his submissions to Deputy
Registrar Howe
on 30 September 1999.  Mr Levick says:
<P>

`On that occasion I made submissions to Deputy Registrar Howe that:
<P>

a.	No Statement of Claim had ever been issued against or served upon Poonon Pty
Ltd by either the Australian Taxation Office or
	any Commissioner or Deputy
Commissioner of Taxation.
<P>

b.	No lawful judgement had been obtained against Poonon Pty Ltd by either the
Australian Taxation Office or any Commissioner or
Deputy Commissioner of
Taxation.
<P>

c.	That the Plaintiff in this matter, being a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation,
was only a contingent or prospective creditor as
no judgement had been
entered.
<P>

d.	That there were Appellent judgements [sic] of the Court of Appeal in New
South Wales and from other jurisdictions where it was
declared that it is an
abuse of process to use a Statutory Demand procedure as a debt collection
device.'
<P>

14  	There was nothing in these submissions to challenge in any
factual way the presumption which arose out of the plaintiff's evidence
under s
459C(2).  On the available factual evidence the Deputy Registrar had no option
but to make the winding up order, unless the
material upon which the defendant
relied could properly be taken into account at that stage.  
<P>

15  	Section 459S is an obstacle to taking such material into
account.  That section states that insofar as an application for winding
up in
insolvency relies on failure by the company to comply with a statutory demand
(as in this case) the company may not, without
the leave of the Court, oppose
the application on any ground that company could have relied on in an
application by it for the demand
to be set aside, if the company did not rely
on the ground at that stage.  In the present case there is no evidence to
indicate that
any application was made to set aside the statutory demand.  If
the grounds which Mr Levick advanced before Deputy Registrar Howe
on 30
September 1999 were grounds upon which his client  could have relied in an
application to set aside the statutory demand, then
s 459S prevented those
grounds from being raised at the hearing before Deputy Registrar Howe in the
absence of the leave of the Court.
 No such leave was granted.  Sub-section
459S(2) adds to the defendant's hurdle by stating that the Court is not to
grant leave unless
it is satisfied that the ground is material to proving that
the company is solvent.
<P>

16  	In my opinion each of the matters referred to in paragraph 3 of
Mr Levick's affidavit is a matter which could have been raised
in an
application by his client to set aside the statutory demand.  It follows that
in the absence of the leave of the Court, the
defendant was not able to rely on
those matters at the hearing of the application for winding up.  This
conclusion is supported by
powerful considerations of public policy to which I
referred recently in my judgment in <i>Chief Commissioner of Stamp Duties v
Paliflex</i><b> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2017%20ACLC%20467" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 17 ACLC 467</a>, paragraphs 35-48.  I need not repeat
what I said there.  In my opinion this is a case where there is no proper basis
for departing
from the prima facie rule which s 459S sets up.
<P>

17  	It is not necessary for me to comment substantially on most of
the grounds which the defendant raises in the appeal, since
in my view the
appeal is answered against the defendant by provisions of the Corporations Law
to which I have referred.  However,
it is appropriate to comment briefly on
those grounds and one ground, which alleges that the Corporations Law is
invalid, must be
dealt with.
<P>

18  	The grounds of appeal are to be found in the notice of motion
filed on 8 October 1999, in the `Notice of a Constitutional Matter'
to which I
have referred, and in the defendant's oral and written submissions.  It emerges
there are six grounds in all, though in
the various ways in which they have
been articulated there is no consistency of expression, nor much clarity of
thought.
<P>

19  	The first ground has three components.  It complains that no
statement of claim was issued by the plaintiff against the defendant
and no
lawful judgment was obtained.  However, it is clear from <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/index.html#p5.4" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5.4</a> Divs 2, 3 and 4
of the Corporations Law that the procedure for the issue of a statutory demand,
followed by an application to wind
the company up in consequence of failure to
comply with the demand, is available to a plaintiff who has not sued for or
obtained
a judgment in debt.  For example, s 459Q(c) expressly contemplates
that the debt which is the subject of the application for winding
up may not be
a judgment debt, and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/index.html#p5.4" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5.4</a> Div 2 and the Rules made under it make provisions
which contemplate that a statutory demand may be made for a debt which is not a
judgment debt.
<P>

20  	The second part of the first ground of appeal is that the
correct procedure has not been followed by the Commissioner of Taxation,
in
that no notice of assessment under s 179 of the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/" class="autolink_findacts">Income Tax Assessment
Act 1936</a> (Cth) has been issued.  In this submission the defendant relies
upon<b> </b><i>Sunrise Auto Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20124%20ALR%20425" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994)
124 ALR 425</a>; (on appeal),  <i>Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Sunrise Auto
Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20133%20ALR%20274" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 133 ALR 274.</a>  The defendant has not sought to introduce new
evidence on the appeal with respect to this matter, and relies upon bare
assertion.
 The ground of appeal  must fail because this is clearly a matter
which could have been raised in an application to set aside the
statutory
demand and consequently could not be raised without leave under s 459S at the
hearing before the Deputy Registrar.  In
those circumstances it cannot be said
that the Deputy Registrar made any appealable error in this respect.
<P>

21  	The third aspect of the first ground of appeal is an assertion
that by using the statutory procedure as a `debt collection
device' the
plaintiff was guilty of an abuse of process, compounded when an application to
wind the company up was made on the basis
of the statutory demand.  The
defendant relies on<b> </b><i>Australian Mid-Eastern Club Ltd v Elbakht</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20NSWLR%20697" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 NSWLR 697</a>,<b> </b><i>Soverina Pty Limited v Jackson &amp; Associates
Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2012%20ACLR%20693" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 12 ACLR 693</a> and<b> </b><i>Re Bond Corporation Holdings Pty
Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%201%20WAR%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 1 WAR 465.</a>  The use of the statutory demand procedure for debt
collection may be objectionable as an abuse of process in cases where, for
example,
the creditor is aware that there is a genuine dispute in respect of
the debt.  But there is nothing in the law which <i>per se</i> prevents a
person who claims indebtedness from using the statutory demand procedure and
subsequently making an application for winding
up.  A creditor may well
believe, for example, that there is no point expending time and effort in
proceeding to judgment in debt
because, in the creditor's view, it is likely
that the debtor will be wound up in insolvency and that the appropriate outcome
is
that each creditor should obtain a rateable distribution out of the debtor's
assets.  The Corporations Law expressly contemplates,
in the provisions to
which I have referred, that a creditor who takes that attitude may proceed to
issue a statutory demand, and
upon failure to comply with it, make an
application for winding up.
<P>

22  	The next ground of appeal relates to an issue of sovereignty
which was the subject of the judgments of Hayne J in<b> </b><i>Joosse v
Australian Securities and Investments Commission</i><b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/78.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] HCA 78</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2073%20ALJR%20232" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 73 ALJR 232</a>
and<b> </b><i>Helljay Investments Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation</i>
 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] HCA 56</a> (7 October 1999).  As I understand this ground of appeal, it was
expressly considered by Hayne J and rejected by him, and therefore
it must fail
now.  In any event the raising of this matter at the hearing would have been
prevented by s 459S, in the absence of
leave.
<P>

23  	The third ground of appeal raises the question whether
legislation constituting the Australian Taxation Office was validly
gazetted
and promulgated as required by law.  I was informed by counsel that the issue
has also been raised in proceedings before
Hill J in the Federal Court of
Australia. I am happy for his Honour, or any other judge before whom the issue
properly arises, to
deal with it on such an occasion. The issue simply does not
arise before me since the Australian Taxation Office is not a party to
the
proceedings or a claimant creditor.  The plaintiff creditor in the present case
is the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation.  Additionally,
once again s 459S would
have been a barrier to the raising of this argument at the hearing before the
Deputy Registrar.
<P>

24  	The fourth ground of appeal raises an issue of delegation.  The
question is whether the statutory rights of the Commissioner
of Taxation have
been properly delegated to the Deputy Commissioner under relevant legislation,
having regard to the principles in<b> </b><i>O'Reilly v State Bank of Victoria
Commissioners</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1983] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%20153%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 153 CLR 1.</a>  The plaintiff contended that a proper
delegation had occurred by virtue of s 209 of the<b> </b>Income Taxation Act
1936 (Cth) and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/taa1953269/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 8</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/taa1953269/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">9</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/taa1953269/" class="autolink_findacts">Taxation Administration Act 1953</a> (Cth) and
referred to <i>James v the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1957/36.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1957] HCA 36</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281957%29%2097%20CLR%2023" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1957) 97 CLR
23</a>, <i>Spencer v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2021%20ATR%20546" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 21 ATR 546</a> and<b>
</b><i>Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (Vic) v Boxshall</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1988/355.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] FCA 355</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2019%20ATR%201822" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 19 ATR
1822.</a>
<P>

25  	It appears to me on balance that the plaintiff's submission
would be successful were it necessary for me to resolve the issue.
 I have some
hesitation because s 209, upon which the plaintiff relies, applies only to
permit any tax unpaid to `be sued for and
recovered'.  There may be an argument
that an application for winding up based on failure to comply with a statutory
demand is not
properly characterised as a proceeding by which an amount is sued
for and recovered, but is instead a proceeding for the external
administration
of an insolvent company for the benefit of its creditors and contributories
generally. However, the cases to which
the plaintiff refers appear to have
rejected that argument in the context of bankruptcy and to have assumed that it
is not available
in the context of winding up.  I would be inclined to follow
them were it necessary for me to decide in point.  It is not necessary
for me
decide this point because, once again, this is a matter which could have been
raised in an application to set aside the statutory
demand and s 459S was a
barrier to its being raised before the Deputy Registrar in the absence of
leave;  there was therefore no
appealable error by the Deputy Registrar on this
point.
<P>

26  	The fifth ground of appeal relates to the assertion that the<b>
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/" class="autolink_findacts">Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</a> (Cth) was never validly assented to by the
Governor-General of the time, Lord Gowrie, because of the absence of letters
patent during
the interregnum between the reigns of Edward VIII and George VI.
If this matter had been raised before the Deputy Registrar it would
have been
necessary for some evidence to be adduced with respect to it.  There is no
evidence before me on the appeal, but only the
assertions of counsel.  In those
circumstances, I would not regard the Deputy Registrar as having made an
appealable error even if
(contrary to the evidence in Mr Levick's affidavit)
this specific point had been taken at the hearing.  Again, it is unnecessary
for me to base my decision in the appeal on this point, because this is also a
matter which might have been raised in an application
to set aside the
statutory demand, and the barrier of s 459S applies to it.
<P>

27  	The final ground of appeal involves the assertion that the
Corporations Law of New South Wales (and presumably the Corporations
Laws of
each other State and Territory) are invalid.  As I understand it, the argument
is an extrapolation from the decision of the
High Court of Australia in<b>
</b><i>Sue v Hill</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/30.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] HCA 30</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%2073%20ALJR%201016" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 73 ALJR 1016.</a>  That case related to whether a
person who was a citizen of both Australia and the United Kingdom could validly
be certified as elected
to the Senate of the Australian Parliament.  The
election was successfully challenged in the High Court.  The judgments of their
Honours ranged over a number of matters of broader constitutional significance.
However, I find it the impossible to construct any
plausible argument which
would even suggest the possibility that in light of the judgments in that case
the Corporations Laws of
the States should be regarded as invalid.  No
plausible argument was presented to me at the hearing.  The notion underlying
the ground
of appeal seem to be that changes to our domestic law produced the
consequence, acknowledged in<b> </b><i>Sue v Hill</i><b>,</b> that Australia
attained the status of a nation by at least 1986, when the Australia Acts were
enacted.  That being so, it was somehow
unconstitutional for Acts of the
Commonwealth and State Parliaments to be assented to by the Governor-General
and Governors respectively,
because they were representatives of a foreign
sovereign.  But nothing in<i> Sue v Hill</i><b> </b>suggests that extraordinary
conclusion.  According to the law of New South Wales, which I am bound to
apply, an enactment takes effect
upon proclamation, after it has passed through
the Parliament and has been assented to by the Governor.  The Corporations Law
which
is of principal relevance in this case is the Corporations Law of New
South Wales, since the defendant was incorporated in this State.
Each of the
provisions of the Corporations Law to which I have referred is, therefore, a
provision of New South Wales law and is
valid as such.
<P>

28  	It follows that New South Wales law validly deprives the
director of the defendant of the authority to give instructions to
bring the
appeal, validly creates barriers to the appeal including s 459S, and validly
adopts provisions which make it clear that
the statutory demand procedure may
be used without the institution of proceedings for recovery or entry of a
judgment in debt.  The
appeal therefore comprehensively fails.  Any application
for a stay pending the determination of the appeal must necessarily fail,
and
no other ground for a stay was articulated at the hearing. 
<P>

29  	My orders are:
<P>

(1)	The defendant's application for a stay of the orders of the Deputy
Registrar made in paragraph 1 of the notice of motion filed
on 8 October 1999
is denied.
<P>

(2)	The appeal from the decision and orders of the Deputy Registrar made in
paragraph 2 of the notice of motion filed on 8 October
1999 is dismissed.
<P>

(3)	The defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs of the notice of motion filed on
8 October 1999.
