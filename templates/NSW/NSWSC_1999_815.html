<b>2153/99  -  BAX GLOBAL (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD  v  EVANS &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  These proceedings were commenced by summons filed on
29 April 1999, by which the plaintiff claims damages as final
relief and seeks
interlocutory orders.  The cause of action appears to relate to the conversion
of some computer equipment.  The
interlocutory orders are `Mareva orders' and
ancillary orders by way of disclosure of assets.
<P>

2  	The proceedings first came before Bergin J on an ex parte basis
on 29 April 1999.  Her Honour made the Mareva orders and made
orders for the
abridgment of time for service.  When the matter returned to her on 4 May 1999,
she extended the Mareva orders and
stood the matter over to 13 May 1999 for the
Court to consider the plaintiff's application for ancillary disclosure orders.
That
application, and the application by the second and third defendants for a
stay of proceedings, were heard by me on 13 and 21 May
1999.  On 3 June 1999,
after the Court of Appeal of New South Wales had delivered its judgment in
<i>Vasil v National Australia Bank Ltd</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/161.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCA 161</a>, I heard
supplementary submissions as to the effect of that decision.
<P>

3  	The Mareva orders, which were modified by me on 13 May on the
plaintiff's application and without contest, restrain
<P>

(a)	the first defendant from dealing with money in his name in any financial
institution, other than for living expenses not exceeding
$150 per week and
payment of certain legal expenses;
<P>

(b)	the first defendant from disposing of his Holden Commodore motor
vehicle;
<P>

(c)	the second defendant from dealing with a property at Beecroft;
<P>

(d)	the third defendant from dealing with a property at North Rocks;
<P>

(e)	the third defendant from disposing of his Nissan Skyline motor vehicle;
<P>

(f)	each defendant from moving or dealing with any computer equipment.
<P>

The orders establish a procedure should the second and third defendants' wives
wish to deal with any interest they may have in the
properties affected by the
orders.
<P>

4  	The ancillary disclosure orders sought by the plaintiff in the
summons were in two categories.  First, the summons sought an
order that each
defendant swear an affidavit setting out a list of assets owned, their
approximate value and particulars of any co-owner.
 The plaintiff no longer
seeks this order because affidavits on these matters have been provided.
Secondly, the summons sought an
order that the first and second defendants
swear affidavits setting out:
<P>

(a)	the location of specified computer-related equipment;
<P>

(b)	particulars of any assets acquired using the proceeds of sale of that
equipment;  and
<P>

(c)	the location of any such assets.
<P>

5  	The first defendant voluntarily provided such an affidavit and
gave brief oral evidence on 13 May 1999.  I issued a certificate
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (NSW) in respect of the transcript of evidence and
affidavit, and made an order restricting access to named lawyers for the
plaintiff
and the first defendant.
<P>

6  	The plaintiff now seeks orders for such an affidavit against the
third defendant as well as the second defendant.  The plaintiff
says that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a>
certificates should apply to each affidavit, that the affidavits should be
lodged with my Associate so that the certificates can
be attached, and that
thereafter they should be served on the plaintiff's solicitor in a confidential
envelope, and access should
be restricted to named lawyers for the plaintiff
and the defendants.
<P>

7  	The first issue for the Court to determine is whether to order
the second and third defendants to swear affidavits on these
matters, subject
to directions providing protection to the defendants along the lines suggested
by the plaintiff or in some other
way.  The second issue is to deal with an
application by the second and third defendants for a stay of proceedings.  The
application,
by notice of motion filed on 13 May 1999, seeks an order that
there be a stay of the present proceedings, as they affect the second
and third
defendants, `pending the resolution of their criminal law matters relating to
charges of receiving stolen property, goods
in/on premises reasonably suspected
stolen, goods in custody of other reasonably suspect stolen' (sic).
<P>

<b>Facts</b>
<P>

8  	The plaintiff manages the transportation, warehousing and customs
clearance of goods for overseas clients.  It has a warehouse
in Alexandria.  On
Monday 8 March 1999 the plaintiff's manager discovered, as a result of a stock
reconciliation, that 16 Phillips
computer monitors identified by their serial
numbers, which had been in the warehouse on Friday 5 March, were missing and
had not
been recorded as dispatched.  
<P>

9  	A review of security video tape revealed that on Sunday 7 March
the first defendant was in charge of logistical operations and
the only
Air-Road Distribution driver picking up freight on that day was the second
defendant, who picked up 14 pallet loads (28
pallets) of equipment in two
trips.  Suffice it to say that aspects of the dispatch were irregular and not
in accordance with the
plaintiff's procedures, and appeared to the plaintiff's
manager to be suspicious.  Additionally, a security video taken at Air-Road
Distribution's premises on the same day revealed that only ten pallets were
unloaded by the second defendant there, from the 14 pallets
in the second load.
The plaintiff says that the missing pallets contained 33 Phillips monitors, 33
desk top CPUs, six lap top computers
and five sets of computer speakers.  This
is the specified equipment in respect of which ancillary disclosure orders are
sought.
<P>

10  	The plaintiff reported the matter to Redfern Police on 29 March
1999, and the police have undertaken an investigation.  On
13 April 1999 the
police arrested and charged each of the defendants.  The first defendant was
charged with larceny by a servant.
 The second defendant was charged with
receiving stolen property and larceny, and the third defendant was charged with
receiving
stolen property, `goods in/on premises reasonably suspected stolen',
and `goods in custody of other reasonably suspected stolen'.
 Some of the
computer equipment was found in the garage of the property occupied by the
third defendant.  The plaintiff estimates
that the value of the equipment found
by the police is approximately $40,000, whereas the total value of the
equipment removed on
7 March 1999 is estimated at approximately $160,000.  Most
of the equipment is owned by Dell Computer Pty Ltd, the balance being
owned by
Phillips Business Electronics.
<P>

11  	The plaintiff says that approximately $30,000 worth of computer
equipment went missing from its premises on about 20 December
1998.  The
plaintiff has put forward some evidence which may implicate the first and
second defendants in the theft of that equipment.
 There is also some evidence
to suggest that the second defendant may have disposed of goods in Queensland
in March 1999.
<P>

12  	None of the defendants has revealed to the police the location
of the balance of the computer equipment.  The plaintiff says
that it has
sought relief by way of Mareva orders and ancillary disclosure orders because
of its concern that the defendants may
put their assets beyond its reach in the
event that it is successful in the proceedings for damages. 
<P>

13  	By a facsimile dated 2 June 1999 the Office of the Director of
Public Prosecutions (NSW) informed the plaintiff's solicitors
that the Director
did not desire to be heard with respect to the plaintiff's application before
me for orders for affidavits to be
filed as to property.  The letter said:
<P>

`Under no circumstances should information obtained from the affidavits or oral
evidence be supplied to this office or to police
as such disclosure would
preclude the use of that or derivative information which might otherwise be
acquired by police as a result
of their inquiries.'
<P>

14  	I cannot share the view expressed in this facsimile that the law
is now relatively well settled.  In my view substantial uncertainty
has
surrounded the availability of both Mareva orders and orders ancillary to them
ever since the English Court of Appeal invented
this form of relief in 1975:
<i>Mareva Compania Naviera SA v International Bulk Carriers SA </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 2
Lloyd's Rep 509</a>;  <i>Nippon Yusen Kaisha v Karageorgis</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1975%5d%203%20All%20ER%20282" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1975] 3 All ER 282.</a>
The uncertainty has been compounded in cases such as the present, because of
the propensity of the ancillary disclosure orders to
collide with the privilege
against self-incrimination, itself a difficult branch of the law even after the
enactment of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (NSW).  The difficulty of the law
is underlined both by the decision in <i>Vasil v National Australia Bank
Limited </i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/161.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCA 161</a> and by the fact that some important issues remain
unresolved after that decision.
<P>

15  	I shall endeavour, at least to the extent necessary to decide
the present case, to set out my understanding of the principles
concerning the
jurisdictional basis of Mareva orders and of ancillary disclosure orders, and
concerning claims based on the privilege
against self-incrimination in light of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a>, and claims for a stay of proceedings.  Then I shall consider the
application of these principles to the present case.
<P>

<b>The jurisdictional basis for Mareva orders</b>
<P>

16  	The joint judgment (Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Callinan
JJ) in <i>Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20162%20ALR%20294" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 162 ALR 294</a> deals
specifically with the availability of Mareva orders against third parties to
proceedings, but the judgment includes some fundamentally
important
observations of a more general kind.  The following propositions may be derived
from the judgment:
<P>

&#183;	broad statutory provisions which confer jurisdiction on superior courts
to make such orders as appear just and convenient
(including <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/" class="autolink_findacts">Federal Court of Australia Act 1976</a> (Cth) and (I infer) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 23</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">66</a>(4) of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a> (NSW)) do not confer an unlimited power to grant
injunctive relief, and regard must still be had to the existence of the legal
or
equitable right which the court's order protects against invasion;
<P>

&#183;	a Mareva order is best seen as a special exception to the general law
proposition that creditors cannot restrain debtors
from dealing with their
assets as they please, and should not be regarded as an injunction or any other
development of the equitable
jurisdiction to grant interlocutory relief;
<P>

&#183;	the source of the power to make Mareva orders is the court's inherent
power to prevent the abuse or frustration of its process
and to prevent
stultification of the administration of justice;
<P>

&#183;	for several reasons, great care should be taken by courts which deal
with applications for Mareva orders, especially but
not only where the
interests of third parties are involved;
<P>

&#183;	the reasons for caution include the potential impact of Mareva orders on
third parties;  the risk that by making an order
the court will confer on the
applicant excessive protection in the nature of security for payment;
difficulties with quantification
and recovery of damages pursuant to the
applicant's undertaking as to damages;  difficulties as to the identification
of trigger
events for dissolution of the injunction or entitlement to damages;
and the need to protect the respondent by ensuring through undertakings
or
otherwise that the applicant diligently prosecutes the principal proceedings
after the orders are made (see also <i>Pelechowski v The Registrar, Court of
Appeal </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] HCA 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20162%20ALR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 162 ALR 336)</a>;
<P>

&#183;	it follows that before making a Mareva order, the court should inquire
whether there is any other suitable form of interlocutory
remedy which will
meet the case in hand but be less extensive in scope (such as an order for the
appointment of a receiver).
<P>

<b>The jurisdictional basis for ancillary disclosure orders</b>
<P>

17  	The practice of making ancillary disclosure orders in support of
Mareva orders can be traced back in England to  <i>A v C </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1980%5d%202%20All%20ER%20347" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1980] 2 All ER
347.</a>  There Robert Goff J held that the power to make such ancillary orders
derived from rules of court in relation to discovery of documents
and
interrogatories, which could be used at an early stage of proceedings, and also
from a provision in the UK judicature legislation
corresponding approximately
with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66(4)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a>.  That the latter is not a source of
jurisdiction for Mareva orders in Australia has been confirmed by the High
Court in the <i>Cardile </i>case.  
<P>

18  	Consistently with the High Court's reasoning in <i>Cardile,
</i>a court at first instance ought to consider whether it is more appropriate
to invoke those procedures than to follow the newly developed
special procedure
which I shall describe.  An advantage of ordering disclosure by the
administration of verified interrogatories
is that the questions to be answered
are articulated with some precision and the procedure for objecting because of
self-incrimination
or on some other ground is clearly designated in the rules
(see, in particular, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p24" class="autolink_findacts">Part 24</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">Rules 5</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">6</a>).  
<P>

19  	However, the procedures for interrogatories and discovery are
not always available in cases where the plaintiff seeks disclosure
ancillary to
Mareva orders, as the English Court of Appeal pointed out in <i>A J Bekhor
&amp; Co Ltd v Bilton</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1981/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] EWCA Civ 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20QB%20923" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] 1 QB 923.</a>  This is because on some occasions,
the information to be disclosed about the defendant's assets is relevant to the
Mareva relief
but does not relate to the facts in issue in the proceedings.
For example, in the <i>Bekhor </i>case the proceedings related to recovery of
moneys allegedly lent by the plaintiffs to the defendant, and did not therefore
raise
any issue as to the nature or location of any particular assets of the
defendant, or of the defendant's assets generally.  One may
contrast such a
case with cases such as <i>A v C</i>, where the proceedings involved tracing of
assets and so the nature and location of at least some assets were facts in
issue in the
proceedings.  Thus, discovery and interrogatories will not always
be alternatives to `Mareva disclosure orders', especially where
the subject
matter of disclosure is a broad class of assets.
<P>

20  	In <i>Ballabil Holdings Pty Ltd v Hospital Products Ltd
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%201%20NSWLR%20155" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 1 NSWLR 155</a> the Court of Appeal of New South Wales held that this
Court has jurisdiction to make a disclosure order in aid of a Mareva order.
However the jurisdictional basis for doing so was not expressly stated.  The
judgments concentrate on whether a Mareva order can
be made in respect of
foreign assets of a resident New South Wales company, and on the fact that in
the instant case the Mareva orders
were followed by the appointment of a
receiver.  Street CJ noted (at 159) that a receiver has the power to require
discovery of assets
including foreign assets.  Glass JA held (at 164) that a
disclosure order could be made in aid of a properly drawn Mareva order,
but
gave no explicit reasons for that view.  Priestley JA held that the Court has
the jurisdiction to make a Mareva order `and it
has all the ordinary powers to
make orders for discovery' (at 165), suggesting that he may have regarded the
disclosure order in
the instant case as a routine exercise of the power to
order discovery under the then equivalent of Part 23 of the Supreme Court
Rules.  In that case a fact in issue was whether the defendant had taken assets
out of the jurisdiction between 24 and 25 October
1994.  
<P>

21  	In <i>Jackson v Sterling Industries Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/23.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 23</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20162%20CLR%20612" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 162 CLR 612</a>,
622-3 Deane J said that the power to make a Mareva order encompasses an order
requiring the disclosure by the defendant of his assets,
and an order for the
delivery up of designated assets.  He did not impose any qualification to the
effect that the power is limited
to circumstances where discovery or the
administration of interrogatories (or in the case of delivery up of assets, the
making of
interim preservation orders under Part 28 of the Supreme Court Rules)
would be appropriate.  
<P>

22  	In <i>Reid v Howard</i> both the High Court of Australia ((1995)
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=184%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">184 CLR 1)</a> and the Court of Appeal of New South Wales ((1993)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=31%20NSWLR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">31 NSWLR 298)</a>
proceeded on the basis that this Court has jurisdiction to make disclosure
orders ancillary to Mareva orders, and not merely orders
in the nature of
discovery and the administration of interrogatories under the Supreme Court
Rules.  In the Court of Appeal (at 305)
the source of the jurisdiction was said
to be <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a> (NSW), according to which this Court
has all jurisdiction necessary for the administration of justice in New South
Wales, although
the High Court (at 16-17) drew attention to the limits of that
section as a source of power.
<P>

23  	Now that <i>Cardile's </i>case has defined more precisely the
source of the jurisdiction to make the Mareva orders themselves, some
inferences can be drawn
as to the Court's jurisdiction to make ancillary
disclosure orders.  Since the source of the jurisdiction to make Mareva orders
is
the Court's inherent power to prevent abuse of its processes and
stultification of the administration of justice by the removal of
assets from
the plaintiff's reach, the Court must also have the power to order disclosure
of the nature and location of particular
assets or assets of a class so that
the Mareva relief is effective and not oppressive.  As Robert Goff J pointed
out in <i>A v C</i> (at 351), if the plaintiff does not know the number and
location of (say) the defendant's bank accounts, a Mareva order in respect
of
bank accounts generally could be oppressive both to the defendant and to the
bankers who are required to act in accordance with
it, especially where there
is more than one account or several defendants.  Without information about the
nature and location of
the defendant's assets, the plaintiff may be unable to
make the risk assessment which is necessary in order to give the undertaking
as
to damages, or if the undertaking is given, it may lead to an unexpected
exposure.  Robert Goff J concluded, as do I, that considerations
such as these
point to the conclusion that in the special cases where the court decides to
make Mareva orders, it may make such disclosure
orders as are necessary to
ensure that the Mareva jurisdiction is properly and effectively exercised.
While the power to do so does
not depend upon the statutory discovery and
interrogatory procedures, <i>Cardile </i>indicates (as I have mentioned) that
these procedures should be considered as alternative methods of compelling
disclosure, where
they are available.

<b>The privilege against self-incrimination and s 128</b>
<P>

24  	Before the High Court decided <i>Reid v Howard </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20184%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 184
CLR 1</a>, it had been contended that courts in civil proceedings had a broad
discretion to override the privilege against self-incrimination
so as to
prevent defendants from exploiting the privilege to deprive plaintiffs of their
civil rights and remedies:  see <i>Istel Ltd v Tully </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%20AC%2045" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1993] AC 45</a>, 55 per
Lord Templeman.  In <i>Reid v Howard</i> itself the Court of Appeal of New
South Wales, following a course similar to that adopted in New Zealand
(<i>Busby v Thorn EMI Video Programmes Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20NZLR%20461" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 NZLR 461)</a>, made orders
requiring disclosure subject to detailed protections designed to prevent
incriminating material from being used against
the disclosing party.  The Court
of Appeal's disclosure orders were made in support of Mareva orders in
proceedings brought by former
clients against a chartered accountant who was
alleged to have defrauded them.  There were no concurrent criminal proceedings.

<P>

25  	The High Court held that although the privilege against
self-incrimination may be abridged by statute or waived, it is otherwise
without any real exception (at 12).  The privilege is not to be modified or
abrogated in favour of some different protection by judicial
decision (at 17).
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 23</a> did not, in the opinion of the High Court, authorise the Supreme
Court to modify or abrogate the privilege against self-incrimination
(at 17),
which the High Court described as a basic and substantive common law right
which is a fundamental bulwark of liberty (at
11).
<P>

26  	<i>Reid v Howard </i>does not prevent the court from making
disclosure orders ancillary to Mareva orders, but it establishes that in the
absence of a statutory
modification or waiver, the defendant may object to
compliance with the orders by invoking the privilege.  Where the privilege is
invoked in the context of discovery or interrogatories, the Supreme Court Rules
set out the procedure for objection:  see Part 23
Rules 1(c)(ii) and 3(6)(d);
Part 24 Rules 5 and 6(3)(d).  If the person concerned wishes to claim the
privilege he or she does so
at the time when the documents are produced or the
interrogatories are required to be answered.  
<P>

27  	Where the disclosure order is not an order for discovery or the
administration of interrogatories, an issue arises as to how
to cater for the
right to object on the ground of the privilege.  This issue arose in <i>Vasil v
National Australia Bank Ltd</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/1999/161.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWCA 161.</a>  In that case the respondent
bank was the plaintiff in an action against the appellant claiming damages for
deceit.  Criminal proceedings
were commenced against the appellant.  The bank
then obtained an ex parte Mareva order restraining the appellant from removing
any
property from the jurisdiction or dealing with property otherwise than to
meet day to day living expenses and legal expenses.  The
judge also ordered the
appellant to deliver to the bank an affidavit setting out particulars of
accounts with financial institutions
and other specified information about his
property and liabilities.  The order did not make provision for any claim to
privilege
and as Stein JA pointed out, refusal to provide the affidavit on the
ground of privilege could very well have been in breach of the
order.  The
appellant applied by notice of motion for the discharge of the disclosure order
on the basis that it infringed his privilege
against self-incrimination. 
<P>

28  	Meagher JA, dissenting, held that an objection on the ground of
self-incrimination should be taken, if at all, at the time
when the information
is required to be given, and not earlier.  Since the appellant had not objected
to the provision of particular
information and had not given the grounds for
his objection, his application to discharge the disclosure order was premature.
The
majority (Stein and Fitzgerald JJA) held that the judge's disclosure order
was defective because it made no provision for the appellant
to claim the
privilege, and therefore the real effect of the disclosure order would be to
abrogate the privilege itself, contrary
to <i>Reid v Howard.</i>  The majority
took the view that where the disclosure order is inconsistent with the
privilege as expounded by <i>Reid v Howard</i>, it should be set aside even
though the party ordered to make disclosure has not supported the claim to the
privilege by sworn evidence
of the kind which would be required had the
procedures for discovery or interrogatories been followed.  Since the judge had
before
him facts which suggested the relevance of a claim to the privilege, his
order should have expressly permitted the appellant to swear
an affidavit
claiming the privilege and should not have required that the affidavit of
assets be delivered directly to the bank,
rather than to the judge in a sealed
envelope.  The Court held that although <i>Reid v Howard</i> related to the law
prior to the commencement of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a> (NSW), <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> has
not authorised the making of a disclosure order of the kind made against the
appellant.  
<P>

29  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 128(1)</a> gives a witness the statutory right to object to
giving evidence on the ground that the evidence may tend to incriminate the
witness.
 If it finds that there are reasonable grounds for the objection, the
court must not require the witness to give the evidence and
must inform the
witness that the evidence need not be given but that if it is given, the court
will issue a certificate under the
section (s 128(2)).  If a certificate is
given, the evidence and any information obtained as a direct or indirect
consequence cannot
be used against the witness <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 128(7)).</a>  However, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128(5)</a>
allows the court to require the witness to give evidence if it is satisfied of
certain things, including that `the interests of justice
require that the
witness give the evidence'.  If the court so requires, it must issue a
certificate and accordingly the evidence
is protected in the same way.  
<P>

30  	Sub-section (5) is thus a statutory provision which abridges the
privilege against self-incrimination which the High Court
had held to be
absolute in <i>Reid v Howard.</i>.  Where it applies, it subjects the privilege
to the exercise of judicial discretion.  What is envisaged, however, is not
that the
court will make elaborate orders creating a special protection regime
in substitution for the privilege, as Powell J and the Court
of Appeal had done
in <i>Reid v Howard</i>;  rather, the court simply decides whether to require
the witness to give evidence and if it does so, it must issue a certificate
which gives the witness the statutory protection set out in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128(7).</a>  The
scheme of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> implies that the statutory protection is sufficient for the
witness whose privilege is overridden unless there are special grounds
to
apprehend some prejudice not adequately addressed by the statute.  In this
sense <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> overcomes the effect of the High Court's decision in <i>Reid v
Howard</i>:  see S Odgers, <i>Uniform Evidence Law </i>(1998), p 414.  
<P>

31  	Given that according to the Court of Appeal in <i>Vasil's
</i>case, a disclosure order ancillary to a Mareva order must make some
provision to allow the disclosing party to object on the ground
of the
privilege, and should not give an unqualified direction that the evidence be
supplied to the other party, what form of order
and procedure should be used?
In <i>Vasil's </i>case (paragraphs 45 and 46) Fitzgerald J referred to the
current practice of the Equity Division.  He described the practice as
follows:
<P>

(i)	the judge makes ex parte orders which require an affidavit of assets;
<P>

(ii)	when sworn, the affidavit is brought into Court before it is filed;
<P>

(iii)	notice of the hearing at which that is to occur is given to the Director
of Public Prosecutions;
<P>

(iv)	if an objection based on the privilege against self-incrimination is taken
when the affidavit of assets is brought into Court,
the parties and the DPP are
heard on the questions raised by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a>;
<P>

(v)	the judge decides whether to give a certificate;
<P>

(vi)	if the certificate is given the affidavit may be used in the civil
proceeding and the deponent is protected by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128(7)</a> but if the certificate is
refused, the judge orders that all copies of the affidavit be surrendered and
destroyed.
<P>

32  	This is the practice which the Equity Division developed in the
following cases:  <i>HMP Industries Pty Ltd v Graham </i>(No.2728/96, Young J,
unreported, 17 July and 27 August 1996);  <i>National Australia Bank Ltd v
Rusu</i> (No.4371/96, Cohen J, unreported, 13 February 1997;  Hamilton J,
unreported, 6 April 1998 (two judgments), 7 May 1998);  <i>AMP General
Insurance Ltd v Prasad </i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/252.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 252</a> (23 March 1999) and  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/349.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC
349</a> (16 April 1999)(Hamilton J).  In <i>Rusu </i>and <i>Prasad</i> criminal
proceedings had been commenced before the issue of disclosure was determined in
the civil proceedings, and in <i>HMP Industries</i> there was a `distinct
possibility' that the defendant would be charged.
<P>

33  	As I understand the Equity Division practice, an order requiring
an affidavit of assets is not made ex parte, or at all, unless
the court is
persuaded that the order is necessary in the circumstances. Cohen J's judgment
in <i>Rusu</i> reinforces the inference to be drawn from <i>Cardile</i>, that
the Court should consider using alternative procedures for disclosure when they
are available, including the procedure for
the administration of
interrogatories.
<P>

34  	It appears from the cases that some aspects of the Equity
Division's procedure are not yet settled.  First, there is some uncertainty
as
to whether the deponent of an affidavit is a `witness' for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
128</a> unless he or she gives oral evidence.  In his first judgment in the <i>HMP
Industries</i> case Young J held that if the court compels a party to give
evidence by swearing an affidavit of assets, the deponent has the protection
of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128(7).</a>  However, in his second judgment he embraced a procedure in which the
deponent of the affidavit goes into the witness box and gives
evidence of the
truth of his affidavit, and the certificate under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> is given in respect of
the oral evidence and the affidavit which is thereby adopted.  Young J raised
the question whether a `witness'
within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> includes a person
who gives evidence by affidavit or only a person in the witness box, and
said:
<P>

`Section 128 seems to envisage the situation where a person is in the position
of objecting to giving particular evidence.  The
section also is set in the
background of the witness giving evidence with the Court having certain
discretions as to whether in all
the circumstances it should require the
witness to answer a possibly incriminating question.  This scenario suggests
that it is applicable
only where the witness is in Court.  Accordingly, what
should happen in the situation referred to in my earlier judgment, the witness
should be asked in Court for oral evidence.'
<P>

35  	In <i>Rusu </i>and <i>Prasad</i>, Hamilton J adopted a different
procedure.  The affidavit was brought into court in the possession of the
defendant, not having been
communicated to anybody else.  The affidavit was
inspected by the judge in court.  The judge then decided whether there were
reasonable
grounds for the objection for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128(2)</a> and having
made an affirmative decision on that point, gave advice to the deponent as
required by that subsection.  If the deponent
chose to give the evidence
subject to a certificate or the judge decided to require that the evidence be
given, the evidence would
be adduced by the reading of the affidavit.  Hamilton
J did not require the deponent to give oral evidence as to the contents of
the
affidavit.  In his judgment of 16 April 1999 in <i>Prasad</i>, he explained his
view thus:
<P>

`The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> is silent as to the giving of evidence in chief at trials by
affidavit, perhaps strangely in that, certainly now (and, indeed, by
1995),
evidence in chief is given at almost all trials, at least in this division, by
affidavit, and the same is substantially so
in the Federal Court of Australia.
However, because this practice subsisted at the time of the Act, in my view the
Act must be taken
to contemplate the giving of evidence in this fashion, and it
is also my view that the reading of the affidavit is the most convenient
course
in this case.'
<P>

36  	It appears to me, with respect, that although the giving of oral
evidence may be a preferable approach on occasions, the giving
of evidence by
affidavit is appropriate to attract <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> for the reasons stated by Hamilton J,
and will often be the more convenient procedure.
<P>

37  	Another uncertainty relates to the point at which the judge
should make a decision as to the issue of a certificate.  In the
<i>HPM
Industries </i>case Mareva and disclosure orders were made ex parte, with leave
to the defendant to apply to vary or discharge the disclosure order.
 On the
return date the defendant sought to discharge the order.  Young J took the view
that the best way of balancing `the public
interest in preventing people
incriminating themselves and the public interest in preventing fraudsters
spiriting away property'
was to indicate that he would be prepared to give a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
128</a> certificate in respect of the affidavit when it was prepared.  His Honour
expressed dissatisfaction with the position, however, because
in order to make
sure the defendant's rights under <i>Reid v Howard </i>were protected, he felt
obliged virtually to promise an indemnity in advance by the issue of a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a>
certificate in respect of an affidavit which had not at that stage been
prepared.  In his second judgment of 6 April 1998 in <i>Rusu </i> case,
Hamilton J made it clear that he would not make any decision under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> until
the affidavits prepared in compliance with the disclosure order had been
brought into court and inspected by him.  At that
stage he would determine,
first, whether there were reasonable grounds for the objection with respect to
the privilege, and secondly
(in the event that the evidence was not then given
voluntarily) whether to require under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128(5)</a> that the evidence be given
subject to a certificate.  He said that until then, he would have `an open
mind' as to the exercise of
those discretions.  Obviously Hamilton J's approach
is preferable for the reasons given by Young J, provided that it is consistent
with the deponent's privilege against self-incrimination, in light of <i>Reid v
Howard</i> and <i>Vasil's </i> case.
<P>

38  	There are some <i>obiter</i> remarks by Fitzgerald JA in
<i>Vasil</i> (para 46) which could be seen as casting doubt on the procedure
adopted by Hamilton J.  Fitzgerald JA raised a question as to whether
the
Equity Division practice which he had described encounters some of the
objections referred to in the majority judgment in <i>Reid v Howard </i>(184
CLR at 16-17).  There the High Court objected to the special procedure
established by the Court of Appeal's orders, on the ground
that there were no
criteria set out for the court to decide whether the plaintiff's solicitors
should be granted leave to disclose
the information contained in the affidavit,
and if it was not to be disclosed, whether it would be necessary to conduct the
proceedings
behind closed doors;  more generally, justice would not be served
by the modification of a fundamental right of general application.
 It seems to
me, with respect, that by enacting <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> the Legislature has modified the
privilege by subjecting it to the judicial discretion in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128(5)</a>, and by
creating a procedure in which the court must determine whether there are any
reasonable grounds for the objection.  Restrictions
imposed by the court on the
use and dissemination of evidence to which a certificate applies will normally
be adopted as a practical
measure to protect prosecuting authorities, rather
than as a judicial supplement to the witness' rights, which I take to be
adequately
addressed in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128(7)</a> in the absence of special circumstances.  
<P>

39  	My conclusion is that, notwithstanding Fitzgerald JA's remarks
in <i>Vasil</i>, Hamilton J's approach conforms to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> and I am at liberty to
follow it.  Specifically, it is not necessary to make a decision as to the
issue of a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> certificate before the disclosure affidavit is brought into
court and inspected by the judge.  
<P>

40  	It may be useful if I attempt to re-state what seems to me to
emerge from the cases as the Equity Division's current procedure.
 When an
application for a disclosure order is made, as an order ancillary to Mareva
orders which the Court has decided to make,
the Court must first consider
whether disclosure is necessary or appropriate to promote the purposes for
which the Mareva relief
is to be granted.  The matters relevant to the Court's
discretion to initiate a disclosure process include the breadth or specificity
of the disclosure which is sought, the availability of alternatives such as
discovery and interrogatories, the existence of other
proceedings (especially
criminal proceedings) relating to the same subject matter, and (whether there
are concurrent criminal proceedings
or not) the likelihood that the disclosure
order may be open to objection on the ground of the privilege against
self-incrimination.
 The mere existence of concurrent criminal proceedings does
not <i>ipso facto</i> prevent a disclosure order from being made, as is shown
by <i>Vasil, Rusu </i>and <i>Prasad.</i>  It may still be appropriate to
initiate the disclosure process, allowing the disclosing party to make
submissions about self-incrimination
after the affidavit has been brought into
court and inspected by the judge.  However, where specific disclosure is sought
of facts
which go to the heart of the matters to be proved at the criminal
trial, the better course may be for the court either to stay the
application
for disclosure or even to deny the motion. 
<P>

41  	If the Court decides to initiate the disclosure process, the
procedure which it chooses is likely to depend on whether, on
the one hand, an
objection to disclosure based on the privilege against self-incrimination has
been taken or is a real possibility,
or on the other hand the disclosure order
is unlikely in the circumstances to raise any question about
self-incrimination.  In the
latter case, it is enough simply to express the
order to be subject to any claim of privilege against self-incrimination, as
Hodgson
J did initially in <i>Reid v Howard</i>.  In the former case, it is
more appropriate to use the fuller procedure which I shall describe.
<P>

42  	The Court initiates the disclosure procedure by making an order
that a disclosure affidavit be prepared and delivered to the
judge's associate
in a sealed envelope, together with directions that the affidavit not be filed
or served on any other party, and
that the further hearing be notified to the
Director of Public Prosecutions.  At that hearing the judge opens the envelope
and inspects
the affidavit.  Any affidavit or oral evidence to support the
witness' objection is then adduced, and submissions are heard as to
whether for
the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128(2)</a> there are reasonable grounds for the objection, even
though at that stage the plaintiff's counsel has not had access to the
affidavit
which is the subject of the objection.  The judge then rules on that
question.  
<P>

43  	If the decision is that there are no reasonable grounds for the
objection, the witness' obligation to comply with the disclosure
order remains
and must be satisfied.  If there are reasonable grounds for the objection, then
the Court gives the witness the warning
required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128(2).</a>  If the witness
chooses to give the evidence after hearing the warning, the Court directs that
copies of the affidavit be provided
to the legal representatives of the other
parties, but that the contents not be disclosed to any other person.  The
affidavit is
formally read and objections to admissibility are taken in the
normal way.  If there is a risk that this process will disclose the
contents of
the affidavit to persons other than the deponent and the legal representatives
of the parties, it may be necessary for
the court to be closed during this
process.  Once the affidavit has been read, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> certificate is given and
attached to it.
<P>

44  	If the witness elects not to give the evidence, then the Court
hears any further submissions as to whether it should require
the witness to
give the evidence under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128(5)</a>, and makes a determination accordingly.  If
the Court decides to require the witness to give the evidence, then it follows
the procedure
for the reading of the affidavit as outlined above.  If the Court
decides not to require the witness to give the evidence, the judge
directs that
all copies of the affidavit be returned to the witness' legal representative
and authorises their destruction.
<P>

45  	Where evidence is given to which a certificate applies, the
witness is protected by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128(7)</a> and there is a risk to the prosecuting
authorities that their evidence in the criminal proceedings may be corrupted by
knowledge
of the witness' civil evidence.  For at least that reason, steps
should be taken to limit the use and dissemination of the protected
evidence.
In the <i>HPM Industries</i> case Young J agreed that the appropriate procedure
was to permit only the plaintiff's lawyers to see the information, subject to
conditions set by the Court.  As I have mentioned, there may on occasions be a
special risk of prejudice to the witness even though
a certificate is given,
also justifying orders restricting the inspection of the evidence.
<P>

46  	The procedure which I have described involves the Court
inspecting the affidavit before deciding whether the contents of the
affidavit
must be given in evidence.  It also involves the legal representatives of other
parties having access to the affidavit,
although only after the deponent has
decided to give the evidence or the Court has decided to require that the
evidence be given.
 In my opinion this procedure is appropriate, and some such
course is necessary, in order to comply with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a>, even in light of <i>Reid v
Howard </i>and <i>Vasil</i>. 
<P>

<b>Stay of proceedings</b>
<P>

47  	This Court has the power to control its own proceedings and in
particular, it has the power to stay proceedings before it in
the interests of
justice.  In an appropriate case the Court may stay civil proceedings before it
in order to avoid the risk that
those proceedings may create an injustice to a
litigant who is standing trial for offences arising out of the same set of
facts with
which the civil proceedings are concerned:  <i>Oades v Hamilton</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2011%20NSWLR%20139" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 11 NSWLR 139.</a> 
<P>

48  	In <i>McMahon v Gould</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%201%20ACLC%2098" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 1 ACLC 98</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=7%20ACLR%20202" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">7 ACLR 202</a> a
defendant in civil misfeasance proceedings, brought by the liquidator of a
company of which he had been a director, sought a stay
of those proceedings
pending determination of criminal proceedings against him which arose out of
the same facts.  Wootten J held
that the burden was on the defendant to show
that it was in the interests of justice that the plaintiff's rights to have his
civil
action tried in the ordinary course should be interfered with.  One
matter to be considered is whether the continuance of the civil
proceedings
would create a real risk of unjust prejudice to the defendant by undermining
his privilege against self-incrimination.
 Wootten J referred to ss 178 and 179
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a> (NSW), the effect of which is that a person accused of
any of the offences in ss 165 to 176 (relating to frauds by agents) cannot
invoke the privilege to avoid discovery or interrogatories in a civil
proceeding but is protected from conviction if he first discloses
his act or
omission under compulsory civil process.  Although some of the charges against
the defendant were not within ss 165-176,
Wootten J found that the policy
underlying ss 177 and 178 cannot logically be confined to the offences in ss
165-176, and that it
would be proper to have regard to that policy in the case
before him, by weighing against the application for a stay of proceedings
`the
importance in the public interest that persons entrusted with property on
behalf of others should be compelled to account without
undue delay for their
dealings with the property' (1 ACLC at 105).  He therefore refused the stay of
proceedings.
<P>

49  	On the other hand, in <i>Oades v Hamilton</i> the Court of
Appeal of New South Wales restricted civil proceedings in order to protect the
appellant's privilege against self-incrimination.
 In that case an order had
been made for the appellant to be examined by the liquidator of a company with
which he had been connected.
 Before the examination was held, criminal charges
were laid against the appellant in relation to that company.  The Companies
Code
provided that a witness in an examination was not excused from answering
questions on the ground of the privilege against self-incrimination
but where
the privilege was claimed, the answer was not admissible in evidence against
the witness in criminal proceedings.  At first
instance McLelland J placed
weight on the legislative policy evident in the Companies Code and held that
there was no legitimate
basis for excluding from the scope of the examination
matters which were the subject of pending criminal proceedings.  The Court
of
Appeal disagreed.  Clarke JA said (11 NSWLR at 153):
<P>

`Once a charge is laid an accused person is, statutory exceptions apart,
entitled to all the protection afforded by well established
principles of the
criminal law.  In particular he is not required to submit to pre-trial
interrogation, nor is he amenable to the
subpoena process.  The Crown is
obliged to prove the case against him and he is not required to assist the
prosecution or to disclose
his defence.  
<P>

It follows that the exposure of a person charged with a criminal defence to
questioning which may lead to the furnishing of incriminating
answers in
respect of matters at the heart of the criminal charge may cause significant
prejudice to the examinee and constitute
a real interference with the
administration of criminal justice.'
<P>

50  	The Court of Appeal held that the appellant was entitled to an
order that the examiner be restrained from asking questions
which may elicit
answers which are incriminating and which go to the heart of one or other of
the charges.  Although the Court of
Appeal's decision was reversed by the High
Court of Australia ((1989) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=166%20CLR%20486" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">166 CLR 486)</a>, it seems to me that nothing in the
High Court's judgments is inconsistent with Clarke JA's statement of principles
quoted above,
the thrust of the judgment being that s 541 of the Companies Code
is a special provision which overrides the principles of the kind
set out by
Clarke JA (see 166 CLR at 497, 502-3).  Section 541 is obviously
distinguishable from <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>, since the latter does not
require disclosure but merely gives the court a discretion to do so.
<P>

51  	There are some differences of emphasis between the judgments of
Clarke JA and Wootten J, the latter having some similarities
with the judgment
of McLelland J which was overturned by the Court of Appeal.  But the cases
stand together because the unsuccessful
application in <i>McMahon v Gould
</i>was to stay the civil proceeding generally because of a number of perceived
risks to the defendant's privilege which the Court held
to be insubstantial;
whereas in <i>Oades v Hamilton</i> the Court of Appeal declined to stay the
examination proceedings but made orders designed to prevent the examiner from
asking particular
questions which, going to heart of the criminal matters,
would imperil the defendant's privilege.  
<P>

<b>The present case</b>
<P>

52  	The most striking feature of the present case is that the
disclosure which the plaintiff now seeks is very closely connected
with the
pending criminal charges.  An element of the offences with which the second and
third defendants have been charged is the
unlawful taking or retaining of
possession of goods.  There is very real risk that the defendants would be
prejudiced in their defences
to the criminal charges if they are required to
disclose the location of the computer equipment which is the subject of the
charges,
or the proceeds of sale.  Although the disclosure would be protected
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128(7)</a>, the fact of disclosure would be likely as a practical matter to
affect the defendants' conduct of their criminal trials.  For example,
if they
disclosed the location of the computer equipment in the civil proceedings, the
exercise of their right to put the Crown to
proof of that matter in the
criminal trials could well be compromised.  Knowing that the disclosure had
been made, they would inevitably
be concerned that the substance of it would
become known to the prosecutors notwithstanding the protection in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128(7)</a>, and
this would be likely to impose constraints on their preparation for the trial.
Further, if disclosure orders are made and complied
with and subsequently the
police discover the location of the computer equipment, difficult factual and
legal questions could well
arise as to the admissibility of evidence of that
discovery having regard to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128(7).</a>
<P>

53  	The parties made competing submissions as to whether it would be
consistent with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128(7)</a> for the Crown to make use of the disclosure affidavits
in cross-examination in the criminal proceedings in the event that the
deponents
give evidence in those proceedings.  It seems to me unnecessary to
resolve that issue, although I am inclined to think that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128(7)</a> would apply
to prevent the affidavit from being used in hostile cross-examination of the
deponent, even though the affidavit is not
put into evidence.  But for present
purposes it is enough to say that there is a plausible view that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128(7)</a> would
not prevent the use of the affidavit in cross-examination.  That being so, it
is obvious that the provision of an affidavit
would affect the defendants'
preparation of defences and tactics for the trial, including their decisions as
to whether they will
give evidence.
<P>

54  	It seems to me that the best way of avoiding difficulties of
these kinds is not make any disclosure order, at least until the
determination
of the criminal proceedings.  In the meantime the plaintiff will have the
protection of the Mareva orders which are
already in place, including the order
which restrains each defendant from moving or dealing with any computer
equipment.  The evidence
before me indicates that the value of the assets of
the second and third defendants together exceeds the value of the plaintiff's
claim, although the value of the plaintiff's claim exceeds the separate value
of the assets of the second and third defendants to
which the orders relate.
In the circumstances it seems to me that the Mareva orders give the plaintiff a
significant level of protection,
even it falls short of complete security.
Making a disclosure order at this stage of the present case would be
inconsistent with
the public policy which underlies the privilege against
self-incrimination, as expounded by the High Court in <i>Reid v Howard,</i> as
well as the protections of the criminal law outlined by Clarke JA in <i>Oades v
Hamilton</i>.  My decision on this point is consistent with Hungerford J's
decision in <i>Aslanis v Brambles Australia Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2082%20IR%20220" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 82 IR 220</a>, although
with respect, his observations at 235 may understate the effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s128.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 128</a> on the
<i>Reid v Howard</i> doctrine.
<P>

55  	The defendants submit that I should give effect to this view by
making orders staying the civil proceeding as a whole pending
the determination
of the criminal matters.  I do not believe it is necessary to go this far.
Resolution of the criminal proceedings
could take a substantial time and in the
meantime, a stay would prevent the plaintiff from making progress towards the
trial of civil
proceedings and obtaining its natural priority in the list.  The
defendants say that if pleadings are ordered, they would be prejudiced
in
preparing verified defences, and that even if pleadings are not required,
difficulties concerning self-incrimination could arise
in the supply of
particulars and in the preparation of filing affidavits by way of defence.  It
seems to me that such problems may
or may not arise, and the appropriate time
to deal with them is when they occur rather than when they are merely
possibilities.
<P>

56  	Three options remain available to me for the implementation of
my view that the disclosure which the plaintiff seeks should
not be required at
this stage.  I could simply deny the plaintiff's motion that orders be made in
terms of paragraphs 6(b), (c) and
(d) of the Summons; or I could stay the
plaintiff's application for this relief, or I could initiate the disclosure
process to the
point of requiring that affidavits in sealed envelopes be
supplied, but then stay the application so that no further steps would
be
taken.  If I pursue the second or the third option, the order for a stay would
be expressed to operate until further order, with
liberty to apply. 
<P>

57  	On balance, I have decided that the most appropriate course is
to stay the application for orders under paragraph 6(b) (c)
and (d) of the
Summons until further order, with liberty to apply.  It seems to me that the
potential prejudice to the defendants
with respect to the criminal proceedings
arises as soon as their affidavits are supplied to the Court, because the
contents of the
affidavits will necessarily have a practical effect on their
preparation and tactics for the conduct of their defences at the trials.
 By
staying the application with liberty to apply, rather than dismissing it, I
leave open the possibility that the plaintiff may
expeditiously raise any such
matters, and restore the application if there is a good reason to do so.  I
prefer not to dismiss the
application entirely, because disclosure orders could
well become appropriate if (for example) the criminal proceedings are
concluded,
or it emerges that the defences to the criminal proceedings are
consistent with the disclosure which the plaintiff seeks. 
<P>

58  	If the plaintiff exercises the liberty to apply in order to
restore the application, an issue for consideration will be whether
the
administration of interrogatories would be a more appropriate procedure than
special disclosure orders ancillary to Mareva relief.
 Interrogatories may well
be preferable.  If the plaintiff were to seek to administer interrogatories
forthwith after delivery of
my reasons for judgment, presumably it would be
faced with an objection on the ground of the privilege and consistently with
the
reasoning in this judgment, any application for an order that
interrogatories be answered would be stayed.
<P>

59  	I therefore propose to order that the plaintiff's application,
made at the hearing on 13 May 1999, for orders in terms of paragraph
6(b)(c)
and (d) of the Summons be stayed pending further order, and that each party
have liberty to apply to the Equity Duty Judge
on, say, 48 hours' notice.  I
shall hear the parties' submissions on the question of costs.
