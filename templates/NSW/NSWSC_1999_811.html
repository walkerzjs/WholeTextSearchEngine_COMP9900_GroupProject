1978</a></i> - <i>Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990)</i>)</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR: On 19 March 1999 before Barr J, Lance Vivian
Stephens was indicted for murder and pleaded not guilty.
<P>

2   	Before me at Grafton on 2 July Mr Stephens adhered to his
plea.
<P>

3   	On 28 June 1999, on the advice of his solicitor and
counsel, Mr Stephens, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/s32.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 32(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Procedure Act
1986</a></i> signed an election to be tried by judge alone.
<P>

4   	I was informed by counsel, both the Crown Prosecutor and Mr
Nicholson, QC, for the accused that no question of any unfitness
for trial or
to plead existed.
<P>

5   	There are two issues to be determined.  First, whether
beyond reasonable doubt on 7 July 1997 at Yamba the accused murdered
William
Alfred Stephens, his father.  The relevant elements of that offence are whether
the death of Mr Stephens senior was caused
by an act of the accused in stabbing
and hitting the victim on the head with a hammer, and whether that act was done
with the intention
to kill or cause really serious bodily injury.
<P>

6   	The second issue is the defence of mental illness.  The
onus is on the accused to satisfy the court on the balance of probabilities
that the defence is made out.
<P>

7   	I heard no oral testimony.  The evidence is constituted by
exhibit A, which comprises the Crown brief made up of statements
of
investigating police officers; the transcript of an electronically recorded
interview between Detective Senior Constable Barry
Smith and the accused at
Ballina Police Station on 4 July 1997; a lengthy statement of Alma Marguerete
Stephens dated 8 July 1997,
the mother of the accused.  There is included in
the Crown brief matters of physical evidence, including the post-mortem report
and
two reports of Dr Robert Delaforce, forensic psychiatrist, each dated 1
July 1999.
<P>

8   	As to the first component, namely the offence of murder,
very briefly stated, the facts are that at about 3.50am at the home
of his
parents the accused came into dispute with his father.  The accused struck his
father three times to the head with a claw
hammer and then stabbed him in the
chest and abdomen with a knife.
<P>

9   	The circumstances leading to this act of violence are set
out in Mrs Stephens' statement and need not here be repeated.  They
eloquently
speak of both violence and tragedy.
<P>

10   	 It is quite clear to me beyond reasonable doubt that it
was the act of the accused in beating his father on the head with
a hammer and
twice stabbing him that brought about the death.  The material in Mrs
Stephens's statement and the final autopsy report
prepared by Dr Botterill are
conclusive.
<P>

11   	That it was the accused's intention to kill his father is
clear from the nature of the blows struck and from such statements
as he made
as to the reason therefor, being a belief, shortly stated, that he and his
parents were at risk of harm and that he was
going to be killed by his parents.
The factor, outside the area of mental illness, which on the material available
to me clearly
brought about the violence was certain perceptions the accused
had upon seeing Cortisone ampoules being prescribed medication for
his
mother.
<P>

12   	The material tendered in evidence, which I accept, not
only discloses that each of the required elements of the offence of
murder has
been proved beyond reasonable doubt, but that there is available no other
matter required to be excluded beyond reasonable
doubt by the Crown to
establish what in the normal course would be guilt of the crime of murder.
<P>

13   	I turn therefore to the second component, namely the
defence of mental illness.  The classic statement of that defence was
made 156
years ago in <b><i>Regina v McNaughton</i></b> (1853) 8 ER 718 at 722.  It has
been authoritatively amplified in this country by Dixon J in directing a jury
in <b><i>Rex v Porter</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1933/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1933] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281933%29%2055%20CLR%20182" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1933) 55 CLR 182</a> at 189-190.  The High Court
affirmed the principle in <b><i>Rex v Sodeman </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281943%29%2055%20CLR%20191" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1943) 55 CLR 191</a> at
215.
<P>

14   	The test can be shortly stated:  that the accused has to
prove on the balance of probabilities that he was labouring under
such a defect
of reason from a disease of the mind so as not to know the nature and quality
of the act he was doing, or if he did
know it, that he did not know what he was
doing was wrong.  As Sir Owen Dixon said in <b><i>Porter</i></b> at 189-190:
<P>

<i>"If through the disordered condition of the mind...the accused...could not
reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense
and composure, it may
be said that he could know that what he was doing was wrong.  What is meant by,
&#180;wrong'? What is meant
by wrong is wrong having regard to the every day
standards of reasonable people."</i>
<P>

15   	These classic and fundamental statements of the law
relating to mental illness in this context have recently been considered
by
Newman J in <b><i>Regina v Gavranovik</i></b> (NSW SC 205, unreported, 12 March
1999); Hidden J in <b><i>Regina v John Charles Maxwell </i></b>(NSW SC 281,
unreported, 30 March 1999); and Greg James J in <b><i>Regina v Christian
Matthew Gillet </i></b>(NSW SC 115, unreported, 24 February 1999); and R v
Geoffrey Williams Noyes (NSW SC 397, unreported, 27 April 1999).
<P>

16   	The most eloquent summary of the psychiatric evidence is
in fact contained in a report tendered by the Crown, being that of
Dr Delaforce
of 1 July 1999 in which he concluded:
<P>

<i>"At the time that Mr Stephens killed his father Mr Lance Stephens was
suffering from schizophrenia with its florid grandiose persecutory
delusions
that included his delusional  belief that not only was he and his parents at
risk of harm, including by invisible snakes
and beams from outerspace, but that
he was going to be killed by his parents.  Because of his delusional thinking
at the time that
he killed his father he was not able to, as a result of
schizophrenia, reason with some moderate degree of calmness in relation to
the
moral quality of what he was doing at the time.  Consequently he was prevented
as a result of a defect of reason caused by schizophrenia
from knowing that
what he was doing was wrong. I would therefore support the defence of mental
illness to the charge of murder."</i>
<P>

17   	Exhibit A is a folder containing five medical reports
tendered for the defendant.  To each of those reports together with
the Crown
brief Dr Delaforce had reference.
<P>

18   	As Mr Nicholson QC remarked on 2 July 1999, his
submissions for his client on the law are, "<i>as one</i>" with the those of
the Crown and it seems to me that inexorably the conclusion must be reached
that on the balance of probabilities,
taking into account especially the
psychiatric evidence tendered by the Crown, that the position of the defence
and the Crown are
again, "<i>as one",</i> that the defence of mental illness
has been established.  
<P>

19   	There is a uniformity of opinion disclosed in the
psychiatric evidence both for the defence and the Crown that at the relevant
time the accused was suffering from mental illness constituted by paranoid
schizophrenia, which at the crucial moment had reached
that stage as described
by Dr Delaforce set out above.  As was described by Dr Corcos, Senior Registrar
in Forensic Psychiatry at
Long Bay Corrections Health Service in his report of
17 September 1997 (part of exhibit 1), the accused had, "<i>bizarre and very
distressing persecutory delusions</i>" and was, "<i>floridly psychotic at the
time of the offence</i>" as a result of the chronic paranoid schizophrenia.
<P>

20   	In the extraordinary circumstances of this case in the
light of the thoroughness of the personal and psychiatric history exposed
in
the material tendered for the accused and in that for the Crown, I need say no
more, that I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities
that the defence of
mental illness has been made out.
<P>

21   	I am satisfied therefore that it is appropriate that a
special verdict be recorded pursuant to s 38 of the <i>Mental Health (Criminal
Procedure) Act 1990</i>, namely that the accused is not guilty of murder by
reason of mental illness.
<P>

22   	There remains to be determined the nature of the order to
be made pursuant to s 39 of that legislation.
<P>

23   	It is appropriate however, at this point that I deal with
what I see as required by s 37 of that act.
<P>

24   	Following the making of an order under s 39 of the
<i>Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act</i>, Mr Stephens will come under the
supervision of a body known as the Mental Health Review Tribunal.  It is
comprised of a president
or a deputy president who has qualifications as a
barrister or solicitor and two other members, one of whom must be a
psychiatrist
and the other of whom must be a person having suitable
qualifications and experience to serve on that body.  After the special verdict
the Tribunal will commence a review of Mr  Stephens's case at the conclusion of
which it may make recommendations to the Minister
for Health.  The
recommendation could be either unconditional or subject to conditions as to the
manner in which any detention to
which Mr Stephens is subject should continue
thereafter and as to his treatment.  If the Tribunal was satisfied, but only if
it was
satisfied, that neither his safety nor that of any member of the public
would be seriously endangered by his release, it could make
a recommendation
for his release.  If it makes such a recommendation, that would be considered
by the Department of Health, which
in turn would advise the Governor.  The
Governor, in accordance with that recommendation and advice, could either make
an order for
the detention or for the release, conditional or unconditional, of
Mr Stephens.  The Governor can only make an order for release
when the Tribunal
itself has recommended release.
<P>

25   	After that first hearing of the Tribunal, the Tribunal can
at any later time, and must at least once every six months, review
the case.
After hearing evidence at a later review it could make a recommendation to the
Minister as to the continued circumstances
of detention, care or treatment or
as to release, conditional or unconditional.  The Tribunal would not be free at
any such review
to make a recommendation for release unless it is satisfied
that Mr Stephens' safety or that of any member of the public would not
be
seriously endangered by that release.  Again, following such a review or
recommendation the matter would go to the Department
of Health and the Minister
would advise the Governor.  Any recommendations so advised would only be
carried into effect by the order
of the Governor.
<P>

26   	If from circumstances of detention Mr Stephens was
released back into the public on conditions and it appeared that a breach
of
those conditions took place then the Governor may order that he be apprehended
and detained.  Such an order would follow by reason
of the practical
consideration that if a person is released the Department of Health would
maintain a watch over his case with the
assistance of a community health
centre, a private psychiatrist or one of the other public facilities available.
If a person is released
conditionally back into the community he is subject to
the maintenance of that watch over him by the Department and breach would
result in the apprehension and detention once again.
<P>

27   	The conditions upon release include residence, medication
and so on to ensure that Mr Stephens was properly cared for and
the members of
the public were protected.
<P>

28   	Unless otherwise released conditionally or
unconditionally, Mr Stephens will be a forensic patient subject to the
appropriate
detention.
<P>

29   	The only way in which a person can cease to be a forensic
patient is when he is unconditionally released by the Governor or
is released
upon conditions which include a condition as to the time that his release
should become unconditional.  If that time
expires, then his release becomes
unconditional and he ceases to be a forensic patient.
<P>

30   	Mr Stephens can never be released until the Mental Health
Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence available to it that his safety
and the
safety of any member of the public  would not be seriously endangered.
<P>

31   	Consequent upon the special verdict an order is to be made
under s 39 of the <i>Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act</i>.  That section
provides:
<P>

<i>"39.	If, on the trial of a person charged with an offence, the jury returns
a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty
by reason of mental
illness, the Court must order that the person be detained in such place and in
such manner as the Court thinks
fit until released by due process of
law".</i>
<P>

32   	The section results from an amendment in 1997 which
eliminated the requirement that a person the subject of a special verdict
was
to be placed in, <i>"strict custody</i>". The purpose of the amendment was to
eliminate that wording of the section to enable the person who has received a
special verdict
to be placed otherwise within that custody constituted by
gaol.
<P>

33   	The section was recently considered by her Honour Judge
Karpin in <i>Regina v Keskus </i>on 22 April 1998, her decision being
unreported.  Her Honour's professional association with this area of the law is
well-known. 
Her Honour appears to have granted bail, "<i>pending the initial
determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal</i>" (p 11). Her Honour's
course was followed by Williams DCJ in <b><i>Regina v J C Hill</i></b> (3
December 1998).
<P>

34   	Having considered the <i>Mental Health (Criminal
Procedure) Act</i> and having considered the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ba197841/" class="autolink_findacts">Bail Act</a></i> I am of the view,
with great respect, that the mechanism of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ba197841/" class="autolink_findacts">Bail Act</a></i> is simply not
available to effect that "<i>detention</i>" now referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ba197841/s39.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 39.</a>
<P>

35   	Further, I am of the view that on its proper construction
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ba197841/s39.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 39</a> does not permit of any form of cognate conditional release.  The matter
has not been considered at first instance by this court,
or by the appellate
jurisdiction.  But if I might say so, this very case, if considered appropriate
by others, might be drawn to
the attention of the Law Reform authorities for
the consideration of either further amendment to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ba197841/s39.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 39</a> or more particularly a
specific provision in the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ba197841/" class="autolink_findacts">Bail Act</a></i>.  
<P>

36   	The problem has become acute as exemplified in this case,
which is a "<i>country"</i> case.  The fact that such cases occur is often
overlooked by the people in the capital and the drafters of legislation
notwithstanding
the otherwise expressed high motives in their endeavours.  The
practicalities often simply cannot accommodate the section, or the
section
cannot accommodate the practicalities.
<P>

37   	It would not accord with the spirit of the purpose of the
amendment in this type of case, if I might say so, if upon the finding
of a
special verdict the making of an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ba197841/s39.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 39</a>, the detainee was found in an
environment, at least by reason of practical problems, contra-indicated by all
the psychiatric evidence
and one that is capable of being productive of the
undoing of the good that hitherto appears to have been done in this case.
<P>

38   	In the absence of appellate authority in particular, (and
taking into account the very circumstances of this trial itself
being in the
country) an opportunity, if I may put it this way, has not arisen for the
examination of the proposition of whether
"<i>detention"</i>, as that word is
referred to in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ba197841/s39.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 39</a>, can be defined in such a way as to permit the detaining of
the person subject to a special verdict  in circumstances involving conditions,
obligations, residence, curfew, association, attendance for medical treatment,
cognate with those presently available under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ba197841/" class="autolink_findacts">Bail Act</a></i>.  It may be
that another case will provide an opportunity of what I consider to be the
importance of that question to be resolved.
<P>

39   	Pursuant to s 39 of the <i>Mental Health (Criminal
Procedure) Act 1990</i> I order that Lance Vivian Stephens be detained at the
Richmond Clinic, Lismore Base Hospital.
<P>

40   	I further order that he comply with the directions of the
medical staff thereof and any other medical practitioner whose services
he
seeks.
<P>

41   	Until further order, he is there to remain until released
by due process of law.
