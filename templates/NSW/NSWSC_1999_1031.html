<b><u>10635/99 - DIRECTOR GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES v WOLFGANG
HOUDEK AND ORS</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	<b>HER HONOUR</b>:  By these proceedings, the plaintiff,
the Director General of the Department of Community Services, seeks by summons
filed on 19
March 1999, firstly, a declaration that the order for costs made by
the third defendant, a magistrate exercising jurisdiction under
the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/" class="autolink_findacts">Children
(Care and Protection) Act</a></b> 1987 against the plaintiff on 16 November 1998 is
void and of no effect.  Secondly, a declaration that the third defendant lacked
jurisdiction to make an order for costs in favour of the first and second
defendants.  Consequential orders are also sought as set
out in the summons.
<P>

2   	The third defendant, the magistrate, and the fourth
defendant, the Clerk of the Campsie Children's Court, have both entered
submitting appearances.  The second defendant, Ling Lin Houdek, has, so I am
informed by the parties, indicated that she has no interest
in the subject
proceedings.
<P>

3   	As is clear by reference to the terms of the second
declaration sought in the plaintiff's summons, it is the plaintiff's submission
that the learned magistrate did not have jurisdiction to make the order for
costs which she purported to do in the proceedings on
16 November 1998.
<P>

4   	A deal of affidavit evidence was placed before me on the
hearing of this matter.  It is not necessary for me to refer to it
in detail
since there was a large measure of agreement between the parties as to the
relevant facts. 
<P>

5   	On 4 March 1998 the plaintiff filed in the Children's Court
at Campsie a care application pursuant to s 57 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Care and
Protection) Act</a></b> in relation to Michael Houdek, an infant then aged about 18
months.  On 11 March 1998 the court found that the child was in need
of care
within the meaning of that Act.  The proceedings were adjourned to 3 April 1998
and an order made that the child remain in
the care of the Director General.
<P>

6   	On 3 April 1998 the proceedings were again before the
Children's Court.  On that date a report was placed before the court
dated 2
April 1998 prepared by Mr Abdullah, a District Officer with the carriage of the
proceedings on behalf of the plaintiff. 
Mr Abdullah recommended in the body of
that report that an order pursuant to s 72(1)(c)(ii) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Care
and Protection) Act</a></b> be made placing the child in the care of his father for
a period of 12 months upon the father making certain undertakings.  
<P>

7   	Thereafter the proceedings were further adjourned on
occasions.
<P>

8   	Mr Abdullah commenced a period of extended leave on 10
August 1998.  Another District Officer in the employ of the plaintiff,
Ms
Spiliotopoulos, took over the conduct of the matter.
<P>

9   	On 9 September 1998 the proceedings were again before the
court.  On that occasion the plaintiff was represented by Ms Fairley,
solicitor.  An updated report prepared by Ms Spiliotopoulos was tendered on
that occasion.  In that report which bore the date 9
September 1998 a
recommendation that an order pursuant to s 72(1)(c)(ii) placing the child in
the care of his father for a period
of 12 months upon the giving of certain
undertakings was again made. The proceedings were adjourned to 30 September
1998.
<P>

10   	On 30 September 1998 Ms Fairley again appeared on behalf
of the plaintiff.  A transcript of the proceedings on that day is
in evidence
before me.  At the commencement of the proceedings Ms Fairley informed the
court of the following matters:
<P>

"My instructions are that the child be placed in the custody of his father.
The department had recommended 12 months and the father
has indicated that he
wanted until 18 and the department is agreeable to that proposition.  The
undertakings remain the same as before."
<P>

11   	The transcript goes on to record that Mr McLachlan, who
appeared on behalf of the father, observed that it appeared, having
regard to
the contents of Ms Fairley's statement, that the Department had accepted
submissions which he had made to it in writing.
<P>

12   	The solicitor who appeared on behalf of the child's mother
indicated that she was not in a position to advise the court as
to her client's
instructions.  However, she asserted her belief that her client was unlikely to
agree to the proposed order, namely
that the child be placed in the custody of
his father until he attained the age of 18 years, and she foreshadowed that the
matter
may have to proceed to a hearing.
<P>

13   	It is clear from a reading of the transcript of 30
September 1998 that the assertion by Ms Fairley that the Department was
agreeable to the orders sought by the father had introduced a new element.
<P>

14   	Having regard to the submission made by Ms Rowley on
behalf of the mother that it was likely that the matter would now need
to
proceed to hearing, the magistrate proceeded to  make a number of directions.
Those are recorded at page 4 of the transcript:
<P>

"Department to file the orders now sought within 14 days together with a list
of documents that it relies on or proposes to rely
on for hearing.  Father to
file his affidavits that he proposes to rely on within 7 days thereafter
together with notice of witnesses
required for cross-examination.  Mother to
file 7 days thereafter together again with notice of witnesses required for
cross-examination."
<P>

15   	Her Worship fixed a date for hearing on 14 December
1998.
<P>

16   	On 1 October 1998 Mr McLachlan wrote to the Assistant
Manager of the plaintiff's Marrickville office noting the order that
the court
had made, namely that the Department file and serve its material within 14
days.  Mr McLachlan went on to ask if the material
might be sent by facsimile
to his North Sydney office to ensure compliance by his firm with the court's
direction to file material
on behalf of the father within 7 days.
<P>

17   	It is to be noted that in her affidavit Ms Spiliotopoulos
states that she did not attend the Children's Court on 30 September
1998 when
the magistrate made the subject orders.  She asserts that throughout the time
she had the carriage of the matter it was
her understanding that the Department
at all times maintained it was seeking a 12 month custody order in favour of
the father.  She
goes on to say in the concluding paragraph of her affidavit
that on or around 1 October 1998, "I received a letter from Ellis McLachlan
in
relation to the care proceedings".
<P>

18   	She annexes a copy of the letter to which I made reference
a few moments ago.  She does not disclose what, if any, action
she took in
relation to the receipt of that letter.  It appears that the Department did not
respond to it.
<P>

19   	Mr McLachlan on 27 October, almost two weeks after the
expiration of the time period imposed on the plaintiff by the magistrate's
directions, wrote a further letter to the plaintiff.  That letter is an
annexure to the affidavit of Mr McLachlan.  It is in these
terms:
<P>

"We refer to our letter of 1 October 1998, a copy of which is attached.  We do
not appear to have been served with the department's
material to enable us to
in turn file our client's material.  We note the court gave very clear
directions on 30 September and the
department's known breach of those
directions.  Unless we receive those materials  within the next 48 hours, we
shall seek to re-list
the matter to ask the court for further directions,
including a direction in relation to costs.  We trust that will not be
necessary."
<P>

20   	A further annexure to the affidavit of Mr McLachlan is a
copy of a letter apparently sent to Mr Abdullah dated 30 October
1998 and
prepared by Rowley and Associates, the solicitors for the mother.  That letter
refers to an earlier letter of 19 October
sent by that firm to Mr Abdullah.  A
copy of the letter of 19 October is attached to the subsequent letter and I
infer it had not
been responded to as at 30 October 1998.  The letter of 30
October, inter alia, states:
<P>

 "Our client is becoming most anxious with respect to the department's apparent
change of position and we request that you comply
with the court directions
made on 30 September 1998 in relation to the department providing written
advice as to its position.  We
advise that if the same is not received by 5 pm
on Friday, 30 October 1998, then we will be requesting the court to re-list the
matter
at the first available opportunity."
<P>

21   	It is not suggested that the Department took any action to
reply to that letter or Mr McLachlan's letter of 27 October 1998.
<P>

22   	There is no explanation as to the basis upon which the
solicitor, Ms Fairley, put to the court on 30 September that the Department's
stance was now to agree to an order in terms that the child remain with the
father until aged 18. Ms Fairley did prepare a file note
which is annexed to
her affidavit sworn on 2 June 1999.  That file note records:
<P>

"Department to file doc setting out current position and noting why change and
orders sought and list of docs proposes to rely on
14 days"
<P>

23   	On 2 November 1998 Mr McLachlan wrote to the Registrar of
the Campsie Children's Court noting that no documents had been served
on him by
the plaintiff and requesting that the matter be re-listed for further
directions.  In that letter Mr McLachlan stated,
<P>

"The father, of course, cannot complete his material until such time as he has
received the department's documentation. On 1 October
and subsequently on 27
October letters were sent by this office to the Marrickville CSC in regard to
that court direction.  To date
no documents have been served."
<P>

24   	A copy of that letter was sent to the plaintiff.
<P>

25   	Mr Abdullah returned from leave on 15 October 1998.  Such
reports containing recommendations as to the custody of the child
Michael
Houdek as were contained on the Department's file consistently sought orders in
terms that the child be placed in the custody
of the father for a 12 month
period.  Neither Ms Spiliotopoulos nor Mr Abdullah were aware that the
Department had at any time changed
its position in this regard. It appears that
no transcript of the proceedings before the court on 30 September was taken
out.  As
I have already indicated, no evidence has been led to explain the
basis upon which Ms Fairley made the submissions that she did to
the court on
30 September.
<P>

26   	Following receipt of the letter of 2 November prepared by
Mr McLachlan, it appears that Mr Abdullah took some action.  The
following day
he made contact with an administrative officer with the Campsie Children's
Court.  He was not aware that the court
had set any deadlines for the filing of
documents by the Department.  The administrative officer faxed him a copy of
documents setting
out the orders that the court made on 30 September.
<P>

27   	The following day Mr Abdullah met with Mr Malos, the
Department's legal officer, and showed him a copy of Mr McLachlan's letter
of 2
November.  The two of them then reviewed the Department's file relating to the
child Michael Houdek.  They saw no evidence by
reference to the file of any
change in the Department's position.  Accordingly, neither Mr Abdullah nor Mr
Malos considered it was
necessary to take any action with respect to the order
that "the department file documents setting out current position and noting
why
change and orders sought."  I quote there from the document which is annexed to
the affidavit of Mr Abdullah, being the copy
of the orders which he received on
or about 3 November 1998.
<P>

28   	Mr Malos in his affidavit states:
<P>

"I was not concerned about the matter being re-listed because as far as I was
concerned, except for the failure to file a list of
documents, the department
had complied with the directions made on 30 September 1998.  My understanding
of the effect of the direction
made on 30 September 1998 was that the
department was required to file a report if and only if it had changed its
position in relation
to the final orders sought."
<P>

29   	The matter was listed before the court on 11 November
1998.  It was not dealt with on that day and it was stood over to 16
November.
On that occasion the magistrate, after hearing submissions from both Mr
McLachlan and Mr Malos, made an order that the
plaintiff pay the costs of the
first defendant in a sum which she fixed in the amount of $350.
<P>

30   	 It is common ground that there is no power in terms under
either the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Care and Protection) Act</a></b> 1987 or the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1987176/" class="autolink_findacts">Children's
Court Act</a></b> 1987 for the making of an order for costs in proceedings pursuant
to the former Act.
<P>

31   	Mr McLachlan submits that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1987176/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1987176/" class="autolink_findacts">Children's Court
Act</a></b> is in terms sufficiently broad to embrace an order for costs.  That
section provides as follows:
<P>

"The court may in respect of all matters with respect to which it has
jurisdiction make such orders, including interlocutory orders,
as it thinks
appropriate."
<P>

32   	The submission based on, in effect, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1987176/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15</a> was not to the
forefront in the way Mr McLachlan developed his submissions.  It is not
necessary for me to determine the scope of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1987176/s15.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 15</a> having regard to the view I
have formed about the matter.  
<P>

33   	The plaintiff accepts that a magistrate exercising
jurisdiction pursuant to the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Care and Protection) Act</a></b> may make
an order for costs in the exercise of the court's implied powers.  Such a
power, it is submitted, would only be found in
an exceptional case.  In this
respect the plaintiff referred me to the decision of the court in<b> Wilson v
McDougall</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2011%20NSWLR%20241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 11 NSWLR 241.</a>  It is not submitted that the later decision
of the High Court in<b> Grasby v Regina</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/45.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] HCA 45</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20168%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 168 CLR 1</a> has relevantly
altered the authority of<b> Wilson</b>, although it is noted that his Honour
Newman J in the latter case spoke of the power to make an order for costs as
falling within
the inherent jurisdiction of the Children's Court.
<P>

34   	The plaintiff submits, relying on<b> Wilson</b> and on a
decision of his Honour Hodgson CJ in EQ in<b> B v K</b> (unreported) 24
September 1998, that the power of a magistrate exercising jurisdiction in care
proceedings to make an order for costs
only arises in circumstances where the
party against whom the proposed order is to be made has engaged in misconduct.
The circumstances
of the present case, so the plaintiff submits, may be
suggestive of inefficiency on the part of its officers but do not establish
misconduct.
<P>

35   	Both<b> Wilson</b> and<b> B v K</b> were cases in which
consideration was given to the power to make an order for costs in care
proceedings where the proceedings were
themselves tainted by misconduct.  
<P>

36   	It seems to me that the failure to abide by a direction of
the court made within jurisdiction might be thought to raise different
considerations to those with which the court was concerned in both<b>
Wilson</b> and<b> B v K</b>.
<P>

37   	Mr McLachlan in his written submissions made reference to
an article written by K Mason QC, as his Honour then was, published
in  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%2057%20Australian%20Law%20Journal%20449" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983)
57 ALJ 449.</a>  The article is titled "The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court".
The learned author there referred to the court's inherent jurisdiction
to order
its own business:
<P>

"These powers extend to the imposition of sanctions involving the payment of
costs upon failure to adhere to the procedures laid
down."
<P>

38   	The decision of the court in<b> Gittins v WHC Stacey and
Son Pty Ltd</b> (1964) 82 WN <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">(Part 1)</a> NSW 157 was cited in this respect.  That
case involved a challenge to the power of the court to frame a practice note
with the consequence
of exposing parties to penalties in costs upon the failure
to comply with it.  His Honour Brereton J observed (at 158):
<P>

"In my opinion, it follows from what I have already said that if the court can
order its own business, it must be able to impose
some sanction upon failure to
adhere to the procedure laid down."
<P>

<b>Gittins</b> was concerned with the inherent powers of this Court.
<P>

39   	It would be surprising if the implied powers of a
magistrate exercising jurisdiction pursuant to the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Care and
Protection) Act</a></b> did not include the power to sanction by an order for costs
a breach of directions made to ensure the orderly conduct of the proceedings.
Mr Bourke, who appears for the plaintiff, did not seek to contend otherwise.
However, it was his submission that the power to make
an order for costs in
circumstances of non-compliance would only arise where the non-compliance was
accompanied by mala fides or
recklessness.  No authority was cited for that
limitation.  The plaintiff relied on the observations in<b> Wilson </b>and<b> B
v K</b> which, as I have noted, seem to me to raise rather different issues.
<P>

40   	Similarly, the plaintiff conceded that a magistrate
exercising jurisdiction under the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cca1987176/" class="autolink_findacts">Children's Court Act</a></b> would have power
to make an order for costs against a person who procured the issue of process
in the nature of a subpoena cast in
excessively wide terms upon a successful
application to set that subpoena aside.  In such a case, Mr Bourke submitted,
there would
be an abuse of the procedure of the court such as to found the
implied power to order costs.   
<P>

41   	In<b> Darcey v Preterm Foundation Clinic</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%202%20NSWLR%20497" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 2
NSWLR 497</a> at 503-4, his Honour Hunt J, as he then was, observed,
<P>

"There is no doubt in my mind that the magistrate was correct in awarding costs
in these circumstances, if indeed he had the jurisdiction
to do so.  The only
question is whether that inherent jurisdiction existed.  It would certainly be
surprising if it did not.  It
was accepted by Mr Darcey, again correctly in my
view, that this court would have the inherent jurisdiction to award costs in
these
circumstances."
<P>

Like <b>Wilson</b> this decision was prior to <b>Grasby</b>.
<P>

42   	In developing his submission that something more than
non-compliance with a direction made within jurisdiction needed to be
made out,
Mr Bourke submitted that the plaintiff's failure to reply to correspondence
from both Mr McLachlan and Ms Rowley was not
a relevant consideration.  The
matter which attracted the order for costs, so Mr Bourke submitted, was the
re-listing of the proceedings
which followed the application addressed to the
court dated 2 November 1998.  Thereafter, it was submitted, the plaintiff had
not
been wholly inactive.  Mr Bourke referred to the evidence that Mr Abdullah
and Mr Malos had looked through the Department's file
and seen no evidence of a
change of position and thereafter concluded, wrongly, that it was not necessary
to take any action to comply
with that portion of the order relating to filing
documents setting out the Department's current position.
<P>

43   	The magistrate took into account the plaintiff's failure
to respond to requests addressed to it in writing and what she described
as
further reminders.  In my view she was right to do so.
<P>

44   	I consider the starting point is the admitted failure of
the plaintiff to comply with the directions of the court made with
a view to
the efficient dispatch of the proceedings.  I consider the unexplained failure
to obey the directions of the court might
in an appropriate case justify the
making of an order for costs.  Not every failure would do so.
<P>

45   	In determining whether the failure is of such a quality as
to attract the sanction of a costs order, the court may look to
the conduct of
the defaulting party.  Here the plaintiff submits that the agreed failure arose
as a result of a misconception by
its officers.  That submission needs to be
evaluated in the light of the plaintiff's failure to heed the correspondence
both from
Mr McLachlan and the firm Rowley and Associates which put it on
notice that the view taken by Mr Abdullah and Mr Malos of the meaning
and
effect of her Worship's orders was not shared by the other parties to the
proceedings and was the cause of embarrassment to them.
<P>

46   	I consider that the making of the order in the
circumstances of this case was within the scope of the court's implied power
in
order to ensure compliance with directions made to promote the efficient
conduct of the litigation before it.  I detect no error
of principle in the
approach that the magistrate took. 
<P>

47   	Accordingly, I dismiss the summons.  I order the plaintiff
to pay the defendants' costs.
