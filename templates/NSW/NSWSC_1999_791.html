<b>1847/1996 - BROMLEY &amp; OTHERS v THE FORESTRY COMMISSION OF NEW SOUTH
WALES</b>
<P>

<b>1525/1997 - SWEETMAN v THE FORESTRY COMMISSION OF NEW SOUTH WALES</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

<b>The Parties and their Claims</b>
<P>

1   	These two matters were heard together with evidence in one
being evidence in the other on 19, 20, 21 and 24 May 1999.  Final
written
submissions were received on 28 June 1999.
<P>

2   	The plaintiffs in matter 1847/1996 (the Bromley
proceedings) are James Edward Bromley, Christine Mary Pollitt and Patricia
Ruth
Bromley.  The plaintiff in matter 1525/1997 (the Sweetman proceedings) is
Kenneth Irwin Sweetman.  In both the Bromley and the
Sweetman proceedings the
defendant is the Forestry Commission of New South Wales (the Commission).
<P>

3   	Mr A S Martin, of counsel, appeared for the plaintiffs in
both proceedings and Mr S Gageler, of counsel, appeared for the defendant
in
both proceedings.
<P>

4   	The proceedings involve claims for compensation and
royalties said to be payable to the plaintiffs by the defendant in respect
of
timber taken from land in respect of which the plaintiffs are lessees under
Crown leases. 
<P>

5   	Although the plaintiffs in both proceedings have been paid
some royalties they claim the defendant has;
<P>

(a) in the Bromley proceedings only, failed to pay compensation pursuant to a
special condition within the Crown Lease.(<i>the Bromley Compensation claim);
</i>and
<P>

(b) deducted costs from the royalties which were not properly deductible
because they were not costs that were incurred as prescribed
by s30E(2)(b)
&amp; (c) of the Forestry Act 1916,as amended (the Act) <i>(the Bromley and
Sweetman s30E(2) claims).</i>
<P>

<b>The Crown Leases</b>
<P>

6   	The Lease in the Bromley proceedings is Crown Lease 1919/1
of "all that Piece or parcel of Crown Land containing Four Thousand
eight
hundred and fifty-six (4,856) acres and being Portion 64 situate in the Parish
of Tomalla in the County of Hawes in the land
district of Scone  as delineated
on plan H 1610 - 1671" (the Bromley lease). 
<P>

7   	The history of the Bromley lease is as follows:
<P>

&#183;	On 15 November 1918 Crown Lands in Eastern Division, Land District of
Scone and Upper Hunter Shire within boundaries within
the Tomalla Occupation
License No. 503A identified as No 53,072, containing an area of about 800 acres
and 53,073, containing an
area of about 840 acres, were reserved from sale
generally pursuant to s29 of the Crown Lands Consolidation Act 1913.
<P>

&#183;	On 15 November 1918 pursuant to the provisions of the Crown Lands
Consolidation Act, 1913 and The Returned Soldiers Settlement
Act 1916 public
notification was gazetted that 4,680 acres in the Parish of Tomalla County of
Hawes were set apart for an original
Crown lease to be disposed of to a
returned soldier exclusively.  Such land was to be available on and after 13
January 1919.  It
was gazetted that:
<P>

<i>That part of the area which contains timber in excess of the requirements of
lessee as tenant thereof is set apart as a forest area.
 The forest areas are
shown on published litho by black shading. The land set apart is exempt from
the operations of general license
under the Forestry Regulations.</i>
<P>

The forest areas shown on the litho (exhibit C) by black shading were identical
to the areas designated reserve 53,072 and reserve
53,073 which had been
reserved from sale generally also on 15 November 1918. 
<P>

The gazette gave notice that the Crown lease was to be subject to the general
provisions of the Crown Lands Acts and Regulations
and to certain special
conditions which included:
<P>

<i>(f)	No timber shall be cut or removed from the land for the purpose of sale,
except subject to the provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a> and Regulations
thereunder at the time in force.  The lessee may, however, take from the land
leased to him such timber and other
material for building and other purposes
upon such land as may be required by him as tenant thereof, provided such land
is not comprised
within a timber reserve or State Forest.</i>
<P>

<i>(g)	A proportion of the forest area not exceeding one third shall be
absolutely exempt from the operation of any timber licences in
order to provide
a land supply for the development of the holding.</i>
<P>

<i>(h)	No operations in connection with timber or products (other than by the
lessee for his own use on the land leased or as provided
by conditional), shall
be allowed on the forest area except with the concurrence of the Department of
Lands under special licence,
to be issued by an authorised Forest Officer.
Provided that with the lessee's written consent such licence may also be issued
to
apply to timber or products on any part of the lease except in that part of
the forest area exempted for the sole use of the lessee.</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	The holder of a special licence to cut timber on the forest area or to
remove products therefrom, shall be governed by the conditions
and limitations
of the licence which will be framed by the Forestry Department to protect the
lessee's interest in the land.</i>
<P>

<i>(j)	The lessee shall be allowed compensation to the amount of one-third of
any royalty paid to the Crown on timber removed from the
forest area to cover
any damage done to his interests in the holding by licensed timber operations;
and</i>
<P>

<i>(q)	The land outside reserves 53,072 and 53,073 from sale generally,
notified this day, may be used for agriculture.</i>
<P>

&#183;	Mark Edward Stephens, a returned soldier, was granted Crown Lease 1919/1
for the period 7 February 1919 to 6 February 1964.

<P>

&#183;	On 25 April 1933 Mr Stephens made application to the District Surveyor
at East Maitland <i>to revoke forest area</i> <i>on portion of</i>  his Crown
Lease <i>as shown in double lines on accompanying sketch. </i>The accompanying
sketch identified <i>Forest Area -wished to be revoked.</i> This was the forest
area identical with Reserve 53,073. Mr Stephens suggested that if the timber
was ringbarked he could carry more
stock<i>. </i>He stated that the<i> area is
mostly very steep country and unsuitable for timber area, as timber could not
be got out without great difficulty and in
a great portion would be almost
impossible.</i> Mr Stephens suggested that a great portion of the timber was
<i>worthless.</i>
<P>

&#183;	On 8 June 1933 the East Maitland District Surveyor notified the
Secretary of the Commission of Mr Stephens' application as
follows;
<P>

<cite>Subject;</cite><i> Request by M.E. Stephens for revocation of State
Forest area within Crown Lease 19-1 Scone.</i>
<P>

<i>Crown Lease 19-1 comprises portion 64 of 4856 acres, Parish of Tomalla,
County of Hawes.</i>
<P>

<i>Applicant now asks that the Forest Area, which is identical with Reserve
53,073 from sale, notified 19 November 1918, shown by red
edge on..., be
revoked</i>
<P>

<i>Please state whether there are any objections in the interests of your
Commission to the revocation of R.53,073.</i>
<P>

&#183;	By letter of 1 August 1933 the Secretary of the Commission notified the
East Maitland District Surveyor as follows;
<P>

<i>I am directed to inform you that there are no objections in the interests of
forestry to the revocation of the Forest Area which is
identical with R. 53,073
from sale notified 19th November 1918, within portion 64, Parish Tomalla,
County Hawes.</i>
<P>

&#183;	In early September 1933 Mr Stephens was advised by the District
Surveyor's office that <i>the Forestry Commission report no objections to the
revocation of the Forest Area within your Crown Lease 19-1 </i>and that
<i>steps are now being taken to, have the necessary revocation gazetted </i>and
that upon such gazettal it would be open to Mr Stephens to carry out any
necessary ringbarking <i>subject to the usual permit being obtained from the
Forestry Commission.</i>
<P>

&#183;	On 11 September 1933 the District Surveyor referred the <i>Request</i>
to the Under Secretary for Lands for approval which referral included the
following:
<P>

<i>The holder, M.E. Stephens, asks that the forest area (which is identical
with Reserve 53,073 from sale notified on 15th November 1918)
be
revoked.</i>
<P>

<i>The Forestry Commission report no objection in the interests of forestry to
the revocation of R.53,073.</i>
<P>

<i>It is submitted that necessary action be now taken to revoke the whole of
Reserve 53,073.</i>
<P>

<i>&#183;	</i>On 18 September 1933 the Under Secretary for Lands approved the
<i>Request.</i>
<P>

&#183;	On 22 September 1933  <i>Revocation of Reserves from Sale, Lease etc.
</i> were gazetted as follows:
<P>

<i>It is hereby notified that under the provisions of section 30 of the Crown
Lands Consolidation Act 1913, the reserves from sale, lease
etc., hereunder
described, are hereby revoked.</i>
<P>

<i>Land District Scone;  Reserve No 53,073;  Purpose From sale generally; Date
of Notification 15 Nov.,1918;  Parish Tomalla;  County
Hawes;  Shire etc. Upper
Hunter;  Area 840 acres;  Part Revoked The whole H. 1610-16671R. Papers No. P
33-7.776.</i>
<P>

&#183;	On 23 April 1934 Mr Stephens applied to have the term of his lease
extended to a lease in perpetuity.  
<P>

&#183;	On 22 November 1934 the East Maitland District Surveyor referred Mr
Stephens' application for extension to the Under Secretary
for Lands for
Approval noting the following:
<P>

<i>Subject holding, comprising portion 64,containing 4856 acres, ex M T 1 and G
Ls 1 to 5.</i>
<P>

<i>It is within Sandon Gold Field, Notified 31st July 1907; and partly within
R. 53,072, Notified 15th November,1918.</i>
<P>

<i>The Forestry Commission ..report no objections to the application nor do
they oppose revocation of R 53,072.</i>
<P>

<i>..the application is submitted for approval, subject to....revocation of
R.53.072 from Sale generally.</i>
<P>

&#183;	On 11 January 1935 <i>Revocation of Reserves from Sale, Lease etc.
</i>were gazetted as follows:
<P>

<i>It is hereby notified that under the provisions of section 30 of the Crown
Lands Consolidation Act 1913, the reserves from sale, lease

<P>

<i>Land District Scone;  Reserve No. 53,072;  Purpose From sale generally;

<P>

&#183;	On 1 February 1935 <i>Extension of Term of Crown Leases </i>was gazetted
as follows:
<P>

<i>It is hereby notified that the term of the under mentioned Crown leases has
been extended to a lease in perpetuity.</i>
<P>

<i>Land District Scone Shire Woolooma</i>
<P>

<i>Parish Tomalla; County Hawes; Crown Lease 1919-1; portion 64; 4,856 acres;
holder Mark Edward Stephens; L 34-22,216</i>
<P>

&#183;	On 14 September 1973 a Proclamation made by the Governor on 25 July 1973
was gazetted as follows:
<P>

<i>"I, Sir Arthur Roden Cutler, Governor of the State of New South Wales and
its Dependencies, in the Commonwealth of Australia, in pursuance
of the
provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a> and with the advice of the Executive
Council, do, by this my Proclamation, declare that the land described in the
Schedule hereto
is dedicated as a State Forest.</i>
<P>

<i>Schedule</i>
<P>

    <i> Eastern Division</i>
<P>

<i>       Land District of Scone; Scone Shire;</i>
<P>

            <i> Newcastle Forestry District</i>
<P>

<i>Barrington Tops State Forest No 977,No 3 Extension. An area of about 966.72
hectares in the Parish of Tomalla, County of Hawes, being
portion 64 delineated
in plan catalogued H 1610 -1671R in the Department of Lands Inclusive of the
non-public reserved road,20.115
metres wide, traversing the portion, and
portions MT 1, Gl 1, Gl 2, Gl 3, Gl 4 and GL 5 but exclusive of the public
reserved road,
20.115 metres wide, traversing the portion.</i>
<P>

&#183;	On 7 May 1976 Crown Lease 1991/1 was transferred by way of sale to the
plaintiffs.  
<P>

8   	Since 1 October 1986 Mr Sweetman has been and remains the
holder of and lessee of Crown leases 1915/4 and 1915/5 which are
leases in
perpetuity. The leased land is described as Lots 73 and 74 in Deposited Plan
753715 in the Parish of Tomalla in the County
of Hawes Shire of Scone
delineated on Crown Plans  1482.1671 and 1483.1671 respectively (the Sweetman
leases). The Sweetman leases
are adjacent to the Bromley lease.
<P>

<b>The Bromley Compensation Claim</b>
<P>

9   	The plaintiffs claim that since January 1986 timber has
been removed from the forest areas within the Bromley lease by licensed
timber
operations. It is claimed that the defendant has been paid royalties in respect
of the timber removed from those forest areas
and that Special Condition (n) of
the Bromley lease requires the defendant to pay compensation to the plaintiffs
to the amount of
one-third of those royalties.
<P>

10   	The Crown Lease witnessed by the Governor on the 28th
August 1940 (Ex.A) contains special condition (n) which provides that:
<P>

<i>(n) The Lessee shall be allowed compensation to the amount of one-third of
any royalty paid to the Crown on timber removed from the
forest area, to cover
any damage done to his interest in the holding by licensed timber
operations.</i>
<P>

11   	Mr Martin submitted that the forest areas in the Bromley
lease were co-extensive with Reserves 53,072 and 53,073 which were
reserved
from sale generally pursuant to s29 of the Crown Lands Consolidation Act
1913<i>. </i>He submitted that although the reservations from sale generally
had been revoked on 1 February 1935 and 22 September 1933 respectively
there
was no revocation of the forest areas. 
<P>

12   	He submitted special condition (n) remains unaffected by
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a> and that compensation was therefore payable to the
plaintiffs.<i> </i>A central plank to this claim was Mr Martin's submission
that the provisions of the Act and Regulations which preceded the present
s30E
were concerned with the grant of timber licences and did not expressly purport
to vary or affect the terms of Crown leases.
<P>

13   	The Forestry Commission denies the Bromley plaintiffs are
entitled to any compensation under special condition (n) of the
Bromley lease.
Mr Gageler submitted that there are three reasons why the claim based on
special condition (n) must fail;
<P>

(1)	Special condition (n) only applies to timber removed from a forest area and
such an area has not existed within the Bromley
lease at any relevant time
(Forest Areas).
<P>

(2)	The right conferred by special condition (n) has been abrogated by Division
3 (Payment of royalty) of Part 3 (Provisions relating
to the taking of timber,
products and forest materials)of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a> which it is submitted is
an exhaustive code in relation to payment of royalties which is inconsistent
with any contractual entitlement
to royalties. (Abrogation/Exhaustive Code);
and
<P>

(3)	Special condition (n) only confers a right to recompense for loss up to one
third of any royalty paid to the Crown and the plaintiffs
have not shown they
suffered any damage (Loss &amp; Damage).
<P>

<b>Forest Areas</b>
<P>

14   	Mr Gageler submitted  that the <i>forest areas</i> are the
areas of the Lease reserved from sale under s29 of the Crown Lands
Consolidation Act 1913. He relied on the legend in the
published litho which
states <i>Forest Areas (reserved from sale generally) barred against
conversion. </i>He submitted that the proper construction of the Lease is that
the forest areas are the reserved areas 53,072 and 53,073; the two
are not
simply matters of geographical co-incidence and once the reservations from sale
generally were revoked the forest areas no
longer existed. 
<P>

15   	The assessment of this submission against Mr Martin's
submission that the <i>forest areas </i>survived the revocation of the
reservations of 53,072 and 53,073 from sale generally requires an analysis of
the legislative structure
within which the reservations and revocations
occurred.
<P>

16   	During the period 1918 to 1935 when these reservations and
revocations occurred the Minister administering the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a> was
required to cause a classification of the forest lands of the State for the
purpose of determining which of such lands were suitable
to be permanently
dedicated as State forests or <i>temporarily reserved from sale as timber
reserves</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s17).</a>
<P>

17   	Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s22</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a> the Governor, on the
recommendation of the Minister and with the concurrence of the Secretary for
Lands, could by notice in the Gazette
temporarily reserve from sale any Crown
land as a timber reserve or revoke or alter, in whole or in part, any such
reservation of
land for a timber or forest reserve.
<P>

18   	There was no definition of <i>forest reserve</i> but
<i>timber reserve </i>was defined as land temporarily reserved for forestry
purposes <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s4).</a>  No reservation from sale of land as a timber or forest reserve
could be revoked or altered except under the Act (s23).
<P>

19   	The Governor could also dedicate certain land as a State
forest and such dedication could not be revoked except under the
Act (s23).
<i>State forest </i>was defined as land dedicated under the Act as a State
forest (s4).
<P>

20   	During the same period, in particular on 15 November 1918,
the Minister for Lands also had power under s85(2) of the Crown
Lands
Consolidation Act 1913 to subject any lands set apart under that section to
<i>reservations of timber scrub or undergrowth and to such other reservations
and restrictions as to the Minister may seem necessary
in the public interest
and be specified in the notification.</i>  There was a definition of scrub (s5)
but there was no definition of timber or undergrowth.  The Minister had the
power to alter
the notification under s86 of the Crown Lands Consolidation Act
1913 but not, it seems, so as to affect the reservation made under
s85(2) of
the Act.<i> </i>
<P>

21   	The reservations of 53,072 and 53,073 from sale generally
as gazetted on 15 November 1918 were pursuant to s29 of the Crown
Lands
Consolidation Act 1913. The relevant section at the time provided:
<P>

<i>The Minister may by notification in the gazette reserve any Crown lands
therein described from being sold or let upon lease or license
in such
particular manner as may be specified in such notification; and the lands shall
thereupon be temporarily reserved from sale
or lease or licence accordingly,
and, unless the contrary is expressly declared, shall not be reserved from sale
or lease generally.</i>
<P>

22   	The setting apart of the land for the Crown Lease was also
gazetted on 15 November 1918. Although gazetted as pursuant to
the Crown Land
Consolidation Act 1913 and the Returned Soldiers Settlement Act 1916 there was
no reference to the specific sections
in these Acts pursuant to which the
Minister acted. I am of the view that the notification was pursuant to s85 of
the former Act
and s3 of the latter Act.
<P>

23   	Under s85(1) the Minister had the power to set apart land
for holdings, including lease holdings, of the kinds specified in
the
notification in the Gazette. S85(2) provided:
<P>

<i>(2) The areas of land set apart by the Minister may be limited to the
surface only of such land or to the surface and to such depth
below the surface
as may be specified in the notification, <b>and such areas shall also be
subject to any reservations of timber scrub or undergrowth and to such other
reservations and restrictions
as to the Minister may seem necessary in the
public interest and be specified in the notification.</b></i>
<P>

24   	Section 85(4) of that Act provided: 
<P>

<i>(4) Notwithstanding anything in this Act, or the Mining Act,1906, or the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a> the setting apart of any land  for original or conditional
purchase conditional lease homestead selection settlement lease conditional
purchase lease homestead farm suburban holding or Crown-lease shall have the
effect of revoking any reserves, or parts of reserves,
or population areas
within the boundaries of the lands so set apart, unless the contrary is
expressly declared by the terms of the
notification. Such revocation shall take
immediate effect on the expiration of the day next preceding the day upon which
the land
becomes available in pursuance of the notification; Provided that the
revocation of any reserve for mining or mining purposes or
any timber reserve
shall not be so effected unless in the case of a reserve for mining purposes
the consent thereto of the Secretary
of Mines or in the case of a timber
reserve of the Minister administering the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act</a> has been
obtained.</i>
<P>

<i>Such setting apart as aforesaid shall also have the effect of revoking any
previous setting apart of the same land unless the contrary
is expressly
declared by the terms of the notification.</i>
<P>

25   	The notification in the gazette on 15 November 1918
setting the land apart contained a Note to the description of the land
which
read as follows;
<P>

<i>Note.-Includes part (about 1,700 acres) of classification reserve, notified
19th October 1910, parts (about 1,150 acres) of reserve
35,186 from conditional
sale, and part (about 1,830 acres) of reserve 39,646 from sale for mining,
which parts are hereby revoked.
The above is exclusive of mining portions gold
leases 1 to 5 inclusive, and mining tenement 1. The area capital value, annual
rent,
and survey fee are subject to adjustment after survey. <b>Reserves Nos
53,072 and 53,073 from sale generally, are not affected by this
notification.</b></i>
<P>

If I am right in the view that the setting apart of the land for the Crown
Lease on 15 November 1918 was pursuant to s85 of the
Crown Lands Consolidation
Act 1913 reserves 53,072 and 53,073 from sale generally were therefore not
revoked by force of s85(4) because
the contrary was expressly declared by the
terms of the notification.
<P>

26   	I am of the view that this Note militates against any
suggestion that the forest areas merged with the Reserves. Had it been
intended
that the forest areas were to be the Reserves a statement to such effect could
have been made in the Notification. What
was said was something quite
different. The forest areas were referred to as the shaded areas on the Litho
rather than by specific
reference to Reserves 53,072 and 53,073 and these
Reserves were not affected by the notification.
<P>

27   	There is no evidence before me by way of gazettal that
suggests that the Governor reserved the land in 53,072 and/or 53,073
as timber
or forest reserves under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a>.
<P>

28   	What is clear is that reservations from sale generally of
53,072 and 53,073 were pursuant to s 29 of the Crown Lands Consolidation
Act
1913.  It is also clear that the revocations of these reserves in 1933 and 1935
were made pursuant to s30 of that Act. S30 provided
that:  
<P>

<i>Timber or forest reserves or reserves revocable under section one hundred
and six of the Mining Act, 1906, shall not be subject to
revocation or
modification under this section.</i>
<P>

29   	There was no definition of <i>timber reserve</i> or
<i>forest reserve</i> in the Crown Lands Consolidation Act 1913. 
<P>

30   	I am of the view that the gazettal of 15 November 1918 in
particular that portion in which the Minister <i>set apart as a forest area
</i>certain part of the land was a <i>reservation </i>of the forest area (a
forest reserve) pursuant to s85(2) of the Crown Lands Consolidation Act
1913.
<P>

31   	I disagree with Mr Gageler's submission that the forest
areas had no independent existence from the reservations 53,072 and
53,073 from
sale generally.  Reservations 53,072 &amp; 53,073 on the one hand and the
forest areas on the other hand were reserved
separately and respectively under
s29 and s85 of the Crown Lands Consolidation Act 1913. The reserves 53,072 and
53,073 endured the
reservation of the same land as forest areas under s85(2) by
reason of the express intention in the notification in the Gazette.
<P>

32   	In reaching the conclusion that although these
reservations were of identical areas they were separate from each other, I
have
had regard to s31 of the Crown Lands Consolidation Act 1913 which provided:
<P>

<i>31. No dedication or reservation shall be held to be invalid by reason of
the land being already reserved at the date of such dedication
or reservation,
or by reason of the revocation of any other reservation including wholly or in
part the same land.</i>
<P>

33   	The terms of the notification of 15 November 1918 do not
include the words <i>temporarily reserved from sale as a timber reserve </i>as
used in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a>. The published litho (Ex. C) does not use those
words either. It uses the words <i>Forest Areas (Reserved from Sale generally)
barred against conversion. </i>I am of the view that this is a reference to a
special condition of the Lease at the time which provided that:
<P>

<i>(p) The right of conversion into any other form of tenure of the areas
within reserves 53,072 and 53,073 from sale generally, notified
this day, as
provided for in sections 135 and 184 of the Crown Lands Consolidation Act,
1913, is hereby barred.</i>
<P>

It does not seem to me that the words in the Litho could have the effect of
merging the two quite separate reservations, one under
s29 in which the words
<i>reserved from sale generally </i>are used and the other under s85(2) in
which the words <i>areas..subject to any reservation of timber </i>are used.
<P>

34   	Neither party has submitted that the use of the words
<i>set apart </i>in the notification of 15 November 1918 in relation to the
forest area have any specific significance. The Minister had the power
to set
apart land for holdings pursuant to s85(1) and such land as set apart by the
Minister could be limited and/or subjected to
restrictions and/or reservations
under s85(2). I am of the view that the notification subjected the portion of
the land shown on
the published litho by black<i> shading</i> to a reservation
of forest or timber area.
<P>

35   	As the forest area was not a <i>reservation from sale
</i>of a timber reserve under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a> I am of the view that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s23</a>
of that Act would not apply for the purpose of any revocation of the areas.  I
am also of the view that the reference to timber and
forest reserves in s30 of
the Crown Lands Consolidation Act 1913 includes a reference to such reservation
pursuant to s85(2) of that
Act. I am therefore of the view that the forest
areas could not have been revoked under the s30 notifications in 1933 and
1935.
<P>

36   	There has been no submission by either party as to the
affect, if any, of the Governor's Proclamation on 25 July 1973 gazetted
on 14
September 1973 in which it appears that the land in the Bromley Lease was
dedicated as a State Forest under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a>. I say `appears'
because it is not clear from the evidence whether the whole of the leased land
is included in such dedication. 
<P>

37   	I have presumed there has been no such submission because
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s25</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a> provides that such dedication does not affect any
lease or license from the Crown current and in force at the time of such
dedication.
There is also no express provision in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a> that
such a dedication would revoke the reservation made under s85(2) of the Crown
Lands Consolidation Act 1913. However if I am
wrong in relation to this aspect
of the matter it may be of little consequence because of my findings in
relation to Mr Gageler's
second submission as to why the plaintiffs' claim must
fail.
<P>

38   	I conclude that the forest area referred to in the
notification gazetted on 15 November 1918 was not revoked by the revocation
of
the reserves 53,072 and 53,073 from sale generally.
<P>

<b>Exhaustive Code/Abrogation</b>
<P>

39   	Mr Gageler submitted that if there is a contractual right
to compensation that survived the 1930's it has been abrogated by
Division 3 of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Part 3</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a>.  He acknowledged that there was no express
abrogation but submitted that it had occurred by necessary implication.
<P>

40   	He submitted that there is no way of reading Division 3 of
the Act other than by way of providing an exhaustive code for the
payments of
royalties to the lessee and further submitted that it would be absurd for the
lessee to have an entitlement to some part
of one third of a royalty payable
under the Act and some further contractual right to some other share of the
royalty.
<P>

41   	Mr Martin submitted that there has been no abrogation of
the plaintiffs' contractual entitlement because the provisions of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry
Act</a> and Regulations which preceded <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s30e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s30E</a> did not purport to vary or affect the
terms of Crown leases either expressly or by necessary implication.
<P>

42   	A decision on this aspect of the matter requires a review
of the legislative history in relation to the payment of royalties
pursuant to
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a> and the Regulations made thereunder. 
<P>

43   	The system whereby compensation could be claimed by
lessees of Crown Lands in relation to timber within a Crown lease was
first
introduced by the Ringbarking on Crown Lands Regulation Act 1881. The lessee
was only entitled to make a claim for compensation
in respect of ringbarking of
trees on the leased land if it was covered by a permission granted by the
Minister and it had increased
the value of the land to any purchaser.  Such
compensation was limited to one shilling and threepence per acre (s4).
<P>

44   	The system for royalty payments to the Crown for timber
felled on Crown Lands contained in the Crown Lands Act<b> </b>1884 required
persons licensed to fell timber on Crown Lands and Timber Reserves to pay
royalty calculated according to the class
of timber felled and/or according to
a scale fixed by Regulation.  That Act also required the licensee to pay to the
Crown what was
described as "upset rent" (s115).
<P>

45   	The first <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act</a><b> </b> of 1909 provided that the
licences of timber getters and other licensees would be subject to the payment
of royalty to the Crown
(s16(a);  s<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s17.html" class="autolink_findacts">17</a>(3)).  The calculation of the royalty at
that time was on the log measurement of the timber or as prescribed by the
director of Forests.
 Royalty was to be paid both on timber felled and on
products taken from the lands under the Act (s18 &amp; 19).
<P>

46   	In the 1916 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act</a> which repealed the 1909 Act s30
provided for the payment of royalties to the Crown for timber and products
taken in pursuance of
licences issued under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act</a><b>.  </b>That
royalty was to be fixed by the Forestry Commission but was not to be less than
such minimums, if any, as were prescribed by the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s30.html" class="autolink_findacts">Regulations (s30).</a>
<P>

47   	The Regulations to the 1916 Act provided for an
apportionment of royalty to be payable to a Crown lessee.  That payment was
a
requirement imposed by a special condition included in special licences under
Regulation 46.  The special condition required payment
by the licensee to the
Crown of two-thirds and to the lessee of one-third of the amount of any royalty
imposed.  That Regulation
came into force in June 1917.
<P>

48   	Regulation 46 was amended in 1920 to include the following
proviso:
<P>

<i>The payment to the Crown of two-thirds and to the lessee of one-third of the
amount of any royalty charged; <b> provided that no payment of part of royalty
charged shall be made to the lessee in respect of timber obtained from any such
lease
or part of such lease situated within a State Forest or Timber
Reserve.</b></i>
<P>

49   	The Regulation in that form remained unaltered until 1957
when it was amended to provide that the Crown was to be paid 95%
and the lessee
5% of the royalties paid to the Crown by the licensees.  The terms of the
proviso were not amended.  
<P>

50   	In 1972 the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a> was amended and a system was
introduced whereby the Crown lessee became entitled to one-third of royalties
paid after the deduction
of a prescribed amount. At this time the Regulations
were also amended and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">Regulation 46</a> was omitted.  This system remained in place
until 1984 when the Act was further amended.
<P>

51   	In 1984 that part of the Act entitling the lessee to a
payment of one-third of the royalty after the deduction of the prescribed
amount was repealed.  The amending Act set up a compensation fund (s30C) into
which was to be paid such part of royalties collected
which the Commission
determined should be set aside for payment of compensation to Crown lessees.

<P>

52   	This scheme was set up under a new Division 5 which
provided that where timber or products had been removed from the land
by timber
operators the Commission was to make an assessment of the amount of
compensation, if any, payable in respect of "disturbance
to the land occasioned
by the taking of timber, products or forest materials" (s30K).  Under these
provisions the Commission was
required to take certain matters into account
when assessing the compensation to which the Crown lessee was entitled
(s30L).
<P>

53   	Although royalty was still paid to the Crown the lessee
had no statutory entitlement to share in that royalty albeit that
the source of
the funds for the compensation fund was the royalties.  The lessee only had an
entitlement to have an assessment of
compensation made for disturbance to the
land in his lease holding.
<P>

54   	In 1989 the system of apportionment of royalty was
re-introduced into the legislation. Section 30E came into force and the
former
compensation provisions were phased out over a twelve month period (s30K).
Section 30L prohibited the payment of compensation
and an apportionment of
royalty during the same period.
<P>

55   	In support of his submission that the legislation had, by
necessary implication, abrogated the plaintiffs' contractual entitlement
in
special condition (n) Mr Gageler relied upon <b>Wik Peoples v Queensland</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20187%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 187 CLR 1.</a>  In particular he referred to the following portion of Kirby
J's judgment at p 248-249: 
<P>

<i>Existing proprietary rights might be affected by Parliament by acting
within, and in accordance with, its constitutional power.  However,
to deprive
a person of pre-existing proprietary interests, the legislation enacted by
Parliament must clearly do so, either by express
enactment or by necessary
implication.</i>
<P>

56   	A legislative intention that persons are to be
dispossessed of valuable property rights or contractual rights in respect of
such property should not be implied unless expressed in unequivocal terms
incapable of any other meaning. If the statute is capable
of being interpreted
without supposing that it is interfering with such rights it should be so
interpreted. <b>The Commonwealth v Hazeldell </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1918/75.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1918] HCA 75</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281918%29%2025%20CLR%20552" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1918) 25 CLR 552</a> at 563;
<b>Melbourne Corporation v Barry </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1922/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1922] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281922%29%2031%20CLR%20174" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1922) 31 CLR 174</a> at 206.
<P>

57   	I am not satisfied that the legislative and regulatory
history of the particular apportionment of royalties between the Crown
and its
lessees viewed in isolation can assist me in the search for the alleged
necessary implication.  The fluctuation in the Crown
lessees share of the
royalties during this long history from one-third (1917-1957) to 5% (1957-1972)
to one-third (1972-1984) to
nil (1984-1989) and back to one-third (1989 to
date) may be more indicative of political vagaries than of any discernible
integrity
of policy in respect of the relationship between the Crown and its
lessees. However the history of the development of the structure
of the schemes
requires a closer analysis.
<P>

58   	Although not specifically addressed in argument before me,
it may be argued that the original lessee was disentitled to the
compensation
under special condition (n) during the period 1920 to 1972 when the prohibition
was in place pursuant to regulation
46 preventing any payment of "part of
royalty charged..in respect of timber or products obtained" from the lease or
any part of the
lease situated in a State Forest or Timber Reserve.
Alternatively it may be argued that the prohibition was in place to prevent a
double payment of royalty and compensation in respect of the same land.
<P>

59   	I am of the view that the reference in special condition
(n) to "the amount of one-third of any royalty" was to fix the maximum
compensation that could be paid to a lessee.  It was not a payment of royalty.
It was a payment of compensation that had been capped
at an amount equivalent
to one-third of any royalty paid to the Crown in respect of timber removed from
the forest area.  This amount
remained capped at one-third even when the
apportionment under Regulation 46 was set at 95% to the Crown and 5% to the
lessee between
1957 and 1972. 
<P>

60   	The lessee was not receiving a payment "in respect of
timber or products" pursuant to special condition (n).  What the lessee
was
entitled to receive was a payment "to cover any damage done to his interest in
the holding by licensed timber operations". The
two concepts are quite
different. If this were not so it is to be expected that during the period 1957
to 1972 the capping of the
compensation would have been reduced to 5% of any
royalty paid. This was not done.
<P>

61   	Royalty payments to Crown lessees have been at the sole
discretion of the Crown. The maintenance of the Crown land under Crown
leases
has contributed to the capacity of the Crown to earn income from licensees in
the form of a royalty payment. Those licensees
have paid the royalty for the
privilege or right under their licences to take the timber or products from the
land the subject of
the Crown leases. <b>Stanton v FCT </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1955/56.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1955] HCA 56</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281955%29%2092%20CLR%20630" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1955) 92 CLR 630.</a>
The Crown lessees shared in that income to whatever extent the Crown, in its
sole discretion, decided from time to time.
<P>

62   	Compensation is a payment of a different kind. It is for
recompense for a loss suffered. In the context of real property it
provides a
replacement in monetary value of property or rights which have been lost or
damaged (s126(1) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rpa1900178/" class="autolink_findacts">Real Property Act 1900</a> (NSW)).
<P>

63   	I see no necessary implication that the contractual
entitlement under special condition (n) was lost during the period up
to 1972
nor am I satisfied that the necessary implication of this prohibition was to
equate a share of royalty with an entitlement
to compensation and thus prevent
a double payment.
<P>

64   	There was no such prohibition during the period 1972 to
1984.  The plaintiffs were therefore entitled to the share of the
one-third of
the royalty after the deduction of the prescribed amount in respect of timber
and products taken from the land.  I am
satisfied that the plaintiffs'
contractual entitlement to compensation pursuant to special condition (n) could
sit quite comfortably
with the statutory provisions in respect of the
apportionment of royalties during this period. One was an unconditional
statutory
entitlement to a share of the Crown's royalty income, the other was
compensation "to cover damage".
<P>

65   	The present statutory provisions for the apportionment of
royalties are similar to the provisions between 1972 and 1984 except
the
"prescribed amount" to be deducted under the former scheme has been replaced by
particular reference to the deduction of certain
"cost incurred".  The more
complex feature of discerning any necessary implication from the introduction
of the present system of
apportionment is what happened between 1984 and 1989
when the compensation system was introduced and subsequently phased out.
<P>

66   	The statutory compensation was for "disturbance to the
land occasioned by the taking of timber products on and from the land"
(s30K(1)&amp;(2)). The assessment of compensation for the "disturbance"
required consideration of the effects of the operations carried
out on the land
for the taking of the timber and products and the construction of roads,
bridges, gates and ramps and any incidental
works associated with the
operations. The consideration of the effects of this construction was
irrespective of whether such construction
was on the land (s30K(3)).
<P>

67   	In making the assessment of whether any compensation
should be paid the Commission was required to consider "both beneficial
and
detrimental" effects on the land of these operations and/or construction
(s30K(3)).
<P>

68   	Special condition (n) entitled the lessee to compensation
for "damage done to his interest in the holding by licensed timber
operations".
It did not accommodate a process of reducing or eliminating the compensation
payable by taking into account the fact
that a bridge was constructed some
miles from the land which may have improved the licensees access to the land.

<P>

69   	The statutory compensation scheme did accommodate such a
process.  It effectively allowed the Commission to recoup its costs
of
construction and incidental works associated with the timber, products and
forest materials operations by determining that such
were beneficial effects on
the leased land, setting them off against any detrimental effects and thereby
eliminating any liability
to pay compensation to the lessee.  It could then
keep the whole of the royalties paid to it by the licensees.  Alternatively it
could reduce the amount of royalty payable to the lessee by such a process.
<P>

70   	The lessees were able to object to the assessment made by
the Commission and, if agreement could not be reached, the matter
was then
referred to the Valuer-General who would review that assessment and make a new
assessment. The Valuer-General was also required
to take the same matters into
consideration that the Commission was required to consider in its assessment
(s30L).
<P>

71   	In 1989 when the statutory provisions constituting the
compensation scheme were repealed they were replaced by the present
s30E which
provides;
<P>

<b><i>30E Apportionment of Royalty-Certain Land</i></b>
<P>

<i>(1)	This section applies to a royalty payable in respect of timber, products
or forest materials taken on or from prescribed land.</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	When a royalty to which this section applies is paid to the commission
the commission is required to pay to the landholder concerned
one-third of the
balance of the royalty remaining after deduction of the following
amounts:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	any part of the royalty that is payable pursuant to a determination
under s30D (payments to certain organisations),</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	any costs incurred by the commission in connection with the
establishment, planting, maintenance, improvement and protection of
the timber,
products or forest materials,</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	any costs incurred by the commission in connection with the facilitation
of the taking of the timber, products or forest materials,
including the costs
of construction and maintenance of roads, bridges, gates, ramps and incidental
works,</i>
<P>

<i>(3)	The costs that are deductable under subs (2)(b) and (c) are to be as
determined by the commission.</i>
<P>

<i>(4) 	A share of royalty payable by the commission to a landholder under this
section must be paid before the expiration of one month
after the end of the
financial year of the commission that is current when the royalty concerned is
paid to the commission.</i>
<P>

<i>(5)	Nothing is this Division entitles a landholder to be paid an amount of
royalty in respect of the taking of timber, products, or
forest materials under
a licence held by a the landholder.</i>
<P>

72   	This section gives recognition to those costs which under
the compensation scheme were referable to the "effects (both beneficial
and
detrimental) on the land". The Commission is not required to determine these
costs with reference to any beneficial or detrimental
effect to the  lessees'
land.
<P>

73   	I have been referred to the Second Reading Speech in the
Legislative Assembly on 25 July 1989 in relation to these amendments
which in
part refers to this aspect of the matter.  The Honourable Member for Clarence,
Mr Causley the then Minister for Natural
Resources, said at p 8470;
<P>

<i>The legislation contemplates that the Forestry Commission will be able to
carry out essential silvicultural work, fire control activities
and the
construction and maintenance of roads and bridges in the knowledge that the
costs of such activities and the associated administrative
costs will be fully
recoverable upon the harvest of the timber to which they relate.  This will
promote the orderly supply of valuable
timber resources to industry and, at the
same time, <b>provide adequate recompense for the affected landholder.
</b>(emphasis added)</i>
<P>

and later at p 8471:
<P>

<b><i>The legislation will serve to properly compensate landholders of certain
Crown timber lands in respect of harvesting activities on
their land by
reference to a formula which is certain. Thus it will avoid the complexities
with assessment of compensation and the
consequent potential for appeals to the
Valuer General.</i></b>
<P>

74   	Thus the royalty was given a purpose - that of <b>proper
</b>compensation of the lessee for the harvesting activities on the land.  For
the first time royalty was equated with compensation. The
legislation
recognised that equation with s30L preventing the payment of compensation and
royalty during the same period.
<P>

75   	It is important to keep in mind that I am not assessing
the fairness of the legislative scheme. At this stage I am only dealing
with
the interpretation of it to discover whether the contractual entitlement to
compensation has been lost. The fact that the legislative
scheme may deliver an
amount less than that which would be payable under the contractual entitlement
may be said to be relevant to
the decision as to whether the abrogation is
necessarily implied.  Even if I were to accept such a proposition caution would
have
to be exercised in relation to it because there is no rule that requires
the legislature to act fairly.
<P>

76   	I am of the view that one of the purposes of the royalty
apportionment scheme enacted to replace the compensation scheme is
to
compensate the lessee for damage done to his interests in the holding by timber
operations.  Mr Martin submitted that the compensation
in special condition (n)
is directed to a matter different from the timber operations of licensees who
are required to pay royalty.
He submitted that it is simply directed to timber
removed from forest areas.  This submission cannot be sustained in the light of
the wording of the special condition which specifically refers to damage done
by "licensed timber operations".
<P>

77   	The legislative scheme for the payment of royalty is for
the same compensation as that for which special condition (n) provides.
In
those circumstances I am of the view that the amendments have the necessary
implication that an additional right to compensation
for the very same damage
could not endure whilst this legislation is in place. 
<P>

78   	I am of the view that the contractual entitlement to
compensation under special condition (n) has been abrogated by necessary
implication of the 1989 amendments to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a>.
<P>

<b>Loss or Damage</b>
<P>

79   	Mr Gageler submits that the terms of special condition (n)
of the Bromley Lease do not give the plaintiffs an entitlement
to one third of
royalty paid to the Crown. He emphasises the reference to compensation for
damage in the clause and submits that
it provides an entitlement to recompense
for loss (<b>Nelungaloo Pty Ltd v Commonwealth</b><i> </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1947/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1947] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281948%29%2075%20CLR%20495" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1948) 75 CLR 495</a> at
571)<i> </i>up to a particular capped amount if there is any damage done to the
lessee's interests. He submits that the plaintiffs have not shown
any such
damage in this case and therefore this claim must fail.
<P>

80   	Mr Martin submits that all the plaintiffs have to
establish is that timber was removed from the forest area during the relevant
period. He submits that such removal enlivens the compensatory provisions and
the plaintiffs are entitled to payment of compensation
irrespective of proof of
damage. He submits that there is no necessity to prove damage for the
declaratory relief sought and that
quantification can be dealt with at a later
time 
<P>

81   	If I am wrong in the interpretation of the legislative
implication of abrogation of the plaintiff's contractual entitlement
I am
however of the view that any declaration as to entitlement to compensation
should not be made until damage has been proved.
There has been no damage
proved in this case. 
<P>

82   	For the above reasons the plaintiffs' claims for
compensation pursuant to special condition (n) of the Crown lease in the
Bromley proceedings fails.

<P>

<b>The Legislative Scheme</b>
<P>

83   	The 1989 amendment to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a> required the
Commission to pay to the lessee one-third of the balance of the royalty it
received in respect of the lessee's land
after the deduction of certain
amounts.  Those amounts were prescribed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s30e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s30E(2)(b)</a> and (c).  They were:

<i>(b)	any costs incurred by the Commission in connection with the
establishment, planting, maintenance, improvement and protection of
the timber,
products or forest materials </i>
<P>

<i>(c)	any costs incurred by the Commission in connection with facilitation of
the taking of the timber, products or forest materials,
including the costs of
construction and maintenance of roads, bridges, gates, ramps and incidental
works.</i>

(c) were "to be as determined by the commission".	  
<P>

<b>Costs incurred</b>
<P>

85   	The plaintiffs contend that the words "costs" and
"incurred" in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s30e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s30E(2)(b)</a> &amp; (c) should be given their ordinary and natural
meaning <b>Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Limited v FCT</b><i> </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%2055%20ALJR%20434" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 55
ALJR 434</a> at 437<i>.</i>  It was submitted that the ordinary and natural meaning
of the words "costs" in the section is the actual costs.  This is said to
include all direct and indirect costs of the Commission.  
<P>

86   	The word "costs" usually carries the meaning of "an amount
paid out". The cost of an item is not determined either by taking
the present
day cost and discounting it or by applying an index to historical cost
(<b>Allsands Pty Limited v Shoalhaven City Council</b><i> </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2029%20NSWLR%20597" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 29 NSWLR
597</a> at 607<i>). </i>
<P>

87   	The plaintiffs contend that the word "incurred" in the
section means "paid or borne".  It is submitted that the costs must
have been
paid or borne by the Commission to fall within the terms of the section.   The
plaintiffs place emphasis on the fact that
the word "incurred " is used as a
verb in the past tense to qualify the word "costs".  
<P>

88   	The word "incurred" has been held to mean not only
"defrayed, discharged or borne" but includes "encountered, run into or
fallen
upon". It must be more than merely "impending, threatened or expected" (<b>New
Zealand Flax Investments Limited v FCT</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1938/60.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1938] HCA 60</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%2061%20CLR%20179" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1938) 61 CLR 179</a> at 207).
<P>

89   	The defendant submitted that the use of the word "costs"
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s30e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s30E</a> is an expression of inherent flexibility.  In support of this
submission Mr Gageler relied upon <b>Vardon v Commonwealth</b><i> </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1943/30.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1943] HCA 30</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281943%29%2067%20CLR%20434" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1943) 67
CLR 434</a> in particular in the judgment of Latham CJ at 444 wherein His Honour in
interpreting the term "cost" in the context that a maximum
price was "fixed at
the cost of those goods...plus 20% thereof" said:
<P>

<i>"...as the Commissioner has specified neither landed costs nor any other
cost, and as the term `costs' is necessarily uncertain in
meaning when applied
to goods of the description to which the notice refers, the notice is not a
notice fixing a price within the

<P>

90   	Mr Gageler also relied upon the following portion of Rich
J's judgment:
<P>

<i>" `Cost', not being defined, is an ambiguous and uncertain term. The general
idea of cost covers a number of different meanings (p.35,
Incidence of Overhead
Costs, Professor Maurice Clark).  One finds in Carter's Advanced Accounts such
expressions as flat cost, prime
cost and total cost.  And Professor Van Sickle,
Cost Accounting, p.4 says that `while cost accounting can be defined it is
quite
another thing to endeavour to define costs' ".</i>
<P>

<b>In connection with</b>
<P>

91   	The plaintiffs contended that the meaning of the phrase
"in connection with" depends on its context and the purpose of the

Commission is a highly significant requirement.  It was submitted that the word
"determine"
is used elsewhere in Part 3 of the Act to confer a discretion on
the Commission (s30B and s30D). It is submitted that its use in
s30E also gives
the Commission such a discretion (<b><i>Racecourse Cooperative Sugar

<P>

96   	The defendant submitted that s30E(3) makes clear the

<P>

<b>Second Reading Speeches</b>
<P>

97   	Once again I was referred to the Second Reading Speeches
in both the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council in relation
to
these amendments to assist in the understanding of the nature of the costs to
be deducted from the royalties.  
<P>

98   	In the Legislative Assembly Mr Causley referred to the
royalty apportionment scheme prior to 1985 and said:
<P>

<i>"That formula largely confined the costs that could be offset by the
Forestry Commission to those actually incurred in the provision
of roads,
bridges and other capital infrastructure necessary for a harvesting operation.
In effect, the range of costs actually incurred
in facilitating removal of
timber was far wider.  The old royalty sharing arrangements effectively left
many of the costs actually
borne by the Forestry Commission in connection with
the harvest of timber unaccounted for when royalty payments were assessed."
</i>
<P>

And later:
<P>

<i>"Unlike the old system, the new arrangements embodied in the legislation
before the House will permit the Forestry Commission to deduct
the costs
incurred in connection with the establishment, planting, maintenance and
improvement and protection of the timber, products
or forest materials the
subject of a licence, as well as the costs incurred in connection with the
actual taking of the timber. 
These provisions are intended to permit the
forestry Commission to offset against a landholder's share of royalties an
appropriate
part of the expenditure that in fact facilitated payment of the
royalty share... In practice, the proposed legislation will achieve
two things:
first, it will guarantee a fixed share of net royalty to the landholder of
Crown timber land;  and, it will permit the
recouping of those costs, including
associated administrative costs, incurred by the Forestry Commission in the
care, control, management
and ultimate harvesting of timber resources."</i>
<P>

99   	As to the intention of the legislation in respect of the
ability of the Commission to carry out its operations Mr Causley
said that this
could be done 
<P>

<i>"...in the knowledge that the cost of such activities and the associated
administrative costs will be fully recoverable upon the harvest
of the timber
to which they relate."  </i>
<P>

In relation to the way in which the costs are to be determined Mr Causley
said:
<P>

<i>"It is anticipated that the Forestry Commission will determine these costs
by reference to standard commercial accounting practices
as used in its
commercial accounts generally.  This is consistent with the commission's
commercial charter as confirmed by amendments
made by Parliament last year to
the banking and financial provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act</a>."  </i>
<P>

100   	The reference to the confirmation of the Commission's
commercial charter was a reference to the 1988 Amendment to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act</a>
whereby the Commission was given an express statutory power to open and
maintain an account with a Bank approved by the Treasury
and to expend amounts
up to $500,000 without the need to obtain approval from the Minister.  
<P>

101   	The Commission is subject to the provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pfaaa1983189/" class="autolink_findacts">Public
Finance and Audit Act 1983</a>.  It is required to keep proper accounts and records
in relation to all of its operations and in particular is required to prepare
and submit the financial statements to the Minister and Auditor General within
a period of six weeks after the financial year <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pfaaa1983189/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">(ss41</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pfaaa1983189/s41a.html" class="autolink_findacts">41A</a>).  The financial
statements are required to be prepared "having regard to current accounting
standards and industry practices" <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pfaaa1983189/s41b.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s41B).</a>
<P>

<b>Interpretation of s30E</b>
<P>

102   	The royalty scheme set up under this legislation had a
dual purpose.  As referred to in my reasons in relation to the Bromley
Compensation Claim one of its purposes was to compensate the lessee for
damage/disturbance to the lessee's interests in the leasehold
by licensed
timber or harvesting operations.
<P>

103   	The other purpose was to enable the Commission to offset
against a landholder's share of royalty what was described as "an
appropriate
part of the expenditure that in fact facilitated payment of the royalty share".
Certainty it was thought that this was
a scheme intended to enable the
Commission to offset costs additional to those that it had previously been able
to offset. These
were the matters in s30E(2)(b) although, on one view, it may
have been possible to take these into account under the previous s30K(3)(a)
in
the former compensation scheme.
<P>

104   	The reference in the Second Reading Speech to the
anticipation that the Forestry Commission would determine the costs "by
reference to standard commercial accounting practices as used in its commercial
accounts generally" was in my view a recognition
that the Commission would be
preparing accounts that would assist it in determining costs pursuant to
s30E(3).
<P>

105   	This does not mean that simply because a cost was
included in the commercial accounts of the Commission  it would be appropriate
to deduct it from the share of royalty irrespective of whether it fell within
the prescriptions in s30E(2)(b) or (c).  Such an interpretation
would in my
opinion run counter to the spirit  and purpose of the legislation.
<P>

106   	In my view it was intended that in determining costs the
Commission would refer to those accounts to identify the "appropriate
part of
the expenditure" that should be deducted pursuant to the prescription in
s30E(2)(b) and (c).  It was not intended that the
costs in the accounts were to
be the costs as determined. They had to be costs as "incurred in connection
with" the matters referred
to in s30E(2)(b) or (c).
<P>

107   	I am assisted in the interpretation of this section by
the approach adopted by Priestley JA in <b>Allsands Pty Ltd v Shoalhaven City
Council</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2029%20NSWLR%20596" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 29 NSWLR 596.</a>  In that case the Court was considering the
terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s94.html" class="autolink_findacts">s94(2A)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/" class="autolink_findacts">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979</a> in which
a local council could subject a development consent to a condition requiring
the payment of the monetary contribution towards
"recoupment of the cost" of
providing public amenities in the area being developed.
<P>

108   	The council had adopted a method of fixing the
contribution figures under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s94.html" class="autolink_findacts">s94</a> and in doing so created a formula which required
the estimation of the written down "current cost" of the asset value. In
considering
the meaning of the word "cost" in the phrase "recoupment of cost"
Priestly JA came to the conclusion that it was reasonably clear
that the word
must be referring to "actual cost" (p 606F). His honour was of the view that
the words within the section seemed to
be directed towards actual cash amounts
in respect to both contribution and recoupment. He said at 607A:
<P>

<i>"The first of these is `recoupment', which in its context carries a strong
idea of getting back something paid out. The other word,
`cost', also usually
carries the meaning of an amount paid out."</i>
<P>

109   	Priestley JA analysed the relationship between the
various subsections for the purpose of placing the word "cost" in context
and
went on to say at 607D:
<P>

<i>"The words of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s94.html" class="autolink_findacts">s94(2A)</a> do not justify estimating `cost' either by taking
present day cost and discounting it, or by applying an index to historical
cost.
 The first method might yield a result approximating historical cost.  On
the other hand, it might not, which is what, in my opinion,
prevents it being
supportable by the words of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s94.html" class="autolink_findacts">s94(2A).</a>  The second method in its own terms
produces a figure different from historical cost.  But it is historical cost,
that is, what the
council actually paid out, that the subsection is in my
opinion referring to.  Any estimating must be done with a view to arriving
at
that `cost', and it is towards that cost that payment of a monetary
contribution may be required as a condition of consent."</i>
<P>

110   	Similarly I am of the view that the words within Division
3 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a> and more particularly <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s30e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s30E</a> are directed towards cash
amounts or cash notions both in respect of royalty and costs incurred.  The
landholder receives a cash
payment as a particular share of the royalty.  It is
referred to as a "balance" remaining after deduction of particular amounts.

<P>

111   	Having regard to the dual purpose of this legislation I
am of the view that the "royalty" is the actual royalty not one that
has been
indexed or upon which some calculation of interest has been made over the 12
month period to which it related.  I am also
of the view that the "costs
incurred" are the actual costs incurred in connection with the matters referred
to in subs(2)(b) &amp;
(c) not those that have been indexed to reach what has
been referred to in these proceedings as current costs.
<P>

112   	In taking into account each parties' submissions in
relation to the meaning of the words "in connection with" in the section
it is
also important to have regard to the more recent history of the legislation
since 1984.  Under the compensation scheme that
was in place between 1984 and
1989 in the now repealed Division 5 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s30k.html" class="autolink_findacts">s30K(3)</a> required that in making any
assessment of compensation:
<P>

<i>(3).. the commission shall take into consideration the effects (both
beneficial and detrimental) on the land, and on any roads, fences,
gates,
buildings or works situated on the land, of -</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	the operations carried out on the land for the purpose of taking timber,
products or forests materials, as the case may be, on
or from the land;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the construction (whether or not on the land) of roads, bridges, gates
and ramps, and any incidental works, associated with those
operations;
and</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	such other matters as may be prescribed</i>
<P>

113   	The focus in the compensation scheme was on the effects
on the land of the landholder. It is presumed that if the detrimental
effects
of the timber operations and/or the associated construction works outweighed
the beneficial effects on that particular landholding
the commission would
award some compensation.
<P>

114   	The present scheme, having as one of its purposes the
compensation of the landholder, recognises the previous beneficial
effects of
the construction works as a permissible deduction from the royalty payable to
the landholder ins30E(2)(c) as:
<P>

<i>(c)	any costs incurred by the commission in connection with the facilitation
of the taking of the timber, products or forest materials,
including the costs
of construction and maintenance of roads, bridges, gates ramps and incidental
works.</i>
<P>

115   	The reference in the Second Reading Speeches to the
Commission's capacity in the present system to offset its costs against
royalties is not dissimilar to the previous system which necessarily involved
weighing the beneficial effects against the detrimental
effects on the land.
The new system expressly included or alternatively extended the category of
beneficial effects or costs that
the commission was entitled to deduct from the
royalty in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s30e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s30E(2)(b):</a>
<P>

<i>(b)	any costs incurred by the commission in connection with the
establishment, planting, maintenance, improvement and protection of
the timber,
products or forest materials.</i>
<P>

116   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s30e.html" class="autolink_findacts">S30E(2)</a> requires the Commission to pay one-third of the
balance of the royalty after the deduction of the costs incurred to "the
landholder
concerned". The use of the word "concerned" may be described as a
little lax and in  the interpretation of such a term it is appropriate
to look
to the object intended to be attained by its use (<b>Nutton v Wilson </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281888%29%2022%20QBD%20744" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1888)
22 QBD 744</a> per Lindley LJ at 748).
<P>

117   	In my view the object to be attained is the payment of
one-third of the balance of a particular royalty to a particular landholder.
The particular royalty is that which is received from the licensed operations
on that landholder's land. It is not intended that
the royalty received in
respect of some other landholder's land should be the subject of payment to
this particular landholder. 
<P>

118   	Equally the object is to deduct costs incurred which
relate to the landholder concerned. The costs incurred that are deducted
must
be in connection with the establishment, planting, maintenance, improvement and
protection of the timber, products, or forest
materials of the particular
landholder or in connection with the facilitation of the taking of the timber,
products or forest materials
of the particular landholder. 
<P>

119   	There may be costs incurred in connection with the
particular landholder or landholder concerned that are also costs incurred
in
connection with another landholder. Take for example the costs of contruction
of a bridge over a creek that facilitates access
to neighbouring leases. The
cost of this construction would be a permissible deduction, appropriately
apportioned, from the royalty
of each landholder.  It may also be a permissible
deduction from each even if it only provides access to one of the leases but
facilitates
the protection work on that lease so as to protect the timber on
the neighbouring lease.
<P>

120   	In a wider context the Commission may incur costs in
connection with the protection of the timber on the land of a particular
landholder which may benefit all landholders.  Take for example the overheads
incurred in the development of a particular technique
to protect timber from
fire which is applied to the particular landholder's timber. Once again so long
as they are costs in connection
with the particular landholding the cost,
appropriately apportioned, could be deducted.
<P>

121   	I accept the plaintiff's submission that the phrase "in
connection with" in the context of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s30e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s30E</a> requires an apportionment process to be
adopted to ensure that costs of the construction or acquisition of assets which
may have
been constructed or acquired for a number of purposes are not the sole
burden of the lessee who benefits from but one of the purposes.
<P>

122   	I conclude that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s30e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s30E</a> requires the commission to pay to
the plaintiffs one-third of the balance of the royalties received  in respect
of timber, products
or forest materials taken on and from their respective
leases.  I am further of the view that the balance is to be reached by the
deduction of the actual amounts paid out or borne by the Commission,
appropriately apportioned, in connection with: 
<P>

(a)	the establishment, planting, maintenance, improvement and protection of the
timber, products or forest materials on the land
within plaintiffs leases;
and/or 
<P>

(b)	the facilitation of the taking of the timber, products or forest materials
on or from the land in the plaintiff's leases.
<P>

<b>Approach to be adopted</b>
<P>

123   	The parties' respective approaches to the basis upon
which the Court can review the Commission's determinations are consistent,
although expressed differently. The plaintiffs allege that the determinations
purportedly made by the defendant pursuant to s30E(3)
of the Act were
determinations:
<P>

(a)	in which costs were deducted which were not incurred as prescribed by
s30E(2)(b) or (c);
<P>

(b)	which took into account irrelevant matters which should not have been taken
into account; and
<P>

(c)	which failed to take into account matters which should have been taken into
account.
<P>

The plaintiffs also claim that the defendant acted wholly unreasonably in
making its determinations under s30E(3) of the Act (<b>Minister for Aboriginal
Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281968%29%20162%20CLR%2024" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1968) 162 CLR 24</a>;  <b>Associated Provincial

<P>

124   	The defendant submitted that the determination by the
Commission under s30E(3) can only be attacked on administrative law
grounds.
In that respect reliance was placed on <b>Foley v Padley</b><i> </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/50.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 50</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20154%20CLR%20349" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 154

applied the statements of Latham CJ in <b>R v Connell;  Ex parte Hetton

Latham CJ warrant emphasis in this case.  His Honour said at p 430:
<P>

<i>"Thus, where the existence of a particular opinion is made a condition of
the exercise of power, legislation conferring the power
is treated as referring
to an opinion which is such that it can be formed by a reasonable man who
correctly understands the meaning
of the law under which he acts.  If it is
shown that the opinion actually formed is not an opinion of this character,
then the necessary
opinion does not exist."</i>
<P>

And at p 432:
<P>

"<i>It should be emphasised that the application of the principle now under
discussion does not mean that the court substitutes its opinion
for the opinion
of the person or authority in question.  What the court does is to inquire
whether the opinion required by the relevant
legislative provision has really
been formed.  If the opinion which was in fact formed was reached by taking
into account irrelevant
considerations or by otherwise misconstruing the terms
of the relevant legislation, then it must be held that the opinion required
has
not been formed.  In that event the basis for the exercise of power is absent,
just as if it were shown that the opinion was
arbitrary, capricious,
irrational, or not bona fide."</i>
<P>

125   	I was also referred to the decision in <b>Bruce v
Cole</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2045%20NSWLR%20163" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 45 NSWLR 163</a> in particular to the judgment of Spigelman CJ at

at 118 -119:
<P>

<i>"Whether the decision of the authority under such a statute can be
effectively reviewed by the courts will often largely depend on
the nature of
the matters of which the authority is required to be satisfied.  In all such
cases the authority must act in good faith;
 it cannot act merely arbitrarily
or capriciously.  Moreover, a person affected will obtain relief from the
courts if he can show
that the authority has misdirected itself in law or that
it has failed to consider matters that it was required to consider or has
taken
irrelevant matters into account.   Even if none of these things can be
established, the courts will interfere  if the decision
reached by the
authority appears so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could properly
have arrived at it.  However where the
matter of which the authority is
required to be satisfied is a matter of opinion or policy or taste it may be
very difficult to show
that it has erred in one of these ways, or that its
decision could not reasonably have been reached.  In such cases the authority
will be left with a very wide discretion which cannot be effectively reviewed
by the courts".</i>
<P>

126   	This passage in <b>Buck v Bavone</b> has recently been
considered in <b>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs for
Commonwealth of Australia;  Ex parte Moges Eshetu</b><i> </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20162%20CLR%20577" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 162 CLR
577.</a>  Gummow J said at p 609, par 137:
<P>

<i>"This passage is consistent with the proposition that, where the criterion
of which the authority is required to be satisfied turns
upon factual matters
upon which reasonable minds could reasonably differ, it will be very difficult
to show that no reasonable decision-maker
could have arrived at the decision in
question.  It may be otherwise if the evidence which establishes or denies or,
with other matters,
goes to establish or to deny, that the necessary criterion
has been met was all one way"</i>.
<P>

127   	To decide this part of the plaintiffs claims it is
necessary to have some understanding of the accounting operations of the
Commission and the determinations that were made by the Commission.
<P>

<b>Accounting Operations of the Commission</b>
<P>

128   	The operations of the Commission are organised
geographically into . separate regions and within those regions into separate
districts.  Up to the end of 1991 there were nine regions and forty-five
districts throughout New South Wales.  At the time of the
hearing of this
matter the number of regions had been reduced to five and the number of
districts to twenty-nine.
<P>

129   	Up to the end of 1991 the Commission maintained a
predominantly manual accounting system in which costs were captured on
hand
written cards and later compiled in summary form by automated processes. There
was a Chart of Accounts which was known internally
as the Standard Job List.
This was used throughout the Commission as the basis for costing expenditure
and for capturing costs into
two broad activities (1) commercial operations and
(2) non commercial operations.  
<P>

130   	The Commission's commercial operations covered what was
described as the core forest management business. The eight (8) categories
or
projects within the commercial operations were growing stock; capital
expenditure; maintenance; protection; public relations;
research and
experiment; overheads; and marketing operations. In the Chart of Accounts these
categories were broken down into approximately
280 separate jobs and were
identified with separate job numbers.
<P>

131   	Non-commercial operations encompassed non-core services
such as the provision of community fire fighting services and public
recreational facilities.  
<P>

132   	The Chart of Accounts dealt with each of the categories
of the commercial operations and the Commission approached the costing
of
expenditure within these categories on the following basis:
<P>

Growing Stock:   These were direct costs relating to what was described as the
pre-establishment and ongoing maintenance of the
forest. It included clearing
burning, planting, culling/thinning of timber stands, fertilising and
pruning.
<P>

Capital Expenditure:	 These included costs of and associated with the purchase
of land, the purchase or construction of buildings
and fire towers, the
construction of roads, fences, landing fields and aircraft.
<P>

Maintenance:	 These costs were said to refer to any expenditure designed to
ensure that there was no significant deterioration in
the condition of the
asset. It included expenditure relating to roads and bridges (including soil
erosion mitigation, grading, gravelling
and the replacement of drainage
structures such as pipes culverts and sumps); buildings and installations
(including work camps,
headquarters, depots, fences, water supplies, offices
and holiday camps); and forests (including timber inventory/assessments,
hydrology
equipment installation and maintenance).
<P>

Protection:   These were the direct costs associated with protection of the
forest estate and included fire fighting, control burning,
noxious weed and
plant disease control, control of feral animals and catchment management -
water quality upkeep.
<P>

Public Relations:   These were the direct costs associated with forestry
publications, construction and maintenance of recreation
areas, supervision of
aboriginal sites, emergency relief services and costs associated with
rangers.
<P>

Research/Experiment:    These were the direct costs associated with the
investigation into all matters associated with forest management
and included
forest silviculture techniques, tree breeding, fire research, wood
preservation, log storage studies and wood properties.
<P>

Overheads:   These were the indirect cost associated with the administration of
the district regional or head office which could
not be directly attributed to
a forest. It included telecommunication costs, plant maintenance, safety
training, safety equipment
and clothing and environmental impact studies.
and
<P>

Marketing Operations:   These were the direct costs associated with the
harvesting of timber and related products. They included
harvesting, planning,
tree marking, measuring, supervision of operations and reject tree
allowance.
<P>

133   	During the period in which the manual accounting system
was in place costs incurred by the Commission were recorded as they
were
incurred at the district level, regional level or head office level.  The
primary accounting records for direct (non overhead)
costs were time sheets for
wages staff, vehicle logs and individual expenses vouchers.  Salaried staff did
not maintain time sheets
and their salaries were accounted for as overheads.

<P>

134   	The time sheets, vehicle logs and individual expense
vouchers were collected fortnightly and processed by office staff in
accordance
with the Chart of Accounts. An accounting unit prefix was attached to each cost
in addition to the allocation of the specific
job number.
<P>

135   	An accounting unit comprised either a geographic forest
type classification or a district/regional/head office overhead classification.
In the Newcastle Region there were six districts (Wyong, Buladelah, Cessnock,
Dungog, Gloucester and Muswellbrook) and each had a
number of accounting units
within them. Additionally the Newcastle region itself had a number of
accounting units. 
<P>

136   	These units were identified with particular symbols. In
the Gloucester district, where the plaintiffs leases are, there were
six
accounting units - Barrington BFPA with the symbol NGB, Clarence BFPA with the
symbol NGC, Hardwoods with the symbol NGG, Oxley
BFPA with the symbol NGO,
Putty BFPA with the symbol NGP and District with the symbol NGX.
<P>

137   	The Newcastle Region had seven accounting units. They
were Sundry Deposits with the symbol NXD, Guarantees with the symbol
NXG, Leave
with the symbol NXL, Nurseries with the symbol NXN, Stock with the symbol NXS,
General with the symbol NXX and Hardwoods
with the symbol NXZ.
<P>

138   	It was possible to identify the item of expenditure by
the use of the job numbers and symbols for the accounting units. For
example a
job number 823 was designated safety training costs. If the item of expenditure
was labelled NGX823 it was understood that
it was a cost incurred or allocated
in the District accounting unit of the Gloucester District for safety
training.
<P>

139   	All the costs in the manual card system were totalled and
transferred to a quarterly statement of expenditure and forwarded
to head
office.  The fourth quarter return of the statement of expenditure was used to
compile the management accounts for each accounting
unit.
<P>

140   	In December 1991 the Commission converted from a manual
accounting system to a fully automated accounting system know internally
as the
Financial and Management Reporting System (FMRS). FMRS produced monthly
management accounts by profit centres rather than
by accounting units.
<P>

141   	Under the FMRS costs are still initially recorded in the
time sheets for wages staff, the vehicle logs and the individual
expense
vouchers. These are then entered into the local computer based systems and each
month electronic files are transmitted to
Head Office. Following the monthly
receipt of these files a central electronic file is created. Monthly management
accounts are created
from this central electronic file for what has been
described as the "responsibility centre", which is presumably the profit
centre.
These files are consolidated to produce regional consolidated
management reports and ultimately one consolidated report on the activities
of
the Commission.
<P>

<b>The Commission's s30E(3) Determinations</b>
<P>

142   	The 1989 amendments to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a> phasing out
the compensation scheme and re-introducing the royalty scheme commenced
operation on 24 November 1989.  Prior to the
commencement a Marketing Officer
of the Commission developed various formulae to assist the Commission in making
determinations under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s30e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s30E(3)</a> as to what costs were to be deducted from the
gross royalties pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s30e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s30E(2)(b)</a>&amp;(c).
<P>

143   	On 29 January 1990 the Commission issued a circular to
its staff entitled "Forestry (Amendment) Act 1989.Restoration of royalty
shares
to landholders". It has been referred to in the proceedings as Circular 1112.
In addressing the requirements under s30E(3)
the circular stated:
<P>

<i>The basis of some cost determinations should be the Regional Management
Accounts for the relevant species group rather than the accounting
unit.</i>
<P>

<i>Relevant costs are considered to be those incurred in growing stock,
maintenance, protection, research, short-life roads, administration,
and
marketing, as well as depreciation and amortisation in certain instances.
Administration costs should be taken from the Region
species group management
Accounts Summary, with all others taken from the relevant local accounting unit
Management Accounts.</i>
<P>

144   	The circular then provided formulae for the calculation
of deductible costs for marketing expenditure, road maintenance,
protection,
research, short-life roads, overheads and depreciation and amortisation.  The
circular reported that the method for determining
the deductible costs would be
reviewed after 12 months.
<P>

145   	By July 1990 the Commission had cause for reviewing the
maintenance, region and head office overheads, and depreciation aspects
of the
method of determination of costs under s30E(3).  The cause, although not
detailed, was said to be a "particular set of circumstances"
where the use of
the formulae in circular 1112 "would have resulted in payments to lessees at
variance with the intentions of the
1989 amendment of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s30e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s30E</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry
Act</a>".
<P>

146   	The Secretary of the Commission issued a circular
numbered 5731.  In relation to the depreciation cost a Regional Forester
was
given permission to refine the formula by categorising roads into those fully
depreciated and those not fully depreciated. The
circular stated:
<P>

<i>The decision to refine this statement may be made by the Regional Forester
in the interests of obtaining a more accurate assessment
of the true costs
attributed to leasehold logging. The procedure should not be refined to obtain
a better result for either party
in a particular year.</i>
<P>

147   	If this approach was to be adopted the circular required
accurate records of roads to be kept to enable segregation of roads
at the time
the lessee's share of royalty was calculated.  The circular further provided
that if fully depreciated roads were used
for leasehold logging there was to be
nil cost for this item.
<P>

148   	On 2 August 1990 the Secretary of the Commission
circulated a memo dealing with the method of determination subsequent to
the
issue of circular 5731. The memo stated:
<P>

<i>Subsequent calculations have shown that inequities still appear to exist
between lessees.</i>
<P>

And in stressing that the following action was to apply only until there was a
general review of the method of determination the
memo stated:
<P>

<i>Circular 1112 provides for a review of the system of Lessee share
calculation after 12 months. In the meantime to ease the effect
of the
anomalies which might still exist in the system, it has been approved that a
minimum level of royalty payment, equivalent
to 5% of gross royalties derived
from each lease will be made to the relevant lessees.</i>
<P>

<i>In situations where the lessee would otherwise be entitled to a payment
which was less than 5% of gross revenue derived from the lease,
a management
contingency figure should be shown on the worksheet as a negative value, which
will effectively reduce costs such that
one third of net royalties is
equivalent to 5% of gross royalties. In the subsequent advice to the lessee,
this management contingency
will be reflected in the level of "Administration
costs".</i>
<P>

149   	It seems further difficulties were encountered and on 5
April 1991 the Assistant Commissioner of the Commission advised the
Minister
for Tourism, Lands &amp; Forests that:
<P>

<i>The Lessee royalty apportionment scheme established in 1989 was designed to
cope with the range of situations and to accurately reflect
the costs of
generating royalty on a lease by lease basis. It was intended to review the
procedures once sufficient experience and
data were obtained.</i>
<P>

<i>Because of the complex calculations involved in the scheme and the wide
range of royalty share proportions experienced so far, the
Commission has
decided to undertake a review of the procedures with a view to
simplification.</i>
<P>

150   	In dealing with the adoption of the 5% minimum royalty
payment the Assistant Commissioner advised:
<P>

<i>The appropriateness of the 5 percent minimum is a subjective judgment. Some
disturbance is involved with logging and it was considered
inappropriate that
the Lessee may not receive any recompense at all. Therefore 5 percent was
chosen as a reasonable minimum to fulfil
the objectives of the legislation and
compensate the Lessee for disturbance, regardless of the costs associated with
the particular
lease.</i>
<P>

151   	The review was completed in late 1991 and on 10 December
1991 the Chairman of the Conservation and Land Management Committee
advised the
Minister for Conservation and Land management that the Committee had finalised
the review. The Chairman advised:
<P>

<i>As a result of its deliberations the Committee recommends to you that the
scheme be modified as follows;</i>
<P>

<i>*	averaging provisions should be introduced for non-access related costs at
40%;</i>
<P>

<i>*	the minimum lessee share should be fixed at 10%.</i>
<P>

<i>Also the Committee feels that relief should be offered to those lessees who
have been severely impacted by the operation of the scheme
in its current form.
Your consideration of an ex-gratia payment or equivalent to lessees who are
able to demonstrate unfairness or
other special circumstances would be
appreciated.</i>
<P>

152   	On 4 August 1992 Circular 1112 was amended and
circulated. The new system was to apply from 1 January 1992 and provided that
costs as determined were " made up of a management charge plus access cost".
The forest management charge was determined as 40% of
the gross royalty
received in respect of the lease.  The charge for use of permanent roads was
determined as 0.74% of gross royalty
from the lease per kilometre of road used.
It was also determined that the minimum share of royalty for a lessee was 10%
of gross
royalty. This was applied in instances where deduction of the Forestry
Management charge and Access cost from the gross royalty resulted
in a balance
of less than 30% of the gross royalty.
<P>

153   	Charles Maurice Mackowski, Ecologist, was the person
requested to perform the review which resulted in this new system. He
conducted
the review in 1991 and early 1992 when he was employed as a Marketing Officer
with the Commission. His qualifications at
that time were Bachelor of Science
(Forestry) and Master of Resource Science. He had no formal accounting
qualifications.
<P>

154   	The method utilised by Mr Mackowski in this review
warrants close analysis because his conclusions were adopted as the
determinations
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s30e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s30E(3)</a> of the costs to be deducted under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s30e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s30E(2)(b)</a>&amp;(c) for the period 1992 to 1996.  They were contained in the
amended circular 1112 referred to above.
<P>

155   	Mr Mackowski understood that the purpose of his review
was to simplify Circular 1112. He was requested to work out a much
simpler
system of calculating the deductible costs.  He was also requested to work out
a more equitable system.
<P>

156   	One of the considerations in his review was to reduce and
contain the costs of calculating the costs to be deducted under
s30E(2)(b)&amp;(c) of the Act.  He understood that to that time the Commission
had been incurring considerable costs in carrying
out these calculations.
<P>

157   	The materials with which Mr Mackowski was supplied to
conduct his review were Circular 1112 and the subsequent circulars
relevant to
it and the calculations or work sheets prepared in respect of each lease in New
South Wales at the district level.
<P>

158   	The district calculation sheets related to the royalties
that had been paid and the calculations of the costs that were deducted
in
respect of all of the leases in New South Wales between November 1989 and the
end of July 1991.  
<P>

159   	Mr Mackowski used the Excel Spreadsheet Software and
created a spreadsheet for each individual lease.  Within the spreadsheet
he
created a separate row for entry for each of the items in the cost structure of
each of the costs that had been deducted from
the royalties received in respect
of each lease.  
<P>

160   	After the data had been entered into the spreadsheets Mr
Mackowski looked at what are called scattergraphs and "did what
the
statistician called teasing the data".  He said:
<P>

<i>"I explored the data to see what relationships were obvious to the eye
before having a go at looking at any relationships statistically,
probably
sound."</i>
<P>

He also said:
<P>

<i>"I had columns of costs and columns of other parameters...and I just did an
exploratory assessment, statistical assessment of the
information in there and
the patterns I got from the ones I finally settled on."  </i>
<P>

161   	After looking at the scattergraphs Mr Mackowski went back
and did a standard deviation on the relationship of costs to royalty
and if the
standard deviation was greater than 30% the particular instance was not
selected.
<P>

162   	In giving an example as to how he approached his task he
referred to marketing costs and said:
<P>

<i>"Marketing costs were a certain component of gross royalty and that was the
best I could get for it.  And then I looked at the other
costs and the way of
harmonising.  I don't know if that is the right word but the way of getting
uniformity was a way of getting
a figure which that was applicable across all
leases as best as possible, was to get all the management costs, if you like,
and say
they were 40 percent or something".</i>
<P>

163   	By this process Mr Mackowski arrived at a particular
relationship between costs and royalty and recommended that a figure
of 40% was
an appropriate percentage to charge for forest management and 0.74% an
appropriate percentage to apply in respect of roading
costs.
<P>

164   	He admitted that 0.74% was arrived at by an averaging
process.  He said it was an estimate but suggested it was a tight estimate
of
the average of roading costs of all leases in the State.
<P>

165   	He frankly acknowledged that neither the Forest
Management charge (40% of royalty) nor the roading costs figure (0.74% of
royalty) were "actual costs" that may have been incurred by the Commission.
<P>

<b>Review of the Commission's s30E(3) determinations</b>
<P>

166   	Mr Gageler submitted that the determinations made by the
Commission pursuant to s30E(3) were reasonable.  He submitted that
unless the
Commission was to dramatically change its whole system of accounting upon the
introduction of the amendments in 1989 the
determination of the costs required
to be deducted pursuant to s30E(2)(b) and (c) necessarily involved the
Commission in apportioning
the costs captured and recorded for district wide
accounting units to individual leases.
<P>

167   	In support of this last submission Mr Gageler relied upon
the evidence of Neil Victor Hunt who was during the relevant period
employed by
the defendant as the manager of the internal audit branch of the Commission and
subsequently as the financial accountant.
 Mr Hunt gave evidence that neither
the manual accounting system nor FMRS provided for the capturing or recording
of costs on the
lease specific basis.  His evidence was that whilst the
capturing of costs on a lease specific basis would have been possible he
suggested that such a system would be practically unworkable given the nature
of the costs involved.  
<P>

168   	He went on to say that the defendant's operations are
undertaken in areas remote from district headquarters and that the
operations
cover vast areas which require extensive travel.  It was suggested that these
factors generally preclude undertaking tasks
on an individual basis which in
turn preclude many significant costs from being project specific.
<P>

169   	The main thrust of Mr Gageler's submission therefore was
that the legislature did not intend the Commission to have to dramatically
change its whole system of accounting and therefore it was permissible for it
to make the determinations it did.  I will deal further
with these submissions
when I come to the specific complaints made by the plaintiffs in respect of
these determinations.
<P>

170   	Mr Gageler also submitted that the methodology employed
by the Commission in applying the forest management charge of 40%
and a
permanent road charge of 0.74% of gross royalty was reasonable.  He submitted
that the decision to adopt the simplified method
was made on the recommendation
of a Parliamentary Committee which had been presented with both Mr Mackowski's
findings and information
relating to the administrative difficulties caused by
the complexity of the earlier methodology.  
<P>

171   	I have no doubt that Mr Mackowski attended to the
requests made of him as diligently as possible. He was asked to simplify
circular 1112 and it appears he certainly achieved that outcome.  His brief to
lessen the costs burden on the Commission in the calculation
of these costs,
although not the subject of specific evidence, can be assessed as successfully
completed by reason of the relative
simplicity of the new system.
<P>

172   	It is clear from the evidence that from the commencement
of the royalty scheme in 1989 the Commission was concerned that
the
determinations it had made were impacting adversely on the lessees by failing
to provide reasonable compensation to them.  This
much was recognised in the
Assistant Commissioner's advice to the Minister in relation to the fixing of
the minimum share of royalty
at 5%.
<P>

173   	This seems to have been a recognition that the system was
unfair or alternatively lacked proportionality. Part of the rectification
of
it, as the Commission saw it, was the determination of 5% of the gross royalty
as the lessees' minimum share.  
<P>

174   	Although this determination may have been a well meaning
attempt to adjust what the Commission saw as the anomalies and unreasonable
results of its previous determinations it did not proceed upon a proper
understanding of the requirements under s30E of the legislation.
It was
admitted to be a subjective judgment but it paid no regard to determining the
costs incurred prescribed in s30E2(b) or (c)
as required under s30E(3). 
<P>

175   	This approach infected the next phase of the Commission's
determination in adopting the results of Mr Mackowski's review.
 
<P>

176   	It is apparent from the evidence, particularly the
annexures to Mr Mackowski's affidavit, that the Commission was motivated
by a
consciousness that although the previous compensation scheme had provided the
lessee with the entitlement to have the assessment
of compensation reviewed
there was no equivalent entitlement in respect of the share of royalty under
the amending legislation.
<P>

177   	The system about which the Commission had been so worried
that it had ordered a review and fixed an interim 5% minimum royalty
share was
the very basis of the future system.  All Mr Mackowski did was to "tease the
data" of the costs that had been allegedly
incurred over the previous twelve
month period for all the leases of New South Wales and relate them to the
royalties received in
relation to all the leases of New South Wales.
<P>

178   	This paid absolutely no regard to the actual costs
incurred in the period during which the royalty was received. The percentages
were applied irrespective of whether the actual costs incurred were $1 or $1
million.  In my view this was clearly a misconstruing
of the requirements of
the legislation.  It took into account costs of another time irrespective of
the amount of costs during the
period for which the royalty was received.  It
also locked the system in to what had been recognised by the Commission as one
that
was anomalous and needed a subjective fixation of a 5% minimum to attempt
to dilute its unreasonable results.  
<P>

179   	It can be seen from the new system that commenced in 1992
that the Commission was still concerned about the anomalous situation
that had
arisen.  It lifted the minimum share of royalty for the lessee from 5% of gross
royalty to 10% of gross royalty.  These
determinations require closer
analysis.
<P>

180   	When the Secretary of the Commission fixed the minimum at
5% of gross royalty in his circular of 2 August 1990 he directed
the staff to
enter a management contingency figure in the work sheets as a negative value.
He suggested that that would effectively
reduce costs "such that one-third of
net royalties is equivalent to 5% of gross royalties".  In the 1992 circular
amending the system
the direction was that a contingency allowance should be
applied to the Forest Management Charge so that net royalty equals 30% of
gross
royalty.  
<P>

181   	What the lessee was required to be paid was one-third of
the balance of the royalty after deduction of costs incurred.  There
does not
appear to have been any assessment of whether such a minimum would be less than
what the lessee was truly entitled to had
the actual costs incurred been
determined. 
<P>

182   	The Commission seems also to have been motivated to
achieve a result that would give lessees similar shares of royalty irrespective
of the different costs incurred in different areas.   This much can be gleaned
from the concerns that there were "anomalous" results.
 In other words some
results deviated from what the Commission thought was normal or expected.  
<P>

183   	I am of the view that although the Commission may have
been well-intentioned it made its determinations in relation to the
1992 to
1996 deductible costs without properly understanding the requirements and
obligations placed upon it to pay to the lessee
one-third of the balance of the
royalty after deduction of the costs incurred as prescribed in s30E(2)(b) and
(c).  I am also of
the view that these determinations were so unreasonable that
no reasonable person in this position could have made them.
<P>

184   	I shall deal now with the specific complaints made by the
plaintiffs in these proceedings.       
<P>

<b><u>Claims in respect of costs deducted in the period January1990 to December
1991</u></b>
<P>

185   	The Commission deducted marketing costs, roading costs,
protection costs and administration costs from the gross royalties
received in
respect of the plaintiffs' leases to arrive at the balance which it referred to
as the net royalty.  The plaintiffs were
then paid one-third (1/3) of the net
royalty.
<P>

186   	The plaintiffs make no claim in respect of the marketing
costs but attack the roading, protection and administration costs.
<P>

187   	Each of the parties relied upon expert evidence in
support of their cases.  The plaintiffs relied upon the report and evidence
of
Stephen Robertson, a principal within the Performance Improvement Group of
Ernst &amp; Young.  The defendant relied upon the reports
and evidence of Frank
Otto Fischl a partner of the firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers working in the
Dispute Analysis and Investigation
section of that firm.
<P>

188   	The experts were called to give evidence prior to Mr
Mackowski giving evidence in relation to the method he used in the review.
Neither expert was recalled to comment upon this method nor did their reports
deal with it although each expressed an opinion upon
the appropriateness of the
percentage of gross royalty charge. 
<P>

189   	Mr Robertson was critical of the Commission's use of
royalty revenue as a cost driver.  He proffered the opinion that revenue
was
not a cost driver at all and said that it is what the market has paid for the
product and is therefore absolutely unrelated to
the incurring of costs.
<P>

190   	Mr Fischl did not agree with this proposition.  However
he did agree that there were alternative cost drivers to revenue
or royalty.
For instance in the case of planting costs he agreed that rather than using
revenue as a cost driver one could use the
actual number of trees that may have
been planted during the relevant period.  He also agreed that an alternative
cost driver in
calculating protection costs could have been the number of acres
or hectares of forested areas rather than the royalty or revenue.
 Although
this agreement was qualified to "all things being equal" he did not explain
what that meant.
<P>

191   	A debate occurred between the two experts as to whether
activity based costing was the only or most appropriate method of
cost
accounting to be utilised in calculating costs.  I need not go into the detail
of this debate because I have formed the view
that the Commission was not
entitled to approach the determination of costs by saying that it had to reach
certain conclusions because
of the way in which its accounts are prepared.
Additionally it is clear that in the 1990 to 1991 period the costs were
captured based
on specific activities.  Mr Fischl was not aware of any reason
why such a system could not have continued after 1992.
<P>

<b>Roading costs</b>
<P>

192   	During this period the deduction of roading costs were
made pursuant to the formulae included in circular 1112 issued in
January 1990.
 Road maintenance costs were determined by dividing the total of certain
project 3 jobs (job 4 assistance to Shire-Road
maintenance;  job 8 forest
roads, culverts and bridges (including signs); and job 10 forest road -
grading) on a district basis by
total revenue from the district.  This division
then reached what was identified as the "maintenance ratio".  The maintenance
ratio
was then multiplied by the gross revenue from the particular lease in
question.  
<P>

193   	Annual depreciation associated with the cost of existing
permanent roads in an accounting unit was calculated by first taking
the
original cost of construction of each road, adjusting that cost to current cost
by the application of indexing and amortising
that cost over either five,
fifteen or twenty years.  In other words dividing the total current cost by the
number of years to determine
the cost applicable to the current year.
<P>

194   	The Commission said that the total annual depreciation,
for all permanent roads in the accounting unit was calculated by
then adding
the depreciation figure as so calculated for each road.  The total figure was
then apportioned to an individual road
by dividing the length of the relevant
road used to log the lease by the total lengths of permanent roads within the
accounting unit.
 That value was further apportioned to individual landholders
by multiplying it by the royalty from the relevant lease divided by
the total
gross royalty of logs transported over the road from all landholders.  
<P>

195   	The indexing applied used the mean increases in CPI
Sydney (All Groups) and AWE (Employed Male Unit) NSW.  
<P>

<u>First complaint - indexing construction costs of roads</u>
<P>

196   	The first complaint made by the plaintiffs in respect of
the determination of roading costs to be deducted was that the Commission
deducted the current costs of construction by applying an index to the actual
cost of construction.  It was submitted that the Commission
should have
deducted only the actual costs of construction. 
<P>

197   	The plaintiffs submitted that the application of the
indexing created an inflated figure which is a false figure.  Mr Robertson
opined that the use of current costs artificially inflates the actual costs.
Mr Fischl did not comment upon this matter and Mr Martin
made what he described
as a fundamental point that the complaint made by Mr Robertson remained
unanswered.  
<P>

198   	However Mr Gageler submitted that the use of a
replacement cost depreciation and amortisation figure as a starting point
was
not unreasonable.  He submitted that indexed historical costs are still
"costs", sometimes referred to as current costs. He submitted
that although Mr
Robertson had criticised the use of the inflated cost he acknowledged that the
concept of "current costs" was a
recognised accounting tool.  
<P>

199   	Adopting Mr Gageler's proposition in cross examination of
Mr Robertson that indexing is a well recognised accounting tool
seems to make
Mr Martin's point.  These costs were in fact the result of the utilisation of
an accounting tool not a cost incurred
in the construction of a road. 
<P>

200   	Mr Gageler relied upon the portion of the Second Reading
Speech in the Legislative Assembly in which Mr Causley said that
it was
anticipated that the Commission would determine the costs by reference to
standard commercial accounting practices.  I am
of the view that such a
statement of anticipation does not entitle the Commission to utilise accounting
tools to inflate costs that
were incurred as defined within s30E(2).  
<P>

201   	As I have said earlier I agree with the approach adopted
by the court in<i> </i><b>Allsands Pty Ltd v Shoalhaven City Council</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2029%20NSWLR%20596" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993)
29 NSWLR 596</a> at 607.  Certainly this allows the Commission to have regard to
accounting practices and in so doing requires the Commission to determine
the
costs which were incurred not the costs that were inflated after they were
incurred.  
<P>

202   	I conclude therefore that the first ground of complaint
in respect of the roading costs in this period is made out.  The
Commission has
misconstrued the requirements under the legislation. It has thus misdirected
itself in determining these particular
costs.  It has taken irrelevant matters,
the indexing of the costs, into account.
<P>

<u>Second complaint - Shire Road resumed in 1977</u>
<P>

203   	The second complaint made by the plaintiffs in respect of
these costs during this period is that the cost of 37.5 kilometres
of the Shire
Road was included in the roading costs.  The claim the plaintiffs make is that
the cost of this portion of the road
should not have been included because it
was transferred to the Shire in 1977.  
<P>

204   	This complaint depends upon a finding of fact in respect
of whether the Shire Road was transferred to the Gloucester Shire
in 1977.  The
defendant claims it was not transferred to the Shire and that only its
maintenance was taken over by the Shire and
therefore it was an appropriate
cost to be included in the roading costs.  
<P>

205   	The plaintiffs relied upon a letter from their solicitor
to the senior legal officer of the defendant dated 27 March 1995
and a response
to that letter dated 28 July 1995.  (annexures SS and VV respectively to the
affidavit of Christine Mary Pollitt of
12 April 1996)  The question posed was
as follows:
<P>

<i>In relation to the Barrington Tops Road east of the eastern boundary of the
State Forest:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	please confirm that this road was handed over to the Gloucester Shire
Council in 1977 and has been fully maintained by it since
that time.</i>
<P>

The answer to that question was as follows:
<P>

<i>This section of the Barrington Tops Road was constructed by State Forest and
resumed by Gloucester Shire in 1977.  Essentially all
maintenance since that
date has been council's responsibility.</i>
<P>

206   	The plaintiffs emphasised the use of the word "resumed".
The plaintiffs submit that resumption of the road meant that the
construction
costs of this portion of the road could no longer be taken into account.
<P>

207   	The defendant submitted that I would be satisfied on the
evidence that what really happened in 1977 was that the defendant
retained
ownership of that portion of the road but that the Gloucester Shire Council
merely took over the maintenance of that portion
of the road.  The evidence
relied upon by the defendant is an answer to interrogatory 15 (ex D) and a
statement made in the Commission's
Management Plan for Gloucester Management
Area 1984 (ex. E).
<P>

208   	The question posed and answer given in the interrogatory
is as follows:
<P>

<i>15A	Please confirm:</i>
<P>

<i>The original cost of the construction of this road was $289,612, that it was
constructed in 1971 - 1972 and that it was handed over
to the Gloucester Shire
Council in 1977 and has been fully maintained by Gloucester Shire Council since
that time (letter from State
Forest to us dated 28 July 1985).</i>
<P>

<i>15B	Partly incorrect.  The original cost was $257,821 over the period
1967/68 to 1971/72 and the maintenance was handed over to the
Gloucester Shire
Council in 1977 which has maintained the road since then.  </i>
<P>

209   	The statement in the Management Plan appears at p18 under
the heading Forest Management General.  It is as follows:
<P>

<i>Upon completion of the Barrington Tops Road in 1978, that part of the area
west of the Mount Royal Ranger and formerly within Muswellbrook
District
administration was transferred to Gloucester.</i>
<P>

210   	This point was made at the commencement of the hearing in
the plaintiffs' outline of the claims to be made in the proceedings.
 None of
the witnesses called by the defendant were asked about this particular matter,
there is no other documentary material to
evidence the status of that portion
of the road. Mr Martin submitted that in the circumstances the rule in <b>Jones
v Dunkel</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1959/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1959] HCA 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281959%29%20101%20CLR%20298" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1959) 101 CLR 298</a> should be applied  in the plaintiffs' favour in
my finding on this aspect of the matter.
<P>

211   	I disagree. Although the defendant used the word
"resumed" in its letter of 28 July 1995 such word was not adopted in the
interrogatory.  Certainly the interrogator referred to the letter in which the
word "resumed" was used but adopted the words "handed
over".
<P>

212   	The two relevant questions raised in the interrogatory
were (1) please confirm that it was handed over to the Gloucester
Shire Council
in 1977; and (2) please confirm that it has been fully maintained by the
Gloucester Shire Council since that date.
These questions were answered (1) the
maintenance was handed over to the Gloucester Shire Council in 1977 and (2) it
has maintained
the road since then. I am satisfied that on this evidence that
this portion of the road was not resumed.
<P>

213   	The second claim in respect of roading costs made by the
plaintiffs fails.
<P>

<u>Third complaint - roads constructed for different purposes</u>
<P>

214   	The third complaint made by the plaintiffs in respect of
roading costs in this period is that the Commission took into account
the whole
of the costs of the construction of the permanent roads (Shire Road, Barrington
Tops Forest Road, Dilgry Circle Road, Thunderbolts
Road and Gummi Road)
although those roads had been constructed for purposes other than in connection
with those set out in s30E(2)(b)
and (c). These roads are located close to each
other and are depicted in the maps of the area.(Ex B) 
<P>

215   	The plaintiffs rely upon statements within the
defendant's 1984 Management Plan for the Gloucester Management Area to support
the submission in relation to the purpose of the construction of these
permanent roads.  The statements relied upon indicate that
the Barrington Tops
Road was a road of high standard because it had to cope with pressure of
harvesting, recreational and administrative
traffic, particularly during the
extremes of weather experienced in the high plateau areas (par 1.3.1.1 Ex
E).
<P>

216   	The report also referred to the fact that the Barrington
Tops Forest Road represented the service link between the Manning
and Hunter
Valleys and consequently provided ready access to the State Forest areas for
roadside rests.  (1.6.3 Ex. E)  It referred
to the variety of uses such as
bushwalking, bike riding, 4WD motoring, picnicking, camping, swimming and
fishing.  (1.6.3 Ex. E)
<P>

217   	The report also detailed the settlement of both the Upper
Hunter and Upper Manning area.  It referred to the establishment
of a busy
township in the Gloucester area, extensive agricultural development and the
completion of the Barrington Tops Road finally
linking the Hunter and Manning
valleys "giving a boost to the Tourist and Timber industries".  (1.7.1.3 p 49
Ex. E)  
<P>

218   	There was also reference in the report to the "Barrington
Club" when the area was used for limited recreation, mainly horse
riding and
fishing.  It was said that the Barrington Club consisted of "prominent citizens
of Newcastle" who established a hut and
used the Barrington Tops primarily for
trout fishing.  There was further reference to the other clubs such as the
Newcastle Trades
Hall and Working Club and the Newcastle Technical College
Bushwalking Club which had traditionally used the areas for recreation
since
the early 1950's.  (1.7.1.5(v) Ex. E)  There is also reference in the report to
scientific research being carried out in the
area.
<P>

219   	Annexure B to the affidavit of Edward Robert Bromley of
24 February 1999, the plaintiffs' father, is a brochure produced
by the
defendant in which the forest areas of the Barrington Tops are advertised with
a map and description including that "recreation
activities on State Forests is
encouraged and some tables, fireplaces and camping sites have been set aside
for your use".  It claims
"<u>ALL</u> roads are public roads".
<P>

220   	John Graham Reynolds, a sales manager employed by the
defendant, also gave evidence that the Barrington Tops Road links the
Hunter
Valley and the Manning Valley. He said it conveys private and commercial
traffic east/west from Gloucester to Scone and west
to Taree. He agreed that
each of the roads, Barrington Tops Road, Dilgry Circle Road, Thunderbolts Road
and Gummi Road were used
by the public for recreational or private purposes. It
is clear from the evidence that this would also be the case with the Shire
Road
and that it would be used for commercial purposes as well.
<P>

221   	The plaintiffs submitted that the actual use to which an
asset is put subsequently can be evidence of the purpose of its
acquisition
(<b>Collector of Customs v Rottnest Island Authority </b>at 189-191;  <b>Cowell
Electric Supply Co Ltd v Collector of Customs</b> at 11).  It is submitted that
in the circumstances of all of these uses I will be satisfied that the purpose
of construction was
other than in connection with those set out in s30E(2)(b)
and (c).
<P>

222   	I am satisfied that the construction of the Barrington
Tops Road as referred to in the Management Report included the purpose
of
harvesting the timber.  I am also satisfied that it was constructed for other
purpose including the use by the public as a link
between the Manning and
Hunter Valleys.  I am also satisfied that the other permanent roads referred to
were constructed for purposes
other than harvesting including both recreational
and commercial uses.
<P>

223   	The fact that the construction of these roads had the
additional purpose of facilitating use, including recreational use
by the
public generally and commercial use linking of the two valleys, was not taken
into account by an appropriate apportionment
when determining these costs.
<P>

224   	I am of the view that the Commission failed to take these
relevant matters into account and misconstrued the requirements
of the
legislation in determining these particular costs. I am also of the view that
such a determination without an apportionment
was so unreasonable that no
reasonable person could have made it. The third ground of complaint made by the
plaintiffs is therefore
made out.
<P>

<u>Fourth complaint - roads used for other purposes</u>
<P>

225   	The fourth complaint made by the plaintiffs in respect of
roading costs was that there had been no apportionment of costs
deducted when
the use to which the roads had been put are uses other than the harvesting of
timber from the plaintiffs' land.  The
evidence relied upon in relation to the
third complaint is relied upon in respect of this complaint.
<P>

226   	I make the same finding in respect of this complaint for
the same reasons as I made in respect of the third complaint.  Accordingly
the
fourth complaint made by the plaintiffs is made out.
<P>

<u>Fifth complaint - construction costs of roads to other leases</u>
<P>

227   	The fifth complaint was that the Commission took into
account the construction costs of all the roads in the Gloucester Accounting
Unit although some of the roads had been constructed and used for the transport
of timber from leases other than the leases in question.
<P>

228   	This determination although requiring the plaintiffs to
bear the burden of the costs of roads used by other lessees made
no provision
for the plaintiffs to share in the royalties for those other lessees. In any
event having regard to the interpretation
I have made of the section it is
clear that the Commission also misconstrued the requirements of the section and
misdirected itself
in determining these costs.
<P>

229   	In all the circumstances I am satisfied that it was
manifestly unreasonable for the Commission to include costs of the construction
of roads for the purpose of taking timber and products from leases other than
the plaintiffs' lease without an apportionment recognising
this fact.
<P>

<u>Sixth complaint - costs of fully depreciated roads</u>
<P>

230   	The sixth complaint in respect of roading costs during
this period made by the plaintiffs is that the multiplier used to
determine the
permanent road construction included the whole of the length of permanent roads
used to transport timber harvested
from the plaintiffs' lease notwithstanding
the fact that the Barrington Tops Forest Road within the Barrington Tops State
Forest,
the Dilgry Circle Road and Gummi Road Stage II had been fully
depreciated respectively by 30 June 1987, 30 June 1990 and 30 June
1991.   
<P>

231   	The defendant once again points to the accounting
practice adopted by it in determining these costs. It submitted that the
inclusion of these costs was a matter of detail that did not make the
determination unreasonable. Consistently with my previous rulings
and my
interpretation of the requirements of the section I am satisfied that this
determination involved a misconception of the requirements
of the section and
the taking into account of irrelevant matters.
<P>

232   	This claim made by the plaintiffs is made out.
<P>

<b>Protection Costs</b>
<P>

233   	The district protection cost was calculated on a rolling
five year average in order to even out unusual seasonal variations
in fire
fighting.  The index was then applied to the specific amount of sales
pertaining to the lease for the period in question
to determine the protection
costs.  It is apparent however that the Commission deducted "any non-applicable
protection costs not
related to the lease" (interrogatory 83B Ex. D).
<P>

234   	This statement that the Commission deducted any
non-applicable protection costs not related to the lease was not specifically
tested in the evidence.  There was evidence that during the period 1 January
1990 to 30 June 1991 little if any protection work was
done on the plaintiffs'
leases.  There was such work carried out on the plaintiffs' lease in the period
from 1 July to 30 December
1991.  
<P>

235   	The plaintiffs claim that the Commission's deduction of
these costs was inappropriate because it was not apportioned.  This
submission
seems to fly in the face of the answer to interrogatory which specifically
infers that non-applicable protection costs
"not related to the lease" were
deducted.  It is also clear that the Commission took the view that the
protection work carried out
in the district in respect of the timber benefited
all lessees in the area.  
<P>

236   	The only real issue in this particular aspect of the
matter is whether the indexing of the averaging of the costs under the
formula
utilised was one that would sit consistently with my interpretation of the
section.  I am of the view that it cannot having
regard to the interpretation I
have given to the section that the requirement is to deduct actual costs not
current or indexed costs.
 
<P>

237   	Accordingly I am of the view that the application of the
indexing process was a misconception of the requirements of the
section by the
Commission and the plaintiffs' claim in respect of the protection costs in this
period is made out and the taking
into account of irrelevant matters.
<P>

<b>Administration costs</b>
<P>

238   	The complaint made by the plaintiffs in respect of
administration costs during this period is that the whole of the defendant's
administration costs were deducted by apportioning them between landholders on
the basis of royalty payments.  It was submitted that
only those costs incurred
in connection with the taking of the timber should have been deducted.
<P>

239   	The defendant submitted that the only administration
costs that were deducted were those referable to marketing, growing
stock,
maintenance, protection and short life roads.  It submitted that the method of
calculation and apportionment of those costs
was reasonable and an appropriate
determination under s30E(3) of the Act.  
<P>

240   	It is apparent that the collection of papers relating to
the management accounts makes clear that the method of overhead
distribution
did not include all the overheads but only a proportion of the overheads which
related to marketing, growing stock,
maintenance, protection and short life
roads.  These particular items (item 5, 7, 8, 9 and 11 respectively) were then
allocated in
accordance with the method of overhead distribution referred to
within those working papers (Ex. 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8).  
<P>

241   	The defendant submits that the plaintiffs' criticism that
costs of non-forestry activities were included in the administration
cost is an
apparent misunderstanding of the way in which items 13, 14 and 15 were derived.
Certainly Mr Hunt was cross examined about
this process and he was of the view
that the denominator within the determination would cure any pooling of
overheads which included
overheads relating to non-forestry related matters.

<P>

242   	Although far from straightforward it seems to me that
notwithstanding the fact that the formula utilised for the purposes
of reaching
a figure for overheads contained a denominator, the evidence demonstrates that
the pooling of the overheads included
overheads for non-forestry related
activities.  Once that pool was toxified with the inclusion of those
non-forestry related activities
the denominator could not cure its inclusion.

<P>

243   	I am therefore of the view that the defendant's response
to the plaintiffs' criticism is inadequate.  I agree with the plaintiffs'
submission that in determining the overheads which included non-forestry
related overheads the Commission has misconstrued the requirements
under the
legislation and took into account irrelevant matters. The determination is
vulnerable to successful attack.
<P>

244   	I am of the view that the plaintiffs' complaint in
respect of administration costs is made out.
<P>

<b><u>Claims in respect of costs deducted in the period January 1992 to
December 1996</u></b>
<P>

245   	During this period the Forest Management Charge and the
Access Road Costs were deducted from the gross royalties received
in respect of
the plaintiff's leases to reach the figure for the net royalty.  The plaintiffs
were paid one-third (1/3) of the net
royalty.
<P>

<b>Forest Management Charge</b>
<P>

246   	The plaintiffs' claims in respect of the Forest
Management Charge are as follows;
<P>

1.	The charge calculated on a rule of thumb formula of 40% of gross royalty did
not relate to the actual costs incurred in relation
to the plaintiffs'
lease.
<P>

2.	The formula was based on State wide figures for 1990 and 1991 and not costs
relating to the plaintiffs' lease for those years
<P>

3.	The formula was based on the 1990 and 1991 costs which included deductions
which by reference to the claims in those years were
deductions that were not
permissible under the Act.
<P>

247   	In relation to each of these claims the defendant says
that the application of the formula was reasonable and represents
a reasonable
determination of costs under s30E(3).
<P>

248   	Having regard to the view I have already expressed in
respect of the approach adopted by Mr Mackowski and determined by the
Commission I am satisfied that the application of this percentage to the gross
royalties was a misconception of the requirements
under s30E and took into
account irrelevant matters.  I am also of the view that the determination was
so unreasonable that no reasonable
person in this position could have made it.
Accordingly the forest management charge is vulnerable to a successful
attack.
<P>

249   	Each of the plaintiffs' complaint in respect of the
Forest Management Charge is made out. 
<P>

<b>Road (access) Charge</b>
<P>

250   	The plaintiffs claims in relation to the Road (Access)
Costs are as follows; 
<P>

1.	The charge calculated by the application of a formula of 0.74% of gross
royalty per kilometre of roads used did not relate to
the actual costs incurred
to transport the timber from the plaintiffs' lease.  Additionally the
plaintiffs claim that the formula
was based on State wide figures for 1990 and
1991 and not costs relating to the plaintiffs' lease for those years.
<P>

2.	The access charge which continued at the rate of 0.37% per kilometre for the
Shire Road should not have been charged because
that road had been transferred
to the Gloucester Shire Council in 1977 and in any event much of its
construction costs had been fully
depreciated.
<P>

3.	The multiplier used to determine permanent road construction costs included
the whole of the length of permanent roads used to
transport timber harvested
from the plaintiffs' leases notwithstanding:
<P>

(i)	the whole of the construction costs of the Barrington Tops Forest Road
within Barrington Tops State Forest had been fully depreciated
by 30 June
1987;
<P>

(ii)	that the whole of the construction costs of the Dilgry Circle Road had
been fully depreciated by 30 June 1990;  and
<P>

(iii)	the whole of the construction costs of Gummi Road Stage II had been fully
depreciated by 30 June 1991.
<P>

251   	The defendant's answers to these claims are as to (1) it
claims that the formula was reasonably based on State wide figures
for 1990 to
1991 and represented a reasonable determination of costs; as to (2) it submits
that this matter does not effect the reasonableness
of the determination of the
costs; and as to (3) it submits the utilisation of the multiplier was
reasonable in its determination
pursuant to s30E(3) of the Act. 
<P>

252   	For the same reasons that I have given in respect of the
vulnerability to attack of the Forest Management Charge I am also
of the view
that the application of the 0.74% of gross royalty is also vulnerable to
successful attack.  This also applies to the
access charge relating to the
Shire Road but not for the reason that it was transferred to the Gloucester
Shire Council. 
<P>

253   	Consistently with my previous ruling I am also of the
view that the plaintiffs' complaint in respect of the multiplier on
the road
access charge is made out.
<P>

<b>Manifest unreasonableness</b>
<P>

254   	The plaintiffs make a further claim that the
determinations made by the defendant in the period 1992 to 1996 were manifestly
unreasonable because the costs deducted during that period were far greater and
out of all proportion to the costs deducted in 1990
and 1991.  
<P>

255   	Part of my findings in respect of the determinations in
this period depended upon an interpretation of s30E based on an understanding
that the legislation included as one of its purposes the compensation of the
lessee.  This was a persuasive factor in reaching the
conclusions that the
deductible costs incurred were the actual costs in connection with the
operations as they related specifically
to the plaintiffs' leases.  
<P>

256   	I am of the view that this part of the plaintiffs' claim
should be understood as an alternative claim.  If I am wrong in
my findings
that the determinations made by the Commission during this period resulted from
the errors of law to which I have referred,
the taking into account of
irrelevant matters and the manifest unreasonableness of the determinations I
would not be satisfied that
the basis of this alternative claim could be made
out by the plaintiffs.  
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

257   	The Bromley plaintiffs have failed to establish any
entitlement to compensation pursuant to special condition (n) of their
Crown
lease.
<P>

258   	The Bromley plaintiffs and Mr Sweetman have for the
reasons given established that the determinations of the Commission pursuant
to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/s30e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s30E(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/" class="autolink_findacts">Forestry Act 1916</a> as particularised, but for the claim in
relation to the Shire Road, should be set aside.
<P>

259   	In these circumstances the determinations made by the
Commission as particularised in the pleadings should be set aside and
an
account should be taken of all the royalties paid to the defendants in respect
of the plaintiffs' land during the period 1990
to 1996.  I shall refer the
matter for inquiry as to such amount and/or damages either to a Master of this
Division or alternatively
to a Referee under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fa1916139/index.html#p72" class="autolink_findacts">Part 72</a> should the parties agree
on the adoption of such a course. 
<P>

260   	The parties are to bring in short minutes reflecting
these findings and I will hear any application in respect of costs of
these
proceedings.
