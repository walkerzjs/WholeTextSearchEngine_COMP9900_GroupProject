<P>


<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>The proceedings</b>
<P>

1	Two summonses were filed in the Administrative Law Division of this court by
the plaintiff, in each case seeking orders quashing
or declaring void or
invalid the whole or parts of declarations made by the first defendant, the
Specialist Medical Review Council
(more shortly referred to in the legislation
as "the Review Council") (SMRC), under s.196W(5) of the Veterans' Entitlement
Act 1986
(Cth) (the VE Act), on review, of Statements of Principle (SoP) made
by the Repatriation Medical Authority (in the VE ACT also referred
to as "the
Authority") (RMA) under s.196B(2) of that Act and consequential orders by way
of injunction, or orders in the nature of
prohibition, mandamus or under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.65</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a> (NSW).  Declarations were sought both as to the
true construction and effect of ss.5AB(2), 196B(2), 196B(3), 196W(2), 196W(4)
of
the VE Act and, further, as to asserted errors of law said to be revealed in
the reasons of SMRC for making the declarations as it
did.  There are claims
for such other orders as may be necessary together with claims in each case for
costs.  By order of Dunford,
J., both matters were directed to be heard
together.  They involve common questions of law.  The facts giving rise to
those questions
were to a great extent, common and were not in dispute although
the legal effect of those facts and the legislation was hotly in
contest.  I
have taken the abbreviations used in this judgment from those used by the
parties in the submissions and argument.
<P>

<b>The parties</b>
<P>

2	The first summons, in proceedings in this court numbered 30133 of 1996,
concerned declarations made by the first defendant (SMRC)
on review of SoP Nos.
95 and 96 of 1994 of the second defendant (RMA).  The second summons numbered
30139 of 1996 concerned the declarations
made by the first defendant in respect
of SoP Nos. 245 and 246 and was initially directed only to that defendant, the
SMRC.  In the
upshot, although to those summonses those defendants appeared,
the conduct of the defence in both matters has been carried forward
by the
Repatriation Commission (the Commission), a body corporate charged with the
general administration of the VE Act which was
joined as a defendant in both
proceedings.  The Commission has assumed the role of active defendant in the
two proceedings, consistently
with the principles referred to in the
observations in <b>R. v. Australian Broadcasting Tribunal;  ex parte Hardiman
</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1980/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1980] HCA 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%20144%20CLR%2013" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 144 CLR 13</a> at 35-36.  Plainly, the Commission, a body, constituted
under earlier statutory regimes, which is continued under s.179 of the VE
Act,
whose functions are set out in s.180 and whose powers, in s.181 of the Act, is
an entirely appropriate defendant.  This is accepted
in both cases by the
plaintiff.
<P>

<b>Previous litigation</b>
<P>

3	The matters come before the Supreme Court in consequence of the unsuccessful
attempt by the plaintiff to have the questions raised
determined in the Federal
Court of Australia.  That court upheld an objection to competency brought by
the Commission.  In <b>Vietnam Veterans' Affairs Association of Australia New
South Wales Branch Inc. v. Cohen &amp; Ors</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1996/981.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] FCA 981</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2070%20FCR%20419" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 70 FCR 419</a>, Tamberlin, J.
held that the Administrative Divisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) did not
extend to the declarations here in
issue as they were legislative and not
administrative in nature so that the Federal Court had no jurisdiction under
that Act to review
them (p.431E).  His Honour further held that jurisdiction
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s39b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.39B</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a> was unavailable in the Federal Court as
neither the RMA nor the SMRC, as bodies corporate, were within the description
"an officer
of the Commonwealth" and the relevant acts and decisions were not
those of the individuals constituting those bodies (at 432-433).
 Nor could the
accrued jurisdiction support dealing with the matter in that court (434A).  The
parties have neither here nor elsewhere
sought to challenge that decision nor
are his Honour's reasons challenged.
<P>

<b>Jurisdiction</b>
<P>

4	Before me, both parties submitted that the Supreme Court had jurisdiction.  I
set out their various jurisdictional submissions:-
<P>

<b>Plaintiff's jurisdictional submissions</b>
<P>

	"1.	The court has the jurisdiction of the High Court under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.75(iii)</a> of The
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> (suits against the Commonwealth) invested by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s39.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.39(2)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act 1903</a> (Cth).  Alternatively, it is exercising its inherent
jurisdiction over corporations established by Commonwealth law.  As a result
of
Tamberlin, J's judgment, it is not divested by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/adra1977396/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.9</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/adra1977396/" class="autolink_findacts">Administrative
Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977</a> (Cth) nor is it a 'special federal matter'
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.6</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987</a> (Cth).
<P>

	2.	The Administrative Law Division is the proper division under Schedule H
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/joca1987427/index.html#p2" class="autolink_findacts">part 2</a> item 3:  'applications in respect of decisions of a public body under
any Commonwealth Act'."
<P>

<b>Defendants' jurisdictional submissions</b>
<P>

	"The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court derives from <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s39.html" class="autolink_findacts">s39(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary
Act 1903</a> (Cth).
<P>

	The inherent (State) jurisdiction of the Supreme Court has been removed by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s39.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.39(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act</a> and re-invested as federal jurisdiction.
<P>

	Each of the defendants may be described as a person being sued on behalf of
the Commonwealth within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.75(iii)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> see s.179;  s.196A;
s.196V - <b>Kirkland v. Repatriation Commission</b> (1923) 32 CLR.
<P>

	Section 9 of the ADJR Act does not affect the Supreme Court's jurisdiction
because the decisions of the SMRC are not decisions
to which s.9 of the ADJR
Act applies nor are they decisions given by an officer of the Commonwealth.
<P>

	Nor does <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/joca1987427/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.6</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/joca1987427/" class="autolink_findacts">Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987</a> (NSW)
require that this matter be transferred to the Federal Court.
<P>

	This matter is not a 'special federal matter' within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/joca1987427/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.3(1)</a> of the
jurisdiction of Court (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987 (Cth).
<P>

	Although the matter is now within the original jurisdiction of the Federal
Court by virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s39b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.39B(1A)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act 1903</a> (Cth), it is a matter in
respect of which the Supreme Court, apart from the Cross-Vesting Act, has
jurisdiction."
<P>

5	Although there is some difference between the submissions and some of the
matters asserted are debatable, it is not necessary
that such be explored.  The
submissions are to the same general effect.  I accept and hold that I have
jurisdiction.
<P>

<b>Standing and discretion</b>
<P>

6	Both active parties pressed upon me submissions that it was appropriate that
the questions at issue be determined.  Those submissions
are put on the basis
of the public interest.  Each would appear to have the appropriate standing to
raise these matters as each has
a sufficient concern with the operation of the
VE Act.  Indeed as already noted, the Commission is generally charged with the
administration
of that Act and in that sense may be regarded in that respect as
an emanation of the Commonwealth Government.  The RMA and SMRC have
plainly a
deep concern in having the matter of the litigation determined.
<P>

7	The plaintiff is recognised in respect of matters under the VE Act and has
been recognised in the Federal Court, as an appropriate
representative of a
substantial body of those persons to whom the benefits of the Act extend.  The
parties answer the tests for standing
or sufficient interest laid down by the
High Court in <b>Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association v. Minister
for Industrial Affairs (SA)</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20183%20CLR%20552" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 183 CLR 552</a> and in <b>Batemans Bay Local
Aboriginal Land Council &amp; Anor v. The Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund
Pty. Limited &amp; Anor</b>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1998/49.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) HCA 49</a> (6 August 1998).
<P>

8	The parties urged upon me that if error of law should be found as to the
critical test for the SMRC function in making the declarations
in question, a
declaration should be made.  I have regard particularly to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s63.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.63</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">75</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a>.  In my view there is not only the presence of a substantial
element of public interest in the litigation but also the requisite
extent of
particular and public interest in the outcome:  <b>McGarrigle v. Public Service
Board</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%201%20NSWLR%20292" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 1 NSWLR 292.</a>  It is plainly a matter of public importance that
the questions thrown up by this litigation be decided.  This court is a
convenient
forum.  The relevant decisions affect the rights of persons in New
South Wales.  The parties have no recourse to the Federal Court
to determine
these questions directly.  The proceedings were launched in 1996 and have been
awaiting a hearing here for a considerable
time.  Proceedings elsewhere would
be considerably delayed.  To recommence the proceedings would be greatly
inconvenient.  Entitlement
to statutory rights conferred upon ex-servicemen and
their dependants by the VE Act is being determined on the basis of the
challenged
SoPs.  Even if the questions here thrown up might be determined
elsewhere by a collateral challenge, a determination should not have
to await a
further appropriate occasion.
<P>

<b>The materials</b>
<P>

9	The summonses have been supported by evidence in affidavits by Mr. Timothy
Hocart McCombe, President of the plaintiff and various
annexures and exhibits.
The documentary material includes the relevant declarations and reasons for
decisions of the SMRC, the relevant
SoPs and communications, particularly
between the plaintiff and the SMRC, initiating the review process which
resulted in the declarations.
 There was also an affidavit by Mr. Douglas, the
registrar of SMRC.
<P>

10	I have read this evidence.  In addition, I was provided with material, which
I have considered, to be used as extraneous aids
to the construction of the
relevant provisions including extracts from recognised dictionaries (including
a dictionary of epidemiology),
an article by Sir Austin Bradford Hill, CBE,
DSC, FRCP (Hons.) FRS (Professor Emeritus of Medical Statistics, University of
London)
to illustrate the principles of epidemiology with respect to causation,
the relevant explanatory memorandum and extracts from Hansard
including what
was said in both Houses of Parliament on the Second Reading of the Bill and in
the House or Representatives on the
amendment.  There was no relevant objection
or challenge to any of this evidence or material.  Indeed, I was urged by all
to have
regard to it in the light of earlier legislation and the body of case
law on it as setting the context for the consideration of the
legislative
scheme and language (in accord with the modern purposive approach to
interpretation:  <b>CIC Insurance Limited v. Bankstown Football Club
Limited</b> (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408.)
<P>

<b>The Statements of Principles (SoPs)</b>
<P>

11	In proceedings No. 30139 of 1996, the evidence disclosed that on 21 June
1995, RMA determined SoP Nos. 245 and 246 of 1995 concerning
motor neuron
disease.  No. 245 relevantly reads:-
<P>

	"1.	Being of the view that there is sound medical-scientific evidence that
indicates that motor neuron disease and death from motor
neuron disease <b>can
be related to operational service</b> rendered by veterans, peacekeeping
service rendered by members of the Peacekeeping Forces and hazardous service
rendered by members
of the Forces, the Repatriation Medical Authority
determines, under subsection  196B(2) of the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986
(the
Act), that the factor that must as a minimum exist before it can be said
that a reasonable hypothesis has been raised connecting
motor neuron disease or
death from motor neuron disease with the circumstances of that service, is:-
<P>

	(a)	inability to obtain appropriate clinical management for motor neuron
disease.
<P>

	2.	Subject to clause 3 (below) the factor set out in paragraph 1(a) must be
related to any service rendered by a person.
<P>

	3.	The factor set out in paragraph 1(a) applies only where:-
<P>

	(a)	the person's motor neuron disease was contracted before a period, or part
of a period, of service to which the factor is related;
 and
<P>

	(b)	the relationship suggested between the motor neuron disease and the
particular service of a person is a relationship set out
in paragraph 8(1)(3),
9(1)(e), 70(5)(d) or 70(5A)(d) of the Act.
<P>

	..." (emphasis added)
<P>

12	SoP No. 246 differs materially in clause 1 only, which reads:-
<P>

	"1.	Being of the view that on the sound medical-scientific evidence available
to the Repatriation Medical Authority, <b>it is more probable than not</b> that
motor neuron disease and death from motor neuron disease <b>can be related
to</b> eligible war service (other than operational service) rendered by
veterans and defence service (other than hazardous service rendered
by members
of the Forces, the Repatriation Medical Authority determines, under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">subsection
196B(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/" class="autolink_findacts">Veteran's Entitlements Act 1986</a> (the Act), that the factor that
must exist before it can be said that, on the balance of probabilities, motor
neuron disease or death
from motor neuron disease is connected with the
circumstances of that service, is:-
<P>

	(a)	inability to obtain appropriate clinical management for motor neuron
disease.
<P>

	..."  (emphasis added)
<P>

13	SoP No. 245 relates to operational service, peacekeeping service and
hazardous service.   SoP No. 246 relates to eligible war
service and defence
service.  The difference between the way in which the relevant service is
related to the disease (see the emphasised
passages above) by reason of the
sound medical-scientific evidence referred to, is explained by the way in which
the provisions of
the VE Act differently treat the consequences of disabilities
and the relationship to the different types of service.  A similar
difference
occurs with SoPs 95 and 96.
<P>

14	The relevant portions of SoP 95 read:-
<P>

	"1.	Being of the view that there is sound medical-scientific evidence that
indicates that malignant neoplasm of the prostate and
death from malignant
neoplasm of the prostate can be related to operational service rendered by
veterans, peacekeeping service rendered
by members of Peacekeeping forces and
hazardous service rendered by members of the Forces, the Repatriation Medical
Authority determines,
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196B(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/" class="autolink_findacts">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986</a>,
that the facts that must as a minimum exist before it can be said that a
reasonable hypothesis has been raised connecting malignant
neoplasm of the
prostate or death from malignant neoplasm of the prostate with the
circumstances of that services, are:-
<P>

	(a)	being exposed to herbicides in Vietnam;  or

<b>The review process and the declarations</b>
<P>

16	By letter of 29 August 1995, a statutory review pursuant to s.196Y of the VE
Act was initiated in relation to SoP 245:-
<P>

	"The Vietnam Veterans Association, NSW Branch, wish to appeal to the
Specialist Medical Review Council the decision of the Repatriation
Medical
Authority not to (sic) included in the statement of principal number 245 of
1995;  the use of solvents as a cause of Motor
Neuron Disease.  We wish the
appeal to cover both the Reasonable Hypothesis and Reasonable Satisfaction onus
of proof."
<P>

17	Following that request by the plaintiff, a review was commenced by the SMRC.
The plaintiff was notified by letter from Professor
Alex Cohen, the convener of
the SMRC that the RMA would be asked to forward to the SMRC "all the materials
that they considered when
making their decisions".  The letter continued:-
<P>

	"If you have additional material which you believe the Repatriation Medical
Authority did not consider, you may provide it.  However,
the Specialist
Medical Review Council is restricted in its review to consider only the
material available to the Repatriation Medical
Authority at the time.
<P>

	Any new material would be forwarded to the Repatriation Medical Authority
after the conduct of the review.  The Authority would
be asked to consider
whether or not such additional material would warrant further investigation or
change in the current Statements
of Principles." 
<P>

18	On 26 October 1996, the SMRC made the relevant declarations the operative
portion of which reads:-
<P>

	"1.	The Specialist Medical Review Council ('the Review Council') established
pursuant to Part X1B of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/" class="autolink_findacts">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986</a> ('the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>'), having
reviewed the contents of the Statements of Principles numbered 245 and 246 of
the 1995 (sic) made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196B</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> by the Repatriation Medical
Authority ('RMA') established under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/index.html#p101a" class="autolink_findacts">Part X1A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, HEREBY DECLARES
<P>

	(a)	that it is of the view that the sound medical-scientific evidence
available to the RMA at the time it made the Statement of
Principles No. 245 of
1995 is insufficient to justify the making of an amendment to that Statement of
Principles;
<P>

	(b)	that it is of the view that the sound medical-scientific evidence
available to the RMA at the time it made the Statement of
Principles No. 246 of
1995 is insufficient to justify the making of an amendment to that Statement of
Principles;
<P>

	(c)	that it recommends however that the RMA further investigate exposure to
solvents as a possible factor for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">subsections 196B(2)</a> and
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">196B</a>(3) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, having regard to the reasons for decision of the Review
Council in its review of the above Statements of Principles, in the information
that was available to the RMA when it made those Statements together with any
further information which has since become available
to the RMA and which may
become available between the date of this Declaration and the completion by the
RMA of its investigation."

<P>

19	The effect of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this declaration is that the SMRC
rejected the submission that exposure to solvents should
be included in SoPs
245 and 246 on the state of the evidence as existing before the RMA.
<P>

20	It had treated the request as initiating the statutory process of review
applying to both SoPs on the topic (probably because
of the references to both
standards of proof, which appears to attempt to reflect the difference between
245 and 246 particularly
noted earlier).  It recited that it had obtained all
the available information from the RMA, received written submissions and heard
oral submissions in particular on the applicable criteria for assessing
causation currently applied in the field of epidemiology
from representatives
of the plaintiff.
<P>

21	By a separate document it provided extensive reasons for its conclusions.
In particular, it set out the following in paragraphs
37-49 of the reasons:-
<P>

	"37.	Statements of Principles provide, exclusively, the medical-scientific
element within a suggested chain of causation in a claim
for pension for an
injury, disease or death.  If the claimed injury, disease or death is of a kind
that is the subject of a Statement
of Principles, then, where <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s120.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.120(3)</a> applies,
a hypothesis will be reasonable for the purposes of that subsection only if the
Statement of Principles upholds that hypothesis.
<P>

	38.	Similarly, where <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s120.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.120(4)</a> applies instead, the Commission can be
reasonably satisfied that the injury, disease or death was war-caused or
defence-caused only
if the Statement of Principles relating to that kind of
injury, disease or death upholds the contention that the injury, disease
or
death, is, on the balance of probabilities, connected with the person's
service.
<P>

	39.	It is important to note that Statements of Principles made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196B(2)</a>
do not, of themselves, define a 'reasonable hypothesis'.  A 'reasonable
hypothesis' can only ever arise in the context of a claim
for pension and must
relate to the connection between the particular circumstances of the particular
person's service and his or
her injury, disease or death.
<P>

	40.	Neither the Repatriation Medical Authority nor the Specialist Medical
Review Council is concerned with the determination of
the cause of injury,
disease or death of a particular individual.  That evaluation must be made
subsequently in assessing the relevance
of a Statement of Principles to the
case of a particular claimant.
<P>

	41.	However, one or more factors contained within a Statement of Principles
must provide support for the medical-scientific link
that forms part of a
'reasonable hypothesis' when the Statement of Principles is relied upon to
uphold a suggested chain of causation
linking the particular circumstances of a
veteran's service to his or her injury, disease or death.  Therefore, the
factors that
are to be contained in a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196B(2)</a> Statement of Principles must be
such that it can be said, in relation to every person for whom a factor is
relevant and who has suffered
or contracted, or who has dies from, the relevant
kind of injury or disease, that a 'reasonable hypothesis' has been raised
connecting
that person's injury, disease or death with the circumstances of his
or her service.
<P>

	42.	The inclusion of a particular factor in a Statement of Principles
determined under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196B(2)</a> means that the Repatriation Medical Authority is
satisfied that there is sound medical-scientific evidence that indicates that
it
can be said, in the case of every person to whom the Statement of Principles
applies, that it would be a 'reasonable hypothesis'
that exposure of the person
to that factor made a contribution to that person's injury, disease or
death.
<P>

	43.	Similarly, for a Statement of Principles determined under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196B(3)</a>, the
inclusion of a particular factor in that Statement of Principles means that, on
the sound medical-scientific evidence available,
the Repatriation Medical
Authority is satisfied that it can be said in the case of every person to whom
that Statement of Principles
applies, it is more likely than not that exposure
of the person to that factor made a contribution to that person's injury,
disease
or death.
<P>

	44.	It was recognised that the Repatriation Medical Authority is required to
consider the medical and scientific merit and relevance
of any posited
connection based on current epidemiological criteria.  The Specialist Medical
Review Council did not believe that
this requires the slavish adoption of one
set of criteria such as those enunciated by Sir Austin Bradford Hill although
these are
of considerable value in overviewing the topic.  In this respect a
factor of high relevance derived from an animal model might clinch
the case for
causality or, alternatively, might be of sufficient weight to exclude it.  The
Specialist Medical Review Council is
required to evaluate the content of the
Statements of Principles using all of the information on causality available to
the Repatriation
Medical Authority at the time that it made its decisions.
<P>

	46.	This Review Council believes that a review of any Statement of Principles
must include a consideration of the whole of the
Statement of Principles even
though particular aspects of concern and the subjects of objection may only
relate to parts of that
whole.  To do otherwise would be to disregard the
effect of changing one factor without due regard to its influence on the total
substance of the Statement of Principles as it was originally determined.  This
does not necessarily mean that each and every aspect
of the Statement of
Principles must be examined and potentially modified, only that the Review
Council must clearly delineate and
sequestrate any area of change, having
regard to the impact on other aspects of the Statement of Principles.
<P>

	47.	The Review Council understood that the material available to the
Repatriation Medical Authority was that conveyed to the Review
Council for its
consideration in the review.  It was only on this basis that such a review
could be concluded, for science is ever
expanding in its questing and
documentation.  Allowance has been made in the legislation for new, cogent
findings, which might alter
outcomes, to be relayed to the Authority for its
proper evaluation and response.
<P>

	48.	Having said this however, the Review Council was of the opinion that the
material studied by the Authority in coming to its
Statements of Principles was
the most relevant and informative.  None of the Review Council members was able
to suggest important
material extant at the time of the conclusion of the
Statements of Principles which had not been included, nor did any of the
witnesses
advance evidence for such material which would have altered the
outcome of our review.  The Review Council found that the material
that was
available to the Repatriation Medical Authority covered the most commonly
postulated causes of motor neuron disease and
included all of the theoretical
possibilities which have been advanced."
<P>

22	The reasons generally followed the format and as to general matters, the
reasoning SMRC had utilised in the first of its reviews
under the legislation,
ie., the reasons for decision given in reviewing SoPs 95 and 96 of 1995
concerning prostate cancer.
<P>

23	In those SoPs (No. 95 and 96 of 1995) appears the following:-
<P>

	"Thus, neither the Repatriation Medical Authority nor the Council is concerned
with determining whether or not, as a general proposition,
it is a 'reasonable
hypothesis' that a particular factor can cause a particular kind of injury,
disease or death.  However, one or
more factors contained within a Statement of
Principles must provide support for the medical-scientific link that forms part
of a
'reasonable hypothesis' when the Statement of Principles is relied upon to
uphold a suggested chain of causation linking the particular
circumstances of a
veteran's service to his or her injury, disease or death.  Therefore, the
factors that are to be contained in
a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196B(2)</a> Statement of Principles must be
such that it can be said, in relation to every person for whom a factor is
relevant and who has suffered
or contracted, or who has died from, the relevant
kind of injury or disease, that a 'reasonable hypothesis' has been raised
connecting
that person's injury, disease or death with the circumstances of his
or her service.
<P>

	The inclusion of a particular factor in a Statement of Principles determined
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196B(2)</a> means that the Repatriation Medical Authority is satisfied that
there is sound medical-scientific evidence that indicates that it
can be said,
in the case of every person to whom the Statement of Principles is intended to
apply, that it would be a 'reasonable
hypothesis ' that exposure of the person
to that factor made a contribution to that person's injury, disease or
death.
<P>

	Similarly, for a Statement of Principles determined under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196B(3)</a>, the
inclusion of a particular factor in that Statement of Principles means that, on
the sound medical-scientific evidence available,
the Repatriation Medical
Authority is satisfied that it can be said in the case of every person to whom
that Statement of Principles
is intended to apply, that it is more likely than
not that exposure of the person to that factor made a contribution to that
person's
injury, disease or death.
<P>

	Not only must the Authority and the Council make the assessments set out
above, but they must determine whether a suggested factor
can be related to the
relevant types of service.  There are some factors that could not be said to be
related to service.  For example,
being of the male gender is certainly a
relevant factor in the cause of certain diseases but it is difficult to see how
it can be
related to service."
<P>

24	The declarations relevant to those SoPs were made on 22 December 1995.  They
read:-
<P>

	"1.	In relation to the Repatriation Medical Authority Statement of Principles,
Instrument No. 95 of 1995 concerning malignant neoplasm
of the prostate and
death from malignant neoplasm of the prostate, made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196B(2)</a> of the

Council (the Council) declares, under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196w.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196W(5)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, that:-
<P>

	(a)	the Council is of the view that there is insufficient sound
medical-scientific evidence to justify the making of that Statement
of
Principles to include, as a factor, 'being exposed to herbicides in Vietnam';
and
<P>

	(b)	the Council recommends that the Repatriation Medical Authority reconsider
the inclusion of 'being exposed to herbicides in
Vietnam' as a factor having
regard to the Reasons for Decisions of the Council, the information that was
available to the Repatriation
Medical Authority when it made that Statement of
Principles, together with any further information that may arise from any
further
studies that might be undertaken following the recommendation in the
MacLennan and Smith Report relating to malignant neoplasm of
the prostate;
and
<P>

	(c)	the Council is of the view that there is no sound medical-scientific
evidence that justifies any other amendment of that Statement
of Principles.
<P>

	2.	In relation to the Repatriation Medical Authority Statement of Principles,
Instrument No. 96 of 1995 concerning malignant neoplasm
of the prostate and
death from malignant neoplasm of the prostate, made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196B(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>,
the Council declares, under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196w.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196W(5)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, that the Council is of the
view that there is no sound medical-scientific evidence that justifies an
amendment of that Statement
of Principles."
<P>

25	Thus so far as SoP 95 was concerned, it appears, the SMRC for itself would
have rejected the inclusion of exposure to herbicides
in Vietnam in the SoP.
However, it did not direct an amendment, remit for reconsideration or otherwise
purport to comply with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196w.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196W(4)</a> purporting to rely on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196w.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196W(5)(b).</a>  It was
not, however, sought that the inclusion of that factor in the SoP be
re-examined by the application for review.  Thus the
issue was raised
(plaintiff's Issue No. 11) of whether it was open to SMRC to propose deletions
from an SoP and whether SMRC had
to consider information additional to that
before RMA and if so, how.  It will be necessary to consider these questions
both in the
light of the determination of the proper interpretation of the
statute and it relates to these questions and in the context of particular
facts established in the evidence as to the initiation and the events of the
relevant review.  It is convenient to do so before turning
to the more general
contentions of the parties on the wider constructional issue.
<P>

<b>Compliance with the Statute</b>
<P>

26	On the first of these questions, although the drafting of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196w.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196W(5)(b)</a> is
hardly apposite to what SMRC did in that s.96W(5) only authorises a
recommendation about a future investigation rather than a
reconsideration of
the inclusion of a factor and speaks about the making or amendment of an SoP
rather than the inclusion of a factor,
it would seem that SMRC relied on that
provision on which to base subparagraphs 1(a) and (b) of the declaration.  The
relevant provisions
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196w.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196W</a> are as follows:-

	(a)	there appears to be a new body of sound medical-scientific evidence in
respect of that kind of injury, disease or death that
has not been previously
considered by the Authority;  and
<P>

	(b)	that new body of evidence, together with the sound medical-scientific
evidence available to the Authority, could justify the
making of a Statement of
Principles, or an amendment of the Statement of Principles already determined,
in respect of that kind of
injury, disease or death;
<P>

	the Council must make a declaration in writing to that effect giving the
reasons for its decision and directing the Authority to
carry out any
investigation under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196B(7)</a> in respect of that kind of injury, disease or
death.  The Council may include in the declaration any recommendation or
direction
that the Council considers fit to make about the carrying out of the
investigation.
<P>

	(8)	If, after considering the matters referred to in paragraphs (6)(a), (b)
and (c), the Council is not of the view referred to
in subsection (7) in
respect of that kind of injury, disease or death, the council must make a
declaration in writing:-
<P>

	(a)	affirming the decision of the Authority not to carry out the
investigation;  and
<P>

	(b)	giving the reasons for its decision.
<P>

	The Council may include in the declaration any recommendation that it
considers fit to make about any future investigation that
the Authority may
carry out in respect of that kind of injury, disease or death."
<P>

28	Despite the third defendant's submissions and having regard to the
distinction apparent between a factor in an SoP and the SoP
itself <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s.196B</a>
illustrates this), the statutory provision does not in its terms justify the
declaration as made, ie., that the SoP should not include
a particular factor
or that the SMRC could merely recommend that the RMA should reconsider the
inclusion of a particular factor.
 Rather than deal with factors, the provision
deals with the making or amendment of SoP relating to a particular kind of
injury,
disease or death.  The finding of lack of justification for the making
or amendment which is necessary under the statute, are absent.
<P>

29	Further, a real problem arises in the particular process of review and the
width of the enquiry undertaken by the SMRC.
<P>

<b>Lack of adequate notice</b>
<P>

30	In the reasons accompanying those declarations, SMRC recited the events of
the making of the SoPs and the applications by the
plaintiff and the Australian
Veterans' and Defence Services Council initiating the review.  It recorded the
Gazettal of its intention
to carry out a review "of the information available
to the RMA about malignant neoplasm of the prostate ...", and invited
submissions.
The Gazettal notice itself is not before me.  I have taken the
ambit of the SMRC enquiry to be as notified in the recital which is
set out in
the reasons.  As there referred to, no such limit on the enquiry to be
undertaken on the review was notified as might
exclude the examination of
exposure to herbicides (specifically "Agent Orange") as affording a basis for
the raising of a reasonable
hypothesis which would indicate on sound
medical-scientific evidence a relationship to operational etc. service as was
set out by
the RMA in SoP No. 95 of 1995.  The requests for review purported
only to challenge the asserted failure "to include ... as a reasonable
hypothesis the use of tobacco products as causing prostate cancer" (Exhibit A).
Thus the SMRC, without specific notice, proceeded
on a review request of
limited ambit to undertake a far wider enquiry than requested and to undertake
a review of contents other
than those contents of which a review was sought.
<P>

31	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196zb.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 196ZB(1)</a> provides for a notice in the Gazette:-
<P>

	"(c)	stating that the Council intends to carry out a  review of the
information available to the Authority about that kind of injury,
disease or
death;  and
<P>

	(d)	inviting persons or organisations authorised under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196za.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196ZA(1)</a> to do so to
make written submissions to the Council."
<P>

32	There is nothing in the statutory regime which would negate a legitimate
expectation of adequate notice of the particular topic
of review such as would
enable the opportunity to take advantage of the entitlements provided by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196za.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196ZA</a> by providing a submission on those particular aspects of the contents
of an SoP or the information available to the RMA being considered
by the
SMRC.

prescribes the function of SMRC and the courses it might take on such a review.
The result of a review may drastically
affect (by dint of restricting the ambit
of an SoP) the statutory entitlements that may be afforded to those making
claims under

reads:-

	"196ZA(1)	If the Review Council is carrying out a review under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196w.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196W(2)</a>, any
person referred to in paragraph 196Y(1)(a) or (b), or an organisation referred
to in paragraph 196Y(1)(c), may make a submission
in writing to the Council
about any information that was available to the Repatriation Medical Authority
and is relevant to the review
('relevant information').
<P>

	(2)	A person having expertise in a field relevant to the investigation may
make a submission in writing to the Review Council on
any relevant information

<P>

	5.	A person or organisation may not be represented before the Review Council
by a legal practitioner.
<P>

	6.	In this section, a reference to a submission does not include a submission
on a legal matter."
<P>

37	It appears from the particularity of the drafting of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196y.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.196Y(1)</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196w.html" class="autolink_findacts">196W</a>(2)
that the request may only relate to the contents of an SoP or a decision not to
make one.  Both of those matters are, by those
subsections, related to a
particular kind of injury, disease or death but not directly to particular
factors which might found a
reasonable causal hypothesis connecting those
factors to such injury, disease or death.
<P>

38	The legislation requires that all the information as to the injury, disease
or death as was available to the RMA must be reviewed.
 The SMRC must consider
all information available to it not only that available to the RMA but
including new bodies of evidence to
comply with the necessary ambit of a review
which would enable the consideration of matters relevant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196y.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196Y(7)</a> and (8).
It was therefore within its legislative ambit for the SMRC to consider all
factors.  In this respect, it complied with its
general statutory duty and gave
notice which on its face accorded with the statutory duty to give notice.
However, it must have been
apparent that the applicants for review had no
expectation that wider considerations than had been intimated would be
canvassed.
<P>

39	The evidence before me was that the plaintiff was unaware until its
President attended a hearing convened to receive oral submissions,
that
exposure to herbicides was in question and in consequence the plaintiff was
deprived of any real opportunity to present submissions.
 This evidence
appeared in the affidavit of Mr. McCombe of 28 November 1996.  It was not
sought to cross-examine him.  It was not
suggested he had or the plaintiff had
failed to avail itself of any opportunity to be heard on the issue.  In the
affidavit of John
Robert Douglas, the Registrar of SMRC read without objection
and upon which he was not cross-examined is evidence that:-
<P>

	"4.	At the commencement of the public hearing the Convenor of the Council,
Professor Alex Cohen, stated that the Council would
carry out a review of the
entire contents of the Statements of Principles.  The review included the
matters raised by the plaintiff
and the Naval Association being the possible
link between smoking and prostate cancer and the possible link between exposure
to herbicides
and prostate cancer.  Professor Cohen said that the purpose of
the hearing was to allow submissions to be made to the Council on
the content
of the Statement of Principles.  Each of the organisations present at the
hearing then made submissions to the Council
(except the Returned and Services
League of Australia).  The organisations represented at the hearing were:-
<P>

	(a)	the Vietnam Veterans' Association of Australia New South Wales Branch (the
plaintiff);
<P>

	(b)	the Australian Veterans' and Defence Services Council (AVADS);
<P>

	(c)	the Naval Association of Australia;  and
<P>

	(d)	the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL).
<P>

	5.	At the conclusion of the submissions by the organisations present,
Professor Cohen stated that the Council would now carry out
its review of the
content of the Statements of Principles.
<P>

	...
<P>

	7. 	The submission made by the plaintiff to the Council on that day and
repeated in a written submission to the Council, included
a chapter entitled
'The role of chemicals in cigarette smoke, industrial chemicals, agricultural
chemicals, pesticides, cadmium,
and male sex hormones as precursors to prostate
cancer in Vietnam Veterans.  What role does synergism play?'.  This chapter of
the
plaintiff's submission made reference to Agent Orange and other chemicals.
Annexed hereto and marked "A" is a true copy of a part
of the plaintiff's
submission entitled 'Smoking and Prostate Cancer' prepared by the Toxic
Chemicals Consultancy of Total Environment
Centre Inc. including the said
chapter.  Annexure "A" comprises 18 pages and is numbered 3 to 20.
<P>

	..."
<P>

40	It is not clear to me that the deponent is saying that Professor Cohen
expressly stated the matters referred to in the second
sentence of paragraph
four.  Rather, it seems the deponent was speaking of those matters as implicit
in the announcement of the review
of the entire contents of the SoP.  The
drafting of this sentence is to be contrasted with that where the deponent
refers to Professor
Cohen stating matters and where an express statement is
clearly referred to.
<P>

41	The submission of the plaintiff made mention of "Agent Orange" only in the
context of dioxin contaminates of it and deals with
it and other herbicides
only insofar as they might reasonably be expected to act synergistically with
chemicals in cigarette smoke,
ie., it refers to Agent Orange entirely
incidentally to the references to smoking and in a most minor way.  The Naval
Association
of Australia's written submission refers to exposure to herbicides
and pesticides during World War II, Korea, Malaya and Borneo in
a most general
fashion and to exposure only on those occasions.  It does not refer to Vietnam.
In neither case is there the slightest
basis to support the proposition that at
least the plaintiff was sufficiently forewarned of the issue to have at that
time any real
opportunity to be heard on it nor is any other opportunity to be
heard suggested in the evidence.  Indeed, Mr. Douglas deposed that
at the
conclusion of the oral hearing the Convener stated that the Council would now
carry out its review by which I take it that
the Convener was to be and was
understood as declaring the conclusion of the opportunity to make submissions.
Notwithstanding Mr.
Douglas refers to the plaintiff's oral submission of 7
November 1995 being "repeated" in the written submission, since Mr. McCombe
gave evidence the written submission was made to the Council on 19 July 1995, I
regard Mr. Douglas' evidence on the point as merely
establishing the content of
the two was to the same effect, not that the written submission was subsequent
to notice of the herbicide
issue.  The contents of the written submissions
speaks against any other conclusion.
<P>

42	The plaintiff, however, did not raise any protest or complaint.  I accept
the evidence of Mr. McCombe as to the reasons for that.
 There was little, if
anything, he could then do.  I conclude that in line with the authorities
dealing with constructive failure
to afford an opportunity to be heard for
reasons such as the wrongful refusal of an adjournment and particularly those
dealing with
the necessity to afford procedural fairness before continuing a
hearing initiated by a party which might unexpectedly produce a result
open
under the legislation but adverse to the moving party:  <b>Neal v. The
Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/55.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 55</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20305" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR 305</a>, that there has been a lack of observance of the
requirements of natural justice such, as would be necessary to permit a party
to
be properly heard, consistent with the opportunity statutorily provided by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196za.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196ZA.</a>  (See <b>Murray v.

NSWCA 70.)</a>
<P>

43	Although the matter in question has not been reconsidered nor the SoP
amended, if the plaintiff wishes, it should have the opportunity
to be heard.
The declaration involved in proceedings No. 30133 of 1996 may need to be
remitted to SMRC to consider it anew, for that
reason, if none other, so that
SMRC may consider the making of an appropriate declaration.  Notwithstanding
that the Commission submissions
at paragraph 29(c) and (d) suggest the
contested portions of the declaration have not been operating, it might have
been appropriate
to make some order.  Leaving the question of appropriate
relief for the moment, I turn from this specific matter to the submissions
on
the ambit of review generally. 
<P>

<b>Ambit of a review</b>
<P>

44	On a review by way of reconsideration as on the original review, the whole
of the information available to the RMA in respect
of that kind of injury,
disease or death is to be reviewed <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196w.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s.196W(2)).</a>  On such a review, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196w.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196W(2)</a>,
(4) and (6) contemplate that SMRC will consider information not considered by
RMA if it is as to sound medical scientific evidence
which (at the time of the
making of the SoP) was available to the RMA <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196w.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s.196W(2)</a> and (5)(a))  (whether
before it or not) or on which it could have relied <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196w.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s.196W(4))</a> and such
information as might point to the appearance of a new body of sound
medical-scientific evidence as might cause SMRC to act
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196w.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196W(7)</a> and
(8).
<P>

45	Otherwise, the function of SMRC was and will be as the Commission
submitted:-
<P>

	"25 ... to review the information before the RMA when it made the SoPs to
determine whether the contents of the SoPs reflect the
sound medical-scientific
evidence contained in that information;  it could receive new material that
explained, analysed or commented
upon the information before the RMA;  and it
could submit any new information, not before the RMA when it made its SoPs, to
the RMA
for consideration by the RMA."
<P>

46	It was further submitted:-
<P>

	"26.	...
<P>

	(a)	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196w.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 196W(2)</a> obliges the SMRC to 'carry out a review of all the
information that was available to the [RMA] when it ... determined ... the
SoP'.
<P>

	(b)	That obligation is complemented by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196k.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196K</a>, which requires the RMA to
forward to the SMRC 'a copy of all the information that was available to it
when it ... determined ...
the SoP'.
<P>

	(c)	According to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196za.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196ZA(1)</a> and (2),  the submissions that may be made to the
SMRC are submissions 'about any information that was available to the [RMA] and
is relevant to the review'.  The contrast with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196f.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196F(1)</a> and (2) is telling.
Those subsections provide for submissions to the RMA 'on any matter ...
relevant to the investigation'.
<P>

	(d)	The intention of the VE <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, that the SMRC conduct its review of an SoP by
reference to the material that was available to the RMA when it determined the
SoP,
is supported by the Explanatory Memorandum to the part of the Bill that
introduced the SMRC [Senate, Debates, 28 June 1994, p.2177],
as quoted at p.17
of the SMRC's reasons.
<P>

	It must also be remembered that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196B(7)(b)</a> gives the RMA the power, at any
time, to initiate a review of an SoP - so that new information can form the
basis of the RMA's review
of a SoP at any time.
<P>

	(e)	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196w.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 196W(7)</a> tells the SMRC how to deal with 'a new body of sound
medical-scientific evidence ... that has not been previously considered by the
[RMA]':  it must direct the RMA to carry out a new investigation into the
relevant kind of injury, disease or death."
<P>

47	Thus, it is clearly contemplated by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> that SMRC will consider new
information but only in the sense described and in the way and for the purposes
set out.
<P>

48	I do not accept the submission that SMRC is limited to considering the
information that was considered by RMA.  In my view, the
information the SMRC
is to consider is all the information available (in the sense of extant in the
discipline) to the RMA (whether
actually provided to it or not) in respect to
(these are words of great width) the particular injury, disease or death.  The
SMRC
fell into error in restricting the meaning of the word available as it
did.  It restricted the wide ambit naturally inherent in the
concept of a
review.  Clearly when the statute requires a review of a full scientific
investigation and an expert scientific review
of all the available material it
conceives of a process in that review wider than a simple re-examination of
what was actually originally
considered unless it should happen that what was
originally considered was all that was available.  The distinction between a
requirement
to consider information made available to it and a requirement that
to consider all the information was available is manifest.  On
such a review,
SMRC will have in mind the purpose under the statute of an SoP and the role in
the SoP of the sound medical scientific
evidence the existence of which it or
the RMA detects, ie. it will examine the extant information in the discipline
which might bear
on the particular injury, disease or death and apply to that
information the statutory criteria set out in the definition of sound
medical-legal evidence.  Any extant information about or concerning a factor
which might throw light on the circumstances of the
occurrence of those matters
will need to be considered if the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> is to be properly applied.
<P>

49	I do not see what the SMRC did by way of consideration of information was,
other than in the respects I have already mentioned,
out of accord with the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>
albeit, and not surprisingly considering the complex drafting, the expression
of the SMRC views in the reasons does not precisely
correspond with the
statute's expressed requirements.
<P>

<b>The general issues</b>
<P>

50	The plaintiff and the Commission have both relied on careful, extensive
written submissions which have been most helpful.  The
plaintiff in its written
submissions put the issues thus:-
<P>

<b>	</b>"2.	Both proceedings raise for the first time in any court the
interpretation of s.5AB(2) of the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986 (Cth),
which
is important to a system of 'Statements of Principles' (SoPs) introduced in
1994 (Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures)
Legislation Amendment Act
1994 (Cth)) to assist decision-making on entitlement to pensions for war-caused
injury, disease or death.
<P>

	...
<P>

	6.	The Act expressly limits to 'sound medical-scientific evidence', as defined
in s.5AB(2), the material upon which the RMA and
SMRC may form a judgment on
whether factors should be included in a SoP (see ss.196B(2), (3), (5), (6),
196C(3) and s.196W(4), (5)
<P>

	7.	The critical question raised in these proceedings is whether the terms of
the definition require evidence concerning an hypothesised
causal factor to
satisfy a scientific test of causation before it can be received as 'sound
medical-scientific evidence'.
<P>

	8.	If the definition has this meaning, then scientific evidence, raising a
reasonable hypothesis but falling short of <b>scientific proof</b> that a
factor is generally causative of a disease, can never be 'sound
medical-scientific evidence'.  The RMA and SMRC are unable
to consider whether
to make a SoP which includes that factor.  A claim for pension based on such an
hypothesis can never be upheld
by a SoP.
<P>

	9.	This is the effect of the construction adopted in the reasoning of the SMRC
in the two present proceedings and, the plaintiff
understands, currently
advised by the Repatriation Commission and applied by the RMA and SMRC.  The
plaintiff contends that it misconceives
the language and object of the amending
legislation.
<P>

	10.	The plaintiff contents that the adoption of this construction by the SMRC
invalidated the declarations under s.196W(5) which
are challenged in each
proceeding."
<P>

51	The defendants put the matter in paragraph 15 of their submissions:-
<P>

	"The SMRC was asked, under s.196Y of the VE Act, to review the contents of
four SoPs - Nos 95 and 96 of 1995 concerning Malignant
Neoplasm of the Prostate
and Nos 245 and 246 concerning Motor Neuron Disease.  The plaintiff attacks
each of those declarations.
 The attack is made on the following grounds:-
<P>

	(a)	The SMRC's construction of the concept 'sound medical-scientific evidence'
as defined in s.5AB(2) of the VE Act - paragraphs
7-10 of the plaintiff's
written submissions."
<P>

52	In statements of issues provided by the parties to me at my behest, the
contentions were expressed as follows:-
<P>

	"Plaintiff's List of Issues
<P>

	Q1.	Does the definition in s.5AB(2) in its application to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196B(2)</a> and (3) of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/" class="autolink_findacts">Veterans Entitlements Act 1986</a> (Cth) require that evidence concerning an
hypothesised causal factor must establish a relevant causal connection as
probable to the
degree which would satisfy the science of epidemiology before
it can be treated as 'sound medical - scientific evidence'?
<P>

	A.	NO
<P>

	(i)	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s5ab.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 5AB(2)(b)</a> requires no more than that information satisfying
paragraph (a), and which is about how the injury, disease or death may be
caused,
should be relevant to and acceptable under the rules or methods of
epidemiology which are currently applied by experts in that field
when making
assessments of causation.
<P>

	(ii)	The definition of 'sound medical - scientific evidence" does not require
the information to establish any degree or standard
of proof of causation.
<P>

	(iii)	The definition of 'sound medical - scientific evidence' does not
indicate a causal relationship to be satisfied by the information.
<P>

	(iv)	On the issues arising under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196B(2)</a> and (3), the standards of proof to
be applied by the RMA and SMRC when drawing conclusions from 'sound medical -
scientific evidence'
are those provided by the terms of those subsections, ie.
whether in their expert opinions that evidence raises a reasonable hypothesis
of a relationship, and whether a relationship is more probable than not.
<P>

	(v)	The causal relationships to be considered are those described in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196B(14)</a>, and not the relationships applied in any field of science (if they
differ).
<P>

	Q2.	Do the reasons given by SMRC in each matter show that it applied the
correct construction of that definition?
<P>

	A.	NO
<P>

	..."
<P>

	"The defendant's response to plaintiff's list of issues
<P>

	A1.	No.  The sub-section does not require that evidence, to be used for the
purposes of sub-ss.196B(2) and (3), 'establish a relevant
causal connection as
probable' to any degree, whether within the science of epidemiology or
otherwise.
<P>

	The effect of sub-s.5AB(2) is that information about how a kind of injury,
disease or death may be caused can only be used by the
RMA for the purposes of
sub-ss.196B(2) and (3) if that information meets (in the sense of 'satisfies'
or 'conforms to;) the applicable
criteria currently applied in the field of
epidemiology for assessing causation.
<P>

	'Assessing causation' does not involve 'establishing a relevant causal
connection'.  It involves making a decision as to whether
the information
indicates or points to a causal connection.  The assessment calls for the
exercise of expert judgment, in selecting
the criteria which are applicable to
the relevant information, in measuring the information against those criteria
and in forming
a judgment on the question whether the information 'meets' the
criteria.
<P>

	The assessment will identify a pool of information from which the RMA (and the
SMRC) will then draw in order to make determinations
under sub-ss.196B(2) and
(3) - and other provisions in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196B.</a>
<P>

	In response to the numbered sub-paragraphs, the third defendant says:-
<P>

	(i)	This is not what para.5AB(2) provides.  The paragraph makes no reference
to the information being 'relevant to and acceptable
under the rules or
methodology of epidemiology ...'.  In short, the paragraph means what it
says.
<P>

	(ii)	If this proposition means that the definition does not require that the
information establish causation, the third defendant
agrees.
<P>

	(iii)	The third defendant agrees;  however, if the information is about how a
disease may be caused, the information must meet
the applicable criteria for
assessing causation.
<P>

	(iv)	The third defendant disagrees with this proposition.  The references to a
'reasonable hypothesis' and 'more probable than
not' define the type of SoP
that is to made, and guide the RMA and SMRC in the prescribing the factors to
be included in the SoPs.
<P>

	(v)	The causal relationships set out in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/s196b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.196B(14)</a> are irrelevant to the
assessment of information under para.5AB(2)(b).  They are relevant to the
making of a determination under 196B(2)
and (3).
<P>

	A2.	Yes.
<P>

	...
<P>

	On the principal question, declarations 1(a) and (b) in respect of SoP 95 of
1995 were authorised by para.196W(5)(b)."
<P>

53	I set out the relevant statutory provisions:-
<P>

	"5AB(1)	In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:-
<P>

	...
<P>

	'sound medical-scientific evidence', in relation to a particular kind of
injury, disease or death, has the meaning given by subsection
(2).
<P>

	5AB(2)	Information about a particular kind of injury, disease or death is
taken to be sound medical-scientific evidence if:-
<P>

	(a)	the information:-
<P>

	(i)	is consistent with material relating to medical science that has been
published in a medical or scientific publication and
has been, in the opinion
of the Repatriation Medical Authority, subjected to a peer review process;
or
<P>

	(ii)	in accordance with generally accepted medical practice, would serve as
the basis for the diagnosis and management of a medical
condition;  and
<P>

	(b)	in the case of information about how that kind of injury, disease or death
may be caused - meets the applicable criteria for
assessing causation currently
applied in the field of epidemiology.
<P>

	..."
<P>

54	Part XIA of the Act deals with the RMA.  It is established by s.196A, its
functions are set out in s.196B(2) and (3):-
<P>

	"<b>Determination of Statement of Principles</b>
<P>

	(2)	If the Authority is of the view that there is sound medical-scientific
evidence that indicates that a particular kind of injury,
disease or death can
be related to:-
<P>

	(a)	operational service rendered by veterans;  or
<P>

	(b)	peacekeeping service rendered by members of Peacekeeping Forces;  or
<P>

	(c)	hazardous service rendered by members of the Forces;
<P>

	the Authority must determine a Statement of Principles in respect of that kind
of injury, disease or death setting out:-
<P>

	(d)	the factors that must as a minimum exist; and
<P>

	(e)	which of those factors must be related to service rendered by a person;
<P>

	before it can be said that a reasonable hypothesis has been raised connecting
an injury, disease or death of that kind with the
circumstances of that
service.
<P>

	(3)	If the Authority is of the view that on the sound medical-scientific
evidence available it is more probable than not that a
particular kind of
injury, disease or death can be related to:-
<P>

	(a)	eligible war service (other than operation service) rendered by veterans;
or
<P>

	(b)	defence service (other than hazardous service) rendered by members of the
Forces;
<P>

	the Authority must determine a Statement of Principles in respect of that kind
of injury, disease or death setting out:-
<P>

	(c)	the factors that must exist;  and
<P>

	(d)	which of those factors must be related to service rendered by a person;
<P>

	before it can be said that, on the balance of probabilities, an injury,
disease or death of that kind is connected with the circumstances
of that
service."
<P>

55	Section 196B(4) relates to the making of an investigation by the RMA with a
view, inter alia, to the making of an SoP.  Section
196B(5) and (6)
provide:-
<P>

	"(5)	If, after carrying out the investigation, the Authority is of the view
that there is sound medical-scientific evidence on
which it can rely to
determine a Statement of Principles under subsection (2) or (3), in respect of
that kind of injury, disease
or death, the Authority must do so as soon as
practicable.
<P>

	(6)	If, after carrying out the investigation, the Authority is of the
view:-
<P>

	(a)	that there is no sound medical-scientific evidence on which it can rely to
determine a Statement of Principles under subsection
(2) or (3)in respect of
that kind of injury, disease or death;  or
<P>

	(b)	that the sound medical-scientific evidence on which it can rely is
insufficient to allow it to do so;
<P>

	the Authority must make a declaration in writing;
<P>

	(c)	stating that it does not propose to make a Statement of Principles;
and
<P>

	(d)	giving the reasons for its decision."
<P>

56	Section 196C expresses the powers of the RMA.  It provides:-
<P>

	"196C(3)	In forming any view during the investigation, the Authority:-
<P>

	(a)	may rely only on sound medical-scientific evidence:-
<P>

	(i)	that has been submitted to it;  or
<P>

	(ii)	that it has obtained on its own initiative or from the Secretary (under
subsection (2)) or from a consultant;  and
<P>

	(b)	must consider and evaluate all the evidence so made available.
<P>

	..."
<P>

57	I have, in dealing with the particular arguments earlier, referred to and
set out the relevant provisions relating to SMRC.
<P>

<b>Legislative history, case law and extrinsic materials</b>
<P>

58	There was little difference between the parties as to the context.  An
introduction to the background of the parties' contentions
as found in the
underlying legislative and case law history of the provisions is to be found
conveniently in the submissions filed
by the Commission, paragraphs 3-14
inclusive.  I set out the relevant portions:-
<P>

	"3.	The proceedings before the Supreme Court raise issues about the operation
of Parts XIA and XIB of the VE Act, which were added
to the VE Act with effect
from 1 June (Veterans' Affairs (Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Act 1994
(Cth)).
<P>

	4.	Section 13 of the VE Act makes the Commonwealth liable for the payment of
pensions to veterans for incapacity from war-caused
injury or disease and to
veterans' dependants for war-caused death.
<P>

	5.	Section 8 of the VE Act defines war-caused death;  and s.9 of the VE Act
defines war caused injury and disease.  The VE Act
prescribes the standards of
proof to be applied by decision-makers (The Repatriation Commission, the
Veterans' Review Board and the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal) in deciding
whether a particular injury, disease or death is war-caused.
<P>

	(a)	So far as veterans with operational service (Speaking generally,
operational service is service outside Australia during war-time,
or three
months service in the northern part of the Northern Territory between 13
February 1942 and 12 November 1943:  see s.6 of
the VE Act) are concerned,
s.120(1) of the VE Act directs the decision-maker to make a positive finding
unless it is satisfied beyond
reasonable doubt that the claimed injury, disease
or death is not war-caused.  That standard of proof dates from 1977 (see
<b>East v. Repatriation Commission</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1987/242.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] FCA 242</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2016%20FCR%20517" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 16 FCR 517</a> at 519-520).
<P>

	A 1985 amendment to the VE Act's predecessor (the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealed_act/ra1920155/" class="autolink_findacts">Repatriation Act 1920</a>) now
appears in s.120(3) of the VE Act.  The amendment requires decision-makers to
be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that an injury,
disease or death is not
war-caused if the decision-maker is of the opinion that the material before it
does not raise a reasonable
hypothesis connecting the claimed injury, disease
or death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the
veteran.
<P>

	The background to, and the purpose of, the 1985 amendments was explained by
the Full Court of the Federal Court in <b>East v. Repatriation Commission</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2016%20FCR%20417" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 16 FCR 417</a> at 521-524.  Essentially, the requirement that a reasonable
hypothesis be raised by the material overcomes the High Court's decision
in
<b>Repatriation Commission v. O'Brien</b>, and prevents a claim succeeding on
the ground that the cause of an injury, disease or death is unknown.  It is not
enough that a
connection between the injury, disease or death and war service
cannot be excluded or is 'left open' on the material;  rather, the
material
before the decision-maker must raise facts that positively 'point to' the
relevant connection (<b>East v. Repatriation Commission</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1987/242.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] FCA 242</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2016%20FCR%20517" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 16 FCR 517</a>
at 532-533;  <b>Repatriation Commission v. Bey</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1997/1347.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] FCA 1347</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20149%20ALR%20721" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 149 ALR 721</a> at
730).
<P>

	(b)	Where a claim for pension relates to a veteran with eligible war service
(again speaking generally, eligible war service is
service in Australia during
war-time, other than service in the northern part of the Northern Territory
during the relevant period:
 see s.7 of the VE Act), as distinct from
operational service, the decision-maker is required to apply the civil standard
of proof
when deciding whether the claimed injury, disease or death is
war-caused (s.120(4);  <b>Repatriation Commission v. Smith</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2015%20FCR%20327" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 15 FCR
327</a> at 335).
<P>

	6.	The 1985 amendments were re-cast when the VE Act was enacted in 1986
(<b>East v. Repatriation Commission</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1987/242.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] FCA 242</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2016%20FCR%20517" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 16 FCR 517</a> at 524-527).  They
have attracted significant litigation in the Federal Court, the most recent
exposition being by a five member
bench in <b>Repatriation Commission v.
Bey</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1997/1347.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] FCA 1347</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20149%20ALR%20721" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 149 ALR 721.</a>  The concept of the reasonable hypothesis in the VE
Act and its place in the decision-making process have also been considered by
the High Court on three occasions (<b>Bushell v. Repatriation Commission</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20408" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 408</a>;  <b>Byrnes v. Repatriation Commission</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/51.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 51</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20564" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR
564</a>;  <b>Repatriation Commission v. Owens</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2070%20ALJR%20904" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 70 ALJR 904).</a>
<P>

	<b>The 1994 amendments</b>
<P>

	7.	In 1994, the VE Act was further amended with the introduction of ss.120A
and 120B, Parts XIA and XIB and association provisions
(such as the definition
of 'sound medical-scientific evidence', in s.5AB(2) of the VE Act).  The
purpose of the amendments was expressed
in both the Second Reading Speech (SRS)
(House of Representatives, Debates, 9 June 1994, pp.1806-1807) and the
Explanatory Memorandum
(Ex Mem) on the Bill (the reasons of Lindgren, J. in
<b>Beale v. Administrative Appeals Tribunal </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2026%20AAR%20497" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 26 AAR 497</a> at 500-501
contain a concise summary of the extrinsic material).
<P>

	(a)	A substantial part of the problem to which the amendments were addressed
was identified in the Explanatory Memorandum (Ex Mem)
as the extension, by the
High Court's decisions, of the 'reasonable hypothesis' standard to the point
where the 1985 and 1986 amendments
'have been rendered largely ineffective'.
It was said that two government reports had pointed to problems in the
interpretation of
the that (sic) standard.
<P>

	(b)	The Ex Mem also identified a lack of consistency in decision-making,
largely because non-medical bodies were required to determine
medical-scientific issues which called for detailed technical knowledge.
<P>

	(c)	The SRS referred to the 'relaxed interpretation' of the 'reasonable
hypothesis' test, a 'lack of consistency in decision-making',
and the
'inappropriateness of laymen determining complex questions of medical
causation'.
<P>

	(d)	According to the SRS, the amendments were intended 'to ensure that the
credibility of the repatriation system is maintained
and that medical opinions
supported by little or no medical-scientific evidence do not prevail over the
carefully developed mass
of medical-scientific opinion'.
<P>

	(e)	The Ex Mem identified the purposes of the amendments - to ensure that
hypotheses are not found 'reasonable' unless 'based on
sound evidence from the
field of medical science';  to remove 'purely medical causation issues' from
delegates of the Repatriation
Commission or, at the review stage, lawyers and
lay persons;  and to make an expert medical authority, the Repatriation Medical
Authority
(RMA), the authority for resolution of technical medical-scientific
issues, so as to ensure consistency at all levels of the system.
<P>

	(f)	According to the SRS, the 'Bill will, in effect, define by reference to
... Statements of Principles the concept of "reasonably
hypothesis" as it
appears in s.120(3)' of the VE Act (House or Representatives, Debates, 9 June
1994, p.1808).
<P>

	(g)	To that end, the RMA was directed to make disallowable instruments, known
as Statements of Principles (SoPs) in respect of
particular kinds of injury,
disease or death 'that will exclusively state what factors must exist to
establish a causal connection
between particular diseases, injuries or death
and service' (Explanatory memorandum, p ii).
<P>

	(h)	Each SoP, as Heerey, J. put it in <b>Deledio v. Repatriation
Commission</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2025%20AAR%20396" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 25 AAR 396</a> at 411-412, was to prescribe a
medical-scientific standard with which a hypothesis must be consistent, a
template within which individual
claims would be determined, a statute-backed
declaration of what is proved or known scientific fact.
<P>

	8.	The objective of the 1985 amendments is achieved through the enactment of
ss.120A and 120B, which control the determination
of individual claims for
pension, and Part XIA, which establishes the RMA and charges it with the
responsibility of making and reviewing
SoPs.  (Part XIB, added as the amendment
Bill was being debated, provides a further level of review for SoPs.)
<P>

	(a)	Section 120A controls s.120(3) and, in general, precludes a hypothesis
being accepted as reasonable under s.120(3) unless the
hypothesis is upheld by
a SoP made by the RMA under ss. 196B(2) or (11) of the VE Act.
<P>

	(b)	Section 120B controls s.120(4) and, in general, precludes a decision in
favour of a claim relating to non-operational service
unless a SoP upholds the
contention that the claimed injury, disease or death is, on the balance of
probabilities, connected with
the veteran's service.
<P>

	<b>The SoP system</b>
<P>

	9.	The RMA is established by s.196A(1) of the VE Act.  Its members are
appointed by the Minister.  They must be medical practitioners
or medical
scientists with at least 10 years experience and (most significantly),
according to s.196L(3), at least one member must
be an experienced
epidemiologist.
<P>

	(a)	The responsibility of RMA, in making a SoP, is to prescribe, in
legislative form, the aetiology of each kind of injury, disease
or death -
thereby removing that issue from the matters that can be agitated before a
decision-maker.  The RMA and the Specialist
Medical Review Council (SMRC)
perform no decision-making function in relation to the facts of a particular
claim.  They perform a
legislative function (<b>Vietnam Veterans Association of
NSW v. Cohen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1996/981.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] FCA 981</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2070%20FCR%20419" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 70 FCR 419</a> at 427-431) by fixing the medical-scientific
standard with which a hypothesis must be consistent (<b>Deledio v. Repatriation
Commission</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2025%20AAR%20396" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 25 AAR 396</a> at 411;  endorsed by the Full Court in
<b>Repatriation Commission v. Deledio</b> (22 April 19980 at 20). 
<P>

	(b)	Where a claim relates to operational service, the role of the Commission,
the VRB and the AAT is to determine whether the hypothesis
said to connect the
injury, disease or death is upheld by the relevant SoP and is otherwise
reasonable (in the sense discussed in
<b>East v. Repatriation Commission</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1987/242.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] FCA 242</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2016%20FCR%20517" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 16 FCR 517</a> at 532-533;  and <b>Bushell v. Repatriation Commission</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20408" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 408</a> at 413-416);  and whether it is satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt that there is no sufficient ground for determining that the injury,
disease or death is war-caused.  The finding of facts in relation to a
particular claim remains a matter for the Commission, the
VRB and the AAT - but
a significant part of that fact-finding exercise is conducted within the
parameters set by the RMA in the relevant
SoP.
<P>

	10.	The nature and function of a SoP is expressed in ss.196B(2) and 196B(3) of
the VE Act.
<P>

	(a)	SoPs are made by the RMA in respect of particular kinds of injury, disease
or death after investigation under s.196B(4) of
the VE Act and are based on
'sound medical-scientific evidence' as defined in s.5AB(2) of the VE Act.
<P>

	(b)	Each SoP applies to a particular kind of injury, disease or death - it is
general in its application in the sense that it states
the minimum
medical-scientific component required for a connection with war service and
must be applied in relation to all claims
which involve that kind of injury,
disease or death.
<P>

	(i)	A SoP made under s.196B(2) of the VE Act sets out 'the factors that must
as a minimum exist, and which factors must be related
to service ... before it
can be said that a reasonable hypothesis is raised' connecting the relevant
kind of injury, disease or death
with the circumstances of service.
<P>

	(ii)	A SoP made under s.196B(3) of the VE Act sets out 'the factors that must
as a minimum exist, and which ... must be related
to service', before it can be
said that the relevant kind of injury, disease or death is probably connected
with the circumstances
of service (the standard of proof where the claim does
not relate to operational service, peacekeeping service or hazardous
service).
<P>

	(c)	The SoP is not personal to a particular veteran or applicant but
expresses, in legislative (and therefore definitive) terms,
current medical
knowledge as to the causation of particular kinds of injury, disease or
death.
<P>

	(d)	According to Tamberlin, J. in <b>Vietnam Veterans' Association v.
Cohen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1996/981.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] FCA 981</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2070%20FCR%20419" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 70 FCR 419</a> at 422, a SoP provides 'the medical-scientific
frame of reference' for a claim for pension under s.13 of the VE Act.
<P>

	As Heerey, J. put it in <b>Deledio v. Repatriation Commission</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2025%20AAR%20396" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 25
AAR 396</a> at 411-512, each SoP fixes, in the form of a template to be applied to
claims for pension, the medical-scientific standard with which
a hypothesis
(for the purpose of s.120A(3) of the VE Act) or a contention (for the purpose
of s.120B(3) of the VE Act) must be consistent.
<P>

	(e)	SoPs are legislative instruments.  They are binding on all
decision-makers, including the AAT (Explanatory Memorandum, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/va199495bmlab1994518/" class="autolink_findacts">Veterans' Affairs
(1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994</a>, pp.3-5;  <b>Vietnam

<P>

	For that reason, medical evidence presented to a decision-maker that (say)
prostate cancer can be caused by the smoking of cigarettes
would be irrelevant
to a claim for pension under s.13 of the VE Act, given the terms of SoP no. 95
of 1995.  Assuming that the claim
relates to operational service, a hypothesis
that the veteran's disease is connected to his war service through
service-related cigarette
smoking cannot be reasonable because that hypothesis
is not upheld by SoP No. 95 of 1995.
<P>

	As Heerey, J. observed in <b>Deledio v. Repatriation Commission</b>, 'unless
the hypothesis was consistent with [the factors prescribed in the SoP], there
would be no point in running the case'  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2025%20AAR%20396" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 25 AAR 396</a> at 411 - because the
SoP 'is a statute-backed declaration of what is proved or known scientific
fact'  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2025%20AAR%20396" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 25 AAR 396</a> at 412;  endorsed by the Full Court in <b>Repatriation
Commission v. Deledio</b> (22 April 1998) at 22.
<P>

	<b>RMA review of SoPs</b>
<P>

	11.	The RMA must (subject to the limited discretion in s.196C(4) of the VE
Act) review a SoP if requested to do so by the Commission,
a person eligible to
claim or an organisation representing those eligible to claim (such as the
plaintiff):  ss.196E(1), 196B(7)(a)
of the VE Act.
<P>

	The RMA is also required to review a SoP if it thinks there are grounds for
such a review;  or if it is so directed by the SMRC:
 ss.196B(7)(b) and
196B(7)(c) of the VE Act.
<P>

	12.	If the RMA reviews a SoP and forms the view that there is 'a new body of
sound medical-scientific evidence' that justifies
changing the SoP, it must
make a new SoP or amend the existing SoP:  s.196B(8) of the VE Act.  The RMA's
determination under s.196B(8)
is a disallowable instrument:  s.196D of the VE
Act.
<P>

	Alternatively, the RMA may make a declaration stating that it does not propose
to make a new SoP or amend an existing SoP:  s.196B(9)
of the VE Act.
<P>

	<b>SMRC review of SoPs</b>
<P>

	13.	Part XIB of the VE Act provides for a further possible review of the
contents of a SoP by the SMRC.  The SMRC is established
by s.196V(1) of the VE
Act.  According to s.196ZE, the SMRC's members are appointed by the Minister,
who is to have regard to the
relevant medical-scientific expertise required to
decide matters referred to the SMRC.  As with the RMA, members of the SMRC must
be medical practitioners or medical scientists with at least 10 years
experience:  s.196ZF.
<P>

	14.	Amongst the functions of the SMRC is the review of the contents of a
particular SoP, when so requested under s.196Y of the
VE Act by the
Repatriation Commission, a person eligible to make a claim or a veterans'
organisation.
<P>

	(a)	If the SMRC decides that there is sound medical-scientific evidence that
justifies amending the relevant SoP, the SMRC is to
<b>direct</b> the RMA to
amend the SoP or remit the matter to the RMA with directions or
recommendations:  ss.196W(4)(c) and (d) of the VE Act.
<P>

	Where the SMRC <b>directs</b> the RMA to amend the SoP, s.196B(1) of the VE
Act obliges the RMA to amend the SoP in accordance with the SMRC's
directions.
<P>

	(b)	Alternatively, the SMRC may <b>recommend</b> to the RMA that the RMA carry
out a further investigation in respect of the relevant kind of inquiry, disease
or death:  s.196W(5)
of the VE Act.
<P>

	It will be a matter for the RMA to decide under s.196B(7)(b) of the VE Act
whether to act on the recommendation.
<P>

	(c)	The SMRC may also <b>direct</b> the RMA to carry out a new investigation
into a particular kind of injury, disease or death if the SMRC finds that there
appears
to be new medical scientific evidence not previously considered by the
RMA:  s.196W(7) of the VE Act.
<P>

	Where the SMRC <b>directs</b> the RMA to carry out a new investigation into a
particular kind of injury, disease or death, s.196B(7)(c) of the VE Act obliges
the
RMA to carry out that investigation."
<P>

59	The plaintiff took little, if any issue, with this, setting out the
background in its written submissions thus:-
<P>

	"4.	Historically, veterans legislation has required that claims to pension
relating to operational war-service be decided according
to a standard of
satisfaction as to the facts which is less demanding than the civil standard of
proof [The history is explained
in <b>Deledio v. Repatriation Commission
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2025%20AAR%20396" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 25 AAR 396</a> at 397ff.  Heerey, J.'s judgment was upheld and generally
approved by the Full Court in <b>Repatriation Commission v. Deledio</b>
(Beaumont, Hill and O'Connor, JJ, 23 March 1998)].  In recent years it has been
enough that the material before a decision-maker
raised a 'reasonable
hypothesis' of a causal connection between a veteran's injury, disease or death
and his operational service
[Part II claims relating to eligible service which
was not operational are determined on the balance of probabilities, see ss.6,
7
and 120(4).  Claims for defence-service pension under Part VI are treated in
the same manner as Part II pensions with a standard
of proof distinction
between peacekeeping or hazardous service and ordinary defence service (see
ss.70, 120(2), 120(4))] and did
not disprove entitlement beyond reasonable
doubt [s.120(1) and (3) explained in <b>Byrnes v. Repatriation Commission</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20565" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 565</a> at 571, summarising the effect of <b>Bushell v. Repatriation
Commission</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/47.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 47</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20408" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 408].</a>
<P>

	5.	The 1994 amendments retained this provision, with an added requirement that
he hypothesis must be upheld by a SoP [see ss.120A,
120B.  The scheme of the
amendments is summarised and explained in <b>Deledio's</b> case (supra) and
<b>Beale v. Administrative Appeals Tribunal</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2036%20AAR%20497" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 36 AAR 497</a> at 500].
Separate SoPs are made for each kind of injury, disease or death, and set out
the aetiological factors which must be addressed
before a claim can be granted.
They are made by the Repatriation Medical Authority (RMA) under s.196B, and are
subject to review
by the Specialist Medical Review Council (SMRC) under
s.196W.
<P>

	6.	The Act expressly limits to 'sound medical - scientific evidence', as
defined in s.5AB(2), the material upon which the RMA and
SMRC may form a
judgment on whether factors should be included in a SoP [see s.196B(2), (3),
(5), (6), 196C(3) and s.196W(4), (5)]."
<P>

60	As the above comparison of the parties' respective positions shows, as to
the most of the matters of statutory interpretation
referred to, the parties'
views differ little.  I can therefore deal with much that has been put before
me more briefly than otherwise
would have been the case.
<P>

61	It is common ground that s.5AB(2) does not require information to establish
itself, directly (ie. prove) whether according to
scientific or epidemiological
principles a relevant causal connection between a factor and a particular kind
of injury, disease or
death existed before it can be considered to be, applying
the definition "sound medical-scientific evidence".  The Commission, however,
asserts that information about how a relevant condition may be caused would not
be "sound medical-scientific evidence" if, on application
to it of the criteria
for assessing causation currently applicable in epidemiology, it did not
achieve acceptance as causal in the
sense used in the reasoning of the SMRC set
out in paragraphs 21 and 25 above.  Thus there are distinctions between the
parties'
positions, as to the role played by the definition in the process of
applying the criteria to information and therefore identifying
sound
medical-scientific evidence.  I therefore turn to the plaintiff's criticisms of
the process here and its submissions as to
the proper construction of the
Act.
<P>

62	In essence, the plaintiff contended that the SMRC adopted an approach to its
function in making the relevant SoPs of requiring
there be evidence concerning
a factor which evidence established a relevant causal connection between the
factor and the particular
kind of injury, disease or death as probable to the
degree which would satisfy the science of epidemiology before that evidence was
accepted as "sound medical-scientific evidence" and that this approach was not
in accord with the proper construction of s.5AB(2).
 In addition, although it
was but faintly argued, a contention was not abandoned to the effect that the
reasons given by the SMRC
in each case failed to show the correct approach had
been adopted or were inadequate, such as to show legal error.  If the express
reasons disclosed essential error, I need not deal with this latter
submission.
<P>

63	The defendant asserts that the plaintiff has incorrectly described the
approach of the SMRC.  It contends that the reasons given
were adequate and
that the SMRC has in each challenged respect comported itself in accord with
the proper construction of the statute.
<P>

64	Notwithstanding the detail in which the submissions have been couched as to
the background history of the provisions and accepting
that both submissions
seek that I interpret the provisions by discerning the purpose they are to
serve in the statutory scheme, I
should at the outset and particularly have
regard to the Federal Court decision in the proceedings between these parties
in which
it was sought, even if unsuccessfully, to raise the very issue.  In
<b>Vietnam Veterans</b> (supra) Tamberlin, J. refers to the role of the Council
and the purpose of the Statements at s.422B thus:-
<P>

	"The Council is a body corporate with perpetual succession under s.196V of the
Act.  Its functions are set out in s.196W and include
the review of the
contents of a Statement determined by the Authority.
<P>

	The purpose of the Statements, in broad terms, is to provide the medical
-scientific frame of reference when a claim is made for
a pension or allowance
for an injury, disease or death connected with service in the armed forces.  If
the claimed injury, disease
or death is of a kind that is the subject of a
Statement then, where s.120(3) applies, a hypothesis of causation by service
will
be reasonable for the purpose of that subsection only if the Statement
upholds that hypothesis.  Similarly, where s.120(4) applies
the Commission can
be reasonably satisfied that the injury, disease or death was war-caused or
defence-caused, only if the Statement
relating to that kind of injury, disease
or death, upholds the contention that the injury, disease or death is on the
balance of
probabilities connected with the person's service.
<P>

	A 'reasonable hypothesis' arises in the context of a pension claim and relates
to the nexus between the particular circumstances
of the individual's service
and his or her injury, disease or death.
<P>

	Neither the Authority nor the Council is concerned with determining whether or
not, as a general proposition, it is in fact a 'reasonable
hypothesis' that a
particular factor causes a particular kind of injury, disease or death.  One or
more factors contained within
a Statement must, however, provide support for
the medical - scientific link which forms part of a 'reasonable hypothesis'
where
the Statement is relied upon to uphold the suggested chain of causation,
which links the particular circumstances of a veteran's
service to his or her
injury, disease or death.  Therefore, the factors contained in a s.196B(2)
Statement must be such that it can
be said, in relation to every person for
whom a factor is relevant and who has suffered or contracted or died from the
relevant kind
of injury or disease, that a 'reasonable hypothesis' has been
raised connecting that person's injury, disease or death with his or
her
service.
<P>

	...
<P>

	The Authority is an expert body comprised by a chairperson and four other
members.  One of these members must be a person having
at least five years
experience in the field of epidemiology (s.196L).
<P>

	The chairperson and the other members must be registered medical practitioners
or medical scientists with at least 10 years experience
(s.196M).
<P>

	The Council is also a body constituted by medical experts.  Under s.169ZF the
minister can only appoint a person to be a councillor
if the person is a
registered medical practitioner or medical scientist with at least 10 years
experience.  The Council is to have
such numbers of members as the minister
determines (s.196ZE).  It is a body corporate with perpetual succession and its
debts are
taken to be incurred by the Commonwealth (s.196V).
<P>

	The main function of the Council is to carry out a review of the contents of
Statements in respect of particular kinds of injury,
disease or death by
reviewing all information available to the Authority when it amended or
determined the Statement under review
(s.196W).
<P>

	By s.196Y the Council can be requested to review the contents of a Statement.
Where it receives such a request and it is of the
view that there is some
medical evidence on which the Authority could have relied to amend or determine
the Statement, the Council
must make a declaration in writing, to amend the
Statement, or to determine the Statement in accordance with directions of the
Council.
 It may also remit the matter for reconsideration in accordance with
any directions of the Council (s.196W(4))."
<P>

65	The decision and his Honour's views were noted without disapproval after an
extensive review of the history of the provisions
and the statutory scheme in
<b>re Jenkin v. Repatriation Commission</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2024%20AAR%20494" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 24 AAR 494.</a>

66	The Full Court of the Federal Court in <b>Repatriation Commission v.

<P>

	<b>"The legislative scheme</b>
<P>

	The scheme of the 1986 Act which, as we shall see, was supplemented by the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/va199495bmlaa1994508/" class="autolink_findacts">Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Act 1994</a>
(Cth) (the 1994 Amendments) is as follows:-
<P>

	*	Where a claim for a pension in respect of the death of a veteran relates to
the operational service rendered by the veteran,
the Commission shall determine
that the death was war-caused, unless it is satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt,
that there is no sufficient
ground for making that determination:  s.120(1),
1986 Act.  As we will see, s.120(1) is 'affected' by s.120A, one of the 1994
Amendments.
<P>

	*	The Commission shall be so satisfied if, after considering the whole of the
material before it, the Commission is of the opinion
that this material does
not raise a reasonable hypothesis connecting the death with the circumstances
of the particular service rendered:
 s.120(3), 1986 Act.  This provision is
also affected by s.120A.
<P>

	*	Except in making a determination to which s.120(1) applies, the Commission
shall, in making any determination or decision, decide
the matter to its
reasonable satisfaction:  s.120(4).  This provision is affected by s.120B,
another of the 1994 Amendments.
<P>

	*	Nothing in s.120 or in any other provision shall entitle the Commission to
presume that a death is war-caused:  s.120(5).
<P>

	*	Nothing in s.120 or in any other provision shall be taken to impose on - (a)
a claimant;  or (b) the Commonwealth, the Department
or any other person - any
onus of proving any matter that is, or might be, relevant to the determination
of the claim:  s.120(6).
<P>

	So far as is now material, these provisions were supplemented by the 1994
Amendments as follows:-
<P>

	*	If the Repatriation Medical Authority (established under the 1994
Amendments) is of the view on the 'sound medical - scientific
evidence'
available it is more probable than not that a particular kind of death 'can be
related' to operational service, the Authority
must determine a Statement of
Principles (SoP) in respect of that kind of death setting out - (i) the factors
that must as a minimum
exist;  and (ii) which of those factors must be related
to service - before it can be said that a reasonable hypothesis has been
raised
'connecting' a death of that kind with the circumstances of that service.
<P>

	*	If the Repatriation Medical Authority is of the view that on the sound
medical - scientific evidence available it is more probable
than not that a
particular kind of death can be related to eligible war service (other than
operation war service), the Authority
must determine an SoP in respect of that
kind of death setting out (i) the factors that must exist;  and (ii) which of
those factors
that must be related to service - before it can be said that, on
the balance of probabilities, a death of that kind is 'connected
with' the
circumstances of that service:  s.196B(3) and the 1986 Act.
<P>

	These provisions should be read in the light of the following dictionary
provisions:-
<P>

	Information about a particular kind of death is taken to be 'sound medical
-scientific evidence' if:  (a) the information:  (i)
is consistent with
material relating to medical science that has been published in a medical or
scientific publication and, in the
Authority's opinion, has been subjected to a
peer review process;  or (ii) in accordance with generally accepted medical
practice,
would serve as the basis for the diagnosis and management of a
medical condition;  and (b) in the case of information about how the
kind of
death may be caused - meets the applicable criteria for assessing causation
currently applied in the field of epidemiology
(s.5AB(2) of the 1986 Act).  A
factor causing, or contributing to a death is 'related to service' if, inter
alia:  (i) it arose out
of, or was attributable to, that service;  or (ii) it
was contributed to in a material degree by, or was aggravated by, that service:
s.196B(14) of the 1986 Act.  This provision is consistent with the definition
of 'war-caused death' in s.8 of the 1986 Act.
<P>

	*	In the case of a claim (as here) made on or after 1 June 1994 that relates
to operational service, for the purposes of s.120(3)
of the 1986 Act, 'a
hypothesis connecting' the death of a person with the circumstances of any
particular service is reasonable only
if there is in force an SoP that upholds
the hypothesis:  s.120A(3) of the 1986 Act.
<P>

	*	In the case of a claim made on or after 1 June 1994 that relates to eligible
war service (other than operational service), in
applying s.120(4) of the 1986
Act to determine a claim, the Commission is to be reasonably satisfied that the
death of a person was
war-caused only if:  (a) the material before the
Commission raises a connection between the death and some particular service;
and
(b) there is in force an SoP that upholds the contention that the death is,
on the balance of probabilities, connected with that
service:  s.120B(3) of the
1986 Act."
<P>

67	Their Honours described the process of determination of a claim and the role
the SoPs assumes at 159-160:-
<P>

	"1.	The Tribunal must consider all the material which is before it and
determine whether that material points to a hypothesis connecting
the injury,
disease or death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by
the person.  No question of fact finding
arises at this stage.  If no such
hypothesis arises, the application must fail.
<P>

	2.	If the material does raise such a hypothesis, the Tribunal must then
ascertain whether there is in force an SoP determined by
the Authority under
s.196B(2) or (11) of the 1986 Act.  If no such SoP is in force, the hypothesis
will be taken not to be reasonable
and, in consequence, the application must
fail.
<P>

	3.	If an SoP is in force, the Tribunal must then form the opinion whether the
hypothesis raised is a reasonable one.  It will do
so if the hypothesis fits,
that is to say, is consistent with the 'template' to be found in the SoP.  The
hypothesis raised before
it must thus contain one or more of the factors which
the Authority has determined to be the minimum which must exist, and be related
to the person's service (as required by s.196B(2)(d) and (e)).  If the
hypothesis does contain these factors, it could neither be
said to be contrary
to proved or known scientific facts, nor otherwise fanciful.  If the hypothesis
fails to fit within the template,
it will be deemed not to be 'reasonable' and
the claim will fail.
<P>

	4.	The Tribunal must then proceed to consider under s.120(1) whether it is
satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the death was
not war-caused, or in the
case of a claim for incapacity, that the incapacity did not arise from a
war-caused injury.  If not so
satisfied, the claim must succeed.  If the
Tribunal is so satisfied, the claim must fail.  It is only at this stage of the
process
that the Tribunal will be required to find facts from the material
before it.  In so doing, no question of onus of proof or the application
of any
presumption will be involved." 
<P>

68	That scheme was also examined in detail by Heery, J. in <b>Deledio</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2025%20AAR%20396" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 25 AAR 396</a> at first instance and in <b>re Repatriation Commission v.

in <b>Beale </b>(supra).  Since the history of the legislation in its various
forms has been so often examined judicially and extensively it is not
necessary
for me further to dwell on it here.
<P>

<b>Construing the definition</b>
<P>

69	It is appropriate that, adopting the modern purposive approach to
construction in interpreting s.5AB(2) and in particular s.5AB(2)(b),
I apply
the views expressed in these cases and the extrinsic material concerning the
role of SoPs in the determination of claims
in considering whether the Act's
requirements for the making of an SoP, or on review by the SMRC, envisage that
it would be appropriate
for the RMA or the SMRC to form a view that an
hypothesised causal factor would only be included as "sound medical-scientific
evidence"
in the event that it satisfies a scientific test of causation, ie.
scientifically proves a causative link between it and the kind
of injury,
disease or death in question, where that form of scientific proof accords with
the available criteria for assessing causation
currently applied in the field
of epidemiology.  This is the construction that it is asserted supports the
mode of reasoning the
plaintiff contends the SMRC adopted.  It is in question
whether such construction accords with the statute and if not, what appropriate
process should be undertaken to identify "sound medical-scientific evidence".
As I have said, both parties' submissions eschewed
a construction favouring the
discernment of a legislative requirement for a direct causal link to be
established.  The plaintiff
contends that the construction applied by SMRC is
an overly restrictive approach which incorrectly requires information to prove
or establish causal links, even if not directly, rather than that it assist in
identifying a causative potential.
<P>

70	I note from the language of the sections and the extrinsic materials,
considered in the light of the case law, that the whole
intent of the
amendments was not to exclude an hypothesis as to causation in an individual
case which was a reasonable hypothesis
and within the ambit or based on factors
stipulated in an applicable SoP.  It is, in the light of the nature of the Act,
its history,
the case law and the extrinsic materials, highly unlikely that the
requirements for causal factors in an SoP should be limited to
those
scientifically established to have that effect rather than those which have
potential to have the causal effect.  The necessity
for the information to be
capable of being assessed by scientific criteria for its causal value would be
sufficient to enable the
exclusion of hypotheses based on unassessable or
incredible information.  It is the exclusion of claims so based that is said to
be the object of the legislation.
<P>

71	The very concept of an SoP as a template to prescribe the bounds of
legitimate enquiry into causative factors points to a construction
of
s.5AB(2)(b) as referring to information as to factors having the capability of
bringing about or contributing to the kind of injury,
disease or death in
question and that the assessment of information as to factors having that
capability is to be according to the
criteria for assessing causation currently
applied in the field of epidemiology.
<P>

72	On my reading of the language, the definition in s.5AB(2)(b) does not deal
with actual causes, scientifically proved causes or
reasonable or other
hypotheses.  It deals with information about how particular kinds of injury,
disease or death may be caused.
 The definition looks not to the factors but to
information as to how those conditions might potentially be caused by factors.
The
information must be capable of having the criteria for assessing the
potential for a factor to be causative applied to it.  It is
not whether the
factor is causative that is the focus of the definition.  It is the capability
of application of the criteria to
the information and whether the application
of those criteria will permit assessment of how the condition may be caused by
the factor.
 The criteria are applied to ascertain whether that information is
of value for assessing, one way or another, the potential effect
of a possible
causal factor, not to exclude all information as to factors unless their actual
causal effect is, by that information
proved.
<P>

73	The definition would enable the exclusion of that information as to causes
which is incapable of being assessed for the potential
of a factor to be causal
by the applicable criteria for the assessment of causation as currently applied
in the field of epidemiology.
 Insofar as  factors are relied on as direct or
indirect causes (ie. as initiating or contributing) for that kind of injury,
disease
or death in question, information about them so far as concerns their
causative capacity must meet the criteria, ie., be capable
of being thereby
assessed for the purpose I have described.
<P>

74	Unless the information is about how factors may be causes, it is merely
necessary that it meet the criteria in s.5AB(2)(a), ie.
as to consistency with
published material which has been subjected in the opinion of the RMA is to a
peer review or accord with generally
accepted medical practice as a basis for
diagnosis and management.  It would be an error to exclude any such information
as to an
operative or contextual factor on the basis that, although it complied
with (a), it did not comply with (b), if the information was
not about how the
condition might be caused, ie., linked to the production of or contributing to
the condition in question.
<P>

75	The definition, in focusing on how a relevant condition may be caused, not
only looks to information concerning causal potential
but contemplates that
information excluding a causal capacity would answer its requirements.  If the
information as to the factor
and its relationship with the condition is about
how the condition might be caused in some but not all cases and that
information
is assessable using the criteria it would answer the definition
(albeit care would need to be taken in expressing width of the relevant
factor
in an SoP).
<P>

76	Information whose value is assessable under the criteria relevant to the
causal potential or capacity of a factor, would be sound
medical-scientific
evidence and, ex hypothesi, it would be an error to require the information to
be shown to be in every case such
as to establish an operative causal factor.

<P>

77	To require its actual causal effect and the extent of it to be established
and stipulated in an SoP before a claim reliant on
it in whole or in part could
succeed, would involve a great departure from the purpose the extrinsic
material shows the provision
was meant to achieve.  It would result in the
rejection of reasonable hypotheses and fanciful hypotheses alike by cutting the
ground
from under all hypotheses except those relying on information which had
already been determined to prove a causal link, ie. those
reliant on proven
rather than hypothetical states.
<P>

78	Thus, I have concluded that it is the capability of the information of
allowing the assessment of causation that is in question,
not whether in fact a
factor is causative.  The latter is left to the determination in the individual
case.  The SoP prescribes those
factors which may have that capability
according to information meeting the applicable criteria.  It is in error for
the RMA or the
SMRC to require that a causal link, be demonstrated such that
the principles of epidemiology would regard that link as established
before
such a factor is included in an SoP.
<P>

<b>The plaintiff's submissions</b>
<P>

79	I therefore accept the submission put on behalf of the plaintiffs that the
Act proposes a beneficial test of causation as is
shown in the language of
s.196B(2) as compared to s.196B(3), cf. the Explanatory Memorandum at p.10:-
<P>

	"New s.196B(2) requires the Repatriation Medical Authority to determine a
Statement of Principles, in circumstance where it is
of the view that there is
sound medical-scientific evidence justifying it doing so, relating injury,
disease or death to the minimum
factors it considers necessary before a
reasonable hypothesis can be raised."
<P>

80	I accept what is submitted in paragraphs 26, 27, 28 and 29 of the
plaintiff's submissions which is as follows:-
<P>

	"26.	To construe s.5AB(2) so as to enable the fullest operation to the
beneficial standard of proof would be consistent with the
opinion of Heerey,
J., specifically approved by the Full Court of the Federal Court, that: 'the
new regime of SoPs has to be given
an operation consistent with ss.120(1) and
120(3) as expounded by the High Court in <b>Bushell</b> and <b>Byrnes</b>'
[<b>Deledio's case</b> (supra) at 410, Full Court at 13].
<P>

	27.	It is consistent with the Minister's statement: 'These changes maintain a
beneficial repatriation system, including a "reasonable
hypothesis" standard,
as modified as I have already outlined, for deciding compensation claims for
death or disease or relating to
eligible war service.  There has not been a
return to a civil standard of proof ...' [Hansard, House of Representatives, 9
June 1994,
p.1809.  See <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aia1901230/s15ab.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.15AB</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aia1901230/" class="autolink_findacts">Acts Interpretation Act 1901</a> (Cth)].
<P>

	28.	It is consistent with the Explanatory Memorandum's understanding that
'full scientific proof will not be required for an hypothesis
to be reasonable
and more than a single hypothesis of causation in relation to a disease, injury
or death can be reasonable', and
that for veterans without operational service
'the Authority will ... determine medical contentions at the "reasonable
satisfaction"
standard of proof of s.120(4)' [Explanatory Memorandum, House of
Representatives, for the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/va199495bmlab1994518/" class="autolink_findacts">Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures)
Legislation Amendment Bill 1994</a> (Cth), p.3].
<P>

	29.	It is consistent with the court's obligation to prefer a construction
promoting the objecting underlying the Act [s.15AA of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aia1901230/" class="autolink_findacts">Acts Interpretation
Act 1901</a> (Cth).  As to the beneficial nature of this legislation:
<b>Repatriation Commission v. Hawkins</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1993/479.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] FCA 479</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2045%20FCR%20205" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 45 FCR 205</a> at 211], and with
"the modern approach to statutory interpretation [which] (a) insists that the
context be considered in the first
instance, not merely at some later stage
when ambiguity might be thought to arise, and (b) uses "context" in its widest
sense to
include such things as the existing state of the law and the mischief
which, by legitimate means such as those just mentioned, one
may discern the
statute was intended to remedy. ...  Further, inconvenience or improbability of
result may assist the court in preferring
to the literal meaning an alternative
construction which, by the steps identified above, is reasonably open and more
closely conforms
to the legislative intent' [<b>CIC Insurance Limited v.
Bankstown Football Club Limited </b>(1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408.  See also
<b>Saraswati v. The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1991/21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1991] HCA 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20172%20CLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 172 CLR 1</a> per McHugh, J. at 22 citing
<b>Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty. Limited v. Commissioner of Taxation of the
Commonwealth </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1981/26.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] HCA 26</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%20147%20CLR%20297" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 147 CLR 297]."</a>
<P>

81	As is submitted by the plaintiff, in the event that "sound
medical-scientific evidence" prescribes actual causes then the necessity
for
further enquiry into relationship would seem of little utility.  It would only
be necessary to deal with possible exposure in
service.  One would no longer be
dealing with reasonable hypotheses but actual proved causes.  Indeed the
distinction between a proposition
"not obviously fanciful, impossible,
incredible, not tenable or too remote or too tenuous", "more than a
possibility, not fanciful
or unreal, consistent with the known facts" (see
<b>East v. Repatriation Commission</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1987/242.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] FCA 242</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2016%20FCR%20517" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 16 FCR 517</a> at 532-533)
illustrates the very difference.  Where the aetiology of a disease, injury or
death is uncertain, and there is information
as to factors which are capable of
assisting the determination of whether that kind of disease, injury or death
can be related to
war service, such information will be sound
medical-scientific evidence if it meets the criteria in s.5AB(2)(a) and (b) and
insofar
as that information is about the causative capacity of a factor, ie.
whether it is capable of causing that disease, injury or death,
if it is not
excluded by the current epidemiological criteria and is assessable by them.
<P>

82	I am fortified in my conclusion by the exegeses on causation and the
treatment of it in the Act from time to time in those cases
which trace the
history of the Act I have referred to above and those which are set out in the
submissions and the discussion of
the continued acceptability of reasonable
hypotheses contained in the extrinsic materials provided.
<P>

<b>Instances of error</b>
<P>

83	There are within the reasons of the SMRC, both generally and in particular,
illustrations showing that the Council has thus erred
in its approach to its
task in both matters when I apply the construction I favour.  The extracts set
out in paragraphs 21 and 23
above from each set of reasons display generally
the error of approach.
<P>

84	Further, when one turns to the examination of the specific issues in each
set of reasons, it can be seen that the SMRC was concerned
to ascertain whether
causation had been established by particular factors.
<P>

85	An illustration of the application of a necessity of scientific proof
according to the criteria of epidemiology of causation,
in particular, is to be
found at p.36 and following of the reasons in respect of SoPs 95 and 96 of 1995
under the heading "<b>Studies concerning smoking and prostate cancer</b>". The
reasoning appears to deal with a direct causative relationship between smoking
and prostate cancer rather than  examining information
about the causative
potential of smoking as a factor in a disease, injury or death occasioned by
prostate cancer.  The nature of
association being discussed appears to be that
of a direct link.  A mortality associated with contra-indications for surgery,
otherwise
available, to prevent or minimise the risk of injury, disease or
death from prostate cancer where the contra-indicators are occasioned
by
smoking, would illustrate an association which might well relate a particular
kind of disease, injury or death to war service
where war service is related to
smoking as a logical proposition.  Such may be the case as to a link between a
diet rich in animal
fat and high energy carbohydrates and prostate cancer.  One
would not have thought that information of those kinds would be excluded
by the
criteria. Interestingly, where the SMRC turned to inability to obtain
appropriate clinical management, it did not re-examine
the effects of smoking
induced contra-indications but accepted that information as to those matters
might constitute sound medical
evidence on the basis of sub-paragraph (a)(ii)
of the definition in s.5AB(2).
<P>

86	The portion of the SMRC's reasons headed "Assessment of cigarette smoking
theory against Bradford Hill criteria" commencing at
p.39 appears to proceed on
the basis that it is necessary for the Bradford Hill individual criteria
discussed to be positively met
and to be of substantial strength overall before
it can be said that cigarette smoking as a factor is supported by sound
medical-scientific
evidence.  The criteria were applied to ascertain whether
the link could be directly established, and to whether to substantial extent
not whether the information was required to be excluded as describing how the
death, disease or injury may be caused or showed potential
causal effect.
<P>

87	Similarly, later in the reasons the dismissal of the Morrison Study on the
basis that it fails to demonstrate sufficient strength,
to provide sufficient
information of sufficient weight and demonstrate an appropriate mechanism
indicates, in my view, error.
<P>

88	In relation to SoPs No. 95 and 96 of 1995, the conclusion of the SMRC was as
follows:-
<P>

	"<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

	The epidemiological criteria, not having been satisfied in relation to
cigarette smoking and prostate cancer, there is no sound
medical-scientific
evidence that justifies the inclusion of cigarette smoking as a factor in a
Statement of Principles concerning
malignant neoplasm of the prostate."
<P>

89	That conclusion appears to proceed upon the basis that causation has not
been proved according to those criteria.  In view of
the task conferred upon
SMRC of ascertaining what is sound medical-scientific evidence, it also appears
to be circular.  I am of
the view the SMRC fell into error for the reasons I
have given.
<P>

90	In the reasons of the SMRC when reviewing SoPs 245 of 1995 and 246 of 1996
there is the same error.
<P>

91	That error is further particularly illustrated there when, in discussing the
role of trauma, the distinction is drawn between
trauma that revealed motor
neuron disease, which had been present for decades, and traumata which
themselves, by somehow affecting
the body, caused the development of motor
neuron disease, ie. a distinction between a coincidental association or a
direct cause.
 The lack of established temporality led to the SMRC concluding
that the material did not establish cause at sufficient strength.
<P>

92	As to "the 'solvent' theory", the SMRC noted the claims of strength of
association between organic solvents and motor neuron
disease and the original
acceptance of the Repatriation Commission noted above of the inclusion of
solvents as a causal mechanism
but also noted the later view of the
Commission:-
<P>

	"... that there is some evidence of a causal relationship but would also note
that the evidence is weak and accepts that the Authority
may well have been
correct in judging that the relationship was not truly causal".
<P>

93	In this passage is expressly encapsulated the error I have detected in
application of the provisions in the light of the construction
I have held is
appropriate.  Unless the information established cause, it was held not to be
"sound medical-scientific evidence".
<P>

94	The SMRC concluded:-
<P>

	"Without the particular evidence on the specific criteria of exposure to any
solvent, a contention was not possible for either
Statement of Principles."
<P>

95	Thus no factor of this kind (however described) was to be included in the
SoP notwithstanding there was material before the SMRC
which on its own
analysis appeared to answer the epidemiological criteria as to potential or
capability to some degree at least.
 The objections arising from a lack of
clarity as to the specificity of the association between the relevant
conditions and solvents
and the treatment of the aspects of duration and
particular substance within the category "organic solvents" show that what was
required
of the factor "exposure to organic solvents" was not only information
as to capacity to be causal but the establishment of a direct
cause.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

96	I therefore conclude that in each proceedings it has been established that
the SMRC fell into relevant error as to the construction
and application of the
statutory test that it was required to apply such that in prescribing the
quasi-legislative instruments provided
for by the legislation, it has failed to
observe the legislative requirements.  I also conclude that it erred
procedurally in failing
to afford the plaintiff the statutory opportunity to be
heard on matters wider than those raised in the application for review in
the
specific instance to which I have referred.
<P>

97	Having reached these conclusions, it may well be that it is not necessary
for me to examine any further questions in this litigation
before turning to
the appropriate relief.
<P>

98	The matter will therefore be re-listed before me to permit the parties to
prepare short minutes to give effect to these views
I have formed, otherwise to
nominate such further questions as it may be necessary to deal with, if any,
and if necessary, for directions
as to any argument or submissions on the
appropriate relief and costs.
<P>
