<b>1338/99  -  RONALD JOHN DEAN-WILLCOCKS V GSA FORMWORK (NSW) PTY LTD</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (EX TEMPORE &amp; REVISED)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  By summons filed on 12 February 1999 the plaintiff seeks an
order that a deed of company arrangement entered into
between him and GSA
Formwork (NSW) Pty Limited (`GSA') dated 10 March 1998 (`the DCA') be
terminated pursuant to either s.445D or
s.447A of the Corporations Law.
<P>

2	The circumstances surrounding the application are as follows.  Mr
Dean-Willcocks was appointed under s.5.3A of the Corporations
Law as the
administrator of GSA on 21 January 1998. At that time there were twenty
creditors whose debts totalled $639,903.83. A
meeting of creditors resolved on
25 January 1998 pursuant to s.439C to enter into the DCA, and as I have
mentioned the DCA was entered
into on 10 March 1998. The following are some
relevant provisions of the DCA: 
<P>

	(a) GSA is required to make payments to Mr Dean-Willcocks as administrator
which include monthly payments up to 1 August 1999;

<P>

	(b) GSA must provide quarterly accounts to the administrator;
<P>

	(c) participating creditors are those whose payments arose before 21 January
1998; 
<P>

	(d) 	 the participating creditors are to receive fifteen cents in the dollar;

<P>

	(e) certain priority creditors including employees have priority over the
participating creditors;
<P>

	(f) there is a moratorium on further steps by the participating creditors to
recover against GSA and when payment is made to them
under the deed they will
release all further claims against GSA;
<P>

	(g) GSA is required to grant a charge to the administrator to secure its
obligations under the DCA; 
<P>

	(h) GSA covenants to remit all group tax and prescribed payments tax; 
<P>

	(i) certain `non-participating creditors' agree to waive their entitlements to
participate in dividends; 
<P>

	(j) the DCA may be terminated in the circumstances prescribed by the clause
45;
<P>

	(k) upon the adoption of the DCA control of GSA reverts to its directors;
<P>

	(l) if GSA performs its obligations under the deed, it is contemplated that
the DCA will be terminated in about October 1999. 
<P>

3	On 4 February 1999 one of the two directors of GSA received a letter from the
Australian Taxation Office dated 2 February 1999,
enclosing two penalty notices
issued under the Income Tax Assessment Act.  The notices informed the director,
Mr Falcetta, in compliance
with s.222APE, that notices of estimate dated 1
February 1999 had been sent to GSA in respect of deductions for prescribed
payments
and tax instalments deductions.  The unpaid amounts of the estimate
were $30,000 for prescribed payments and $210,576.69 for tax
instalments
deductions. 
<P>

4	The notices informed Mr Falcetta in accordance with s.222APE that at the end
of fourteen days after the notices of estimate were
sent to GSA he would, as a
director of the company, be liable to pay an amount equal to each estimate.
The notices further stated
that the estimate would be remitted if, at the end
of fourteen days after the notice was given to him, one of a number of stated
events had occurred, including that `the company is being wound up' (see
s.222APE(1)(b)(iv)).
<P>

5	Mr Falcetta approached Mr Geoff McDonald of Paul Chadwick. Mr McDonald is a
registered liquidator. On his advice and with his
assistance the directors of
GSA subsequently convened a meeting of the company's creditors. He was
instructed to compile a report
as to GSA's affairs. The meeting of creditors
was convened by notice dated 10 February 1999, to be held at 10am tomorrow, 17
February
1999.
<P>

6	The agenda includes items to consider special resolutions of members (which
are to be voted on by the members later in the day)
to wind the company up
voluntarily, to appoint Mr McDonald as liquidator and to consider a report on
the affairs of the company provided
under s.497 of the Corporations Law.  If
those resolutions are passed by the members the company will be `being wound
up' and presumably
Mr Falcetta will avoid personal liability for tax under the
s.222APE notices.
<P>

7	The notice of meeting includes a list of creditors comprising nine creditors
of whom Mr Dean-Willcocks is one.  The debts of the
listed creditors total
$605,000 although some debts of named creditors have not yet been calculated.
Mr Dean-Willcocks has said in
his affidavit which was in evidence before me
that he presumes the debts of the listed creditors (apart from himself and
possibly
certain directors) were incurred after the date of the DCA. He is
therefore treated as representing the creditors affected by the
DCA (that is
the pre-21 January 1998 creditors). He notes that the listed creditors do not
include trade creditors, utility creditors
and subcontractors. 
<P>

8	The directors of GSA met on 12 February 1999 and resolved to support the
present application to this Court.  As I have mentioned,
the plaintiff seeks an
order that the DCA be terminated by the Court either under s.445D or s.447A of
the Corporations Law.  The
application will have the result, as I shall
explain, that Mr Dean-Willcocks will become the liquidator of GSA in voluntary
liquidation
as a result of orders of the Court, and tomorrow's meetings of
members and creditors will have no decision to make on the subject
of winding
up GSA.  According to Mr Falcetta the company is insolvent. Therefore it is
likely that the winding up of GSA, however
it maybe inaugurated, will proceed
in the absence of a solvency declaration by the directors under s.496 and
therefore will be a
creditors voluntary winding up.
<P>

9	Notice of the plaintiff's application has been given to Mr McDonald and to
the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation. I was informed
by Mr Fordyce, the
plaintiff's solicitor, at today's hearing that he was told by Mr McDonald that
Mr McDonald did not intend to appear
but may make a written submission by
facsimile.  No such submission has been received from him. According to Mr
Fordyce no response
has been received from the Australian Taxation Office.
<P>

10	An order terminating the DCA produces a winding up in the following way.
Section 446B(1) authorises regulations to be made to
prescribe cases where a
company that is executing a deed of company arrangement is taken to have passed
a special resolution under
s 491 that the company be wound up voluntarily.
Regulation 5.3A.07(1) of the Corporations Regulations states that for the
purposes
of s.446B(1) a company that has executed a deed of company arrangement
is taken to have passed a special resolution under s.491 that
the company be
wound up voluntarily if (inter alia) the Court makes an order terminating the
deed of company arrangement.  Under
regulation 5.3A.07(4) the company is taken
to have nominated the administrator of the deed of company arrangement as the
liquidator
in the winding up.
<P>

11	Thus if the Court makes an order under s.445D (though not apparently if the
order is made under s.447A) the company moves into
voluntary liquidation by
virtue of the order. In the present circumstances, a consequence is that Mr
Dean-Willcocks rather than Mr
McDonald becomes the liquidator.
<P>

12	Given that an order under s.447A may not be effective to achieve the
plaintiff's purpose, and that I have reached the conclusion
that an order
should be made under s.445D, I should say no more about s.447A, and I now turn
to consider s.445D. 
<P>

13	In the present case there are some grounds for caution about the exercise of
relevant judicial discretions. One such ground arises
out of the existence of a
procedure for termination of the DCA set out in clauses 4 and 5 of that
instrument, involving a meeting
of creditors and participation by the
administrator.  However I assume that it is not practicable at this stage to
convene a meeting
of the twenty creditors who participated under the  DCA
within the time limit imposed by the Australian Taxation Office's s.222APE
notices.  Further the only available ground for termination under the deed
would appear to be under clause 4(c) which refers to a
resolution of creditors
under Pt 5.3A Division 11.  I assume that the relevant resolution would be
under s.445E and again I assume
that there is insufficient time to convene a
meeting of creditors to proceed in this way if the relevant condition under the
s.222APE
notices is to be satisfied.  Consequently I proceed on the basis that
although the deed contains a provision for its termination,
that provision is
not as a matter of practicality available in the present circumstances.
<P>

14	A further ground for caution  is that a meeting of creditors, and also (I
infer) a meeting of members, has been convened for
tomorrow.  The effect of my
making the orders sought by the plaintiff is to deprive the members and
creditors of the opportunity
to express their views about whether the company
should be placed in voluntary liquidation before that event occurs.
<P>

15	However in the present case the fact that those meetings have been convened
is not as significant as it might be in other circumstances.
 Although the
decision to place a company in voluntary liquidation is normally a decision of
the members, the Corporations Law has
the effect of taking that decision out of
the hands of the members in certain situations falling within Pt 5.3A: see
s.446A(2) and
regulation 5.3A.07.  In situations which fall within those
provisions, the operative decision to place the company in voluntary
liquidation
is a decision by the creditors or the  Court respectively rather
than by the members.  Further, for reasons which I shall explain,
my opinion is
that proper notice of tomorrow's meeting of creditors has not been given, and
therefore there is at the very least
a real doubt as to whether the creditors
would be in the position to make any effective decisions at tomorrow's
meeting.
<P>

16	The plaintiff submits that I should make an order under s.445D(1)(d) or
s.445D(1)(g). Section 445D(1)(d) allows the Court to
make an order terminating
a deed of company arrangement if it is satisfied that there has been a material
contravention of the deed
by a person bound by the deed.  The plaintiff's
submission is that the decision by the directors to convene meetings of members
and
creditors to consider the voluntary winding up of GSA amounts to
anticipatory breach of the DCA by the company, because that conduct
makes it
clear that the company is not proposing to comply with the terms of the deed.
I do not accept the major premise of this
contention, namely that the convening
of the meeting is sufficient evidence of anticipatory breach by the company.
There is no evidence
before me as to the identity of the members nor as to
their likely decision if the meeting is held. I am not in the position to make
any inference as to the likely outcome of the meeting.  Therefore even if the
decision of the members to wind the company up, if
it is taken, constitutes
anticipatory breach, I do not believe that a case is made out at the present
time.  Having reached that
conclusion it is not necessary for me to decide
certain other questions which I regard as open to further argument: namely
whether
s 445D(1)(d) has any application in a case of anticipatory breach,
whether a resolution by members constitutes anticipatory breach
by their
company, and whether the DCA has prohibited and can validly prohibit steps
being taken to wind up the company voluntarily
under the Corporations Law.
<P>

17	The remaining ground upon which the plaintiff relies is in s.445D(1)(g).
That provision empowers the Court to make an order terminating
a deed of
company arrangement if it is satisfied that the deed should be terminated for
some other reason.  It is clear from the
circumstances surrounding its
enactment that this provision was intended to give the Court a very wide
discretion. The explanatory
memorandum to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/clrb1992235/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporate Law Reform Bill 1992</a>
which led to the enactment of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/clrb1992235/index.html#p5.3a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5.3A</a> makes the following comment on this
provision (paragraph 602): 
<P>

	`[The provision] will allow termination where the court considers the deed
should be terminated for some other reason.  It would
not be appropriate to try
to circumscribe more precisely the court's powers to terminate a deed in
exceptional circumstances but,
having regard to the width of previous
paragraphs in proposed subsection (1)(g) it is anticipated that the court's
powers under subs.(1)(g)
would be exercised at most very rarely.'
<P>

18	Although the exercise of the power may be rare, I am satisfied that it is an
available power and that it is appropriate to exercise
it in the circumstances
of the present case.
<P>

19	In reaching this conclusion, I have taken into account a number of factors.
First it is relevant that according to the evidence
before me, the company is
now insolvent. In those circumstances proceeding with the DCA may not be an
appropriate course of action,
having regard to the interests of the creditors
as a whole.  The evidence indicates that substantial additional debts have been
incurred
since the DCA was entered into. The DCA does not make appropriate
provision to protect the interests of the new creditors.
<P>

20	Secondly it is relevant that the pre-21 January 1998 creditors have chosen
to proceed by means of the DCA and no decision was
taken at that time for the
winding up of the company either by the Court or voluntarily. Having embarked
on the course of action
established by 5.3A it is appropriate for the
procedures of that Part to be followed through.  One of those procedures is to
deal
with the fate of the DCA in the circumstances which have now occurred.  If
I were not to intervene and leave the meetings of members
and creditors to
occur tomorrow, there would be some doubt as the effect of the decision taken
at those meetings on the DCA and the
position of the pre-21 January 1998
creditors under that instrument.  By making the orders which are sought, I can
avoid that doubt.

<P>

21	Thirdly, and most importantly, I am concerned that if the meeting of
creditors which has been convened for tomorrow goes ahead,
there will be scope
for serious argument as to the validity of the convening of the meeting and any
decision which the creditors
may take at that meeting.  In the first place it
appears from the evidence before me that no notice has been given to certain
creditors.
Section 497 of the Corporations Law, which envisages the convening
of a meeting of creditors in connection with the voluntary winding
up of the
company, obliges the company to give notice to the creditors - that is, all of
them.  As the plaintiff points out, it appears
from the notice which is in
evidence before me that only nine creditors are listed. No reference is made to
trade creditors or utility
creditors or subcontractors, even though the company
continues to trade.  Further it appears that notice has not been given to any
of the pre-21 January 1998 creditors, except to the extent that notice to the
plaintiff as administrator could be regarded as sufficient
notice to them.
<P>

22	Under clause 19(A) of the DCA the creditors who are bound by that covenant
agree `not to take or agree in the taking of any steps
to wind up the company'.
The passing of the resolution which the notice of the meeting of creditors
proposes, while it would not
be an operative step in the winding up of the
company, would in my opinion constitute `agreeing' in the taking of that step.
Therefore
the pre-21 January 1998 creditors would be prevented by their
covenant from voting at the creditors meeting. Nevertheless they remain
creditors of the company.  Although clauses 21 and 22 of the DCA provide for
the extinguishment of their debts, this is to occur
only after they have
received the distributions contemplated by the DCA. It has not occurred this
time. Since they therefore remain
creditors, under s.497 they are entitled to
receive notice and should have received notice of the meeting.
<P>

23	Further it is appears from the annexure to the notice of meeting that no
allowance has been made for the full value of the debts
of the pre-21 January
1998 creditors although, as I have mentioned, those debts still remain
outstanding notwithstanding the moratorium
under the DCA.
<P>

24	It is true that under s.1322 of the Corporations Law, a proceeding is not
invalidated because of a procedural irregularity unless
the Court is of the
opinion that the irregularity has caused or may cause substantial injustice
that cannot be remedied by order
of the Court and by order declares the meeting
to be invalid; and further, a meeting held for the purposes of the Corporations
Law
is not invalidated only because of an accidental omission to give notice of
the meeting unless the Court declares the proceedings
to be void.
<P>

25	In the present circumstances I regard failure to give notice to the pre-21
January 1998 creditors as a matter which may cause
substantial injustice that
cannot be remedied by an order of the Court and something which goes beyond the
mere accidental omission:
see, in particular, <i>Royal Mutual Benefit Building
Society v. Sharma</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%201%20WLR%2058" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] 1 WLR 58</a>; <i>Myer Queenstown Garden Plaza Pty
Limited Corporation v. City of Port Adelaide</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281975%29%2011%20SASR%20504" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1975) 11 SASR 504.</a>
<P>

26	Be that as it may, the deficiencies of notice to which I have referred are
matters which it is appropriate for me to take into
account in the exercise of
my discretion to intervene under s.445D(1)(g) rather than to leave the decision
as to the winding up of
the company to tomorrow's meeting.  Even if the
deficiencies could be cured under s.1322, the interests of certainty would
suggest
that it is appropriate to deal with the matter by orders today.
<P>

27	Next I take into account the fact that the directors have by resolution
supported the plaintiff's application to the Court, notwithstanding
that they
authorised Mr McDonald at an earlier stage to convene tomorrow's meeting of
creditors.  This change of heart is far from
determinative but is nevertheless
a relevant indication of the company's attitude.  
<P>

28	Finally, I have given some consideration to the effect of the order which I
propose to make on the recoverability of tax under
the provisions of s.222APE
of the Income Tax Assessment Act.  It might be said that by exercising its
discretion in the way proposed,
the Court is in effect aiding and abetting the
directors to avoid what would otherwise be a personal liability on their part
to pay
the estimated tax which has been assessed against GSA.  However in my
opinion that reasoning would be faulty.  Section 222APE of
the Act in terms
contemplates that the tax otherwise recoverable from the directors is to be
remitted in certain circumstances. 
Section 222APE(1)(b)(iv) specifies as one
of those circumstances that the company is being wound up.  In other words,
there is a
statutory gateway to the remission of tax which might otherwise be
paid by directors and it is available to be used if the winding
up of the
company has commenced in any appropriate way.  One way in which the winding up
of the company may commence is if I am satisfied
in the exercise of my
discretion that the DCA should be terminated. In that event the provisions of
the Corporations Law and Corporations
Regulations take over and cause a
creditors voluntary winding up to occur.
<P>

29	Weighing up as best I can all of the above circumstances, I have reached the
conclusion that in the special facts of this case
an order should be made under
s.445D(1)(g) for the termination of the DCA.  The plaintiff seeks an order for
costs and it appears
to me clear that order should also be made. Therefore I
propose to make the orders which the plaintiff seeks.
<P>

30	The plaintiff has handed up a draft order to reflect the reasons for
judgment which I have just given. I initial and date that
document for the
purposes of identification and I make orders 1 and 2 in that document.
