&amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

JUDGMENT
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  By their amended summons the plaintiffs, Jon Gregory
Partridge and Linda Partridge, have brought proceedings in
the Administrative
Law Division of this Court against the Registrar, Building Disputes Tribunal as
first defendant and Amcon Constructions
Pty Limited as second defendant.  The
Minister for Fair Trading has been added as intervener in the proceedings
pursuant to s 44
of the <i>Consumer Claims Tribunals Act 1987</i>.  The orders
sought by the plaintiffs are the following:
<P>

<i>"1.	An order that the decision of 2.12.1997 of the Building Disputes
Tribunal be reviewed under section 12(b)(ii) of the Consumer
Claims Tribunal
Act 1987 on the grounds that in relation to the hearing and determination, the
appellant was denied natural justice;
and</i>
<P>

<i>2.	An order that the appellant be allowed until 15.1.1998 to make this
appeal."</i>
<P>

2  	No challenge has been made to any right of relief the plaintiffs
might otherwise have on the basis of delay in the commencement
of these
proceedings and accordingly the issue on this summons has been whether or not
grounds have been established to disturb the
decision of the Tribunal.
<P>

3  	The plaintiffs have not enjoyed the benefit of legal
representation before this Court and the second plaintiff, Linda Partridge,
has
appeared in person representing herself and her husband.  The Tribunal filed a
submitting appearance and Mr Sexton of counsel
has represented the second
defendant.  Mrs Gilmour of counsel has represented the intervener.
<P>

4  	No less than thirteen affidavits were sworn by the second
plaintiff.  Many of these were objectionable as to form and as to
content and a
great deal of the hearing time in this matter was taken up in ruling on
objections taken to the plaintiffs' affidavits.
 The second plaintiff was cross
examined.
<P>

5  	The notes made by the referee in the course of the proceedings
before the Tribunal were introduced into evidence and so too
were the referee's
reasons for her decision.  In addition, the exhibits placed before the referee
were tendered in this Court, as
was additional material from the file of the
Registry of Consumer Claims Tribunals pertaining to the plaintiffs' claim.
<P>

6  	The second defendant entered into a contract with the plaintiffs
to carry out building work for them in the construction of
residential premises
at 11 Burwood Street, Merewether.  The dispute arose over the plaintiffs' claim
that the work done by the second
defendant was defective in a number of
respects.  The claim as amended and presented by the plaintiffs before the
Tribunal sought
an order for the cost of rectification of the defective work in
an amount of $18,985.  The second defendant countered with a claim
for extras
for what it alleged was additional work required on the foundations by reason
of engineer's requirements and this claim
for extras amounted to $4686.25.
<P>

7  	The plaintiffs were largely unsuccessful before the Tribunal,
recovering only $280, but on the other hand the second defendant
was found to
be owed $4686.25 for the work which the referee found to have been extra work.
In the result the order of the Tribunal
required the plaintiffs to pay to the
second defendant the sum of $4406.25.
<P>

8  	By reason of s 34 of the <i>Consumer Claims Tribunals Act</i> an
order of a Tribunal <i>"is final and binding on all parties to a consumer claim
that is heard and determined by the Tribunal and no appeal lies in respect
of
an order of the Tribunal."</i>  As the section specifically recognises however,
relief may be granted pursuant to s 12 of the statute.  Section 12 provides:
<P>

<i>"(1)	Except as provided by subsection (2), a court of record has no
jurisdiction to grant relief or a remedy by way of:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	a judgment or order in the nature of prohibition, mandamus, certiorari
or other prerogative writ,</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	a declaratory judgment or order, or</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	an injunction,</i>
<P>

<i>in respect of a consumer claim heard and determined or to be heard or
determined by a tribunal in accordance with this Act or in respect
of any
ruling, order or other proceeding relating to such a claim.</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	A court is not precluded from granting relief or a remedy of a kind
referred to in subsection (1) if, in respect of a consumer
claim:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	a tribunal has given a ruling under section 26 or refused or failed to
give such a ruling after the jurisdiction of the tribunal
to hear and determine
the claim has been disputed by a party to the claim and the ground on which the
relief or remedy is sought
is that:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	the ruling was erroneous, or</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	the tribunal erred in refusing or failing to give the ruling after its
jurisdiction was disputed, or </i>
<P>

<i>(b)	a tribunal has made an order under section 30 and the ground on which
the relief or remedy is sought is that:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	the tribunal had no jurisdiction to make the order, or</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	in relation to the hearing or determination of the claim, a party to
the claim had been denied natural justice."</i>
<P>

9  	In the present case it is the plaintiffs' contention that they
are entitled to relief under s 12(2)(b)(ii).  It is to be observed
that s 17 of
the statute whilst providing for control and responsibility by the Tribunal of
its own procedures requires the Tribunal
to <i>"conform to the rules of natural
justice"</i> (s 17(1)).
<P>

10  	The nature of the relief available in this court from an order
of a tribunal constituted under the <i>Consumer Claims Tribunal Act 1987</i> is
limited.  It does not avail a party who feels aggrieved by a decision of a
tribunal to maintain that a decision was made against
the weight of evidence.
Rather, as s 12(2) of the statute recognises, there must be shown, provided the
tribunal had jurisdiction
to make the order made, that there was in relation to
the hearing or the determination a denial of natural justice.
<P>

11  	Section 23 of the <i>Consumer Claims Tribunal Act</i> allows for
a measure of informality in proceedings before a tribunal:
<P>

<i>"(1)	At the hearing of a consumer claim, evidence relevant to the
determination of the claim may be given orally or in writing.</i>
<P>

<i>(2)	If evidence at the hearing of a consumer claim is to be given orally, it
must be given on oath.</i>
<P>

<i>(3)	If evidence at the hearing of a consumer claim is to be given in
writing, it must be given either on oath or by statutory declaration,
as the
giver of evidence prefers.</i>
<P>

<i>(4)	A tribunal is not bound by the rules of practice or evidence and,
subject to subsections (2) and (3), can inform itself on any
matter in such
manner as it considers appropriate."</i>
<P>

12  	In his decision in <i>Carpet Fashion Pty Limited v Consumer
Claims Tribunal</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20ASC%2056%2d189" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) ASC 56-189</a> Ireland J considered the concept of
natural justice in its application to proceedings under the <i>Consumer Claims
Tribunal Act</i>.  In doing so his Honour cited the statement of principle by
Dr Allars in "Introduction to Australian Administrative Review".  I
refer to
his Honour's judgment at 57,919-57,920:
<P>

<i>"It is important in the instant case to direct the issues to the permissible
question.  The issue in the instant case is not whether
there was a decision
against the weight of evidence, for it is not the function of this Court to
review decisions made by referees
under the Act merely because it is contended
that a decision was made against the weight of evidence.  The instant issue is
whether
there was a denial of natural justice.</i>
<P>

<i>Dr M. Allars in Introduction to Australian Administrative Review (1990) at
236 conveniently states the principles of natural justice
or procedural
fairness as follows:-</i>
<P>

<i>`The three principles of procedural fairness are the hearing rule, the bias
rule and the no evidence rule.  The hearing rule, based
on the maxim audi
alteram partem, requires a decision-maker to give an opportunity to be heard to
a person whose interest will be
adversely affected by the decision.  The bias
rule, based on the maxim nemo debet esse in propria sua causa, requires a
decision-maker
to be disinterested or unbiased in the matter to be decided...
The no evidence rule, which has developed comparatively recently,
requires that
a decision be based upon logically probative evidence.'</i>
<P>

<i>As I understand the submission of counsel for the plaintiff he bases his
contention as to denial of natural justice upon the third
of these bases,
namely the no evidence rule.  However, I must confess to some uncertainty as to
the relevance of the Referee's comment
`It's only $2,485' to the question of
whether the plaintiff was denied natural justice.</i>
<P>

<i>Again I stress that the question is not whether the decision went against
the weight of evidence but only as to whether there was
no logically probative
evidence at all to support the conclusions of fact reached.  Only then will the
decision be open to review."</i>
<P>

13  	Mrs Gilmour referred to <i>Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v
Bond</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/33.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1990] HCA 33</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20170%20CLR%20321" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 170 CLR 321</a> and to dicta of Mason CJ at 356-357, referring to
statements in English cases in the context of judicial review of findings of
fact
which supported a <i>"no sufficient evidence test"</i>.  The Chief Justice
said:
<P>

<i>"On the other hand, there are statements in the English cases which support
a `no sufficient evidence' test in the context of judicial
review of findings
of fact:  see, for example, Reg v Governor of Brixton Prison; Ex parte Armah
[1968] AC 192, at pp 235, 257, but
cf pp 241, 263.  It remains to be seen
whether these statements convey any more than a `no probative evidence' test.
So far no occasion
has arisen to determine whether this is the case and, if so,
whether the statements are to be seen as expressing what is or should
be the
law of Australia on the topic.  There are also statements in the English cases
which suggest that findings and inferences
are reviewable for error of law on
the reasonably drawn from the primary facts:  Edwards (Inspector of Taxes) v
Bairstow</i> <i><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1955/3.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1955] UKHL 3</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1956%5d%20AC%2014" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1956] AC 14</a>, at p 36; Cooper v Stubbs  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1925%5d%202%20KB%20753" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1925] 2 KB 753</a> at p

Authority  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1949%5d%201%20KB%20462" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1949] 1 KB 462</a> at pp 471-472; Ashbridge Investments Ltd v Minister

at p 374.  Further, in Mahon v Air New Zealand [1984] AC 808 at p 821 the
Judicial Committee stated that natural justice requires
that `the decision to
make [a] finding must be based upon some material that tends logically to show
the existence of facts consistent
with the finding and that the reasoning
supportive of the finding, if it be disclosed, is not logically self
contradictory'.  These
statements may be traced back to the observations of
Diplock LJ in Reg v Deputy Industrial Injuries Commissioner; Ex parte Moore
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%201%20QB%20456" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1965] 1 QB 456</a> at p 488; see also Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs

appeal from a decision of Administrative Appeals Tribunal under the AAT Act).
The approach adopted
in these cases has not so far been accepted by this
Court."</i>
<P>

14  	Mrs Gilmour submitted that the requirement that the <i>"no
evidence rule"</i> called for a decision to be based upon logically probative
evidence was to state the effect of the rule too broadly in view of the
above
dicta.  I do not accept that submission.  In any event the above observations
were not directed to the requirements of natural
justice in the context of the
provisions of the <i>Consumers Claims Tribunals Act</i>, and what natural
justice requires may depend on the statute in question, so that there is a need
to consider the framework of the
particular legislation.  Thus in <i>Bond</i>,
Deane J said at 366:
<P>

<i>"As has often been said, the precise content of the obligation of a
statutory tribunal to act judicially or to observe the requirements
of natural
justice or procedural fairness may vary according to the statutory framework of
the particular proceedings."</i>
<P>

15  	In <i>Fintron Pty Limited v Registrar, Consumer Claims
Tribunal</i> (unreported, 16 December 1997) Graham AJ said at p 5:
<P>

<i>"The duty to accord natural justice is a duty to act fairly.  What the rules
of natural justice require in any particular case varies
according to the
circumstances and is to be determined, inter alia, by reference to the relevant
statutory provisions."</i>
<P>

16  	Once a tribunal under the <i>Consumer Claims Tribunals Act</i>
has jurisdiction, there is no appeal on the merits.  I respectfully agree with
Simpson J when she said in <i>Archcom Pty Limited v Consumer Claims
Tribunal</i> (unreported, 29 September 1995, at 7):
<P>

<i>"It is also important to bear in mind that there is no appeal on the merits
from the decision of a tribunal, and nor is there an appeal
on a question of
law."</i>
<P>

17  	Moreover, once a tribunal has jurisdiction to make an order
under s 30 of the statute, it has jurisdiction to err:  see <i>APA Insurance v
Charles</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%202%20NSWLR%20352" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 2 NSWLR 352</a> and <i>Archcom </i>(supra, at 9).
<P>

18  	For the purposes of the <i>Consumer Claims Tribunals Act</i>, I
accept that the principles of natural justice are those identified by Ireland J
in the <i>Carpet Fashion</i> case.  The requirement that a decision must be
based on logically probative evidence does not mean that the decision must
follow
the weight of the evidence.  Where there is evidence available to a
referee to support a finding of fact, provided it logically goes
to the proof
of that fact, there can be no denial of natural justice simply because in
making that finding the referee prefers such
supporting evidence rather than a
preponderance of contrary evidence.
<P>

19  	Against the background of the limited nature of the right of
challenge afforded by s 12(2)(b)(ii) of the <i>Consumer Claims Tribunal
Act</i>, I now consider in turn each of the many submissions advanced by the
second plaintiff in support of the contention that the plaintiffs
were denied
natural justice by the referee who determined the outcome of the proceedings
before the Tribunal.
<P>

20  	It was submitted that the plaintiffs were denied natural justice
because the referee arrived at various conclusions of fact,
which conclusions
were unsupported by logically probative evidence.  The second plaintiff, in
developing this submission, referred
to a number of passages in the reasons
expressed by the referee for her decision and I will deal with the various
submissions to
this effect in the order in which they were advanced.
<P>

21  	(i)	On p 9 of the reasons the following passage appears:
<P>

<i>"I find that the architectural plans which were provided by the claimant
provide details as to the depth to which excavations will
have to be made to
provide footings.  This information, I find, the respondent relied on in his
quotation.  </i><cite>These specific details are disclosed in the respondent's
quotation</cite><i>."</i>
<P>

22  	Mrs Partridge submitted that the sentence to which emphasis has
been added above amounted to a decision of fact unsupported
by logically
probative evidence.  Her submission in effect was that the referee should have
found that the second defendant had the
engineering drawings as well before
quoting.
<P>

23  	Mrs Partridge drew attention to a passage in the quotation under
the heading "<i>Concreter"</i> which, in referring to the "slabs", stated inter
alia:
<P>

<i>"Jointex to single skin walls F72 reinforcement..."</i>
<P>

24  	The second plaintiff then referred to the architectural plans
which referred to the floor slab as follows:
<P>

<i>"Floor slab F62 fabric..."</i>
<P>

25  	The second plaintiff submitted that it was necessary to go to
the engineering drawings to see a reference to F72 in respect
of the floor
slab.  Thus, it was argued, that the second defendant must have had the
engineering drawings when the quotation was
given.
<P>

26  	No doubt that was an argument that was available to the
plaintiffs in the proceedings before the referee, but I am not persuaded
by it
that the referee was compelled to make the finding which the plaintiffs sought
to have made.  The focus on those parts of the
evidence to which this
submission is directed is to ignore other evidence in the case, and in
particular the evidence given on behalf
of the builder.  The paragraph from the
referee's reasons to which this submission is directed was preceded by a
conclusion expressed
in this passage also on p 9:
<P>

<i>"Having considered the evidence presented by the parties, I am satisfied on
the balance of probabilities that the respondent was not
given the engineering
plans at the time of quoting."</i>
<P>

27  	In my opinion, that was a finding which was open to the referee
and I stress for the benefit of the plaintiffs that it is not
for this Court to
substitute the finding it would or may have made upon the same evidence for a
finding that the referee made.
<P>

28  	This first challenge fails.
<P>

29  	(ii)	On p 7 of the reasons, the referee said:
<P>

<i>"The success of the respondent's counter-claim depends largely on whether
the Tribunal accepts that the company was given the engineering
plans at the
time of quoting and whether the quote in question was based on those plans or
not."</i>
<P>

30  	Mrs Partridge submitted that the conclusion which the referee
reached as to when the engineering plans became available to
the builder was
not supported by logically probative evidence.  In developing that submission
Mrs Partridge referred to evidence
to indicate that the builder was aware of
the engineering requirements when the job was costed but the very same
difficulty confronts
the plaintiffs in arguing this ground as confronted them
with the first ground.  To advance the submission that there was logically
probative evidence that would have supported a contrary conclusion does not
mean that the referee was compelled to reach that conclusion
where there was
other evidence which she was entitled to accept which supported the builder's
case, and in this regard the evidence
supporting the builder's case included
the oral evidence of the builder which it was for the referee to assess as the
tribunal of
fact.
<P>

31  	This second ground of challenge cannot succeed.
<P>

32  	(iii)	On p 6 of the reasons of the referee, in addressing the
claim for the rear verandah frame, the referee concluded:
<P>

<i>"Having no specific quotation to rely on for this minor work, which would
involve no materials and less than one hour's work, I allow
thirty dollars
($30)."</i>
<P>

33  	The second plaintiff submitted that this conclusion was not
based upon logically probative evidence.  
<P>

34  	The second plaintiff drew attention to the evidence introduced
through the statutory declaration of a builder, Colin Hutchinson,
and that
declaration and the attached quotation for rectification work dealt with the
rear verandah work identifying a need to remove
the existing gutter and
downpipe, to trim all the rafters in a straight line and to install new fascia
and then re-install the existing
gutter and downpipe.  Provision was made also
for repainting.  There was no quotation for or expert evidence as to the cost
of only
trimming the rafters.  The referee determined that the claim for the
installation of the fascia was not established so that the referee
was left in
the position of having no evidence either as to the cost of the trimming which
the referee found ought to be provided
for nor as to the time such trimming
would take.  It was of course for the plaintiffs to prove their case.  How much
of the figure
of $692 advanced on behalf of the plaintiffs as being the cost of
all the work contemplated by Mr Hutchinson in relation to the back
verandah
related merely to trimming the rafters was not addressed in the plaintiffs'
evidence and I am quite unable to conclude that
in arriving at the allowance
made by the referee there was a denial of natural justice to the plaintiffs.
This ground of challenge
fails.
<P>

35  	(iv)	On p 4 of the referee's reasons the referee was addressing
a complaint about the width of the external stairs.  The referee
found that the
stairs were defective in certain respects and said:
<P>

<i>"The issue of stair width is perhaps not as straightforward in view of the
level of disagreement between the experts.  Having considered
their views and
those of the parties and in taking what I believe to be a common sense
approach, I find the difference between the
plans and that actually constructed
to be insignificant.</i>
<P>

<cite>Clearly the plans are not clear.  If they were, the experts themselves
would not be in dispute</cite><i>."</i>
<P>

36  	It was submitted by the second plaintiff that that finding was
not based on logically probative evidence.
<P>

37  	I cannot accept that submission.  The referee went on after the
passage underlined to say:
<P>

<i>"There are no details anywhere to be seen on the plans as to the specific
width of the stairs.  If a slide rule is applied, the stairs
appear to
represent a measurement of between 900 and about 1000 mm.  There is no way, in
view of the lack of detail in the plans,
to ascertain exact
measurements."</i>
<P>

38  	Consideration of the plans themselves justifies what the referee
said.
<P>

39  	Having considered what the second plaintiff had to say about
this ground of challenge and Mr Sexton's contrary submissions,
I am satisfied
that the referee was entitled to reach the conclusion expressed in the passage
here challenged.  This submission made
by Mrs Partridge fails.
<P>

40  	(v)	The next submission to the effect that the referee's
decision was not based upon logically probative evidence, concerns
the
driveway.  I propose to set out the referee's reasons concerning the driveway
in their entirety:
<P>

<i>"The claimant alleges that the driveway is not constructed according to
correct levels and that the box drain is in the wrong position.
 No expert
evidence or evidence of any kind has been produced by the claimant in support
of this claim.  There is nothing to suggest
that the driveway is defective in
any way.</i>
<P>

<i>The claimant has tendered a quotation from Mr Col Hutchinson to the value of
$4956.00 to remove the driveway and reconstruct.</i>
<P>

<i>The claimants have carriage of their own claim.  For it to succeed they must
establish the claim of [sic] the balance of probabilities.</i>
<P>

<i>The claimants have produced no evidence, this item must fail."</i>
<P>

41  	Mrs Partridge has submitted that the above conclusion involved a
denial of natural justice because it was not supported by
probative evidence.
I shall treat that submission broadly so as to regard it as a submission that
the referee ignored logically probative
evidence supporting the plaintiffs'
grievance.
<P>

42  	There was evidence which calls for consideration in respect of
this submission, consisting of the contract and specifications,
the plan,
photographs, the report from Craig's Building Advisory Services Pty Limited,
and a quotation from C. Hutchinson Constructions.
<P>

43  	It is clear from a consideration of the contract documents that
the builder undertook to construct a driveway and to construct
a box gutter
drain.  According to the plan of the architect the box gutter drain was to be
immediately below the balcony.
<P>

44  	The Craig report concludes on p 14:
<P>

<i>"The driveway box drain has also been positioned in a different location
than shown on plan.  The plan shows the drain alignment with
the front edge of
the north east corner balcony.  However the drain has been positioned
immediately adjacent to the garage roller
door."</i>
<P>

45  	There was a photo, poorly reproduced on p 15 of the exhibit
before this Court, that shows the drain just outside the garage
shutter.
<P>

46  	There was a quotation from the builder, C.H. Hutchinson
Constructions, dated 21 October 1997, quoting $4956 <i>"to rectify driveway
levels as shown on stamped plans"</i>.  This price, it would seem from the
detail of the quotation, contemplated the cost of removing the existing
driveway, altering levels
and relaying concrete.
<P>

47  	The referee was not correct in stating in her reasons (set out
above) that <i>there was no evidence </i><cite>of any kind</cite><i>"</i> and
that the claimants <i>"have produced </i><cite>no evidence</cite><i>"</i> in
relation to this head of claim.  That is clear having regard to the evidence
reviewed above.  If the architect's plan was relied
upon to evidence the level
of the driveway then what it showed was a slope down towards the front of the
house to the door edge of
the balcony but from that point on that the driveway
was to be level until it entered the garage.  Moreover, looking at the Craig
report, it identifies that the drain was positioned other than where suggested
on that plan.  So it is that there was evidence indicating
a departure from the
requirements of the contract.
<P>

48  	However it was submitted by both Mr Sexton and Mrs Gilmour that
the errors of expression in the referee's reasons to which
I have above
referred did not establish a denial of natural justice.  I was referred to the
decision of McInerney J in <i>Health Care Complaints Commission v McDonald</i>
(unreported, 4 November 1997).  That was a case involving challenge to a
finding of the Nurses' Tribunal.  His Honour there referred
to <i>Minister for
Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Liang</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20185%20CLR%20259" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 185 CLR 259</a> which involved
consideration of the role of judicial review from a delegate's assessment under
s 22AA of the <i>Immigration Act</i>, and said at 10-11:
<P>

<i>"The court set out the role of a reviewing court.  I believe in principle
that those comments apply to the task that befalls me in
this case.</i>
<P>

<i>It was said that when a reviewing court is reviewing an administrative
decision it should give the reasons for that decision a beneficial
construction.  The court referred with approval to Collector of Customs v
Pozzolanic (1993) 43 FCR 280 where the Full Court of the
Federal Court
discussed the practical restraints on judicial review.  It was said that a
court should not be `concerned with looseness
in the language... nor with
unhappy phrasing' of the reasons of an administrative decision-maker.  The
court said (at 287):</i>
<P>

<i>`The reasons for the decision under review are not to be construed minutely
and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception
of error.'</i>
<P>

<i>The majority judges consisting of Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ
went on to say (at 272):</i>
<P>

<i>`These propositions are well settled.  They recognise the reality that the
reasons of an administrative decision-maker are meant to
inform and not to be
scrutinised upon over-zealous judicial review by seeking to discern whether
some inadequacy may be gleaned from
the way in which the reasons are
expressed.'"</i>
<P>

49  	It was submitted that this Court should adopt the same approach
as was identified in <i>Liang, Pozzolanic</i> and <i>McDonald</i> in reviewing
the reasons for decision as expressed by the referee in this case.  I consider
there is merit in that submission and
that it is not for this Court to disturb
the referee's decision merely for loose expression.  In the passage above set
out from the
referee's reasons, the referee was correct to state that it was
for the plaintiffs to prove their claim <i>"on the balance of
probabilities"</i> and it seems to me, having regard to the way the claim was
presented before the referee, it was open to the referee to reject the
claim
concerning the drain and the driveway.  I have concluded that I should accept
the submissions advanced by Mr Sexton and Mrs
Gilmour to this effect, having
regard to the following:
<P>

(a)	In their claim form in the proceedings in the Tribunal, the claim was
identified as one directed to defective work.  The referee's
notes (Exhibit A)
at the outset record this as being the one issue raised by the plaintiffs.
There was no complaint expressed in
the form that the builder did not do the
work as contemplated by the contract documents, and in particular no complaint
was made
in the claim that the builder departed from the requirements of the
contract in relation to the location of the drain or the level
of the driveway.
The issues expressed in the claim concerned alleged defects in the manner in
which the work was done, not whether
the builder departed from stipulations of
the contract in where it placed the drain or how it addressed the level of the
driveway.
<P>

(b)	Section 31(1) of the <i>Consumer Claims Tribunal Act</i> required of the
second defendant that it <i>"make such orders, as in its opinion, will be fair
and equitable".</i>
<P>

(c)	The plaintiffs first complained of the placement of the drain in the course
of hearing before the referee, some three years
after the completion of the
building work.
<P>

(d)	The Craig report referred to the location of the drain but not to the
driveway level.  The Craig report did not address the
cost of doing work again
in strict accordance with the architect's plans.  Nor did the author of the
report address either issue,
that is either the drain location or the driveway
level, in his evidence.
<P>

(e)	The quotation from Hutchinson Constructions did not address the issue as to
why the work subject to the quotation should be
done.  There was no break-up of
the quotation for $4956, so the referee had no separate costing for the
relocation of the drain alone.
 To determine that the slope of the driveway
departed from the architect's plan depended upon an interpretation of the plan.
Certainly
the plan appears to show the drive as sloping down towards the house
to a point directly under the front of the verandah, and from
that point being
flat to the garage door, but there was no evidence to indicate any practical
problems either with the driveway or
the effectiveness of the drain where it
had been located.
<P>

(f)	The author of the quotation for the amount of $4956 gave no evidence before
the referee.  Section 23 of the statute provided
for the manner of giving
evidence.  Either it was to be given orally on oath, or, if in writing, by
statutory declaration.  The quotation
relied upon by the plaintiffs was not
supported by statutory declaration.
<P>

50  	With the above considerations in mind, it seems to me that it
was open to the referee to determine that the plaintiffs had
not satisfied her
it was fair and equitable to order the builder to pay for the cost of the work
covered by the quotation which was
not proved as required by s 23.
<P>

51  	Mrs Partridge submitted that the referee should have had a view
as she requested the referee to do.  A view would have assisted,
it was
submitted, in addressing any shortcomings in the plaintiffs' case on this
item.
<P>

52  	In my opinion that submission should be rejected.  Whilst a
referee may hold a view, and this may be a legitimate way of informing
a
tribunal on an issue, an unwillingness to conduct a view in this case could not
be regarded as a denial of natural justice.  It
must be borne in mind that the
statute under which the referee was operating is concerned to afford
expeditious and inexpensive process
for the resolution of disputes.  This was
quite a lengthy hearing and it does not seem to me that natural justice
demanded of this
referee that she attend upon a view to address shortcomings in
the presentation of the plaintiffs' case.  In any event, a view would
not have
addressed the absence of evidence as to how the drain and the driveway as
located and constructed were achieving their respective
purposes.
<P>

53  	Having reflected on the competing submissions concerning the
driveway and the drain, I am not persuaded that the referee's
decision in
relation to these items can be regarded as a denial of natural justice and the
plaintiffs' submissions in point accordingly
fail.
<P>

54  	(vi)	Passing to the next matter raised by Mrs Partridge, it was
submitted that the referee was in error in the manner in which
she addressed
the issue of "bowed windows" on p 6 of her report.  It was submitted that there
was error in the interpretation of
Mr Hutchinson's evidence and the
significance to be attributed to it in respect of timber shrinkage.
<P>

55  	The ultimate finding on the windows was expressed on p 7 in the
following passage:
<P>

<i>"Having considered the evidence in respect of the windows I cannot be
satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the respondent
did not allow 10
mm for wood shrinkage as he said he did.  Whilst I think that a builder clearly
is responsible for shrinkage and
must make an appropriate allowance for same he
cannot be held liable should the wood shrink more than what one would
reasonably expect.
 On the evidence I find that this is what has occurred in
the present circumstances.</i>
<P>

<i>In any event, on the evidence, all the windows still operate freely and the
bowing complained of is apparently less than one centimetre.
 This is hardly
significant and does not warrant the rectification work suggested by the
claimant."</i>
<P>

56  	Those findings were expressed after a review of the evidence and
in my opinion it simply cannot be said that in her approach
to this issue the
referee denied natural justice to the plaintiffs.  This submission fails.
<P>

57  	The next submission advanced by Mrs Partridge was that she was
prevented from presenting relevant evidence.  There can be no
question but that
if a party in proceedings before a tribunal is not afforded a reasonable
opportunity to present his or her case
that will amount to a denial of natural
justice.  The requirement of fairness demands that such an opportunity be
given, together
with an adequate opportunity to respond to the case presented
in opposition.
<P>

58  	Mrs Partridge drew attention to what occurred before the referee
on 25 August 1997 when the second defendant was called upon,
and referred in
particular to what was recorded on p 4 of the referee's notes, Exhibit A.  The
second defendant was critical of Mrs
Partridge and informed the referee that a
barrister had described Mrs Partridge as the most difficult she had ever dealt
with and
that she was vexatious and unfair.  This prompted Mrs Partridge to
write to the referee on 26 October 1997 (Annexure (d) to the affidavit
of 1 May
1998) and in that letter paragraph 6 was in these terms:
<P>

<i>"Ms Olsson said that I was the most difficult she'd dealt with.
Contradictory evidence - reasons for the decision - commercial tribunal
-
15.5.1997 - p 13, p 6, p 10, p 6 - all Ms Olsson's witnesses were
discredited."</i>
<P>

59  	Mrs Partridge argued that she was prevented from taking the
referee through that <i>"contradictory evidence"</i> before the hearing
concluded.  The earlier proceedings before the Commercial Tribunal were
proceedings between Mrs Partridge and
Building Services Corporation for which
latter body Ms Olsson had appeared in those earlier proceedings.  That tribunal
made findings
favourable to Mrs Partridge and was critical of Mr Murdoch of the
second defendant.  It is clear that the tribunal in those earlier
proceedings
had made an adverse finding as to Mr Murdoch's credibility.
<P>

60  	The findings of the earlier tribunal in relation to the
credibility of Mr Murdoch were not binding on the referee in the later
proceedings and Mrs Gilmour is correct in the submission made that the material
identified in para 6 of the letter of 26 October
and above set out was not
relevant to the proceedings before the referee.  The credibility of Mrs
Partridge on the one hand and of
Mr Murdoch on the other hand was not to be
determined by findings made by the tribunal earlier constituted for the
purposes of the
proceedings taken by Mrs Partridge against the Building
Services Corporation.
<P>

61  	In determining what happened before the referee on the hearing
on this matter, I am largely dependent upon a consideration
of the notes of the
referee (Exhibit A).  I am quite unable to determine, having considered those
notes, that the plaintiffs were
not given the opportunity to present relevant
evidence.  Indeed, I note that at the conclusion of the hearing on 27 October
1997,
according to the referee's notes, the referee told Mrs Partridge that she
needed to sit down and reflect on the claim and <i>"put it in some order"</i>.
The referee suggested, according to her notes, that <i>"perhaps w [Mr
Hutchinson] will assist her"</i>.  
<P>

62  	The submission I have identified in para 57 has not been made
good.
<P>

63  	Mrs Partridge next submitted that the referee refused to allow
relevant evidence.  Mrs Partridge complained that Mr Hutchinson
had been
required to wait outside the room where the proceedings were being conducted on
27 October 1997.  The complaint continued
that he was not allowed to be present
whilst Mr Murdoch gave evidence and addressed matter in Mr Hutchinson's report.
If it be the
fact that the referee required Mr Hutchinson to remain outside the
hearing room, I do not consider that that could be regarded as
amounting to a
denial of natural justice having regard to the relevant provisions of the
<i>Consumer Claims Tribunals Act: </i> see in particular ss 17 and 22.  In any
event it is clear that before proceedings concluded on 27 October Mr Hutchinson
was in the
hearing room.  There is a note at p 9 of the referee's notes,
Exhibit A:
<P>

<i>"C [Mrs Partridge] now has her witness [Mr Hutchinson] in the room."</i>
<P>

64  	When, as is indicated on p 10, the time allocated for the
hearing on 27 October was exhausted, it was then that the referee
suggested,
according to the notes I reviewed when considering the last ground argued by
Mrs Partridge, that Mrs Partridge should
reflect upon her case before the next
hearing date appointed and call in aid Mr Hutchinson if need be.
<P>

65  	I am not persuaded that there was any denial of natural justice
by the referee in relation to Mr Hutchinson's involvement in
this matter.  This
ground of challenge therefore fails.
<P>

66  	Mrs Partridge next submitted that the referee gave <i>"no weight
to estoppels"</i>.  Mrs Partridge argued that the second defendant was estopped
from making a claim for extras in association with the work required
by the
engineer's drawings because of correspondence that had passed between the
parties, and in particular the account from the
second defendant entitled
"Reconciliation" and dated 11 July 1994 and a further exchange of letters,
being the letter from Mrs Partridge
to the second defendant of 20 March 1995
and the response of 27 February 1997.  Mrs Partridge argued that the stated
balance outstanding
defined in the "Reconciliation" document of 11 July 1994
was paid and on 10 March 1995 Mrs Partridge wrote to the second defendant
denying any indebtedness to it but claiming to be owed the sum of $388.11.
That sum of money was paid to the plaintiffs by the second
defendant under
cover of 27 February 1997. 
<P>

67  	In these circumstances Mrs Partridge maintained that it was not
open to the second defendant to pursue the claim for extras
which was the
subject of the counter claim before the referee.
<P>

68  	The arguments which the plaintiffs based upon the exchange of
correspondence reviewed might well have found favour with the
referee but the
exchange of correspondence and the payment ultimately made by the second
defendant could not be regarded as giving
rise to an estoppel.  
<P>

69  	The referee dealt with the substance of the submission now under
consideration on p 9 of her reasons:
<P>

<i>"The respondent company says that it has never waived its right to payment
of the monies, although in attempts to settle the matter
(without prejudice) it
has offered a reduction of the amounts owing.  The respondent says that the
claimants have never agreed to
accept any of the offers so made.</i>
<P>

<i>The respondent company says that it paid the claimants the $388.11 owed in
good faith because the contract was a bill of quantities
and they wanted to do
the right thing.  The respondent says that it did not claim the monies
previously as they did not realise that
a claim could be lodged through the
Building Disputes Tribunal without the need of legal fees.  The respondent says
that with the
other stresses associated with this building job, the monies owed
for the footings was not a high priority and may indeed not have
been actively
sought had the claimants not lodged with the present claim, which the
respondent regards as vexatious."</i>
<P>

70  	It is plain from the decision of the referee that the
considerations he addressed in the above paragraphs involved her rejection
of
the arguments against the plaintiffs based upon the reconciliation account and
the subsequent correspondence.  Whilst the referee
could well have arrived at a
contrary decision on this point, the decision reached was not one which could
be regarded as involving
a denial of natural justice.
<P>

71  	Mrs Partridge next submitted that the decision reached by the
referee was so unreasonable that no reasonable tribunal of fact
could have
reached such a decision.
<P>

72  	This submission cannot succeed.
<P>

73  	It seems to me that there was evidence upon which the referee
could arrive at the decision which she reached.  It does not
avail the
plaintiffs, having regard to the nature of proceedings in this Court, to be
able to point to evidence which warranted a
contrary conclusion.  I have
earlier stated the relevant principles which govern the proceedings on this
summons.
<P>

74  	Mrs Partridge next submitted that the referee failed to follow s
31(2)(f) and s 31(3)(a) of the <i>Consumer Claims Tribunals Act</i>.
<P>

75  	I referred earlier to the requirement imposed upon a tribunal by
s 31(1) to make orders which in its opinion are fair and equitable.
 Section
31(2) provides, so far as is relevant to this submission:
<P>

<i>"(2)  	Without limiting subsection (1), when a tribunal is considering
whether or not to make an order or orders under section 30,
the following
factors are relevant, so far as they are material to the particular
circumstances of the case:</i>
<P>

<i>	.............</i>
<P>

<i>(f)	the conduct of the parties to the claim in relation to similar
transactions to which any of them has been a party."</i>
<P>

76  	Section 31(3)(a) provides:
<P>

<i>"Without limiting subsection (1), when a tribunal is considering whether or
not to make an order or orders under section 30, it is
appropriate for the
tribunal to take into account, so far as material to the particular
circumstances of the case:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	any code of practice for fair dealing prescribed under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p7" class="autolink_findacts">Part 7</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a>"</i>
<P>

77  	Mrs Partridge submitted that the referee did not heed the
conduct of the parties in the earlier appeal proceedings between
Mrs Partridge
as appellant and Building Services Corporation as respondent.  I referred to
these proceedings earlier in paras 59-60
of this judgment.  Those proceedings
did not enliven <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 31(2)(f)</a>, and in any event the findings of that tribunal
earlier constituted could not properly be used to assist the referee in
deciding
whether he should believe Mrs Partridge or Mr Murdoch.  This was
something the referee had to determine for herself.
<P>

78  	As to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p7" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 7</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a></i>, it was submitted that
it required the referee to regard the engineer's drawings as part of the
contract on which the price was quoted.
 Certainly the engineer's plans became
part of the contract, but the issue was whether the quotation was based upon
those plans at
the time the quotation was provided.  I do not accept the
submission that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p7" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 7</a> prevented the referee from treating the costs of
compliance with the engineer's drawings as an extra in respect of which the
second
defendant could claim against the plaintiffs.  The referee had to
consider all the evidence placed before her to determine whether
the counter
claim had been established.
<P>

79  	In my opinion there is nothing in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 31(2)(f)</a> and/or <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s31.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 31(3)(a)</a>
which leads to the conclusion that in her approach to this matter the referee
denied the plaintiffs natural justice.
<P>

80  	Mrs Partridge next submitted that the evidence presented by the
second defendant was given undue weight and that relevant evidence
was ignored.
In making this submission Mrs Partridge focussed in particular on that part of
the referee's decision in which the external
stairs issue was addressed.  Mrs
Partridge submitted that too much weight was given to the evidence of Victor
Topic and Rodney Douglas.
 The evidence from these sources was by way of
statutory declaration.  The statutory declaration from Mr Topic referred to his
twenty
years experience on which he based the opinions he expressed.  However,
Mr Douglas was silent as to his qualifications and experience
in his
declaration and Mrs Partridge submitted his declaration ought to have been
disregarded.
<P>

81  	The referee reviewed the evidence on the issue of the external
stairs in some detail at pp 2-4 of the reasons for the decision
reached.  That
she mentioned the declaration of Rodney Douglas in her review does not mean
that the referee gave his evidence undue
weight.  What weight the referee gave
to the evidence placed before her was, of course, for her to determine, and,
for reasons earlier
expressed, a submission to the effect that undue weight was
given to the evidence put forward by the second defendant cannot avail
the
plaintiffs here because of the limited nature of the relief available under s
12 of the <i>Consumer Claims Tribunals Act</i>.
<P>

82  	This submission also fails.
<P>

83  	Finally, it was submitted that the referee had no jurisdiction
to entertain the second defendant's counterclaim for the extra
cost of the
footings.
<P>

84  	Mrs Partridge relied upon s 10(3) of the <i>Consumer Claims
Tribunals Act</i> which provides as follows:
<P>

<i>"(3)	A tribunal does not have jurisdiction in respect of a consumer claim
(not being a claim referred to in subsection (3A)) if:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	in the case of a consumer claim relating to goods or services that have
been supplied to or for the claimant, the date on which
the supply was made or,
if made in instalments, the date on which the supply was last made,</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	in the case of a consumer claim relating to goods or services which are
required under a contract to be supplied to or for the
claimant on or by a
specified date or within a specified period but which have not been so
supplied, the date on or by which the
supply was required under the contract to
be made, or</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	in the case of a consumer claim relating to:</i>
<P>

<i>(i)	a contract for the supply of goods or services to which neither
paragraph (a) or (b) applies, or</i>
<P>

<i>(ii)	a collateral contract,</i>
<P>

<i>	the date on which the contract was entered into,</i>
<P>

<i>was more than 3 years before the date on which the claim was lodged in
accordance with section 13 of this Act or section 13 of the
repealed
Act."</i>
<P>

85  	Since the work was completed by December 1993 it was submitted
that time for the making of a claim by the second defendant
expired in December
1996.  Alternatively, the extra cost of the foundations was first raised in
writing as being a variation on 28
June 1994 and if that be the date from which
time began to run against the second defendant, the time for pursuing a claim
expired
in June 1997.  It was not until after the plaintiffs lodged their claim
on 2 July 1997 that the counterclaim was pursued.
<P>

86  	Mr Sexton conceded that had the second defendant wanted to
institute proceedings by way of claim for the extra cost of the
footings it
could have done so by lodging a claim under the <i>Consumer Claims Tribunals
Act 1987</i>.  Had it done so, it would seem that the limitation period under s
10(3) would be relevant.  However, the second defendant did not
lodge any such
claim.
<P>

87  	This submission advanced by Mrs Partridge warrants attention to
the framework of the Act.  There is no provision to which I
have been referred
which is directed at the raising of a cross claim or a counterclaim.  However,
what the statute does contemplate
is that a tribunal constituted under the Act
can have regard to what is considered fair and equitable in making any orders
on a claim
brought by a consumer.  Circumstances may warrant the making of an
order that requires the person who has brought the claim before
the tribunal to
make a payment to the person against whom the claim has been brought.  I refer
in this regard to s 31(1) and to s
30(2), and I now set out those provisions.
Section 31(1) provides:
<P>

<i>"31.(1)	When making an order or orders under section 30, a tribunal must
make such orders as, in its opinion, will be fair and equitable
to all the
parties to the claim."</i>
<P>

88  	Section 30(2) provides:
<P>

<i>"In determining a consumer claim wholly or partly in favour of a respondent
to the claim, a tribunal may make such one or more of
the following orders as
it considers appropriate:</i>
<P>

<i>(a)	an order dismissing the claim or a part of the claim,</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	</i><cite>an order that requires the claimant to pay to the respondent a
specified sum of money</cite><i>,</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	an order that requires the claimant to return to the respondent
specified goods which are in the possession or under the control
of the
claimant, whether the property in the goods has passed or not."</i>
<P>

89  	It seems to me, having regard to the way the relevant provisions
of the statute have been expressed, that s 10(3) did not prevent
the referee
from making the order which was made concerning the claim for extras.  That
order was made in dealing with the plaintiffs'
claim which was instituted by
the filing in the prescribed form of a claim form on 2 July 1997.  That claim
was not the subject of
any challenge to the Tribunal's jurisdiction under s
10(3).  Once that claim was before the tribunal, s 31(1) required of the
referee
that orders be made such as were in the opinion of the referee fair and
equitable, and s 30(2)(b) gave the referee jurisdiction to
make an order, in
determining the plaintiffs' claim, that the plaintiffs pay a specified sum of
money to the second defendant.  Indeed,
it is clear from s 30(2) that if a
claim lodged with the tribunal fails the tribunal may nevertheless not only
make an order dismissing
that claim but also make an order that requires the
claimant to pay a specified sum of money to the respondent.
<P>

90  	Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the referee did have
jurisdiction to make the order which was made, requiring the plaintiffs
to pay
to the second defendant the sum specified in the referee's decision.
<P>

91  	Mrs Partridge regarded the referee as being biased.  That
underlies a number of the submissions urged upon this Court.  It
is difficult
to appreciate precisely what happened during the course of what was a
relatively lengthy hearing before the referee.
 For obvious reasons this Court
has no transcript.  However, I have been asked to have regard to the referee's
notes.  They are extensive
notes and they were taken on the various hearing
dates, 25 August 1997, 22 September 1997, 27 October 1997 and 24 November 1997.
The original notes are handwritten but a typescript has been provided and the
typescript exceeds twelve pages.  I have considered
those notes and they do not
give rise in my mind to any concern that the referee may have been other than
fair and even-handed in
her approach to the task she faced.
<P>

92  	The notes indicate that there were exchanges between Mrs
Partridge and the referee.  For instance, on 25 August 1997 the referee
has
recorded (and this appears on the typed version at the foot of p 3):
<P>

<i>"I point out to [the plaintiff] that time was allowed on this occasion so
that she could complete evidence, it is not good enough
to not be ready.  I say
this is a great inconvenience to [the second defendant]  [The plaintiff] says
this is abuse.  I say to [the
second defendant] Do you see me abusing [the
plaintiff] - they say no..."</i>
<P>

93  	Then later on p 5 of the typescript, there is recorded:
<P>

<i>"[the plaintiff] is difficult to control</i>
<P>

<i>Told me I `abused her' when I simply asked her to ensure that she has her
evidence in order as it is an inconvenience to [the second
defendant] and the
Tribunal</i>
<P>

<i>I referred to her as `madam' and she said `see, there you go again'.  At
another time she said `I see you have great animosity towards
me.'</i>
<P>

<i>I explained that I tried to be fair to all parties and this was what she
objected to the names that [the second defendant] referred
to her as.</i>
<P>

<i>I said `well you said I abused you, I take exception to that'</i>
<P>

<i>[The plaintiff] says `I don't think I said that!'</i>
<P>

<i>I asked [the second defendant] what was said and they confirmed that [the
plaintiff] accused me of abusing her..."</i>
<P>

94  	In the middle of p 7 there is recorded the following:
<P>

<i>"I asked [the plaintiff] if she had a problem with the manner in which I
conducted these proceedings?  No, she says.  Are you sure?
 Yes I am.  I
stressed </i><cite>AGAIN</cite><i> that I am trying to be fair to both
sides..."</i>
<P>

95  	Then on p 9 of the typescript the following appears:
<P>

<i>"[The plaintiff] began to start her evidence again</i>
<P>

<i>I pointed out she had 4 hours to give her evidence</i>
<P>

<i>The opportunity now was for [the plaintiff] to answer the claim..."</i>
<P>

96  	If the referee's notes invite the inference, as in the above
extracts they may, that the referee became irritated during the
hearing with
Mrs Partridge that could not of itself warrant a conclusion that the referee
was biased:  see, for instance, the dicta
of Meagher JA in <i>Galea v Galea</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2019%20NSWLR%20263" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 19 NSWLR 263</a> at 283-284.
<P>

97  	In <i>Galea</i> Kirby A-CJ, as he then was, acknowledged that
concern about the efficient conduct of proceedings may warrant intervention by
a tribunal:
 see the judgment at 279.
<P>

98  	There are indications in the referee's notes of an endeavour to
be even-handed.  For instance at the conclusion of the notes
for 27 October
1997 (p 10 of the typescript) the following appears:
<P>

<i>"I said we really need to stop now.  [the plaintiff] needs to sit down and
reflect on the claim and may be put it in some order. 
Perhaps [the plaintiffs'
witness] will assist her.  I said it looks like we need another hearing, I am
sorry.</i>
<P>

<i>I asked [the second defendant] to wait in the room while [the plaintiff]
packed up her things, as I did not wish to be left in the
room with one
party."</i>
<P>

99  	Then on 24 November 1997 it is recorded that Mrs Partridge
wanted to amend her claim as foreshadowed in her letter of 4 November
1997.
The second defendant objected to the proposed amendments but the amendments
were allowed.  The typescript of the referee's
notes records:
<P>

<i>"[The plaintiff] wants to amend claim</i>
<P>

<i>letter on file</i>
<P>

<i>has been forwarded to [second defendant] also</i>
<P>

<i>[second defendant] has objection</i>
<P>

<i>I say I will allow the amendment as the issues (apart from driveway) have
all been referred to previously</i>
<P>

<i>[plaintiff] invited to give evidence."</i>
<P>

100  	Ultimately the test concerning bias in a tribunal is that
expressed in <i>Webb v The Queen</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/30.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 30</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%2d94%29%20181%20CLR%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993-94) 181 CLR 41.</a>  In their joint
judgment in that case Mason CJ and McHugh J said:
<P>

<i>"When it is alleged that a judge has been or might be actuated by bias, this
Court has held that the proper test is whether fair-minded
people might

The Court has applied the same test to a Commissioner of the Australian

The Court has
specifically rejected the real likelihood of bias test (Reg v Watson (1976) 136
CLR at pp 261-262).
 The principle behind the reasonable apprehension or
suspicion test is that it is of `fundamental importance that justice should
not
only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done' (R v
Sussex Justices, Ex parte Mc Carthy  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1924%5d%201%20KB%20256" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1924] 1 KB 256</a> at p 259, per Lord Hewart
CJ; Re JRL; Ex parte CJL (1986) 161 CLR at pp 351-352)."</i>
<P>

101  	Applying that test, and having regard to the behaviour of the
referee, particularly as reflected in the notes which were taken
during the
hearing, it does not seem to me that fair-minded people would reasonably
apprehend or suspect that the referee had prejudged
or might prejudge the
case.
<P>

102  	The plaintiffs have failed to establish any basis for the
intervention of this Court under s 12 of the <i>Consumer Claims Tribunals
Act</i>.  
<P>

103  	Accordingly the summons is dismissed.
<P>

104  	This leaves the question of costs.
<P>

105  	The parties were invited to address me on costs.  The second
defendant through Mr Sexton submitted that in the event that
the summons was
dismissed the plaintiffs should be ordered to pay its costs.  Mrs Partridge did
not contend to the contrary.  It
seems to me since the plaintiffs have failed
to obtain the relief sought on the summons by which they brought the second
defendant
here they should be ordered to pay the second defendant's costs of
the proceedings before this Court.  I propose to make an order
to that
effect.
<P>

106  	Mrs Gilmour submitted that the plaintiffs should also be
ordered to pay the costs of the Minister for Fair Trading arising
from the
intervention in this matter.  The plaintiffs did not nominate the Minister as a
party in these proceedings; rather the Minister
intervened pursuant to s 44 of
the <i>Consumer Claims Tribunals Act</i>.  This the Minister was plainly
entitled to do, but the question arises as to whether it is just that the
plaintiffs should be ordered
to pay the Minister's costs in the circumstances
of this case.
<P>

107  	As the hearing has been conducted the submissions advanced on
behalf of the Minister have been in sympathy with those advanced
on behalf of
the second defendant.  There has been no conflict between the second defendant
and the Minister in the manner in which
the relief sought by the plaintiffs on
their summons has been opposed.
<P>

108  	I was however asked to consider four affidavits, only in the
event that I came to the conclusion that the plaintiffs' summons
should be
dismissed.  After I reached that conclusion I turned to consider the affidavits
to which my attention was invited.  Those
affidavits were the following:
<P>

(a)	affidavit of Paul Murdoch sworn 20 April 1998;
<P>

(b)	affidavit of Paul Murdoch sworn 29 June 1998;
<P>

(c)	affidavit of Susan Murdoch sworn 29 June 1998;
<P>

(d)	affidavit of Susan Murdoch sworn 6 November 1998.
<P>

109  	With the exception of the first of those affidavits which I
have identified, the remaining three affidavits were prepared
by the Crown
Solicitor as the solicitor for the Minister.  The thrust of the affidavits, if
this can be so shortly summarised, is
that the deponents contended that the
referee had given both the plaintiffs and the second defendant a fair hearing.

<P>

110  	Having regard to the nature of the complaints made by the
plaintiffs, it was submitted by Mrs Gilmour that it was appropriate
for those
affidavits to be prepared by the Crown Solicitor and for this Court to have the
benefit of representation on behalf of
the Minister. 
<P>

111  	Having regard to the nature of the complaints made by the
plaintiffs, it was submitted by Mrs Gilmour that it was appropriate
for those
affidavits to be prepared by the Crown Solicitor and for this Court to have the
benefit of representation on behalf of
the Minister.  Whilst there is merit in
this submission, it was no doubt apparent to the Minister that the second
defendant was resisting
the relief sought in the summons, and indeed Paul
Murdoch's affidavit of 20 April 1998 was prepared by the solicitor for the
second
defendant.  On the hearing before this Court the second defendant was
represented by very experienced counsel and no doubt appropriate
inquiry of the
second defendant's solicitors before the hearing would have revealed that this
was going to be the case.  It seems
to me, having reflected on the competing
submissions and all the circumstances of this case, that the costs of the
Minister ought
not to be visited upon the plaintiffs.
<P>

112  	In these circumstances I do not propose to make the costs order
sought by Mrs Gilmour.
<P>

113  	The formal orders of the Court then are as follows:
<P>

1.	The summons is dismissed:
<P>

2.	I order the plaintiffs to pay the second defendant's costs of the
proceedings in this Court;
<P>

3.	The application that the plaintiffs pay the costs of the intervener is
refused.
