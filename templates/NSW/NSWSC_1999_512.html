<b><u>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

1	Arbitration proceedings between the Plaintiff, Nell Oh, and the Defendant,
Kenneth Alan Cox, commenced by way of Notice of Dispute
dated 6 January 1997,
pursuant to the terms of a building contract between the Plaintiff and the
Defendant for the renovation of
a house at 5 Wolseley Crescent, Point Piper.
The dispute concerned whether the Defendant had wrongfully repudiated the
building contract.
 The Defendant had also brought a cross-claim against the
Plaintiff for damages for loss of the contract and for particular losses
suffered by the Defendant through breaches of the contract allegedly committed
by the Plaintiff prior to rescission. 
<P>

2	The sole arbitrator in the matter held a preliminary conference on 17 March
1997. The arbitration hearing commenced on 17 November
1997. 
<P>

3	On 2 December 1997, the Arbitrator sent out his first interim award which
dealt with a number of preliminary questions of law
and set out the questions
to be dealt with by the parties in submissions on the question of liability,
which was to be separately
determined.  The first interim award did not deal
with the issue of costs.
<P>

4	The second interim award, which concerned the repudiation of the building
contract, was sent out on 6 June 1998. The Arbitrator
found that the Defendant
had wrongfully repudiated the building contract.  The award further provided
that the issue of costs was
to be determined following submissions at the
conclusion of the matter.  
<P>

5	The second interim award was received by the Plaintiff's solicitors on 9 June
1998 and was explained to the Plaintiff on or about
12 June 1998. 
<P>

6	On 15 June 1998,  the Arbitrator advised the parties by letter of a
Directions Conference set for 23 June 1998 in order that a
timetable for the
hearing on the issue of quantum of damages could be devised.  The Conference
was delayed at the request of the
Plaintiff's solicitors until 7 July 1998.
Before the Conference, on 29 June 1998, the Plaintiff had instructed counsel
acting on
her behalf to make an application for the costs of the interim awards
at the Conference on 7 July. However, on 7 July, the Plaintiff's
solicitors
requested a further adjournment until 15 July 1998 on the basis that there was
new law relating to the Arbitrator's orders
and that the Plaintiff required
time to prepare an affidavit and submissions in support of her costs
application. The Plaintiff was
directed to serve affidavits and submissions by
13 July 1998, a direction with which the Plaintiff complied. 
<P>

7	At the Conference of 15 July 1998, the Defendant's cross-claim was dismissed.
Counsel for the Plaintiff made an application for
an award of costs in favour
of the Plaintiff in respect of the first and second interim awards. It was
conceded by the Defendant
that the Arbitrator had the power to make such an
award, however it was argued that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a> of the Act required an application
for costs to be made within 14 days of the publication of the relevant award.

<P>

8	As a result of the Defendant's objection to the costs application, and on the
motion of counsel for the Plaintiff, the Directions
Conference was stood over
to enable the Plaintiff to move the Court for orders to extend time for the
interim costs application pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48(1)</a> of the Act.  The Plaintiff
requested a further adjournment due to the unavailability of Senior Counsel.
The adjournment was consented
to and the matter was again stood over.
<P>

9	The plaintiff filed a Summons in this Court seeking the orders set out below,
the matter being stood over generally, with liberty
to restore, pending the
outcome of the Summons:
<P>

	1. An order pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Arbitration Act 1984</a>
(NSW)</i> (`the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>') extending the time in which the Plaintiff may seek an
award for costs in respect of the interim awards made in her favour in the
arbitration proceedings presently pending between the Plaintiff and the
Defendant.
<P>

	2. An order that the Defendant pay the cost of these proceedings on a
party/party basis should these proceedings be unopposed,
but should the
Defendant oppose these proceedings, that Plaintiff's costs of these proceedings
be awarded against Defendant on an
indemnity basis;
<P>

	3. Further alternative relief as the Court thinks fit.
<P>

10	Subsequent to the hearing before this court, the solicitors for the
Plaintiff requested the opportunity to make further submissions
on the matter
of alternative orders as sought in paragraph 3 of the Summons, should the Court
decline to make the order in paragraph
1, extending the time for an interim
costs application, and foreshadowed the Plaintiff would seek a declaration that
the provisions
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Arbitration Act 1984</a> ("the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>")
would not prevent the Plaintiff applying for, and being awarded, in the
arbitrator's final award, her costs in respect of the second
interim award.

<P>

11	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 48(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> provides as follows: 
<P>

	"<b>Extension of Time</b>
<P>

	<b>48(1) </b>Subject to subsection (3), the Court shall have power on the
application of a party to an arbitration agreement or an arbitrator or
umpire
to extend the time appointed by or under this <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> or fixed by the agreement or
by an order under this section for doing any act or taking any proceeding in or
in relation to an arbitration.
<P>

	<b>(2) </b>The Court may make an order under this section although an
application for the making of the order was not made until after the expiration
of the time appointed or fixed for doing the act or taking the proceeding.
<P>

	<b>(3) </b>An order shall not be made under this section extending the time
within which arbitration proceedings might be commenced unless:
<P>

	(a) the Court is satisfied that in the circumstances of the case undue
hardship would otherwise be caused; and 
<P>

	(b) the making of the order would not contravene the provision of any
enactment limiting the time for the commencement of arbitration
proceedings.
<P>

12	The arbitrator's power to award costs is set out in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, the
relevant subsections of which are set out below:
<P>

	"<b>Costs</b>
<P>

	<b>34. (1)</b> Unless a contrary intention is expressed in the arbitration
agreement, the costs of the arbitration (including the fees and expenses
of the
arbitrator or umpire) shall be in the discretion of the arbitrator or umpire,
who may:
<P>

	(a) direct to and by whom and in what manner the whole or any part of those
costs shall be paid;
<P>

	(b) tax or settle the amount of costs to be so paid or any par of those costs;
and 
<P>

	(c) award costs to be taxed or settled as between party and party or as
between solicitor and client.
<P>

	<b>....... </b>
<P>

	<b>(4) </b>If no provision is made by an award with respect to costs of the
arbitration, a party to the arbitration agreement may, within 14
days of the
publication of the award, apply to the arbitrator or umpire for directions as
to the payment of those costs, and thereupon
the arbitrator or umpire shall,
after hearing any party who wishes to be heard, amend the award by adding to it
such directions as
the arbitrator or umpire may think proper with respect to
costs of the arbitration."
<P>

13	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/index.html#p72a" class="autolink_findacts">Part 72A</a> r12(1) SCR requires an arbitrator to make an interim award dealing
with all questions of liability and the relief to be granted 
without an
accompanying order for costs to allow both parties to make submissions on the
issue of costs:
<P>

	"<b>R12  </b>(1) In arbitration proceedings the arbitrator shall, unless the
parties otherwise request, make an interim award dealing with all
questions of
liability and the relief to be granted and, before making any provision in an
award with respect to the costs of the
arbitration, give the parties an
opportunity to be heard on the question of the costs of the arbitration."
<P>

14	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 23</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> permits an interim award, which by implication permits
an award dealing with any aspect of the arbitration. 
<P>

15	The word "award" in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a> also means an interim award and therefore an
arbitrator has power to make a costs award in relation to an interim award
(<i>Holiday Villages (Australia) Pty Ltd v Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd (Giles J,
9 April 1998, unreported)</i>).  
<P>

16	The reference to "publication" in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a> can only to refer to the date on
which the party wishing to "apply" receives notice of the award as contended in
<i>Jacobs, </i><cite>Commercial Arbitration Law and Practice</cite><i>, para
[32.320]</i>.  The interpretation of the word "apply" seems to be one which
refers to the date on which notice of the application is given, rather
than the
date on which the issue is actually argued before the arbitrator and in that
respect I adopt the contention to that effect
in <i>Jacobs</i>.  
<P>

17	In relation to timing, therefore, and based on the above guidelines to
interpreting <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a>, a costs application should have been made by the
Plaintiff by 17 December 1997 in respect of the first interim award (received
by
the Plaintiff's solicitors on 3 December 1997), and by 23 June 1998 in
respect of the second interim award (received by the Plaintiff's
solicitors on
9 June 1998).
<P>

18	The essence of the Plaintiff's argument was that the time for the making of
the interim costs application should be extended
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48(1)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, because otherwise the Plaintiff would lose her right to costs in respect
of the interim awards completely. 
<P>

19	This argument was based on the Plaintiff's understanding of the
interpretation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> in the decision of Giles J in <i>Holiday
Villages</i>. In <i>Holiday Villages</i>, an interim award on a discrete issue
had been made by an arbitrator in favour of Thiess, Holiday Villages having
made a Calderbank
offer to Thiess in respect of the whole of the claim.  The
question that arose was whether or not the arbitrator had the power to
award
costs of the interim award on the discrete issue until an interim award dealing
with <i>all</i> questions of liability and the relief to be granted had been
made and the parties had been given an opportunity to be heard on the
costs of
the arbitration.  His Honour held that if a party to an arbitration wanted to
protect itself from costs consequences, an
offer of settlement should be made
in respect of the subject matter of the interim award itself, rather than in
respect of the whole
arbitration.  The Plaintiff referred to the following
passage of the  judgment of Giles J at pps.11-12:
<P>

	"The core power to award costs is found in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4).</a>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 34(4)</a> recognises
that an award may include a costs award, but provides that if it does not
include a costs award a party may immediately
apply for directions as to the
payment of "<i>the costs of the arbitration</i>". The language of directions is
explained by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(1)(a)</a>, and in these reasons I refer to a costs award.  The
arbitrator must then make a costs award by amending the award.  By force of
the
definition, "<i>award</i>" in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a> includes an interim award, and the
reference in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a> to the costs of the arbitration must be to the costs in
relation to the award or the interim award, as the case may be.  Thus far,
therefore, an arbitrator has power to make a costs award in relation to an
interim award: indeed, he may be required to do so pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4).</a>
<P>

	The effect of r12(1) is that an arbitrator shall not include in his award as
to liability and relief any provision with respect
to the costs of the
arbitration, but must first make an interim award and then hear the parties as
to costs.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 34(4)</a> will always apply, because the award to which it
refers can not make provision with respect to the costs of the arbitration.
But
r12(1) does not give a different meaning to "<i>the costs of the
arbitration</i>".  It means the costs in relation to the interim award to which
it refers, which may be concerned with all claims the subject of
the
arbitration (so that the interim award precedes an award) or with some only of
the claims the subject of the arbitration (so
that the interim award precedes
an interim award).  The words "<i>all questions of liability and the relief to
be granted</i>" refer to liability and relief on the claims with which the
award or interim award will deal. Nothing in r12(1) cuts down an arbitrator's
power to make a costs award in relation to an interim award."
<P>

20	His Honour continued at p.14:
<P>

	"A respondent might go badly on the interim award and suffer a costs award, go
well on the remaining claims and keep the claimant's
overall recovery below the
amount of a global offer of compromise, but be left with a greater cost burden
than warranted because
the earlier costs award must stand; the risk can not
effectively be dealt with by requesting the arbitrator to defer the costs
award,
because the arbitrator can not be told of the global offer of
compromise.  In practice, however, an interim award does not come unexpectedly.
The parties have the opportunity to make offers of compromise specific to the
claims the subject of the interim award, and if a party
were disadvantaged it
would be because the party did not, in the light of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(6)</a> understood in the
manner earlier described, make a specific offer of compromise. It may also be
that the Court's ability to dispense
with compliance with any of the
requirements of the Rules would enable it to make an order whereby the
arbitrator could be told of
the global offer of compromise, in support of a
request that he defer the costs award."
<P>

21	Counsel for the Plaintiff relied on <i>Doran Constructions Pty Limited v
Health Administration Corporation of New South Wales (Rolfe J, 2 September
1994, unreported)</i> in which it was held by Rolfe J at p.23:
<P>

	"In my opinion the terms used in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> have been imported into the rules and
"Award" in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> is defined as including "an Interim Award".  It was further
submitted that the time for challenging an Interim Award does not arise
until a
final award is made. I reject this submission on the language of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, and
for the reason that an Interim Award may be the final award."
<P>

22	It was submitted by counsel for the Plaintiff that the  interpretation of
Giles J as to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a> and Rolfe J's comments on the nature of an interim award
necessarily meant that a party could not, at the end of a matter, ask for
costs
in an interim award any more than that party could appeal against the interim
award when the whole matter was over.  It was
submitted, therefore, that if an
application for costs in respect of an interim award was not made within the
time limit imposed
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a>, the Plaintiff's entitlement to those costs would
be lost, and therefore the Court should extend time pursuant to its power in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> to ensure that this entitlement is not lost forever. 
<P>

23	Further support for the Plaintiff's interpretation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a> is provided by
the Queensland Supreme Court decision in <i>Re J.W. Armstrong Constructions Pty
Ltd v Council of the Shire of Cook (White J, 25 February 1994,
unreported)</i>), in which White J held:
<P>

	"It seems to me that the approach of the arbitrator was correct that the
question of costs in relation to the interim award, based
as it was on agreed
statements of fact and formulated questions of law, should be dealt with and
not left to the outcome of the arbitration."
<P>

24	Counsel for the Defendant's preliminary point was that the arbitrator in
this present case had reserved the question of costs
until the end of the
matter, and it was submitted that this constituted a "provision by an award
with respect to costs" in accordance
with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4).</a>  It was submitted that an
award making "provision" for costs did not necessarily mean that costs had been
awarded in favour of one
party or another. Therefore, since an application
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a> is dependent on "no provision" with respect to costs having been
made, it was argued that the Plaintiff was precluded from applying
for an
interim costs order pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4).</a>
<P>

25	In addition, the Defendant disputed the Plaintiff's interpretation of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4).</a> It was argued that the wording of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a>  of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> did not prevent
the Plaintiff from having the question of costs dealt with at the conclusion of
the matter.  It was submitted that
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(1)</a> effectively gives the arbitrator the
opportunity to deal with costs at the end of the case, thus an award of costs
in respect of
an interim award would be able to be dealt with at that time.
Further, there was nothing in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a> to prevent the arbitrator saying, "I
direct payment of costs to be determined after the hearing," which would be
consistent with
the interpretation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a> that the issue of costs in
respect of an interim award need not necessarily be dealt with straight away in
order that an entitlement
to costs continues.
<P>

26	In response to this argument, counsel for the Plaintiff referred to the
transcript of the Directions Conference of 15 July 1998.
 It was submitted that
counsel for the Defendant had, at the Directions Conference, effectively told
the arbitrator that the Plaintiff
had "blown" her right to seek an order for
costs for the interim award for all time (p.6, line 20 ff.).  Therefore, it was
submitted
that counsel for the Defendant could not now argue that the
Plaintiff's interpretation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a> was misconceived.
<P>

27	Furthermore, the Plaintiff argued that the Defendant could not argue both
that "provision" had been made for costs and that the
application for a costs
award was out of time because these two arguments were mutually exclusive. 
<P>

28	The question of whether the Court should exercise its discretion and extend
time pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48(1)</a> will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each
case.  Some of the discretionary matters to be taken into account are (refer
<i>Jacobs, paras [45.340]-[45.420]</i>):
<P>

	(a) Delay in bringing an application for relief - a deliberate delay will
militate against the applicant;
<P>

	(b) The strength of the applicant's claim, although the Court should not
necessarily endeavour to form a view of the chances of
the applicant's
success;
<P>

	(c) Whether the applicant can still litigate the claim if time is not
extended;
<P>

	(d) Whether there was a deliberate disregard of the limitation provision by
the applicant;
<P>

	(e) Whether the applicant has litigation pending in another jurisdiction;
<P>

	(f) Whether there was a misunderstanding about the existence of the
time-barring clause or whether the respondent's conduct misled
the applicant as
to the nature of the time-barring clause;
<P>

	(g) The degree of fault on the part of the applicant leading to the claim
being time-barred.
<P>

29	In <i>Doran Constructions</i> (supra) Rolfe J outlined the ingredients of a
successful application to extend time under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48(1)</a> at p.23:
<P>

	(a) explanation for delays;
<P>

	(b) a substantial point to be argued;
<P>

	(c) demonstration of injustice if the applicant is prevented from arguing the
point.
<P>

30	His Honour also stated at p.22:
<P>

	"It seems to me that one must also have regard to the requirement that,
generally speaking, proceedings under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> should be determined in
accordance with the obvious intendment of it to bring about, save in
exceptional circumstances, a final determination
of matters as between the
parties in conformity with their agreement to submit to arbitration."
<P>

31	Both parties made their own submissions as to the discretionary factors
which should be considered by the Court when determining
whether to exercise
its discretion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>. Counsel for the plaintiff emphasised
that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.48(1)</a> and (2) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> are remedial in the nature and were intended
to give the Court a wide discretion to extend any time limit, whether
contractual, statutory,
or set in orders by the arbitrator.  
<P>

32	It was submitted for the Plaintiff that the Court, in deciding whether to
exercise its discretion under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48(1)</a>, should primarily take into account
whether any injustice would result, whether prejudice would result to the other
party, and whether
such prejudice could be accounted for by an appropriate
costs order or the imposition of other terms to protect that party's position,
and whether the rigid enforcement of the time limit would provide the other
party with a forensic advantage.
<P>

33	It was submitted on behalf of the Plaintiff that in the light of these
discretionary considerations, and in the context of a
long and complicated
arbitration, the Court should form the view that the Plaintiff should be
entitled to recover costs incurred
up to date, and to deny the Plaintiff of
this entitlement would be to provide the Defendant with a forensic advantage.

<P>

34	It was submitted on behalf of the Defendant that the central question for
the Court to consider when determining whether to exercise
its discretion under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48(1)</a> or the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> was whether it would be fair and just for the Plaintiff to
be granted the extension of time (<i>Salido v Nominal Defendant  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2032%20NSWLR%20524" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 32 NSWLR
524</a></i>).  It was submitted that in considering whether the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48(1)</a> discretion
should be exercised, the Court must consider the reasons for the delay and also
the policy behind the legislation under
which the time limit was imposed. 
<P>

35	As to the question of delay it was submitted, for the Plaintiff, that the
delay by the Plaintiff to apply for costs was of a
minimal nature when one took
into account that the arbitration had already been running for over a year and
a half, and the application
for costs in respect of the interim awards was
foreshadowed on 7 July 1998, and made on 15 July 1998, only 24 days outside the
time.

<P>

36	It was further submitted that the Plaintiff's solicitors first became aware
of Giles J's decision in <i>Holiday Villages</i> on 26 June 1998, which
provided at least a partial explanation for the Plaintiff's delay in making her
costs application.  Until
the effect of this decision was known, the
Plaintiff's legal advisers were of the impression that the Plaintiff's
entitlement to
costs in respect of the interim awards would remain in
existence, even after the expiry of the 14 day period.  Thus they were not
prompted into taking immediate action.
<P>

37	It was contended by the Defendant that the Plaintiff had not provided any
adequate reasons for her delay in applying for a costs
award. It was submitted
that the delays - in excess of 7 months in respect of the first interim award
and almost four weeks in respect
of the second - were substantial, and that
good reasons would have to be provided before a Court should indulge the
Plaintiff and
extend time under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48(1).</a> 
<P>

38	It was submitted for the Defendant that the Plaintiff's solicitors' claim
that they were unaware of the effect of the decision
in <i>Holiday Villages
</i>was  irrelevant.  It was submitted that the relevant knowledge was
knowledge of the 14 day time limit in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a>, not knowledge of the effect of
the <i>Holiday Villages </i>case. 
<P>

39	The Defendant contended that if the Plaintiff had been advised of the time
limit when first advised about the award, on 12 June
1998 according to the
Plaintiff, then the delay demonstrated a total lack of concern for compliance
with the time limit.  
<P>

40	The defendant further contended that if it were the case that the Plaintiff
was not advised of the time limit until after the
14 day period had expired, in
which case an affidavit sworn by her legal advisers would have been
appropriate, there was still an
inexplicable delay between the time when the
Plaintiff gave her instructions to make the costs application, on 29 June 1998,
and
the time when the application was actually foreshadowed, on 7 July 1998,
and then made, on 15 July 1998. 
<P>

41	The Defendant also pointed to the fact that no attempt was made by the
Plaintiff to seek the Defendant's consent to an extension
of time.  
<P>

42	The Plaintiff's legal advisers had asserted that a letter had been written
to the Defendant's solicitors "very soon after" the
second interim award
notifying the Defendant of an intended application for costs.  The Defendant
disputed receiving the letter,
and in any case, if the letter was sent at the
time alleged, it was obviously not in accordance with the Plaintiff's
instructions,
which were not given until 29 June 1998, and was not in
compliance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a>, which requires an application for costs to be made to
the arbitrator. 
<P>

43	Counsel for the Defendant further submitted that the Plaintiff's solicitors
could, and should, have sent a letter to the arbitrator
as soon as they became
aware of time limit imposed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a>, apparently on 26 June 1998. It was
submitted that the Plaintiff's failure to do this and failure to take any
action for another
two weeks demonstrated a blatant disregard for the time
limits imposed by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>.
<P>

44	It was submitted on behalf of the Defendant that the evidence tended to show
that the Plaintiff deliberately disregarded the
time limit imposed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a>,
and therefore the Plaintiff's application for an extension of time under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48(1)</a> could not succeed save in exceptional circumstances (<i>Minenco Pty Ltd
v Abigroup Contractors (WA) Pty Ltd (White J, 24 February 1992,
unreported</i>). 
<P>

45	Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that the Defendant had shown no
prejudice which would be sufficient to persuade the Court
not to exercise its
discretion to extend time under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.48(1)</a> in favour of the Plaintiff. 
<P>

46	The Plaintiff further submitted that the Defendant could not on the one hand
argue that it would be appropriate for the arbitrator
to deal with costs in one
year's time, at the end of the matter, the probable result being a costs award
in favour of the Plaintiff,
yet argue on the other hand that an application for
costs which was a few weeks out of time would be prejudicial to the Defendant.
The result, that is a costs award in favour of the plaintiff, would be the
same.
<P>

47	It was submitted on behalf of the Defendant that, on the Defendant's
interpretation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34(4)</a>, the Plaintiff's claim for an interim costs order
would not be barred forever, and therefore there was no real prejudice to the
Plaintiff.
 It was submitted that the Plaintiff was merely trying to accelerate
her entitlement to recover costs having failed to make an application
in the
time provided.  If the Plaintiff's application were refused, her right to
recover costs would be deferred, not destroyed.
 
<P>

48	The Defendant submitted that there was no cogent evidence to suggest that
prejudice to the Plaintiff could arise on the basis
that the Defendant was in a
precarious financial position and would not be able to pay the Plaintiff's
costs in the future. 
<P>

<u>49	</u>Further, it was submitted by the Defendant that costs are an
inevitable consequence of arbitration proceedings and the Plaintiff should
have
anticipated financial hardship (the Plaintiff claimed that she had spent in
excess of $600,000 on the proceedings to date).
 In any case, it was argued by
the Defendant that an award of costs at this stage would only be of utility to
the Plaintiff if she
could enforce it immediately.  It was submitted that
immediate enforcement of the costs order would be contrary to the usual
practice
whereby costs do not become payable until the conclusion of the
proceedings (<i>SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/index.html#p52a" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 52A</a> r9; Charlie Brown Pty Ltd v Green; Ecroblake Pty Ltd
v Charlie Brown Pty Ltd (McClelland CJ in Eq, 3 July 1995, unreported)</i>).

<P>

<u>50	</u>The Defendant argued that if the Court were to sanction the approach
taken by the Plaintiff, it would be prejudicial to the Defendant
in that the
Court would in effect be requiring the Defendant to provide security for costs.
It was further submitted that a costs
award in favour of the Plaintiff now
would be prejudicial to the Defendant in that it would reduce the funds
available to the Defendant
to defend the Plaintiff's claim on quantum, which
was yet to be decided by the arbitrator.  It was submitted that it would be in
the interests of both parties to finalise the arbitration at the earliest
possible opportunity, without adding to the costs of the
proceedings by
determining quantum of costs on the interim awards.
<P>

51	<i>Holiday Villages</i> is authority for the proposition that an arbitrator
has the power to make a costs award in relation to an interim award and that
nothing in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/index.html#p72" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 72</a> R 12(1) SCR cuts down that power. <i>Holiday Villages</i>
largely turns upon its own facts. 
<P>

52	In <i>Holiday Villages</i> Giles CJ CommD, as he then was, held that an
interim award may be concerned with all claims the subject of an arbitration or
with
some only of those claims. In <i>Holiday Villages</i> the arbitrator had
dealt with a series of claims in tranches dealing with each group of issues
discretely. The arbitrator, in that
case, was unable to deal with questions of
offers of compromise in relation to each interim award, since a global offer of
compromise
could not be disclosed to the arbitrator until the conclusion of the
arbitration as a whole as set out in the passage of <i>Holiday Villages</i>
cites at paragraph 20 above, a respondent may do badly on an interim award and
suffer a costs award but be left with a greater burden
than is warranted, when
a final order is made, such an earlier costs interim award must stand. 
<P>

53	I do not see anything in the decision of <i>Holiday Villages</i> which
precludes the plaintiff seeking an order for costs at the termination of the
proceedings. The decision reaffirms the power
of the arbitrator to make an
interim order for costs of his own volition or at the request of a party. If
the arbitrator is to order
costs then <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/index.html#p72" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 72</a> R12 SCR must be complied with.
<P>

54	I note that in the proceedings before me it is not contended by Mr Scotting
for the defendant that the plaintiff is precluded
from seeking costs at the
termination of the proceedings. That appears to me in any event to be the
proper construction of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s34.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.34</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>. The fact that a party may seek costs at
that interim stage does not deprive the party of a right to seek costs merely
if the earlier
opportunity is not taken. It is noted that in respect of the
second award costs were, in any event, deferred.
<P>

55	The Court is obliged to examine the question of whether there is an
explanation for the delay and must determine that there is
a substantial point
to be argued and that justice is demonstrated if the applicant is arguing the
point. (<i>Doran Construction</i> per Rolfe J in paragraph 29 above) It is
clear, that in the nature of a costs order that a very substantial issue arises
if the plaintiff
is precluded from arguing it. In determining the question of
injustice it is necessary to largely determine the question of whether
there is
any prejudice that arises on either party if the order is made or not made.
<P>

56	In <i>Doran Constructions</i> Rolfe J held that an interim award needs to be
challenged within the same time frame as a final award since it may in fact be
the
final award. There is nothing in the Doran Constructions decision to
deprive a party of the right to seek costs on an interim award,
at the end of
the proceedings. 
<P>

57	There being therefore no prejudice by virtue of the arbitrator's first
interim award where he did deal with and was not asked
to order costs, it is
necessary to examine any other detriment of the plaintiff.
<P>

58	I can see no basis for an interim costs award being made under an <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a> which
is intended to provide a simple mechanism for resolution of disputes other than
the need to take out the order and enforce
the order as to costs. This may
pre-empt a determination on the ultimate costs order depending on whether an
overall offer of compromise
has been made. There is no basis that I can see of
any prejudice in the fact that the interim awards will not have a determination
as to costs until the proceedings are completed.
<P>

59	I accept the submission of the defendant that the plaintiff has not
satisfactorily explained delay for the first award. The delay
of some seven
months is not properly explained and in that respect the plaintiff fails in her
obligation to establish a basis for
the grant of an extension of time. (See
<i>Salido</i>, supra) 
<P>

60	I consider that although there is strictly not a full explanation for the
delay in respect of the second award, the evidence
before me is sufficient to
explain that relatively short delay although it would be preferable, in
legislation which prescribes a
relatively short period for seeking an award for
costs, that a full explanation should be given. In any event the provision made
as to costs by the arbitrator; that the matter be determined at the termination
of the proceedings, does not create any prejudice
on the part of the
plaintiff.
<P>

61	For the reasons enunciated above I do not consider that the plaintiff has
established any injustice or in respect of the first
or second award nor any
satisfactory explanation of delay as a basis for the extension of time for the
first interim award as sought
and the order number 1 sought in the Summons is
therefore declined.
<P>

62	As the plaintiff has sought to make further submissions in the event of a
failure to obtain an order under paragraph 1 of the
Summons I propose to stand
the matter over for further argument of that matter before me, at a time
convenient to the parties, and
I reserve any matters as to costs.
<P>

63	The orders that I make are:
<P>

1. The application for extension of time is refused.
<P>

2. I grant the parties leave to restore the matter for hearing by arrangement
with my Associate to determine any other orders sought.
<P>

3. Costs are reserved.
