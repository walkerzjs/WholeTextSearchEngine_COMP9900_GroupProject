<b>s 62(1)(c) <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ma199281/" class="autolink_findacts">Mining Act 1992</a>)</b>
<P>

1  	<b>MASTER:</b>  By points of claim filed 10 November 1998 the
plaintiff seeks to quash a decision of the chief mining warden made on 18
August 1998.
 The plaintiff relied on the affidavit of Felicity Lisa Gowing
sworn 28 September 1998.  The plaintiff is a coal mining company who
applied
for a mining lease (MLA 96).  The lease extended over land owned by the first
and second defendants.  The first defendants
are John Earl Ducey and Maysie
Sarah Ducey (the Duceys).  The second defendants are Gavin Michael Casey and
Adrianne May Casey (the
Caseys) and the third defendant is John Bailey, the
Chief Mining Warden.  The third defendant has filed a submitting appearance.
<P>

2  	In seeking a judicial review, the plaintiff relied on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ma199281/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 69(3)</a> and
(4) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></b> 1970.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 69(3)</a> declares that the
jurisdiction of court to grant relief or remedy in the nature of a writ of
<i>certiorari</i> includes the jurisdiction to quash the ultimate determination
of a court or tribunal in any proceedings if that determination had
been made
on the basis of an error of law that appears on the face of the records of
proceedings.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 69(4)</a> provides that for the purposes of subsection (3),
the fact of the record includes the reasons expressed by the court or tribunal
for its ultimate determination.  
<P>

3  	The plaintiff seeks judicial review of the findings that the
fences, dam and contour bank are improvements which fall within
the meaning of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s62.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 62(1)</a> on the basis that those findings are tainted by errors of law on the
face of the record.  It is not sought to review the warden's
findings in
relation to the powerlines.
<P>

4  	The defendants seek to uphold the decision of the chief mining
warden.  They contend that there was no justifiable error and
alternatively the
plaintiff does not have standing to bring this action.  It is convenient to
deal with the defendants' second submission
concerning standing here.  It is my
view that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 69(3)</a> and (4) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a></b> 1970 (as amended)
(the Act) gives the court power to quash the decision of the chief mining
warden if it is satisfied that he made
an error of law which appears on the
face of the record of the proceedings as defined in s 69(4) of the Act.
<P>

5  	It is common ground that the mining warden was exercising an
administrative function of inquiring into and reporting on the
nature of the
improvements.
<P>

6  	The facts are not in dispute.  They are as follows:
<P>

(1)	On 7 October 1997 the plaintiff lodged an application for surface mining
lease (MLA 96) over the first and second defendants'
land.  The first and
second defendants are the owners of agricultural land in the Hunter Valley.
<P>

(2)	On 11 November 1997 the first and second defendants objected to the grant
of a lease on the grounds that the land comprised
valuable works and structures
and other improvements pursuant to Schedule 1 cl 23A of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ma199281/" class="autolink_findacts">Mining Act</a></b>
1992 (NSW) (the Act).  The Duceys claimed that their particular improvements
were a dam, a contour bank and fences.  The Caseys claimed
their particular
improvements were fences and power lines.
<P>

(3)	On 15 December 1997 the plaintiff objected to the first and second
defendants' claims.
<P>

(4)	On 21 and 22 July 1998 the chief mining warden, the third defendant, held
an inquiry.
<P>

(5)	On 18 August 1998 the third defendant announced in open court his findings
pursuant to Schedule 1 cl 23B(2) of the <b>Act</b>.  On the same day he sent
the report to the Minister.  He found that the fences, dam and contour bank on
the property of the Duceys
and the fences on the property of the Caseys were
"improvements" within the meaning of s 62 of the Act.  
<P>

7  	I turn to consider the chief mining warden's decision in relation
to s 62 of the <b>Act</b>.  Section 62 of the <b>Act</b> relevantly provides as
follows:
<P>

<b>"(1)	A mining lease may not be granted over any land:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	on which, or within the prescribed distance of which, is situated a
dwelling-house that is the principal place of residence of
the occupier of the
land on which the dwelling-house is situated, or </b>
<P>

<b>(b)	on which, or within the prescribed distance of which, is situated any
garden, or</b>
<P>

<b>(c)	on which is situated any improvement (being a substantial building, dam,
reservoir, contour bank, graded bank, levee, water disposal
area, soil
conservation work or other valuable work or structure) other than an
improvement constructed or used for mining purposes
and for no other
purposes,</b>
<P>

<b>except with the written consent of the occupier (and, in the case of private
land, the owner) of the land on which the dwelling-house,
garden or improvement
is situated.</b>
<P>

<b>	...</b>
<P>

<b>(6)	Any dispute as to whether or not subsection (1) applies in any
particular case is to be referred to a warden for inquiry and report
and is to
be decided by the Minister on the basis of the warden's report.</b>
<P>

<b>	...</b>
<P>

<b>(8)	In this section, valuable work or structure includes anything taken to
be a valuable work or structure for the purposes of this
section by clause 23A
of Schedule 1, but does not include anything declared not to be a valuable work
or structure by clause 23B
of that Schedule."</b>
<P>

8  	Clause 23A(6) of Schedule 1 of the <b>Act</b> provides that where
a claim has been made by an owner or occupier to which objection has not been
taken, the things identified in
the claim are deemed to be a valuable work or
structure for the purposes of s 62(1).  Clause 23B(1) provides that if
objection is
taken to a claim by the applicant for the mining lease, the
Director-General must refer the objection to a mining warden for inquiry
and
report, and anything which is found by the warden not to be a valuable work or
structure is taken not to be a valuable work or
structure for the purposes of s
62(1) clause 23B(3).  Where s 62(1) of the <b>Act</b> applies, a lease may not
be granted unless the owners of the land consent in writing.
<P>

9  	The critical passages in the warden's reasoning are as
follows:
<P>

<b>"In going through various decisions that I researched as to interpretation,
certainly I came to a conclusion that I could not accept,
particularly in
relation to the phrase "or valuable work or structure", that it created a
disjunctive phrase there and that it should
be isolated from those other
specific words which preceded it.  So in relation to the question of whether it
be a substantial dam
of (sic) a substantial contour bank, I reached a
conclusion that the word "substantial" does not apply to other words following
building,
so it did not apply to a dam or a contour bank.  It was my opinion
that if a dam or contour bank is of such standing that they fulfil
the
intention for which they were designed, that they are considered improvements
under provisions of section 62, and I did find
that the dam and contour bank
was of such standing that it fulfilled the intention for which it was
designed.</b>
<P>

<b>As to fencing per se, as to whether it is a valuable work or structure
really depends upon the merits of each individual case.  I
concluded that so
far as the fencing on the Ducey and Casey properties, I accepted that the
presence of the fencing does increase
the value of the land and the fencing
does in fact perform the task for which it was constructed and that is the
control of stock
entering or leaving the land or paddocks which are
incorporated within that fencing."</b>
<P>

10  	In the report to the Minister dated 18 August 1998 (Ex A) the
chief mining warden provided more detailed and clear reasoning
in relation to
his interpretation of s 62(1)(c) of the <b>Act</b>.  The reasons contained in
this report are reasons expressed by the Mining Warden for his ultimate
determination.  
<P>

11  	At pp 8-12 the chief mining warden stated:
<P>

<b>"The mining company submitted that before the subject dam and contour bank
can be considered to be an "improvement", it must be established
that it is a
"substantial dam" and a "substantial contour bank".  Furthermore, that the
phrase "valuable work or structure" must
be construed <i>ejusdem generis</i>
with the words immediately preceding that phrase in section 62.</b>
<P>

<b>The <i>ejusdem generis</i> rules is a rule of law which is utilised to
assist in the interpretation of a Statute.  The rule cited in 1864 in <i>R v
Cleworth</i> (1864) 4B &amp; s 927, where Cockburn CJ said:</b>
<P>

<b>`according to a well established rule in the construction of statutes,
general terms following particular ones apply only to such
persons or things as
are <i>ejusdem generis</i> with those comprehended in the language of the
Legislature'.</b>
<P>

<b>Unless there is a genus or class or category established, there is no room
for any application of the <i>ejusdem generis</i></b> <b>doctrine. (per Lord
Evershed in<i> Ridge v Baldwin </i><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1963/2.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1963] UKHL 2</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20AC%2040" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) AC 40).</a></b>
<P>

<b>By way of an example of the doctrine, in Re <i>Latham</i> (Dec)(1962)Ch616,
Wilberforce J held that the words "or other person" had to be construed
<i>ejusdem generis</i> with "trustee, guardian, committee" and this excluded
persons beneficially interested.  The words had to be limited to persons of
a
fiduciary capacity.  His Lordship considered that if the words (or other
person) were not limited, the specific reference to a
trustee etc. would have
been superfluous.  In addition the specific references were not exhaustive of
the persons who might be regarded
as being in a fiduciary capacity, hence the
reference to other persons was necessary.</b>
<P>

<b>Courts, over the years, have been reluctant to readily use the <i>ejusdem
generis</i> rule because it necessitates a limitation being imposed upon words
that are otherwise of general application.</b>
<P>

<b>Concerning <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ma199281/s62.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 62</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ma199281/" class="autolink_findacts">Mining Act</i> 1992</a>, the words "dam, reservoir,
contour bank, graded bank, levy, water disposal area, soil conservation work,"
all have a genus of having
soil or land constructed in a manner to control or
store water.  If no other words were preceding "or other valuable work or
structure",
it might very well be that those latter words may be construed
<i>ejusdem generis</i> with the previous words.  However, at the commencement
of these specific words referred to earlier, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ma199281/s62.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 62(1)(c)</a> has the term
"substantial building". It is clear that phrase has no reference to a body of
soil which could be used to control or
store water.  Consequently, it appears
that when Parliament passed <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ma199281/s62.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 62(1)(c)</a> it was not restricting
improvements to those matters only involving a soil body utilised to control
water.  In other words there
is no genus in all of those specific words which
precede "or other valuable work or structure".  It is my opinion that the
<i>ejusdem generis</i> rule does not apply in this instance.</b>
<P>

<b>Consequently, fences and power lines may not be excluded as an "improvement"
on the basis of the <i>ejusdem </i>general doctrine.</b>
<P>

<b>The solicitor, for the mining company, Mr J Connors, further submitted that
the word "substantial" which appears before the word "building",
must also
refer to the word "dam" and the words "contour bank".  In other words, an
improvement under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ma199281/s62.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 62(1)(c)</a> must be, inter alia, a "substantial dam" or a
"substantial contour bank".  Furthermore, he submits, the inclusion of the
phrase,
"or other valuable work or structure" also means that a "substantial
dam" must be valuable and a "substantial contour bank" must
be valuable.</b>
<P>

<b>Concerning that submission if Parliament had used the word "and" in lieu of
"or", it would be clear that there was a conjunctive intent
in the subsection.
However, the use of "or" clearly indicates Parliament intended the word "or" to
create a disjunctive phrase. 
Consequently, I cannot accept that "valuable"
refers to those specific words preceding the phrase "or valuable work or
structure".</b>
<P>

<b>As to whether "substantial" is also to apply to "dam", "reservoir", "contour
bank", etc., one must look at the intention of Parliament
in enacting the
particular Act and Section.  In interpreting legislation one must take into
account also the consequences of giving
a particular meaning to an Act.  In
<i>Bistricic v Rakov</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicLawRp/1905/43.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] HCA 54</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%2011%20ALR%20129" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 11 ALR 129</a> at 136, Jacobs J stated:</b>
<P>

<b>`The judicial process of discovering the intention of the legislature where
there is a doubt involves an inference of intention depending
on the language
of the legislation in the light of the circumstances of its enactment, and, if
no particular intention is disclosed
by that process, on the convenience which
would result on the one hand and the complexities which would result on the
other hand
if it were held that the legislation intended the amendment either
to apply or not to apply.</b>
<P>

<b>If the language of an enactment is susceptible to two constructions, regard
must be had to the general object and purpose of the Act,
and, if the Act is
done within the general purview of the statute regard may be had to the
consequences of either construction. 
If one construction will do manifest
injustice and the other avoid it, the latter construction should be
adopted.'</b>
<P>

<b>Punctuation is another matter which may be considered when interpreting a
section;  although the High Court has indicated some caution
should be
exercised if using punctuation for interpretation.  In <i>President etc of
Carlton Shire v Ruse</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1912/33.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1912] HCA 33</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281912%29%2014%20CLR%20220" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1912) 14 CLR 220</a>, Griffith CJ said at p 225:</b>
<P>

<b>`...stops which may be due to a printer's or proof reader's error, ought not
to control the sense if the meaning is otherwise tolerably
clear.'</b>
<P>

<b>Isaacs J at p 229 said:</b>
<P>

<b>`But although I am not prepared to discard wholly the punctation of an Act,
it would be unsafe to allow it to govern the construction.'</b>
<P>

<b>It is of interest to note that Dixon J, in <i>British Medical Assoc v
Commonwealth</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1949/44.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1949] HCA 44</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281949%29%2079%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1949) 79 CLR 201</a>, relied upon punctuation to enable him to
reach his dissenting views.</b>
<P>

<b>The punctuation of the subsection does not support the submission that an
improvement is a "substantial dam" or "substantial contour
bank".  Furthermore,
from the many cases involving a judicial interpretation of the word
"substantial", it is clear that the meaning
of the word is not definite and
"<i>it must be left to the discretion of the judge of fact to decide as best he
can according to the circumstances of each case"</i> the meaning of the word
(as per Viscount Simon in <i>Palser v Grinling</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1948%5d%20AC%20291" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1948] AC 291).</a>  Therefore,
it would appear that the intention of Parliament was not to have "substantial"
attached to each of those words following
"building", for to do so , would mean
in almost every case where one of those "items" is on a property the subject to
a mining lease
application, it would require an Inquiry to determine whether
the "item" was substantial.</b>
<P>

<b>It is my conclusion it was Parliament's intention to utilise the word
"substantial" to apply to a building and to none of the other
"items" listed in
the sub-section.   Further, it was the intention of Parliament to have the
adjective "valuable" applicable to the
words "work" and "structure" and to no
other words in the sub-section.  It follows therefore, that, in the context of
this Inquiry,
the sub-section refers to any dam, or counter bank, or graded
bank, or valuable work or valuable structure.</b>
<P>

<b>According to the Shorter Oxford Dictionary, a "dam" is a "bank or barrier or
earth ... to confine water".  The dam on the Ducey property
does confine water,
it matter not if the water is from the run-off after rain or whether it is
pumped there from another area.</b>
<P>

<b>From the evidence before the Inquiry and from my observations during the
view of the property, I accept that on the Ducey's property
is a dam and a
contour bank, or, if Dr Jones opinion is accepted, a graded bank, and those
items are of such standing that they fulfil
the intention for which they were
designed and as such are considered to be "improvements" under the provisions
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ma199281/s62.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 62</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ma199281/" class="autolink_findacts">Mining Act</i> 1992</a>.</b>
<P>

<b>..."</b>
<P>

12  	The alleged errors are firstly,  that the third defendant erred
in law in holding that the word "substantial" when appearing
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ma199281/s62.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 62(1)(c)</a> of
the <b>Act</b> did not qualify the words following the words "building" in that
paragraph;  secondly, the third defendant erred in law in holding
that it was
sufficient for something to be an improvement within the meaning of s 62(1)(c)
of the <b>Act</b> if it fulfilled the purpose for which it was designed;
thirdly, the third defendant erred in law in holding that the words "valuable
work or structure" should not be construed <i>ejusdem generis</i> with the
immediately preceding words in s 62(1)(c) of the <b>Act</b> and fourthly, the
third defendant erred in law in holding that it was sufficient for something to
be a valuable work or structure
within the meaning of s 62(1)(c) of the
<b>Act</b> if it performed the task for which it was constructed and increased
the value of the land.
<P>

13  	It is common ground that there is no reference to s 62 in the
explanatory memorandum or the second reading speech relating
to the
introduction of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ma199281/" class="autolink_findacts">Mining Act</a></b> 1992.
<P>

14  	I turn to the plaintiff's first submission that contrary to the
construction applied by the warden upon its proper construction
the word
"substantial" in s 62 (1)(c) of the Act applies not only to "building" but also
to the other enumerated improvements listed.
According to the plaintiff, a
matter of ordinary English usage, where an adjective precedes a list of nouns
all of the same class,
the adjective applies to all of the nouns, and not just
the first.  
<P>

15  	The plaintiff submitted that would be a strange construction
that, in order for a building to constitute an improvement within
the meaning
of s 62(1)(c), it must be substantial, while other improvements (which might in
many or most cases be less permanent
and less valuable) are not subject to the
same requirement.  In other words, it would be strange that an insubstantial
building would
not fall within the section, but any graded bank or levee,
substantial or insubstantial, would fall within the section.
<P>

16  	Also according to the plaintiff, although the warden appears to
have had some regard to the punctuation in arriving at the
opposite
construction (report p 11), in truth the punctuation adopted in the statute is
precisely the punctuation which would properly
have been used to produce the
construction contended for by Kayuga.  If the construction adopted by the
warden had been intended
by the legislature, the words "being a substantial
building, or dam, reservoir, contour bank, etc"  would have been used.  It is
my view that the punctuation although it may be used with caution when
interpreting legislation does not assist in the plaintiff's
interpretation of s
62(1)(c).  Punctuation was not a matter which formed the basis of the chief
mining warden's interpretation of
s 62(1)(c).
<P>

17  	Also according to the plaintiff the Act imposes upon applicants
for mining leases the obligation to obtain the written consent
of occupiers or
owners of land if they have a dwelling house or a garden on or close to the
land, or if they have made certain improvements
to the land.  Given that the
presence of an "improvement" within the meaning of s 62(1)(c) gives to the
owner or occupier what amounts
to a veto to any mining lease application, it is
natural to suppose that the intention of the Act is that any improvements
sufficient
to enliven that veto were to be substantial.  The plaintiff
contended this construction is also supported by the words "or other
valuable
work or structure".  Those words suggest that the legislature was contemplating
that the enumerated improvements were themselves
valuable, which is consistent
with their being substantial.
<P>

18  	The defendant submitted that the construction adopted by the
warden (irrespective of the fact that he constitutes a specialist
tribunal) is
without fault.  The suggested construction(s) of the plaintiff give an
altogether different meaning and not one which
is abundantly apparent without
recourse to the matters set out in the plaintiff's submission.  A proper and
literal reading of the
section does not require the contortions suggested.
<P>

19  	According to the defendants section 62(1)(c) of the Act does not
require that the word "substantial" qualify the words after
"building".  That
does not mean that the warden's finding was that the dam, contour bank and the
like were insubstantial.  According
to the defendant it is not to the point to
suggest that his decision was that such structures (because they were not
qualified by
"substantial") did not have to be relevant and important.
According to the defendant, if the Parliament intended each to be substantial
it would have included the relevant word so that the construction propounded by
the plaintiff properly arose.
<P>

20  	The plaintiff referred to <b><u>Ganin v NSW Crime
Commission</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2032%20NSWLR%20423" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 32 NSWLR 423.</a>  In s 25 of the New South Wales
<b>Crime Commission Act</b> 1954 contained the words "any other offence that
involves substantial planning and organisation".  These words were interpreted
to
mean "considerable planning" and "considerable organisation" and according
to the Court of Appeal in the context of s 25, substantial
meant considerable
and not simply the negative of insubstantial (at 443B-C per Kirby P, Meagher JA
and O'Keefe JA agreeing).  Kirby
P (as he then was) also referred to the
statement of Deane J in <b><u>Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Limited v Australasian
Meat Industry Employees Union</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%2042%20FLR%20333" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 42 FLR 333</a> at 348;  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1979/85.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1979] FCA 85</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=27%20ALR%20367" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">27 ALR 367</a> at
382 where Deane J stated the word "substantial" is not only susceptible of
ambiguity, but as "calculated to conceal a lack of
precision".  It is my view
that the word "substantial" was intended to apply only to the word building and
not to the subsequent
items such as a dam, reservoir, contour bank etc.  A
building has different characteristics to that of a dam, reservoir etc.  It
is
of a different genus.  The latter are man made structures that assist the
property owner make use of the natural resources.  I
agree with the chief
mining warden's conclusion that the work "substantial" does not apply to other
words following building.  The
chief mining warden did not make a finding, nor
should he have that the dam , contour bank and fences were insubstantial.
<P>

21  	It is my view that the words "or other valuable work or
structure" are included to give the chief mining warden a wider discretion
to
include other items which are not specifically listed in s 62(1)(c).  I also
agree with the chief mining warden that Parliament
used the word "or" to create
a disjunctive phrase so the word "valuable" does not refer to the preceding
phrase.
<P>

22  	In relation to the plaintiff's second submission that fences are
not improvements for the purposes of s62 (1)(1) it submitted
that on its true
construction, the fences which were said by the Duceys and Caseys, and held by
the warden, to be improvements within
the meaning of s 62(1)(c) do not fall
within the paragraph.  The plaintiff accepted that in its ordinary meaning, a
fence is an "improvement"
upon land.  However it is submitted, in the context
of s 61(1), the meaning of the word "improvement" is confined by the scope of
the parenthesised words which follow.  Only such improvements as are properly
described by the parenthesised words are improvements
for the purposes of s
2(1).  According to the plaintiff the parenthesised words must constitute an
exhaustive, rather than an inclusive
definition, for any other construction
would do violence to the word "being".  According to the plaintiff, it follows
that the only
way in which s 62(1)(c) can apply to fences is if a fence is
comprehended within the words "other valuable work or structure".  
<P>

23  	According to the plaintiff on their true construction the words
"other valuable work or structure" must be considered <i>ejusdem generis</i> as
the preceding words.  The enumerated list of words identifies two classes of
things (a) buildings, and (b) soil works designed
to conserve water.  If the
warden was correct in concluding that "substantial" governs only the words
"building" and not the later
integers, then that points to the words
"substantial building" being excluded from the relevant class.  As the warden
held, the following
words "all have a genus of having soil or land constructed
in a manner to control or store water" ( report p 9).  Thus, if the warden
is
correct as to "substantial" applying only to the word "building", the following
words properly constitute a genus to which the
words "or other valuable work or
structure" must be read <i>ejusden generis</i>.  According to the plaintiff
were the above construction not upheld, it would follow that the owner or
occupier of any land on which
there is a fence would have the right to veto a
mining application.  
<P>

24  	The defendant submitted that the warden found (on the evidence
and inspection) that the fences, dam and contour bank were important
structures
(in their context).  He did this upon specific enquiry and found that they were
valuable in the sense of the historical
use of the land.  
<P>

25  	The meaning of s62(1)(c) is that a mining lease may not be
granted over any land where there is principal place of residence
of the
occupier or a garden or according to subsection (c) where there is situated any
improvement.  Some of the improvements are
defined as being a substantial
building, dam or other valuable work or structure.  The meaning of those words
are clear and unambiguous.
 There is a discretion given in s 62(1)(c) to decide
if there are other items on the land which are defined as something other than
a dam or levee or graded bank but that other item must be a "valuable work or
structure".  As the chief mining warden stated the
words "substantial building"
have no reference to a body of soil which could be needed to control or store
water and there is no
genus in all of the specific words which precede "or
other valuable work or structure".  It is also my view that the <i>ejusdem
generis</i> rule should not be applied.  The chief mining warden had a
discretion to decide whether the fences constituted a valuable structure.
 He
found that the presence of the fencing on the Ducey and Casey properties
increased the value of the land and the control of stock
entering or leaving
land or paddocks which are incorporated within that fencing.  For reasons given
earlier the fencing does not
have to be substantial  The chief mining warden
was entitled to come to that conclusion and it should not be disturbed.
Likewise
the chief mining warden also decided that the dam was on the Duceys'
property did confine water and there was a contour bank and
those items were of
such standing that they fulfilled the intention for which they were designed
and were considered "improvements"
under s 62(1)(c) of the Act.  There is no
error of law in the approach of the chief mining warden.
<P>

26  	It is my view that the plaintiff has not demonstrated that the
chief mining warden made an error of law and accordingly his
decision should
not be disturbed.  The points of claim should be dismissed with costs. 
<P>

27  	The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	The points of claim filed 11 November 1998 is dismissed.
<P>

(2)	The plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs.
