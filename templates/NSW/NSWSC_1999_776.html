<b>5152/97 - FEDOROVITCH &amp; ANOR V ST AUBINS PTY LTD &amp; ORS  (NO
2)</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>On 14 May this year I gave reasons for
judgment in an oppression suit which arose out of a relatively small series of
incidents and
then mushroomed.  I came to the view that there had been
oppression and that relief should be given.  I then stood the matter over
for
valuations of the relevant property to be obtained.  The company concerned is a
home unit company and its only business is to
hold a block of four units at
Waverton and to permit the shareholders to occupy one each.
<P>

2   	Normally the court gives the minimum relief that is
appropriate to neutralise the oppression.  In this case that relief would
have
been along the lines of forbidding the second defendant, Mr King, to be
chairman, and perhaps to permit the plaintiffs or Mrs
Henrietta Lopacinski to
be the chairman with a casting vote. However, neither side wished me to take
that course.
<P>

3   	Accordingly, it comes down to a question of ordering the
plaintiffs to sell their shares, as would be acceptable to the first
and second
defendants, or ordering the second defendant's shares to be sold to the third
defendant, Dr Christine Lopacinski, as the
third defendant suggests would be
appropriate.
<P>

4   	Mr Enright, who appeared for the third defendant, points to
the fact that s 246AA of the Corporations Law is a very wide section
and gives
the court ample scope for moulding the remedy in the appropriate way.  That is
certainly true and that approach has commended
itself to some of the cases, for
instance in<b> Re Bodaibo Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%206%20ACSR%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 6 ACSR 509</a> Vincent J remarked that
the provisions of the predecessor of s 246AA have been drafted in the widest
form in order to accommodate
the almost limitless variety of circumstances that
might arise.
<P>

5   	However, the court must bear a few things in mind when
making an order under this section.  The first is that the section is
fairly
common in the Common Law world and the approach to the section has been
relatively uniform.  It is important in the public
interest that that uniform
approach continue to be followed, so that shareholders and their legal advisers
and accountants will be
able to advise them.
<P>

6   	Secondly, there is no express provision in s 246AA for
compensation to be payable in respect of an oppressive act. It is possible
that
one can imply that into the general words "make such order or orders as it
thinks fit" in s 246AA(2), but it is significant
that no court, as far as I am
aware, has ever made such an order.  This fits in, I think, with the general
policy of the Law, which
I will come to shortly.
<P>

7   	The third matter is that the courts, particularly the
courts in England, have consistently maintained the approach that if
a
reasonable offer is made by the defendant then ordinarily at that stage the
defendant will be entitled to have the petition struck
out.  The most recent
and authoritative in this line is<b> O'Neill v Phillips</b> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] UKHL 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1999%5d%201%20WLR%201092" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] 1 WLR 1092</a>,
1107.
<P>

8   	The section which is now s 246AA first appeared in the 1948
English Companies Act as s 210.  Its purpose was to protect the
minority, who,
without such protection, were in a situation where their capital had been
invested in a project which was being employed
oppressively against them, yet
they could not recover their capital because it was locked into the venture.
The aim, accordingly,
was either to stop the oppression within the company or
else to wind the company up so that the venture's capital could be released.
<P>

9   	Since its original appearance in the Act, the section has
been reframed to allow other remedies, so that today the prime remedy
is a
buy-out by one side of the other.  Essentially, however, the aim still is to
permit the minority to free its capital, even though
it has locked its capital
into a venture.   The reason for this is that it is unfair that the capital
should continue to be locked
up if the circumstances are indicative of
oppression.  Accordingly, the prime thrust of the section is to either make the
venture
work so that the capital is properly employed, or to allow the capital
to be removed.  It is not for punishment or compensation or
for making the
profit that ought to have been made had the venture been successful.
<P>

10   	Although no-one has ever voiced it, it seems to me that
this essentially is the reason for the adoption of the rule that ordinarily
the
proper order is that the oppressor buy out the oppressed.  This is in line with
the policy that if a reasonable offer is made
to buy out the oppressed the
petition will be struck out because all that the minority can really insist on
is either the venture
should proceed in accordance with what was understood or
that he or she should get back the capital invested.
<P>

11   	A general rule was formulated most succinctly by Judge
Weeks QC in<b> Wilton-Davies v Kirk</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1998%5d%201%20BCLC%20274" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1998] 1 BCLC 274</a>, 277.  In that case
both sides had equal shareholdings and his Honour said:
<P>

"If there had been great disparity of holding I would have formed a prima facie
view that the majority should, as usually occurs,
buy out the minority ...
".
<P>

12   	I considered that decision and the other English decisions
at some length in<b> Fexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/413.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 413</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2028%20ACSR%20688" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 28
ACSR 688</a>, 743, where I said, quoting <b>Wilton-Davies'</b> case and omitting
reference to authority:
<P>

"The ordinary order is that the majority buy out the minority ... .  There have
been orders made that the majority sell their shares
to the minority, but this
has been considered to be exceptional ... "
<P>

13   	I then said:
<P>

"Ordinarily, the court will not order an oppressed plaintiff to sell his shares
against his will.  It may [be that the court will]
allow the plaintiff to elect
to continue to live under the defendant's regime or sell his shares to the
majority at valuation."
<P>

14   	In the present case, as I have indicated, the proposal  by
the first and second defendants is that they should buy the plaintiffs'
shares.
The proposal by the plaintiffs and the third defendant is that the third
defendant should buy the second defendant's shares
at valuation.
<P>

15   	The second defendant does not want to sell his shares. He
says his unit has been his home for the last seventeen years and
he does not
want to sell.
<P>

16   	The first plaintiff says that he would prefer not to sell.
He says that it is an investment unit which he has purchased to
enjoy quite a
good income and in due course was hoping to pass the property to his grandson
by his will, though, of course, that
purpose may change as time goes on.  He is
prepared to sell, but is certainly an unwilling vendor, and he is also
concerned about
the capital gains tax that will be payable on a sale.
<P>

17   	As to capital gains tax, I have been given some figures
and I can estimate others in such a way as to be close to the mark
without
having to send the case back for further evidence.
<P>

18   	If the value of the plaintiffs' shares is $340,000, the
capital gains tax payable by the plaintiffs will be approximately
$41,000.  If
the value is $300,000, it will be $20,000, with approximately $5,000 extra tax
for every $10,000 value above $300,000.
 The plaintiffs say that they should
not have to pay that capital gains tax and an order should be made adjusting
the value of the
shares so that in effect the oppressor pays for a sale which
he has forced by his conduct.
<P>

19   	The first decision to be made is who should buy and who
should sell.
<P>

20   	I have set out what is, on the authorities, the general
principle that is to be followed.  Mr Enright has submitted that the
court is
not bound to do that and that submission is, of course, correct but, as I have
said, it is appropriate to follow the general
course of authority unless there
is some special reason not to.
<P>

21   	Mr Enright says that this is a special case.  He says
there is no case in the reports that any of us have been able to find
where a
home unit company has been the subject of an oppression suit.  It is a
particular class of company in which the owners or
occupiers need to work
fairly closely together.  None of the parties really want to sell, though on
the other hand none of them are
sufficiently interested in coming to some
management compromise which would allow them to retain their property and to
live together.
<P>

22   	There are instances in the authorities where the majority
has been ordered to sell its shareholding.  The only reported authorities
are
the decision of Harman J in<b> Re A Company;  Ex Parte Shooter</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1990%5d%20BCLC%20384" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1990] BCLC
384</a> and the decision of Rattee J in<b> Re Brenfield Squash Racquets Club
Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%202%20BCLC%20184" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 2 BCLC 184.</a>
<P>

23   	In the first of those cases the company ran a football
club.  The shares were of nominal value.  The real power in holding
the shares
was the voting power and control.  The oppression was the repeated failure to
hold annual meetings and to lay proper accounts
before the members, and the
order that was made at p 395 was to order the controlling shareholder to cease
to be the controlling
shareholder in the club.  That  was a very exceptional
case and little can be done, even by analogy, to relate it to the present
case.
<P>

24   	I find the decision in <b>Brenfield</b> a little hard to
understand, but it would seem that one of the factors which triggered the
decision was the fact that the pre-emption
provision in the shareholders'
agreement had already been triggered.  In spite of the submissions of Mr
Enright and, indeed, the
submissions of Mr Wilson for the plaintiffs, I do not
think that the present situation is so exceptional that I should depart from
the general approach.  This approach is consistent with the whole policy of s
246AA that what the oppressed is entitled to is to
be released from the company
if he finds that because of the opponent's oppression he or she can no longer
have their capital invested
in it.
<P>

25   	Accordingly, the proper order is that at his option, to be
exercised within, say, twenty-eight days, the second defendant
or his nominee
must purchase the plaintiffs' shares in the capital of the first defendant at a
value to be fixed by the court.
<P>

26   	The next question is what is the value of the shares.
<P>

27   	The court has received the evidence of two land valuers,
Mr Carroll, on behalf of the first and second defendants, and Mr
O'Neill, on
behalf of the plaintiffs.  Neither valued the shares.  Both made the assumption
that the value of the property which
the company owned was the sum total of the
value of the four flats.  A moment's thought can see that this is not
necessarily a correct
assumption, because we just do not know whether the site
is being used to its maximum advantage.  It may be, for instance, as apparently
is the case with other units in the same street that multi-storey blocks are
permitted which have some harbour views and if there
is a harbour view the
value of the unit increases.  Both valuers have merely approached the problem
by valuing each of the existing
units in the existing building.  However, that
being the approach I really have to act on that sort of evidence,
unsatisfactory though
it is.
<P>

28   	Mr O'Neill puts the value of unit 4, which the plaintiffs
own, as about $340,000.  Mr Carroll puts it nearer $300,000.  Both
have common
comparable sales, though Mr Carroll has a greater list of comparable sales than
Mr O'Neill.
<P>

29   	Looking at the comparable sales, first I think I should on
Mr Carroll's evidence, which I accept, make a discount as against
the sale of a
strata title unit for the fact that this unit is held under company title.
Again I take into consideration the difference
between a unit with a harbour
view and one with a harbour glimpse.  On this basis, it would seem to me that
the value of unit 4 is
nearer $300,000 than $340,000.  The comparable sales
really seem to me to work out at somewhere between $305,000 and $310,000 when
one makes the adjustments.  Accordingly, I will find that the fair value is
$310,000.
<P>

30   	The next issue is whether having found that price I should
add on another $25,000 for capital gains tax and also a further
amount because
Mr and Mrs Fedorovitch have to pay the legal costs of selling the existing unit
and the legal costs and stamp duty
of buying a replacement unit.  At the moment
I will adopt $20,000 as that cost.
<P>

31   	So far as capital gains tax is concerned, there is no
direct authority.  In compensation cases the general attitude  appears
to be
that the tax is not part of the compensation; see for instance<b> Joondalup
Gates Pty Ltd v Minister for Lands </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2033%20ATR%20327" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 33 ATR 327</a>, a decision of Parker
J of the Western Australia Supreme Court with assessors sitting as the Western
Australia Compensation Court,
and see also<b> Russellan Pty Ltd v Roads and
Traffic Authority</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2075%20LGRA%20263" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 75 LGRA 263.</a>
<P>

32   	However, I believe the case that comes closest to the
present is the decision of Rolfe J in<b> Provan v HCL Real Estate Ltd</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2024%20ATR%20238" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 24 ATR 238.</a>  In that case the plaintiff was awarded damages for breach
of fiduciary duty, he would have to pay capital gains tax on that award
and
Rolfe J held that it was proper that the defendant pay the tax as part of the
damages.
<P>

33   	Mr Davidson for the first and second defendants, submits
that<b> Provan's</b> <b>case</b> is distinguishable because that was a case of
damages, whereas the present does not involve any compensatory factor, it is
merely
a case of valuing shares.
<P>

34   	Mr Davidson puts that either as a matter of jurisdiction
or alternatively a matter of discretion, the court can only value
the shares by
taking the market value plus adjustments for the fact that the majority's
conduct has lessened the value that they
otherwise would have (see eg<b>
Kizquari Pty Ltd v Prestoo Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2010%20ACSR%20606" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 10 ACSR 606)</a>, or alternatively
where the oppressed has been forced to sell at the bottom of the market (see<b>
Re Bodaibo Pty Ltd</b> (supra)).
<P>

35   	I am not at all convinced that there is no jurisdiction to
value the shares otherwise.  The order set out in s 246AA(2)(e)
leaves it
completely open as to what the purchase price should be.  However, I do not
believe that the proper approach to the section
is to include in it any element
of compensation.  Although one can adjust the price for the conduct of the
oppressor, or perhaps
in the way Vincent J approached the matter in<b>
Bodaibo</b>, one cannot or should not give compensation under the guise of an
enhanced purchase price.
<P>

36   	Accordingly, I do not consider that I can add to the value
of the shares a factor for capital gains tax.
<P>

37   	If I had been able to do that, the question would be
whether I should have allowed the whole of the capital gains tax or only
a
proportion.   Whenever the Fedorovitchs sell this unit they will have to pay
capital gains tax.  The unit was bought as an investment
unit.  Although there
is no current intention to sell, it may well be that circumstances will force a
sale in the next ten years,
and there may have to be tax payable when the
property is realised in the estate.   Accordingly, all that is really happening
by
the capital gains tax being paid now is that it is being paid ahead of time.
Had I allowed capital gains tax I would have reduced
the amount by two-thirds
to compensate for those factors, and so on the figures that I have worked out
would have allowed something
like $9,000.
<P>

38   	I think the other head is also a matter for compensation
and not for adding on to the value of the shares.  Mr Wilson submits
that in
cases like<b> Kontos v Roads and Traffic Authority</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2075%20LGRA%20218" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 75 LGRA 218</a> the
expenses of acquiring a substitute property were allowed, but that is
distinguishable on the basis that that is a compensation
case rather than the
present, which is not a compensation case.
<P>

39   	Accordingly, the fair value of the shares is $310,000.
<P>

40   	That only leaves the question of costs.  In my reasons of
14 May I said that my inclination was that indemnity costs should
be payable
because the whole of the problem had come about through Mr King's reaction to a
series of minor incidents.  I have now
heard Mr Davidson of counsel.  He
submits that not all the main points originally made by the plaintiffs were
pressed at the trial.
 He also puts that the late involvement of Dr Lopacinski
as a party last Monday has wasted costs.
<P>

41   	Dealing with that last matter first, I really think that
one of the Lopacinskis should have been a party from the beginning,
but I do
think that the costs this week have not really been the fault of the first and
second defendants and that after 14 May everyone
should bear their own costs,
especially in view of the way in which the plaintiffs and the third defendant
have failed in their main
submissions.
<P>

42   	However, despite what Mr Davidson said, I still believe
that the proper order for costs up to 14 May is that the second defendant
should pay the plaintiffs' costs on the indemnity basis.  The exhibits may be
returned.
<P>

[There was a short adjournment whilst counsel considered the form of order in
the light of these reasons]
<P>

43   	 I make the following orders and declarations: 
<P>

1.   Make a declaration in terms of paras 1 and 2 of the summons filed 17
December 1997. 
<P>

2.   Make a declaration that in the circumstances which have occurred, the
first defendant has conducted its affairs in a manner
that is oppressive to the
plaintiffs within the meaning of s 246AA of the Corporations Law.  
<P>

3.   Note that the plaintiffs are to place their shareholding in the capital of
the first defendant for sale by public auction with
a reserve of $310,000, or
alternatively sell by private treaty at not less than that figure, with
contracts to be exchanged no later
than 21 October 1999.
<P>

4.  Order that in the event that the plaintiffs have not so sold their property
by 21 October 1999 I order the second defendant
to purchase the said shares for
the sum of $310,000, completion to take place no later than 21 November
1999.
<P>

5.   Reserve further consideration generally and in particular should there be
any problems about the purchaser from the plaintiffs
having difficulties in
becoming registered as the owner of the shares.
<P>

6.  Order the second defendant to pay the plaintiffs' costs of the proceedings
on the indemnity basis up to and including 14 May
1999.  I make no order for
costs after 14 May 1999 until today.  Further costs are reserved.
<P>

7.   Order that the exhibits be returned.
