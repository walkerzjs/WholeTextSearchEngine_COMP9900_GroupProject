<b><u>70088/97 - REGINA v Susan Maria HALL</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>70214/97 - REGINA v Colin George HANSLOW</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>SENTENCE</u></b>
<P>

1   	<b>HER HONOUR:   </b>On 29 March 1999 Susan Maria Hall and
Colin George Hanslow appeared before me together with a co-accused, Colin David
Simpson.  On
that occasion, Susan Maria Hall pleaded guilty to one count on
indictment charging her with the manslaughter of Gary Henderson on
a date
between 19 August and 26 August 1996.  Colin David Simpson pleaded guilty to
maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon
Gary Henderson on or about 19
August 1996.  Colin George Hanslow was not represented on that occasion and I
stood his matter over,
without taking a plea, to enable him to obtain a grant
of legal aid.  
<P>

2   	The proceedings against Hall and Simpson were stood over
for submissions on sentence.  On 4 June 1999 I sentenced Colin David
Simpson to
a term of twelve months penal servitude comprising a minimum term of eight
months and an additional term of four months.
 It should be noted that this
sentence was expressed to take into account the circumstance that Mr Simpson
had already served, prior
to his release on bail, a period of two years and
twenty-six days custody solely referable to the commission of the subject
offence.
 
<P>

3   	On 27 May 1999 when the matters of Hall and Simpson were
listed before me for submissions on sentence Colin George Hanslow
was arraigned
on an indictment which charged him with the manslaughter of Gary Henderson and
with being an accessory after the fact
to the infliction of grievous bodily
harm upon Gary Henderson by Colin Simpson. He pleaded not guilty to the
manslaughter count and
guilty to the accessory count. Both matters were stood
over to 16 July. It was anticipated that the Director of Public Prosecutions
would give consideration in the interim as to whether it was proposed to
proceed on the manslaughter count.  In the event, I was
informed on 16 July,
that the Crown did not propose to proceed with respect to that matter.  
<P>

4   	The body of the deceased, Gary Henderson, was found on the
afternoon of 28 August 1996 lying on a mud bank adjacent to the
water's edge
near the Silverwater boat ramp at Lansvale.  The deceased was a single man aged
about 35 years.  He suffered from cerebral
palsy.  Both his left arm and left
leg were wasted.  Additionally it appears that he was intellectually disabled.
He was a slightly
built individual.  Dr Ellis, pathologist, examined the body
at the site and subsequently conducted a post mortem.  The doctor concluded
that death was caused as the result of head, chest and abdominal injury,
compression of the neck, probable immersion/drowning.
<P>

5   	The police investigations revealed that the deceased had
been living in a caravan at the Lansvale Caravan Park with Susan Hall
and her
de facto partner, Colin Hanslow.  Colin Simpson was on friendly terms with both
Hall and Hanslow and on occasions he visited
them at the caravan park.  All
three suffered to some degree from intellectual handicap.  
<P>

6   	The caravan appears to have been rented by Susan Hall and
Colin Hanslow.  The deceased came to stay with them some weeks prior
to his
death.  He had given Ms Hall his bank "Handycard".  It appears that the
proceeds of his pension were withdrawn from his account
by Ms Hall who used the
funds for the purchase of food and other necessities.  In this sense Ms Hall
assumed some responsibility
for the care of the deceased.  
<P>

7   	On or about 19 August 1996 the prisoner, Colin Simpson,
inflicted a severe beating on the deceased.  This occurred in the caravan.
From that time on the evidence suggests that the deceased did not leave the
caravan prior to the evening of 26 August when he was
transported from there to
the vicinity of the boat ramp.  At that time the likelihood is that he was
dead.  The latter conclusion
cannot be assumed with confidence since Dr Ellis
was not able to exclude drowning as a cause of death.  
<P>

8   	In the period preceding the assault upon the deceased it
would seem there had been some tensions in the caravan.  The deceased
had
difficulty in attending to matters of personal hygiene and this became a source
of some frustration to Ms Hall and Mr Hanslow.
 It also appears that the
deceased was believed to have given out Ms Hall and Mr Hanslow's silent
telephone number to some unnamed
person or persons.  Finally there was a
suggestion that the deceased was a child molester (there is no evidence to
suggest this was
the case).  A combination of these matters appears to have led
Colin Simpson to embark on his assault on the deceased.  
<P>

9   	There is little evidence as to what happened in the period
of about a week following that assault prior to the deceased's death.
 
<P>

10   	On the evening of 26 August Susan Hall and Colin Hanslow
were observed carrying the body of the deceased from the caravan
and placing it
in the rear of their panel van.  From there the body was transported to the
vicinity of the Silverwater boat ramp.

<P>

11   	The basis upon which the Crown put its case against Susan
Hall, and upon which the plea was entered, was that of manslaughter
by
omission.  It is common ground that in the period following the assault upon
the deceased by Colin Simpson, Susan Hall ought to
have obtained medical
assistance for him and that she failed so to do.  The Crown case against Colin
Hanslow depends wholly upon
his actions in assisting in the removal of the
deceased from the caravan and placing his body near the Silverwater boat
ramp.
<P>

12   	I will deal firstly with the prisoner Susan Hall.  On 27
May 1999 when I heard submissions on sentence with respect to both
Ms Hall and
Colin Simpson, a set of agreed facts was tendered and became Exhibit Q in the
proceedings.  On that occasion a submission
was advanced on the prisoner's
behalf that her culpability with respect to the failure to obtain medical
assistance needed to be
evaluated in the light of her intellectual handicap.  I
subsequently sought further submissions from both the Crown and on behalf
of
the prisoner  as to the basis upon which the plea had been entered.  The agreed
facts, while setting out quite a deal of background
material, did not, in
terms, identify the facts relied upon as establishing either the legal duty to
which it was said Susan Hall
was subject nor the particulars of breach of that
duty in terms of the failure to provide assistance.  
<P>

13   	It is plain that at common law a person does not incur
criminal liability in respect of his or her failure to take action
to prevent
the occurrence of harm to another:  <b>R v Taktak</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2034%20A%20Crim%20R%20334" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 34 A Crim R 334.</a>
Before a person may be convicted of manslaughter by omission it is necessary to
identify a legally recognised duty to act to which
the accused was subject.
One recognised duty is that of a person who voluntarily assumes the care of
another who, by reason of age
or incapacity, is unable to care for him or
herself.  The failure to provide medical assistance and/or food to that person
may expose
the carer to liability for manslaughter.  This is the basis upon
which the case against Ms Hall is put.  The Crown points to Ms Hall's
acknowledgment, in a statement that she made to police, that she was aware that
Gary Henderson suffered from cerebral palsy.  Reliance
is also placed on the
financial arrangements between the deceased and the prisoner involving her
assuming the custody of his Handycard
and purchasing food and other necessities
on his behalf.  The Crown points to admissions by Hall as to her knowledge of
the infliction
of injuries upon the deceased by Simpson during the course of
the assault on 19 August.  There is evidence from Dr Ellis that the
deceased
had bed sores. The Crown does not suggest, having regard to Ms Hall's
intellectual limitations, that the appearance of bed
sores should have alerted
her to the need to turn the deceased in the bed. Rather, the Crown points to
the evidence as to the bed
sores as showing that in the week following the
assault by Colin Simpson the deceased was immobile in bed.  Such a view
receives
support from the evidence of the witness, Vanessa Jett, who called to
the caravan on an occasion after the assault.  She observed
that Gary Henderson
was lying inert on his bunk.  She spoke with him and observed that he was
bruised.  
<P>

14   	Mr Rumore who appeared on behalf of Ms Hall on the last
occasion conceded that it was open to me to find that, in the days
following
the assault by Colin Simpson, the deceased was immobile.  He accepted, as must
flow from the plea, that despite her intellectual
deficit Ms Hall had the
capacity and did know that Gary Henderson's injuries were such that he required
medical attention.  It is
upon this basis that I approach the matter of
sentence in the case of the prisoner Susan Hall.
<P>

15   	I have the benefit of a helpful and detailed report by
G.D. Fathers, psychologist, who assessed Ms Hall shortly before these
proceedings.  That report describes her background.  The prisoner is an
unemployed 37 year old woman in receipt of a disability support
pension.  She
has been a recipient of such a pension since about 1978.  Both Ms Hall's
parents are deceased.  She gave Mr Fathers
an account of growing up in a home
characterised by frequent violent episodes by her father.  She was aged about 6
or 7 when he died.
 Her mother died in 1978 when she was about 17.  
<P>

16   	It appears that prior to her mother's death Ms Hall had
been made a State Ward.  She had had frequent contact with the Department
of
Youth and Community Services up until the age of about 21 years.  More
recently, she appears to have had contact with officers
of the Department of
Community Services on occasions, although the reasons for that were not clear.

<P>

17   	The prisoner's schooling was limited. She attended "Mater
Dei" in  Camden which catered for the intellectually handicapped
and learning
disabled.  Most of the focus of activities at "Mater Dei" appears to have been
of a diversionary nature with an emphasis
on practical skills such as craft
work, social interaction and the development of personal routine.  After
leaving "Mater Dei" she
lived for a time at a place called "Brushfarm" at
Eastwood.  Mr Fathers describes this as an institution for people with
intellectual
impairment and pervasive developmental disorders.  The prisoner
appears to have left Brushfarm when aged about 17.  From there she
went to live
in a hostel in Wollongong where she remained for several years.  That hostel
also served as a sheltered workshop and
training centre.  
<P>

18   	When she was aged about 20, the prisoner moved to Sydney.
Some time following that move she met her de facto husband, Colin
Hanslow.  She
appears to have been in a relationship with Mr Hanslow for most of her adult
life.  She has no work history apart from
the time spent in work preparation
centres or sheltered workshops.  Mr Fathers summarises the position in this
way:
<P>

"Ms Hall presents as intellectually impaired and therefore not fully able to
think and reason.  She has a history of living in personally
and socially
impoverished circumstances, supported by pension assistance.  While functional
in a personal and social sense, Ms Hall
can only manage a limited routine and
does need assistance and re-assurance in this.  She has no work history and no
work task skill
set.  Her education was very limited and interrupted by her
intellectual impairment and other learning disability, her need for
institutional
care due to family dysfunction and neglect and Ms Hall's
sometimes difficult behaviour."
<P>

19   	I have also been supplied with a psychiatric report
prepared by Dr Lucire.  Dr Lucire notes that Ms Hall "is a mentally retarded
person and has been so from birth".  She goes on to observe:
<P>

"The intelligence tests show a high degree of scatter so there is a lack of
evenness in her functioning.  Some of the more subtle
mental capabilities might
be entirely absent."
<P>

Dr Lucire also expressed the following opinion:
<P>

"It is apparent to me that she knows what has happened is wrong.  She now knows
that she should have done something to stop it.
 However it is not possible to
know exactly what went through her mind at the time except from her
actions."
<P>

20   	I note this observation since it might be thought to not
sit well with the prisoner's plea.  As I have already noted, I stood
this
matter over to enable the basis of the plea to be clarified and I am satisfied
that notwithstanding her limitations the prisoner
had assumed responsibility
for the care of the deceased and that she failed to obtain assistance when she
knew she ought to have
done so.  In this regard I take into account the
contents of the prisoner's ERISP.  
<P>

21   	On behalf of the prisoner it has been submitted that I
might impose a non-custodial sentence. It is put that this unusual
course is
open having regard to the circumstance that this is a case of manslaughter by
omission where the prisoner's culpability
is mitigated by intellectual
impairment. I should note that the Crown submitted that in the circumstances of
this case a non-custodial
sentence was within the range of the proper exercise
of my sentencing discretion.
<P>

22   	I am mindful of the observations of the Court of Criminal
Appeal in <b>R v MacDonald</b> (unreported, NSWCCA, 12 December 1995).  In that
case the court emphasised the denunciatory role of sentencing in the context of
manslaughter.  After noting that manslaughter involves the felonious taking of
human life the court observed:
<P>

"This may involve a wide variety of circumstances, calling for a wide variety
of penal consequences.  Even so, unlawful homicide,
whatever form it takes, has
always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime.  The protection of
human life and personal
safety is a primary objective of the system of criminal
justice.  The value which the community places upon human life is reflected
in
its expectations of that system."
<P>

23   	This is a case where I consider that the prisoner's
intellectual limitations do operate to significantly mitigate her culpability.
This leads me to give less weight to considerations of general deterrence than
might otherwise be appropriate:  <b>R v Scognamiglio</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2056%20A%20Crim%20R%2081" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 56 A Crim R 81</a>;
<b>R v Anderson</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1981/17.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] VicRp 17</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%20VR%20155" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1981] VR 155</a>;  <b>R v Letteri</b> (unreported, NSWCCA, 18
March 1992);  and <b>R v Wright</b> (unreported, NSWCCA, 28 February 1997).
<P>

24   	I accept that the prisoner pleaded guilty at the first
opportunity.  This is taken to reflect a degree of contrition.  There
is
nothing to suggest contrition going beyond this but I accept that flows from
her intellectual limitations.  
<P>

25   	The prisoner's criminal record is not an extensive one. It
appears that in October of 1981 she was convicted before the Central
Court of
Petty Sessions of offences of forge, utter and stealing and placed on a
recognisance.  The only other matter is an entry
in February of 1989 when she
was convicted before the Katoomba Local Court on a charge of malicious damage
and again placed on a
recognisance.  I do not consider the criminal record
stands in the way of extending some leniency to this prisoner.  
<P>

26   	Following her arrest, Ms Hall was in custody for a period
of about two months prior to her release on bail.  She has been
at liberty on
bail for a period of almost three years.  During that time she has reported
daily to police.  At times she has been
subject to residential requirements as
a condition of bail.  Most recently she was subject to a condition that she
reside at "Samaritan
House" an institution operated by the Salvation Army.
Captain McGrath gave evidence on 26 May that Ms Hall had been compliant with
the house curfew and other of the rules of that establishment.  Subsequently,
there was an unfortunate development which was not
the fault of the prisoner.
On 3rd June, Captain McGrath attended court together with the prisoner and
other residents of "Samaritan
House".  On that occasion, Colin Simpson was
sentenced.  For the first time Captain McGrath and the other residents of the
house
became aware of the unpleasant nature of the assault committed by Simpson
on the deceased.  It appears that after this the residents
complained to
Captain McGrath that they did not wish to be further associated with the
prisoner.  In those circumstances, Captain
McGrath asked Ms Hall to leave.
Major Harmer, the Salvation Army Court Chaplain, contacted Ms Hall's solicitor
who in turn drew the
matter to the attention of the court.  Major Harmer used
his best endeavours to find alternative accommodation for the prisoner.
 The
only accommodation that he was able to arrange was at the Sydney Central Hotel.
The prisoner's bail was varied to permit her
to reside at that establishment.
When the matter was before me on the last occasion I was advised that the
prisoner did not intend
to remain resident at the Sydney Central Hotel. Her
sole income is the disability pension and the hotel was too costly. The matter
was stood over with the prisoner's bail continued subject to her accepting the
reasonable direction of a representative of the St
Vincent de Paul Society who
indicated a willingness to assist with her care in the interim.  
<P>

27   	I have determined that this case falls into the
exceptional category of cases where a non-custodial sentence is appropriate
in
respect of a conviction for manslaughter. This is not a case where the
deceased's death was brought about by the deliberate act
of the prisoner. Her
failure to obtain medical assistance was a continuing one and callous however
that  must be evaluated in the
context of her level of intellectual
functioning.
<P>

28   	I note that Dr Lucire observed in the course of her report
that this prisoner's capacity to do community service is limited.
I have little
difficulty in accepting that to be the case. This was not a case where either
the defence or the Crown submitted I
should give consideration to alternative
sentencing options such as community service or periodic detention. It was for
this reason
that no pre-sentence report was sought.   
<P>

29   	In all the circumstances I consider that an appropriate
sentence is a lengthy recognisance conditioned upon acceptance of
the
supervision of the Probation and Parole Service.  The prisoner does appear
capable of complying with whatever reporting conditions
that Service deems
appropriate.  
<P>

30   	Susan Maria Hall, you are convicted of the manslaughter of
Gary Henderson.  I defer passing sentence upon you and order your
release upon
you entering into a recognisance without surety in the amount of $300 to be of
good behaviour for a period of five years
and to come up for sentence if called
upon.  It is a condition of this recognisance that you accept the supervision
and direction
of the Probation and Parole Service.  You are to report to the
Sydney office of the Probation and Parole Service within 72 hours
of your
release on this recognisance.
<P>

31   	I turn now to the case of Colin George Hanslow.  Mr
Hanslow pleaded guilty at the first opportunity to an offence of being
an
accessory after the fact to the malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm
upon Gary Henderson.  The maximum penalty in respect
of this offence is one of
five years penal servitude.  I take into account not only Mr Hanslow's plea of
guilty at the first opportunity
but also the circumstance that he entered that
plea at a time when the Crown had not determined whether to proceed in relation
to
the more serious offence of manslaughter. I view the plea as evidencing a
real degree of contrition having regard to that circumstance.
<P>

32   	A report from Dr Westmore, psychiatrist, was tendered on
the prisoner Colin Hanslow's behalf.  I have found that report most
helpful.
<P>

33   	Mr Hanslow, in contrast to his co-accused Colin Simpson
and Susan Hall, is not described as suffering from any intellectual
deficit.
However, I do note that Dr Westmore describes him in these terms:
<P>

"His speech was slow and I gained the impression that he was of dull
intelligence." 
<P>

34   	He is a man of 43 years.  He has been engaged in a
long-term relationship with his co-accused, Susan Hall.  Mr Hanslow described
an unhappy childhood associated with periods of time spent in institutions.  He
has a quite lengthy criminal history commencing when
he was aged only ten
years. He told Dr Westmore that he had spent time in juvenile facilities in
Mittagong, Dharruk and Mt Penang.
 His schooling was limited. The criminal
record reflects his account of a disturbed and unhappy childhood; while still a
juvenile
there are entries for being under the influence of alcohol on railway
property and vagrancy.
<P>

35   	The prisoner's criminal record continued in his adult life
and includes convictions for offences of dishonesty. Most significantly
in
October 1979 he was charged with an offence of `conspiracy to commit armed
robbery' for which he was later convicted by the District
Court at Parramatta
and sentenced to a term of three years penal servitude with a non parole period
of twelve months. The record
does not assist the prisoner however I do note
that since his release from custody in 1982, following a conviction for the
theft
of a motor vehicle, his pattern of offending behaviour declined
significantly. This period of reduced criminal offending appears
to correspond
with the formation of his relationship with his co-accused, Susan Hall. 
<P>

36   	I note that this prisoner served twelve months and twenty
nine days in custody on remand prior to his release on bail with
respect to
this matter. Following his release it was a condition of his bail that he
report three times weekly to the officer in
charge of Mount Druitt Police
Station. He has done this without fail for the past two years.
<P>

37   	Mr Giddy who appears for Mr Hanslow has drawn attention to
Dr Westmore's opinion that Mr Hanslow may well have been a somewhat
passive
person in his relationship with Susan Hall and that he may have been
emotionally overwhelmed by Susan Hall and Colin Simpson
in combination.  Mr
Giddy notes, by reference to the evidence given by Raymond Neaves at committal
and the observations of the Kanizay
family made on the evening of 26 August
1996, that the prisoner presented as a quiet and passive individual somewhat
under the sway
of his de facto partner.  I accept that to be the case.  
<P>

38   	Mr Giddy also places emphasis on the evidence of Raymond
Neaves that during Simpson's assault on the deceased the prisoner
called out
for him to stop it on more than one occasion.  When Vanessa Jett called to the
caravan she saw the prisoner give the deceased
a cigarette when asked to do so
but that he was unwilling to give further cigarettes in the presence of Colin
Simpson and Susan Hall.

<P>

39   	I accept that the prisoner ineffectually sought to have
Colin Simpson break off the assault. I also accept that he showed
some kindness
to the deceased notwithstanding the social pressures on him, having regard to
the peculiar dynamics of the group, not
to do so. 
<P>

40   	In the light of Mr Hanslow's plea, and having regard to
the circumstance that he has spent over twelve months in custody in
relation to
this matter and accepting as I do that he endeavoured, at least verbally, to
have Colin Simpson desist from his attack
on the deceased, I am of the view
that this is an appropriate case in which I should impose a non-custodial
penalty.  
<P>

41   	I note that Dr Westmore is of the opinion that Mr Hanslow
would benefit from psychological counselling which might assist
him in
understanding the role that his passivity played in the subject events.  I
propose releasing the prisoner upon recognisance
conditioned that he accept the
supervision and direction of the Probation and Parole Service.  The question of
counselling can be
addressed by that Service if it is considered appropriate.

<P>

42   	Colin George Hanslow, you are convicted of the offence of
being an accessory after the fact to the malicious infliction of
grievous
bodily harm upon Gary Henderson between 19 August 1996 and 26 August 1996.  I
defer passing sentence upon you and order
your release upon you entering into a
recognisance without surety in the amount of $300 to be of good behaviour for a
period of two
years and to come up for sentence if called upon.  This
recognisance is conditioned upon you accepting the supervision and direction
of
the Probation and Parole Service.  You are to report to the Blacktown office of
the Probation and Parole Service within 72 hours
of your release upon this
recognisance.
