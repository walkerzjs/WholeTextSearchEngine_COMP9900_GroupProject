<center><u>JUDGMENT</u></center>
<P>


<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR: This matter is brought to the Court by way of a
motion for contempt.  It seems to me there is an underlying issue
as to how
certain questions relating to the accounts of the former firm of accountants
should be resolved. Therefore, from the time
this matter started and really
until it came to the question of costs, the debate turned upon how those issues
which there are between
the plaintiffs and defendants should be determined.
<P>

2   		The problem arose out of certain terms of settlement which
in pars 9 and 10 provided:
<P>

"9.	<i>A balance sheet and profit and loss account will be prepared for
Forsythes (Old) as at 28 August 1994 on an accruals basis and once
accepted by
all parties will be binding thereon other than as adjusted in 8.</i>
<P>

<i>10.	On or before 31 December 1994, the parties shall jointly engage, and pay
in the proportions of their interests in Forsythes (Old)
at 28 August 1994, the
services of Rob Knights &amp; Co, Chartered Accountants of Sydney, or in the
event of him being unable or
unwilling to so act, a valuer appointed by the NSW
State Chairman of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia, to value
the goodwill of the accountancy practice and associated entities of Forsythes
(Old), excluding the HMC Unit Trust, Forsythes Computer
Systems Pty Ltd and
Back to Basics Business Services Pty Ltd.</i>
<P>

<i>The basis upon which the valuation is to be conducted is that of a willing
but not anxious buyer and a willing but not anxious seller,
with the seller
being prepared to enter into reasonable covenants not to compete. The above
valuation will be based solely upon the
trading results of Forsythes (Old) for
the year ended 30 June 1994. Settlement for the amount owing to the Retiring
Partners, representing
their share of the goodwill, will be in accordance with
the Settlement Payment.</i>"
<P>

Clause 26 of the agreement provided for the arbitration of any matter which
could not be resolved by the parties.
<P>

3   		Some other issues came before the Court and, on 18
September 1997, Einstein J ordered, inter alia:
<P>

"<i>By consent, the court now orders the written agreement between the
plaintiffs and the first and second defendants made on 10 September
1994 be
specifically performed and carried into execution. The Court further orders
that the first and second defendants do all things,
including the review and
acceptance of the financial accounts of Forsythes (Old) for the year ended 30
June 1994 and the period ending
28 August 1994 and execute all documents
necessary to give effect to the order for specific performance earlier
made.</i>"
<P>

In my view, that order was not unclear or ambiguous and, in my view, it related
to cll 9 and 10 of the settlement agreement and
it required that accounts for
Forsythes (Old), that is the old partnership before termination of which the
plaintiffs and defendants
were members, be drawn up and accepted.  The
acceptance was necessary because terms of the settlement depended thereon.
<P>

4   		That order was made in November 1997 and practically
nothing has occurred since then to implement the order of his Honour.
<P>

5   		The plaintiffs prepared their own accounts and submitted
them to the defendants and, in the first instance, they treated the
matter as
if the defendants were entitled to put forward their objections.  In a letter
of 2 August 1998, they noted that they understood
that there were a few minor
aspects of the accounts to be addressed. That letter was responded to on 25
August 1998 when the defendants'
solicitors wrote to say that their clients
were preparing their own accounts in a format which they submitted was proper
and that
this was likely to take some time and they hoped to be in a position
to consent to a timetable by which their clients anticipated
they would be able
to submit a proper version of the accounts.  
<P>

6   		It was after that that the matter came to what appears to
have been a halt.  The defendants' solicitors seem to have taken
the view that
the accounts could not be finalised during the existence of what was called the
Page litigation.  There had been litigation
between Mr Page and members of an
earlier form of the Forsythes firm. 
<P>

7   		On 4 September 1998, the solicitors for the defendants
wrote to say that because of the litigation there was now a contingent
liability against Forsythes (Old) and they suggested that settlement of the
accounts be postponed until the Page proceedings had
been finalised. That view
was not agreed to by the plaintiffs.  On 25 November 1998, the defendants'
solicitors wrote again to say:
<P>

"... <i>our clients dispute that it is possible to review and accept the
accounts due to the potential impact of the Page proceedings. Notwithstanding
what your client may think, our clients point to AAS 8  in support of that
proposition.</i>"
<P>

8   		The plaintiffs' solicitors, who were wishing to pursue the
matter and to have the accounts finalised, commenced speaking of
contempt
proceedings and ultimately these present proceedings were brought.
<P>

9   		The proceedings, in the form in which they were brought,
were in my opinion misguided, for they sought an order that the first
defendant
and second defendant be ordered to accept forthwith the financial accounts of
Forsythes (Old) for the years ended 30 June
1994 in the form of the accounts
which had been prepared by the plaintiffs, and a similar order in relation to
the accounts for the
period ending 28 August 1994. 
<P>

10   		In my opinion, the defendants were not under any
obligation to accept the accounts prepared by the plaintiffs.  The effect
of
the settlement agreement was that accounts had to be drawn up by the old
partnership, that means by all partners in the old partnership,
and therefore
that the accounts had to be agreed to by them.  It followed in my opinion that,
if there was a dispute about the accounts,
it was a dispute that had to go to
arbitration so that an arbitrator could settle the accounts as at 30 June 1994
and 28 August 1994.
 
<P>

11   		So I am of the view that the form in which the motion was
expressed was misguided and based upon a misapprehension. However,
I am also of
the view that, having regard to the time that had passed and to the attitude
taken by the defendants, it was a proper
course for the plaintiffs to bring the
matter before the Court so that the problems which they were facing could be
resolved and
so that the orders made by Einstein J could be progressed.
<P>

12   		The matter has been debated and the parties here today
are now agreed that the issue of the accounts will go to arbitration
and there
is a form of order as to this before me which I now initial and date. I make
that order.
<P>

13   		That leaves the question of the motion for contempt.  It
is not in doubt and I do not think Mr Underwood, counsel for the
plaintiffs,
alleges to the contrary, that that motion should be dismissed and I shall make
that order.
<P>

14   		Then there is the question of costs.  When the matter
first commenced on Monday I was of the view that a possible order as
to costs
might be that the costs be reserved to see how the arbitration turns out and to
see whether the delay that occurred can
be put really to the fault of one side
or the other or whether the plaintiffs' accounts are going to be accepted as
substantially
correct or whether the views put by the defendants are going to
be accepted.  However, that approach has been opposed by Mr Ashhurst
who
appears today for the defendants and I have now heard an argument on the
question of costs. Having done so I think I should not
reserve costs.
<P>

15   		I have to take into account principally two things.  One,
that the motion for contempt was misconceived.  The second is that
this was a
proper matter to bring before the Court so as to progress it. There was an
issue between the parties, the parties could
not resolve it, and an order of a
judge was required.
<P>

16   		Having regard to the totality of those circumstances I
think the proceedings have achieved real progress in the sense that
they have
achieved an agreement between the parties as to how this matter will go
forward.  I am of the view that that result was
worth the bringing of the
proceedings and, notwithstanding that they were wrong in form, I must take that
into account.  I think
the fairest thing is in the result that each party
should pay his or her own costs of the motion.
<P>
