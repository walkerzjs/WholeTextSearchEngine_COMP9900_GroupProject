<b><u>10728/99  -  DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS  v  C. O'G</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR :<b>  </b> From 7 pm on 28 September 1997 until
7 am on the following day Walter Hufschmid was the person in charge of land
known as Drivers
Triangle which was enclosed by cyclone wire fencing and
entrance gates to which were attached rows of barbed wire.  Drivers Triangle
was incorporated within the scope of works then being undertaken for
construction of the (Sydney) Eastern Distributor carriageway.
 Mr Hufschmid was
employed by a security company which contracted with the road builders.  The
owner of the land was the Centennial
and Moore Park Trust (the Trust) and it
had by written agreement granted licence to enter and use an area including
Drivers Triangle
to the Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales (RTA).
Pursuant to a complex of various agreements which it is unnecessary
for present
purposes to elaborate the workforces of entities engaged in the construction
and collateral activity were authorized
to enter the land.  
<P>

2   	At about 5.40 am on 29 September 1997 Mr Hufschmid noticed
four persons including the respondent (a juvenile) on the jib of
machinery at
the site.  They had secured themselves with chains and the like.  They were not
part of the workforce authorized to
enter the land.  They refused a request by
Mr Hufschmid that they quit the property.  Eventually police were called and
the respondent
and the others were removed by the Rescue Squad.  
<P>

3   	An information was laid against the respondent charging an
offence against <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ilpa1901264/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ilpa1901264/" class="autolink_findacts">Inclosed Lands Protection Act</a> in that he :
<P>

".... without lawful excuse did enter the inclosed lands of the Roads and
Traffic Authority, situate the Eastern Distributor construction
site, Drivers
Triangle, without the consent of the person apparently in charge of the
same."
<P>

4   	On 12 February 1998 at Bidura Children's Court the learned
presiding magistrate dismissed the information.  The informant appealed
by way
of stated case wherein were set out the grounds of his Worship's determination
namely:
<P>

"a)	On 12.2.98 I accepted a defence submission that because the information
alleged the defendant `did enter onto the enclosed lands
of the RTA' pursuant
to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ilpa1901264/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ilpa1901264/" class="autolink_findacts">Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901</a>, the prosecution had
to prove as an essential element of its case that the subject land was `of the
Roads and Traffic Authority'.
<P>

b)	I found that a licence granted by the Centennial and Moore Park Trust to the
Roads and Traffic Authority did not entitle the
Roads and Traffic Authority to
exclusive possession of the licensed area.
<P>

c)	I found that the subject land in this case was not `of the RTA' because the
Roads and Traffic Authority did not have an exclusive
right to possession of
that land.
<P>

d)	I accordingly ruled that the prosecution had not established a prima facie
case and I therefore dismissed the information."
<P>

5   	Within the case the appellant's contentions are set out in
these terms:
<P>

"I erred in law:
<P>

a)	in the construction of the word `of' as it occurs in the phrase `did enter
onto the inclosed lands of' in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ilpa1901264/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ilpa1901264/" class="autolink_findacts">Inclosed Lands Protection
Act 1901</a>.
<P>

b)	in holding that the word `of' as it occurs in the phrase `did enter onto the
inclosed lands of' in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ilpa1901264/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 4(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ilpa1901264/" class="autolink_findacts">Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901</a> is
restricted to proprietary interests in the land or interests conferring an
entitlement to exclusive possession of the land.
<P>

c)	in dismissing the information."
<P>

6   	Pursuant to notice dated 10 May 1999 the Director of Public
Prosecutions has taken over the appeal.  As stated the case raises
a relatively
short point concerning the construction of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ilpa1901264/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s4(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ilpa1901264/" class="autolink_findacts">Inclosed Lands
Protection Act</a> namely whether the expression therein "the inclosed lands of any
other person" should be construed to mean that that person has either
a
proprietary interest or an exclusive right to possession of those inclosed
lands.  I reject that construction.  
<P>

7   	In the context of the section "any other person"
distinguishes that person from the alleged unlawful entrant: cf <b>Maric v
Thompson</b>, Supreme Court, (Mathews J) unreported 23 February 1990. The
learned magistrate expressed reliance upon <b>Cowell v Rosehill Racecourse
Company Limited</b> 1936 56 CLR 605, particularly per Latham CJ @ 617.  There
is nothing in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ilpa1901264/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s4(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ilpa1901264/" class="autolink_findacts">Inclosed Lands Protection Act</a> to suggest that the
scope of its protection is limited to those who hold interests in land as
distinct from, for example, contractual
licensees in actual occupancy of land.
The issue in <b>Cowell</b>  was a ruling on demurrer to a reply sought to be
relied upon by the plaintiff in an action for assault who had been met with a
defence
that lawful force was applied to remove him as a trespasser.  The reply
asserted payment to the defendant for leave and licence to
enter and remain on
the land.  There was judgment for the defendant on demurrer.  In the course of
judgment the Chief Justice discussed
the distinction between proprietary
interests and contractual rights to enter land.  His remarks are not germane to
construction
of the phrase "of any other person" appearing in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ilpa1901264/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s4(1)</a> and the
conclusion in the court below is not supported by that authority.
<P>

8   	At the hearing of the appeal, argument was more detailed
and in deference to counsel's adversions I should make reference to
them.
<P>

9   	The nature of the right of the RTA ceded by the Licence
Agreement was explored.  I extract some of the provisions of the agreement:
<P>

"3.1	<b>Grant</b>
<P>

Subject to this Deed, the Trust grants and the RTA accepts a non-exclusive
licence to enter and use the Licensed Area for the Term
for the Licence
Purposes.
<P>

3.2	<b>Nature</b>
<P>

(a)	The licence granted under this Deed is personal to the RTA and does not
create a tenancy or any other estate or interest in
the Licensed Area.  Nothing
in this Deed entitles the RTA to exclusive possession of the Licensed Area.
<P>

5.1	<b>Access Times</b>
<P>

	Subject to this Deed, the RTA has access to the Licensed Area 24 hours a day,
7 days per week for the Licence Purposes.  The RTA
must not use the Licensed
Area for any activity which is not contemplated by the Licence Purposes.
<P>

5.2	<b>Trust's right to enter</b>
<P>

(a)	at all reasonable times, give to the Director and all persons authorised by
the Director access to the Licensed Area; and
<P>

(b)	provide the Trust with every reasonable facility for the examination and
testing of any thing on or near the Licensed Area.
<P>

10   	The particulars within the information specified the
relevant inclosed lands as being "of the Roads and Traffic Authority".
 The
terms of agreement above set out recognize the occupation of the land by the
RTA, indeed, as counsel submitted, the declarations
in clause 5.2 would only
become necessary in the context of occupation by the RTA.  In my view the RTA
had a sufficient right in
connection with the lands for them to be described as
being "of the RTA".  For the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ilpa1901264/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4(1)</a> that right need not amount to
an interest in the land and a contractual right suffices.  
<P>

11   	Senior counsel for the respondent acknowledging (at least
tacitly) that the issue was not raised by the stated case, pointed
to the
specification in the information "without the consent of the person apparently
in charge" and the statute which refers to
the absence of consent of the owner
or occupier or person apparently in charge.  He argued that to prove an offence
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ilpa1901264/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4(1)</a> it would be incumbent upon the prosecution to prove the absence of
consent of anybody from each of those categories.  Commonly one
person would be
owner, occupier and in charge but it was contended that specification of only
one of those categories, in this case
the person apparently in charge, was bad
as proof of the absence of only that person's consent would be insufficient to
establish
guilt.  I would not uphold that argument.  I would construe the
relevant words of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ilpa1901264/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 4(1)</a> as creating potential offences for entry without
consent of a person in any one of the categories mentioned and would regard
this
as in conformity with the use of the disjunctive "or".  It is true that
(assuming they are different) in a given case an entrant
may not have the
consent of, for example, the occupier but have the consent of the owner but
such circumstance would meet the criterion
of lawful excuse.  I do not accept
that the principles of construction of penal provisions in a statute require
the extended proof
contended by counsel.
<P>

12   	The question asked in the Stated Case whether the
determination was erroneous in law should be answered in the affirmative.
<P>

13   	At the conclusion of the hearing it was indicated that the
parties would wish to be heard on the question of costs.  I make
no order and
grant liberty to apply in respect thereof.
