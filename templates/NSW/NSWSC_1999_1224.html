<b><u>70051/98  -  REGINA  v  Trevor Charles DUTHIE</u></b>
<P>

<b>SENTENCE</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  Trevor Charles Duthie is for sentence
today having pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Jason Moylan. The prisoner
was indicted
on a charge of murdering Jason Moylan but the Crown has accepted
his plea of guilty to manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment.
In
my view for reasons which will emerge, properly so.
<P>

2   	The basis upon which the Crown accepted the plea of
manslaughter was that at the time when the prisoner killed Jason Moylan
his
responsibility for his actions was diminished by an abnormality of mind. The
maximum penalty prescribed by the <b>Crimes Act</b> 1900 for the crime of
manslaughter is twenty-five years penal servitude.
<P>

3   	I turn then to the objective facts of the matter. In
determining those facts I have adopted the criminal standard of proof,
namely
proof beyond reasonable doubt. I should add that there is no disputation as to
the circumstances which led to the prisoner
killing Jason Moylan.
<P>

4   	On Saturday, 21 February 1998 Jason Moylan and the prisoner
were inmates at the Silverwater Metropolitan Remand Centre. Both
were on
remand. Jason Moylan was facing a charge of larceny and had been bail refused
at Wollongong Local Court on 20 February 1998
on the basis that he was in
breach of bail conditions relating to an earlier offence and that he had a
history of failing to appear.
<P>

5   	The prisoner had been remanded to Silverwater for an
alleged breach of an apprehended violence order involving his female partner.
Both Jason Moylan and the prisoner had past criminal records and had met while
previously in gaol. Apparently they had become friendly.
<P>

6   	Immediately prior to their incarceration both had been
ingesting drugs. Both apparently had been in a disturbed state when
admitted to
Silverwater. It appears that both had been administered the tranquilliser,
Valium, on admission. Indeed the autopsy carried
out on Jason Moylan found the
remanets of a therapeutic dose of Valium and traces of cannabis in his
blood.
<P>

7   	The prisoner in his ERISP claimed he had been administered
Valium at about 7.30 pm on 21 February 1998. At an earlier interview
at
Silverwater with the police, the prisoner stated that he, at the relevant time,
was suffering from what he described as speed
psychosis which I would interpret
as being that he was suffering from amphetamine withdrawal symptoms.
<P>

8   	On the morning of Saturday, 21 February 1998 Jason Moylan
had indicated to prison authorities that he was feeling disturbed
which caused
the prison authorities to have an Aboriginal Liaison inmate, a Mr Kemp, speak
with Jason Moylan - Jason Moylan being
an aboriginal.
<P>

9   	Mr Kemp attempted to comfort Jason Moylan as best he could.
He in fact saw him twice during the course of the day. On the second
occasion,
Mr Kemp observed Jason Moylan in a very bad emotional state and expressed a
desire to Mr Kemp that he wished Kemp to "get
me out of here". This request, Mr
Kemp felt was for Jason Moylan to be moved to an area with other aboriginal
inmates.
<P>

10   	In the event, the authorities placed Jason Moylan with the
prisoner whom as I have said, he knew and apparently was on friendly
relations,
in the same cell. 
<P>

11   	The relevant undisputed facts were then given by Det Snr
Const Platten who was in charge of the investigation. They are as
follows:
<P>

12   	At 11.09 pm on Saturday, 21 February 1998 the prisoner
rang the "alarm buzzer" from Cell 84 in Darcy POD 2, Silverwater Metropolitan
Remand Centre. Correctives officers then answered the bell and the prisoner
replied "I have just killed my cell mate."
<P>

13   	Corrections staff then attended Cell 84 and when they
entered the cell the deceased was on the bed beneath a prison sheet.
When
questioned by Corrections staff as to what happened, the prisoner stated, "He
said he wanted to die chief so I fixed it up for
him."
<P>

14   	Flemington Detectives and Crime Scene were then called and
attended the scene. Inquiries revealed the prisoner and the deceased
were
secured in the cell together after dinner at 4.20 pm on 21 February 1998.
<P>

15   	Flemington detectives immediately questioned the prisoner
as to his involvement and he indicated that it was a suicide pact
gone wrong.
The prisoner stated that he and the deceased wanted to kill themselves by
suffocation, but this did not work so the prisoner
used a shoe lace to tie up
the deceased's arms and legs so as he could not struggle and resist the
suffocation. The prisoner then
stated that he strangled the deceased around the
neck with a shoe lace. This conversation was recorded on an audio tape
recorder.
<P>

16   	Further investigations revealed that the deceased and the
prisoner were good friends and had only been placed in a cell together
that
day. The prisoner and deceased received Valium at approximately 7.30 pm that
date.
<P>

17   	Numerous statements were obtained from Corrections staff
and a canvass was conducted of the inmates in POD 2, Darcy cell.
Forensic
pathologists and Aborigine Death Watch personnel attended the scene and
conducted their investigations.
<P>

18   	Various crime scene investigations revealed a struggle had
taken place and that the crime scene had been cleaned up by the
prisoner after
the death. A number of suicide notes purported to be inscribed by the deceased
and the prisoner were located in the
cell. Further inquiries revealed that the
deceased had been aggressive towards Corrections officers at midday on 21
February 1998
and reports to this effect have been taken into police
possession.
<P>

19   	Arrangements were then made for a Section 29 order to
convey the prisoner to Flemington police station after arrest so as
detention
after arrest legislative requirements could be adhered to.
<P>

20   	About 7 am on 22 February 1998 the prisoner was taken to
Flemington police station and placed in police custody. The prisoner
obtained
legal advice from his solicitor's representative regarding interviews by
ERISP.
<P>

21   	A short time later Flemington detectives conducted an
ERISP with the prisoner. The prisoner stated and reasoned that his actions
were
voluntary and that he was practicing euthanasia at the request of the deceased.
The prisoner stated that they were both affected
by drugs and that they both
wanted to kill themselves. The prisoner stated that he wanted to kill himself
because his wife had set
him up for arrest by police.
<P>

22   	During the ERISP the prisoner became very aggressive
towards the interviewing detectives. The interview continued and the
prisoner
regained his composure. The prisoner was adamant that his actions were
voluntary and merely at the request of the deceased.
The prisoner could not
explain why the deceased was depressed and wanted to die, and stated he did not
call for assistance immediately
because he did not want to be a dog - prison
parlance for persons who assist authority.
<P>

23   	The prisoner stated that after he tied the hands and legs
of the deceased he strangled him by holding a shoe lace around his
neck for
some minutes watching him struggle and wiggle around before dying. The prisoner
stated that he then sat down and prayed
with the deceased and then went to
sleep for possibly a couple of hours.
<P>

24   	The prisoner stated that he undid the shoe laces and socks
from the body of the deceased after waking up. After removal of
laces and
socks, the prisoner stated that he then placed a blanket over the deceased.
<P>

25   	The time of the act of strangulation appears to be 8 pm.
The prisoner summonsed the buzzer at 11.09 pm.
<P>

26   	The autopsy report found that the deceased died as a
result of ligature strangulation and not by way of hanging. A number
of scratch
marks on the neck of the deceased were also found and that this was consistent
with some form of struggle. As I have already
noted, results reveal a
therapeutic does of Valium and a trace of cannabis. 
<P>

27   	Having read the letters left by the deceased in the cell
and the notice apparently co-authored by both Jason Moylan and the
prisoner I
have no doubt that in fact it was the intention of both to suicide. Once the
prisoner had killed Jason Moylan he did not
have the will to carry out his side
of the bargain.
<P>

28   	I accept that the prisoner believed that what he was
carrying out was an act of euthanasia. I hasten to add that euthanasia
is not a
defence in this State to a crime involving unlawful homicide.
<P>

29   	I turn then to the subjective matters relating to the
prisoner.
<P>

30   	He is now thirty-five years of age having been born on 11
July 1964. He has a very long criminal record involving many periods
in which
he was in custody. While most of the entries in his record involve offences of
theft, drug offences and serious driving
offences they also include offences
involving violence including those being armed with intent to commit an
indictable offence, assault
occasioning actual bodily harm and a conviction for
carrying a cutting weapon.
<P>

31   	The history of his offending goes back over many years and
that his offences occurred with alarming regularity. He has in
fact spent a
good portion of his adult life in custody for the type of offences I have
referred to.
<P>

32   	While trained in mechanics and sign writing he has not
been able to hold down a job for any length of time because of his
repeated
episodes of incarceration.
<P>

33   	Dr Finlay-Jones, psychiatrist, whose report is before the
court, notes that the longest job the prisoner could recall holding
down was as
a manager of what is colloquially known as a swingers club at Blacktown.
<P>

34   	As far as his physical health is concerned he has been
hepatitis C positive for the past decade. At the time when he was arrested
for
the breach of the apprehended violence order, marijuana plants were found at
his home and in fact he was sentenced to a fixed
term of six months on 20 July
1998 as a consequence of that discovery. That last sentence expired on 9
January this year.
<P>

35   	He has never married and the most serious relationship he
had engaged in was that which ultimately led to his partner obtaining
the
apprehended violence order which in turn led to his incarceration which then
led to the commission of the present crime.
<P>

36   	His father died in 1979 of lung cancer. His relationship
with his father was not good. In histories to various psychiatrists,
the
prisoner has indicated that his father was a violent man. Again and I glean
this matter from the psychiatric reports, his relationship
between himself and
his six siblings is not good. The difficulties stemming from the prisoner's
criminal record. There is thus very
little in his past history which can be
used in mitigation of sentence.
<P>

37   	More relevant to this issue is the prisoner's psychiatric
condition. Before the court are reports from three psychiatrists,
Drs
Finlay-Jones, Nielssen and Westmore. All are agreed having regard to the
histories taken and their clinical observations that
the prisoner suffers from
schizophrenia and that the condition is chronic.
<P>

38   	All are agreed that at the relevant time the prisoner was
suffering from that abnormality of mind which led them to believe
that his
responsibility for his actions in killing Jason Moylan was diminished to the
requisite extent for the purposes of the law
as it then stood at the relevant
time. It is for this reason I am of the view that the Crown's acceptance of the
plea to manslaughter
was entirely proper.
<P>

39   	Dr Finlay-Jones indeed went so far as to suggest that the
prisoner had a total defence under the M'Naughton rules. Drs Nielssen
and
Westmore did not agree with that latter proposition.
<P>

40   	Indeed, the absence of any reference to hallucinations, or
any other form of delusion, at the relevant time, in the interview
he had with
police soon after the lethal event or in his histories given to psychiatrists,
are, in my view, indicative that the views
of Drs Westmore and Nielssen are to
be preferred in this regard.
<P>

41   	The prisoner has been in custody from the time of the
lethal event to the present day. He has, during this time, been subjected
to
treatment for his psychiatric symptoms within the prison hospital system.
<P>

42   	It is relevant to note that two psychologist who have seen
him, Professor Susan Hayes and Mr A Sevitt both place him as having
only
borderline intelligence. 
<P>

43   	Initially, when he came within the care of the prison
hospital system difficulty was experienced in determining whether certain
delusional episodes from which he then suffered were related to his past use of
amphetamines (which apparently was extensive) or
an underlying condition of
schizophrenia.
<P>

44   	It seems that once it was determined that schizophrenia
was the preferred diagnosis, appropriate treatment was commenced and
in fact
still continues. Happily that treatment has been of benefit to the prisoner.
Hospital notes tendered are indicative of that
improvement.
<P>

45   	Dr Westmore, who saw him on 25 August 1999 observed:
<P>

<i>"He is currently under psychiatric care and this obviously should continue.
He appears to be receiving appropriate psychiatric treatment
and is responding
in an anticipated way to that treatment."</i>
<P>

46   	A report dated 18 November 1999 from Kerrie Kirkwood an
alcohol and other drug worker at Long Bay Hospital is in the following
terms:
<P>

<i>"The prisoner has sought the support the Alcohol &amp; Other Drug Service in
the Long Bay hospital since December 1998. Since this
time he has willingly
participated in weekly counselling sessions.</i>
<P>

<i>The prisoner has a long history of drug use and has taken positive steps to
address the issues relating to and resulting from his
drug related behaviour.
During counselling sessions the prisoner demonstrates motivation and
continually presents in an appropriate
and polite manner.</i>
<P>

47   	Accordingly, the prisoner`s prospects of rehabilitation
are brighter than perhaps one would have anticipated having regard
to his past
history.
<P>

48   	The court is thus presented with a prisoner, whom to
paraphrase Dr Westmore's report was suffering from an abnormality of
mind which
was due to paranoid schizophrenia illness, had a drug induced withdrawal state
and was of dull intellect overlaid by his
mental illness which subsequently
impaired his capacity at the time of the homicide.
<P>

49   	Since the commission of the crime he has made substantial
progress under the care being administered to him in the prison
hospital.
<P>

50   	I have read the victim impact statements provided by the
victim's mother. That statement underscores the depth of the tragic
effect upon
her of the death of her son and the court expresses sympathy both to her and to
her family on their tragic loss. However,
for reasons detailed by Hunt CJ at CL
in <b>R v Previtera</b> unreported, 27 May 1997 I cannot take into account the
contents of the victim impact statements in coming to my conclusion as to
what
is the appropriate sentence in this case.
<P>

51   	The prisoner's need to have on going psychiatric treatment
which will properly last for the rest of his life is a compelling
reason for
finding that this is a case where I should find special circumstances for the
purposes of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></b> and this I do. This means that the
proportion between the minimum and additional terms will be varied from the
proportion prescribed
by the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></b>.
<P>

52   	In determining sentence in this matter, the combination of
the prisoner's borderline intelligence and underlying mental condition
(both of
which I have found existed at the time of the commission of the offence) are
such that general deterrence can but be given
little weight in this case. See
<b>R v Scognamiglio</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1991%2056%20A%20Crim%20R%2081%2d86" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1991 56 A Crim R 81-86.</a>
<P>

53   	I also take into account the prisoner's guilty plea which
was given at the first appropriate occasion. That plea is indicative
of a
manifestation of remorse and contrition on the prisoner's part. I also take
into account the pragmatic ground that his plea
saves time and expense. See
<b>R v Bennetts</b> unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 17 June 1993 per
Gleeson CJ.
<P>

54   	This is an extraordinary case. The prisoner's action in
killing his victim was not motivated by anger or any of the other
matters
usually associated with the crime of this nature. It was motivated by a
misguided notion that to do so would constitute an
act of euthanasia and in
circumstances where a suicide pact had been entered into between two drug
affected persons, one of whom
(the prisoner) had an underlying mental
condition.
<P>

55   	However, the fact remains that a human life has been taken
and that while this case is not one which calls for a sentence
at the upper
range of sentences given for the crime of manslaughter the matter still calls
for the imposition of a custodial sentence.
<P>

56   	While manslaughter is a protean crime See <b>R v Hill</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1981%203%20A%20Crim%20R%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1981 3 A Crim R 397</a> at 402, the sentence must coincide with the demands of
criminal justice, particularly as I have said, here is a case where human
life
has been deliberately taken.
<P>

57   	As of today the prisoner has spent fifteen months and
twenty-five days in custody following his apprehension for this crime.
It seems
to me that the most appropriate way of dealing with the matter is for me to
nominate what I believe to be an appropriate
total sentence divided both as to
minimum and additional terms. Having regard to my finding as to special
circumstances and fixing
the sentence from today, deduct from the minimum term,
which otherwise would be set, the time already spent in custody for this
crime.
<P>

58   	In my view the appropriate head sentence is one of penal
servitude for eight years consisting of a minimum term of five years
plus an
additional term of three years dating from today. Making the deduction for the
time already served the ultimate sentence
will be constructed as follows:
<P>

59   	A minimum term of three years eight months and five days
commencing today, 15 December 1999 and expiring on 20 July 2003 when
the
prisoner will be eligible for release on parole and an additional term of three
years commencing 21 July 2003 and expiring on
20 July 2006.
