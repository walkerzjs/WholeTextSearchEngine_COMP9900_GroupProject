THURSDAY 20 MAY 1999
<P>

<u>12355/1990</u>	<u>ABA-SOLD PTY LTD ACN 002 437 498 v COMMONWEALTH BANK OF
AUSTRALIA ACN 123 123 124</u>
<P>

<u>21484/1996</u>	<u>ABA-SOLD PTY LTD ACN 002 437 498 v COMMONWEALTH BANK OF
AUSTRALIA ACN 123 123 124</u>
<P>

<u>JUDGMENT</u>
<P>

1	The plaintiff has instituted two proceedings against the defendant.  The
first was commenced by the filing of a Statement of Claim
on 24 May 1990.  The
second was commenced by a Statement of Claim filed on 25 November 1996.  The
relief sought in the process has
been said to overlap.
<P>

2	In each proceeding, the plaintiff has filed an Amended Statement of Claim.
As process had not been served, the pleadings were
amended without consent or
leave.
<P>

3	The original 1990 process propounded a claim for damages founded on breach of
duty.  The amended process added new allegations.
 Relief was sought in respect
of moneys allegedly paid under the mistaken belief that the defendant was
entitled to the payments
as a matter of law and it was alleged that the Bank
acted unconscionably and was unjustly enriched.  There is a claim for damages
and interest.  There is also a claim made in respect of the sum of
$492,504-82.
<P>

4	The 1996 process also sought the recovery of the sum of $492,504-82.  The
amended process restricted the claim to that part of
the sum of $492,504-82 as
was paid by the plaintiff to the defendant on or after 25 November 1990.  The
Court has been told that
this amendment was made to circumvent any potential
limitation period problem.
<P>

5	The amended process in both proceedings was filed in November 1998.  There
was purported service of the amended process in November
1998 (by letter to the
defendant).  The process in the 1990 proceedings was then stale (the purported
service took place many years
after the then two year period for validity of
service had expired).  It appears that an ex parte application was made to a
Duty
Registrar in Chambers on 31 December 1998.  He made an order to the effect
that the purported service of the process in the 1990
proceedings was confirmed
and approved.
<P>

6	As at 4 January 1999, the defendant had not filed a Notice of Appearance or a
Defence in either proceedings.  On 4 January 1999,
the plaintiff obtained the
entry of Default Judgment in both proceedings.  In each case, the judgment is
to the effect that the defendant
is liable to the plaintiff for damages and
costs and an order was made that the damages be assessed.  The defendant became
aware
of the Default Judgments on or about 12 January 1999.  The plaintiff
refused to consent to the setting aside of the judgments.
<P>

7	Later in January 1999, the defendant made application to the Court to have
inter alia both Default Judgments set aside.  The two
Notices of Motion came on
for hearing on 10 May 1999.  The application was supported by two affidavits
from Mr Stone (a bank officer)
and two affidavits from Mr Lanser (a solicitor).
The defendant also tendered documentation.  The plaintiff did not adduce any
evidence.
<P>

8	The proceedings arise out of certain foreign currency arrangements made in
the early 1980's.  The decline in the value of the
Australian dollar as against
the Swiss franc saw the plaintiff in default of its obligations thereunder  by
1991.
<P>

9	For present purposes it is common ground that the arrangements contained a
provision which is referred to as clause 8 (see Exhibit
RCS1).  It is common
ground that interest payable to the defendant under the arrangements was liable
to withholding tax.  It is also
common ground that the plaintiff had an
obligation to pay this tax, that it paid it to the defendant and the defendant
remitted it
to the Deputy Commission of Taxation.  Clause 8 (b) has been
referred to as a "grossing-up" provision.  It is a provision intended
to ensure
that the defendant received its full contractual entitlement to interest.
<P>

10	It is common ground that clause 8 is identical to the provision which came
under consideration in <u>David Securities Pty Limited &amp; Ors v Commonwealth
Bank of Australia</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/48.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 48</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=175%20CLR%20353" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">175 CLR 353</a> and is void by virtue of s 261 of the
<u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/" class="autolink_findacts">Income Tax Assessment Act</u> 1936</a>.
<P>

11	The question had been earlier dealt with by the Full Federal Court.  The
decision of that Court had been delivered on 10 May
1990.  This Court had held
that the provision was void.  The decision was in accord with then existing
authority (to the effect that
payments made under the void provisions were not
recoverable because they were made under mistake as to law).  Following that
decision,
there was an exchange of correspondence between the parties (see
annexures B and C to the affidavit sworn by Mr Stone on 5 May 1999).
 Annexure
"B" is a letter dated 4 July 1990 from Stacks (the solicitor for the
plaintiffs) to the defendant (which refers to a court
decision to the effect
that banks are not entitled to charge withholding tax in relation to foreign
exchange loans).  The decision
of the High Court was delivered in October 1992.
In that decision, the High Court held that a rule precluding recovery of moneys
paid under a mistake of law does not form part of the law in Australia.  On 19
February 1993, the parties made a Loan Facility Deed
(Exhibit RCS 3).  This
Deed effected a settlement of aspects of the disputes between the parties (see
clause 19).  There was a "side-letter"
to that Deed (see Annexure D to the
affidavit sworn by Mr Stone on 5 May 1999).  It purported to reserve the
plaintiff's rights to
institute proceedings in relation to past payments of
withholding tax.
<P>

12	The Court has a discretionary power to set aside a Default Judgment.  The
power is exercised having regard to the relevant circumstances
of the
particular case before it and so that justice is best served between the
parties.  The applicant bears the onus of demonstrating
an entitlement to
relief.
<P>

13	The applications have been vigorously opposed by the plaintiff.  The
plaintiff contends that the defendant has failed to demonstrate
that it has a
bona fide defence on the merits to either of the proceedings.
<P>

14	The defendant has prepared a draft Defence to the 1996 proceedings.  A copy
of that Defence has been admitted as Exhibit 4. 
If the judgments are set
aside, it is contemplated that a Defence along similar lines would be relied on
in the 1990 proceedings.
<P>

15	Broadly speaking, the plaintiff says that either the proposed Defences are
not available to the defendant or there is a lack
of evidence to show that they
are arguable.  It further says that the only evidence placed before the Court
is in the 1996 proceedings.
<P>

16	Before turning to the proposed Defences, it is necessary to first look at
the plaintiff's own process and the judgments that
have been obtained.  A
glance at these matters reveals a somewhat unhappy state of affairs.
<P>

17	As previously mentioned, the 1990 process propounds inter alia a claim for
damages founded on breach of duty.  At the time of
the purported service of the
amended process, the solicitor for the plaintiff advised that the plaintiff
would not be pressing this
claim (it is conceded that clause 19 of the Loan
Facility Deed is a good defence to it).  Despite this, Default Judgment was
then
obtained for the whole of the claim for damages to be assessed.  Arguably,
damages are not the appropriate remedy for that part of
the claim which is
pressed.  This part of the claim is said to be for the recovery of the moneys
paid pursuant to the "grossing-up"
provision.  The Court has been informed that
the plaintiff does not seek to recover the amounts remitted to the Deputy
Commission
of Taxation for withholding tax.  However, there is issue as to what
is actually sought to be recovered by the pleading itself. 
It may be read as
seeking the recovery of the payments for withholding tax.  There is material
(including an affidavit sworn by Mr
Stack) which suggests that this was the
purport of the claim.  The sum claimed ($492,504.82) is the figure attributed
to the amount
paid for withholding tax.  It is said that the claim for the
recovery of the "grossing-up" payments is slightly larger in fact but
that the
plaintiff is prepared to waive that excess.  If it can be read as a claim for
the "grossing-up" payment, the pleading may
be described as ambiguous and
embarrassing.  It may require amendment to found a judgment for the recovery of
moneys paid under the
"grossing-up" provision.  This claim is said to be
relevant for the period from 25 May 1984 to 24 May 1990.  It is conceded that
there may well be several small payments that were made prior to 25 May 1984
and that these would now be statute barred.
<P>

18	The position with the 1996 proceedings is beset with some similar problems.
It is also said to seek recovery of payments made
under the "grossing-up"
provision (being those relevant to the period 19 November 1990 to 18 November
1996).  This claim is pleaded
in terms similar to the like claim made in the
1990 process.  The relief sought does not include a claim for damages.  Despite
this,
the Default Judgment is for damages to be assessed.
<P>

19	The plaintiff sat on the process in both proceedings for lengthy periods.
In the case of the 1990 proceedings, it sat on the
process for about 8 years.
The purported service was irregular.  There was an attempt to cure the lack of
validity of service problem
in the 1990 proceedings by obtaining ex parte
relief from a Registrar in Chambers.  The defendant seeks to have that decision
reviewed.
 It may be that upon a review the decision could be disturbed.
However, at this stage, it would seem to be a pointless exercise to
undergo a
review process.  The purported service can be regarded as an irregularity under
s 81 of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</u> 1970</a>.  It may be that the defendant has
now lost the entitlement to apply to the Court to have that service set aside.
The Default Judgments
were obtained a few days after the Registrar's decision.
No notice of intention to move for Default Judgment was given to the defendant.
The plaintiff could have expected that its substantial claims would have been
the subject of purported defence by the defendant.
 Indeed, it seemed to be
clear to Mr Stack that the claims "would obviously be vigorously defended by
the defendant".  Ultimately
questions of default or delay were not agitated
during the hearing of these applications.  The defendant does advance material
to
explain default or delay.
<P>

20	The evidence reveals a defendant presently in a somewhat difficult
situation.  The arrangements between the parties involved
a large number of
roll-overs (these being occurrences at which withholding tax was paid).  There
seems to be about 221.  There are
files dating back to about 1982.  The last
roll-over was in about 1992 when the facilities were brought "on-shore".
Relevant documentation
is yet to be located (including some files and other
records).  Mr Poulter (who was the Chief General Manager (Corporate) in August
1990 has retired).  Contact is yet to be made with a potential witness or
source of instruction.
<P>

21	I now turn to the Defences which are sought to be agitated by the defendant.
The defendant seeks to put in issue the allegation
that payments were made
under a mistaken belief.  It says that payments were made voluntarily.  There
will be reliance placed on
inter alia the letter dated 4 July 1990.  It may
well be of considerable significance.  It is said that the plaintiff will have
difficulty
in demonstrating that there was a mistaken belief as to a legal
obligation to make at least those payments effected thereafter. 
It is also
said that in reliance upon receipt of the payments in good faith it changed its
position to its detriment.  These are
Defences recognised by <u>David
Securities</u> and are dependent on the evidence that can be relied on by the
defendant.  In addition to these matters, it looks to the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</u>
1969</a>.
<P>

22	Senior counsel for the plaintiff has taken the Court to many of the passages
in what was said in <u>David Securities</u> and has placed emphasis on the lack
of evidence to support the proposed Defences.  There is considerable force in
those submissions.
 But there is material which throws up at the very least the
real possibility that the defendant's contentions (or some of them)
are
meritorious.  The strength of at least some of the proposed Defences may depend
on the evidence that is ultimately available
to the defendant.  The present
position remains somewhat unclear.  I do not find it easy to evaluate.  The
defendant has not had
the benefit enjoyed by the plaintiff of a lengthy period
to consider its position.  The defendant (with some justification) seems
to
have laboured under the belief that the claim was for the recovery of payment
of withholding tax.  The "side-letter" may now be
seen as being of
significance.  At best the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></u> Defences may have minimal
application.
<P>

23	The existence of a bona fide defence is usually a relevant consideration.
However, each case is going to turn on its own particular
circumstances.  The
extent to which such a consideration may need to be demonstrated will vary from
case to case.  There will be
cases where relief is granted even though no such
consideration is made out.
<P>

24	It seems to me that questions of liability in both of these cases should be
allowed to go to trial.  The relevant questions will
be of complexity and the
defendant should be given the opportunity to defend the substantial claims made
by the plaintiff.  I bear
in mind the circumstances both preceding and
attending the entry of the Default Judgments and the plaintiffs' own problems
in relation
to those judgments.  In the relevant circumstances of each case, I
am satisfied that justice would be best served between the parties
if the Court
set aside the Default Judgments.  Accordingly, I am of the view that the
relevant onus has been discharged.
<P>

25	In each proceedings, the Default Judgment is set aside.  The plaintiff has
not indicated any desire to amend its process.  The
defendant has indicated
that it may wish to agitate the question of disallowance of the amendments made
to the 1990 process.  Any
such application should be brought within 7 days.
Otherwise, the Defences are to be filed within 14 days.  The costs of the
Applications
are to be costs in the cause.  The exhibits may be returned.
