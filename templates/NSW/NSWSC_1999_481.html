<i>Tuesday, 18 May 1999</i>
<P>

<b>4572/94	CAROLYN ROCHELLE KINSELA   -v-   PUBLIC TRUSTEE OF NEW SOUTH
WALES</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:</b> These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Provision Act </i>1982</a>.  By summons filed on 22 November 1994, the plaintiff,
Carolyn Rochelle Kinsela, seeks an order for provision for her maintenance,
education and advancement in life out of the estate of her late father Charles
Gordon Alexander Hill (to whom I shall refer as "the
deceased").  The deceased
died intestate on 16 August 1987. Letters of administration of his intestate
estate were, on 10 May 1993,
granted to the Public Trustee.  
<P>

2   	The deceased had been married twice.  Of his first
marriage, to Gwendolyn Ivy Hill, were born two children: the plaintiff (who
was
born on 20 April 1994 and who is presently aged fifty-five years) and Edward
Charles (who was born some two years earlier).
<P>

3   	The deceased subsequently separated from his first wife and
they were later divorced.  Their separation occurred in 1947. 
In 1949 the
deceased married Gwendolyn Mary Veronica Hill, to whom he was still married at
the date of his death.  There were born
to the deceased and Gwendolyn Mary
Veronica Hill seven children.  I have been informed, although there is no
precise evidence in
this regard, that one of those children by the deceased's
second marriage, Cheryl Ann Hill (who was born in 1951), is now deceased.
 
<P>

4   	The deceased was aged seventy-four years at the time of his
death.  Some four months after the deceased died his widow, Mrs
Gwendolyn Mary
Veronica Hill, died on 30 December 1987.  She also died intestate.
<P>

5   	The only asset of any significance left by the deceased was
a house property situate at and known as 650 Henry Lawson Drive,
East Hills.
That house property had an estimated value of $200,000 at the time of the death
of the deceased.  As a consequence of
the intestacy of the deceased, the
principal beneficiary in his estate was his widow.  Her estate has now become
entitled to that
benefit, and upon her intestacy the entitlement of the widow
is to be divided among the seven children of he marriage (being the
second
marriage of the deceased), all of whom were living at the time of the death of
the deceased's widow.  It will be appreciated
that the plaintiff, as a daughter
of the deceased by his first wife, does not share in any interest upon the
intestacy of the second
wife of the deceased.
<P>

6   	The house property was subsequently sold by the defendant,
and in April 1995, when the affidavit of the administrator was filed,
the
defendant was holding an amount of $182,261.  However, at that stage the
defendant needed to retain a reserve in order to cover
capital gains tax and
income tax.  Subsequently, as I understand it, those amounts have been paid.
However, provision must be made
for the costs of the present proceedings and
for the costs of the administration by the defendant of the estate.
<P>

7   	The most recent affidavit in regard to the financial
position of the estate is that of David Mayo Webb, a legal officer in
the
employ of the defendant. In his affidavit of 14 May 1999, Mr Webb states that
all the assets in the estate have been realised,
and that as at 12 May 1999
there was held by the Public Trustee in his common fund an amount of $200,520
(consisting of capital of
$175,766 and interest of $24,754).  From that amount,
however, there should be deducted a total of $20,000, to meet the costs of
the
present proceedings and the administration costs of the defendant, to which I
have already referred.  Therefore, in round figures,
there would be available
for distribution an amount of $180,500. 
<P>

8   	It will further be appreciated that if the plaintiff is
successful in the present proceedings, she will be entitled to an order
that
her costs be paid out of the estate of the deceased.  Any such costs order in
favour of the plaintiff will further reduce the
amount available for
distribution upon intestacy amongst the other persons entitled to share in the
intestate estate of the deceased.
<P>

9   	A calculation has been performed on behalf of the defendant
concerning the amounts which those presently entitled upon intestacy
in the
estate of the deceased or upon intestacy in the estate of the deceased's widow
would receive.
<P>

10   	Upon the intestacy of the deceased each of his children,
including the plaintiff, would be entitled to an amount of about
$440; and in
consequence of the intestacy of the deceased's widow, each of the seven
children born to the deceased by his widow would
be entitled to receive about
$28,000.  However, I have been informed by Counsel for the defendant that after
allowance is made for
the costs of the defendant and after provision is made
for the payment of statutory interest upon the widow's share in the intestacy
there would remain nothing in the estate of the deceased to pass to the
plaintiff or directly to the other children of the deceased.
That is, the
plaintiff would not even receive the $440 which, upon a preliminary
calculation, would be her entitlement upon the intestacy
of her father.
<P>

11   	The plaintiff did not institute the present proceedings
within the period of eighteen months after the death of the deceased
prescribed
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>.  That limitation period
expired on 16 February 1989.  The present proceedings were instituted by
summons which was filed on 22 November
1994, that is, some five years and nine
months after the expiry of the limitation period.  Accordingly, the plaintiff
by her summons
sought an order for extension of time.  I shall in due course
return to that application for extension of time.
<P>

12   	The plaintiff, as a daughter of the deceased, is an
eligible person within paragraph (b) of the definition of that phrase
contained
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. As such, she has the
standing to bring the present proceedings.
<P>

13   	The evidence discloses that the plaintiff from the age of
about eight had no contact with her father; that is, from about
1952 until her
father died in 1987, (a period of some thirty-five years) there was no contact
between the plaintiff and the deceased.
 
<P>

14   	The plaintiff in her affidavit evidence offers an
explanation for that lack of contact.  Her explanation is that, in consequence
of the breakdown of the marriage of her parents, she was for some time with her
mother but later with her father; that she was subject,
whilst with her father
and her father's new wife, to physical and sexual abuse; that there were
proceedings in the Children's Court
at Albion Street and that she was put into
various boarding schools and boarding institutions.
<P>

15   	It will be appreciated that the truth and accuracy of
these matters relied upon by the plaintiff to justify her total lack
of contact
and lack of desire to have any contact with the deceased for the last
thirty-five years of her life are matters concerning
which essentially only two
people were in a position to have direct knowledge. They were the plaintiff
herself, who has given her
version, and the deceased who, by definition, is not
in a position to give his version.  The Court must, therefore, approach
allegations
of this nature with caution.  
<P>

16   	However, there has been no submission on the part of the
defendant that I should reject the evidence of the plaintiff concerning
her
allegations of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her father and of
physical abuse at the hands of her stepmother.   Further,
the plaintiff,
although cross-examined, was not asked any questions concerning these matters.

<P>

17   	The Court is entitled, therefore, to accept the evidence
given by the plaintiff concerning these allegations which she offers
as an
explanation for her lack of contact with the deceased from the time when she
was aged eight and was ultimately removed and
ultimately ceased to be in the
custody of her father.
<P>

18   	It must also be recognised, in looking to the nature of
the relationship between the plaintiff and the deceased, a non-existent
relationship for a period of thirty-five years, that the deceased himself is
not revealed by any evidence to have desired to have
any contact or
communication with the plaintiff.  This was not a one-sided situation where
only one of the parties did not wish to
have contact with the other.  It would
appear from the evidence that the deceased totally abdicated all financial and
parental responsibilities
in relation to the plaintiff after she left his
custody when she was aged eight.
<P>

19   	The plaintiff in bringing her present claim has, at the
hearing, represented herself.  The proceedings were originally instituted
by a
solicitor acting on behalf of the plaintiff.  However, on 12 February 1998 the
plaintiff terminated the authority of that solicitor
and since that time she
has represented herself in the proceedings and has conducted the hearing in
person on her own behalf.
<P>

20   	It cannot be emphasised too strongly that a plaintiff
making a claim under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a>, </i>seeking provision for her
maintenance out of the estate of a deceased person, bears a responsibility to
place before the Court as
fully and as frankly as possible all available
information concerning her financial and material circumstances.  In this case
the
plaintiff has failed to place before the Court to the degree which the
Court would require all available information concerning her
financial and
material circumstances.  I appreciate that the plaintiff has chosen to act for
the last fifteen months without the
benefit of legal representation, but that
does not absolve her from enabling the Court to determine whether she has
established a
financial situation which would entitle her to an order for
provision.  The Court, however, must do the best it can with the evidence
which
is placed before it.
<P>

21   	In her original affidavit (which was prepared when the
plaintiff had a solicitor acting for her) she gave some evidence, skimpy
though
it was, concerning her income.  At that time, in February 1996, the plaintiff
was conducting her own business, known as Capri
Interior Decor, and she was
also in part-time casual employment with Dulux, the paint company, for which
she was being paid $11.40
an hour and worked on an average of twenty-five hours
a week.  From her own business she was at that time receiving a net profit
of
$68 a week.  She did not place before the Court in that affidavit any evidence
concerning her outgoings. 
<P>

22   	The plaintiff at that stage and to the present time
resides in a house property owned by her, which is situate at and known
as 94
Queens Parade East, Newport.  That house property which, in February 1996, was
valued at about $300,000 and was subject to
a mortgage for $100,000, has a
present value of about $500,000 and is subject to a mortgage of $250,000.  The
plaintiff is presently
paying an amount of $1,563 a month in interest upon the
mortgage, which is for a fixed principal sum. She owns a motor vehicle, which
in February 1996 was worth about $10,000.  At that time she had about $3000 of
personal debts.
<P>

23   	Some evidence was given by the plaintiff under
cross-examination concerning extensions to her residence and inquiries which
she had made concerning the cost of a smaller property in the area in which she
presently resides.  She gave evidence that a smaller
property would cost about
$500,000.  Apparently the extensions by way of the construction of an
additional storey to her residence
were effected in order to enable her
daughter and her daughter's two children to reside with her, which they did for
some time, but
they are no longer living with her.  
<P>

24   	However, for the period of about six months whilst the
plaintiff's daughter and grandchildren were residing with her, the
plaintiff
was receiving $150 a week rent from them.  Occasionally the plaintiff now rents
out the upper storey of her residence for
bed and breakfast, but that would be
only for one or two nights a week and not every week.
<P>

25   	Not only in relation to the substantive claim of the
plaintiff for an order for provision out of the estate of her late father,
but
also in relation to the application by her for an extension of time in which to
institute proceedings, it is relevant for the
Court to look to what might be
described as the competing claims of the other persons who are entitled to
share in the intestacy
of the deceased.
<P>

26   	Those other persons are the brother of the full blood of
the plaintiff, Edward Hill, and the seven siblings of the half blood
of the
plaintiff.  There is evidence that three of those siblings of the half blood
suffered from some form of intellectual problem.
 I have already referred to
Cheryl Ann, who was born on 2 August 1951 and who is said now to be deceased.
She was intellectually
disabled.  Helen Susan, who was born on 25 December
1953, and Margaret Gay, born on 2 January 1955, are also suffering from
intellectual
disability and are in receipt of benefits or pensions as a result
of such intellectual disability.  They are living in what might
be described as
protected accommodation.
<P>

27   	Two of the other siblings of the half blood of the
plaintiff, Gary Charles, born on 10 September 1952, and John Henry, born
on 21
February 1962, are presently not able to be located.  However, at an earlier
stage there was obtained some information concerning
the latter of those
siblings, John Henry, who, it would appear, was suffering from chronic
schizophrenia.  The only one of the siblings
of the half blood concerning whom
there is any detailed information is Joanne Frances, born on 8 September 1956.
She appears to be
in modest financial and material circumstances.
<P>

28   	The defendant opposes the extension of the prescribed
period which the plaintiff seeks.  The defendant in that opposition
refers to
the various factors which, in <i>Warren v. McKnight </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1996/419.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] NSWSC 419</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2040%20NSWLR%20390" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 40 NSWLR 390</a>,
Hodgson CJ in Eq described as being capable of being relevant to the exercise
of the discretion to extend time for bringing an application
under the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>.
<P>

29   	The first of those factors is the sufficiency of the
explanation of delay in making the claim.  I have already observed that
the
claim was some five years and nine months out of time, the summons being filed
more than seven years after the death of the deceased.
 The evidence, however,
discloses that it was only as a result of a communication to her from the
Public Trustee in September 1993
that the plaintiff became aware of the death
of her father.  Until that time she was not aware of his death, which had
occurred almost
six years earlier.
<P>

30   	Subsection (2) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s16.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 16</a> of the Act gives to the Court
a discretion to extend the prescribed period, having regard to all the
circumstances of the case, but
subject to subsection (3) of that section.
Subsection (3) contains an express prohibition against such an extension of the
prescribed
period, "unless sufficient cause is shown for the application not
having been made within that period".
<P>

31   	The plaintiff submits that her total unawareness for the
period of eighteen months after the death of her father on 16 September
1987
constitutes sufficient cause for her not having made her present application
within that period of eighteen months.  I am in
agreement with that submission.
If the plaintiff was not aware that her father had died until after the
expiration of the prescribed
period, it seems to me that she could not have
instituted the proceedings within the prescribed period.  Accordingly, the
Court is
not precluded by the prohibition contained in subsection (3) from
exercising its discretion under subsection (2).
<P>

32   	The defendant submits that even after the expiration of
the prescribed period that there is no explanation for the delay of
some nine
months from the awareness of the plaintiff that her father had died as a result
of the communication from the Public Trustee
in September 1993 until the filing
of the summons on 22 October 1994, a period of some fifteen months.  
<P>

33   	The plaintiff, however, in her affidavit of 28 February
1996 states that, upon receiving that information from the Public
Trustee, she
passed it on to solicitors with instructions to act and advise, and that
subsequently she instructed the solicitors
who were presently acting for her at
that time.  It seems to me that although the material in that regard could have
been somewhat
amplified, there is an adequate explanation of the delay of some
fifteen months after the plaintiff became aware of her father's
death until she
made the present claim.
<P>

34   	The defendant also submits that as a result of the
institution of the present proceedings there is prejudice to the beneficiaries,
in that the persons entitled upon intestacy have been considerably delayed in
receiving their entitlement.  
<P>

35   	There has certainly been a considerable delay in the
present proceedings.   The Court file discloses that the summons was
returnable
before the Registrar on 8 December 1994. On that date the Registrar directed
that Practice Note 63 should apply to the
proceedings, and the matter was not
again listed until 18 December 1997, when it again came before the Registrar.
There has been
no adequate explanation on the part of the plaintiff as to that
very considerable delay of more than three years. But, by the same
token, if
the defendant had desired to do so he could at any stage in that period have
had the matter listed for the making of peremptory
orders requiring the
plaintiff to comply with Practice Note 63, or even, as a final resort, the
defendant could have made application
for dismissal of the proceedings for want
of prosecution.
<P>

36   	I am not satisfied that there is, in fact, prejudice for
which the plaintiff should be held responsible affecting the interests
of the
beneficiaries.  There is no suggestion made by the defendant that there has
been any unconscionable conduct by the plaintiff.
 The defendant, however,
submits that the strength of the plaintiff's case is not great and that,
therefore, it would, in effect,
be futile for the Court to extend time.  
<P>

37   	The strength of the plaintiff's case is of significance
not only in the application to extend time but also, of course, in
her
substantive claim.  I have already referred to the somewhat meagre evidence
placed before the Court by the plaintiff concerning
her financial and material
circumstances.  However, I have reached the ultimate conclusion that the
plaintiff has established an
entitlement to an order for provision out of the
estate of the deceased.
<P>

38   	The deceased totally abdicated the entirety of his
responsibilities for the plaintiff during her childhood.  He acted towards
her
in a way which justified her not choosing to have any contact with him from the
age of eight until his death.  He clearly did
not wish to have any contact with
the daughter of his first marriage.  He did not fulfil his financial and legal
responsibilities
to her during her childhood.  It seems to me that the
plaintiff has established an entitlement to receive a benefit out of his estate
greater than the notional entitlement upon intestacy, which might have given
her $440 but which, in consequence of the present proceedings
and the
administration expenses of the estate, will give her nothing. The question,
however, is what order for provision should be
made in her favour.
<P>

39   	The plaintiff has sought an amount which would enable her
to discharge the mortgage on her house property.  That amount, of
course, would
entirely exhaust the totality of the assets of the estate, and I can see no
justification, in any event, for the plaintiff
receiving such an order.  
<P>

40   	It seems to me that the plaintiff has established an
entitlement to an order for a modest legacy.  The size of that legacy,
however,
should be such as will not detrimentally affect the beneficiaries who could be
described as disable persons, who will indirectly,
through the intestacy of
their mother, benefit from the estate of the deceased.
<P>

41   	The conclusion which I have reached is that the plaintiff
should receive a legacy which will enable her to pay any present
debts and to
remove. To an extent, the uncertainties of her income as a person conducting
her own business in self-employment, such
legacy to be in the amount of $40,000
and that that legacy should be borne by that part of the estate which would
otherwise pass
to persons other than the disable beneficiaries.
<P>

42   	I propose to stand the matter down to enable Counsel for
the defendant to prepare short minutes to reflect that conclusion;
and the
short minutes should also make provision for the costs of the plaintiff on the
party and party basis and the costs of the
defendant on the indemnity basis to
be paid out of the estate of the deceased.
<P>

AT 2 PM
<P>

43   	(Mr Wilson handed up short minutes of order to the
Master.)
<P>

44   	<b>MASTER:</b>  I make orders as in short minutes of order
dated 18 May 1999, initialled by me and filed in Court this day.
<P>

45   	The exhibits may be returned.
