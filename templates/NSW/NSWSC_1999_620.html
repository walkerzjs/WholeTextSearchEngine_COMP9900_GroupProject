<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>  This is the trial pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A(1)</a>
of the <b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act 1974</a></i></b> (the Act) of the issue whether the
matters complained of (which in each case forms an annexure to the Statement of
Claim) are reasonably
capable of carrying the imputations pleaded by the
plaintiffs.  The defendants concede that if the material is reasonably capable
of bearing the imputations alleged (or any of them) such imputations are
reasonably capable of being defamatory of the relevant plaintiff.
<P>

2   	Each of the matters complained of relates in one way or
another either to the Orient Hotel in The Rocks, Sydney and the alleged
financial interest in that hotel of the plaintiff, Paul Frances Patrick Whelan,
who is and was at all material times the Minister
of Police, and who is the
plaintiff in each of the proceedings except no. 20503 of 1998, in which the
plaintiff is his wife; or to
his relationship to a travel agency, Perfect
Travel, allegedly managed and partly owned by his wife.
<P>

<b><u>Nos. 20499 of 1998 and 20503 of 1998</u></b>
<P>

3   	The matter complained of in these proceedings appeared in
the Sun-Herald of 13 December 1998 and related to allegations that
members of
Parliament had been lobbied to use Perfect Travel and that the Independent
Commission against Corruption (ICAC) had been
investigating irregularities in
claims for travel allowances by members.
<P>

4   	In 20499 of 1998 the imputations alleged are:
<P>

(a)	The Plaintiff acted against the public interest by influencing other
members of Parliament to use his wife's travel agency in
breach of normal
parliamentary guidelines.
<P>

(b)	The Plaintiff abused his position as Minister for Police by influencing
other members of Parliament to use his wife's travel
agency in breach of normal
parliamentary guidelines.
<P>

5   	Both imputations are based on the proposition that Mr
Whelan influenced other members of Parliament to use his wife's travel
agency
(in breach of normal parliamentary guidelines), one imputing that in doing so
he acted against the public interest, the other
that in doing so he abused his
position as Minister for Police.  The crucial issue in the present case
therefore is whether the publication
conveys the imputation that he influenced
other members of Parliament to use his wife's travel agency (in breach of
normal parliamentary
guidelines).
<P>

6   	The test for determining whether matter complained of is
reasonably capable of conveying the imputations alleged was recently
restated
by Hunt CJ at CL in <b><i>Amalgamated Television Services Pty Limited -v-
Marsden </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2043%20NSWLR%20158" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 43 NSWLR 158</a> at 165 as follows (omitting
references):-
<P>

"The ordinary reasonable meaning of the matter complained of may be either the
literal meaning of the published matter, or what
is implied by that matter, or
what is inferred from it.  In deciding whether any particular imputation is
capable of being conveyed,
the question is whether it is <i>reasonably</i> so
capable, and any strained or forced or utterly unreasonable interpretation must
be rejected.  The ordinary reasonable reader (or
listener or viewer) is a
person of fair average intelligence, who is neither perverse, nor morbid or
suspicious of mind, nor avid
for scandal.  That person does not live in an
ivory tower but can and does read between the lines in the light of that
person's general
knowledge and experience of worldly affairs.
<P>

The mode or manner of publication is a material matter in determining what
imputation is capable of being conveyed.  The reader
of a book, for example, is
assumed to read it with more care than he or she would read a newspaper.  The
more sensational the article
in a newspaper, the less likely is it that the
ordinary reasonable reader will have read it with the degree of analytical care
which
may otherwise have been given to a book, and the less the degree of
accuracy which would be expected by the reader.  The ordinary
reasonable reader
of such an article is understandably prone  to engage in a certain amount of
loose thinking.  There is a wide degree
of latitude given to the capacity of
the matter complained of to convey particular imputations where the words
published are imprecise,
ambiguous, loose, fanciful or unusual."
<P>

7   	On behalf of the defendant it was submitted that merely to
suggest that a person has been charged or is under investigation
will not
support an imputation of guilt, that the article expressly states that Mr
Whelan is <b><i>not</i></b> one of the 25 members of Parliament under
investigation by ICAC in relation to politicians' travel entitlements, and
there is no
suggestion in the article that he has done anything wrong.
<P>

8   	In particular, it was submitted that the publication does
not suggest that the plaintiff solicited business for the travel
agency because
of the reference to it resulting in gain "for a parliamentary colleague and his
family", and it was submitted that
this indicated that it was someone of whom
the plaintiff was a parliamentary colleague that was doing the soliciting of
business.
 But I consider that the reference to the MPs being "encouraged to
favour" the agency . . . . . "resulting in private gain for a
parliamentary
colleague and his family" is reasonably capable of being read by the ordinary
reasonable reader of fair average intelligence
as meaning that a private gain
resulted to a parliamentary colleague of those MPs who were encouraged to use
the agency, i.e. the
plaintiff and his family.  That is to say, the
"parliamentary colleague" referred to is capable of being understood as a
colleague
of the MPs using the agency rather than as a colleague of the MP(s)
doing the encouraging.  The ordinary reasonable reader who so
read the article
might then infer that the person doing the encouraging would be the person who,
with his family, would be receiving
the resultant benefit, that is the
plaintiff.
<P>

9   	Whilst it is correct that generally a report that someone
has been charged with an offence is not capable of bearing an imputation
that
he is guilty or probably guilty:  <b><i>Mirror Newspapers Ltd -v- Harrison
</i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/50.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 50</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20149%20CLR%20293" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 149 CLR 293</a> at 301, and whilst I see no reason why a similar
principle should not apply to a report that someone is being investigated by
ICAC,
and whilst it is expressly stated that the plaintiff is <b><i>not</i></b>
one of the MPs under investigation, paras 6 and 7, and 36 and 37 do more than
refer to an investigation, but state what ICAC has
said in a report, not about
the 25 MPs still being investigated, but about the travel agency, and its use
by parliamentarians who
had been "encouraged to favour it" in an "inappropriate
arrangement".
<P>

10   	These matters, together with the reference in the heading
to "Whelan agency", the reporting of the call by the Leader of the
Opposition
for the plaintiff to stand aside as Minister, and bearing in mind that the
ordinary reasonable reader of a weekend newspaper
may engage in a certain
amount of loose thinking, lead me to conclude that the material complained of
is reasonably capable of conveying
the imputations alleged in no. 20499 of
1998.
<P>

11   	In the case of Mrs Whelan (no. 20503/99) the imputations
alleged are as follows:
<P>

(a)	The Plaintiff used her position as boss of a travel agency to secure
private gain for her husband the Minister for Police in
breach of normal
parliamentary guidelines.
<P>

(b)	The Plaintiff, as boss of a travel agency, for personal gain participated
in conduct in breach of parliamentary guidelines in
respect of
parliamentarians' travel.
<P>

(c)	The Plaintiff, as boss of a travel agency, participated in conduct contrary
to the public interest in respect of parliamentarians'
travel.
<P>

(d)	The Plaintiff had so conducted herself as boss of a travel agency as to
afford reasonable grounds for an investigation by the
Independent Commission
Against Corruption concerning whether she had engaged in corrupt conduct.
<P>

12   	The plaintiff is clearly identified as the person running
the relevant travel agency and there is reference to the dealing
by MPs with
the travel agency being the subject of an investigation by ICAC.  Moreover,
para 4 describes the agency as being "at
the centre" of the inquiry.
<P>

13   	It was submitted that there was nothing in the matter
complained of suggesting that Mrs Whelan had done anything wrong, and
in
particular, no suggestion that she did any of the encouraging of members of
Parliament to use the agency.  This last proposition
is so, but the whole tone
of the article, the way it is set up, the reference to the use of the agency by
politicians as "inappropriate"
and "not in the public interest", although not
in a strict sense saying that the plaintiff has done any specific thing that is
wrong,
strongly suggests that she has been knowingly involved in wrong doing in
respect of the travel allowances by politicians using the
agency.  For these
reasons I consider the matter complained of is reasonably capable of bearing
imputations (a) (b) and (c).
<P>

14   	As to imputation (d), the imputation is defective as it
fails to specify the nature of the corrupt conduct alleged: <b><i>Drummoyne
Municipal Council -v- Australian Broadcasting Corporation </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2021%20NSWLR%20135" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 21
NSWLR 135</a> at 140, and accordingly it must be struck out in its present form,
but with leave to re-plead if desired.
<P>

<b><u>No. 20500 of 1998</u></b>
<P>

15   	The matter complained of in these proceedings appeared in
the Sun-Herald of 22 November 1998 and stated that Senior Constable
Oregan was
seriously injured in an affray outside the Orient Hotel on the evening of Anzac
Day, i.e. 25 April 1998 and that he had
previously (May 1997) testified about
the hotel's excellent record in controlling disorderly conduct and often
refusing service to
drunken persons.  It stated that the Magistrate described
Senior Constable Oregan giving evidence for the defence as "very much out
of
the ordinary" but also noted that the charges were eventually dismissed and
that the Constable's bashing took place 8 months later.
 Finally reference was
made to the fact that police and council safety experts had identified
"numerous fire safety problems" at
the hotel, that a meeting had been held
between City Council officers and the licensee, Mr Iverach, and his lawyers,
which was extremely
positive and that the hotel had agreed to rectify all
identified breaches as soon as possible.
<P>

16   	In this matter the imputations alleged are:
<P>

(a)	The Plaintiff abused his position as Minister for Police by arranging for a
senior police officer to give evidence to the Licensing
Court in favour of the
hotel business in which he was the major shareholder.
<P>

(b)	The Plaintiff as Minister for Police was party to a cover up by police of
licensing offences at a hotel in which he was the
major shareholder.
<P>

(c)	The Plaintiff abused his position as Minister for Police as a result of
which a police officer gave misleading evidence to the
Court about the conduct
of his hotel business.
<P>

17   	Not only is there no suggestion, either directly or
otherwise, that the plaintiff was involved in causing Senior Constable
Oregan
to give evidence, but the fact that the Magistrate had described his giving
evidence as "very much out of the ordinary" would
seem to be a reference to the
police giving evidence for the defence in a prosecution brought by other
police.  There is no suggestion
that the evidence he gave was false, let alone
that the plaintiff was a party to procuring or causing him to give false or
misleading
evidence, and the fact that the proceedings were dismissed suggests
that the Magistrate accepted Constable Oregan's evidence.  Of
course, the fact
that he was assaulted when trying to break up a brawl at the hotel some 8
months later is no basis for suggesting
that he did not believe his evidence to
be true at the time he gave it.  Similarly the report that breaches of the fire
safety regulations
have been discovered and that the licensee has agreed to
rectify them is incapable of suggesting any knowledge, impropriety or
interference
in the due processes by the plaintiff.  There is simply no basis
in the article for inferring any cover up by police of licensing
offences, or
any giving of misleading evidence by police officers, or any involvement by the
plaintiff, either by using his position
as Minister for Police or otherwise, in
any of the events referred to. 
<P>

18   	It follows that the material published is incapable of
bearing any of the imputations alleged, and the proceedings should
be
dismissed.
<P>

<b><u>No. 20501 of 1998</u></b>
<P>

19   	The matter complained of in these proceedings appeared in
the Sun-Herald a week after the article referred to in no. 20500
of 1998,
namely on 29 November 1998.  It was headed "Two police probes into Whelan
hotel" and reported that two police internal affairs
inquiries were being held
into why police apparently failed to give evidence in a formal court hearing
that allowed the Orient Hotel
to gain a 24-hour licence, and how officers from
The Rocks were able to provide evidence on behalf of the licensee against
charges
that he had served intoxicated persons.  It goes on to state that "top
officers" supported an urgent application to have the hotel's
trading hours
extended to enable the plaintiff's son to have a black-tie 21st birthday
celebration at a time when the hotel was waiting
approval to become a permanent
24-hour operation, that an official note of support was furnished by the Patrol
Commander of The Rocks,
and when no objections were received from the City
Council, the application was approved.  There followed a re-hash of what had
appeared
the previous week about Senior Sergeant Brazel and Senior Constable
Oregan giving evidence for the defence on the charges of serving
intoxicated
persons, it referred to the fact that subsequently, that is after the
plaintiff's son's 21st birthday party, the hotel
received a 24-hour licence,
but the police did not provide a submission in relation to the application, and
that a recent Bureau
of Crime Statistics and Research survey showed that a
disproportionate number of assaults in the area emanated from a few licensed
premises of which the Orient Hotel appeared to be the worst.  
<P>

20   	The imputations alleged are as follows:
<P>

(a)	The Plaintiff abused his position as Minister for Police resulting in
police giving his hotel preferential treatment in applications
before the
Licensing Court.
<P>

(b)	The Plaintiff had behaved in such a manner as to afford reasonable grounds
for an investigation by the Police Internal Affairs
Branch to determine whether
he had abused his position as Minister for Police resulting in police giving
his hotel preferential treatment
in applications before the Licensing Court.
<P>

(c)	The Plaintiff as Minister for Police interfered with the course of justice
so as to cause police evidence relating to an application
before the Licensing
Court to be suppressed.
<P>

(d)	The Plaintiff had behaved in such a manner as to afford reasonable grounds
for a police investigation to determine whether he
had interfered with the
course of justice so as to cause police evidence relating to an application
before the Licensing Court to
be suppressed.
<P>

(e)	The Plaintiff while Minister for Police condoned violence and other
unlawful activity at a hotel in which he was the major shareholder.
<P>

(f)	The Plaintiff was a party to the misuse of police powers to cover up
misconduct at a hotel in which he was the major shareholder.
<P>

21   	Once again the plaintiff's difficulty is that there is no
suggestion either that he is being investigated or that he has been
in any way
involved in securing preferential treatment for his hotel, that he caused
evidence to be suppressed, that he condoned
violence or other unlawful activity
at the hotel or misused his powers as Police Minister to cover up misconduct at
the hotel.  Notwithstanding
the reference in the heading to "Whelan hotel", it
is the police who are said to be under investigation, not the plaintiff.
<P>

22   	I was referred to <b><i>Jones -v- Skelton </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20NSWR%20485" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964]
NSWR 485</a> PC where it was pointed out that the ordinary and natural meaning of
words is not limited to their literal meaning, but includes
what  may be
implied or inferred or an indirect meaning which a reasonable reader, guided
not by any special, but only by general
knowledge and not fettered by any
strict legal rules of construction, would draw from the words; and it was
submitted that when looked
at in this way the words are capable of bearing the
imputations alleged.  In particular it was submitted that because the
"plaintiff's
hotel" received the benefit of the so called "preferential
treatment" and alleged suppression of police evidence, it was open to
a jury to
find the imputations alleged established.  But nowhere, by way of inference,
implication, irony or otherwise, is there
any suggestion that the plaintiff has
done anything directly or indirectly to bring about the events which have
allegedly happened.
 There is no suggestion that he requested, spoke to,
"leaned on" or otherwise caused the police to act as they did.  The plaintiff's
difficulty in framing the imputations alleged are demonstrated by their
vagueness eg, in (b) and (d) it is alleged that he "behaved
in such a manner"
without specifying what it is claimed he said or did, that is, the manner in
which he behaved is not specified;
and the reason for this lack of specificity
is, it seems to me, that there is nothing in the material which would justify
the allegation
of such imputations. 
<P>

23   	As to imputation (c), that the Minister caused police
evidence relating to an application before the Licensing Court to be
suppressed, there is no suggestion in the article that there was any relevant
evidence which could be given, let alone that it was
suppressed.  As to
imputation (d), similar considerations apply together with the fact that it was
the police not the Minister that
was said to be the subject of the
investigation.  Likewise imputations (e) and (f) bear no relationship to
anything contained or
suggested by the material published.  The fact that
violence or misconduct occurred at or outside the Orient Hotel provides no
suggestion
or implication that the plaintiff condoned it or did anything to
cover up such misconduct.  I am satisfied that in relation to these
proceedings
the material relied on is incapable of giving rise to any of the imputations
alleged and the proceedings should be dismissed.
<P>

<b><u>No. 20502 of 1998</u></b>
<P>

24   	These proceedings arise out of what appeared in the
Sun-Herald on 20 December 1998 which reported, inter alia, that the plaintiff
had conceded that his wife was part of Perfect Travel, described as "a firm
involved in an ICAC travel rorts enquiry", thus changing
his earlier claim that
she had nothing to do with its activities.
<P>

25   	The imputations alleged are:
<P>

(a)	The Plaintiff had lied when he claimed that his wife had no interest in
Perfect Travel.
<P>

(b)	The Plaintiff had lied when he claimed that his wife derived no benefit
from Perfect Travel.
<P>

(c)	The Plaintiff acted against the public interest by influencing other
members of Parliament to use his wife's agency in breach
of normal
parliamentary guidelines.
<P>

(d)	The Plaintiff abused his position as Minister for Police by influencing
other members of Parliament to use his wife's travel
agency in breach of normal
parliamentary guidelines.
<P>

(e)	The Plaintiff while Minister for Police was a party to a breach of
parliamentary guidelines by members of Parliament in order
to obtain private
gain for himself  and his family.
<P>

(f)	The Plaintiff has so conducted himself as to afford reasonable grounds for
suspicion by the Independent Commission Against Corruption
that he had engaged
in corrupt conduct.
<P>

26   	In my view the publication is clearly capable of carrying
the imputation that the plaintiff had lied (imputations (a) and
(b)).  For the
defendant it was submitted that the imputations lacked precision and it was not
clear when it was alleged that the
lie was told, whether in his original
statement or in the concession; but this in my view is a matter for
particulars.
<P>

27   	It was also submitted that nowhere in the publication is
there material to support the claim that Mrs Whelan had derived a
benefit from
Perfect Travel essential to prove the lie alleged in imputation (b); but it
would be open to a reasonably intelligent
reader to infer that from her
reported shareholding, notwithstanding the claim that the firm had never
declared a dividend.
<P>

28   	As to imputations (c), (d) and (e) these are alleged to
arise from that part of the material which contains a repetition of
the
material which gave rise to proceedings 20499 of 1998, and similar
considerations arise, whilst imputation (f) suffers from the
same defect as
imputation (d) in no. 20503/1999 in that it fails to identify the nature of the
corrupt conduct alleged.
<P>

<b><u>Conclusions</u></b>
<P>

29   	I am therefore satisfied that the matters complained of
are capable of giving rise to the imputations (a) and ( b) alleged
in 20499 of
1998 and imputations (a) to (c) in 20503/1998, but that imputation (d) in the
latter case should be struck out with leave
to re-plead if desired.  
<P>

30   	I am further satisfied that in 20500 of 1998 and 20501 of
1998 the matters complained of are not capable of carrying any of
the
imputations pleaded and there should be judgment for the defendants in each
case, whilst in 20502 of 1999, the matter is capable
of bearing imputations (a)
to (e) inclusive, but imputation (f) should be struck out with leave to
re-plead if desired.
<P>

31   	It follows that the only proceedings to survive are 20499,
20502 and 20503 of 1998.  These proceedings all involve the travel
agency and
matters related thereto, 20499 and 20503 of 1998 both arise out of the same
publication, the parties are husband and wife,
and they employ the same
solicitor, in 20502 the plaintiff is the same as in 20499, and all cases
involve a number of common issues
