<b>JUDGMENT  --  </b>ex tempore
<P>

<b>19 November 1999</b>
<P>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>

1   	In relation to an infant of seven months "GG" with acute
lymphoblastic leukaemia ("ALL") diagnosed on 2 November 1999, the
director
General of the Department of Community Services ("DOCS") seeks two orders.  The
first is an order allowing the Executive
Director of the New Children's
Hospital at Westmead ("the Hospital") to be authorised to render medical
treatment, including the
transfusion of blood or blood products and a
reinfusion of the child's own blood.  I will describe that as "order 1".
<P>

2   	The second is an order that the Defendants, parents of baby
"GG", comply with any reasonable direction given by the qualified
staff of the
Hospital as to treatment and attendance for treatment of "GG".  I shall
describe that as "order 2".
<P>

3   	The parents I shall describe collectively as "BB", and the
infant as "GG".  I do so to preserve the confidentiality of the
child's
situation, being satisfied that this is necessary for the child's welfare.  
<P>

4   	"BB" are members of the Jehovah's Witnesses.  Through their
legal representatives and by affidavit, they have made clear that
for deeply
held religious reasons and also as a matter of civil liberty, they would be
opposed to any form of blood transfusion or
reinfusion of the child's own
blood.  It has been made clear that this opposition extends particularly to
orders 1 and 2 in their
present form.  Without prejudice to that position, the
Defendants have indicated that a form of order 1 modified to make it more
precise and less onerous, being in the form appended to this judgment, would be
less objectionable though still opposed.  This is
particularly insofar as it
avoids any suggestion that authorisation is required for treatment not
involving blood transfusions, which
the parents fully support.  They oppose
order 2 because they see it as both unnecessary and as "stripping the parents
of any right
to have any input into the care of their child".
<P>

5   	As to order 2, I have particularly noted the parent's
devoted concern for their child and the fact that to date the parents
have
brought their child to a hospital when first there was concern about "GG's"
health.  They have fully co-operated in the treatment
regime, though making
absolutely clear their opposition to blood transfusions.  I have given
consideration to a modified form of
order 2 that ensures the parents are
consulted if available and which acknowledges that devoted concern.
Furthermore, the order would
come into operation only if there were a failure
to comply with any reasonable direction.  The Defendants' legal representatives
still oppose such an order, but agree it is less objectionable in that modified
form.
<P>

<b>SALIENT FACTS</b>
<P>

6   	Baby "GG" was born 19 April 1999.  On 2 November 1999 "GG"
was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ("ALL") and was
admitted to The
New Children's Hospital at Westmead.
<P>

7   	Tests conducted on 3 November 1999 indicated that the child
was at a "high risk of morbidity".
<P>

8   	On 3 November 1999 Dr Peter Shaw, indicated to the
Defendants that "GG" would need transfusions of blood and blood product
if she
was to be treated to the internationally recognised protocol for treatment of
infant ALL.
<P>

9   	The Defendants indicated that they would not give
permission for such transfusions.  The parents are Jehovah's Witnesses and
would not consent to the blood transfusions.
<P>

10   	On the morning of 4 November 1999 "GG" was in a critical
condition and Dr Shaw decided that a blood transfusion should be
performed.  It
was so performed.  It is not in dispute that s20A of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Care and
Protection) Act</i> 1987</a> authorised that medical treatment.  This is on the
basis of Dr Shaw's "opinion that it [was] necessary, as a matter of urgency, to
carry out the treatment on the child in order to save the child's life or to
prevent serious damage to the child's health".
<P>

11   	DOCS became involved on 5 November 1999.
<P>

12   	The Defendants have indicated to doctors treating their
daughter that they would prefer each situation where transfusion may
take place
to be judged separately and that their expressed wishes in relation to
transfusions only be overrode in emergency situations.
<P>

13   	The treatment protocol established for "GG" does not allow
for that kind of crisis management of her condition but rather
provides a
regime to avert such emergency situations where possible.
<P>

14   	Platelet (a blood component) transfusions are a necessary
part of the preventative medicine involved in the protocol.
<P>

15   	There is considerable risk, according to Dr Peter Shaw,
that without transfusions, a fatal haemorrhage may occur (e.g. in
the
brain).
<P>

16   	It is not in dispute that the alternative treatment held
out by the parents as available in Perth at the King Edward Memorial
and
Princess Margaret Hospital is essentially the same as that at the Hospital as
it is now carried out.  That is to say, as confirmed
by the principal treating
doctor, Dr Shaw, the regime in place at the New Children's Hospital specially
designed for baby "GG" is
a conservative one so far as blood transfusions are
concerned respecting the parents' concern in that regard, though placing the
welfare of the child as paramount.  In particular, the Hospital has adopted so
far as it can the supportive therapy which "BB" as
parents have put to the
hospital including the use of EPO (erythro poietin) and the potential use of an
as yet unlicensed product
interleukin 11 to encourage the natural generation of
platelets.  This is subject in the latter case to there being no undesirable
side-effects for "GG" including counteraction of the chemotherapy treatment.
It is fair to say that the parents "BB" acknowledge
with gratitude that the
Hospital has in that way shown sensitivity to their concerns.
<P>

17   	It is also not in contention that to transport "GG" to
Perth, certainly inside of the next month and possibly for some time
after,
would endanger "GG's" life or health and in any event would not be acceptable
to the Perth hospital.
<P>

<b>RESOLUTION OF THE ISSUES</b>
<P>

18   	It is well settled that this Court has a common law
jurisdiction as <i>parens patriae</i> to safeguard the welfare of children and
it is that jurisdiction which the present application invokes.  It extends to
authorising
medical treatment for an infant, even against the parents' wishes
(<i>Department of Health and Community Services v J.W.B. and S.M.B. ("Marian's
case")</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%2d2%29%20175%20CLR%20218" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991-2) 175 CLR 218</a> by way of exception to what is described as the
right to personal integrity.  But that jurisdiction is to be exercised "in the
best
interests of the child" <i>Dalton v Skuthorpe</i> (McLelland J, SCNSW, 27
November 1989, unreported).  The paramount concern is the best interests and
welfare of the child.  
<P>

19   	The Defendants in their comprehensive submissions for
which I express my indebtedness, have pointed out that authorisation
for a
medical procedure of the sort here contemplated of blood transfusions, requires
that the Court be firmly satisfied upon convincing
evidence that such procedure
is justified;  <i>Briginshaw v Briginshaw</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1938/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1938] HCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281938%29%2060%20CLR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1938) 60 CLR  336.</a>  The Court
should in exercising its judgment in the matter be conscious that the orders
sought override the conscientiously held
belief of the parents.  Nonetheless
the Court must place the welfare of the child as paramount.  
<P>

20   	It is clear from the evidence that unless the regime in
place permits blood transfusions, "GG's" chances of survival are seriously
impaired and her life placed in jeopardy;  this is even with the regime of
supportive therapy now in place.  This is because one
effect of the
chemotherapy on a child with "GG's" condition is the likelihood that it will
bring about a reduced haemoglobin and
platelet level.  There is an appreciable
risk of serious damage to the child's health if such intervention is not
permitted until
an emergency situation occurs, as Dr Shaw's evidence makes
clear, as I explain.
<P>

21   	For the Defendants it was said that s20A of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Care and Protection) Act</i> 1987</a> (NSW), already invoked on 4
November 1999 adequately safeguarded the situation.  This was because that Act
permits intervention by
way of blood transfusion where the medical practitioner
is of the opinion that it is necessary as a matter of urgency to carry out
the
treatment on the child in order to save the child's life or to prevent serious
damage to the child's health.
<P>

22   	However, the orders sought, for reasons elaborated by Dr
Shaw in his evidence before me, go further than this in seeking to
alleviate
appreciable risk of serious damage to the child's health.  According to Dr
Shaw, whose evidence I accept, to leave matters
to the point where intervention
was only possible under s20A ran firstly the risk that the intervention would
be too late.  Secondly,
it left the child at continuing risk of cranial
haemorrhage once platelets dropped to a low enough level, a condition that
could
occur without warning and with fatal consequences.  Essentially, what Dr
Shaw explains is that the regime is not just for life-saving
intervention but
to avoid the need for it by removing the life-threatening event before matters
reach that extremity.
<P>

23   	The Defendants in their comprehensive submissions relied
upon a number of authorities and in particular to the case of <i>Re Marion (No.
2)</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%2d4%29%2017%20FamLR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993-4) 17 FamLR 336</a>, where Nicholson CJ (at 351) discusses the factors
that may be relevant in deciding the best interests of the child, in cases
where
orders concerning a particular medical procedure are sought.  He sets out
these factors in terms conveniently summarised below:
<P>

(i)	the particular condition of the child which requires the procedure or
treatment;
<P>

(ii)	the nature of the procedure or treatment proposed;
<P>

(iii)	the reasons for which it is proposed that the procedure or treatment be
carried out;
<P>

(iv)	the alternative courses of treatment that are available in relation to
that condition;
<P>

(v)	the desirability of and effect of authorising the procedure or treatment
proposed rather than the available alternatives;
<P>

(vi)	the physical effects on the child and the psychological and social
implications for the child of:
<P>

(a)	authorising the proposed procedure or treatment
<P>

(b)	not authorising the proposed procedure or treatment
<P>

(vii)	the nature and degree of any risk to the child of:
<P>

(a)	authorising the proposed procedure or treatment
<P>

(b)	not authorising the proposed procedure or treatment
<P>

(viii)	the views (if any) expressed by:
<P>

(a)	the guardian(s) of the child;'
<P>

(b)	a person who is entitled to the custody of the child;
<P>

(c)	a person who is responsible for the daily care and control of the child;
<P>

(d)	the child;
<P>

to the proposed procedure or treatment and to any alternative procedure or
treatment."
<P>

24   	It should be noted however that that case involved
compulsory sterilisation of an intellectually disabled child rather than
the
kind of considerations that may dictate blood transfusion for a child whose
life is at risk without it.  While the factors to
be taken into account may not
be significantly different, the application of those factors is in the present
context affected by
the life-threatening consequences if no such medical
treatment were authorised.  It is in that context that I have considered those
factors, in particular taking into account the matters dealt with in para 29
below.  I conclude that none of these factors are such
as to persuade me
against modified orders of the kind I have foreshadowed, having reached the
necessary level of satisfaction as
to the best welfare of the child.
<P>

<b>CONCLUSIONS</b>
<P>

25   	It follows from what I have said that I am satisfied that
order 1 should be made, though in the qualified form that I have
earlier
indicated.
<P>

26   	As to order 2, I have given considerable thought to
whether it is justified in circumstances where the parents have to date
at all
times complied with the reasonable directions of the Hospital and whose
devotion is not in doubt.  They indeed initiated the
treatment that has led to
the present application, though perhaps without appreciating in the first
instance the likelihood of blood
transfusions.  The concern which I have if no
such order is made is that it may place the parents in an agonising dilemma,
particularly
at the stage the child may no longer be in hospital but receiving
treatment as an outpatient.  That dilemma could arise if the child
displayed
symptoms which led the parents to conclude, correctly, that a blood transfusion
was likely.  The parents through their
legal advisers have made clear their
deep convictions in such circumstances against a blood transfusion though they
have properly
acknowledged that they would respect such a Court order.
<P>

27   	Nor do I think that it is fair to DOCS, the Hospital, or
the parents, nor is it compatible with the paramount welfare of the
child, to
have no version at all of order 2, and instead place a burden on the first two
parties to seek such an order as and when
the occasion arises.  Apart from the
strain on those involved, the welfare of the child could be jeopardised by the
delay entailed
in seeking a further order.  However, I do agree with the
parents as to consultation.  I have so expressed it by referring to
consultation
with the parents "if available" having regard to the need to avoid
delay if this might put at risk the health of the child.
<P>

28   	In all the circumstances, I believe a modified form of
order as appended to this judgment is warranted, primarily for the
reasons I
have mentioned but also recognising that such an order may actually assist all
concerned in that difficult situation.
<P>

29   	I should conclude by noting the concerns that have been
put by the father in his affidavit of 19 November 1999 and repeated
and
developed in the Defendants' helpful written submissions.  These concerns
include matters going to the welfare of the child brought
up in a household of
adherents to the beliefs of the Jehovah's Witnesses though the father was
careful to emphasise, and I of course
accept, that the parents would love the
child no less if a blood transfusion were to have to take place.  These
concerns also include
civil liberties and the medical risks inherent in blood
transfusions.  I have carefully weighed those concerns but conclude that
the
paramount welfare of the child is best served by the orders that I have now to
make.  In modifying the orders sought by DOCS
I acknowledge that they were
properly concerned to do what they considered best in the circumstances.
<P>

<b>ORDERS</b>
<P>

30   	1.	That the Executive Director of the New Children's
Hospital at Westmead ("the Hospital") be authorised to carry out, by
<P>

(a)	any qualified member of the staff of the Hospital;  or

the following:
<P>

(i)	the transfusion of blood or blood products and the reinfusion of the

health.
<P>

2.	That in the event that the First and Second Defendants fail to comply with
any reasonable direction following consultation with
the Defendants if
available, given by any qualified member of the staff of the Hospital or any
qualified medical practitioner visiting
the Hospital from time to time as to

all times that
the First and Second Defendants have so complied) then it is
ordered that they do so comply, such order taking effect only in the
event of
such failure as aforesaid.
