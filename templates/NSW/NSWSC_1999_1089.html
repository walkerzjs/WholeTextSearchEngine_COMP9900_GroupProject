(See page 46 of the transcript.)
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>:	Mr Hale of Senior Counsel has raised, at
the close of evidence and at the close of the address to the jury by Mr
Campbell on behalf
of the plaintiffs, a question as to what issues the jury
need to determine under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act</i> 1974</a> (the Act) in the
context of this litigation.
<P>

2   	The document alleged to be defamatory refers to the first
plaintiff in terms but to the second plaintiff, if at all, inferentially.
 Mr
Hale SC submits that, at this stage of the proceedings, the jury, under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A</a> of
the Act must be satisfied to the appropriate standard of proof by the plaintiff
not only that the material complained of conveys
the imputation alleged and is
defamatory but that it is defamatory of the plaintiff.
<P>

3   	It is self-evident - and Mr Hale SC concedes - that, if the
imputations alleged are proved and defamatory, Cinevest is defamed
but the
question whether the second plaintiff Mr Scherl is defamed by that matter, he
submits, is one upon which there is uncertainty
but which the jury must be
satisfied about on the balance of probabilities before they can make findings
against the defendants,
in respect of the second plaintiff.  The imputations
which have been placed by agreement before the jury in respect of the second
plaintiff, allege in terms that he is defamed.
<P>

4   	Mr Campbell, however, submits that the only questions for
the jury at present are whether the substance of the imputation is
made out
regardless of the identification of the target, as it were, and whether that
imputation is defamatory, again regardless
of the target.  At first blush there
is much to commend this submission.  The sense of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A</a> of the Act is to obtain
the decision of the jury upon the meaning of the publication and the impact
which the words complained of
would reasonably have on the fair-minded member
of the public.  These questions are obviously appropriate for a jury to decide
and
in respect of which a Judge brings no special knowledge to bear.  However,
it may also be fairly said that whether an imputation
refers to a particular
unnamed individual is also a matter which the commonsense of the jury might be
thought peculiarly apt to determine.
 Here, as I understand the pleadings, the
second plaintiff also seeks to establish that his controlling connection with
the first
plaintiff is known to people in the film industry and in particular
to those to whom the newsletter and prospectus in question were
circulated - or
some of them.
<P>

5   	Even so, this is a question of fact and is intimately
although not inextricably related to the question of whether the document,
as a
matter of its ordinary meaning, refers to him.  The question, therefore, seems
to me to arise at two levels.  Looking at the
documents as they stand, is there
a reference to the second plaintiff?  Secondly, if the words are capable of
referring to the second
plaintiff in the minds of the particular persons to
whom it was published, is there material from which the jury could infer an
affirmative
answer?  Even if this is so, is it a matter which they should
attempt to answer in the course of determining the questions in terms
required
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A(3)</a> of the Act?
<P>

6   	The analysis of the task under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A</a> of the Act is not easy.
This is not an area of law of which I pretend to have any detailed experience
and I suspect that the Act
is part of an unstated culture which is not
altogether easy for the uninitiated to appreciate.  However, I have been much
assisted
by the submissions of counsel and I think that the matter has been
sufficiently argued for me to have formed a judgment on the question
in
issue.
<P>

7   	Whilst the simplicity of approach proposed by Mr Campbell
for the defendants has a great deal of charm, I think that it over-simplifies
the actual elements which a determination of the issues under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A</a> of the Act
requires.  Of course, where the defamatory imputation is aimed at a named
person, there is no problem but, beyond that,
where on its face the uninitiated
may not identify any individual - and, as this case shows, this can be a matter
of degree - it
is very difficult to draw a clear line between whether something
is defamatory regardless of the person to whom it is directed on
the one hand
and identification of the individual on the other.
<P>

8   	The form of the imputations in this case demonstrate
precisely this point.  They were clearly drafted in accordance with
conventional
approaches.  I was referred by Mr Hale SC to <i>Consolidated Trust
Co Limited v Brown</i> (1948) 49 SR 87 at page 88 where Chief Justice Sir
Frederick Jordan said:
<P>

"In order that one person may establish against another a civil cause of action
in libel, it is essential that he should prove:
<P>

(1)	that a statement or other representation has been made, otherwise than
orally, of a kind likely to lead ordinary decent folk
to think the less of the
person about whom it is made;
<P>

(2)	that it was about him that it was made;  and
<P>

(3)	that the other has published it to at least one third party (who is not the
husband or wife of the other)."
<P>

It did seem to me that this readily separated on the one hand the question of
defamatory content and on the other that of identifying
the individual about
whom the imputation was made and I was therefore initially of the view that it
is precisely this separation
of which <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A</a> of the Act was a reflection.
<P>

9   	However, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s7a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7A(4)</a> of the Act confines the Court to the
question of defences.  An allegation that the plaintiff is not the person
defamed by the publication
is not a defence in this sense.  It is a matter for
the plaintiff to establish that the plaintiff was the person of whom the
defamatory
imputation is made.
<P>

10   	The role of juries in fact-finding in litigation is an
important traditional role and I would be loath to interpret this legislation
as excluding the jury from determining matters which otherwise appear to be
appropriate for them to determine unless I was constrained
to do so by its
express provisions.
<P>

11   	I therefore consider that the question of identification
of the person to whom it is alleged the defamatory imputation refers
is part of
the function of the jury in its consideration of whether it is satisfied that
the matter complained of carries the alleged
imputation and, if so, whether it
is defamatory.  I propose to direct the jury accordingly in this trial.
<P>
