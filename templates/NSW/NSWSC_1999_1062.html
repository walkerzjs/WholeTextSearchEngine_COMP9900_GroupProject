FRIDAY 22 OCTOBER 1999
<P>

<b>3968/99 - PATRICK CLEARY &amp; 1 OR  V  AUSTRALIAN CO-OPERATIVE FOODS LTD
&amp; 16 ORS (NO.3)</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Ex tempore;  revised on 26 October 1999)</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  In my reasons for judgment delivered on 12 October
1999 (<i>Cleary v Australian Co-operative Foods (No 2)</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/991.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[1999] NSWSC 991)</a> I
addressed some separate questions for determination under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31</a> of the Rules of
the Supreme Court. The separate questions are set out in paragraph 11 of my
judgment. My answers to the separate
questions are in paragraph 124 of my
judgment.
<P>

2  	I decided that the procedure adopted by the Defendants in the 6
September Materials with respect to the change of postal votes
was not a lawful
procedure because it was not authorised by the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1992157/" class="autolink_findacts">Co-operatives Act 1992</a>
(`the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1992157/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>'), the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/cr1997248/" class="autolink_findacts">Co-operatives Regulation 1997</a> (`the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/cr1997248/" class="autolink_findacts">Regulation</a>') or the Rules
of the first defendant (`the Rules').  I also decided that the first defendant
(`Dairy Farmers') and the second defendant
(`the directors of Dairy Farmers')
had, by sending the 6 September Materials to the members and MCU holders of
Dairy Farmers, engaged
in conduct that was misleading or deceptive or likely to
mislead or deceive in contravention of s 12DA of the<b> </b>Australian
Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989 (Cth) (`ASIC Act)', s 995 of
the<b> </b>Corporations Law and s 42 of the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act 1987</a> (NSW).
I adjourned the proceeding to enable the parties to make submissions with
respect to relief having regard to my reasons for
judgment.
<P>

3  	Counsel for the plaintiff has drawn my attention to an
inadvertent error in paragraph 100 of my reasons for judgment of 12 October
1999.  I wish to clarify the matter before making any orders which would give
effect to those reasons for judgment.  I was dealing
in that paragraph with the
plaintiffs' contention that the 6 September Materials were misleading in
describing the Parmalat Proposal
as `highly conditional'.  In paragraph 100 I
summarised the plaintiffs' written submissions on that point, as contained in
paragraph
55 of the submission document headed `The Conduct Issue'.  The
submission says:
<P>

`In circumstances where Mr Bryant stated that the conditions precedent are
normal and not exceptional for a merger proposal, it
is misleading to use such
graphic language which suggests a level of uncertainty that is simply not
sustainable in light of the expert
evidence.'
<P>

4  	In fact I had ruled that the portion of the report annexed to Mr
Bryant's affidavit in which he gave that evidence was inadmissible
in the form
in which it was presented.  I granted leave to the plaintiffs to adduce oral
evidence from the witness in admissible
form, but the leave was not used.
Therefore, my mistake was to refer in paragraph 100 of my reasons to an opinion
by Mr Bryant which
was not, in fact, in evidence.
<P>

5  	I am satisfied that my mistake had no effect on my reasoning and
conclusion.  I referred to Mr Bryant's opinion in the course
of and solely for
the purpose of summarising the plaintiffs' submission.  My reasoning concerning
the submission is in paragraph
101 of the judgment.  I relied on construction
of the 6 September Materials in light of the Parmalat Proposal and evidence of
Mr
Jephcott.  The evidence of Mr Bryant in the unadmitted part of his report
formed no part of my reasoning.
<P>

<b>The submissions of the parties on relief</b>
<P>

6  	The further hearing on the question of relief took place
yesterday.  The plaintiffs submitted that in addition to making orders
answering the first two separate questions in the manner set out in my reasons
for judgment on 12 October I should make:
<P>

&#183;	the orders sought in pars 1, 2, 3 and 7 of the amended summons, namely,
orders avoiding or declaring invalid the whole of
the postal ballot,
restraining the defendants from counting the postal ballot or publishing the
result, and declaring the procedure
for change of votes was not a lawful
procedure;
<P>

&#183;	a declaration reflecting my answer that the first and second defendants
engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in sending
the 6 September Materials
to members and MCU holders;
<P>

&#183;	an order that the first and second defendants be restrained from
proceeding without leave of the Court with any business
at the `Court-ordered
meeting' (that is the meeting of MCU holders, which was the subject of my order
of  30 July 1999 in proceedings
2822/99) or any adjournment thereof, other than
the taking of such steps as are necessary to adjourn the meeting;
<P>

&#183;	orders that the first and second defendants pay the plaintiffs' costs
concerning the invalidity of the change of vote procedure,
and that the second
defendants pay the plaintiffs' costs with respect to the misleading conduct
issue.
<P>

The plaintiffs handed up draft orders to this effect.
<P>

7  	If these orders were to be made they would be final relief as to
part of the proceedings brought by the plaintiffs.  Final orders
are justified,
say the plaintiffs, because they give effect to my reasons for judgment.  The
Court's power to make final orders disposing
of part of proceedings after
answering separate questions is conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31</a> r 6.  The general principles
upon which the Court should move from answering separate questions to making
final orders have not been
contested before me.
<P>

8  	The Rules of Dairy Farmers have been amended since I handed down
my reasons for judgment by adoption of a rule which authorises
a new change of
vote procedure with provisions to protect the secrecy of the ballot.  The
Registrar has registered the amendment.
 In light of this, the defendants say
that the consequences of my findings can be overcome by their sending to
members and MCU holders
a correcting supplement to the Restructure Booklet,
enclosing a further opinion by the independent expert together with a tax
opinion
and correspondence with Parmalat.  They also wish to include a media
release about the financial results of Dairy Farmers.
<P>

9  	They have produced drafts of these documents which have been the
subject of submissions, and of comments by me.  As a result
of that process,
the defendants propose to revise the drafts with a view to those revised
documents being sent to members and MCU
holders.  
<P>

10  	The defendants say that Dairy Farmers will undertake to dispatch
these correcting materials and if it does, no other orders
are needed in these
proceedings except as to costs.
<P>

11  	They submit that as an alternative to an undertaking by Dairy
Farmers, the Court could make an order on the joint and several
application of
the defendants directing Dairy Farmers to dispatch the correcting materials.
The Court's power to make such an order
may be found, they say, in s 1324 of
the Corporations Law and in the injunction provision of other legislation
modelled on s 80 of
the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act 1974</a>, namely, s 12GD of<b>
</b>ASIC Act and s 65 of the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a>. They also say that a
source of power is the Court's inherent power as confirmed and reinforced by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
23</a> of the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a> (NSW).
<P>

<b>Declaratory orders</b>
<P>

12  	It cannot be denied that the plaintiffs are entitled to some
orders in consequence of my reasons for judgment of 12 October
1999, even if
the defendants are right that corrective materials can be dispatched.  I see no
reason why I should not make orders
answering the first two separate questions
in the manner set out in my reasons for judgment of 12 October.  Similarly, I
see no reason
why I should not make a declaration reflecting my answer that the
first and second defendants engaged in misleading or  deceptive
conduct in
sending out the 6 September Materials.
<P>

<b>Issues as to the form of relief</b>
<P>

13  	The other relief sought by the plaintiffs and the relief sought
by the defendants raise issues of more difficulty.  It seems
to me that four
issues arise, namely,
<P>

(a)	whether I should make declaratory or injunctive orders as to the validity
of all or any of the postal votes which have been
cast;
<P>

(b)	whether I should enjoin the defendants from proceeding with the
Court-ordered meeting;
<P>

(c)	whether I should take any steps (and if so, what steps) to allow corrective
materials to be dispatched;
<P>

(d)	costs, including the costs sought against the directors personally.
<P>

14  	As to issue (a), the focus of submissions has naturally been on
the postal ballot, but I propose to deal with the effect of
misleading conduct
on proxies for the meetings as well.  I should note that there are, in fact,
two meetings in question.  The first
is the Court-ordered meeting of MCU
holders to consider the scheme which affects them.  The second is the meeting
of members convened
for the purpose of dealing with some matters ancillary to
the Restructure Proposal including amendments to the Rules.
<P>

15  	As to issue (b), it is appropriate to consider the meeting of
members to make those ancillary decisions as well as the Court-ordered
meeting
of MCU holders.
<P>

<b>Four categories of votes and proxies</b>
<P>

16  	For the purpose of considering this issue I propose to subdivide
postal votes which have been cast into four categories and
proxies which have
been lodged into three categories.  For the sake of simplicity I shall refer to
members alone, rather than members
and MCU holders, but what I say about
members' proxies applies with equal force to the proxies of MCU holders in
respect of their
meeting.
<P>

17  	The first category of postal vote, which is not a separate
category of proxies, is the category of replacement votes cast pursuant
to the
invalid change of vote procedure which was inaugurated by the 6 September
Materials.  The conclusion reached in my judgment
of 12 October 1999 entails
that those votes are invalid.  I need not say anything more about the first
category except to remark
that on the evidence, it appears that 21 replacement
votes have been received as at 20 October 1999.
<P>

18  	The second category applies to postal votes and proxies. It
comprises postal votes and proxies lodged after the Parmalat Proposal
was
delivered to Dairy Farmers on 31 August 1999, but before the dispatch of the 6
September Materials. There is no exact evidence
of the number of postal votes
in this category and the evidence with respect to proxies is out of date.  It
seems, however, that
1,305 postal votes were received by the returning officer
between 30 August and 6 September 1999.  Members in this category had not
been
informed of the Parmalat Proposal before lodging their votes or proxies, though
it existed when they did so.  They were, therefore,
not fully informed.
<P>

19  	In the third category, which affects proxies as well as postal
votes, are votes and proxies which used the materials sent to
members with the
Restructure Booklet early in August 1999, lodged with the returning officer
after dispatch of the 6 September Materials
(which included a media release
capable of immediate communication).  There is a substantial risk that the
members who lodged votes
or proxies in those circumstances had been misled at
the time when they did so.  Their decisions are, therefore, tainted by the
misleading
conduct of Dairy Farmers and its directors and they ought not to be
relied upon as an accurate expression of the will of those members.
 There were
1,189 postal votes in this category as at 20 October 1999 out of a total 4,027
postal votes cast by that date. Initially,
some 5,097 voting guides were issued
with the Restructure Booklet.
<P>

20  	The fourth category, applying to both proxies and postal votes,
comprises votes and proxies sent to the returning officer before
the Parmalat
Proposal was received by Dairy Farmers on 31 August 1999.  There are
approximately 1,533 postal votes in this category.
 My judgment of 12 October
was confined to the 6 September Materials and does not deal with whether
members were fully informed before
31 August.  The plaintiffs allege that they
were not.  That question is likely to involve substantial evidence as to the
course of
negotiations between Parmalat and Dairy Farmers before and after I
made my orders of 30 July 1999 in the scheme proceedings.
<P>

21  	The plaintiffs' allegations have not been heard, let alone
determined.  If one were to assume for present purposes that all
of the members
who voted or lodged proxies before 31 August 1999 were fully informed, the
question would be whether their decision
should be vitiated by the occurrence
of a material event after the votes were lodged, but before the results of the
ballot were declared.
 I propose to make that assumption for the purposes of
the present application for relief.
<P>

22  	The question is whether the Court has the power to make orders
with respect to the validity of the votes and proxies in each
category and if
it has the power, whether it ought to do so.  
<P>

<b>Validity of resolution of members</b>
<P>

23  	Typically, the question whether members of a corporation have
been fully and fairly informed arises in the context of a meeting
rather than a
postal vote (see the cases cited in <i>Ford's<b> </b>Principles of Corporations
Law</i> paragraph [7.460]).  If the members were misled or not fully informed
at the time when they voted at the meeting or appointed proxies
for it, the
appropriate remedy may be an order declaring invalid or setting aside the
resolution of the members:  <i>Pacific Coast Coal Mines Ltd v Arbuthnot
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1917%5d%20AC%20607" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1917] AC 607</a>;  <i>Hughes v Union Cold Storage Co Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281934%29%2078%20Sol%20Jo%20551" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1934) 78 Sol Jo
551.</a>  Alternatively, and perhaps more commonly, the Court may make an order
restraining the company from acting on the resolution or carrying
it into
effect:  eg, <i>Kaye v Croydon Tramways Company </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1898%5d%201%20Ch%20358" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1898] 1 Ch 358</a>;
<i>Tiessen v Henderson </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1899%5d%201%20Ch%20861" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1899] 1 Ch 861</a>;  <i>Baillie v Oriental Telephone
&amp; Electric Co Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1915%5d%201%20Ch%20503" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1915] 1 Ch 503.</a>  
<P>

24  	If the resolution has not been passed and a timely application
is made, an order may be made restraining the company from proceeding
with the
meeting - perhaps subject to leave, in order to permit the directors to seek
dissolution of the injunction if adequate corrective
disclosure has occurred.
An order of the latter kind was made by Gummow J in<b> </b><i>Fraser v NRMA Pty
Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1994/1397.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] FCA 1397</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2052%20FCR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 52 FCR 1</a>, 32.  Such orders do not deal directly with the
validity of proxies.  An order of the latter kind seem to leave open the
question
whether proxies lodged before the distribution of the corrective
material can remain in place for use at the eventual meeting.  If
distribution
of corrective material is a possibility, it may be necessary for the Court to
make a determination as to the validity
of proxies and votes which have already
been lodged, or the use to which they may be put.  
<P>

<b>Where an uninformed member grants a proxy</b>
<P>

25  	A proxy (more precisely an instrument of proxy as opposed to a
proxy holder) is essentially a grant of authority by A to B
to vote on A's
behalf at a meeting, either in the manner directed by A (`directed proxy') or
in B's discretion (`undirected proxy').
 Section 179 of the Act recognises
proxies of either kind.  The principal and agent relationship which the proxy
creates (see <i>Re Advance Bank Australia Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2022%20ACSR%20513" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 22 ACSR 513)</a> may be
created for value or without any contract.
<P>

26  	The problem with which I am presently concerned may be
characterised broadly as the question of validity of a conferral of
authority
by a principal upon an agent at a time when the principal is under a material
misapprehension not induced by the agent.
 In the present context, the
misapprehension implies that the vote which is subsequently cast by the agent
(the proxy holder) at
the meeting does not reflect the true will of the
principal (the member) and so it is open to the Court to invalidate the
resolution
which is adopted at the meeting, or to restrain the corporation from
acting in accordance with it.  The question of the validity
of the proxy itself
is normally not determined.
<P>

27  	The scope of the actual authority conferred by a principal upon
an agent is ascertained by applying ordinary principles of
construction,
including any proper implications from the express words used:  <i>Freeman
&amp; Lockyer v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%202%20QB%20480" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] 2 QB 480</a>, 502
per Diplock LJ;  see generally <i>Bowstead &amp; Reynolds on Agency</i> (16th
ed by F M B Reynolds, 1996), p 51 ff.  If a proxy is conferred at a time when
the member is under a material misapprehension
either because of misleading
disclosure by a third party or because of failure of the third party to make
disclosure of something
which it was the third party's duty to disclose, the
conferral of authority may be ineffective as a matter of construction. That
consequence may arise, in my opinion, even in cases where the misapprehension
or lack of information of a material matter is not
the product of any
misrepresentation or omission to disclose by the third party.  In such a case
the conferral of authority would
fail because it is subject to an implied
limitation, such that authority does not exist if the substratum upon which it
is based
is destroyed.  Consequently, it seems to me there is some ground for
concluding that in the second and third categories of case,
so far as they
relate to proxy votes, the conferral of the authority by the instrument of
proxy is invalid as between member and
proxy holder (although questions of
ostensible authority would arise if the position of third parties is
considered).
<P>

<b>Where an uninformed member casts a postal vote</b>
<P>

28  	There is an analogy between voting by proxy at a meeting and
voting by ballot without a meeting, whether the votes are cast
by post or in
person at a polling station.  In each case the voting process leads to the
declaration of the result of the ballot.
 In the case of a New South Wales
co-operative the result of the ballot is declared by the returning officer
signing a statement
under paragraph 8 of Schedule 2 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/cr1997248/" class="autolink_findacts">Regulation</a>.  The
decision of the members takes effect at that time.  Regardless of whether
particular postal votes are invalidated by a material
misapprehension which
existed when those votes were sent, the decision of the members upon the
declaration of the ballot may be vitiated
by informational deficiencies which
existed at the time the votes were sent.  If it is, the Court could declare the
resulting decision
to be invalid, or grant an injunction to restrain the
corporation from acting upon it.
<P>

29  	Beyond the prospect of invalidity of the declaration of the
result of the ballot is the question whether the votes, when sent,
should be
treated as individually invalid.  By analogy with the analysis presented above
concerning proxies, it appears to me that
if a vote is lodged at a time when
the voter is subject to informational deficiency either because of material
misrepresentation
by a third party or because of failure to disclose by a third
party who has a duty to disclose, or simply because a sufficiently
material
event has occurred of which the voter is not aware, the act of voting may be
vitiated by those circumstances.  It seems
to me that in the present case, in
view of the serious informational deficiency to which the voting process was
subject once the
Parmalat proposal was received on 31 August 1999, the postal
votes in the second and third categories as well as the instruments
of proxy
should be treated as invalid.
<P>

<b>Relief with respect to invalid proxies and postal votes</b>
<P>

30  	That leads to the question of the proposed form of  relief to be
granted with respect to votes and proxies in the second and
third categories.
The difficulty I have here is that an order of the Court purporting to
determine validity in these circumstances
would purport to bind parties who are
not before the Court, namely, the individual members and proxy holders.
<P>

31  	Section 12GM of the<b> </b>ASIC Act and s 72 of the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair
Trading Act</a> confer upon the Court the power to make a wide variety of orders in
certain circumstances.  The orders which may be made include
an order declaring
the whole or part of any contract to be void or even void <i>ab initio</i> (see
s 12GM(7)(a)).  However, assuming for the moment that the plaintiffs in this
case fit the category of plaintiffs for the purposes
of s 12GM, and that
proxies and postal votes can be treated as equivalent to contracts for this
purpose, the problem is that the
orders which the section authorises are all
orders with respect to conduct of a person who has engaged in the misleading
conduct
or who has been involved in the contravention.  Except in the case of
certain `collateral arrangements', s 12GM does not in its terms
authorise the
Court to make an order invalidating a contract affecting some third party who
has not been involved in any contravention.
<P>

32  	Section 1114 of the Corporations Law authorises the Court to
make an order declaring a contract to be void.  It has been held
that s 1114
can affect contracts, the parties to which are not parties in the proceedings
before the Court:  <i>NCSC v Monarch Petroleum NL </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1984/65.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] VicRp 65</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20VR%20733" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] VR 733</a>;
<i>Australian Securities Commission v Mount Burgess Gold Mining Co NL
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2062%20FCR%20389" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 62 FCR 389.</a>  However, no doubt as a safeguard in case this power is
misused, the relevant application must be made by the Australian Securities
and
Investments Commission, which is not an applicant before me.  
<P>

33  	It is appropriate to infer, therefore, that s 12GM is not
intended to permit the Court to make orders invalidating juridical
acts (other
than `collateral arrangements') by or in favour of parties who are not before
the Court:  see <i>Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v
International Technology Holdings Pty Ltd </i>(1997) ATPR paragraph 41-559;
<i>Krambousanos v Jedda Investments Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2064%20FCR%20348" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 64 FCR 348.</a>
<P>

34  	The difficulty may be overcome by giving effect to my view that
the votes and proxies are invalid, or at least are not to be
relied upon, by an
appropriate injunctive order.  In the case of postal votes the injunction would
restrain the third defendant from
declaring the result of, and the first and
third defendants from acting upon, the declaration of the result of the postal
ballot
if votes of the vitiated kind are counted.  In the case of proxies the
order would not be quite the order made by Gummow J in the
<i>NRMA </i> case,
but instead would be an order restraining the third defendant from declaring
the result of, and the company from acting upon
the declaration of the result
of, a poll on any resolution in which proxies of the vitiating kind are
used.
<P>

<b>Where the member acted before the occurrence of the material event</b>
<P>

35  	This brings me to the fourth category, which relates to votes
and proxies lodged before 31 August 1999 (the date when Dairy
Farmers received
the Parmalat Proposal).  On the basis of the analysis presented above, there is
no ground for saying that these
proxies and votes are invalid <i>per se</i>.
At the time when the members acted there was, upon the assumption which I have
made, adequate information available for that purpose.
 It is true that the
plaintiffs challenge that proposition in a part of the proceedings which has
not yet been heard.  If they succeed
then the fourth category may be merged
into the second and third for the purposes of analysis.  I am not in a position
to treat the
facts in that way for the time being. 
<P>

36  	Although, in my view, votes and proxies in the fourth category
are not invalid <i>per se</i> for the purposes of relief consequent upon my
determination of the separate questions, it appears to me appropriate to take
into
account the significance which would be attached to decisions produced by
the use of those votes and proxies.  
<P>

37  	The purpose of the postal vote is, in part, to obtain the
decision of the members under s 344 of the Act with respect to the
members'
scheme of arrangement which is part of the Restructure Proposal.  As I observed
in my reasons for judgment of 12 October
1999, the Court has a supervisory
jurisdiction with respect to schemes of arrangement.  That jurisdiction enables
the Court, for
example, to require a further process to be embarked upon, if at
the hearing to consider whether to approve the scheme, the Court
is not
satisfied that the true will of the persons affected by it has been ascertained
(see<b> </b><i>Re MB Group plc</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20BCLC%20672" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] BCLC 672</a>; and more generally <i>Re
Chevron (Sydney) Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1963/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1963] VicRp 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1963%5d%20VR%20249" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1963] VR 249</a>;  <i>Re Crusader Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2017%20ACSR%20336" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 17 ACSR
336).</a>  Having regard to the serious nature of the misleading conduct which I
have found to exist in this case, my view is that if the plaintiffs
in
proceedings 2882/99 were to rely, at the hearing to approve the members' scheme
under s 344, upon votes in the fourth category
I would not be satisfied that in
all the circumstances the true will of the members of Dairy Farmers had been
ascertained.  This
is because after those postal votes were lodged, a matter of
such material significance as the Parmalat Proposal has occurred which
has led
to substantial supplementary disclosure and may well lead to further corrective
disclosure.  In other words, my view would
be that I would expect to see
evidence of a voting process which had given the members a proper opportunity
to respond to the new
information.
<P>

38  	That leads to the question whether the Court's expectation would
be satisfied by members in the fourth category being given
the opportunity to
withdraw and replace their votes, or it would be necessary for new votes to be
cast.  The answer to that question
cannot finally be given until the Court has
the opportunity to review the information which is to be sent to the members as
a result
of the foreshadowed application in those proceedings, and the
arrangements for replacement of votes which may be offered.  As at
present
advised I doubt whether, given the seriously misleading conduct which has
occurred, I could be satisfied that the true will
of the members would be
ascertained by corrective disclosure and a replacement voting procedure without
an entirely fresh vote. 
<P>

<b>Conclusions as to votes and proxies</b>
<P>

39  	It follows that in my view:
<P>

(a)	postal votes in the first category are invalid;
<P>

(b)	it is likely that postal votes and proxies and in the second and third
categories are also invalid, but there are limitations
on the Court's powers
such that the appropriate orders to reflect that view are injunctions of the
kind which I have indicated;
<P>

(c)	proxies and postal votes in the fourth category are not invalid, but the
Court may not be confident that if they are taken into
account, the resulting
decisions would reflect the true will of the members and MCU holders for the
purpose of making orders under
s 344 of the Act.
<P>

<b>Injunction to restrain the holding of the meetings</b>
<P>

40  	The plaintiffs seek an injunction of the kind granted by Gummow
J in the<b> </b><i>NRMA</i><b> </b>case to restrain the defendants from
proceeding with the Court-ordered meeting without leave. Although the
application is apparently
confined to the Court-ordered meeting, it seems to me
the same principles will apply with respect to the meeting of members to
consider
ancillary matters.
<P>

41  	Since the plaintiffs have been successful with respect to the
separate questions, prima facie they are entitled to relief which
would reflect
their success.  If there were utility at this stage in an injunction to
restrain the defendants from proceeding with
any meeting without leave, the
application for that injunction would need to be seriously considered.  The
decision on that application
is, of course, discretionary.
<P>

42  	The defendants have foreshadowed that they wish to distribute
corrective material, and have submitted that relief of this kind
would
therefore be inappropriate. For reasons which I shall explain, it seems to me
that the application for directions for the distribution
of corrective material
should not be made in the present proceedings, but should be made in the scheme
proceeding, No. 2882/99. Nevertheless,
it is relevant to the application in the
present proceedings that the defendants have indicated their intention to
proceed with corrective
material, if the Court gives appropriate directions
and, indeed, a mature draft of corrective material was, as I have mentioned,
the subject of consideration at yesterday's hearing.
<P>

43  	In those circumstances, it seems to me that the Court should not
grant an injunction at this stage of the kind sought by the
plaintiff.  My view
is that there is no sufficient point in doing so, given the application which
the defendants wish to prosecute.
 Instead, the proper order in the present
proceedings is an order granting liberty to the plaintiffs to apply before me
to restore
that application for this injunction on 24 hours notice to the
defendants, on the basis that the application would obviously merit
serious
consideration if corrective material is not distributed pursuant to appropriate
directions of the Court in the near future.
<P>

<b>The distribution of corrective materials</b>
<P>

44  	At yesterday's hearing there was much debate with respect to a
draft of corrective materials which is intended in due course
to become an
exhibit in the appropriate proceedings.  The draft comprised a document
prepared by the first defendant, presumably
under the authority of its
directors, dealing with my reasons for judgment of 12 October 1999 and seeking
to make disclosure in response
to them.  That draft included instructions on
voting and set out the text of the new rules for postal ballots to which I have
referred.
 Attached to the draft was a report by Ernst &amp; Young Corporate
Finance Pty Limited as independent expert, dated 19 October 1999.
 In that
report Ernst &amp; Young concluded that should the retention of farmer control
of Dairy Farmers not be of paramount importance
to existing members and MCU
holders, then Ernst &amp; Young was of the opinion that the proposed
restructure would not be fair and
reasonable or in the best interests of
existing members and MCU holders.  Should the retention of farmer control be of
paramount
importance to existing members and MCU holders, then Ernst &amp;
Young was of the opinion that the Restructure Proposal would be
fair and
reasonable and in the best interests of members and MCU holders.
<P>

45  	Also attached to the corrective materials was a report by B D O
Nelson Parkhill, dated 18 October 1999, setting out the tax
consequences of the
Parmalat Proposal and commenting on the tax implications of some modifications
to it which might be needed in
the event that the Parmalat Proposal were to
proceed after the Restructure Proposal was implemented. Also attached were a
letter
from Parmalat to the directors of Dairy Farmers of 13 October 1999, a
reply by the Chairman of Dairy Farmers of 18 October 1999 and
a media release
dated 17 October 1999 headed `Dairy Farmers Announces Record Result'.  These
materials together comprise the corrective
materials which the defendants wish
to send to members and MCU holders.
<P>

46  	The immediate question is whether it is appropriate in the
present proceedings for the Court to make any order authorising
the dispatch of
the corrective materials and indeed, whether the Court has the power to do so.
As the plaintiffs pointed out, no
application has been made in the present
proceedings for any such order, although at yesterday's hearing the defendants'
counsel
handed up a draft cross-claim which would seek an order pursuant to s
1324 of the Corporations Law and any other enabling legislation
to the effect
that the first defendant dispatch such materials.
<P>

47  	The defendants contended that there were four sources of
authority for the Court to make such an order in the present proceedings.
 The
first source of authority is s 1324 of the<b> </b>Corporations Law.  The
defendants urged upon me `the wide view' of the section adopted in <i>BHP
Limited v Bell Resources Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%208%20ACLR%20689" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 8 ACLR 689</a> in contrast to `the
narrow view' adopted in<b> </b><i>Mesenberg v Cord Industrial Recruiters Pty
Limited</i><b> </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2039%20NSWLR%20128" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 39 NSWLR 128.</a>  Whatever view one takes as to the
scope of s 1324 it seems to me that that section is not an appropriate ground
for making the kind
of order which the foreshadowed application envisages.
Essentially, the order concerned would be a mandatory injunction made on the
application of parties including the party to be enjoined.  It would simply
provide a framework for the first defendant to do what
it wishes to do in order
to correct its own misleading conduct. If the section is otherwise available I
would not be disposed, in
the exercise of my discretion, to use it in that way
- even if one were to restrict the application to one made by the second or
third defendants alone, since the first defendant is obviously connected to
them.
<P>

48  	Secondly, the defendants seek to rely on s 12GD of the ASIC Act
and s 65 of the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/" class="autolink_findacts">Fair Trading Act</a>, which empower the Court to grant an
injunction on the application of named  parties and `any other person'.  The
defendants contend
that the words `any other person' must be given their
natural meaning and should not be so qualified as to be limited to consumers:
<i>R v Judges of the Federal Court of Australia, ex parte Pilkington ACI
Operations Pty Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1978/60.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1978] HCA 60</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%20142%20CLR%20113" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 142 CLR 113</a>, 131.  Again, it seems to me that
even if the section is literally available, as a matter of construction, to an
applicant which
wishes to secure an order against itself, or to the directors
or returning officer of that applicant for that purpose, such a use
would be
inappropriate on discretionary grounds in a case such as the present.  The
section permits civil enforcement of the statutory
provisions which it supports
<i>against</i>, rather than on the application of, those who contravene those
provisions.
<P>

49  	The defendants also contend that the Court has the power to make
an order of the kind sought because of the inherent jurisdiction,
confirmed by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/fta1987117/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23</a> of the<b> </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a>.  The scope of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23</a> has been the subject
of recent elucidation by the High Court of Australia:<b> </b><i>Cardile v LED
Builders Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281999%29%20162%20ALR%20294" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1999) 162 ALR 294.</a>  The Court should be wary of confining
its inherent jurisdiction in any artificial way.  Nonetheless if jurisdiction
exists under
either of these headings, it would be a surprising use of that
jurisdiction to make an order of the kind which the defendants propose.
 I
would not exercise the Court's discretion to do so.
<P>

50  	As an alternative to such an order, the defendants indicated
that they would offer an undertaking to the Court to dispatch
corrective
material.  The undertaking would be noted by the Court when it made orders in
these proceedings. While it seems it me
that such a procedure would be
possible, the Court needs to consider in a case of this kind what the
consequence of the undertaking
might be, when given in proceedings to which
only a small number of the potential counterparties to whom it would have
significance
have been joined as parties in the proceedings.
<P>

51  	It appears to me preferable for any obligation of Dairy Farmers
with respect to corrective materials to be undertaken in the
proceedings to
which the disclosure of information is primarily related, namely, the
proceedings constituted for the Court's approval
of the schemes of arrangement
involving members and MCU holders, No. 2882/99.  Because of the supervisory
jurisdiction to which I
have referred, the Court is able to give directions at
the second hearing for a further procedure to be undertaken to ascertain the
true will of the members and MCU holders.  In principle, it appears to me that
the same supervisory jurisdiction authorises the Court
to make appropriate
orders at an earlier time upon application.  For the reasons given in my
judgment of 12 October 1999 the directors
of a corporation which has embarked
upon a scheme of arrangement have an obligation to disclose to the members or
creditors affected
by the scheme any material new development occurring after
the dispatch of the explanatory statement and notice of meeting and before
the
scheme is approved.  I do not suggest that before doing so the directors are
obliged to make an application to the Court.  However
in a case such as the
present, where there is a substantial dispute already on foot, directors who
wish to discharge their obligation
to disclose material information may well
think it prudent to apply to the Court for directions.
<P>

52  	If an application to the Court for directions with respect to
the disclosure of supplementary information about a material
new event were to
be made, the Court would be able to deal with the application by virtue of its
supervisory jurisdiction.  It would
not be appropriate for the Court to confer
any imprimatur on the supplementary disclosure documents, just as no imprimatur
is conferred
on the scheme or the original explanatory statement when the Court
orders that a meeting be convened to consider the scheme:  <i>Re Sonodyne
International Ltd</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2015%20ACSR%20494" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 15 ACSR 494</a>, 497.  However, if directions with
respect to the dispatch of supplementary material were obtained, the directions
would have the
same general effect, in one respect, as the Court's orders have
when they are made at the first hearing in response to an application
for the
convening of the scheme meeting.  The Court ought not to give directions with
respect to the convening of the scheme meeting
unless the scheme is of such a
nature and is cast in such terms that, following approval at the meeting, the
Court would be likely
to approve it on an unopposed application:  <i>F T
Eastment &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v Metal Roof Decking Supplies Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%203%20ACLR%2069" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 3

</i>supra.
<P>

53  	Though these cases refer to the scheme itself, the principle of
the cases seems to me to be equally applicable to the explanatory
statement
which accompanies the scheme, since the statement is reviewed and (in the case
of company) approved by the Court.  Adapted
to the present circumstances, the
principle implies that the Court should not direct the dispatch of
supplementary disclosure materials
unless it is of the view that if those
materials are dispatched in a timely fashion and the scheme is approved at the
relevant meeting
or meetings, it would approve the scheme on an unopposed
application.
<P>

54  	There is therefore an available mechanism in proceedings No.
2882/99 for the defendants to raise the question of a corrective
disclosure
statement, and there are obvious problems in the defendants raising that
question in the present proceedings.  The appropriate
course, in my view, is
for me to proceed to make the orders which I have outlined without making a
broader injunctive order of the
kind made by Gummow J, on the basis that the
defendants have foreshadowed an application for directions as to the dispatch
of corrective
materials in proceedings No. 2882/99.  The present plaintiffs may
appear in those proceedings to resist the application, if they
choose to do
so.
<P>

55  	I intend to grant the plaintiffs liberty to apply to me on 24
hours' notice in the present proceeding, to restore their application
for such
an injunction, so that they can raise the issue again if insufficient progress
if made towards corrective disclosure.  The
defendants have stated through
their counsel that they will supply the revised draft corrective disclosure
materials to the plaintiffs
prior to their application to the Court.
<P>

<b>Costs</b>
<P>

56  	In the result the plaintiffs have been very substantially
successful with respect to the separate questions, and the application
for
final relief which they have made consequent upon my answers to the separate
questions.  Prima facie one would expect that costs
would follow those events.
However, there are some submissions by the plaintiffs and the defendants which
require further consideration.
<P>

57  	The plaintiffs submit that the first and second defendants
should pay their costs in relation to the first separate question
concerning
the validity of the change of the vote procedure.  They make no application for
costs against the third defendant.  
<P>

58  	With respect to the second separate question concerning
misleading and deceptive conduct, the plaintiffs contend that the directors
of
Dairy Farmers, the second defendants, should be ordered to pay the plaintiffs'
costs and no order in respect of that matter should
be made against the first
or third defendant.   The order against the directors alone is sought on the
basis that they were responsible
for authorising the misleading and deceptive
conduct which I have found to exist and that in the circumstances it is not
appropriate
for the burden of costs to be shared by them with the co-operative
of which the plaintiffs are members.  If Dairy Farmers were required
to pay or
share in the costs then to a degree the members of the Dairy Farmers including
the plaintiffs would suffer in consequence
of the misleading conduct which the
directors authorised.  The plaintiffs say this should not be allowed to
happen.
<P>

59  	The plaintiffs draw attention to the serious nature of the
misleading conduct in the present case.  I have already commented
on the nature
and seriousness of the first and second defendants' misleading conduct.  In my
reasons for judgment of 12 October 1999
I described the tone of the 6 September
Materials as `emotive, critical and negative', and I referred to them as
`combative and intemperate
rather than balanced and informative' (paragraph 7).

<P>

60  	The new report by Ernst &amp; Young seems to me to confirm what
was said in my reasons for judgment of 12 October about the
deficiencies in the
account of their opinion presented in the 6 September Materials.  The opinion
now expressed by Ernst &amp; Young
is noticeably different from their short
opinion which was included in the 6 September Materials.  I held that it was
misleading
for Dairy Farmers and its directors to include that short statement
in the 6 September Materials without the qualifications which
Ernst &amp; Young
placed upon it, concerning the limits of the work which Ernst &amp; Young had
done by way of evaluation and review,
and concerning the significance to Ernst
&amp; Young of their understanding of the importance of farmer control.  The
new opinion
of Ernst &amp; Young shows just how important their understanding
of the importance of farmer control was to their earlier expression
of opinion.
They now say that if farmer control does not have the paramount importance
which they previously understood it to have,
then the Restructure Proposal is
not fair and reasonable or in the best interests of members and MCU holders.
The difference between
the statement of Ernst &amp; Young in the 6 September
Materials and the opinion now expressed is so stark as to bring home the
gravity
of the misleading conduct on the earlier occasion.
<P>

61  	The plaintiffs say that the conduct of the management team
authorised by the directors before, during and after the hearing
of the
proceedings, and in particular, the conduct of Mr Langdon and Mr Tooth, brought
about the situation which forced them to take
these proceedings and that
conduct has persisted up to the point of judgment.  They submit that the
evidence establishes that Mr
Langdon, Mr Tooth and the management team engaged
in conduct which was inappropriate and high-handed in relation to the whole
subject
matter of the proceedings, and that Mr Langdon, Mr Tooth and the
management team have treated the Court's decision of 12 October
in a derisory
manner.  They asked me to infer that this conduct was authorised by the
directors.
<P>

62  	It appears to me that the plaintiffs submission has some
substance, though I believe it is an exaggeration to say that by their
conduct
Mr Langdon, Mr Tooth and the management team have since 12 October treated the
Court's decision in a `derisory manner'. 
I am concerned about the following
elements in the course of conduct of members of the management team, when their
cumulative effect
is considered:
<P>

&#183;	in the August edition of Farmer News Mr Langdon is quoted as saying `the
meetings left the directors and management in no
doubt that the farmer members
of the Dairy Farmers Group have not worked for generations over a period of 99
years to yield control
of a business that is poised for so much success in the
future';
<P>

&#183;	in his letter of 1 September 1999 to members Mr Langdon referred to the
Parmalat Proposal as `highly conditional', `both
unsolicited and unwelcome',
and `preying on farmers' uncertainty', and he advised members to `ignore any
Parmalat propaganda';
<P>

&#183;	in the press announcement of 31 August 1999 Mr Tooth is  quoted as
saying `the timing of the Parmalat Proposal is questionable
and it appears to
be designed to disrupt the Restructure Proposal', and the Parmalat Proposal is
`highly conditional' and `unsolicited
and unwelcome';
<P>

&#183;	the September edition of Farmer News creates an overall impression which
confirms the combative flavour of the 6 September
Materials;
<P>

&#183;	in a press release of 23 September 1999 Mr Langdon is quoted as saying,
`The Board believes that there is no foundation to
the allegations made by the
two dissident farmers and intends to vigorously defend its actions in
Court';
<P>

&#183;	in a letter to members of 23 September 1999 he refers to `any Parmalat
propaganda';
<P>

&#183;	in letters to various members of 24 September 1999 Mr Langdon states his
view that it is `unfortunate that others have incorrectly
assumed that those
signatories [to a requisition for a meeting] also represent support for the
costly and unnecessary litigation
that has now commenced'.
<P>

63  	The course of conduct reflected in these documents confirms the
findings which I made with respect to the 6 September Materials
in my judgment
of 12 October 1999.  It shows to my mind that senior officers of Dairy Farmers
including the Chairman Mr Langdon,
with the authority of the Board reflected in
the Board resolution of 3 September 1999, had embarked upon a campaign to
defeat the
prospects of the Parmalat Proposal being developed for consideration
by members prior to their vote on the restructure proposal,
and further a
campaign of isolating and criticising the plaintiffs for their initiation of
the proceedings which are before me now.
<P>

64  	In my opinion Mr Langdon ought to have realised, at least by the
time when the proceedings were instituted, that there were
some substantial
issues which needed to be considered.  His conduct suggests that either he did
not properly understand the basis
of the plaintiffs' case or else he acted in
deliberate disregard of his understanding for tactical purposes.
<P>

65  	A matter of particular concern to me is the way in which my
reasons for judgment of 12 October 1999 were described in a document
which was
distributed to field representatives and others shortly after my judgment was
handed down.  The document contains a summary
of my reasons for judgment which
makes no direct reference to my findings against the directors.  It identifies
only the particular
contents of the 6 September Materials which I found to be
misleading.  It is expressed in such a way that the reader would be likely
to
infer from it that the contravention of the law was merely technical.
<P>

66  	This evidence must be assessed in the light of the weighty duty
that directors of a corporation bear when they propose a restructure
scheme of
the kind which was proposed in this case.  The directors' duty to ensure that
before taking their decision, the members
who are affected by the proposed
scheme are fully and fairly informed of  all material matters, was underscored
by Gummow J and the
Full Federal Court in<b> </b><i>Fraser</i> <i>v NRMA
Holdings Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2055%20FCR%20452" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 55 FCR 452.</a>  Their duty is a central part of their
fiduciary obligation and is reinforced, in the way described by the Full
Federal Court (55
FCR at 465-467), by statutory consumer protection provisions
of great importance.  In the present case the directors' conduct in
authorising
the management team, including Mr Langdon, to act in the misleading and
combative way that they did fell far short of
what is required by legal
principles.
<P>

67  	It seems to me appropriate for the Court to take a view on the
question of costs which reflects the importance of those matters.
 I therefore
accept the submission by the plaintiffs that the order for costs in respect of
the separate question as to misleading
and deceptive conduct should be made
against the directors alone.
<P>

68  	The defendants submitted that my finding of misleading and
deceptive conduct was a finding of a breach of an objective statutory
standard.
That is true; but having regard to the matters to which I have referred, the
misleading conduct in the present case flows
from an authority given by the
board in circumstances where the board ought to have foreseen that their
authority would be used to
campaign rather than to inform.  Their conferral of
authority must be regarded as unwise, at least, and possibly worse.
<P>

69  	The defendants submitted that there was no allegation against
the directors or any of them that they acted dishonestly or in
bad faith.  I
should make it clear that my findings are not findings of dishonesty or bad
faith.  Nonetheless the findings which
I have made justify the orders which I
propose to make.
<P>

70  	Finally, the defendants submitted that the directors acted on
the advice of their legal and merchant banking advisers in preparing
the 6
September Materials.  The evidence indicates that advice was obtained and Mr
Langdon says that it was followed.
<P>

71  	The plaintiffs drew attention to a joint legal advice by
Addisons and Gilbert &amp; Tobin dated 2 September 1999, which stated
that the
supplementary materials should contain a comparison of the Parmalat Proposal to
the Restructure Proposal.  The 6 September
Materials do not contain a
comparison of the Parmalat Proposal with the Restructure Proposal, and the
plaintiffs say that Mr Langdon,
with the authority of the directors, overrode
or departed from the joint legal advice.  On the evidence before me I am not
able to
infer that in dispatching the 6 September Materials Mr Langdon overrode
or departed from legal advice.  It may be that the written
advice was expanded
and qualified by meetings which led to the production of the 6 September
Materials.  Be that as it may, Mr Langdon
and the directors who authorised the
dispatch of the 6 September Materials cannot avoid the consequences which ought
to follow with
respect to costs by saying that they relied upon the advice of
legal and merchant banking advisers.  The conduct which makes it appropriate
to
order the directors to pay costs is their authorising the preparation of
responses to the Parmalat Proposal which had a hostile
and emotive flavour,
antithetical to their duty to ensure that the members were fully and fairly
informed.  They are responsible
for the tone of the responses even if the
content may have been governed by advice.
<P>

72  	The defendants also drew attention to some aspects of the case
where the plaintiffs have not been successful.  In particular,
when the
plaintiffs gave written particulars of the alleged misleading conduct they
purported to rely on one matter referred to in
argument as `Particular 5', with
which they did not proceed at the hearing for determination of the separate
questions.  That is
true, but it is clear from counsel's submissions that
Particular 5 will be subject of further contention in the case at an
appropriate
time.  Particular 5 has not been abandoned and,  therefore, I
should not conclude that work done by the defendants in response to
Particular
5 has been wasted. The defendants also referred to the plaintiffs' failure with
respect to two aspects of their claim
to misleading conduct relating to the
`flawed valuation' and `lack of financial information' issues.  It is true the
plaintiffs failed
to succeed on those matters, but they are relatively minor
when measured against the degree of success which the plaintiffs have
had
generally.  There is no basis, in my view, for reducing the amount of costs to
which the plaintiffs would otherwise be entitled.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

73  	My conclusions, therefore, are that orders should be made with
respect to the validity of the voting and proxy process in the
manner which I
have indicated;  orders should be made reflecting the answers to the first two
separate questions;  a declaration
should be made with respect to the
misleading or deceptive conduct; the plaintiffs should be granted liberty to
apply to me on 24
hours' notice to reinstate their application for an
injunction of the kind ordered by Gummow J in the<b> </b><i>NRMA </i>case;  and
orders should be made that the first and second defendants should bear the
plaintiffs' costs with respect to determination
of the separate questions and
also the argument for relief concerning those questions, except that the second
defendants alone should
bear the plaintiffs' costs with respect to the
determination of separate question 1.2 concerning misleading conduct.
<P>

74  	I stand the proceedings over to Wednesday 27 October 1999 at
9.30am for the purpose of making the orders which I have outlined,
in
consequence of my determination of the separate questions. I direct the
plaintiffs to bring in short minutes for that purpose.
 I intend to stand the
proceedings over for mention before the Registrar, so that directions can be
given for the further progress
of the matter.
