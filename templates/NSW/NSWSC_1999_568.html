<P>

<b>DATE  10 JUNE 1999	</b>

<b>2043/1998  SPAUTZ v MORROW</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	This is an application brought by Michael Edward Spautz (Dr Spautz) by
Summons in which he seeks the following orders against
David Morrow, his former
solicitor;
<P>

	1.	Leave to seek the following orders:
<P>

	2.	That the defendant give to the plaintiff bills of costs in the proceedings
for wrongful dismissal and false imprisonment, for
1991 to the present;
<i>(Bills of Costs Proceedings)</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>3.	That the defendant give to the plaintiff all of the documents to
which the plaintiff is entitled in regard to the said proceedings
which are in
his and briefed barristers' possessions; <i>(Delivery up of Documents
Proceedings)</i>
<P>

	4.	That the plaintiff be granted leave to sue the defendant for alleged torts
committed by him as specified in the accompanying
affidavit; <i>(Alleged
Torts)</i>
<P>

	5.	Costs.
<P>

2	This matter was first listed before me on 30 April 1999 in the duty judge
list but was not reached and proceeded to hearing before
me on 3 May 1999 in
the duty list. Dr Spautz appeared in person and Mr Colefax, of counsel,
appeared for the defendant. The evidence
concluded on that day and final
submissions were being made when Mr Colefax applied for leave to call some
evidence in relation to
the delivery up of documents proceedings.  That leave
was granted and directions were given as to the filing and serving of that
evidence and any evidence in reply. An affidavit of Mr Morrow sworn on 3 May
1999 was filed and Dr Spautz filed an affidavit in reply.
<P>

3	The matter proceeded on 5 May when Mr Morrow was cross examined by Dr Spautz
and submissions concluded. I indicated that I would
deliver my judgment at 2 pm
on 6 May 1999.
<P>

4	On the morning of 6 May 1999 Dr Spautz made application to put further
submissions to me in respect of matters which had arisen
during the course of
the afternoon of 5 May 1999 to which I will refer later.  I granted that leave
and directed further submissions
be completed by 19 May 1999.
<P>

	<b>Necessity for leave</b>
<P>

5	The need for Dr Spautz to seek leave to initiate these proceedings arises
from the following orders made by McInerney J on 13
June 1990 pursuant to s84
of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a> (the Act)</i> in proceedings numbered 14464 of
1989 <i>Attorney-General in and for the State of New South Wales v Michael
Edward Spautz</i>;
<P>

	<i>1.	Until further order the defendant be restrained by himself or by his
servants or agents from;</i>
<P>

<i>	(i)	instituting any legal proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in any
Court in this State without the leave of this Court;</i>
<P>

<i>	(ii)	instituting any application in any legal proceedings, whether civil or
criminal, already instituted in any Court in this State
without the leave of
this Court;</i>
<P>

<i>	(iii)	instituting any appeal in respect of any legal proceedings, whether
civil or criminal, in any Court in this State without the
leave of this
Court.</i>
<P>

<i>	2	The defendant give not less than  (3) days' notice in writing to the
Crown Solicitor of any application for leave pursuant to the
foregoing
orders.</i>
<P>

6	When such an order is made<i> s 84(4)</i> of <i>the Act</i> provides that the
Court shall not give such a person leave to institute or continue any
proceedings unless the Court is satisfied
that the proceedings are not an abuse
of process and that there is prima facie ground for the proceedings.
<P>

	<b>The parties and their history</b>
<P>

7	The background to Dr Spautz's relationship with the University of Newcastle
and his dismissal therefrom and consequences flowing
from it including
subsequent litigation has been the subject of a number of judgments since
1980.
<P>

8	It is not necessary to set out in detail the background to that relationship
however some relevant parts of it are summarised
appropriately in the judgments
of McInerney J  in <i>Attorney-General v Spautz ( unreported 30 June 1990)
</i>and <i>Spautz v Williams (unreported 9 December 1993).</i>
<P>

9	Mr Morrow commenced acting as Dr Spautz' solicitor in about February 1991.
He was instructed to act for him in the matter of Spautz
v University of
Newcastle (3055 of 1980) (the wrongful dismissal proceedings) and subsequently
in relation to the matter of Spautz
v Dempsey, Butterworth and the State of New
South Wales (18905 of 1986)(the unlawful imprisonment proceedings). Mr Morrow
also acted
for Dr Spautz in the appeals in both cases and the application for
leave to appeal to the High Court.
<P>

10	Dr Spautz was unsuccessful in his litigation and it is apparent that Mr
Morrow's retainer was terminated although the date of
that termination is not
in evidence.
<P>

11	In the last twelve months Dr Spautz has written to Mr Morrow on numerous
occasions relating to matters pertaining to his wrongful
dismissal proceedings
and his false imprisonment proceedings.  In the course of those communications
Dr Spautz has requested from
Mr Morrow a number of documents within his various
files. He also requsted bills of costs in respect of the matters in which Mr
Morrow
was retained. 
<P>

12	Mr Morrow has provided copies of many, many documents to Dr Spautz during
the last two years.  However Dr Spautz has maintained
that a number of
documents have not been provided to him. The requests for the bills of costs
are dealt with later in this judgment.
<P>

	<b>Course of the evidence</b>
<P>

13	On 3 May 1999 Dr Spautz' affidavit was read and this was supplemented by
some documentary exhibits. Mr Morrow did not put on
any evidence. Final
submissions were then made.
<P>

14	Dr Spautz had prepared a list of some 35 documents to which he claimed
entitlement and which he claimed had not been delivered
to him. I was satisfied
that he had copies of all the documents to which he was entitled except for a
submission dated 9 December
1993 which became know in the proceedings before me
as document 29. This document allegedly contained some submissions in the
appeal
in the Court of Appeal in the wrongful dismissal case for which Dr
Spautz had been asking Mr Morrow for some time.
<P>

15	I raised with Mr Colefax the question as to whether Mr Morrow had in fact
delivered document 29 to Dr Spautz. Mr Colefax informed
me that his
instructions were that Mr Morrow did not have a copy of those submissions and
that his client could not produce what
he did not have. It was at this stage Mr
Colefax sought and was granted the leave to call some evidence in relation to
the documents
in Dr Spautz' list.
<P>

16	It has not been suggested at any stage in these proceedings that Dr Spautz
was not entitled to a copy of document 29. 
<P>

17	Mr Morrow swore an affidavit on 3 May 1999 in which he said that he did not
have document 29 in his possession. He also deposed
to the enquiries he had
made of both counsel briefed for Dr Spautz as to whether they held any
documents and stated that they had
advised him that they did not. Indeed his
evidence was that Dr Spautz had attended, junior counsel, Mr Cameron's chambers
in 1997
after the appeal and taken away all of the documents held by
counsel.
<P>

18	Dr Spautz maintained that he had not obtained nor received a copy of
document 29.
<P>

19	I allowed Dr Spautz to cross examine Mr Morrow on 5 May 1999 and his
evidence in relation to document 29 was as follows;
<P>

&#183;	He was aware that there was a document that counsel had prepared which
would answer the description of document 29;
<P>

&#183;	he believed document 29 had been sent to him by counsel and he reviewed
it and discussed it with counsel but did not know
where the document was at the
time he gave his evidence;
<P>

&#183;	he denied it was missing because he did not want Dr Spautz to see it and
said;
<P>

	<i>The probable explanation for its absence from my file is that it was
delivered to you earlier in 1997 when you attended my office
on four or five
occasions and took with you large plastic bags of many, many documents that I
didn't need any further.</i>
<P>

&#183;	he agreed that it was probably a year ago that Dr Spautz first asked him
to obtain documents from counsel but he was not
sure that document 29 was
specifically requested;
<P>

&#183;	Dr Spautz had informed him that a number of documents were very
important to him but he was not able to recall whether document
29 was
mentioned in this context;
<P>

&#183;	when shown a letter of 5 August 1998 from Dr Spautz to him which
referred specifically to document 29 he said;
<P>

	<i>I can see what is written in the letter, yes. I must say that I didn't read
the letter when I got it. Dr Spautz for the last 18 months
I suppose has been
delivering to me up to three times a week long letters alleging numerous things
and apart from glancing at them
briefly I have simply put them in a file and
ignored them, with some exception,  where I felt a response was required but I
paid
no further attention to them.</i>
<P>

&#183;	he was never conscious that Dr Spautz was specifically asking for
document 29;
<P>

&#183;	Mr Morrow denied the various suggestions made by Dr Spautz that he had
intentionally kept document 29 from him because he
knew it would help Dr Spautz
win his case against the Newcastle University and/or he knew that it would
provide Dr Spautz with ammunition
to sue him and counsel in the matter.
<P>

20	The evidence concluded and Dr Spautz made final submissions between the
morning and  luncheon adjournment. When the court reassembled
in the afternoon
Mr Colefax advised that after Mr Morrow had given his evidence he returned to
his office somewhat concerned about
Dr Spautz' interest in the missing
document. He advised that Mr Morrow had found a document at the bottom of a
pile in an obscure
part of his office.
<P>

21	It was apparent from the description given that this was a copy of document
29. Mr Colefax then sought leave to re-open the defendant's
case to tender the
document. In the circumstances I allowed Mr Colefax to re-open but on the basis
that Mr Morrow gave evidence of
the circumstances surrounding the location of
the document.
<P>

22	Mr Morrow gave the following evidence in chief;
<P>

<i>	I returned to my office this morning and because of the concern that Dr
Spautz had about some document that related to submissions
to the Court of
Appeal it occurred to me that I should look in the bundle of papers that were
separate from my files, in fact under
my computer. I did not expect to find
anything there but a number of copies of the University of Newcastle Act and By
Laws.</i>
<P>

<i>	In view of my evidence this morning I thought I ought to check that. I
found under these copies of the Act two documents, one of
which is the document
Mr Colefax mentioned.</i>
<P>

<i>	Might I say I apologise to the Court for inadvertently misleading the Court
this morning.</i>
<P>

23	The document was then tendered and Dr Spautz reserved his position to study
the document and compare it with his files and the
Registry file. On that basis
he did not object to the tender but submitted that it should not be seen as a
concession that he agreed
that it was the document he had been looking for.<i>
</i>The document became Exhibit 2.
<P>

24	Mr Morrow was cross examined upon the search he had made and it was
suggested to him that it was an <i>incredible </i>coincidence that he had found
the document on that day. Mr Morrow said that he did not expect to find the
document but he had made
the search because he had been so adamant in his
evidence that he did not have it.
<P>

25	Mr Morrow was asked why he did not send the document to Dr Spautz at the
time he received it. Mr Morrow was not sure when he
received Exhibit 2 but felt
it was in 1997 or later. He said that it had been the practice in Dr Spautz'
cases that he would receive
and discuss draft submissions with counsel before
they were finalised. He gave the following evidence;
<P>

<i>	In this case there was a decision taken, of which Dr Spautz was aware at
the time, to abandon some points of the appeal. It may be
I did not see draft
submissions in the case because things were changing fairly quickly at the
time.</i>
<P>

<i>	I believe I did not send you in 1993 a copy of any submissions.</i>
<P>

<i>	For two reasons. The submissions were prepared on the basis of instructions
you gave me that the appeal should proceed only on the
basis of Rath J's
decision. Your instructions having been received it seemed to me there would be
no point in spending the money
in sending a copy of the submissions to you. It
would not be my practice to send submissions of a technical nature to a
client.</i>
<P>

<i>	The second reason is at that time and for some months before December 1993
you were not particularly interested in the conduct of
this case, or any other
case for that matter. I am not quite sure why but whenever I would speak to you
about certain instructions
you would say if that is your advice go ahead and do
it.</i>
<P>

<i>	At that time and before the decision was made to abandon some points of
appeal, before I instructed counsel to abandon those points
I telephoned you
and told you what senior counsel had advised and what I thought your
instructions ought to be. You told me you were
happy because of the advice for
those points of appeal to be abandoned. Subsequently I wrote to you confirming
the advice.</i>
<P>

26	The evidence concluded on 5 May 1999 and submissions were finalised. The
matter was finally concluded by 19 May 1999 in the circumstances
to which I
have referred in paragraph 4 above.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Test to be applied</b>
<P>

27	Before any leave can be granted to Dr Spautz I have to be satisfied that the
proceedings for which he has applied for leave to
commence are not an abuse of
process and there is prima facie ground for them.
<P>

28	McInerney J considered the test to be applied and posed the question for
himself in relation to the prima facie ground as whether
or not <i>there is
some substance, on the face of it, in the allegations made. </i>He also
said:
<P>

	<i>This legislation may be considered to be draconian and its consequences for
a litigant are severe. Be that as it may, once the orders
are made under s84(1)
the plaintiff carries the onus of satisfying me this material is not an abuse
of process and that there is
prima facie ground for the proceedings.</i>
<P>

	<i>(Spautz v Williams &amp; Ors  p15-16)</i>
<P>

29	Leave was refused in that case on the basis that <i>it cannot be said he has
established these proceedings are not an abuse of process or have a prima facie
chance of success (p. 22).</i>
<P>

30	It is an abuse of process to commence proceedings which are doomed to
failure <i>(Charles Forte Investments Ltd v Amanda  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%201%20Ch%20240" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 1 Ch 240</a>;  Mann v
Goldstein (1968) 2 All ER 679 at 771;  Bryanston Finance Ltd v De Vries (No2)
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20Ch%2063" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) Ch  63</a> at 76-79)</i>.  Proceedings may be doomed to failure because no
reasonable cause of action is disclosed or, to use McInerney J's expression,
they
have no prima facie chance of success.
<P>

31	The requirement to establish the matters within <i>s84(4) of the Act</i>
allows the court to protect its own process against unwarranted usurpation of
its time and resources and to avoid the loss caused
to those who have to face
actions which lack any substance.<i>(Jones v Skyring <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2066%20ALJR%20810" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 66 ALJR 810</a> per
Toohey J) </i>
<P>

<b>	Bills of Costs proceedings</b>
<P>

32	Dr Spautz  claims that between 1997 and 1999 Mr Morrow was requested to
provide him with bills of costs in assessable form for
each of his cases. Dr
Spautz gave evidence that Mr Morrow had persistently ignored or refused his
request for the bills of costs.
<P>

33	On 24 March 1999 Dr Spautz wrote to Mr Morrow giving him what he described
as notice of intention to apply for assessment of
costs.
<P>

34	Dr Spautz relied upon what he described as statements of fact in respect of
the requests for the bills of costs.
<P>

	<i>He persistently refused to provide me with an itemised bill of costs until
induced to do so by the OLSC (Office of Legal Services
Commissioner).</i>
<P>

<i>	When he finally produced it he failed to include all of the information
mandated by the Rules and Regulations pursuant to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/lpa179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession
Act</a>.</i>
<P>

<i>	He has unjustifiably ignored my repeated requests for a properly amended
bill or supplementary bill or supplementary statement.</i> 
<P>

35	Additionally he claimed that in the false imprisonment case:
<P>

	<i>He has unjustifiably ignored several requests for a copy of the draft bill
of costs that he prepared and made available to the Crown
Solicitor and/or a
final bill of costs which I need for purposes of negotiating with the Crown
Solicitor for recovery of costs.</i>
<P>

	<i>He has unjustifiably refused to continue the negotiation with the Crown
Solicitor for recovery of costs which he started in 1997.</i>
<P>

	<i>He unjustifiably insisted that I abandon my right to receive a itemised
bill of costs from the Crown Solicitor and barrister for each
of the
proceedings in the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal.</i>
<P>

	<i>He unjustifiably insisted that I abandon said right as a precondition for
resumption of the said negotiations.</i>
<P>

	<i>He unjustifiably persisted in said refusal when even after I obtained the
required bill of costs from the Crown Solicitor personally
(which was many
months after I first requested it and only after intervention by the
OLSC).</i>
<P>

	<i>He has unjustifiably ignored several requests for an itemised bill of costs
for his (incomplete) work including the said partial negotiation
in 1997.  He
unjustifiably paid himself for said work out of the trust account knowing that
I did not approve of it.</i>
<P>

36	Mr Colefax who appeared for Mr Morrow submitted that the Court would not be
satisfied that there was prima facie ground for these
proceedings. He submits
that Dr Spautz vacillates between claims that Mr Morrow has refused to provide
a bill of costs yet states
that he has received a bill of costs after
intervention by the OLSC. Mr Colefax submits that the onus is firmly on Dr
Spautz and
that he has not discharged that onus.
<P>

37	Dr Spautz approach to this matter lacks precision.  However he submits that
he is entitled to a bill of costs in assessable form
because he claims that he
has been<i> overcharged.</i> There is no evidence before me as ot the amount
charged, the basis of the charge, when fees were rendered and/or paid or
whether
any, and if so, which aspects of the services provided by Mr Morrow
were covered by a grant of legal aid. There is some evidence
which suggests
that there was a grant of legal aid for a limited period. 
<P>

38	Mr Morrow provided some of his legal services without fee. This appears from
a letter in evidence from Mr Morrow to Dr Spautz
dated 15 April 1999 which
stated;
<P>

	<i>I note that you recently asked me to turn over to you my file relating to
the unsuccessful application to the High Court in the wrongful
dismissal case.
As that matter was undertaken by me and by counsel on the basis that no fee
would be charged unless that appeal succeeded,
and as no fees have in fact been
charged in the matter I regard the contents of the file as my property.</i>
<P>

<i>	</i>Mr Morrow went on to offer Dr Spautz photocopies of the file at his
expense.
<P>

39	There is also some evidence that Dr Spautz raised with Mr Morrow his
entitlement to transfer moneys from his trust account to
pay Mr Morrow's costs
and counsels' fees. This matter was raised in mid 1998 and Mr Morrow did
respond to Dr Spautz on this occasion
in the following terms:
<P>

	<i>In relation to your query about the payment of legal fees and disbursements
from my trust account I advise that the payment was made
pursuant to the
Authority and Charge dated 9 September 1991 and relevant provisions of the
Legal Profession Regulation.</i>
<P>

40	I am not aware of the period to which the bill or bills of costs which have
been produced to the Crown Solicitor's Office relate(s).
None of these bills
are in evidence.
<P>

41	Dr Spautz has made broad allegations which, as Mr Colefax submits, vacillate
from production to non-production in a most unsatisfactory
manner. Additionally
Dr Spautz claimed in paragraph 45 of Annexure A to his affidavit of 29 April
1999 that;
<P>

	<i>He has unjustifiably ignored several requests for a copy of the</i><cite>
draft </cite><i>bill of costs that he prepared and made available to the Crown
Solicitor;</i>
<P>

	Dr Spautz then claimed in paragraph 50 of Annexure A to the same affidavit;
<P>

	<i>He unjustifiably persisted in said refusal even after I obtained the
required bills of costs from the Crown Solicitor personally (which
was many
months after I first requested it and only after the intervention of the
OLSC)</i>
<P>

42	It appeared to me on this evidence that Dr Spautz had obtained the bill of
costs that Mr Morrrow had given to the Crown Solicitor.
However in submissions
on 5 May 1999 this topic was dealt with in the following way;
<P>

	<i>Her Honour;	You say that he gave it to the Crown and.. that you have asked
him for a copy and.. he unjustifiably refused to give you
a copy of the
document he gave to the Crown</i>
<P>

	<i>Dr Spautz;.	Made available, I didn't say gave, made it available in a
letter and they never took up his offer. Made available is not
the same thing
as giving.</i>
<P>

	I suppose on one view this may be technically correct but it was an
unimpressive submission in the light of paragraph 50 of the
annexure to Dr
Spautz' affidavit.
<P>

43	Even on his own evidence it is clear that Dr Spautz has some bills of cost.
It is not clear what the alleged problem may be with
those bills except in the
sense that Dr Spautz makes a very broad allegation that they are not detailed
enough for him. As I have
said I do not have those documents before me.
<P>

44	Dr Spautz also claims that he wishes to have bills of cost in all the
matters referred to in the proposed order for the last
7 years. Dr Spautz
apparently signed an authority in 1991 and apparently received accounts from Mr
Morrow in the matters other than
the matters to which the grants of legal aid
applied and the matter in which Mr Morrow acted without a fee. However once
again I
do not have any evidence before me setting out these matters.
<P>

45	In all the circumstances on the evidence before me I am not satisfied that
Dr Spautz has discharged his onus to satisfy me that
the bills of costs
proceedings are not an abuse. I am also not satisfied that there is prima facie
ground for the proceedings. I
therefore refuse leave to commence the bills of
costs proceedings.
<P>

	<b>The delivery up of documents</b>
<P>

46	Dr Spautz maintains that he is entitled to an order for the delivery of
certain documents which are contained in an annexure
to his affidavit sworn on
29 April 1999 in support of the application.
<P>

47	I am satisfied that Dr Spautz has all the documents on that list except for
the originals of the letters he sent to Mr Morrow
and the copies Mr Morrow
retains of the letters he sent to Dr Spautz. However I am satisfied that Dr
Spautz has copies of all those
documents.
<P>

48	The only document which it appeared Dr Spautz may not have had to which he
was entitled was document 29. I am satisfied that
he now has that document in
the form of the copy of Exhibit 2. This exhibit is identical to the document
that is in the Registry
file of the Court of Appeal matter to which both
parties have had access and which I have had copied and marked as exhibit 4.
<P>

49	In all these circumstances I am not satisfied that there is prima facie
ground for the proceedings and I am not satisfied that
the proceedings are not
an abuse. I therefore refuse leave to bring the delivery up of documents
proceedings.
<P>

	<b>Alleged Torts Proceedings</b>
<P>

50	Although Dr Spautz has filed a formal complaint against Mr Morrow in
relation to his professional conduct with the Office of
the Legal Services
Commissioner (OLSC) it must be made clear that I am dealing with Dr Spautz'
entitlement to leave to bring proceedings
in this court for what he claims are
<i>alleged torts.</i>
<P>

51	Although it is not clear Dr Spautz seems to put his case thus;
<P>

&#183;	He instructed Mr Morrow to appeal on a basis which included a ground
that the wrongful dismissal matter should be referred
back to Rolfe J as, it is
alleged, Rolfe J did not answer a number of questions which should have been
answered;
<P>

&#183;	Mr Morrow did not appeal on this ground but on others and this ground
was abandoned without Dr Spautz' authority and/or in
the face of express
instructions not to abandon it.
<P>

52	Mr Morrow gave evidence that he had discussed the abandonment of grounds of
appeal with Dr Spautz and that he had been given
instructions to proceed on
that basis. Indeed he gave evidence that at that time Dr Spautz had said that
if it was his advice he
should go ahead and do it. There is no issue between Dr
Spautz and Mr Morrow that Mr Morrow did tell him that the ground of appeal
was
doomed to fail or alternatively was futile.
<P>

53	In any event a question that arises is where does all this take Dr Spautz.
There is no evidence before me from which I could
infer that Mr Morrow's
conclusion about the particular ground of appeal was other than a sound
professional judgment at the time.

<P>

54	Dr Spautz made many broad allegations within the affidavit in support of his
application such as <i>He frequently gave me bad advice </i>and<i> He
frequently failed or refused to explain his advice or to quote the authorities
on which he was relying.</i>
<P>

55	Although there is material alleging that Mr Morrow has transferred money
from his trust account without authority there is no
particularity to the claim
as to when this may have occurred or in what amount or in which particular
case. Mr Morrow has referred
Dr Spautz to the authority he signed in 1991 in
his letter referred to in paragraph 39 above. That letter refers to a <i>query
about the payment.  </i>That query has now surfaced as an allegation.
<P>

56	I have taken into account the fact that Dr Spautz is not legally qualified
and that he is a litigant without legal representation.
I am conscious of the
view expressed in <i>Attorney General (Cth);Ex Parte Skyring (No 2)(1996)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=70%20ALJR%20985" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">70
ALJR 985</a> by Kirby J at 987 that;</i>
<P>

	<i>It is always necessary to keep open the possibility, particularly where a
person is not represented, that there might be, in the issues
which he or she
wishes to litigate, some question of substance hidden amongst all the
words.</i>
<P>

57	I have looked very carefully amongst all the words and I cannot discern from
them the essential features of any proper cause
of action.
<P>

58	Dr Spautz relied upon the circumstances to which I have referred earlier in
relation to Mr Morrow's location of document 29 as
evidence which would ground
a finding adverse to Mr Morrow on this application. There is no doubt that the
circumstances were somewhat
controversial in the light of the history of the
matter and the parties' history generally. However far from forming any adverse
view of Mr Morrow urged upon me by Dr Spautz I have formed the view that Mr
Morrow acted honestly in a situation which might reasonably
have been viewed as
exquisitely embarrassing for him.
<P>

59	The allegations made by Dr Spautz against Mr Morrow of perversion of the
course of justice and conspiracy to pervert the course
of justice have been
made without a scintilla of credible evidence.
<P>

60	I am not satisfied that this is not an abuse of process and I am not
satisfied that there is prima facie ground for the proceedings.
I therefore
refuse leave to commence the alleged torts proceedings.
<P>

	<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

61	I refuse leave to commence any of the proceedings in the Summons. The
Summons is dismissed. Having regard to the late discovery
of document 29 the
parties are to pay their own costs.
<P>
