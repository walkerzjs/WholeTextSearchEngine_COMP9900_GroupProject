<b>JUDGMENT  (MFI 6 - see T918 - waiver of privilege as to balance of
document)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  On 24 March I made a ruling in respect of the document then
marked for identification 6.  The conclusion to which
I came is set out in
paragraph 6 of that judgment, being  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1999/261.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">1999 NSWSC 261 (DLJT:27).</a>
<P>

2	Since making that ruling in relation to MFI 6, the cross-examination of Mr
Angus has been continued relevantly and acutely so,
in relation to the subject
matter of a communication/conversation between Mr Bates of the defendant's
solicitors and Mr Quayle and
"<i>the list of twelve names"</i>.  At page 875
line 46 of the transcript, during the course of cross-examination, a call was
made by Mr Barker for production of a
file note of Mr Bates outlining his
conversation with Mr Quayle on 5 February 1999, it having been acknowledged by
the witness that
such a note would exist.  In response to that call, MFI 6 has
been produced and the same argument has been advanced in relation to
privileged
material as to the balance of the document not hitherto disclosed.
<P>

3	To isolate line 46 at page 875 out of the context of the cross-examination
leading up to the call, specifically at pages 873 and
following, would render
the exercise in my mind artificial to the extreme.  The subject matter was Mr
Bates' communication with Mr
Quayle:  At 873 line 40 the question was asked of
the witness:
<P>

	<i>"Q.	Mr Bates comes along and says he has all these names from Mr Quayle;
the day Mr Quayle visited the police he showed you the list
and you don't know
what Mr Bates was going to do with it?</i>
<P>

	<i>A.	I know he was going to make follow-up inquiries to try and contact the
people.</i>
<P>

	<i>Q.	Why would he do that if he didn't know the significance of them?  They
might have been taken from the telephone book?</i>
<P>

	<i>A.	They may have been.</i>
<P>

	<i>Q.	Why was Mr Bates going to make follow-up inquiries?</i>
<P>

	<i>A.	To see whether they could assist us in the case".</i>
<P>

4	That testimony exposed more than the mere fact that there had been a
conversation between Mr Bates and Mr Quayle in relation to
the "<i>list of
twelve"</i>.
<P>

5	The subject matter of the follow-up enquiries in my view  cannot also be
detached from the evidence given by Mr Angus at 886 in
relation to the
retention by the defendant of a private investigator by the name of Sinclair in
respect of some questions in relation
to whom I ruled at page 888 line 40.
<P>

6	The cross-examination of Mr Angus hitherto has exposed subject matters
properly amenable to further cross-examination of the witness
in the area of
the hitherto exposed part of MFI 6 and adds a compelling reason to come to the
view that, first, notwithstanding the
witness' assertion to the contrary, any
privilege attending the balance has been waived, and/or second, for the
purposes of understanding
that exposed part of MFI 6 in the context of the now
revealed evidence of the witness, the balance of the document should be
revealed.
 The plaintiff will have access to it.
