<b>TUESDAY 30 MARCH 1999</b>
<P>

<b>3933/98 WATSON &amp; ORS v JAMES &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	This is effectively an application by the plaintiffs to strike out part of
the first and third to sixth defendants' defence and
the whole of the first and
third defendants' cross claim.
<P>

2	This matter was expedited and came before me for hearing on 15 and 16 March
1999.  The plaintiffs had filed a Statement of Claim
on the Friday before the
hearing and I was informed that it was then agreed that the defendants were to
do their best to file a defence
and any cross claim on the morning of the
hearing. The defendants were not in a position to file these documents until
the second
day of the hearing.
<P>

3	Mr White SC leading Mr Parker  appeared for the plaintiffs and Mr S Bell
appeared for the first and third to sixth defendants
(the defendants). The
hearing proceeded on 15 March with Mr White SC opening and calling some
evidence. 
<P>

4	On 16 March 1999 Mr Bell sought leave to file the defendants' defence and the
first and third defendants cross claim. Mr White
SC opposed that leave on the
basis  that paragraph 29 &amp; 30 of the defence and the whole of the cross
claim were embarrassing
and would be struck out for failing to disclose proper
defences and failing to disclose reasonable causes of action respectively.
<P>

	<b>Facts alleged</b>
<P>

5	In recent years in Australia there has developed a market for dealing in life
insurance policies.  When policy holders sell their
policies in this market
they are able to obtain a higher amount than would otherwise be available on
surrender of the policy to the
insurer.  This market has become known as the
Traded Policies Market.
<P>

6	The purchaser of the policy is able to alter it to generate a better yield at
the end of a three to five year period.  The apparent
reputation of the
investment is that the risk to capital is minimal and the yield is sufficient
to attract significant investor attention.
<P>

7	The Traded Policies Market attracted John Watson (Watson), the first
plaintiff, and Bernard John Kelly (Kelly), the second plaintiff,
who together
incorporated the entity PolicyLink Limited (PolicyLink).  The primary activity
of PolicyLink was to purchase policies,
alter them to generate an attractive
yield and sell them to investors including individuals and superannuation
funds.
<P>

8	PolicyLink operated in this manner throughout 1996 and 1997 selling its
purchased and altered policies to various entities including
the Australian
First Life Pooled Superannuation Trust (AFL PST) through its manager Auton
Consulting Pty Ltd (Auton).  
<P>

9	In mid 1997 the relationship between PolicyLink and Auton broke down.  As a
result of this breakdown Watson and Kelly approached
Brenton James (James), the
first defendant, to find a solution to the problem. 
<P>

10	Agreement was reached that in consideration of a payment of 1 per cent of
the retail value of traded policies to one of James'
companies, Trojan
Securities Pty Ltd (Trojan), it would broker traded policies to AFLPST and
would act on behalf of PolicyLink which
would be the undisclosed principal on
such sales.
<P>

11	In 1997 Watson developed a plan to expand the market by the establishment of
another pooled superannuation trust (PST) which
could purchase the traded
policies from PolicyLink using capital raised by issuing units in the PST to
investors.
<P>

12	Watson, Kelly and James had various discussions, which I understand will be
the subject of some contest, and on 21 August 1997
Dominion Funds Management
Ltd (DFM), the second defendant, was incorporated.  The directors of DFM at
this time were  Watson, Kelly
and James.
<P>

13	Shares in DFM were issued to each of Watson (1 share), Kelly (1 share) and
James (1 share) and companies controlled by them respectively,
the third
plaintiff Nostaw Pty Ltd (Nostaw) (32 shares), the fourth plaintiff Combined
Associated Promotions Pty Ltd (CAP) (32 shares)
and the third defendant
Sagacity Partners Limited BVI (Sagacity) (32 shares).
<P>

14	Watson and Kelly will claim they informed James that it was their desire to
keep their involvement in the day to day management
of DFM to a minimum.  To
that end it was their intention to resign as directors.  Messrs Richard
Liebmann (Liebmann) and Raymond
Willing (Willing) were nominated  to replace
Watson and Kelly.  
<P>

15	Watson, Kelly and James also agreed to  set up the Dominion Funds Management
Pooled Superannuation Trust (DFMPST) which was to
be managed by DFM.
Commercial Nominees Australia Ltd agreed to act as trustee and Permanent
Trustee Co Ltd agreed to act as custodian.
<P>

16	DFM was  to market the DFM PST to enable sufficient funds to be generated so
that PolicyLink could supply the traded policies
to DFMPST with an arrangement
for commission to be paid by PolicyLink to DFM.  
<P>

17	In November 1997 the arrangement between PolicyLink and Trojan in selling
policies to AFLPST was varied to replace Trojan with
DFM.  Trojan's commission
was thereby available to DFM.
<P>

18	At this time further shares in DFM were issued to facilitate the raising of
further capital.  Auckland  Trust Company Superannuation
Fund (Auckland) of
which Kelly and Watson claim to be members purchased 60 shares in DFM, 30 each
from Nostaw and CAP.  The other
shares were issued to  James, Kelly and
Watson's respective companies so that the shareholding was then James (1),
Sagacity BVI (132),
Watson (1), Nostaw (102), Kelly (1), CAP (102), Auckland
(60).
<P>

19	On 18 November 1997 Watson, Kelly and James held a directors' meeting of
DFM.  The terms of the discussions and agreements reached
 at this meeting will
be crucial to the outcome of this litigation.  Watson and Kelly claim that
agreement was reached that any issue
of options for the issue of a further 25
per cent of shares in DFM were to be held in trust by Kelly, Watson and James
on behalf
of the existing shareholders of the company and that their allocation
would occur only<b> </b><i>at the<b> </b>unanimous discretion of Kelly, Watson
and James</i>.
<P>

20	On the other hand James claims that it was agreed that such options could be
allocated <i>at the discretion and agreement of the directors.  </i>He will
claim that  "directors" means whoever the directors were at the time of the
allocation.
<P>

21	On 17 December 1997 Watson and Kelly retired as directors and Liebmann and
Willing were appointed to the Board of DFM.
<P>

22	In February 1998 Mr Andrew de Vries (de Vries), the fourth defendant, was
appointed as the marketing manager of DFM to assist
with the marketing of DFM
and the DFM PST.  
<P>

23	During the first half of 1998 the relationship between Watson, Kelly and
James soured.  So too it appears did the relationship
between James, Liebmann
and Willing which resulted in the resignation of Liebmann and Willing in late
June 1998.
<P>

24	It is apparent there was a meeting between at least Watson and Roger Auton
of Auton on 9 June 1998.  On 10 June 1998 Roger Auton
forwarded a facsimile to
Watson at PolicyLink which referred to the meeting of yesterday regarding the
<i>New Traded Policy PST and Dominion Funds Management Ltd<b>.</b>  </i>  Auton
suggested to Watson that the <i>proposed agreement be effective from
1.7.98.</i>
<P>

25	Auton stated that it would enter into an exclusive arrangement with
PolicyLink for the purchase of policies by AFLPST and that
AFLPST would trade
directly with PolicyLink.  Auton also advised that the current heads of
agreement between Commercial Nominees
and DFM were to be cancelled and replaced
by alternative arrangements which the defendants claim were less advantageous
to DFM and
the interests of the James and Sagacity. The evidence of the
defendants tendered by the plaintiff without objection on this application
is
that in any event James was informed by Kelly that Auton had been approached
and PolicyLink's problems of the previous year had
been sorted out. Further
that Auton would make contact with James to effectively obtain his approval of
the arrangements. (James
affidavit 6/11/98 - pars. 64 -67)
<P>

26	It is these arrangements that are the source of complaint by James and
Sagacity in the proposed cross claim.  I shall return
to this in more detail in
due course. 
<P>

27	After Liebmann and Willing resigned James purported to appoint two other
directors, his brother, Kenneth David James (K James),
the fifth defendant and
de Vries.
<P>

28	The events of July 1998 are the subject of the plaintiffs' claims and can be
summarised relevantly as follows:
<P>

	28.1	On or about 23 July 1998 K James and de Vries resolved at a director's
meeting of DFM that DFM enter a Management Services
Agreement with Dominion
Corporate Finance Pty Ltd (DCF) the sixth defendant, whereby DCF would provide
management services to DFM.
 DCF is a company controlled by James. (the
Management Agreement)
<P>

	28.2	At a director's meeting of DFM on 24 July 1998 (after the issue of 325
shares to each of Nostaw, CAP and Sagacity) James,
K James and de Vries,
without notice to the plaintiffs, resolved to issue and allot 457 ordinary
shares in DFM to Sagacity.  On the
same day such shares were issued and
allotted to Sagacity bringing James' shareholding to 915 shares compared to the
shareholding
of the Watson/Kelly interests of 916 shares. (the Sagacity Shares
Issue)
<P>

	28.3	On 29 July 1998 at a directors' meeting of DFM attended by James, K James
and de Vries, James tabled a document purporting
to be a minute of the
resolution passed at the meeting of 18 November 1997. This contained the
resolution for which James contends
and is contrary to the resolution for which
the plaintiffs contend. Once again without notice to the plaintiffs, the
directors then
resolved to issue and allot two ordinary fully paid shares in
DFM to James.  These were issued and allotted on that day and brought
James'
shareholding to 917 shares compared to the Watson/Kelly interests of 916
shares.  (the James' Shares Issue)
<P>

29	On 30 July 1998 Nostaw and CAP requisitioned a meeting of shareholders to be
held on 25 August 1998.  Nostaw and CAP proposed
the appointment of six
additional directors being Watson, Kelly, Liebmann, Willing and Messrs Sedgwick
and Roberts.  At the meeting
of 25 August 1998 James claimed that he held the
majority shareholding and would vote that shareholding at the meeting.
<P>

30	That meeting was adjourned and these proceedings were commenced.  By
undertakings given to the court the parties appear to have
agreed to adjourn
the meeting until these proceedings are completed. There has also been
agreement that further shares will not issue
without notice.
<P>

31	The plaintiffs, Watson, Kelly, Nostaw and CAP seek remedies including:
<P>

	31.1	Declarations and orders setting aside the management agreement, the
Sagacity Shares Issue and the James Shares Issue.
<P>

	31.2	Declarations that James, de Vries and K James breached their fiduciary
duties to DFM in causing it to enter into the Management
Agreement.
<P>

	31.3	Declarations that James has contravened ss 243ZE(2) and (3) of the
<b><i>Corporations Law</i></b> in participating in the Sagacity Shares Issue
Resolution and the James Shares Issue Resolution.
<P>

	31.4	A declaration that DFC has breached s 243ZE(2) of the <b><i>Corporations
Law</i></b> in entering into the Management Agreement.
<P>

	31.5	An order that James be prohibited from managing a corporation for such
period as the Court determines pursuant to s 230 of
the <b><i>Corporations
Law</i></b>;  
<P>

	31.6   An order pursuant to s 1317 HD of the <b><i>Corporations Law</i>
</b>that James and DCF account to DFM for an amount equal to that paid to DCF
by DFM under the Management Agreement.
<P>

	31.7	An order pursuant to s 246 AA that DFM be wound up.
<P>

32	The defendants deny the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief they seek and
raise various defences with reference to the Articles
of Association and s
243N(1) of the <b><i>Corporations Law</i></b>.
<P>

	<b>Application  opposing leave/strike out</b>
<P>

33	The challenged paragraphs of the defence provide as follows:
<P>

	<i>29	In answer to the whole of the Statement of Claim the proceedings have
been brought for improper collateral purposes and are an
abuse of
process.</i>
<P>

	<i>30	By reason of the matters alleged in par 29 above the plaintiffs are not
entitled to equitable relief as they come to the Court
with unclean hands.
</i>
<P>

34	The defence then particularises the unclean hands by reference to the
matters alleged in the cross claim.  It is therefore necessary
to consider the
cross claim.
<P>

35	The cross claim is brought by James and Sagacity (the cross claimants)
against Watson, Kelly, Nostaw and CAP (the cross-defendants).
<P>

36	The cross claimants' complaints  can be conveniently summarised as
follows:
<P>

	36.1	That the cross-defendants are in breach of their obligations under the
PolicyLink Shareholders Agreement.  This breach is
said to arise because DFM is
in competition with PolicyLink and the PolicyLink Shareholders Agreement
purports to prohibit such competition
(pars. 7 to 19). This claim is not the
subject of any claim for relief - although it seems to be relied upon to
establish the motive
to cause commercial harm to the defendants.
<P>

	36.2	That in June 1998 Watson, Kelly and PolicyLink acted in a manner that was
oppressive, unfairly prejudicial to and unfairly
discriminatory against DFM,
James and Sagacity.  The conduct claimed to give rise to this allegation is the
securing of  Auton's
agreement to change the terms of DFM's contract with
AFLPST  to DFM's financial detriment (pars. 12, 21 to 24);  and
<P>

	36.3	that Nostaw and CAPS's proposed resolutions that the six new directors be
elected to DFM's Board are oppressive, unfairly
prejudicial to and unfairly
discriminatory against DFM, James and Sagacity.
<P>

	The defendants claim that if the plaintiffs have control of DFM they will
remove James from the Board and enter into contracts
which will be detrimental
to DFM's interests. They claim the plaintiff's will either sell or wind up DFM
.
<P>

36	The cross claimants then seek declarations pursuant to s 246 AA of the
<b><i>Corporations Law</i></b> in respect of the Auton Agreement and the
proposed resolutions together with an order that the cross-defendants transfer
their shares
 to the cross claimants for the consideration of $3000 or
alternatively that the shares be valued by a referee.
<P>

	<b>Paragraph 30 unclean hands</b>
<P>

37	The bases for the plaintiffs claims for the setting aside of the various
transactions relevantly include the following:
<P>

	<b><i>The Management Agreement</i></b>
<P>

The plaintiffs claim that de Vries and K James did not act bona fide in the
interests of DFM and were in breach of their fiduciary
duties to DFM
because;
<P>

&#183;	the terms of the management agreement were less favourable to DFM than
an arms length commercial arrangement;  and
<P>

&#183;	they were motivated by an improper collateral purpose namely to increase
James' control over DFM and to divert revenue from
DFM to DCF and away from the
shareholders.
<P>

38	The defendants claim that the plaintiffs' hands are unclean because they
were diverting funds away from DFM by inducing Auton
to cancel DFM's contract
with AFLPST.  
<P>

	<b><i>The Sagacity Shares Issue</i></b>
<P>

39	The plaintiffs claim James, de Vries and K James were not acting bona fide
in respect of this transaction and were in breach
of their fiduciary duty to
DFM.  It is claimed they were motivated by an improper collateral purpose to
increase James' shareholding
in DFM and  thereby increase his influence over
the affairs of DFM.  Additionally they claim that the share issue was not
approved
by the shareholders.
<P>

40	The defendants claim that the plaintiffs' hands are unclean in respect of
this transaction because they improperly induced Auton
to change the contract
between DFM and ALFPST to DFM's detriment.
<P>

	<b><i>James Shares Issue</i></b>
<P>

41	The plaintiffs claim that James created a false document purporting to be a
resolution passed at the 18 November 1997 meeting
to induce de Vries and K
James to pass the James Shares Issue resolution.  The plaintiffs claim that
James was in breach of his fiduciary
duty, and motivated by an improper
collateral purpose namely to obtain the majority shareholding and voting
control of DFM.
<P>

42	The defendants claim that the plaintiffs' hands are unclean  once again
because of their conduct in dealing with Auton in respect
of the DFM
contract.
<P>

43	In respect of each transaction the defendants also allege the plaintiffs
have unclean hands because of their breach of the PolicyLink
shareholders
agreement and their intention to remove James from the Board and either sell or
wind up DFM.
<P>

44	The plaintiffs submit that no proper defence is disclosed because there is
no connection between the alleged wrongdoing and the
equity sued for by the
plaintiffs.<b> </b><i>FAI Insurance Ltd v Pioneer Concrete Services</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2015%20NSWLR%20552" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987)
15 NSWLR 552</a> at 561
<P>

45	In responding to these submissions Mr Bell for the defendants conceded that
there was no immediate or direct link between the
conduct alleged against the
plaintiffs and the equity for which they were suing. However Mr Bell submitted
that it was an <b><i>around the corner link</i></b>.  It is not clear from the
submissions as to how far round that corner the link is suggested to be but it
has all the hallmarks of
an allegation of  general depravity which is not a
proper basis for such a defence. <i>Dering v Earl of Winchelsea (1787) 1 Cox
Eq.Cas.318 per Eyre CB at 319))</i> 
<P>

46	In applying the  principle  that there must be an immediate and necessary
relation to the equity sued for <i>Meyers v</i> <i>Casey <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1913/50.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1913] HCA 50</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281913%29%2017%20CLR%2090" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1913) 17 CLR 90</a></i>
it is my opinion that the defence as pleaded does not have such a relation and
therefore  I refuse leave to file it.
<P>

	<b>Par 29 of the defence - abuse of process</b>
<P>

47	This paragraph purports to be in answer to the whole of the statement of
claim. The defendants claim that the proceedings have
been brought for improper
collateral purposes and are an abuse of process.
<P>

48	In support of their application the plaintiffs point immediately to the
defendants' failure to bring any application to strike
out any portion of the
plaintiff's statement of claim or any application for a stay.
<P>

49	The defendants claim the improper collateral purpose is the plaintiffs'
desire to crush DFM so as to remove it from the market
place as a competitor of
PolicyLink. Mr Bell submitted that any orders to be made in the plaintiffs'
favour in the proceedings would
be the "<i>means</i>" for the plaintiffs  to
achieve this allegedly improper collateral purpose.
<P>

50	It is important not to confuse a reprehensible motive with what is required
in a collateral abuse action - i.e. a  purpose sought
to be effected by a
litigant in bringing a proceeding when such a purpose is not within its scope
and is improper.
<P>

51	Mr White SC submits that the propositions  for which the defendants contend
in support of this paragraph of the defence are fatally
flawed. He relies
analogously in this regard on <b><i>Williams v Spautz</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/34.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 34</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%2d1992%29%20174%20CLR%20509" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991-1992) 174
CLR 509</a> at 526<b><i>;; </i></b>
<P>

<b><cite>	</cite><i>"Thus, to take an example mentioned in argument, an
alderman prosecutes another  alderman who is a political opponent for failure
to disclose a relevant pecuniary interest when voting to approve a contract,
intending to secure the opponent's conviction so that
he or she will then be
disqualified from office as an alderman by reason of that conviction, pursuant
to local government legislation
regulating the holding of such offices.  The
ultimate purpose of bringing about disqualification is not within the scope of
the criminal
process instituted by the prosecutor.  But the immediate purpose
of the prosecutor is within that scope.  And the existence of the
ultimate
purpose cannot constitute an abuse of process when that purpose is to bring
about a result for which the law provides in
the event that the proceedings
terminate in the prosecutor's favour</i></b>.
<P>

52	Mr White SC submits that this argument is applicable to the matter before
me. I agree. These proceedings are not a <i>"stalking horse to coerce the
defendants in some way entirely outside the ambit of the legal claims" </i>the
plaintiffs make.<i> </i>Varawa v Howard Smith Co Ltd <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1911/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1911] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281911%29%2013%20CLR%2035" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1911) 13 CLR 35</a> per
Isaacs J at 91).
<P>

53	 It seems to me that the remedies the plaintiffs seek  are not a means of
obtaining some advantage for which the proceedings
are not designed or for some
collateral purpose beyond what the law offers. They are proceedings properly
available to be pursued
by the plaintiffs.
<P>

57	Mr White SC relies upon <b><i>Re Polyresins Pty Ltd <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/1998/775.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] FCA 775</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2016%20ACLC%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 16 ACLC 1</a>,674
</i></b>to<b><i> </i></b>submit that the cross claimants lack standing because
<b><i>s 246AA </i></b>  does not accommodate majority shareholders with voting
control. 
<P>

58	Mr Bell submits that  S 246AA does not preclude the cross claimants from
bringing an action and submits further that I should
not follow <b><i>Re
Polyresins </i></b>in so far as it may support Mr White SC's submission.<b><i>
</i></b>
<P>

59	As to this last matter it seems to me that <b><i>Re Polyresins</i></b>
clearly supports such a proposition. His Honour said;
<P>

<b><cite>	</cite></b><i>It is not possible for the company or its directors to
act so as to oppress or unfairly prejudice or discriminate against those who
can command a majority of votes. If they should so act and take the majority
shareholder by surprise their conduct will still lack
the requisite
characteristic because the majority shareholder can act to eradicate that which
would give rise to unfairness.</i>
<P>

<i>	and</i>
<P>

<i>	A court will not be able to form the opinion that the affairs of a company
are being conducted unfairly in the relevant sense, or
that acts or omissions
of the company or resolutions of the company are unfair in the relevant sense
vis a vis a member who holds
a controlling interest in the voting shares of the
company.</i> At page 1,682-1,683.
<P>

60	His Honour also reviewed the cases cited in argument Thomas v HW Thomas Ltd
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%202%20ACLC%20610" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 2 ACLC 610</a>;Re Associated Tool Industries Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281963%29%205%20FLR%2055" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1963) 5 FLR 55</a>;Benjamin v

on this topic and concluded, inter alia, that it is <b>necessary</b> that the
applicant <b>not </b>be the controlling shareholder. at page 1,683.  His Honour
focused on the controlling shareholder.  The distinction between a majority
shareholder per se and one with control of the company is an important one.

<P>

61	His Honour's analysis is compelling particularly in the following
passages;
<P>

<i>	It is unrealistic to suppose that a company's affairs may be conducted in a
manner that is oppressive or which unfairly prejudices
or discriminates against
a member who controls a majority of votes that may be cast at a general meeting
and who can thereby remove
directors and appoint others in their stead.</i>
<P>

<i>	 and</i>
<P>

<i>	It is possible to imagine circumstances in which those charged with the
management of a company might act in such a way as to hurt
or prejudice or
discriminate against a member of a company but it is not, I think, possible to
imagine circumstances in which the
hurt or prejudice or discrimination can
amount to oppression or unfair prejudice or discrimination when the victim is
the controlling
shareholder.  In other words the conduct will lack the
requisite character because the person or persons affected by it can act to
prevent it having the character of unfairness. </i> At p 1,677 and 1, 678
<P>

62	Mr Bell submits that unlike the older English section with which the Court
was dealing in <b><i>Re HR Harmer Ltd </i></b> Cited in argument in Re
<b>Polyresins;</b>  see note 11,a case relied upon before Chesterman J,<b><i>
</i></b>the current Australian section and its immediate predecessor make no
mention of minorities. Section 210 of the Companies Act 1948
(UK) had the
heading "Minorities" but made no express reference to the term within the body
of the section.  He submits further that
the legislature could have restricted
the category of applicants within s 246AA(1) and (5) but did not do so. 
<P>

63	Mr Bell compared  the heading to s 246AA  <i>Remedies in cases of</i>
<i>oppression or injustice</i>  with the heading s 210 of the Companies Act
1948 (UK) <i>Minorities</i> and submitted that nowhere within <b><i>Part 2F.1
-Oppression</i></b> is there any reference to minorities nor any expression
that could justify an interpretation that a `member' means a minority
shareholder
or one who does not have voting control.
<P>

64	A glimmer of support is available in the judgment of Brennan J (as he then
was) in <b><i>Wayde v New South Wales Rugby League Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1980%20CLR%20459" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1980 CLR
459.</a><b><i> </i></b>where in dealing with the predecessor of s.246AA His Honour
said;
<P>

<b><i>	</i></b><i>Clearly the legislature intends to provide a greater measure
of curial protection to members of a company, <b>especially if they be in the
minority</b>, than the protection afforded under earlier Companies Acts.</i> At
471 - emphasis added.
<P>

65	Chesterman J referred to this passage in his judgment in <b><i>Re
Polyresins</i></b> At p 1,681<b><i> </i></b>and emphasised that the standing
point was not an issue in <b><i>Wayde. </i></b>After<b><i> </i></b>noting that
there was no elucidation by Brennan J of the circumstances in which the
applicant for relief may not be a minority shareholder
his honour observed
that <i>judicial opinion..seems to favour the view that the section operates
for the protection of minority interests.</i>  at 1,681 
<P>

66	Chesterman J understood  that no authority had considered the question
whether the relevant section could be invoked by a majority
shareholder.<i>
</i> at 1,679 
<P>

67	However,  the learned authors of <b><i>Ford's Principles of Corporations
Law</i></b> Professor H A J Ford AM;  The Hon. R.P. Austin &amp; I M Ramsay
had referred to Canadian authority which dealt with that question.
Their
conclusion was;
<P>

	<i>A majority shareholder is not excluded from applying but normally has a
remedy in the general meeting. If a majority  shareholder
were to apply, the
court would need to consider whether the application is made unjustly to secure
concessions from the minority.</i> Par. 11,440
<P>

68	The authors then refer to Mr Michael Rice's 1989 article  <i>The
Availability of the Oppression Remedy to Majority Shareholders in Ontario</i>.
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2016%20Canadian%20Business%20Law%20Journal%2058" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 16 Can Bus LJ 58</a> in which he reported upon the then growing trend in the
Ontario courts to allow 50% shareholders and even majority shareholders the
benefit of an oppression remedy under s 247 of the Business Corporations
Act, <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1982%20SO%201982" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1982,S.O. 1982c.4.</a> A section not materially different from s 246AA  
<P>

69	Mr Rice helpfully summarises a number of cases which are in clear support of
the authors proposition. In relation to s 244 of
the<b> </b>Ontario Business
Corporations Act, Gillespie v Overs<b> </b>(Aug. 14 1987 Ont. H.C.J.) (1987
O.J.No 747);  Yok Wing<b> </b>Hui v Yamato Steakhouse Inc. (Jan 6 1988 Ont.
H.C.J.) (1988 O.J. No 9); <b> </b>Lake Muskoka Investments (Northern and
Eastern Ltd) v Lake Muskoka Marine Ltd<b> </b>and Neal Newman<b> </b>(March 31
1989 Ont H.C.J.) In relation to s 238 of Canada Business Corporations Act
Jabaco Inc v Real Corporate Group Ltd<b> </b>(Jan 20 1989 Ont H.C.J) (1989 O.J.
No 68);  In relation to s 224 British Colombia Company Act, Cairney v Golden
Key Holdings Ltd 
<a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20BLR%20263" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) BLR 263.</a> In <b><i>Jabaco Inc v Real Corporate Group
Ltd</i></b>  (Jan 20,1989,Ont.H.C.J.) (1989) O.J. No 68.Doherty J was
considering a similar section under the Canada Business Corporation Act
 R.S.C.
1985 c. C 44. in which the standing issue raised here and in <b><i>Re
Polyresins</i></b> was argued Doherty J concluded; 
<P>

	<i>The applicant qualifies as a complainant regardless of the size of his
share position, or the degree of authority which the constitution
of the
company permits him to exercise over the affairs of the company. </i>
<P>

However in that case although the applicant held 60% of the equity it held only
50% of the voting power in the company. 
<P>

70	In <b>Cairney v Golden Key Holdings Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1987%2040%20BLR%20263" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1987 40 BLR 263</a><b> </b>a
majority shareholder was able to bring proceedings under a similar provision of
the <b>British Colombia Company Act </b>RSBC 1979 c.59.  In that case the
minority shareholder was exercising control over the financial affairs of the
company.  
<P>

71	Young J also referred to <b><i>Ford's Principles of Corporations Law
</i></b>in <b><i>International Hospitality Concepts Inc (no 2)</i></b> <b><i>
</i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2013%20ACSR%20368" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 13 ACSR 368</a><b><i> </i></b> and said that <i>a  minority may
oppress a majority so as to entitle the latter to relief in appropriate
cases.</i> at 370-371<i>  </i>It seems to me that appropriate cases will
include cases in which a majority shareholder does not hold the voting control
of the company
or is unable to exercise such control See also Vujnovich &amp;
Anor v Vujnovich <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1989/1989_21.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1989] UKPC 21</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%20BCLC%20227" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) BCLC 227</a> and Marks v Roe (unreported Supreme Court of
Vic. - Mandie J 28.5.1996.<i>.<b> </b></i>
<P>

72	Notwithstanding Chesterman J's compelling analysis I do not agree that the
section is only available for the protection of minorities.
 In my opinion this
interpretation would impose an unwarranted and restrictive gloss on the
language to use Doherty J's expression
in Jabaco Inc v Real Corporate Group Ltd
(supra) of <b><i>Part 2F.1 of the Corporations Law</i></b>.  Although one would
not expect that a controlling shareholder would need recourse to the section
the complexities of shareholders'
and/or directors' relationships within
corporate structures are such that I am not willing to rule out the possibility
of such an
event.  I am of the opinion the section can accommodate such an
applicant.  I therefore reject Mr White SC's submissions on this
aspect of the
matter. 
<P>

73	I now consider Mr White SC'c  submissions in relation to the substantive
matters within the cross claim. He submits that the
conduct pleaded in the
cross claim is not capable of falling within <b><i>s 246AA </i></b>because the
cross defendants are shareholders, not directors and;
<P>

<b><cite>	</cite></b>(a) the <b>act</b><i> </i>pleaded in paragraph 20 cannot
be an act by or on behalf of the company.<i>S246AA (2)(b);and </i>
<P>

<b><cite>	</cite></b>(b) the pleading discloses that it is not really the
resolution that is being impugned but the future conduct of a number of persons
(some parties, some not) should they be elected to the DFM Board and as such
cannot fall within <i>s 246AA(2)(b).</i>
<P>

74	When properly analysed the act alleged in par 20 is really an allegation in
the nature of inducement of a breach of contract
by two shareholders and a
third party which is not a party to these proceedings. The plaintiffs/cross
defendants were not directors
and were not authorised to bind or capable of
binding the company in any dealings they or PolicyLink  had with Auton.  Such
conduct
is in my opinion their personal conduct as shareholders and as such
cannot be part of the <i>affairs of the company or an act or omission by or on
behalf of the company.</i> Re Unisoft Group Ltd  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%201%20BCLC%20609" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 1 BCLC 609</a> at 623<b>
</b>
<P>

75	As to the proposed resolutions Mr White SC submits that what the cross
claimants are really seeking to claim are anticipatory
breaches of fiduciary
duty by persons (some only of whom are parties) if they become directors.
<P>

76	Mr Bell submits that the oppression will arise if I make orders in the
plaintiffs' favour and the resolutions are proposed at
the meeting - if it is
called. He submits the cross defendants (and other persons not named as
parties) will then pursue a malicious
path to harm the cross claimants business
interests.
<P>

77	Apart from what appears to be the prematurity of the cross claim it seems to
me that Mr White SC's submissions have force.  It
is within the shareholders
proper province to vote to appoint directors to the Board and this cross claim
seems aimed at anticipatory
breaches of fiduciary duties of those persons who
may be appointed although that also is not entirely clear.
<P>

78	In the circumstances I am of the opinion that the cross claim does not
disclose a reasonable cause of action and I will therefore
refuse leave on
terms that the defendants must file and serve any cross claim upon which they
seek to rely by 9 April 1999. The plaintiffs
are to file a defence to any such
cross claim by 16 April 1999.
<P>

<i>.	</i><b>Order</b> <b>and Directions</b>
<P>

79	1.  Leave is refused to file paragraphs 29 and 30 of the Defence and the
Cross Claim. 
<P>

<b><cite>	</cite></b>2.  I direct that the defendants are to file and serve any
amended defence and/or cross claim on or before 9 April 1999.
<P>

3.  I direct the plaintiffs to file a defence to any cross claim by 16 April,
l999.
<P>

4.  Note the matter is stood over part heard for hearing on 22, 23, 27 and 28
April.
