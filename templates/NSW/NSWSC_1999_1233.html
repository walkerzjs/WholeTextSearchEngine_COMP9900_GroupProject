MASTER MALPASS
<P>

WEDNESDAY 15 DECEMBER 1999
<P>

<u>20781/1997</u>	<u>DEREK JOHN COOKE v THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	This proceeding is one of the many arising out of the collision
between the HMAS Melbourne and the HMAS Voyager on 10 February
1964.  The
process was filed on 14 August 1997.  A Notice of Motion was filed on the same
day.  It sought an extension of the relevant
limitation period.
<P>

2  	The Notice of Motion was heard on 1 December 1999.  The plaintiff
has sworn two affidavits.  Certain exhibits were tendered
(including an
outpatient record prepared by Dr Cullen on 8 August 1968, a report from Dr
Wright dated 24 October 1996, and a report
from Dr McNamara dated 10 August
1998).  The plaintiff was cross-examined.  The defendant did not adduce any
evidence.
<P>

3  	The plaintiff was born on 26 October 1941.  He became a member of
the Royal Australian Navy on 26 March 1959.  At the time of
the collision, he
was a member of the crew of HMAS Melbourne.
<P>

4  	The affidavit material sets out his experiences following the
collision together with details of personal history since that
time.  It is not
necessary to reproduce the detail of the material in this judgment.  It
suffices to merely mention some aspects
thereof.
<P>

5  	Since the collision, the plaintiff has been aware that he has had
a number of problems (including fear of high pressure steam,
periods of
irritability and depression and a dislike of enclosed spaces).  He was aware of
a connection between these problems and
the collision.
<P>

6  	He was posted to the HMAS Vendetta.  There was a near collision
with a US ship.  He was sent by his divisional officer to see
Dr Cullen (a
consultant psychiatrist at the British Military Hospital in Singapore).
<P>

7  	Dr Cullen was of the view that the plaintiff showed no positive
signs of active psychiatric illness and that he showed no signs
of psychiatric
illness sufficient to justify any immediate medical intervention.  The
plaintiff says that he was informed by the
psychiatrist that he (the
psychiatrist) did not believe that there was anything wrong with him and that
he (the plaintiff) accepted
what he had been told by the psychiatrist.
<P>

8  	Following his return to Australia, he was drafted to a shore base
at HMAS Creswell in Jervis Bay.  Later, he was drafted to
the HMAS Melbourne.
He refused to go to that ship.  Thereafter, the draft was changed to HMAS
Stalwart.  When he had completed his
service, he left the Navy.
<P>

9  	In 1996, friends implored him to seek medical advice.  He saw an
advocate of the Department of Veterans Affairs.  He made a
claim for a service
pension.  The Department referred him to Dr Wright.  The claim for the pension
related to his service on HMAS
Vendetta.  Whilst his application for the
pension was unsuccessful, Dr Wright made him aware of a diagnosis of suffering
from post
traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse disorder.
<P>

10  	The plaintiff was referred by his present solicitors to his
treating psychiatrist (Dr McNamara) for a report.  In his report,
Dr McNamara
makes a diagnosis of chronic post traumatic stress disorder together with
secondary alcohol abuse which he relates to
the collision.  The plaintiff
continues to be treated by Dr McNamara.
<P>

11  	Relief is sought pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</u>
1969</a>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60i.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 60I</a> prohibits the making of an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s60g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 60G</a> unless the
court is satisfied of matters set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection
(1) thereof.  These are threshold requirements
to the making of an order.  When
the threshold requirements have been satisfied, there is a discretionary power
to grant relief.
<P>

12  	The defendant has put submissions in opposition to the
application (and I should add without great enthusiasm).  It is said
that by
1968 the plaintiff was aware that personal injury had been suffered, of the
nature and extent of the personal injury and
of the connection between it and
the defendant's act or omission.  Further, as a discretionary consideration, it
says that there
has been prejudice by reason of delay.
<P>

13  	In my view, the threshold requirements have been satisfied.
Whether or not he was unaware that personal injury had been suffered
at the
expiration of the relevant limitation period, I am satisfied that he was
unaware of the nature and the extent of the personal
injury.  The distinction
between knowing of problems and an awareness that the problems amounted to a
psychiatric illness has been
drawn in many cases (see inter alia <u>Darcy v The
Commonwealth of Australia</u>, 25 July 1997).  I do not regard this as a case
where the plaintiff was merely unaware of the precise description of the
condition
from which he was suffering.  In the light of this finding, it is
unnecessary to pursue the question of whether or not he was unaware
of the
connection between the personal injury and the defendant's act or omission.
However, for completeness, I observe that I accept
the plaintiff's affidavit
evidence on this matter.  Accordingly, I am of the view that this threshold
requirement has also been satisfied.
<P>

14  	I now turn to the question of prejudice.  There is no dispute
that there has been substantial delay.  There is no evidence
of actual
prejudice.  The only prejudice that can be asserted is that of the presumptive
kind arising from the delay itself (see
<u>Brisbane South Regional Health
Authority v Taylor</u> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2070%20ALJR%20866" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 70 ALJR 866).</a>  It is not suggested that the
defendant has lost any of its relevant records.  It had the plaintiff examined
by a psychiatrist in
1968.  He was once again examined by a psychiatrist on
their behalf in 1996.  He did not see his own psychiatrist until February
1997.
<P>

15  	There is presumptive prejudice.  However, despite the
presumptive prejudice, I am of the view that a fair trial of the relevant
issues can still take place.
<P>

16  	The plaintiff bears the onus of satisfying the court that he has
an entitlement to relief.  In the relevant circumstances of
this case, I am
satisfied that the onus has been discharged.
<P>

17  	Accordingly, I have reached the decision that it is just and
reasonable to make the order sought and that such an order should
be made in
this case.
<P>

18  	I extend the limitation period for the cause of action pleaded
in the Statement of Claim up to and including 14 August 1997.
 I reserve the
question of costs.  The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
