<b>JUDGMENT  (On admissibility of evidence on Defendant's Motion to set aside
Notices to Produce)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  In the course of an application being made by the defendant to
have set aside a Notice to Produce issued on 23 February
1999, being the Notice
identified as NP4 in these applications, a question of admissibility of
evidence has arisen.
<P>

2	The evidence sought to be admitted is documentary and is constituted by
correspondence and other material on its face sourced
in the Police Service.
The material has been tendered in the context of a submission being made for
the plaintiff in support of the
Notice to Produce that compliance with the
Notice would lead to the production of material capable of showing that the
Police Service,
in complying with a subpoena issued on 18 January 1999 by the
defendant, had conducted itself less than impartially as between the
plaintiff
and the defendant in this litigation.
<P>

3	The documentation constituting the tender was produced to the court by the
Police Service in answer to a subpoena to the Police
Service issued by the
plaintiff and has been inspected by both parties.  The subpoena was issued by
the plaintiff on 23 February
1999 and made returnable on 25 February 1999.  The
material was tendered to prove, shortly stated, that there is no foundation and
cannot be any foundation for the suggestion implicit in the plaintiff's
position that compliance with the Notice to Produce would
bring to light
material showing that the police had been less than impartial in complying with
the subpoena.
<P>

4	The tender is objected to on essentially three bases:
<P>

	(1)  It is not relevant to the issue I have sought to articulate within the
application to set aside the Notice to Produce;  
<P>

	(2)  It would not be admissible under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 69</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act, 1995</a></i> by
reason of at least the operation of sub-sections 3 and 5;  and
<P>

	(3)  As I understand it, goes to an ultimate issue relating to the
determination of whether or not the Notice to Produce should
be set aside.
<P>

5	The recitation of the events leading to this point in the application to set
aside the Notice to Produce, which itself is part
of at least two other
substantive interlocutory applications, exposes a frightening tendency:  for
every step in this case to run
away into side issues.  The fundamental issue I
have to decide on bases available to me, other than any potential exposure by
production
of material relating to a want of impartiality on the part of the
police, is whether or not the Notice should be set aside.
<P>

6	I propose to refuse to admit the evidence, exercising my discretion under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 135(1)(c)</a>, if not (b), of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a> </i>principally, if I
might candidly say so, with a view to trying to do justice on an application to
tender within an application within
another application of the parties and to
keep the conduct of this litigation under a degree of control.  I would also
exclude the
evidence at this stage under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 135(a)</a> insofar as it is pressed as
to the truth of its contents.
<P>

7	I will have the material marked for identification 1 on the defendant's
application to set aside Notice to Produce 4. I decline
to admit the tendered
documents.
