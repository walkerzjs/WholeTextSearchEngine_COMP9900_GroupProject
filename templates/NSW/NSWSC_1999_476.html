<b>HULME J</b>
<P>

<center><b><u>Neil DODD v John William CREGAN</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></center>
<P>


<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR</b>: These Reasons concern an appeal by way of stated case from
a decision of Mr Lulham, Magistrate, made on 10 September 1997.
<P>

2	The Respondent to the appeal sued the Appellant for the sum of $33,000 plus
interest and costs claimed to be owing as the balance
of the sale price for the
sale of the Respondent's interest in a Mack Prime Mover.  The Magistrate found
in favour of the Respondent
as claimed.  The Magistrate also rejected a
cross-claim alleging fraudulent misrepresentation.
<P>

3	The agreement between the parties was constituted by, or included - a matter
in issue in the stated case - a document which, so
far as is relevant, was in
the following terms:-
<P>

	"Neil Dodd
<P>

11 Foster Street
<P>

QUEANBEYAN NSW 2620
<P>

				TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN
<P>

	This is to state that I Neil Dodd of 11 Fosters Street Queanbeyan.
<P>

	Will take over the contract from John Gregan (sic) Temora NSW for a MACK Prime
Mover	Reg No<b> KPP-199</b>
<P>

				Chassis No <b>A18 270</b>
<P>

	The contract is held with Esanda Finance Co.
<P>

	Contract No..........................................
<P>

	I will continue with this contract until the final payment is made.
<P>

	Payments must be within 21 days of the due date. If payments are not paid
within the due time the contract in null &amp; void.
<P>

	A payment of <b>$33,000</b> is to be paid to <b>Mal Rigby SYD</b>
<P>

<b>	</b>(To be returned in the same condition.)
<P>

							Neil Dodd"
<P>

4	The words and figures set out in bold were handwritten in the document.
There was an indication, and the magistrate found, that
the words "to be
returned in the same condition" were intended to form part of the paragraph
commencing "payments must be".  The
document was signed by both parties.
<P>

<b>The Magistrate's Findings</b>
<P>

5	Included within the Magistrate's findings of fact were the following (I have
numbered them for convenience.):- 
<P>

	"(1)  The Defendant took possession of the vehicle, made about 12 payments to
Esanda being the balance of the monthly payments.
<P>

	(2)  The Defendant did not pay the residual payment of $42, 800 due to Esanda.
The vehicle was repossessed and an agent, David
Cannon (?) (sic) apparently
paid out the sum of about $46,000 to Esanda and the vehicle was then
transferred back to the Defendant
and another person by that agent David
Cannon. ...
<P>

	(3)  The effect of those transactions was that Esanda had been paid out in
full but the payment of $33,000 directed to be paid
to Mal Ridley (sic) was not
paid and it is in relation to that non-payment that the Plaintiff brings his
claim to recover that sum.
...
<P>

	(4)  The hire purchase agreement with Esanda contained the following terms
<P>

		"NOT TO PART WITH POSSESSION
<P>

	Clause E. 
<P>

	(5)  The lessee shall keep the goods under his personal control and shall not
attempt or purport to sell, dispose or encumber the
same or any interest
therein nor without the lessor's prior written consent shall the lessee sell or
encumber nor agree to sell or
encumber any land to which the goods at any time
be affixed. 
<P>

	NOT TO ASSIGN
<P>

	Clause F
<P>

	(6)  The lessee shall not assign this agreement or the lessee's rights
hereunder."
<P>

	(7)  The evidence indicates that Esanda were informed by the defendant that he
was then paying the lease fees and had possession
of the vehicle, and the
evidence indicates that Esanda accepted that position.  It may be that action
by Esanda may have created
an estoppel against Esanda ...(but) that is not a
matter for me to decide.
<P>

	(8)  ... the agreement does not refer specifically to any payment of the
residual but the agreement did obviously not include all
of the agreements
reached between the parties, for instance it is clear that there was an
agreement that the defendant whilst having
the vehicle was to pay the
registration and the insurance and to keep it in good condition.  The agreement
does of course refer to
a final payment.
<P>

	(9)  The plaintiff did inform the defendant of the existence of the residual
payment and that the defendant was liable to pay it
<P>

	(10)  ... the only representation made by the plaintiff was to the effect that
the truck was a good one or was in good condition.
I am not satisfied on the
evidence that the plaintiff made any other more specific representation.
<P>

	(11)  I am satisfied on the evidence particularly on the evidence of Stan
Wilson that at the time of the transfer the Plaintiff's
interest in the truck,
bearing in mind that it had done 1,000,000 kilometres, that the truck was in
good condition mechanically,
that it had been serviced properly and was in good
condition on the exterior.
<P>

	(12)  Further, even if I be wrong and in fact a more specific representation
was made, ... I am not satisfied on the evidence that
any representation made
by the plaintiff induced the defendant to enter into the agreement. The
defendant was a truck operator experienced
in the use and inspection of trucks.
That was his business. He had a test drive, he had every opportunity for any
inspection he required.
I am not satisfied that it was any representation made
by the plaintiff that induced the plaintiff to purchase the vehicle. 
<P>

6	The magistrate's reference to a hire-purchase agreement would seem to have
been in error.  Although the document governing the
rights inter se of the
Respondent and Esanda was not tendered before me, it is referred to throughout
the transcript of proceedings
before the magistrate as a "lease".  There was no
suggestion in that transcript of before me that the Credit Act applied.
<P>

<b>Grounds of Appeal</b>
<P>

7	The Stated Case records as the bases for the magistrate's Determination, and
the Appellant's Contentions, the following:-
<P>

<u>Grounds of Determination</u>
<P>

<b>	</b>1.  Upon the transfer of possession of the truck to the defendant, the
lease agreement between the plaintiff and ESANDA was voidable
at the option of
ESANDA.
<P>

	2.  ESANDA was informed by the defendant that he was paying under the lease
(Exhibit 1) and accepted that position.
<P>

	3.  The plaintiff and defendant entered into a legally binding agreement
(Exhibit 3).
<P>

	4.  The said agreement (Exhibit 3) did not include all the terms therein.
<P>

	5.  The plaintiff informed the defendant that a residual payment of $42,800
was to be made to ESANDA.
<P>

	6.  The plaintiff made no representation about the truck other than it was a
good one and in good condition.
<P>

	7.  The said representation did not induce the defendant to enter into the
agreement.
<P>

<u>Appellant's Contentions</u>
<P>

<b>	</b>1.  The plaintiff was bailee for reward from ESANDA as bailor pursuant
to a written contract of hire in respect of a prime mover vehicle.
<P>

	2.  The plaintiff had no legal capacity right or entitlement to sell or
otherwise transfer possession of the subject motor vehicle
without the consent
of ESANDA.
<P>

	3.  The plaintiff's transfer of possession of the subject motor vehicle to the
defendant pursuant to an agreement for sale between
them was in and constituted
a breach by the plaintiff of the contract between the plaintiff and ESANDA.
<P>

	4.  ESANDA exercised their immediate right to possession of the subject motor
vehicle against the defendant as a third party to
the bailment between
themselves and the plaintiff by reason of the plaintiff's failure refusal
and/or neglect to pay monies due under
the said contract of hire.
<P>

	5.  The agreement of sale of the subject motor vehicle from the plaintiff to
the defendant was incapable of creating any legal
relationship between them
other than a sub bailment between the defendant as bailee and the plaintiff as
bailor of the subject motor
vehicle. 
<P>

	6.  The agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant for the sale of the
subject motor vehicle to the defendant was ineffective
and void by reason of
failed consideration, mistake and/or frustration.
<P>

	7.  The said agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant did not contain
a term or condition, or otherwise impose any liability
upon the defendant to
pay any monies to ESANDA by way of "residual payment" or such similar payment
in the amount of $42,000 or any
amount at all.
<P>

	8.  The written agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant for the sale
of the subject motor vehicle contained the whole
of the terms thereof and could
not be altered by parole (sic) evidence.
<P>

	9.  There was no evidence upon which a finding could be made that ESANDA
accepted or consented to the defendant being the assignee
of its lease to the
plaintiff.
<P>

	10.  There was no evidence upon which a finding could be made that the
plaintiff and the defendant entered into a binding agreement.
<P>

	11.  There was no evidence or insufficient evidence upon which a finding could
be made that the defendant was not induced by the
plaintiff to enter into the
agreement.
<P>

	12.  There was no evidence or insufficient evidence upon which a finding could
be made that the plaintiff informed the defendant
that a residual payment of
$42,800.00 was to be made to ESANDA."
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

8	It will be convenient to deal with the above grounds and contentions largely
seriatim.
<P>

<u>Ground 1</u>
<P>

9	It was agreed that this proposition is correct.
<P>

<u>Ground 2</u>
<P>

10	It was submitted that there was no evidence to support this finding.  In
fact in a statement by the Appellant which was before
the  magistrate, the
Appellant said:-
<P>

	"Several days later (than taking of delivery of the vehicle) I telephoned
Esanda and said that I was making the payments on the
lease.  The person that I
spoke to was pleased that the payments were to be made, and that the arrears
would be brought up to date."
<P>

11	The Appellant in fact made payments virtually monthly from early October
1993 to late May 1994.  Clearly there was evidence to
justify the conclusions
referred to in this ground.  In any event the conclusions were not essential to
the magistrate's conclusions.
<P>

<u>Ground 3</u>
<P>

12	The challenge to this finding is dealt with under Contentions 5, 6, 7 and 10
below.
<P>

<u>Ground 4</u>
<P>

13	A challenge to this finding, and Contention 8 were abandoned.
<P>

<u>Ground 5</u>
<P>

14	In a number of places the transcript records the Respondent giving evidence
to this effect.  It was challenged and the subject
of contrary evidence but the
magistrate was entitled to accept what the Respondent said.  The challenge to
this finding, contained
in Contention 12 is hopeless.
<P>

<u>Grounds 6 &amp; 7</u>
<P>

15	The challenge to these matters is dealt with under Contention 11 below.
<P>

<u>Contentions 1 - 6</u>
<P>

16	It is convenient to consider these Contentions together.  The propositions
advanced in Contentions 1 to 4 may be accepted as
flowing from the nature and
terms of the lease agreement between the Respondent and Esanda, and the events
which occurred as found
by the magistrate.  However the same cannot be said of
the matters asserted in contentions 5 and 6 and these propositions do not
necessarily follow from the those contained in Contentions 1 to 4.  Although
they could not thereby affect Esanda's interests, against
the background of
them, the Appellant and Respondent were at liberty under the general law to
make whatever agreement they liked
concerning the prime mover and the
obligations and rights the Respondent had under the Hire Purchase agreement.
Contrary to the proposition
in Contention 5, the parties were able to create a
contractual relationship binding between themselves.
<P>

17	Of course, any contract entered into might fail for want of consideration,
mistake, frustration or other causes but whether it
did would depend on its
terms.  Here the written document expressly recognised the existence of the
contract between Esanda and the
Respondent.  It is a necessary consequence
that, by implication, the written document also recognised the terms of the
Esanda contract,
whether in fact they were known to the Appellant.  In that
situation, one would not readily infer any contractual intention as between
the
Appellant and Respondent to over-reach Esanda's rights.  As a matter of
construction the written document does not attempt to
do so.  There is nothing
in the document which either in terms or by implication purports to confer on
the Respondent any title or
right to possession as against Esanda.  The
document does say that "Neil Dodd ... will take over the (Esanda) contract" but
in light
of the overall document those words cannot be regarded otherwise than
as qualified along the lines "subject to its terms" or "for
what rights that
contract gives".
<P>

18	There was no want of consideration and, given the contract's terms, no basis
for any conclusion that the contract failed due
to mistake or frustration.
<P>

19	The contract does say that "if payments are not paid within the due time the
contract is null and void."  However, given the
respective benefits obtained,
and obligations imposed, by the contract, this must mean "null and void at the
option of the Respondent.
 On the proper construction of the contract, the
Appellant could not take advantage of his own failure to make payments to avoid
the contract.
<P>

20	Grounds 1 to 4 would seem to be made out but of themselves they are of no
present benefit to the Appellant.  Grounds 5 and 6
fail.
<P>

<u>Contention 7</u>
<P>

21	This raises a simple question of construction of the written document.
Except by reference to the Esanda contract, the written
document nowhere
identifies the payments or obligations under the Esanda contract which the
Respondent was to "continue" or undertake.
 It is clear that there were some
payments he had to make and the undertaking to "continue with this (Esanda)
contract until the
final payment is made" carries the consequence that these
payments were all, not merely whatever monthly or other instalment, payments
to
which Esanda was entitled.  As a matter of statutory construction , this is so
whether or not the Respondent was informed of the
final $42,000 payable to
Esanda.
<P>

<u>Contention 8</u>
<P>

22	This Contention - a challenge to the finding referred to in ground 4 above,
was abandoned.
<P>

<u>Contention 9</u>
<P>

23	Sufficient, and separate, responses to this Contention is that the
magistrate made no finding that Esanda accepted or consented
to the defendant
(the Appellant) being the assignee of its lease to the Plaintiff and no such
finding was essential to his Worship's
conclusion.  The finding referred to in
Ground 2 above did not go as far as that Esanda accepted the Appellant as
assignee.
<P>

<u>Contention 10</u>
<P>

24	It is not clear to me to what particular facet of events this contention is
directed.  The subject matter - physical possession
and presumably use of a
prime mover, and payments of thousands of dollars to a finance company argues
for any agreement relating
thereto being intended to be binding.  The terms of
the document are directed to defining the rights of the parties to it in
respect
of such matters and again indicate an intention that the document
should be binding.  Subject to other matters dealt with specifically
herein, I
can see no basis for upholding this contention.  That the Respondent took
actual possession of the prime mover and made
some 12 monthly payments to
Esanda also argue, at least in some respects, in favour of the agreement being
binding.
<P>

<u>Contention 11</u>
<P>

25	This contention misstates the magistrate's relevant conclusion.  The
pleadings were not before me but the topic seems to relate
to the Appellant's
cross-claim rather than to any defence.  The onus of proof lay on the Appellant
to satisfy the magistrate that
he was induced by actions of the Respondent as
he claimed.  It is unnecessary to set out his findings in this regard but it is
clear
that the magistrate had reservations about the reliability or credibility
of the Appellant.  In these circumstances the magistrate
was clearly entitled
to conclude that "I am not satisfied on the evidence that any representation
made by the plaintiff induced the
defendant to enter into the agreement".
There was evidence to support the last few of his other findings set out
including that referred
to in Ground 6.
<P>

<u>Contention 12</u>
<P>

26	This contention fails - see under Ground 5 above.
<P>

<b>Summary</b>
<P>

27	All of the challenges to the decision of the magistrate fail.  The
appropriate orders therefore are:-
<P>

	(1)  The summons is dismissed.
<P>

	(2)  I order the Appellant to pay the Respondent's costs.
