Orders made as sought by plaintiff

JUDGMENT:

THE SUPREME COURT
<P>

OF NEW SOUTH WALES
<P>

EQUITY DIVISION
<P>

AUSTIN J
<P>

WEDNESDAY 30 JUNE 1999
<P>

<b>2329/99 - DoCS  v  Y AND Z, PARENTS OF X</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (published to the parties 30 June 1999;  revised and published
generally 7 July 1999)</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  These proceedings began by summons filed on 12 May
1999.  The plaintiff sought orders that X be made a ward of
this Court under
the custody, care and control of the plaintiff, and that she be moved to the
New Children's Hospital at Westmead
where the plaintiff would be empowered to
authorise such medical procedures as may on medical advice be considered proper
or desirable
in X's interest.  
<P>

2  	The matter came before me on 12, 13, 14, 17 and 24 May 1999, and
on each occasion I made various interlocutory orders.  On 17
May 1999 I
ordered, amongst other things, that X be made a ward of this Court and that
certain proceedings commenced by the plaintiff
under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Care and
Protection) Act 1987</a> (NSW) in the Children's Court of New South Wales in
respect of X be stayed pending further order.  Those orders were made with the
consent of the defendants, X's parents, and also with the consent of counsel
who appeared as the separate representative of X.  In
the exercise of the
Court's inherent jurisdiction which I shall describe, I allowed X to appear by
a special representative, by analogy
with the statutory provisions which govern
the representation of children in proceedings under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Care and
Protection) Act 1987</a> (NSW) and the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act 1975</a> (Cth).
<P>

3  	On 24 May 1999, I made further orders, some of which had been
opposed by the defendants.  The effect of my orders on 24 May
1999 was to
require that X be returned to the New Children's Hospital at Westmead without
her consent, to resume a course of treatment
there which had been interrupted
when she left the hospital on 20 April 1999.  I made an order authorising the
staff of the New Children's
Hospital to detain X, using reasonable force if
necessary, and I directed that the doctors responsible for her treatment
provide
a written report to the Court on or before 12 July 1999 as to her
treatment, progress and general well-being.  The effect of my orders
was
temporarily to exclude the defendants from any say in the medical treatment of
their daughter, and from access to their daughter
in the New Children's
Hospital except with the plaintiff's consent or by further order of this Court.

<P>

4  	I shall return to describe my orders in more detail later, but I
provide this outline at the outset in order to make clear the
serious issues
which this case has raised.  At stake have been the liberty of X and the right
of her parents to have access to their
daughter and influence her medical
treatment.  In the extraordinary circumstances of the case I have decided that
it is necessary,
for a temporary period, to restrict X's liberty and to prevent
her parents from having any say in her treatment, or any access to
her except
with the plaintiff's consent.  
<P>

5  	Although strictly speaking my orders to date have been
interlocutory, I have endeavoured to make findings of fact on the balance
of
probabilities, for the limited purpose of granting the temporary relief which
has been sought.  I have had to make an allowance
for gaps in the evidence of a
kind which are inevitable in an urgent application, but in view of the very
serious personal consequences
for X and her parents, I have not thought it
appropriate to require the plaintiff to demonstrate only that there is a
serious question
to be tried and that the balance of convenience favours the
granting of the relief:  see <i>Re J </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%203%20WLR%20507" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 3 WLR 507</a>, 516 per Lord
Donaldson MR.
<P>

<b>Background</b>
<P>

6  	The justification for orders with such serious consequences can
be understood only after a careful examination of the history
of X's illness.
She is now 15 years old.  Until her hospitalisation, she lived with her mother
and father and two elder brothers
in suburban Sydney, and attended a small
private high school where she was evidently happy and doing well, apart from
her illness.
 Her parents are well educated and hold positions of
responsibility.  Her father is employed by a government department, and her
mother is a teacher at the school which X attends.  X has enjoyed a stable,
loving and caring home and family environment.  
<P>

<b>X's illness - 1995 to August 1996 </b>
<P>

7  	In about June 1995 X began to complain of pains in her digestive
system, for which she was at first treated by the family's
general medical
practitioner.  She developed a pattern of abnormal eating and suffered
substantial weight loss, complaining that
the pain prevented her from eating.
X and her parents consulted Dr Christine Hughes, a consultant paediatrician, on
5 January 1996
and subsequently.  Dr Hughes referred to some unusual behaviour
and neglect of personal hygiene by X, and formed the opinion that
her problem
was primarily psychological, although she ordered some tests to exclude any
physical cause.  The results of the tests
did not exclude very mild reflux, but
confirmed Dr Hughes' opinion that X's abnormal eating was not due to any
physical cause. Dr
Hughes' opinion was shared by her gastroenterology
colleague, Dr John Mitchell.  
<P>

8  	Dr Hughes described X as thin and undernourished when she first
met her in January 1996.  Her weight at that time was 35 kg
but it had dropped
to 30-32 kg in the following March.  Dr Hughes suggested to X's parents that
their daughter be referred to a child
and adolescent psychiatrist, but the
parents declined and said they would arrange their own counsellor.  Over the
ensuing couple
of months Dr Hughes made occasional phone calls to the family to
ask about X's progress and the family said she was managing well
with the
assistance of their counsellor.
<P>

<b>In-patient at Sutherland Hospital - August to December 1996</b>
<P>

9  	X continued to lose weight during 1996, and was admitted to
Sutherland Hospital on 25 August 1996 weighing only 23 kg.  While
in hospital
she was treated by Dr Chris Rikard-Bell, a family, child and adolescent
psychiatrist, who had also seen her before her
admission.  In his subsequent
report Dr Rikard-Bell said that X's weight loss and physical state were
`alarming' and he expressed
the view that at that time her weight should have
been about 38 kg.  
<P>

10  	X was in Sutherland Hospital for over three months.  She was
immediately placed on nasogastric re-feeding but she still lost
a small amount
of weight.  According to Dr Rikard-Bell, it was discovered that she was
disconnecting her feed, interfering with the
nasogastric tube and disposing of
the food.  After some weeks she was placed on a strict supervision programme
and monitored after
each feed, and gained weight, reaching 32.9 kg when she was
discharged on 1 December 1996.  
<P>

11  	Dr Rikard-Bell noted that despite the obvious improvement, X
continued to try to sabotage her re-feeding, and it was even suspected
that she
may have been syphoning food out of her stomach.  Dr Rikard-Bell advised the
family to attend family therapy sessions but
he says he encountered a great
deal of reluctance on the part of X's parents and brothers.  He says that X's
parents did not accept
the treatment programme of the hospital, because they
believed that X's problems were gastrointestinal, despite medical evidence
to
the contrary.  He says they would constantly question whether the right amount
of feed was being given and would insist that variations
of a few millilitres
be corrected.  
<P>

12  	He found it necessary to confront them about whether they were
prepared to accept X's treatment in hospital.  He told X's father
than unless a
jointly agreed treatment plan could be reached, he would hold grave concerns
about the possibility of X's recovery,
and he recommended family therapy
sessions twice per week.  Rather than following that advice, X's parents
discharged her from hospital
on 1 December 1996, three days after the
confrontation with Dr Rikard-Bell had occurred.  
<P>

13  	Dr Rikard-Bell contacted the Department of Community Services
(`DoCS').  DoCS decided not to object to X staying at home as
long as she could
keep her weight above 30 kg.  They arranged a case conference attended by X's
father, who maintained that the cause
of X's illness was physiological, but
agreed that if her weight fell to 30 kg or less she would be hospitalised.
<P>

14  	When X was weighed by her general practitioner some five days
after her discharge, her weight had fallen by nearly three kilograms,
and so
DoCS sought the urgent admission of X to the Sydney Children's Hospital, a
course to which X's parents agreed only after DoCS
threatened them with
proceedings.  
<P>

15  	In his report dated 12 December 1996 Dr Rikard-Bell expressed
grave concerns about X's welfare, saying that the major obstacle
to X being
able to recover was the behaviour of her parents, who were unable or unwilling
to accept that there were psychological
and family issues which contributed to
X's condition.  He said that the parents' denial or resistance was extreme.  It
appears that
Dr Rikard-Bell clashed with X's parents but I see no reason to
disbelieve his account of the facts.
<P>

16  	X's parents say that when they discharged their daughter from
Sutherland Hospital, they acted with medical advice.  They had
arranged for her
to be examined by Dr Sandra Cabot, a general practitioner who has written books
on diets and nutrition.  Dr Cabot
diagnosed X as having irritable bowel
syndrome for which she advised the liver cleansing diet about which she has
written.  Dr Cabot
prescribed some medication to relieve reflux pain and
advised that X was of a safe weight to be allowed home.  X's parents say that
during her few days out of hospital, X developed a virus and vomited profusely,
losing over two kilograms in weight because of that
illness.
<P>

<b>In-patient at Sydney Children's Hospital (Prince of Wales) - 6 December 1996
to 10 January 1997</b>
<P>

17  	X was admitted to the Sydney Children's Hospital (Prince of
Wales) on 6 December 1996 under the care of Dr Hughes.  On admission
her weight
was measured at 30.2 kg.  Dr Hughes says she was `horrified' at X's appearance,
and noticed that she was extremely pale
and extraordinarily thin.  Her hair was
lank and dirty and she appeared apathetic.  She had grown less than one
centimetre in a year,
though an average 12 year old would have grown eight or
more centimetres in this time.  Dr Hughes says this reflected extreme
malnutrition
which could have long term consequences. 
<P>

18  	Dr Hughes consulted Dr Bohane, a paediatric gastroenterologist,
who recommended further tests, which were duly carried out.
 Dr Bohane then
said he did not believe that X's epigastric pain would be sufficient to cause
her eating disorder, though he acknowledged
the possibility of some mild
dyspepsia.  He expressed the opinion that no further gastroenterological
investigations were necessary.
 
<P>

19  	According to Dr Hughes, the main difficulties that she
experienced during X's time in the Sydney Children's Hospital were difficulties
relating to her parents.  The parents reported that X had felt nauseous and had
diarrhoea and constipation whilst on nasogastric
feeding at Sutherland.
Therefore, after consulting a paediatric dietitian and adolescent
psychiatrists, Dr Hughes and the hospital
staff designed an oral re-feeding
regime and it was agreed that nasogastric feeding would not be started if X
could maintain or increase
her weight.  Subsequently X did start to eat and
drink more but there was no weight gain for the ensuing three weeks, although
she
had a 1.4 kg weight gain during the last week of hospitalisation.  
<P>

20  	One explanation for the disappointing weight gain could be some
information in the discharge summary from the hospital, which
said that the
parents were observed to support a vegetarian diet for X, and to bring food to
the hospital for her, and sometimes
to eat part of the meals given to her by
the hospital.  X's father admits to eating some of his daughter's food but says
he always
told the supervising nurse how much his daughter had actually
eaten.
<P>

21  	According to Dr Hughes' report and the discharge summary, X
benefited from therapy sessions and she interacted well with staff
and other
patients, and was `quite chatty and motivated'.  Nevertheless X's parents say
that she was traumatised by hospitalisation.
 X's father says that his daughter
was very unhappy at the Sydney Children's Hospital, and that on one occasion he
and his wife found
her perched on a verandah ledge threatening to jump off
because she found the programme so oppressive.
<P>

22  	According to Dr Hughes, from the very first day of X's time in
the Sydney Children's Hospital her parents were trying to find
ways to
discharge her.  The parents suggested that her local doctor should monitor her
care at home, but the local doctor responded
that he was unable to provide a
sufficient level of expert treatment.  They requested that X return to
Sutherland Hospital, but doctors
there told Dr Hughes that X's condition was
sufficiently serious that she needed to be in a tertiary paediatric hospital
like the
Sydney Children's Hospital.  The parents contacted a general
practitioner who was a pastor in their church, but after discussing
the case
with Dr Hughes, he agreed that X required tertiary paediatric management.  Then
the parents requested a transfer to St George
hospital, but again, after
discussion with Dr Hughes, the doctors there were very reluctant to take on a
complicated potentially
long-stay patient from outside the hospital's area, and
felt that tertiary paediatric treatment was needed.
<P>

23  	X's father then proposed that his daughter be allowed to attend
a programme at the Clear Mountain Health Resort in Queensland.
 In my opinion
this is a revealing incident, suggesting an attitude on the part of the parents
to their daughter's treatment which
seems to have continued up to the hearing
of these proceedings.  On inquiry, Dr Hughes discovered that this programme
revolved around
good eating, relaxation, meditation and physical therapies,
such as aerobics and bush walking.  She regarded it as a good programme
for
adults with stress and weight problems, but the resort had never had a child
with an eating disorder and had never had a young
adolescent in their
programme.  Dr Hughes decided that X's health was too critical to risk her
becoming a guinea pig under the care
of people who had no experience with
children like her.  Dr Hughes' conclusion so much accords with practical common
sense that one
can only wonder about the parents' understanding and
judgment.
<P>

24  	X's father says the resort was a `private hospital' run by a
`fully accredited doctor' who had various qualifications including
a PhD in
nutrition and graduate diploma in paediatric care.  He says that he discussed
his daughter's situation with the doctor at
length, concluding as follows:  `I
believe his qualifications are more than adequate to be meeting my daughter's
needs'.  To my mind
this evidence demonstrates that even at the hearing, X's
father did not properly appreciate his daughter's serious medical condition.
<P>

25  	The parents' final suggestion to Dr Hughes was that X be
discharged from hospital into the care of Dr George Williams, a paediatrician
who lived not far from their home.  Dr Hughes discussed X's case with Dr
Williams.  She felt that X would be much safer in hospital
than as an
outpatient and that as the programme was finally working, it would be a pity
for her to be removed.  Dr Williams said
he was keen to take on X's care as an
outpatient, and said he would use a team approach where she would also be seen
by the adolescent
medical service and others at the New Children's Hospital at
Westmead.  Dr Williams said that if the family did not comply with his
proposed
treatment, he would notify DoCS.  X would be given a weekly weight goal and her
parents would write out what she was eating
at each meal.  If she did not make
the weekly weight goal, he would admit her to the New Children's Hospital.  The
highly specific
nature of Dr Williams' proposals is important, in light of what
subsequently occurred.  I infer that Dr Williams communicated these
arrangements to X's parents.  
<P>

26  	Dr Hughes discussed Dr Williams' proposal with her colleagues
and officers of DoCS, and they decided that while this was not
the best plan
for management of X's condition, there would be insufficient basis for DoCS to
seek an order that X be kept in hospital,
and so they reluctantly agreed to
allow X to be discharged.  
<P>

27  	It is clear that the tension which had emerged between X's
parents and Dr Rikard-Bell at Sutherland Hospital was to a degree
replicated at
the Sydney Children's Hospital.  In his evidence X's father says he agreed with
the objectives of the eating disorder
programme there, but objected to the
reality of how the programme was enforced.  He complains about the physical
environment at the
hospital's Adolescent Unit, referring to cockroaches and
fleas and the noise of an adjacent construction site, and the absence of
shower
curtains in bathrooms which were for both sexes.  
<P>

28  	He says that according to his daughter, two members of the
nursing staff had a conversation in her presence about how ugly,
scrawny and
revolting X's body looked, and another member of the nursing staff told X that
he could smell methane gas coming out
of her body because she was dying.  The
truth or falsity of these allegations was not fully explored before me.  Their
source is
X's uncorroborated account.  It would be understandable for a person
in X's position to misinterpret and take offence at remarks
which were not
offensive when viewed objectively.  I am inclined to the view that these are
exaggerated accounts of incidents which,
if they occurred, were more prosaic
and unobjectionable. 
<P>

29  	Viewing the evidence as a whole, I regard it as reasonably clear
that X and her parents collaborated to develop objections
to the programme and
her treatment, and to identify matters for complaint.  I believe Dr Hughes'
account that according to her observation
and the observation of the hospital
staff, X frequently behaved in a well-adjusted and co-operative way.  It is
plausible to infer,
and I do infer, that her discontent developed out of or was
encouraged by her parents' visits.  X's father says that she concealed
her
inner feelings from the staff but in my opinion, the more plausible explanation
is that she was genuinely contented when outside
the reach of her parents'
influence.  
<P>

<b>Professor Beumont's assessment</b>
<P>

30  	DoCS also arranged to have X assessed by Professor Pierre
Beumont, Professor and Head of the Department of Psychological Medicine
at the
University of Sydney, whose report dated 3 February 1997 is in evidence.  
<P>

31  	Professor Beumont reviewed medical correspondence about X, and
interviewed her, her parents and brothers.  He found that X
had set out on a
two year course of restrictive eating, active resistance to regaining normal
weight, and refusal to eat normally.
 He described her condition as an eating
disorder of the anorexia nervosa type, involving severe weight loss and a
behavioural disturbance
characterised by deliberate attempts to lose weight.  X
had denied that she suffered from one of the common characteristics of
anorexia,
namely a dysfunctional cognition about body weight, shape and eating,
attributing her food refusal to abdominal pain.  Professor
Beumont said that
although this explanation may have been true at first, it is unlikely that
abdominal pain would persist for so
long in the absence of discernible physical
pathology.  He also postulated that X has an obsessive compulsive disorder,
noting that
her poor hygiene could relate an obsessional difficulty.  
<P>

32  	Professor Beumont said that while X was not at immediate
physical risk, a serious physical risk would arise if she were again
to lose a
substantial amount of weight.  If (as he thought likely) X maintained her
weight at a little above 30 kg, she would remain
at risk of chronic medical
complications such as stunting of growth and inadequate reproductive
functioning, and he noted that the
longer an anorexic illness persists, the
more difficult it is for the patient to resume a normal life.  
<P>

33  	In Professor Beumont's view, X's family were concerned and
loving but had an unfortunate attitude to her illness.  He found
them reluctant
to accept its psychological nature, speculating that they may believe that to
do so would imply fault on their part.
 He noted that they were tending,
unfortunately in his view, to consult `alternative practitioners'.  
<P>

34  	Professor Beumont referred to a general consensus about the
proper treatment of anorexia nervosa.  He said that optimally,
X should be
treated by a team experienced in managing this illness, which would usually
consist of `psychiatrist-physician-psychologist-dietitian-family
therapist-nurses'.  In such a regime the parents should be involved as
`co-therapists'.  However that ideal could not be realised
in the present case
because the parents were estranged from the care-givers and saw themselves as
being persecuted.  He therefore
recommended what he called a `gentler
approach', under which X would continue under the care of Dr Williams, with
such assistance
from experts with anorexic patients as Dr Williams thought
appropriate to obtain.  He advised DoCS to liaise in various ways with
Dr
Williams.
<P>

<b>X's treatment by Dr Williams, February to September 1997</b>
<P>

35  	When X was discharged from the Sydney Children's Hospital, both
DoCS and Dr Hughes understood that Dr Williams would take medical
responsibility for her care.  Dr Williams had outlined a specific treatment
regime.  Since at that time there was no child protection
framework in place,
although DoCS had been notified and had taken an interest in X's welfare, the
fundamental responsibility for
the care and treatment of X after her discharge
lay with her parents.  
<P>

36  	The evidence of Dr Williams' treatment of X comprises his report
of 10 March 1999, annexing letters which relate to consultations
on 11 February
1997, 7, 13 and 27 March 1997, 5 May 1997, 1 August 1997 and 12 September 1997.
The reports show that over that period,
X's weight with clothing fluctuated
from 31-35.8 kg.  Several other points emerge from a perusal of Dr Williams'
reports:  X gave
him optimistic reports about her well-being at most of the
consultations, and he appears to have accepted them;  she persistently
refused
to submit to a stool examination and breath test and he recorded that she would
take these tests `when she is ready';  she
told him she was `uncomfortable'
with a dietitian's assessment because it contained too many personal details.

<P>

37  	In spite of her optimistic self-assessments, there was no
significant improvement over the period of Dr Williams' treatment.
 Given the
very tolerant attitude adopted by Dr Williams, one wonders whether his records
of X's weight, in each case with clothing,
are reliable.  Perhaps the most
striking thing about Dr Williams' reports is that the course of treatment which
they reflect seems
to have been a long way short of the course of treatment
which he outlined before X was discharged from the Sydney Children's Hospital.

<P>

38  	While X was under his care, Dr Williams consulted with Dr
Michael Kohn of the New Children's Hospital.  In his report to DoCS
of 28 April
1997, Dr Kohn referred to unsuccessful attempts to admit X to the New
Children's Hospital for the medical management
of her malnutrition and eating
disorder, despite a recommendation which had been made to the family and the
availability of an in-patient
bed.  He made it clear that in his view, she
should be treated as an in-patient, and that she was `at significant risk from
the morbidity
of her malnutrition as well as an increased risk of sudden death
should any metabolic derangement occur.'
<P>

<b>X's condition - October 1997 to December 1998</b>
<P>

39  	The evidence before me contains very little information about
X's state of health during this period.  Dr Williams reported
that on 12
September 1997 her weight was 35.8 kg when lightly dressed.  Various tests,
including a 24 hour urine collection, had
been recommended by Dr Kohn and the
recommendation had been passed on by Dr Williams to X and her parents on 21
August 1997, but
these tests were apparently not carried out.  On 12 September
1997 Dr Williams arranged that X would return for review in six weeks,
but I
infer that this did not occur, since Dr Williams' report of 10 March 1999 makes
no reference to any subsequent consultation.
 
<P>

40  	In his evidence X's father claims that X provided stool samples
for testing in June 1997, and that the results showed that
she had parasite
infestation, for which Dr Williams prescribed some medication.  Evidently both
of X's parents regarded the discovery
of a parasite infestation and its
subsequent cure as vindicating the stand they had taken to date, and as
implying that a physical
cause should have been sought out when eating problems
subsequently recurred.  
<P>

41  	It is difficult to know what to make of their evidence about the
parasite infestation.  X's father says that Dr Williams was
the doctor who
prescribed medication for the parasites, but although his reports referred to
recommendations for stool testing and
his letter of 7 August 1997 stated that X
would `have another stool culture done in the next week for parasites and fat
content',
there is nothing in his reports to confirm that parasites were
discovered.  One would have thought that he would have reported on
so
significant a finding.  In the state of the evidence before me, I am not able
to find that stool tests identified parasites, but
it seems to me that if they
did, that discovery cannot have had the medical significance which X's parents
attribute to it.  Weighing
up all the medical evidence, I cannot conclude that
the presence of parasites would have caused the epigastric pain of which X
complained,
or would have affected the diagnosis made by Drs Rikard-Bell,
Hughes, Beumont and Kohn that X suffered from an eating disorder of
psychological origin.  
<P>

42  	X's father says that a `case closure meeting', to which he was
not invited, was held and subsequently, Dr Williams and he were
in state of
confusion as to what exactly were the continuing requirements of DoCS.  X was
given some counselling but the counselling
sessions were stopped, apparently in
the latter half of 1997.  The family went on an overseas holiday over the
Christmas period 1997/98,
during which time X was limited in what she was
willing to eat, but slowly expanded her food intake.  
<P>

43  	In March 1998 X had braces put on her teeth.  According to her
parents, the pain caused by the braces broke her eating patterns,
and she
slowly began to revert to a very limited food intake and to lose weight.  She
hid her weight loss by wearing loose baggy
clothing.  They say she had
continual nightmares about her hospital experiences and was reluctant to go to
sleep at night, slept
in late in the mornings, and was regularly late for
school.  X's father says `we continued to work very hard with [X] to again
widen
her diet, and to help her overcome her negative experiences in the
hospital'.  This statement is significant because it shows that
while X's
father identified his daughter's eating difficulty, he appears to have excluded
hospital treatment as a possible response.
 He says that he and his wife
believed they had a `breakthrough' with their daughter just before her collapse
in December 1998, as
she had become willing to take protein food and drinks
again and `was declaring that she wanted to choose life'.  Unfortunately the
breakthrough does not seem to have included resumption of an effective regime
for the proper medical treatment of her serious and
life-threatening condition.

<P>

44  	X's parents say that they were looking carefully for signs of
anorexia at this time but did not observe any, as she was energetic
and walked
the dog every night, and wore baggy clothes.  They say they made a mistake by
trying to protect X from hospital treatment
and waiting too long.  
<P>

<b>Admission to Sutherland Hospital on 29 December 1998</b>
<P>

45  	X collapsed in the toilet at home and when she appeared not to
be breathing, her father gave her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
and then took
her to Sutherland hospital by ambulance.  There she was examined by the
paediatric resident, Dr Felix Choi, at 4.45am
on 30 December 1998.  He found
that she was extremely emaciated, her weight being 20 kg.  She was dehydrated,
and had a very low
blood pressure and heart rate.  She was hypothermic at
34&#176; centigrade.  She was given intravenous fluid therapy and subsequently
nasogastric feeding.  Dr Choi said that her collapse was due to dehydration and
severe malnutrition and that she had a very poor
prognosis if not treated in a
specialist tertiary centre such as Westmead.  He said that X's parents resisted
that suggestion and
did not appear to understand how poor their daughter's
condition was.  By 5 January 1999 X herself told Dr Choi that she felt better
and wanted to go home, and clearly did not understand her situation.
<P>

<b>In-patient at New Children's Hospital, Westmead - January to April
1999</b>
<P>

46  	On 8 January 1999 X was transferred to the New Children's
Hospital at Westmead, under the care of Dr Michael Kohn and Dr Kenneth
Nunn.
Dr Kohn, whom I have already mentioned, is a consultant paediatrician
specialising in adolescent medicine.  Dr Nunn is a consultant
child
psychiatrist who is Chair of the Division of Psychological, Developmental and
Rehabilitation Medicine at Westmead.  
<P>

47  	The circumstances of her transfer to the New Children's Hospital
have not been detailed in the evidence in these proceedings,
but one infers
that the transfer occurred with the consent of X's parents, procured only after
substantial pressure was applied to
them.  X's father refers to DoCS presenting
him with a plan for his daughter's treatment, and complains that he was not
consulted
in the formulation of the plan, but was told that unless he and his
wife signed the plan they would be taken to court.  He does not
depose to the
date of this conversation but it could well have been at about the time of the
transfer to Westmead.  
<P>

48  	It is clear that X's admission to the New Children's Hospital
put her parents in a difficult situation because of the sheer
distance of the
hospital from their home, a round trip of about 80 kilometres.  No doubt they
objected to the transfer on that and
other grounds.  At some stage they
expressed a preference for X's admission to Wesley Private Hospital, much
closer to their home,
under the care of Professor Beumont.  
<P>

49  	When she arrived at the New Children's Hospital, X weighed 20.5
kg.  Dr Nunn inspected X shortly after she arrived from Sutherland
Hospital.
He said that in all his years of treating eating disorders, he had never seen a
child where the muscles around the mouth
were directly visible through the
skin, and had never seen in a living body the nerve root canal into the sacrum
at the lower end
of the spine through the skin.
<P>

50  	Dr Kohn and his colleagues treated her with oral and nasogastric
feeding and she gained weight approximately at the rate of
one kilogram each
week.  In his report he said that X's difficulties in eating as well as her
restricted food options (from preferences
and perceived food intolerances)
meant that there was no other option than formula feeding.  By 8 March 1999 her
weight had risen
to 30 kg and it had become possible to liberalise her diet and
exercise plan.  He confirmed that X's malnutrition occurred from dietary
restriction and not as a result of any underlying organic pathology.
<P>

51  	In his report of 8 March 1999 Dr Kohn recorded that X's parents
continued to present difficulties, opposing `management' and
thereby creating
`an environment of confusion that if unchecked would perpetuate [X's] eating
disorder and malnutrition'.  He said
they supported a feeding regime which
would not be able to meet X's nutritional needs, the very situation that had
led to her becoming
so severely emaciated.  He said he was at a loss to
understand the parents' insistence in the face of the obvious detriment to X's
psychological and physical well-being.  He said that X was progressing in a
stable environment with a predictable regime, being treated
by specialist staff
with experience in managing adolescent patients with eating disorders, and
stressed the importance of continuity
and consistency of treatment, as well as
some capacity to `contain the elements introduced by her parents'.
<P>

52  	By mid-April 1999, X was eating some regular food such as fruit
and some vegetables, supplemented by food drinks.  However,
she was continuing
to restrict her food intake despite the hospital offering a choice of
vegetarian foods, because she had concerns
about food allergies.  These were
investigated by an immunologist and a gastroenterologist at the hospital, but
no physical or laboratory
evidence was found to support a food intolerance or
allergy.
<P>

53  	X was treated by Dr Kohn in collaboration with Dr Nunn.  Dr Nunn
has prepared several written reports and also gave oral evidence
in the present
proceedings.  In his report of 8 April 1999 he noted that she was still
seriously underweight and short in stature
for her age.  She was cooperating
with eating but had a restricted diet `with unshakeable convictions about dairy
products'.  Her
mood had improved since her admission but her behaviour in the
presence of her parents was markedly different than throughout the
day during
their absence.  With her parents she became more serious and the focus of their
discussions was on what she was being
fed and her commitment to a vegan diet.
In the absence of her parents she was more lighthearted and participated
willingly in ward
activities.  He said this:
<P>

`Irrespective of intent and motive, the parents generally end up on the side of
discharge rather than admission;  the seeking of
alternative options rather
than the opinion of the current clinicians;  in favour of [X's] restrictive
food practices rather than
a commitment to broaden her food intake;  and
against the wholehearted collaborative approach with professionals that is so
characteristic
with other life-threatening medical illnesses.'
<P>

X's parents amplified relatively trivial concerns in the face of her
life-threatening condition.  Dr Nunn found it difficult to
see how X could
mount any effective challenge against the relentless pressure of her parents'
influence when the efforts of experienced
professionals were repeatedly
thwarted and stymied.  He and the hospital staff had not seen a single instance
where X expressed a
position or opinion independent of her parents.
<P>

54  	Dr Nunn's diagnosis was that X has an atypical eating disorder
with restricted and refusal elements.  He said that approximately
5% of those
with anorexia and its related disorders die each decade of the disease.  In his
view X fell within the group which is
most at risk of perishing.  However, her
condition was remediable if only she could be separated from her family
context.  He expressed
concern that X's carers would gradually be worn down by
family opposition, and noted that death was `an ever-present reality'. He
expressed the fear that if the current treatment arrangements were not
sustained it would be unlikely that anyone would mount such
an effort again,
and it would be necessary to take a merely palliative approach to her care.  He
estimated that X had a 40-60% ten
years survival rate in her parents' care,
while out of their care that risk would drop very substantially.
<P>

55  	Nursing staff encountered difficulties in dealing with X's
parents.  Dr Nunn reported that nursing staff found negotiations
with the
parents to be `laboured' over many issues, both substantial and minor.  He was
contacted by nursing staff who reported that
X's parents had approached another
child in the hospital and told her that she did not have to follow Dr Nunn's
directions and could
pursue alternative treatment on discharge.  The
conversation was overheard by another child in the ward whose parents confirmed
the
substance of it.  
<P>

56  	X and her parents have made a number of specific complaints
about X's treatment at the New Children's Hospital.  The first
and most
shocking relates to some photographs taken of her after her admission.
Essentially their complaint is that the photographs
were taken after X and her
parents had withdrawn their consent and that she was photographed completely
naked by a male photographer
with her hands above her head, notwithstanding
that Dr Kohn had promised her some privacy.
<P>

57  	It is clear that some photographs of X were taken at the New
Children's Hospital.  The evidence includes a photograph of part
of the clothed
body of a person whom I presume to be X, holding a request form for patient
photography on 14 January 1999, which
is endorsed with the words `please note
cover genitals etc on frontal view'.  The plaintiff sought to tender a bundle
of photographs
which were marked for identification and placed in a sealed
envelope.  Counsel for the parents objected to the tender of the photographs
on
the ground that their admission into evidence would unnecessarily distress X,
and I excluded them from evidence.  However, counsel
for the parents admitted
that X was not naked in any of the photographs.  Dr Nunn was cross-examined on
the incident.  He neither
admitted nor denied the allegation that X was naked
when the photographs were taken, saying that he was not there at the time.  He
said, however, that it would be reasonable procedure in such a case for the
patient to be photographed naked, so that her condition
could be accurately and
carefully documented as a basis for the provision of comprehensive care.  He
said that Dr Kohn had made a
concession that she could be photographed wearing
underwear, which he would not have made.  He agreed that in a sense the
photographs
were humiliating but pointed out that such procedures are
inevitable in proper medical treatment.  He did not deny that a female
photographer could have been arranged but said that there was limit to the
number of staff which the hospital has.  
<P>

58  	The evidence includes three letters (or perhaps diary notes)
written by X on 9, 12 and 16 March 1999.  They record X's unhappiness
and
complaints about her treatment, but they make no mention of the photographing
incident.  Also in evidence is a letter to the
Minister who is responsible for
DoCS, evidently written by X after 20 April 1999, when she discharged herself
from the New Children's
Hospital.  In this letter X complains passionately
about her treatment and alleges that she was photographed naked against her
will,
saying that she felt degraded and shamed and was completely humiliated.
If the incident had occurred in January in the way she described
it late in
April, one would expect it to figure prominently in her catalogue of grievances
written in March.  Additionally, when
interviewed by Dr Sheridan at Wesley
Private Hospital on 6 May 1999, in a context where she wished to persuade Dr
Sheridan to accept
her into the hospital, she mentioned another incident but
made no reference to the photographing.<b>  </b>In all the circumstances, I am
very doubtful that she was photographed frontally naked with her hands above
her head.  Additionally,
I am not persuaded by Dr Nunn's evidence that it would
have been medically necessary for frontal naked photographs to have been taken,
in light of Dr Kohn's endorsement on the request form.
<P>

59  	The second incident complained of was that in March 1999, just
before X was to be weighed, a female nurse put her hand inside
X underwear,
from behind, and felt her buttocks.  There is no dispute that this incident
occurred.  However, the plaintiff's evidence,
which I accept, is that such a
procedure is a routine and appropriate procedure to ensure that the anorexic
patient has not concealed
a heavy object on her person which would give an
inaccurately high measurement of weight.  One would hope that the procedure
could
be explained to the patient in order to remove or minimise any sense of
shock or humiliation on the patient's part.  One can understand,
however, that
in X's case nursing staff may have made the judgment that an advance
explanation would be counterproductive.  My conclusion
is that the procedure
did not provide any justifiable ground for complaint.
<P>

60  	Thirdly, there is a complaint against Dr Nunn.  In her letter to
the Minister of April 1999, X complained that he frightened
her, and told her
that he was going to be `horrible' to her and tell the nurses to be mean to
her.  Dr Nunn's evidence is that this
is a caricature of what he said.  He
sought to explain to X that she would find the experience of treatment hard and
may even feel
during the course of it that he as her doctor was nasty to her.
Her parents, seeing her distress, might think likewise.  He told
X that, in
effect, she should temper her expectation that everything will be easy.  He
says that X told him she would not feel like
that, and that she liked him.  I
accept Dr Nunn's evidence and find that the conversation provided no
justifiable basis for complaint.
 
<P>

61  	Another complaint against the New Children's Hospital is that X
was discriminated against, compared with other patients, who
received favours
which she was denied.  However, having regard to the evidence of the extreme
seriousness of X's condition, I find
it not surprising that her treatment
regime was special in that she may not have been allowed liberties enjoyed by
other, less seriously
ill patients.  
<P>

62  	It appears that X was from time to time unhappy and angry about
her treatment at the New Children's Hospital, more or less
as Dr Nunn had
predicted.  It appears from her three letters of March 1999, and from her
letter to the Minister of April 1999, that
a large part of her unhappiness
stemmed from disagreement with the decisions of her doctors and the treatment
they prescribed.  In
one of her letters of March 1999, she refers to a medical
opinion, by a doctor whom she does not identify, that she would not be
able to
get enough nutrition from her limited diet, and continues:  `but that is soooo
not true... I can get enough from the fortified
full soy milk, soy cheese,
tofu, nuts and seeds, soy beans, legumes, rice (brown), cereals, and yeast free
bread.'  Later she says
`he thinks that because it's happened twice that'll
happen again - but the 1st time it was the parasites fault, and the 2nd the
PW's
fault - they gave me an eating disorder...'.  Absent reinforcement from
her parents, one would expect that she would eventually realise
how unwise as
well as pointless it was to back her own medical judgment against the judgments
of the experts.  The evidence of Dr
Kohn and Dr Nunn is that when her parents'
reinforcement was not close at hand, she was much better adjusted to the
treatment regime.
 
<P>

63  	Some time in March 1999 X told her parents that she was
frightened and did not trust the nursing staff and wanted to run away.
 The
parents say they were at that time trying to move X to another hospital, and
that they received permission from Wesley Hospital
to take her there.  They say
that when they informed DoCS of their intentions, DoCS initiated proceedings in
the Children's Court.
 Afterwards X continued to threaten to her parents that
she would run away.  They say they tried to turn her away from the idea of
running away.
<P>

<b>The Children's Court proceedings</b>
<P>

64  	On 15 March 1999 the plaintiff commenced proceedings in the
Children's Court in relation to X, alleging that she is in need
of care within
the meaning of the Children's (Care and Protection) Act 1987 (NSW).  On 17
March 1999 that Court made an order under
s 77(1)(a)(v), pending determination
of those proceedings, that X be placed in the care of the plaintiff.  
<P>

65  	On 19 March 1999 Professor Beumont wrote to X's parents
indicating that he would take over X care at Wesley Private Hospital,
provided
that two conditions were met.  The first was an assurance by Doctors Kohn and
Nunn that X's transfer to Wesley would be
in her best interests.  The second
was for Wesley to offer her a place.  It appears that X's parents do not have
private health cover
for her.  Professor Beumont noted that Wesley takes some
uninsured patients `pro deo' but that would be a matter for the hospital's
chief executive officer.
<P>

66  	On 22 March 1999 Dr Nunn wrote to Professor Beumont pointing out
that X was under the care of the Director General, and that
both he and Dr Kohn
believed that a change of doctor and venue would seriously compromise the
continuity of X's care and the configuration
of services that had been
assembled for her.  Professor Beumont responded on 29 March, saying that the
facilities of the New Children's
Hospital for a patient of X's age and severity
of illness are superior to those which he could offer at Wesley or Royal Prince
Alfred
Hospital (`RPAH').  He said he would be willing to have X transferred to
either Wesley or RPAH under his care, but only after discussion
and
consultation with Doctors Nunn and Kohn and with their agreement.  He pointed
out that RPAH could not admit her unless it obtained
authority from the
Department of Health to take an extra tertiary patient above its agreed load,
and in the case of Wesley the chief
executive would need to consent to a
prolonged admission on a pro deo basis.  He said in his opinion X was better
placed at the New
Children's Hospital than RPAH or Wesley, but had offered his
assistance in the hope that he could broker a resolution of the conflict
between X's parents on the one hand, and DoCS and the doctors at the New
Children's Hospital on the other.  Without pre-empting his
eventual opinion, he
said it was likely that he would recommend that X should stay at the New
Children's Hospital with some modifications
being made to accommodate her
parents' concerns.
<P>

67  	Dr Nunn provided a report for the Children's Court, dated 25
March 1999, in which he opposed a further assessment of X by Professor
Beumont,
on the ground that it would serve to destabilise and undermine the capacity of
DoCS and the New Children's Hospital to maintain
the framework of protection
which they had put in place.
<P>

68  	The proceedings came before the Children's Court for mentions
and interlocutory applications, including an application by X's
parents which
led the Children's Court on 25 March 1999 to grant them leave for Professor
Beumont to assess X.  A pre-hearing conference
was convened for 20 April 1999,
by which time it was hoped that Professor Beumont's assessment would be
available.  However, although
the conference was held, Professor Beumont's
further assessment had not at that stage been made, and has not been made up to
the
present time.  
<P>

69  	After X discharged herself from the New Children's Hospital on
20 April 1999, the Children's Court proceedings were overshadowed
by
proceedings in this Court, and on 17 May 1999 I made an order staying the
proceedings in the Children's Court until further order.
<P>

<b>X `escapes' from the New Children's Hospital - 20 April to 6 May 1999</b>
<P>

70  	X left the hospital on the afternoon or evening of 20 April
1999.  Hospital staff searched the hospital and surrounding area
and contacted
Parramatta Police.  X's parents arrived for their evening visit at around 7pm
and were informed that X was missing.
 They said they did not know where she
was.
<P>

71  	DoCS and the doctors at the New Children's Hospital became very
concerned for her welfare.  Dr Kohn reported that if she were
to stop eating
and drinking, her health would rapidly deteriorate, and if she resumed her
earlier eating habits she would gradually
lose weight, with the risk of bone,
kidney, brain, liver and other organic damage, as well as risks from her mental
condition.  
<P>

72  	The police issued a media release stating that X was missing and
required urgent medical attention.  This was publicised on
radio and television
without response.  X's parents received various anonymous telephone calls
saying that X was fine and was eating
and drinking.  They received a letter
from her in which she said she was eating and drinking `really well' but could
not come home
because she was `too scared of being sent back to Westmead
Children's Hospital'.  They found a letter in her belongings in which
she said
she was running away because she could not cope any more, and that she was
putting weight on at the hospital but `they're
torturing me in my
emotions/psychologically'. 
<P>

73  	On about 30 April 1999 the Director General of DoCS received a
telephone call from the Reverend John Scott, who said he was
telephoning on
behalf of X's parents.  He purported to speak for X and, in effect, endeavoured
to negotiate for X's return to Wesley
Private Hospital, rather than to the New
Children's Hospital, and for discontinuation of the Children's Court
proceedings.  Reverend
Scott also spoke to the police, and sought to reach an
understanding with them that they would not lay charges against the people
involved if X was returned.  Eventually X and a solicitor retained to act for
her arrived at Wesley Private Hospital on the evening
of 5 May 1999. 
<P>

<b>X as an in-patient at the Wesley Private Hospital - 5 to 24 May 1999</b>
<P>

74  	X was interviewed by officers of DoCS at Wesley Private Hospital
on 7 May 1999.  She refused to return to the New Children's
Hospital but said
`things were quite a lot better' at Wesley.  She said she was safe while
missing, but would not indicate where
she had been.
<P>

75  	X was interviewed by Dr Margaret Sheridan, a psychiatrist
working in the eating disorders programme at Wesley Private Hospital.
 Dr
Sheridan could only give a descriptive report but observed that X was
significantly underweight and her case would warrant treatment
in a hospital
unless she was able to gain weight as an outpatient on a steady basis.  In her
report of 10 May 1999 Dr Sheridan explained
that in the absence of Professor
Beumont overseas, she was the only psychiatrist working in the eating disorders
programme at Wesley
Private Hospital, with an exceptionally heavy case load.
She said that in view of limited resources, she was not willing to take
on a
patient with the complexities of X.
<P>

76  	On 11 May 1999 the Chief Executive Officer at Wesley Private
Hospital contacted DoCS to confirm that due to the absence of
Professor Beumont
overseas, and the case load of Dr Sheridan, Wesley was not in a position to
take on a patient whose case had the
complexity of X.  He said the New
Children's Hospital had the expertise and background knowledge of X to provide
a more appropriate
service.  
<P>

<b>The present proceedings</b>
<P>

77  	The proceedings in this Court began when an ex parte application
was made by the plaintiff to me as duty judge on 12 May 1999,
for leave to file
in court a summons seeking an order that X be made a ward of this Court and
that she be moved to the New Children's
Hospital, as well as other orders.  I
made orders for abridgment of service and other ancillary orders, and the
matter returned for
further hearing on 14 May 1999.  
<P>

78  	At that hearing both the defendants, X's parents, and X herself
were represented by counsel.  By consent, they invited me to
make orders,
pending further order, declaring X to be a ward of court under the control of
the plaintiff, staying the Children's
Court proceedings, and adjourning the
proceedings in this Court until 24 May 1999 so that the plaintiff could carry
out an assessment
of the suitability of Bronwyn and Graeme Lougheed to provide
residential care for X.  
<P>

79  	However, the parties could not reach agreement as to where X
should reside until 24 May, what access her parents should have
to her during
that time, and whether I should direct the plaintiff to allow an independent
assessment of X.  I proceeded to an interlocutory
hearing on those matters
until late on the evening of Friday 14 May, reserving my judgment until the
following Monday morning.  On
Monday 17 May I made the orders which the parties
had sought by consent, and declined to make any of the orders which had been
opposed.
 The result was that X remained at Wesley Private Hospital until the
adjourned hearing on 24 May 1999 and her parents had access
to her there, but
there was no further independent medical assessment of her.
<P>

80  	On 24 May 1999 the plaintiff, X's parents (the defendants) and X
were represented by counsel.  X's parents put forward some
alternative
proposals for X's care, advocating that she be placed with either Dr and Mrs
Barratt or Bronwyn and Graeme Lougheed.
 I shall consider these proposals
later.  
<P>

81  	After hearing further evidence and submissions, I made the
following orders in substitution for all orders previously made:
<P>

1.	That the young person X born 21 December 1983 be and remain until further
order a ward of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.
<P>

2.	That pending further order the Director-General of the Department of
Community Services or her delegate be granted custody, care
and control of the
said child.
<P>

3.	That the appointment of KATHRYN RENSHALL, Solicitor, of 249 Bronte Road,
Waverley, New South Wales, as the separate representative
of the said young
person continue until further order.
<P>

4.	That the proceedings commenced by the Director-General pursuant to the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Care and Protection) Act 1987</a></i> in the Children's Court of New
South Wales in respect of the said young person be stayed pending further
order.
<P>

5.	That the said young person reside as an in-patient at the New Children's
Hospital for the purpose of administration of such treatment
as may be
necessary in the opinion of Dr Kenneth Nunn and/or Dr Michael Kohn.
<P>

6.	That leave be granted to the staff of the New Children's Hospital to detain
the said young person at or return her to the hospital
and to use reasonable
force (if necessary) in so detaining or returning her.
<P>

7.	That leave be granted generally to Dr Kenneth Nunn and Dr Michael Kohn to
furnish such treatment and nursing care as is in their
opinion necessary and as
may be appropriate to ensure that the said young person suffers the least
distress and retains the greatest
dignity.
<P>

8.	It is noted that these orders are made as being in the best interests of the
said young person and are exercisable whether or
not she consents thereto.
<P>

9.	That Dr Kenneth Nunn and/or Dr Michael Kohn are directed to provide a
written report to this Honourable Court and to the parties
and the separate
representative on or before 12 July 1999 as to the treatment, progress and
general wellbeing of the said young person.
<P>

10.	(a)	That the Director-General ensure that the staff of the New Children's
Hospital involve the defendants and the separate representative
in all
decisions relating to access between the said young person and her parents, Y
and Z.
<P>

	(b)	In the event that no agreement as to access is reached, it is noted that
it is the intention of the parties and the separate
representative to restore
this matter to the List for further consideration of that issue by this
Honourable Court.
<P>

11.	(a)	That the Director-General be directed to destroy all copies and
negatives of photographs of the said young person currently
in the possession
of staff of the Department of Community Services.
<P>

	(b)	It is noted that the Director-General undertakes to request the staff of
the New Children's Hospital to place all photographs
of the said young person
in a sealed envelope within the hospital file.
<P>

12.	That leave be granted to the separate representatives to provide copies of
all judgments herein to Dr Kenneth Nunn and to inform
him of the concerns
expressed by the said young person as to her readmission to the New Children's
Hospital.
<P>

13.	That it be noted that the Director-General undertakes that she will not
request that any additional photographs of the said
child be taken while she is
an in-patient at the New Children's Hospital.
<P>

14.	That the following undertakings from the staff of the New Children's
Hospital given via Dr Kenneth Nunn be noted:
<P>

(a)	That additional photographs of the said young person will be taken only if
such are considered medically necessary by Dr Kenneth
Nunn and/or Dr Michael
Kohn.
<P>

(b)	If the said young person consents to being weighed while attired only in a
hospital gown, no search of her clothing need be
carried out.
<P>

15.	That it be noted that the Director-General undertakes that she will arrange
for a female photographer to take all further photographs
of the said child
which may be deemed medically necessary by Dr Kenneth Nunn and/or Dr Michael
Kohn.
<P>

16.	(a)	That the Director-General is ordered to arrange a formal case
conference within seven (7) days of the date of these orders
and a case
conference thereafter once every four (4) weeks.
<P>

	(b)	It is noted that the Director-General undertakes to confer by telephone
with the defendants Y and Z every second working day
as to the said young
person's treatment, progress and general wellbeing and that such contact shall
be made with A.M. Cora Ingram.
<P>

17.	It is noted that the defendants, Y and Z, are to be permitted to write one
letter per week to the said young person provided
that all such correspondence
shall be forwarded via A.M. Cora Ingram, with the intention that she shall
check the contents thereof
to ensure that such do not undermine the treatment
program for the said young person.
<P>

18.	The Director-General will use her best endeavours to facilitate reasonable
access to the young person by the separate representative,
and pastoral visits
once a week on Sunday afternoons.
<P>

19.	That no material be published in respect of these proceedings which would
identify the young person.
<P>

20.	The defendants are restrained from discussing with the young person the
evidence given by Dr Nunn by written report or orally
in these proceedings.
<P>

21.	These orders are in substitution for the orders made in these proceedings
on 12, 13, 14 and 17 May 1999, and the Court's orders
made on those days are
dissolved.
<P>

22.	Liberty to the parties and the separate representatives to apply on 24
hours notice to have the matter restored, if possible,
to the List of his
Honour Justice Austin.
<P>

82  	I indicated that I would deliver written reasons for my decision
to make these orders.  The present judgment contains these
reasons.
<P>

<b>Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court</b>
<P>

83  	At the hearing the plaintiff submitted that this Court has
jurisdiction to make the orders which the plaintiff sought.  The
defendants did
not challenge the Court's jurisdiction.  Nevertheless I satisfied myself that I
had the power to make the orders which
I eventually made, and I now set out my
reasons for reaching this conclusion.
<P>

84  	The orders which I made on 17 and 24 May 1999 are in three
categories, relating to wardship and parental access, compulsory
medical
treatment and stay of proceedings.  The remainder of the orders of 24 May 1999
either note various undertakings or are ancillary
to orders in one of the three
categories mentioned.  I shall deal with the Court's power to make orders in
each of these three categories.
<P>

<b>Wardship and parental access</b>
<P>

85  	My orders of 24 May 1999 included an order that X be a ward of
this Court until further order, under the custody, care and
control of the
plaintiff (orders 1 and 2).  The Court's power with respect to wards of court
derives from the historical jurisdiction
of the English Court of Chancery, and
is part of the <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction.  Lord Eldon LC explained the
jurisdiction in <i>Wellesley v Duke of Beaufort </i>(1827) 2 Russ 1, 20 <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1804/233.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1804] EngR 233</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=38%20ER%20236" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[38 ER
236</a>, 243] thus:
<P>

`[I]t belongs to the King, as <i>parens patriae</i> having the care of those
who are not able to take care of themselves, and is founded on the obvious
necessity that the law place
somewhere the care of individuals who cannot take
care of themselves, particularly in cases where it is clear that some care
should
be thrown round them.'  (On appeal, sub nom <i>Wellesley v Wellesley
</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281828%29%202%20Bli%20NS%20124" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1828) 2 Bli NS 124</a>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=4%20ER%201078" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[4 ER 1078]</a>;  see also <i>Re Eve </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1986%5d%202%20SCR%20407" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1986] 2 SCR 407</a>;
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=31%20DLR%20%284th%29%2014" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">31 DLR (4th) 14.)</a>  
<P>

86  	Originally the function of wardship was to protect the property
of a minor, where the parents were dead or unable to protect
it themselves.
However the jurisdiction was expanded from its origin in property to become a
jurisdiction concerned with the protection
and welfare of children more
generally.  The effect of making a child a ward of court is that the custody of
the child, in the widest
sense, rests in the court, which then has wide powers
in relation to the ward to the extent that the court's consent is required
for
all important steps taken in the ward's life:  <i>Re S (an infant) </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%201%20All%20ER%20202" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1967] 1
All ER 202</a>, 209.  The court's power supersedes the rights and powers of the
parents or other guardians (<i>R v Gyngall</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1893%5d%202%20QB%20232" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1893] 2 QB 232</a>, 239) and the
court takes over the ultimate responsibility for the ward, though it grants the
care and control of the ward to a named
person or persons (see N V Lowe &amp; R
A H White, <i>Wards of Court </i>(2nd ed,  1986), 6-9).
<P>

87  	In New South Wales the Court of Chancery's jurisdiction in
wardship was formerly exercised by the Supreme Court in Equity,
and that
jurisdiction was vested by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a> (NSW), <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23</a> in the
present Court, to be exercised as a matter of practice by the Court in the
Equity Division.  This was confirmed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 53</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a>, which
assigned to the Equity Division proceedings which would have been commenced in
the Supreme Court of Equity prior to 1972,
including specifically proceedings
for the wardship of infants <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s53.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 53(3)(j)).</a>  In <i>K v Minister for Youth and
Community Services</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20NSWLR%20311" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1 NSWLR 311</a> it was held that the inherent
<i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction with respect to children was not confined to
wardship, and the Court could make orders about the custody and care of
children without first declaring them to be wards of court.
<P>

88  	The Court's historical jurisdiction has survived the enactment
of New South Wales legislation dealing with the welfare of children.
 In <i>K v
Minister for Youth and Community Service</i> (cited above) Helsham CJ in Eq
held that the court's inherent power to protect the interests of infants,
deriving from the <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction, had not been displaced by
the Child Welfare Act 1939 (NSW).  His Honour said (at 323):
<P>

`In its role as <i>parens patriae </i>[the Court] has always had power to
interfere with the actions of guardians where necessary to protect the welfare
of wards.  This
is, of course, a power not restricted to wards nor arising
because of wardship.  It is a power of the Sovereign to protect persons
who
from their legal disability stand in need of protection... [I]t would seem to
me that good reason would have to be shown why
the Court's jurisdiction over
these children is excluded.'
<P>

89  	The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Care and Protection) Act 1987</a> (NSW), the Act under
which the Children's Court proceedings in the present case were brought,
clearly recognises the inherent jurisdiction
of the Supreme Court.  Thus, while
s 72(1)(c) gives the Children's Court the power to make an order declaring a
child to be a ward,
s 73(4) states that the Children's Court is not to make
such an order if it would be inconsistent with an order made by the Supreme
Court `in the exercise of its jurisdiction with respect to the custody and
guardianship of children'.  Section 88(4) states that
nothing in Part 5 (which
deals with children in need of care) limits the jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court `with respect to the custody
and guardianship of children'.  Section 96
contains an equivalent provision with respect to Part 6 of the Act (which deals
with wards
and protected persons).  In my opinion these statutory references to
the Supreme Court's jurisdiction with respect to the custody
and guardianship
of children identify or include the Court's inherent <i>parens patriae</i>
jurisdiction.
<P>

90  	I turn to consider whether the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act 1975</a> (Cth) is an
obstacle to this Court's exercise of the <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction.
It is clear that under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a> the Family Court and other courts
exercising jurisdiction under that Act have a statutory jurisdiction which is
similar to the <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction of the Supreme Courts of the
States:  <i>Secretary, Department of Health and Community Services v JWB &amp;
SMB (Marion's case)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/15.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] HCA 15</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%20175%20CLR%20218" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 175 CLR 218.</a>  The amendments to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law
Act</a> which gave those courts a general jurisdiction with respect to child
welfare were made by the Family Law Amendment Bill of 1983.
 According to the
Attorney-General's Second Reading Speech, those amendments were intended to
implement the recommendations of the
Watson Committee, which had recommended
that the substance of the wardship jurisdiction be conferred exclusively on
courts exercising
jurisdiction under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a> in relation to children
to whom that Act applies:  Australian Senate Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 1
June 1983, 1098;  Watson
Committee Report (Wardship, Guardianship, Custody,
Access, Change of Name), November 1982, recommendation (2).  
<P>

91  	However, whatever may have been the intention of the Watson
Committee, it appears that the amendments to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a> did not exclude
the Supreme Courts of the States from making orders with respect to wardship
and the custody and care of children.
 For one thing, the statutory powers
vested in courts which exercise jurisdiction under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a> have been
cross-vested to the Supreme Court by the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting)
Acts 1987 (Cth and NSW).  Additionally,
it appears that the inherent <i>parens
patriae</i> jurisdiction of the Supreme Courts of the States has not been
extinguished by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a>.
<P>

92  	The constitutional power of the Commonwealth Parliament to make
laws with respect to the protection or welfare of children
is limited:
<i>Fountain v Alexander</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1982/16.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] HCA 16</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%20150%20CLR%20615" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 150 CLR 615.</a>  However, the Parliaments of
some States including New South Wales have referred certain matters relating to
children to the Parliament
of the Commonwealth so as to augment the
Commonwealth's legislative power under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 51(xxxvii)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>:  see
Commonwealth Powers (Family Law - Children) Act 1986 (NSW).  In the case of New
South Wales, however, the matters referred
to the Commonwealth are expressed
not to include the taking of action which would interfere with a person
acquiring custody and care
of a child under a provision of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Care
and Protection) Act 1987</a> (NSW), or the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to
make orders in respect of children who are in such custody (Commonwealth Powers
(Family Law - Children) Act, s 3(2)(a) and (c)).  
<P>

93  	By <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s69ze.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 69ZE</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/index.html#p7" class="autolink_findacts">Part VII</a> of that Act (which
relates to children) applies to New South Wales only for so long as a law such
as the Commonwealth Powers (Family
Law - Children) Act remains in force;  and
Part VII extends to New South Wales only so far as it makes provision with
respect to
matters referred to it by the State legislation or matters
incidental to the execution of any Commonwealth constitutional power.
 It
follows that, relevantly, Part VII of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a> should not be
construed so as to interfere with orders giving a person custody of a child
under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Care and Protection) Act</a>, or orders made in the exercise of
the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court with respect to children who are in such
custody.
<P>

94  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s69zk.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 69ZK</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a> says (relevantly) that
nothing in that Act affects the jurisdiction of a court under a child welfare
law to make an order by which
a child is placed under the care of a person
under a child welfare law, or the operation of a child welfare law in relation
to a
child.  `Child welfare law' is defined in s 60D to mean a law of a State
prescribed for the purposes of the definition.  Regulation
12B and Schedule 5
prescribe specified provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Care and Protection) Act</a>,
including the sections which authorise the Children's Court to make orders and
interim orders declaring a child to be a ward under
the State legislation (ss
72(1)(c)(ii) and (iii) and 77(1)(a)(v) and (b)(iii)), and also the sections
which expressly preserve the
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court with respect to
the custody and guardianship of children (ss 88(4) and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/s96.html" class="autolink_findacts">96</a>)).  I should note
that there is an argument that the predecessor of s 69ZK, namely old s 60H,
continues to apply to New South Wales
(see R Chisholm and J Dewar,
<i>Butterworths' Australian Family Law</i> (looseleaf), volume I para
[s69ZK.12]), but it is unnecessary for me to determine that question because
the old and new provisions
are not different from one another in any way which
is material to the present case.  
<P>

95  	In my opinion, the result of this complex web of provisions is
that the <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of New South
Wales, including its jurisdiction with respect to wardship and other orders for
custody,
is not affected by the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a>, in a case where the Supreme
Court makes an order in respect of a child who is already in custody under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Care and Protection) Act 1987</a> by virtue of an order of the Children's
Court.  That is the situation in the present case, having regard to the order
of the Children's
Court made on 17 March 1999 under s 77(1)(a)(v).  Indeed, if
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a> purported to affect the Supreme Court's jurisdiction in such
a case, the Act would be unconstitutional to the extent that it relied
for
validity on the referral of power under the Commonwealth Powers (Family Law -
Children) Act, having regard to s 3(2)(c) of the
latter Act.  But the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family
Law Act</a> does not, as a matter of construction, purport to affect the Supreme
Court's jurisdiction in such a case, because of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s69zk.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 69ZK.</a>  
<P>

96  	Indeed, as I read it, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a> does not purport to
affect any part of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court which is preserved by
ss 88(4) and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/s96.html" class="autolink_findacts">96</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Care and Protection) Act</a>.  This means, in my
view, that the whole of the <i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction of the Court
with respect to the wardship, custody and care of children is unaffected by
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/index.html#p7" class="autolink_findacts">Part VII</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a>.  However, since in the present case the Court's
orders relate to a child already in custody by virtue of orders of the
Children's
Court, it is unnecessary for me to decide this point.
<P>

97  	Although I cannot find any detailed consideration of Court's
<i>parens patriae </i>jurisdiction with respect to custody of children after
the enactment of the 1983 amendments to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a>, McLelland J and
Bryson J have both referred to the relevant provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Law Act</a>
and have concluded that the jurisdiction survives, although in the cases before
them the child was a ward by virtue of orders of
the Children's Court:
<i>Director-General Department of Community Services v Australian Broadcasting
Corporation </i>(Supreme Court of New South Wales, No. 2265/96, McLelland J, 4
June 1996, unreported) and <i>Ensby v Director-General Department of Community
Services </i>(Supreme Court of New South Wales, No. 4319/93, Bryson J, 21 April
1994, unreported).  There are other cases in which the wardship
jurisdiction
was invoked by this Court after the 1983 amendments:  <i>B v Director-General

<b>Medical treatment</b>
<P>

98  	The orders which I made on 24 May 1999 include orders
authorising Doctors Nunn and Kohn to furnish such treatment as is in
their
opinion necessary, and authorising the staff of the New Children's Hospital to
detain X there, noting that these powers were
exercisable whether or not X
consents (orders 5, 6, 7 and 8).
<P>

99  	In <i>Marion's case</i>, cited above, the court noted that
contemporary descriptions of the <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction over
children accept that in theory there is no limitation on the jurisdiction.
Hence, in the High Court's view, the
jurisdiction can be used to authorise the
medical sterilisation of a retarded girl, even if the parents cannot consent to
the operation.
<P>

100  	In <i>Re R </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1991%5d%203%20WLR%20592" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1991] 3 WLR 592</a> the English Court of Appeal
held that in the exercise of its wardship jurisdiction the court could override
the decision of the ward
to refuse medical treatment (in that case,
anti-psychotic drugs).  This would be so, the court held, even though the child
were of
sufficient maturity and intelligence to understand the nature and
implications of the proposed treatment - that is, that even if
she had been
`<i>Gillick</i> competent':  <i>Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health
Authority</i> [1986] 1 X 112.
<P>

101  	The use of the court's wardship powers in a case of anorexia
nervosa is well illustrated by <i>Re W </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%203%20WLR%20758" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 3 WLR 758.</a>  There the judge
at first instance found that W had sufficient understanding to make an informed
decision but that he had jurisdiction
to authorise medical treatment without
her consent.  He concluded in view of the medical evidence that he should do
so, and the Court
of Appeal dismissed an appeal from that judgment.  Lord
Donaldson MR pointed out (at 762) that one of the symptoms of anorexia nervosa
is a desire by the sufferer to `be in control' - a desire well illustrated by
X's behaviour - and refusal of treatment is an obvious
way of demonstrating
this.  Hence the need for a power, to be used in an extreme case, to order
medical treatment without consent.
 The first and paramount consideration is
the well-being, welfare and interests of the child.  The child's wishes are
highly relevant
but not conclusive.  As Lord Donaldson MR said (at 770):
<P>

`I regard it as self-evident that this involves giving them the maximum degree
of decision-making which is prudent.  Prudence does
not involve avoiding all
risk, but it does involve avoiding taking risks which, if they eventuate, may
have irreparable consequences
or which are disproportionate to the benefits
which could accrue from taking them.'
<P>

102  	In <i>Re C </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%202%20FLR%20180" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 2 FLR 180</a> it was held that the court had
the power to direct an anorexic patient to remain as a patient at a clinic
until discharged by her
consultant or until further order of the court.  The
court's power included the power to authorise her detention at the clinic with
the use of reasonable force, if necessary.  This case is particularly germane
to the orders which I have made.
<P>

103  	Obviously the Court's power in the inherent jurisdiction to
countermand the wishes of the child is to be exercised sparingly
and with great
caution.  However, as Lord Donaldson MR acknowledges, there may be cases where
it is necessary to do so.  I have carefully
considered the wishes of X as well
as the wishes of her parents, but I have reached the view that this is clearly
such a case.  X's
wishes are affected by her illness, which appears to be
preventing her from understanding the seriousness of her medical condition
and
from taking proper account of the expert medical advice which is available to
her.  The justification for overriding her wishes
is that on the evidence, her
long term health and even her survival are seriously at risk unless steps are
taken to give her the
medical treatment she needs.  For reasons set out below,
the only viable option for provision of medical treatment is in the New
Children's Hospital, to which she must therefore go notwithstanding her
opposition.
<P>

<b>Stay of Children's Court proceedings</b>
<P>

104  	On 17 and 24 May 1999 I ordered, by consent, that the
Children's Court proceedings be stayed pending further order.  The intention
and effect of my order was clear.  By virtue of ss 73(4) and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/s90.html" class="autolink_findacts">90</a>(1)(b)(ii) of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Care and Protection) Act 1987</a> (NSW) my order declaring X to be a
ward of the Court had the effect of overriding any orders of the Children's
Court, and my order
that proceedings in that Court be stayed had the effect of
restraining the parties to the proceedings before me from taking any further
steps in the Children's Court proceedings.  On reflection, I am not sure
whether I was right to order a stay of proceedings rather
than to make orders
restraining the parties from taking further steps in the proceedings (compare
the approach of the Federal Court
where proceedings have been instituted in a
State Court, described by Meagher, Gummow and Lehane, <i>Equity Doctrines and
Remedies </i>(3rd ed, 1992), paragraph [2104]).  But in my view nothing turns
on that, since the purpose and effect of the orders which I made
is clear.
<P>

105  	The plaintiff submitted that it was appropriate for this Court
to intervene rather than leaving the custody and care of X
to be determined by
the Children's Court, because the inherent jurisdiction of this Court is
broader and more flexible than the jurisdiction
of the Children's Court.  That
the Court's inherent jurisdiction is highly flexible cannot be denied.  As
N.V. Lowe and R.A.H. White
(<i>Wards of Court</i>, 2nd ed, 1986) say (at 9):

<P>

`Another notable feature of wardship is that it is not a creature of statute.
This has enabled it to develop and adapt to changing
social conditions and
values.  At the present time the wardship jurisdiction has managed to combine a
high degree of flexibility
with relative lack of formality and ease of access
to the court.  The court is able to exercise wide powers without being hampered
by technical problems which frequently arise from statutory provisions.  Such a
high degree of flexibility has, however, both its
virtues and its dangers so
that, for example, while the court has the power to ensure that technicalities
do not obstruct the welfare
of its wards, at the same time lack of certainty
thereby produced could prejudice their welfare.'
<P>

106  	It does not seem to me that there is any prejudicial lack of
certainty about the arrangements in this case, given that my
orders have placed
X in the care and control of the plaintiff's officers.  The use of the inherent
jurisdiction to sidestep restrictive
legislative provisions can, of course, be
dangerous, since the restrictive provisions would in many cases have been
inserted to provide
important protections.  However, the breadth and
flexibility of the Court's powers in the inherent jurisdiction can be a real
advantage
in a case such as the present.  In particular, in the exercise of its
powers in the inherent jurisdiction, the Court can make orders
overriding the
refusal of the child and her parents, authorising detention with reasonable
force, and limiting the parent's access
to their child.  Although the matter
was not fully developed in the plaintiff's submissions, it seems to me unlikely
that this combination
of results could have been achieved in any simple way
having regard to the statutory provisions which would have applied in the
absence
of this Court's intervention, under ss 20(1) and (2), 72, 77(1) and
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/s1.html" class="autolink_findacts">1</a>(A), <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/s90.html" class="autolink_findacts">90</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/s93.html" class="autolink_findacts">93</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/capa1987250/" class="autolink_findacts">Children (Care and Protection) Act 1987</a> (NSW).  Having
regard to these considerations, I was satisfied that in the special
circumstances of this case, it was appropriate
for the Court to intervene to
establish a regime for X's custody and care which superseded the regime which
would have applied under
orders of the Children's Court.
<P>

<b>Options for X's further treatment</b>
<P>

107  	As at 24 May 1999 there were the following options for X's
further treatment: discharge of X into the care of Dr and Mrs M
M Barratt;
discharge of X into the care of Bronwyn and Graeme Lougheed;  treatment under
the supervision of Professor Beumont and
Dr Sheridan at Wesley Private
Hospital;  treatment under the supervision of Professor Beumont at Royal Prince
Alfred Hospital;  return
to Sydney Children's Hospital (Prince of Wales);
resumption of the health care programme at the New Children's Hospital;  and
discharge
of X into the care of her parents.
<P>

108  	Some of these options can be dismissed quickly.  Dr and Mrs
Barratt were put forward as potential carers by X parents at the
hearing on 24
May 1999.  Dr Barratt is a partner in a private pathology practice, who has
developed a specialised interest in gastroenterology
because one of his 11
children has a severe gastroenterological illness.  Dr and Mrs Barratt live in
a large eight bedroom home on
ten acres overlooking Penrith Lakes, with the
three of his children who remain at home.  Mrs Barratt is a trained
physiotherapist.
 Dr and Mrs Barratt have generously offered to X's parents
that they would provide accommodation to her without cost and manage all
aspects of her rehabilitation, in a loving and supporting environment. 
<P>

109  	In my opinion, the proposal to place X with Dr and Mrs Barratt
must be firmly rejected.  The medical history of X shows that
time and again
there have been medical investigations to establish whether there is any
gastroenterological basis for her condition,
and time and again the specialist
findings have been that X's disorder cannot be explained by any
gastroenterological or other physical
condition.  
<P>

110  	It appears to me from Dr Barratt's letter that if X was placed
in his care, he would treat her on the basis that her problem
was
gastroenterological rather than psychiatric.  His letter recounts that at one
stage his own child's medical condition was assessed
to be psychiatric, with
atypical anorexia features;  but `investigations persisted and she was found to
have two highly pathogenic,
abnormal bowel organisms'.  A course of treatment
based on the hypothesis that X had a similar physical condition would be
successful
only if the hypothesis proved to be true.  The preponderance of
medical evidence is to the contrary.  Treatment based on such a hypothesis,
if
false, would be extremely dangerous and life-threatening for X.  It would be
irresponsible to opt for that treatment, even if
it was administered in
facilities more sophisticated than a rural homestead overlooking Penrith
Lakes.
<P>

111  	Placing X in the care of Bronwyn and Graeme Lougheed was
another proposal developed by her parents.  At the hearing the plaintiff
provided a written placement assessment report of Mr and Mrs Lougheed, prepared
by two of its senior officers.  The assessment report
is a thorough document
which reveals that Mr Lougheed is in his early 40s and Mrs Lougheed is in her
late 20s;  they have been married
for a little over two years and are happily
married;  if X were to live with them it would be necessary for them to move
from their
rented two bedroom home unit into a three bedroom residence;  Mrs
Lougheed is primarily engaged in counselling young women with eating
disorders
but has no counselling qualifications;  she has some qualifications in fitness
training and a diploma of nutrition and
has recently commenced a counselling
course;  Mrs Lougheed developed an eating disorder when 14 from which she
recovered about two
years ago;  Mr and Mrs Lougheed have a strong network of
support through family, friends and fellow Christians;  Mrs Lougheed met
X late
in 1998 and they `clicked' straight away.  The assessing officers conclude that
Mr and Mrs Lougheed are genuine and caring
people but they cannot at present
offer a suitable physical environment for X;   there is a potential for Mrs
Lougheed's roles as
friend and counsellor to become blurred;  neither Mr nor
Mrs Lougheed have had sufficient experience at either parenting or counselling
to undertake the care of X at this stage, but they have the potential to be
good foster carers in the future.  The officers recommend
that Mr and Mrs
Lougheed undertake the foster parents' training course run by their local
community services centre and then apply
to be reassessed.  
<P>

112  	I agree with this assessment.  Mr and Mrs Lougheed may be able
to assist X at some future time, but it would be very risky
from several points
of view to entrust X to their care at this stage.
<P>

113  	Wesley Private Hospital seemed at one stage to be an available
alternative.  However, Dr Sheridan made it clear in her report
of 10 May 1999
that she could not take on X in view of her current patient load.  On 19 May
1999 the operations manager at Wesley
informed DoCS in writing that Wesley
would continue to care for X until midday on 25 May 1999 but that it was
imperative that the
matter be brought to conclusion by that time.  I infer that
Wesley was unwilling for X to remain as an in-patient there for any significant
period after the hearing on 24 May 1999.  Additionally, both the operations
manager and Dr Sheridan, in her further report of 20
May 1999, made it clear
that in their opinion X requires a structured programme which may have to
extend over a number of months
and was at risk and in distress in the absence
of such a programme.  In these circumstances, Wesley Private Hospital was not
an option
for further treatment or care of X after the hearing on 24 May
1999.
<P>

114  	In correspondence in March 1999 Professor Beumont raised the
possibility of treating X at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.  However,
it appears
to me that that is not a real prospect.  Professor Beumont indicated that X
would be an additional patient above the agreed
load the hospital, a distinctly
sub-optimal position given the level of care and attention which she obviously
requires.  Further,
Professor Beumont is not prepared to undertake
responsibility for X unless Doctors Nunn and Kohn consent, and it is plain that
they
will not consent because they strongly believe that transferring X to a
new treatment programme is contrary to her best interests.
<P>

115  	There is no evidence as to whether the Sydney Children's
Hospital (Prince of Wales) would be able to accept X as an in-patient
again,
but even if they were, it appears to me that such a course would be less
desirable than for her to resume her treatment at
the New Children's Hospital.
X and her parents seem to have formed such a strong dislike of both
institutions that nothing would
turn on their attitude.  The Sydney Children's
Hospital would have to build up a new `constellation of care' (to use Dr Nunn's
words)
whereas such a structure is already in place at the New Children's
Hospital.
<P>

116  	This leaves the Court with only two alternatives, namely for X
to resume at the New Children's Hospital or for her to be returned
to her
parents, who would make such  arrangements as they see fit.  The sad truth is
that, although X parents are loving and dedicated
and desperately want their
daughter to recover, during the last four years they have stood squarely in the
path of the medical experts
who have endeavoured to cure her.  It is not as if
they have made mistakes which they now recognise and will avoid in future.  At
the hearing on 24 May 1999 they wanted to send X to a semi-rural home in the
care of a pathologist who appears to be disposed to
the view that her anorexia
is a misdiagnosed bowel organism and if that option was not acceptable to the
Court, they would place
their daughter with well-meaning but inexperienced
foster-carers whose home unit is not large enough to accommodate her.  Their
view
is, it seems, that anything is preferable, however speculative and risky,
to the expert treatment offered at a specialist adolescent
eating disorders
unit at a major hospital.  Their objection to the New Children's Hospital
cannot be put down to a clash of personalities
or some peculiarity about that
hospital.  They have constantly resisted and undermined their daughter's
medical treatment at each
of the three public hospitals in which she has been
an in-patient.  All the indications are that they would develop a similar
attitude
of resistance to any other form of in-patient or institutional
treatment.  One could not be confident that in time, no similar problems
would
emerge with Wesley Private Hospital.
<P>

117  	It remains the case, as it has been for some time, that X's
health and even her survival are seriously at risk.  The expert
medical
opinions of Dr Nunn, Dr Kohn, Dr Sheridan and Professor Beumont, each of which
I accept, is that X is in need of extended
hospitalisation for the
administration of a tightly organised and strict treatment programme involving
re-feeding, physiotherapy,
psychotherapy, and in particular, ongoing
monitoring.  Only an institution large enough to have a specialised unit can
provide adequate
facilities of that kind.  There is simply no other
alternative, on the evidence, to the New Children's Hospital.  At Wesley, X
appeared
to be eating her prescribed menu and yet over a period of more than
two weeks she gained only 200 grams, and I infer from Dr Sheridan's
report of
20 May 1999 that she was sceptical as to whether X was properly following the
programme at Wesley.  Dr Sheridan diagnosed
an obsessive compulsive disorder,
and though a search for laxatives did not discover any, she noted that X spent
long periods of
time in the bathroom.  
<P>

118  	Dr Sheridan's report of 20 May 1999 conveyed a note of urgency,
especially in her conclusion that `her weight is now dropping
and she requires
significant intervention for her obsessionality.  It is imperative that she
does not sit around waiting to be treated
for a lengthy period of time.'  That
is the state of affairs with which the Court was confronted on 24 May 1999.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

119  	Given the strong and uniform evidence of the medical experts,
and the lack of any plausible alternative, I decided on 24 May
1999 that the
only proper course for the Court to take, in the best interests of X, was to
order her to return to the New Children's
Hospital.  The decision would have
been the obvious and inevitable one to make if the only evidence had been the
evidence of the
medical experts.  What made the case excruciatingly difficult
was X and her parents' passionate opposition to the New Children's
Hospital.
In addition to the evidence of her parents to which I have referred, I received
a personal letter from X which was tendered
by her counsel.  In that letter X
graphically restated her opposition to the New Children's Hospital, which she
described as `too
terrifying'.  She implored me not to send her back, and she
told me that she needed to be with her family where she felt loved and
supported, and that she missed them so very much.  She said, `families are
meant to be together'.
<P>

120  	In my opinion X does not understand how serious her own medical
condition is.  And she is wrong about the New Children's Hospital.
 It may be
that not everything which has happened there was handled as sensitively as it
might have been.  But I have found that
her basic complaints are unfounded.  I
accept the plaintiff's evidence that she adjusted reasonably well to the
hospital regime when
distanced from her parents and their influence.
<P>

121  	That being so, I decided on 24 May 1999 that the sensible
course over the ensuing six or seven weeks would be to give the
medical experts
the opportunity to treat X in the conditions which they regard as necessary,
freed from the disruptive influence
of her parents.  Dr Nunn or Dr Kohn will
provide a written report to the Court by 12 July 1999 and in the meantime, any
of the parties
may apply to me if difficulties arise.  The orders which I made
on 24 May seek to protect and reassure X on such matters as the taking
of
additional photographs and the procedure for weighing her.
