OF NEW SOUTH WALES

COMMON LAW DIVISION
<P>

MASTER MALPASS
<P>

THURSDAY 29 JULY 1999
<P>

<u>10612/1999</u>	<u>ALBERT DAVID v IZAZ KHAN</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	These proceedings were commenced by Summons filed on 17 March
1999.  The Summons seeks to challenge a costs assessment on the
basis that "it
is wrong and excessive in fact and law".
<P>

2  	The Court was told that the challenge was limited to matters of
fact and that leave to appeal was being sought pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 208M</a> of the
<u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</u> 1987</a> (the Act).
<P>

3  	The plaintiff appeared in person.  He relied on a short affidavit
sworn by himself (it consisted of three paragraphs).  He volunteered
that it
had been drafted by a solicitor.  He placed no other material before the Court.
In opposing the application, the defendant
relied on an affidavit sworn by
himself.  There was no cross-examination.
<P>

4  	The material relied on by the plaintiff can be described as
parsimonious.  It provides limited assistance as to the relevant
facts.  It
does not address the decision making process of the Costs Assessor.
<P>

5  	The parsimonious material provides limited detail as to relevant
matters.  I shall do my best to give an outline of what took
place leading up
to the determination by the Costs Assessor.
<P>

6  	In 1998, the plaintiff had instructed a solicitor (Mr Lyubicic)
to act for him in court proceedings (fixed for hearing on 3
and 4 December
1998).  The defendant is a barrister.  On 1 December 1998, he was briefed to
appear for the plaintiff in those proceedings.
 He took over at short notice
from other counsel who had suddenly become unavailable.  On the same day, he
forwarded a letter (by
facsimile) to the solicitor disclosing his rate of
charges.  This material came to the attention of the plaintiff shortly
thereafter.
 The defendant proceeded to read the brief and carry out
preparation.
<P>

7  	The proceedings were settled prior to the commencement of the
hearing.  A discussion took place between Mr Lyubicic and the
defendant
concerning the fees to be charged by the defendant.  A compromise was struck
between them (in an amount which was less
than could have been charged under
the disclosed rates).  On 3 December 1998, Mr Lyubicic advised that the
instructions had been
withdrawn.  A Memorandum of Fees was rendered in
accordance with the compromise (in the sum of $3,000.00).  The fees were not
paid.
<P>

8  	The plaintiff applied to this Court for assessment of the costs
by a Costs Assessor.  The application was referred to a Costs
Assessor (Mr
Hattersley).
<P>

9  	A Certificate As To Determination Of Costs was issued on 24
February 1999.
<P>

10  	The Costs Assessor assessed the defendant's fees in the sum of
$3,000.00.  He advised that he was of the opinion that those
fees were fair and
reasonable in all of the circumstances of the matter.
<P>

11  	It is unclear as to what issues were agitated in the costs
assessment.  The Court has before it a letter  dated 24 February
1999 from the
Costs Assessor.  It was the letter that forwarded the Certificate of
Determination to the plaintiff.  It discloses
that the Costs Assessor  had
received a letter from Mr Lyubicic dated 22 February 1999 (together with a
Statutory Declaration made
by him on 22 February 1999).  The contents of the
letter and of the Statutory Declaration are not before the Court.
<P>

12  	The plaintiff has made certain submissions in support of the
Summons.  The submissions lacked evidentiary support.  The thrust
of the
submissions is far from clear.  Generally speaking, it seems to be said that
what took place was done without authority from
the plaintiff.
<P>

13  	I should add that the Court has before it the unchallenged
evidence of the defendant.  The plaintiff's affidavit affords little
assistance
as to what passed between him and his solicitor.  It has been said in effect
that this affidavit is a piece of devious
draftsmanship.  Whatever be the
position, the defendant was entitled to proceed on the basis that the solicitor
had relevant authority.
<P>

14  	If questions of authority and the like were agitated in the
costs assessment, it appears that they were resolved adversely
to the
plaintiff.  If that is the case, it would appear that the Costs Assessor has
reached a determination which was open to him.
<P>

15  	It may be that the Summons in its present form cannot be read as
an application for leave pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 208M</a> of the Act.  If that is the
case, the plaintiff needs an extension of time to bring the application.  For
present purposes, I put
these matters aside as the application can be disposed
of on other grounds.
<P>

16  	The plaintiff bears the onus of demonstrating an entitlement to
relief.  In the case of an application for leave, he must show
that the
interests of justice require that the determination be set aside.
<P>

17  	I am not satisfied that there has been any error on the part of
the Costs Assessor.  I am not satisfied that there is any basis
for disturbing
his determination.  The onus borne by the plaintiff has not been discharged.
Accordingly, the application fails.
<P>

18  	The Summons is dismissed.  The plaintiff is to pay the costs of
the Summons.
