<b>3323/99 - AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS COMMISSION V SEA-LAND
INSURANCE BROKERS PTY LTD &amp; ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>HIS HONOUR:  </b>This is an ex parte application by the
Australian Securities and Investments Commission for interim injunctions in aid
of relief sought
in the summons filed today, being declaratory relief that the
second, third and fourth defendants are effectively running the first
defendant
whilst it is insolvent without them being registered as the de jure directors.
A company search shows that Mr Johnson is
the only director of the company but
that at various periods the second defendant was a director during its
history.
<P>

2   	The first defendant carries on business as an insurance
broker.  The Commonwealth authorities were concerned about its activities
and
it would seem that the first defendant's licence was cancelled.  The first
defendant appealed and the Commonwealth Administrative
Appeals Tribunal allowed
the appeal on condition that neither the second nor third defendant were to be
managers, directors or signatories
to the insurance broking account of the
first defendant. That order was made on 12 January 1998.
<P>

3   	There is evidence to suggest that that order is being
outflanked by the involvement of Mr Johnson and the fourth defendant
Mr
Fitzhenry.
<P>

4   	The material which the plaintiff has collected indicates
that a mystery deposit of almost $300,000 was made into a bank account
styled
Sea-Land Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd No 2 account with the fifth defendant ANZ
Executors and Trustee Co Ltd at its 68 Martin
Place Branch.
<P>

5   	There is evidence to suggest that that money became trust
money and is in fact and in law part of the trust account of the
first
defendant.  However, the second and fourth defendants appear to have control of
the account, the fourth defendant being the
signatory presumably so the
undertaking given to the AAT was not breached.  The evidence suggests,
accordingly, that (1) there are
trust moneys of the first defendant which are
partly held in trust for members of  the public or for insurance companies;
(2)  the
first defendant company may be insolvent if those moneys are
withdrawn; and (3) there have been attempts by the second, third and
fourth
defendants to withdraw them.  Immediate action is thus needed.
<P>

6   	The problem that I have is that the way in which the
Corporations Law is framed a route by which relief can be given does not
clearly expose itself.  Section 1324 permits the plaintiff to obtain an
injunction, but subs (1) is confined to contraventions of
the Corporations Law
and does not extend to breaches of the undertaking to the AAT or problems with
the legislation governing insurance
brokers, or breaches of trust generally.
<P>

7   	Again, the section is limited to the people against whom an
injunction can be given and it is probably right, though I would
certainly not
like to be taken as having so decided, that an injunction cannot be granted
against a bank or other person who hold
funds on behalf of the company.
<P>

8   	Broadly speaking the Law lets people run their own company
without State interference, so the court must be careful not to
permit the
Commission or any other person empowered by s 1324 to interfere beyond the
scope of the section.
<P>

9   	On the other hand, there is quite high authority for the
proposition that the court must construe the section in a broad way
with the
aim of protecting the public in respect of the commercial activities of
corporations (<b>Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd v Bell Resources Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%208%20ACLR%20609" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984)
8 ACLR 609</a>, which I discussed and applied in<b> Mesenberg v Cord Industrial
Recruiters Pty Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2039%20NSWLR%20128" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 39 NSWLR 128</a> at 134 and following).
<P>

10   	The interim relief sought in the notice of motion is that
the third defendant be restrained from causing the company to incur
a debt
within the meaning of s 588G(2) of the Corporations Law.  I do not see a
sufficient prima facie case at this stage that the
third defendant was a de
facto director and so a director within the meaning of s 60 of the Corporations
Law, or that even if she
was that a withdrawal from a trust account was
necessarily incurring a debt within the means of s 588G(2).
<P>

11   	Interim relief is also sought that the defendants be
restrained from dealing with the bank account.  However, I cannot see
that this
is a contravention of the Corporations Law.  It has been put that so long as
there is a proper application for a declaration
or injunction under s 1324(4)
the court is empowered to grant an interim injunction, but I do not consider
that one should endorse
that submission.  It seems to me that unless there is a
prima facie contravention of the Law then the court should be very slow to
make
an interim order.
<P>

12   	However, s 1324(9) provides that in proceedings under s
1324 the court may make an order under s 1323 in respect of the person.
 The
person must be the second or third defendants in this case.  Although I do not
consider there is a prima facie case, there certainly
is some material which,
when added to the material that will be found in due course, may mean that the
court will at the final hearing
make the declarations sought in the summons.
<P>

13   	Accordingly, it seems to me I can make an interim order
under s 1323, and s 1323 permits not only orders against the person
but under s
1323(1)(e) an order prohibiting a bank from paying any of the money.  An order
against the bank is usually far more efficacious
than a personal order against
former company directors who may be so desperate as to risk imprisonment for
contempt.
<P>

14   	Thus, I will make order 3 in the notice of motion.  I will
also order that the fifth defendant up to 9 August 1999 be restrained
from
paying to any person, without the consent of the plaintiff, any of the moneys
in account 8513 76882 in the account styled "ANZ
Trustees - Sea-Land  Insurance
Brokers Pty Ltd".  There must be liberty to any of the defendants to discharge
any of those orders
on twelve hours' notice and the summons may be made
returnable before the Registrar on 9 August at 9.30am.  Costs of today are
reserved.
I also grant leave to file the summons in court.
<P>
