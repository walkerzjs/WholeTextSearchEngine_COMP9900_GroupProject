<b><u>L9/97 - Regina  v  George Alfred McLEOD</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>ON SENTENCE</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>	This is an application brought pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13A</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act 1989</a> (NSW), ["the Act"], by Mr. George Alfred McLeod, ["the
applicant"]. The application seeks to have determined into the form of a
minimum
term and an additional term a sentence of life imprisonment imposed
upon the applicant by Lusher AJ on 3 July 1990. The application
was heard on 5
February instant; the applicant then appearing unrepresented.
<P>

2	The material facts are within a small compass.
<P>

3	On Thursday 20 July 1989, the applicant went to the Surry Hills Police
Station and there informed a police officer that he had
killed on the previous
day a young woman named Heidi Virag; and that he had so killed her by hitting
her over the head with a metal
bar. Immediate police investigations ensued, and
they resulted in the applicant's being charged with the murder of Miss Virag.
The
applicant first appeared in custody on that charge on 20 July 1989, and he
has remained in custody ever since that day. In due course,
and on 20 June
1990, the applicant was indicted before Lusher AJ and in connection with the
alleged murder of Miss Virag. The applicant
pleaded that he was not guilty, and
he was put, accordingly, upon his trial. The trial continued until 25 June
1990, on which day
the jury, after a retirement of about 2 hours, returned a
verdict of guilty of murder. In due course, and on 3 July 1990, the applicant
stood for sentence before Lusher AJ; and he was thereupon sentenced to penal
servitude for life, that sentence to date from 20 July
1989. A subsequent
appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was dismissed; but the appeal concerned
only matters going to the applicant's
conviction, and not to his sentence; and
nothing turns for present purposes upon the decision of the Court of Criminal
Appeal.
<P>

4	The essential facts surrounding the killing appear, sufficiently for present
purposes, from the following extract taken from a
recorded interview between
the applicant and investigating police, which interview commenced at 9.25 a.m.
on 20 July 1989, being
a time within an hour or so after the applicant had
first reported the killing to the police:
<P>

		"Q.	What can you tell me about the injuries Heidi received?
<P>

	A.	About midday yesterday, she came over to my room, she knew it was my
pension day, so we had sex and after that she put it on
me for one hundred
dollars, I just went berserk and that was it.
<P>

	Q.	What do you mean you went beserk?
<P>

	A.	I got real angry and I picked up the iron bar which is kept near my bed and
hit her.
<P>

	Q.	How many times did you hit her?
<P>

	A.	I can't remember but it was more than once.
<P>

	Q.	Did you hit her with the iron bar?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.	On what part of her body did you hit her?
<P>

	A.	On the head.
<P>

	Q.	Why do you keep the iron bar next to your bed?
<P>

	A.	I had a couple of attempts of breaking into my room and kept it for self
protection.
<P>

	Q.	Why did you hit Heidi with the iron bar?
<P>

	A.	Because she asked me for money.
<P>

	Q.	Had she asked you for money in the past?
<P>

	A.	Never.
<P>

	Q.	Do you know why she wanted the money?
<P>

	A.	Yeah, for sex.
<P>

	Q.	Did she ask you for the money before or after you had sex with her?
<P>

	A.	After.
<P>

	Q.	Where was she when you hit her with the iron bar?
<P>

	A.	Sitting on the bed.
<P>

	Q.	How long after having sex with her did she ask you for the money?
<P>

	A.	Straight away, she never even put her clothes back on.
<P>

	Q.	About what time was it when you hit her with the iron bar?
<P>

	A.	About fifteen minutes after she came in.
<P>

	Q.	Apart from asking you for money, did Heidi do anything else that provoked
you?
<P>

	A.	No, I don't think so.
<P>

	Q.	Did you have an argument with her about the money she asked for?
<P>

	A.	We argued a little and I told her that she hadn't asked me for money before
and I called her every name under the sun and after
that I hit her.
<P>

	Q.	Did you assault her with your hands?
<P>

	A.	No just the iron bar."
<P>

5	At the trial before Lusher AJ the defence raised provocation as an issue
proper to be considered by the jury. Lusher AJ was persuaded
to leave the issue
of provocation to the jury. The verdict of the jury necessarily entails that
the jury rejected the defence contentions
as to provocation.
<P>

6	In addition to the issue  of provocation, the issue of the applicant's
alleged intoxication, in the relevant legal sense, was
raised as a matter of
substance at the trial before Lusher AJ. This issue, also, Lusher AJ left to
the jury. The verdict of the jury
necessarily entails that the jury rejected
the substance of the defence contentions on this issue. 
<P>

7	Lusher AJ, in his Honour's remarks on sentence, described the killing as "a
particularly brutal murder". I would say, with respect,
that my own view of the
objective gravity of the killing is to the same effect. On the view of the
facts most favourable to the applicant,
he was asked unexpectedly to pay for a
sexual encounter with a young woman with whom he had previously been carrying
on for some
time a clandestine sexual affair; and he was so enraged by the
request and by what he saw as its effrontery and unreasonableness,
that he
simply picked up an iron bar and struck the young woman a series of blows that
undoubtedly inflicted upon her fatal injuries.
The evidence at trial was to the
effect that the iron bar must have been wielded with, at least, a significant
degree of force in
order to have caused the particular injuries that were found
upon post-mortem examination of the victim.
<P>

8	In applying <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13A</a> of the Act to the applicant's case, it is necessary
to have particular regard to sub-sections (4A), (9) and (10A) of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sa1989121/s13a.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 13A.</a> I
shall deal in turn with each of those sub-sections.
<P>

	<b>Sub-section 4(A)</b>
<P>

The sub-section is in the following terms:
<P>

	"In considering such an application, the Supreme Court is to have regard to
all the circumstances surrounding the offence for which
the life sentence was
imposed, and all offences, wherever committed, of which the person has been
convicted at any time (so far as
this information is reasonably available to
the Supreme Court )."
<P>

9	The applicant, when he stood for sentence before Lusher AJ, had a not
inconsiderable criminal history. That history comprised
eleven particular
items, and some of the items involved multiple offences. Five of the itemised
matters dealt with offences of breaking,
entering and stealing; a further three
items involved charges of stealing; one item involved a minor offence of
dishonesty; one item
involved proceedings in respect of a breach of
recognisance; and the remaining item, by far the most serious, involved an
offence
of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm, a matter
in respect of which the applicant was sentenced to a substantial
period of
imprisonment.
<P>

10	In connection with these criminal antecedents of the applicant, Lusher AJ
said, in his Honour's remarks on sentence:
<P>

	"For completion, it will be noted that on this question of culpability and
mitigation, I have had no regard whatever to the criminal
record of the
prisoner, which included, as I have stated earlier, a daylight street shooting
on his wife some years ago and for which
he was appropriately punished.
<P>

	It may be argued that one of the circumstances of the incident to be
considered when looking at whether or not there are mitigating
circumstances is
the type or disposition of the person whose culpability is being considered. Be
that as it may, however, as I have
said, I have not taken his record into
account whatsoever and it has not entered into my considerations. I intimated
as much to both
counsel when they addressed on sentence."
<P>

11	Sub-section (4A) does not enable this Court to adopt Lusher AJ's approach
with regard to the applicant's criminal antecedents.
It is necessary,
therefore, to consider more particularly the evidence that is before the Court
as to those criminal antecedents.
<P>

12	As matters stand, there is no evidence touching upon the substance of any of
the matters in the applicant's criminal antecedents,
save only the offence of
malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. As to that
particular matter, there is a considerable
body of evidence: it will be found
in documents forming annexures B, C, D, E and F to the statement of facts that
forms exhibit A
on the present application.
<P>

13	It appears from that material that the applicant met, in the early part of
1970, a lady named Judith Ann Speed. She was then
the mother, and the sole
carer, of two young children. She and the applicant began a de facto
relationship. In due course a baby
boy was born to them. Immediately after the
birth, and without reference to, or knowledge on the part of, the applicant,
Miss Speed
put the child up for adoption, and the child was in fact adopted
out. Shortly thereafter the applicant discovered what had happened;
and he and
Miss Speed contracted what they both described as a marriage of convenience, in
the hope that by so doing, they would
be able to reverse the adoption of their
child and recover custody of the child for themselves. In the events which
happened, it
was not possible to achieve this reversal of the adoption process.

<P>

14	Thereafter, and until about March 1972, the applicant and his then wife
continued in a fairly stormy, volatile, marital relationship.
Early in 1972,
Mrs. McCleod, being then aware that she was again pregnant to the applicant,
procured without prior reference to,
or any prior knowledge on the part of, the
applicant, an abortion; and she underwent, in conjunction with the abortion,
surgical
procedures designed to ensure that she would not again become
pregnant. 
<P>

15	The applicant and his then wife did not thereafter live together. For some
time thereafter the applicant himself was in prison
serving sentences dating
from 2 March 1972 and entailing, put simply, his incarceration until about
March 1973.
<P>

16	On 10 September 1974 the applicant accosted Mrs. McCleod outside the
apartment building in which she was then living. He told
her that he had come
for the purpose of shooting her. He produced thereupon a sawn-off shotgun  and
fired a number of shots into
her. She was not killed, but she was very severely
injured. This appalling crime was committed in broad daylight; and was, even on
the applicant's own contemporaneous version of events, a premeditated and
carefully planned crime.
<P>

17	The applicant took part in a recorded interview with investigating police;
and during the course of that interview he was asked
the following questions
and gave the following answers:
<P>

	"Q35.	Can you tell us why you fired the shots at your wife?
<P>

	A.	Over both children.
<P>

	Q.36	Do you hate your wife?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.37	Do you feel that she has deprived you of the children?
<P>

	A.	Yes.
<P>

	Q.38	When you were told by your mother-in-law about your wife not having the
child. Did that set off a chain of events in your
mind?
<P>

	A.	Yes about the second child.
<P>

	Q.39	Did you formulate any plan?
<P>

	A.	Yes to shoot her in the leg, but I was too drunk, I got drunk waiting for
her to come out so I just fired haphazardly.
<P>

	Q.40	We have been informed by your wife that after she was shot in the mouth
she fell and that she was then shot in the rear part
of her body. Can you tell
us anything about this?
<P>

	A.	Well it just happened so quick. I shot her and then ran."
<P>

18	In respect of this crime, the applicant stood for sentence in the District
Court at Sydney on 16 December 1974. He was then sentenced
to penal servitude
for 12 years; and a non-parole period  was fixed so as to expire on 16 February
1978.
<P>

19	In fact, the applicant was not released to parole until 1 June 1982. It is
clear from the material constituting Exhibit D on
the present application, that
the reason why the applicant was not released to parole at the expiration of
the non-parole period
fixed by the sentencing Court, was a view held by the
Parole Board that his history and previous record "........ together with the
attitudes towards rehabilitation he has shown during current sentence
........." made it appear "...........unlikely that he would
comply with the
conditions of a Parole Order". When the applicant was eventually released, he
was given the benefit of some slight
remissions of sentence. The superintendent
of the facility in which the applicant was last detained before release, made,
in connection
with the release of the applicant, a brief report dated 13 March
1982. Parts of it are, I think, of some importance for present purposes.
The
report reads as follows:
<P>

	"McLeod was transferred to Oberon on the 5.4.78, serving a sentence of 12
years, during the full period of this time he has been
employed in the Laundry,
where he has carried out his work in an excellent manner, he is employed and
paid on a five day per week
basis, but has always worked seven days, and has
done this without any supervision, when he completes his work in the laundry he
always finds himself something else to do in the flower gardens or lawns, he
can be relied upon to collect all dirty linen and issue
clean linen for the
other inmates. Although this man is a very erotic type of person, and it is
considered by other people that he
could be of some danger when released, I
believe that I must be guided by his attitude and conduct whilst at this
institution and
recommend that he be granted 28 Days Special Remission, making
him due for release on the 1stJune 1982."
<P>

20	Given the background of which I have been speaking, it is, in my opinion,
important to take care in applying sub-section (4A).
It is clear that the Court
is to have regard, for present purposes, to those antecedent offences in so far
as credible information
about them is available to the Court. What is not clear
is the way in which Parliament intends that the Court should "have regard
to"
those antecedent matters. That being so, and in the absence of some clear and
imperative statutory requirement to the contrary,
I consider that sub-section
(4A) should not be construed and applied in any way that runs counter to the
fundamental principles of
sentencing that are expounded by the High Court of
Australia in <b>Veen v The Queen (No. 2) </b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1988%20164%20CLR%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1988 (164 CLR 465).</a> It is
sufficient for present purposes to note the principles in the terms of their
summary in the headnote, which is to the following
effect:
<P>

	"(1)	A sentence should not be increased beyond what is proportionate to the
crime to extend the period of protection of society
from the risk of recidivism
by the offender, but it is permissible for the sentencing discretion to be
exercised having regard, amongst
other matters, to the protection of society.

<P>

	(2)	The previous criminal history of an offender may be taken into account in
determining a sentence, but it cannot be given such
weight as to lead to a
penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence. The history is
relevant to show whether the
offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or
whether in it the offender has manifested a continuing attitude of disobedience
of the
law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of
society may indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted.
It is legitimate
to take account of the previous history when it illuminates the moral
culpability of the offender in the instant
case or shows his dangerous
propensity or a need to impose condign punishment to deter him and other
offenders from committing similar
offences."
<P>

21	In applying to the present case the requirements of sub-section (4A) as
conditioned by the <b>Veen </b> principles, it is necessary to keep carefully
in mind that it would be an egregious denial of justice to the applicant to
treat him
now in a way that entailed, effectively, punishing him further for
the 1974 offence. The applicant has paid in full the penalty that
a just
application of the law required him to pay in respect of that earlier
offence.
<P>

22	That said, it remains the case, in my opinion, that the 1974 and 1989
offences, although by no means identical, have certain
circumstantial
similarities that are, in my opinion, troubling.
<P>

23	It is true that the 1974 shooting appears to have been a more coldly
calculated crime than the 1989 killing. It is, nevertheless,
the case that both
offences proceeded from an episode of irrepressible, violent rage triggered by
a perception on the part of the
applicant that he had been affrontingly
mistreated by somebody with whom he had an established and intimate emotional
and sexual
relationship.
<P>

24	It is true, further, that the applicant appears to have been law-abiding
between the date of his release in 1982 and the date
of the killing in 1989.
There is, of course, a sense in which that fact stands to the applicant's
credit. It is, however, the case
that, even after a period of some 7 years of
law-abiding life in the general community, the underlying disposition of the
applicant
was still so fragile and so volatile as to be capable of being
triggered by a sordid but not obviously significant incident into
an outburst
of, literally, murderous rage.
<P>

25	I do not think that it could be contended reasonably that the case of the
applicant is identical with that of Mr. Veen. I think,
however, that there are
some broad similarities; and that they indicate that sub-section (4A),
correctly construed and fairly applied,
require that, if the present
application is to be granted, then the aggregate sentence fixed by the Court
should be a substantial
one. The subsequent need to apportion such a sentence
as between a minimum term and an additional term raises other considerations
with which it will be convenient to deal later in this judgment.
<P>

	<b>Sub-section (9)</b>
<P>

26	The sub-section is in the following terms:
<P>

	"(9)	The Supreme Court, in exercising its functions under this section, is to
have regard to:
<P>

	(a)	The knowledge of the original sentencing Court that a person sentenced to
imprisonment for life was eligible to be released
on licence under section 463
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a> and of the practice relating to the issue of such
licences; and
<P>

	(b)	Any report on the person made by the Review Council and any other relevant
reports prepared after sentence (including, for
example, reports on the
person's rehabilitation), being in either case reports made available to the
Supreme Court; and
<P>

	(c)	The need to preserve the safety of the community; and
<P>

	(d)	The age of the person (at the time the person committed the offence and
also at the time the Supreme Court deals with the application),

<P>

	and may have regard to any other relevant matter."
<P>

27	<b>As to (a)</b>, it is not possible for this Court to say much that is
useful. I think that it can be accepted readily enough that the present
applicant
would have been considered, under the old regime, for release on
licence after he had served some significant period of imprisonment.
How long
he would have been required to serve before being so considered for release on
licence, it is not possible for this Court
to say. The available statistical
base is narrow, and the cases embraced by it cover a very wide range of
individual circumstances
and periods of imprisonment actually served. I think
that it is probable that the present applicant, given his criminal antecedents
as I have previously canvassed them, would have been required to serve a
comparatively longer, rather than a comparatively shorter,
period of
imprisonment before being considered for release on licence.
<P>

28	<b>As to (b)</b>, it is convenient to begin by citing the following
conclusions reached by the Review Council in its report dated 13 November
1997:
<P>

	"Throughout the whole term of his current imprisonment McLEOD has not been a
management problem. Of concern however is his refusal
to accept the seriousness
of his alcohol problem and his consequent reluctance to accept assistance to
deal with it. The SORC will
continue to monitor his progress in prison and will
encourage him to utilise the services provided by inmate development staff.
<P>

	Should McLEOD'S life sentence be re-determined, the SORC will arrange the
preparation of a Management Plan, designed to equip him
for eventual return
into the community as a law abiding citizen.
<P>

	It is appreciated, of course, that his age and medical disabilities will
reduce the range of options available, however the SORC
will work in close
co-operation with the Parole Service to ensure the inmate's needs are
appropriately met."
<P>

29	The proposition that the applicant has not been a management problem, while
literally correct, gives a very incomplete picture
of his progress in fact
during the years throughout which he has been imprisoned. Throughout the whole
of that time, the applicant
has made serious, substantial and consistent
attempts to rehabilitate himself and to equip himself to re-enter the general
community
as a law-abiding and useful citizen. His prison reports have been
consistently favourable. He has no prison demerits of any kind
recorded against
him, something which in my opinion tells very strongly in favour of his present
application. He has completed a
large number of courses designed to improve and
to develop in various ways his natural skills and capacities. Included among
the
materials that have been placed before the Court in that latter regard, is
a certificate given on 13 August 1997 by the head supervisor
of International
Cable Manufactures Pty Ltd. It reads, formal parts omitted, as follows:
<P>

	"............ (the applicant) commenced employment at International Cable
Manufactures on 19-7-1996 up to the present day he has
always worked
diligently, efficiently, conscientiously, he has never refused to do anything
that he has been asked. (The applicant)
has the unique title of any person,
civilian or prisoner, of never taken a `sickie' since the day he started
working here. In the
quality control department, he is regarded as a whiz. I
have never had any complaint against him. I will be very sorry if I ever
lose
him. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to anyone."
<P>

30	This type of endorsement is representative of the way in which the
applicant's work supervisors have consistently evaluated his
capacity,
diligence and reliability.
<P>

31	The expressed concern of the Review Council concerning the applicant's
"alcohol problem" causes me some difficulty. This particular
aspect of the
application was the subject of some evidence given at the hearing by Mr. M. K.
Saxby, the Secretary of two Review Council
sub-committees having to do with the
management of high security inmates and with the management and supervision of
pre-release leave.
I raised with Mr. Saxby the question of the applicant's
supposed "alcohol problem", and Mr. Saxby gave the following particular
evidence.
<P>

	"Q.	The notion that he has refused to accept the seriousness of his alcohol
problem raises, could I suggest for your comment, if
you can make any useful
comment, a number of questions. First is the proposition of fact that he does
still now have an alcohol problem.
Can you point me in the direction of
something that warrants that conclusion of fact? I can understand readily a
conclusion that
he had in the past an alcohol problem. From what little of this
material I have looked at in any detail thus far, I couldn't quite
get a grip
of anything that was suggestive of the fact that he still has a serious alcohol
problem, indeed, an alcohol problem at
all.
<P>

	A.	I can only point you to Helen Hayward's report from 1997 where there is a
discussion of Mr. McLeod's alcohol use and he has
stated he has not touched a
drink whilst in gaol. He asserts he has no desire to drink and questions the
assertion by drug and alcohol
workers that he is an alcoholic. I am not in a
position to be able to say that Mr. McLeod does have an alcohol problem but I
think
if he were to avail himself of alcohol and other drug services then some
kind of opinion could be gathered from them.
<P>

	Q. But is the Council to be understood as saying that it's present view is
that if Mr. McLeod for reasons that seem good to him
does not want to become
involved with drug and alcohol counsellors and psychiatrists and so forth that
the Council will see that
as something mitigating against his fitness to be
released back into the general community, is that the inference I am asked to
draw
from that portion of the report?
<P>

	A.	Yes, it is. The Council relies on the opinion of expert psychologists and
alcohol and other drug workers and given the nature
of the circumstances of the
crime, there was a great deal of alcohol consumed on the day, they would need
to have some indication
of his feelings about alcohol now and some opinion
about whether he is likely to take that behaviour up again if he was released
into the community so they would be very concerned without having any
professional advice and that's what I think they mean there.
They are voicing
their concern. A professional opinion has not been able to be formed about his
ability to cope in the community
without alcohol.
<P>

	THOMPSON:	Without alcohol counselling.
<P>

	HIS HONOUR:	Yes, without alcohol counselling. I understand."
<P>

32	The 1997 report of which Mr. Saxby makes mention is annexure G to Exhibit B.
It contains the following clinical observations:
<P>

	"While Mr. McLeod reports a high dependence on alcohol in the community, he
asserts that he has not "touched a drink" while in
gaol. He further asserts
that he has no desire to drink and questions the assertion by Drug and Alcohol
workers that he is an alcoholic.
However, he does agree that his previous
alcohol usage may have contributed to his current memory, attention and
concentration deficits.
Consultant Psychologist W. John Taylor, in an
assessment dated 1.11.89, reports low performances in specific sub-tests of the
Wechsler
Adult Intelligence Scale which are sensitive to brain damage, which
may be related to Mr. McLeod's chronic alcoholism. Further, results
from the
clinical syndrome scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
reveal a significant elevation of the alcohol
dependence scale. Personality
tests results indicate that Mr. McLeod has a personality disorder with
schizotypal characteristics.
This would/may account for some transient
psychotic symptoms with accompanying perceptual experiences and impairment of
self control
which may explain the feeling of foreboding Mr. McLeod reported on
the day of the assault on Ms. Virag in 1989. However, there is
no evidence or
report by Mr. McLeod of any such psychotic or aberrant perceptual experiences
in the recent past and he reports coping
well in his current environment. Mr.
McLeod does report some social isolation in JCC, however does have "some
friends who I trust".
<P>

33	The clinical observations are followed by this summary:
<P>

	"Mr. McLeod has been in JCC for approximately 12 months. On his own report, he
is coping well and enjoying his work and leisure
activities. It is anticipated
that Mr. McLeod will participate in a therapeutic group to address his alcohol
dependence and he has
expressed willingness to do so. Such a therapeutic
environment would also provide a forum to address Mr. McLeod's limited
understanding
of his offending behaviour."
<P>

34	(The reference to "JCC" is a reference to the Junee Correctional Centre.)
<P>

35	Having both seen and heard from the applicant during the course of the
recent hearing, I think that a fair assessment of his
present disposition is
that he would acknowledge fairly readily having had an excessive recourse to
alcohol at various times during
his past life. In that sense, I think that the
applicant would agree readily enough that he had in the past "an alcohol
problem".
But the relevant present question, surely, is not whether he has had
an alcohol problem in the past but whether he has one now. As
to that, I can
but say that on the whole of the evidence available to me, I would not see any
basis upon which I could reasonably
find as a fact that the applicant does now
have "an alcohol problem".
<P>

36	That said, I would think that it is obviously in the applicant's own present
interests that he cooperate with the Correctional
authorities at least to the
extent of making proper contact with the alcohol counselling service available
to him in his present
custody. I think that it would be very much in the
applicant's present interests to engage, not in any profound psychological
examination
and assessment, but in a simple and sensible programme of advice
and encouragement designed to ensure that if and when he is released
back into
the general community, he will adhere to his declared intention of not again
developing "an alcohol problem".
<P>

37	<b>As to (c)</b>, I consider that this is a matter calling, self-evidently,
for the careful consideration of this Court. The question is, of course,
one of
balance, having regard to the totality of the available evidence. Certainly,
the fixing of any aggregate determinate sentence,
and its subsequent
apportionment between minimum and additional terms, will need to have carefully
in mind the imperative need to
protect the community against any further
incident of violence at all, let alone violence of the kind manifested in 1974
and in 1989.
<P>

38	<b>As to (d)</b>, the applicant was born on 1 July 1939. On 19 July 1989,
the date of the relevant killing, he was aged slightly more than 50 years.
He
is now aged, in broad terms 59-1/2 years. 
<P>

39	<b>As to "any other relevant matter"</b>, there are, in my opinion, a number
of matters to be noticed.
<P>

40	<i>First</i>, it is to be observed that the applicant has a clear and
repeatedly expressed aversion to professional psychologists and psychiatrists.
This aversion, as best I can judge from the available evidence, derives from
the applicant's perception that the psychiatric assessments
that were put
before the Court at trial and sentence did not do justice to his true position.
The applicant has a profound and abiding
sense of grievance about what he sees
as having been egregious inadequacies in his professional representation at
trial and on sentence.
The applicant has a continuing sense of indignation,
even of affront, about what he perceives as persistent attempts by people to
make him admit to the existence of problems that he does not see as existing.

<P>

41	I have approached the determination of the present matter upon the basis
that it is pointless to suppose that the applicant is
going to undergo some
Pauline conversion in connection with these deeply rooted perceptions. All that
can be done, I think, is to
note the facts as they appear from the evidence;
and to factor in to present considerations the need for somebody concerned with
the management of the applicant to find some way of offering the applicant a
prudently sympathetic opportunity to have appropriate
pre-release counselling
designed to minimise any post-release risks of the recurrence of past personal
problems.
<P>

42	<i>Secondly</i>, I have regard to the evidence concerning the applicant's
health. The applicant is diabetic, although he is not at present
insulin-dependent.
He has cardio-vascular problems which, - so far as I can
judge from the available evidence such as it is, - are even now not
insignificant,
and might well call for surgery in the near future.
<P>

43	<i>Thirdly</i>, and related to the present and likely future condition of
the applicant's health, is the fact, - and I am satisfied that it is the
fact,
- that the applicant has responded to his health problems by devising, and by
adhering strictly to, a programme of diet and
of exercise designed to ensure
that his general physical condition is kept under some proper control. The
evidence is sparse, but
it suggests that the applicant's diet and exercise
programmes are in fact keeping him in reasonable general health. To the extent
that such is the case, the fact reflects, I consider, very favourably on the
applicant's present capacity, given only the requisite
motivation, for
intelligent self-discipline.
<P>

	<b>Sub-Section (10A)</b>
<P>

44	The sub-section provides:
<P>

	"The Supreme Court, in exercising its functions under this section:
<P>

	(a)	Must have regard to and give substantial weight to any relevant
recommendations, observations, and comments made by the original
sentencing
Court when imposing the sentence concerned, and 
<P>

	(b)	Must give consideration to adopting or giving effect to their substance
and the intention of the original sentencing Court
when making them, and 
<P>

	(c)	Must, to the extent that it declines to adopt or give effect to those
matters, state its reasons for doing so."
<P>

45	I have read and considered the entirety of Lusher AJ's remarks on sentence.
There do not seem to me to have been any relevant
recommendations. There were
certainly relevant observations and comments made by his Honour; and they were
to the effect, put briefly,
that his Honour did not accept the applicant as a
witness of credit in respect of matters crucial to the determination, which it
fell to his Honour to make, concerning the existence of any circumstances
appropriate to mitigate the sentence, otherwise mandatory,
of imprisonment for
life.
<P>

46	Accepting, as I think I must do, that Lusher AJ's findings in that respect
were plainly open to his Honour; I do not think that
it follows that this Court
must now deal with the applicant upon the basis that what he now says cannot be
safely relied upon.
<P>

47	I think that the applicant is intelligent and resourceful. I think that he
is articulate and confident in his own opinions about
the material aspects of
his present situation. It is clear from the evidence that the applicant has had
a sad and deprived upbringing,
and a disadvantaged adult life that has
prevented his making a good and useful life out of his personal qualities of
intelligence
and resourcefulness. I think that the evidence discloses that he
has made real efforts, and with substantial success, towards his
ultimate
rehabilitation. I think that he is conscious of the moral and legal culpability
of what he did, both in 1974 and in 1989.
I do not think that it makes sense to
deal with the applicant upon the basis that there do not remain any
circumstances in which
an affront of sufficient perceived gravity would draw
from him a very sharp response; but I do not think it fair to infer that his
present disposition is such that any response of that kind would necessarily be
violent, let alone murderously violent as in 1974
and 1989.
<P>

48	Thus, although I do not see any basis upon which I could differ from Lusher
AJ's findings as his Honour made them in 1990, I
do not see that sub-section
(10A) requires me to give effect to those findings in a way that displaces my
own assessment, as I have
summarised it, of the applicant.
<P>

	<b>The Determination of the Present Application</b>
<P>

49	Having regard to the whole of the foregoing considerations, I have come to
the conclusion that it would be proper to grant the
present application. I am
encouraged in that view by the stated position of the Crown that the
application is not simply opposed.

<P>

50	I have come to the conclusion that it would be appropriate to determine an
aggregate sentence of penal servitude for 17 years.
I consider that it would be
a just apportionment of such a sentence to provide a minimum term of 12 years
and an additional term
of 5 years. In fixing the minimum term of 12 years, I
proceed upon the basis that the applicant has been in custody for 9 years and
7
months in round terms. The proposed minimum term will entail, therefore, that
the applicant will serve a further 2 years and 5
months in custody.
<P>

51	The present application is, accordingly, granted. In lieu of the sentence of
imprisonment for life that was passed upon the applicant
on 3 July 1990, there
is substituted a sentence of penal servitude for 17 years. That sentence is
apportioned between a minimum term
of 12 years and an additional term of 5
years. The minimum term will commence on 20 July 1989 and will expire on 19
July 2001. The
additional term will commence on 20 July 2001.
<P>

52	It is, I think, neither necessary nor appropriate for this Court to embark
upon the making of elaborate recommendations as to
the future management of the
applicant. I think, however, that it would be fair to express a general
recommendation of the Court
that the applicant's future classification(s) and
management should proceed upon the basis that the applicant has achieved
significant
progress towards ultimate rehabilitation; and that nothing should
be done that discourages the applicant from building further upon
what he has
thus far achieved.
<P>

1	Exhibit C may be returned to the Crown. The certificates and testimonials
forming part of Exhibit 1 may be returned to the applicant.
All other exhibits
will remain in Court pending further order.

<b>19 February 1999</b>
<P>

<b><u>14401/92 - Patricia LAMOND  v  George ARTINIAN &amp; ors</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>	By a Notice of Motion filed on 15 December 1998 Mr.
Phillip Lamond seeks the following relief:
<P>

	"1.	That the Order made on 4 June, 1998 dismissing the Statement of Claim and
striking out the proceedings be set aside.
<P>

	2.	That Phillip Lamond as legal personal representative of the Estate of the
Late Patricia Lamond be substituted as Plaintiff.
<P>

	3.	That these proceedings be transferred to the District Court of NSW.
<P>

	4.	That the costs of this application be costs in the cause."
<P>

2	The relevant factual background is best explained in the form of the
following chronology:
<P>

<b>15.8.90</b>  -  Mrs. Lamond sees Dr. Artinian. She complains of pain of such
a kind and so located as to cause Dr. Artinian to take a Pap smear.
<P>

<b>24.8.90</b>  -  Mrs. Lamond sees Dr. Artinian in connection with the results
of the Pap smear of 15.8.90. Dr. Artinian tells her that the Pap
smear is
"atypical". He does not diagnose cancer, but suggests a follow-up test in not
less than 5 weeks' time.
<P>

<b>8.10.90</b>  -  A repeat Pap smear is taken from Mrs. Lamond.
<P>

<b>15.10.90</b>  -  Dr. Artinian tells Mrs. Lamond that the results of the
second Pap smear are "negative".
<P>

<b>November 1991</b>  -  Mrs. Lamond has further tests done at another clinic.
They return positive results. She is told by Professor Houghton, to whom
she
has been referred, that he cannot believe that the cancerous cells found by the
latest test had not been present 15 or 16 months
previously, that is to say in
August and in October of 1990.
<P>

<b>28.8.92</b>  -  Mrs. Lamond, by her then solicitors, files a statement of
claim in which she proceeds against four defendants. Dr. Artinian is
the first
defendant. Professor Peter Russell, who was concerned with the analysis of the
Pap smears, is the second defendant. An
incorporated clinic connected, as I
understand the fact, with Dr. Artinian, is the third defendant. A corporate
clinical laboratory
connected with Professor Russell is the fourth defendant.
The cause of action, put simply, is that the first and second defendants
failed
negligently to detect, and to advise the plaintiff in connection with, a
condition of cervical cancer from which she was suffering
when they treated her
professionally in August and in October 1990; and that the third and fourth
defendants are, variously, vicariously
liable for such negligence.
<P>

<b>4.9.92</b>  -  The statement of claim is served upon the first and second
defendants.
<P>

[It is not clear when, precisely, the statement of claim was served upon the
third and fourth defendants; but I think it is reasonable
to infer that it was
at or about the same time as service upon the first and second defendants.
Nothing turns upon this particular
detail for the purposes of the present
notice of motion.]
<P>

<b>8.9.92</b>  -  The solicitors acting for the first and second defendants
request extensive further and better particulars.
<P>

<b>15.9.92  -  Mrs. Lamond dies</b>
<P>

<b>29.9.92</b>  -  Mr. Rodney Kent, the then solicitor for Mrs. Lamond,
telephones the solicitor for the first and second defendants, communicating
the
fact of Mrs. Lamond's death, and indicating that the further and better
particulars previously requested by the first and second
defendants will be
provided in due course.
<P>

<b>About October 1992</b>  -  Mr. Lamond contacts Mr. Kent consequent upon the
death of Mrs. Lamond. The affidavit evidence of Mr. Lamond, which was not
challenged
and which I accept, is to the following effect:
<P>

	"7.  Approximately one month or so after Patricia died I telephoned Rodney
Kent, the Solicitor retained by Patricia. I recall that
he said to me words to
the following effect:
<P>

		Matters like this have to be heard in the Supreme Court and there is a five
(5) year waiting list. There would be a series of
actions, on behalf of the
Estate of the Late Patricia Lamond and an action by yourself, Kara and Nicole
against the Pathology Laboratory
and the G.P.
<P>

	I understood that there would be eight different actions pursued in court.
<P>

	8.	Thereafter I spoke to Rodney Kent who acted for me in relation to a number
of matters, many times in the next five years and
I was always given to believe
that the actions had been started. I understood that the actions were chugging
along and were still
in the list of cases to be heard.
<P>

	10.	In about late 1994 Rodney Kent phoned me on a Sunday and said to me words
to the following effect:
<P>

	"The actions will be over by Christmas."
<P>

	I then heard nothing further from Rodney Kent and in about March, 1995 I
telephoned him and was told words to the following effect:
<P>

	"No, it's not going to happen, it's still on the list."
<P>

	This did not cause warning bells to ring in my mind because I understood that
there was a five (5) year waiting list."
<P>

	11.	Approximately eight (8) months ago I was informed by a friend Jan that
matters like this can be run in the District Court.
Over the next few months I
placed about four (4) calls to Rodney Kent but he did not return my call."
<P>

	12.	I then received a telephone call from an associate of Rodney Kent who said
to me words to the following effect:
<P>

	"Rodney, a Barrister and another Solicitor would like to meet with you to
discuss the claims."
<P>

	17.	At no time was I aware that there was a failure to prosecute the
proceedings which had been commenced by Patricia in her own
right. I understood
that my Solicitor, Rodney Kent, had matters in hand and would undertake all
steps which needed to be taken. I
was not aware that the delay which I
experienced in those claims coming to court was untoward. I believe it was the
usual delay inherent
in such matters."
<P>

<b>3.2.93</b>  -  Two letters are written by the solicitor for the first and
second defendants to Mr. Kent as Mrs. Lamond's solicitor. One of these
letters
notes that further and better particulars have not been supplied and presses
for their supply. <b>There is no further correspondence between Mr. Kent, on
behalf of Mrs. Lamond, and the solicitor for the first and second defendants,
between this date in 1993 and 1998.</b>
<P>

<b>24.4.98</b>  -  <b>A notice issues from the Principal Registrar of this
Court.</b>
<P>

[There is particular evidence of such a notice addressed to the solicitors for
the first and second defendants. I think it is reasonable
to infer, and I do
infer accordingly, that an identical notice was sent to the solicitor then
acting for Mrs. Lamond; and to the
solicitors on record for the third and
fourth defendants.]
<P>

<b>The notice, formal parts omitted, is in the following terms:</b>
<P>

	"The above proceedings will be listed for call-over on Thursday 4 June 1998
before The Honourable Justice Wood, CJ at CL.
<P>

	At the call-over, consideration will be given to:-
<P>

	(a) Whether the proceedings would more appropriately be heard in the District
Court;
<P>

	(b) Removal of the proceedings from the list of active matters;
<P>

	(c) Dismissal of the proceedings; or
<P>

	(d) The making of a direction that DCM apply to these proceedings."
<P>

<b>4.6.98</b>  <b>-  Call-over before Wood CJ at CL. The following orders are
made:</b>
<P>

	"1.  That these proceedings be struck out.
<P>

	 2.  That the parties have leave to restore on 14 days' notice."
<P>

All defendants are represented. There is no appearance by or for the plaintiff
in the principal proceedings.
<P>

<b>18.6.98  -  The orders of 4 June 1998 are formally entered.</b>
<P>

<b>15.6.98</b>  -  Mr. Lamond sees in conference counsel instructed by Mr.
Kent's firm. Mr. Kent himself is not in attendance. A different particular
solicitor instructs on the conference. Mr. Lamond confirms instructions that he
wishes to proceed with his late wife's claim and
with associated claims on his
own behalf and on behalf of his two daughters.
<P>

<b>16.6.98</b>  -  Mr. Lamond instructs a new, (and his present), solicitor.
<P>

<b>21.8.98</b>  -  The plaintiff's new solicitor receives from the former
solicitor the relevant file in respect of the principal proceedings.
<P>

<b>11.9.98</b>  -  A conference is held with Mr. Lamond and his further
instructions are taken.
<P>

<b>9.10.98</b>  -  The solicitor newly instructed by Mr. Lamond seeks to file a
formal Notice of Appearance. This leads to:
<P>

<b>12.10.98</b>  -  It is first brought to the attention of the new solicitor
that orders, in the terms noted previously herein, had been made on
4 June
1998.
<P>

<b>13.10.98</b>  -  Mr. Lamond learns of the orders of 4 June 1998.
<P>

<b>13.10.98  </b>-  The new solicitor puts in train steps to obtain affidavit
evidence to ground an application to restore the principal proceedings
to the
list in accordance with the leave in that behalf granted by the orders of Wood
CJ at CL.
<P>

<b>4.11.98</b>  -  Mr. Lamond swears his affidavit in support of the present
Notice of Motion.
<P>

<b>14.12.98</b>  -  The present Notice of Motion is signed by Mr. Lamond's
solicitor, and:
<P>

<b>15.12.98</b>  -  The present Notice of Motion and supporting affidavit of
Mrs. Lamond are filed.
<P>

3	Given the foregoing sequence of events, I think that the following
conclusions are fairly available:
<P>

4	1.	It is completely clear that the progress of the principal proceedings
which were commenced by Mrs. Lamond has been marked by
what the relevant
authorities describe as inordinate delay. 
<P>

	2.	That inordinate delay is wholly unexplained except to the extent that it
was clearly attributable to a manifest failure on the
part of the solicitor
originally retained by Mr. and Mrs. Lamond, to pursue with proper professional
diligence and efficiency the
prosecution of the principal proceedings. 
<P>

	3.	If the evidence of the Mr. Lamond in support of the present application be
accepted, - and, as earlier indicated, I do accept
it, - then it has not been
shown that either Mr. Lamond or his late wife was in any way responsible for
the inordinate delay to which
I have referred.
<P>

	4.	It must be a matter of obvious concern on the present occasion that Mr.
Lamond did not appear at, and was not represented at,
the call-up before Wood
CJ at CL. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that Mr. Lamond himself had
any idea that such a call-up
had issued from the Court; or that it entailed, at
the very least, a real risk that the principal proceedings might be struck out
of the active list.
<P>

5	The evidence at present available does not enable this Court to make a
finding as to what exactly it was that caused Mr. Lamond's
former solicitor to
do either little or nothing in the proper and diligent prosecution of his
client's case. The Court has not heard
from Mr. Kent, the previous solicitor.
The Court has not seen any material derived from Mr. Kent's files or other
relevant records.
It might very well prove to be the case that a proper
examination of Mr. Kent's conduct with respect to the prosecution of the
principal
proceedings would indicate the appropriateness of some proper
professional disciplinary proceedings being taken against him. There
might be
other forms of redress seen as appropriate upon such enquiry. All this Court
can say is that it is not in a position to
make any concluded findings about
those matters. The relevant finding which this Court can make, on the evidence
before it, is that
it has not been shown that Mr. Lamond or his late wife were
at fault in connection with the failure diligently to prosecute the principal
proceedings.
<P>

6	In connection with point 4, it is convenient to notice a particular
submission put for the defendants. The particular submission
is put succinctly
in the following extract from the written submissions put in for the first and
second defendants:
<P>

	"Based on the matters referred to in the affidavit of Phillip Lamond sworn 4
December 1998 it is strongly submitted that an alternative
course of action
against another person is available to the plaintiff; see <b>R v Birks
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2019%20NSWLR%20677" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 19 NSWLR 677</a>, and that this would be a more just and fair method of
disposing of the plaintiff's claim."
<P>

7	That submission, put another way, is that Mr. Lamond should be relegated to
such rights as he might have in civil proceedings
for negligence brought by him
against Mr. Kent, the former solicitor for Mr. Lamond and his late wife.
<P>

8	The reference made by this submission to the decision of the Court of Appeal
in <b>Birks</b> is, in my respectful opinion, misconceived. <b>Birks</b> had to
do, not with a civil action, but with a criminal trial. It turned upon the
question whether there might not be, in a particular
case, incompetence of the
accused's representative at trial, so flagrant as to constitute, without more,
a miscarriage of justice
calling for appellate intervention by the Court of
Criminal Appeal. That question was answered in the affirmative; but with the
obvious
qualification that such cases cannot be defined with academic
precision, each alleged case of such flagrant incompetence having to
be looked
at on its own merits, and corrected in a proper case. 
<P>

9	There is, however, directly on point a decision of the Court of Appeal of
this Court: <b>Morrision and anor.  v  Judd</b>, unreported, 10 October 1995.
Kirby P, (Meagher and Powell JJA concurring), having surveyed the relevant
authorities, both in Australia
and in the United Kingdom, expresses as follows
the governing principle:
<P>

	"The availability of an action against a negligent legal representative is
relevant because common sense says that it is so. It
means that the litigant,
who may be wholly or mainly innocent, is not put out of court without some
chance of redress, however difficult
that chance may be to enforce. To that
extent an injustice, which might otherwise occur to the litigant, may be
capable of being
avoided. However, precisely because of the kind of
difficulties which Smith J listed in <b>Scardamaglia</b>, it is a consideration
which `cannot carry much weight'. See per Kirby P at p.11.
<P>

10	I propose to adopt that approach in connection with the present
application.
<P>

11	What has been said thus far entails that the focus of the present
application now shifts to two distinct, but related, questions.
The first
question is whether, if the principal proceedings are restored to the active
list and permitted to proceed to trial, a
trial can be held that will be just
to all the interested parties. The second question is whether, if the principal
proceedings are
so restored and permitted to proceed to trial, there will be
occasioned to the defendants, or any one or more of them, prejudice
of so
manifest, and manifestly unfair, a kind as would entail, in a real and
practical sense, injustice. 
<P>

12	The present application is, of course, an application made by Mr. Lamond;
and it is, therefore, for him to demonstrate that in
the end result it would be
just to give him the substance of the relief which he seeks in his Notice of
Motion. That does not mean,
however, that Mr. Lamond bears in a simple and
absolute sense the evidentiary burden of proof as to any and every issue that
has
to be decided in the course of coming to a reasoned conclusion upon that
ultimate question.
<P>

13	This is, I think, a matter of some practical significance in the
consideration of the present application. The evidence put forward,
both by Mr.
Lamond and by the defendants, on the related issues of unfair prejudice and
prospects of a fair trial, is fairly thin.
This makes it important, in my
opinion, to be clear that there are some issues arising in connection with the
present application
as to which it is fair to hold the defendants, rather than
Mr. Lamond, to the evidentiary burden of proof. It is, perhaps, permissible
to
approach the question of evidentiary burden of proof by an alternative path and
as  discussed by Dixon CJ in <b>Hampton Court Ltd v Crooks</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1957/28.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1957] HCA 28</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281957%29%2097%20CLR%20367" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1957) 97 CLR
367</a> at 371-372. In the present particular case, I do not think that, in the
end, a great deal turns on how, as between those two suggested
alternative
approaches, one deals with the practical question of identifying the party or
parties upon whom the burden rests of demonstrating
unfair prejudice or
inadequate prospects of a fair trial. What does need to be established clearly,
in my opinion, is that in a case
such as the present one, the defendants cannot
simply take the view that it is, in a peremptory sense, for the plaintiff to
establish
affirmatively, and on evidence led by him, that a fair trial can be
had; and that there is no unacceptable prejudice entailed to
the defendants, or
any of them, by the restoration to the active list of the principal
proceedings.
<P>

14	Against that background, it is appropriate to turn, next, to three decisions
of the English Court of Appeal.
<P>

15	The first decision is that of <b>Hornagold v Fairclough Building and anor:
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20TLR%20316" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) TLR 316.</a> This was a case in which a District Judge had struck out an
action for want of prosecution. A Divisional Judge had dismissed an appeal
from
that primary decision. A Court of Appeal comprising Glidewell and Roch LLJJ
allowed an appeal and reinstated the particular
action. The report in the Times
Law Reports concentrates on the judgment of Roch LJ. The following passages are
relevant:
<P>

	"His Lordship said that the conclusion that he had reached, having regard to
the authorities, was that to succeed in such an application
a defendant had to
produce some evidence either that there had been a significant addition to the
substantial risk that there could
not be a fair trial caused by the
post-commencement of proceedings period or by periods of inordinate and
inexcusable delay or that
there had been a significant addition to the
prejudice to a defendant.
<P>

	By saying that he did not say that inference had no part to play in the
process of resolving the issue of "more than minimal additional
prejudice", or
that the court could not draw inferences from evidence contained in
affidavits.
<P>

	But there had to be more than the bald assertion that the delay had prejudiced
the defendants or that it had created a substantial
risk that a fair trial
would not be possible or that it had added to existing prejudice or to the
existing risk that a fair trial
would not be possible.
<P>

	There had to be some indication of the prejudice, for example that no
statement was taken at the time of the material events so
that a particular
witness who would have been called on a particular issue had no means of
refreshing his memory, or that a particular
witness who was to be called on a
particular issue was of an advanced age and no longer wished to give evidence
or had become infirm
and unavailable in the period of the further inordinate
and inexcusable delay.
<P>

	Turning to the present case, what was contained in the affidavits was
insufficient.
<P>

	As the judge had said, the defendants did not identify the particular
witnesses nor the particular respects in which their evidence
had been
impaired.
<P>

	Where his Lordship differed from the judge was that it was incumbent on
defendants always to identify a particular witness or a
particular respect in
which their evidence had been impaired or a particular reason why they said
that there was a substantial risk
that there could no longer be a fair trial of
the issues.
<P>

	Were the mere assertion of prejudice to be sufficient, then that would in
effect transfer the burden of proof on that issue to
the plaintiff, a
submission that was expressly rejected by the House of Lords in <i>Department
of Transport v Chris Smaller Ltd (</i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%20AC%201197" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] AC 1197).</a>
<P>

16	The second decision is that of the Court of Appeal <b>Rowe v Glenister and
ors.</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20TLR%20463" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) TLR 463.</a> The note of the decision is very brief and is in the
following terms:
<P>

	"LORD JUSTICE WAITE said that it was not enough for the defendant to show
merely that memories must have grown fainter during the
period of post-writ
delay.
<P>

	He had to establish that in some specific respect particular witnesses had
become disabled, by reason of the lapse of time during
the period of culpable
delay, from giving evidence as cogent and complete as they would have been in a
position to give had the trial
been held without the delay."
<P>

17	The third decision is that of the Court of Appeal in <b>Slade v Adco
Ltd</b>:  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20TLR%20650" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) TLR 650.</a> It is relevant to quote the following observations of
Auld LJ. His Lordship was in dissent as to the outcome of the particular
appeal;
but the passages to be quoted do not propound principles to the
contrary of anything said in the two majority judgments. 
<P>

	"The judge's reasoning raised again, and in an acute form, the question as to
how the courts should determine the existence of
a likelihood of serious
prejudice to a defendant where there was no evidence of prejudice other than
that of the delay itself. The
authorities suggested two different answers.
<P>

	The first was that the court might infer simply from the length of a delay
that it was likely to have dimmed or distorted the memories
of witnesses.
<P>

	The second was that there must be some evidence, other than that of the delay
itself, from which a court might draw that inference.
The debate also involved
a difference of judicial opinion as to whether memory faded earlier or
later.
<P>

	His Lordship agreed with the analysis of the Court of Appeal in <i>Rowe v
Glenister &amp; Sons Ltd </i>(The Times August 7 1995:   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1995%5d%20TLR%20463" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1995] TLR 463)</a> which
was essentially the same as that of Lord Justice Roch in <i>Hornagold v
Fairclough Building Ltd </i>([1993] PIQR 400) and was consistent with the
broader statement of Lord Justice Glidewell in that case of the same
principle.
<P>

	It was that there must normally be some evidence from which the likelihood of
serious prejudice to the defendant could be inferred.
It was important to cling
to that principle while the rule in <i>Birkett v James </i>([1978] AC 297)
stood, for if it was lost there was no basis, other than one of "feel", for
distinguishing between a double presumption
of impairment of memory and of
consequent serious prejudice merely because of long culpable delay, from a
reasoned inference in the
particular circumstances of a case that such serious
prejudice was likely to result from culpable delay.
<P>

	In his Lordship's judgment, the judge wrongly inferred from the length of
delay without more than the plaintiff's and Mr. Garlick's
memories were likely
to have been impaired by the plaintiff's culpable delay and that it was likely
seriously to prejudice the defendant's
defence. His Lordship could see no
evidential or other basis for such an inference.
<P>

	The mere identification of the witnesses and of the importance of the evidence
that they were to give did not, in his Lordship's
view, satisfy the test.
<P>

	Something more was required, some evidence or circumstances from which it
could be inferred that the delay had caused some specific
problem for one or
both of the witnesses, as distinct from a general impairment of memory from the
passage of time, and that it was
likely to seriously prejudice the
defendant."
<P>

18	It is also relevant for present purposes to notice the following
observations of Neill LJ:
<P>

	"LORD JUSTICE NEILL, agreeing with Lord Justice Glidewell, said that the onus
of proving prejudice or the impossibility of a fair
trial rested on the person
who asserted it.
<P>

	It was clear that in order to establish prejudice it was not enough merely to
assert that in the nature of things memories would
have dimmed with the passage
of time.
<P>

	There was less certainty, however, as to the precise nature and the degree of
particularity of the evidence which the court would
require before the onus was
discharged.
<P>

	In reaching a conclusion on that difficult point it was necessary to take into
account some other factors.
<P>

	1.	The quality of oral evidence was likely to fall away much more rapidly in
the early months and years rather than at a later
stage. On the other hand
there was great difficulty in attributing a dimming of memory to any particular
period of time.
<P>

	2.	Account must also be taken of the fact that delay might create difficulties
for a defendant when he sought to test by way of
cross-examination the
reliability of the plaintiff and his witnesses.
<P>

	His Lordship had come to the conclusion that it was unwise to try to lay down
any strict guidelines for the exercise of the judge's
discretion in the
individual case. The onus was on the person asserting prejudice or a
substantial risk to a fair trial to establish
it.
<P>

	He would have to show that the prejudice or risk had been caused by the
inordinate and inexcusable delay since the issue of the
writ. A mere assertion
was not enough.
<P>

	But, in his Lordship's view, the individual judge should be left to assess the
prejudice and the risk and the adequacy of the evidence
in the light of the
individual circumstances of the case.
<P>

	That approach was in accordance with the guidance given by the House of Lords
in <i>Roebuck v Mungovin  </i>([1994] 2 AC 224)."
<P>

19	At the hearing of the present application, no reference was made to any of
the foregoing three decisions; but, equally, no reference
was made to any
authority to the contrary of what is there propounded. It suffices to say for
present purposes that, with one particular
exception to which I shall come
presently, I am not satisfied by the whole of the evidence adduced at the
hearing of the present
application, that there has been demonstrated in the
requisite particular way, unfair prejudice and unacceptable prospects of a fair
trial.
<P>

20	The one exception of which I have spoken is derived from paragraph 11 of an
affidavit sworn by Miss Tricia Hobson, the solicitor
having the practical
carriage of the present application on behalf of the fourth defendant. That
paragraph is in the following terms:
<P>

	"11.	If this matter were to proceed to trial, it is anticipated that all
employees of the fourth defendant who were involved in
the screening of each of
the two pap smears, may need to be called as witnesses. I am instructed that
there were four or possibly
five such employees. Of these, three cannot
currently be located. They are no longer employed by the fourth defendant.
Attempts are
currently being undertaken to locate these potential witnesses by
another employee of the fourth defendant but at the time of swearing
this
affidavit, they had not been located."
<P>

21	I recognise that this paragraph at least attempts to come to grips with the
practical requirements of which I have earlier been
speaking. I do not think,
however, that it is sufficient to carry the day for the fourth defendant, let
alone for all four defendants.
It is to be kept in mind that, so far as
concerns the fourth defendant, its liability is said to arise vicariously by
reason of the
actionable negligence of the second defendant. It is, as I
understand the case to be made against the fourth defendant, essentially
by
reference to what the second defendant did or failed to do, that it is to be
decided whether or not the fourth defendant is answerable
in damages in the
present proceedings. Quite apart from that consideration, I would think it
necessary for the fourth defendant to
have given the Court, in connection with
the present application, at least some idea of what had been done to trace the
relevant
records of the fourth defendant, and with what practical results and
practical consequences.
<P>

22	I should note, also, a submission put for the defendants and to the effect
that it is relevant to the exercise of the Court's
discretion in connection
with the present notice of motion, that the defendants have been kept, and are
being kept, at risk. Reliance
is placed in that connection upon a decision of
Waddell J: <b>Southern Cross Exploration NL and ors.   v   Fire and All Risks
Insurance Co. Ltd and ors. </b>(1986) 4 NSWLR. Put shortly, the relevant
principle there established is that: ".........the fact that a defendant is
being kept at
risk is relevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion to
dismiss proceedings for want of prosecution as a matter distinct from
prejudice
in the conduct of the action". The point is further examined in the decision of
the House of Lords: <b>Department of Transport and Chris Smaller (Transport)
Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%20AC%201197" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) AC 1197.</a> Five Lords of Appeal Ordinary concurred in the
following statements of principle appearing in the speech of Lord Griffiths at
1209
F-1210A:
<P>

	"I would, however, express a note of caution against allowing the mere fact of
the anxiety that accompanies any litigation being
regarded as of itself a
sufficient prejudice to justify striking out an action.  [Counsel] did not seek
to argue that the anxiety
occasioned by the extra 13 months in this case should
be regarded as a sufficient ground of prejudice to justify making a striking
out order. There are, however, passages in some of the judgments that suggest
that the mere sword of Damocles, hanging for an unnecessary
period, might be a
sufficient reason of itself to strike out. On this aspect I repeat the note of
caution I expressed in the Court
of Appeal in <b>Eagil Trust Co Ltd  v
Pigott-Brown</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20All%20ER%20119" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 All ER 119</a>, 124, where I said
<P>

	"Any action is bound to cause anxiety, but it would as a general rule be an
exceptional case where that sort of anxiety alone would
found a sufficient
ground for striking out in the absence of evidence of any particular prejudice.
<b>Biss's</b> case is an example of such an exceptional case, the action
hanging over for 11-1/2 years, with professional reputations at stake."
<P>

23	I accept, of course, the principle established by the foregoing decisions. I
recognise, of course, the prima facie analogy between
the particular facts of
the present case and the particular facts, as noted by Lord Griffiths, of
<b>Biss v Lamberth Southwark and Lewisham Area Health Authority (Teaching)</b>
(1978) 1WLR 382. I do not perceive, however, any evidence on the present
application, which is so cogent with regard to this element
of personal and
professional prejudice as would, so to speak, cancel out the other
considerations of which I have spoken.
<P>

24	For the whole of the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that it would be just
to give the Mr. Lamond the substance of the relief
that he seeks in the first
three paragraphs of his Notice of Motion. In that connection I make the
following particular orders:
<P>

1.	That proceedings numbered 14401 of 1992 in the Common Law Division of this
Court be restored to the active list of that Division.
<P>

2.	That Phillip Lamond, the husband of the late Patricia Lamond, be substituted
as plaintiff in such restored proceedings.
<P>

3.	That, not later than 7 days from the date of publication of this judgment, a
copy of the order giving effect to Order 2 above
be served upon each of the
four defendants to the principal proceedings. In default of such service on any
defendant, then the principal
proceedings will stand, by virtue of SCR Pt. 8 R.
12(1)(b), dismissed as against that defendant. I direct that service by
facsimile
transmission will be sufficient compliance with this order.
<P>

4.	That the proceedings be transferred not later than 21 days after the date of
publication of the present judgment into the District
Court of New South
Wales.
<P>

25	The Notice of Motion seeks an order that the costs of the application, if
the application be successful, be costs in the cause.
All four defendants
submitted that, even were the application successful, the plaintiff should be
ordered to pay their costs of the
present application. The first, second and
third defendants seek also, in such event, their costs of the call-over before
Wood CJ
at CL.
<P>

26	As at present advised, I would think that there is a strong prima facie case
for the making of an order that Mr. Rodney Kent
personally pay the costs of all
parties to the present application, and the costs, also, of the first, second
and third defendants
in connection with the call-over before Wood CJ at CL. I
think that SCR Pt. 52A R4 (5)(e) confers the necessary power in that behalf.
I
think, however, that such an order could not properly be made without first
giving Mr. Kent a fair opportunity to be heard upon
the question. That course,
were it to be followed, would entail even further delay and expense in the
present proceedings.
<P>

27	I will, therefore, order formally that the substituted plaintiff, that is to
say Mr. Lamond, pay the costs of all four defendants
of the present Notice of
Motion. In that connection, and for the assistance of any assessment of those
costs, I note that the solicitor
appearing for the first and second defendants
made submissions upon which the third and fourth defendants were content to
rely without
addition. I note, also in that connection, that the solicitor
appearing for the third defendant did no more at the hearing of the
Notice of
Motion than, in effect, to hold a watching brief. I note, also and finally in
connection with any assessment of costs,
that the solicitor appearing for the
fourth defendant read her own affidavit and otherwise held, effectively, a
watching brief.
<P>

28	With regard to the costs of the call-over before Wood CJ at CL, I think it
just that the substituted plaintiff pay the costs
of the first, second and
third defendants of that appearance. The fourth defendant, as earlier noted,
does not seek costs in respect
of that particular hearing.
<P>

29	The formal order as to costs therefore will be:
<P>

5.	That the plaintiff pay the costs, as agreed or assessed, of all four
defendants of the present Notice of Motion; and the costs
of the first, second
and third defendants, of the call-over on 4 June 1998 before Wood CJ at CL.
