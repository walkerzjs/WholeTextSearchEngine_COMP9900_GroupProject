<i>Thursday, 16 September 1999</i>
<P>

<b>2809/99	STARR INVESTMENTS (AUSTRALIA) PTY LIMITED   -v-   MECAFREE PTY
LIMITED</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>ACTING MASTER:</b>    These proceedings are one in a
number of proceedings in a number of Courts between the two parties. Some
background is required
in order to understand the current relationship of the
two parties and, therefore, the defendant's notice of motion which was filed
on
27 July 1999. 
<P>

2   	That notice of motion sought three orders although, at the
commencement of the hearing of the motion, Counsel for the defendant
advised
that he would no longer be pressing for order 3 in the motion.
<P>

3   	The notice of motion seeks an order that the proceedings be
dismissed on the ground that they are an abuse of process or alternatively
that
proceedings be stayed pending the determination of common law proceedings 10722
of 1999. 
<P>

4   	On 28 February 1997 a contract of sale was executed between
the plaintiff and the defendant whereby the defendant purchased
Lot 102, 16
Bermill Street, Rockdale. The price was $500,000. On 11 April 1997 vendor
finance was provided by the plaintiff to the
defendant in the amount of
$135,000 and secured by way of second mortgage over the property. On 11 July
1997 the loan was due and
payable and, together with interest, totalled
$139,050. In January 1999 the plaintiff served a statutory demand on the
defendant.
That demand was served on 14 January. Thereafter a number of
proceedings have been commenced in the Local Court and the Supreme Court.
In
March 1999 the defendant commenced proceedings in the Local Court for recovery
of money alleged to be owed by the plaintiff in
relation to supervision and
certification of works performed by the defendant and in relation to (it would
seem but it is not clear)
payments made by the defendant to various companies
and tradespeople for work performed during 1997 on the property.
<P>

5   	On 9 March 1999 the defendant in proceedings 1628 of 1999
sought to set aside the statutory demand. On 28 March 1999 the plaintiff
commenced proceedings in the Common Law Division in proceedings 10722 of 1999
seeking possession of the property and the repayment
of the amount due under
the mortgage. Subsequently on 4 May 1999, by consent, proceedings 1628 of 1999
were dismissed. On 17 May
1999 Giles Woodgate was appointed receiver of the
property. On 18 June 1999 the plaintiff commenced the current proceedings to
wind
up the company. Shortly thereafter on 2 July 1999 the defendant commenced
proceedings in matter 2967 of 1999 seeking interim injunctions
against the
plaintiff and the receiver from exercising the power of sale and an order for
the removal of the receiver. Those proceedings
were heard before Mr Justice
Young on 19 July 1999 and his Honour made orders restraining the receiver from
selling the property
on the condition that the defendant pay into Court $89,000
by 26 July and amend its summons or pleading in the Common Law Division.
The
defendant was unable to raise the $89,000 pursuant to the order of Mr Justice
Young. On 9 August those proceedings were dismissed.
<P>

6   	In his Honour's judgment, Mr Justice Young made a number of
observations. He noted that it was alleged by the mortgagor that
it was a
condition of the mortgage that no principal or interest was to be paid until
certain building works were done and completed.
Secondly, that it had an
equitable set off for building works that were done as part and parcel of the
same transaction to which
the mortgage was granted. Mecafree submitted its
equitable set off was in the order of $230,000 and certainly at least $160,000.
The amount claimed by the mortgagee, Starr Investments, was $135,000 for
principal and approximately $4,300 for interest. 
<P>

7   	So far as the precondition to the mortgage that moneys
would only become payable if certain things came about, his Honour appeared
to
be of the opinion that, as the evidence presently constituted, Mecafree's
position was rather weak. In his Honour's view the material
that was proffered
was rather nebulous and nowhere near the material which, if accepted at the
trial, would form the basis for a
claim that no money was payable until all the
building works were done. His Honour accordingly considered that there is no
<i>prima facie</i> case so far as that part of the application is concerned.
However, his Honour held a different view so far as equitable set off was
concerned. The view expressed at page 4 is as follows:
<P>

The question of equitable set off, however, is one where there is material
which, if accepted by the trial Court, may amount to
a valid claim
<P>

8   	His Honour noted the argument by Counsel for Starr
Investments that there appeared to be some inconsistencies in the evidence
by
the principal witness for Mecafree that no invoices had been put into evidence.
However, his Honour then went on to say:
<P>

It does seem to me that if the evidence of the plaintiff mortgagor (Mecafree)
is accepted that there is a situation where there
could be offsetting
transactions which should in Equity be set off against the mortgage debt.
<P>

9   	Subsequently, in matter 10722 of 1999 Mecafree filed its
defence. The defence filed on 26 July 1999 puts in issue a liability
of
Mecafree to pay any moneys for principal and interest on the mortgage.
Paragraph 2 of the defence pleads the condition that his
Honour referred to in
his judgment. Paragraph 8 of the defence pleads an equitable set off although
it would appear to be a <i>quantum meruit</i> claim. The particulars set out by
way of description of work, invoices and amounts what Mecafree alleges is owing
to it pursuant
to the work formed in relation to the property. 
<P>

10   	A defence of equitable set off will exist where it would
be inequitable for the plaintiff to be permitted to proceed with
its claim
without making allowance for the defendant's claim against it: <i>Roadshow
Entertainment Pty Limited v CAN 053 006 269 Pty Limited</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1997/473.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] NSWSC 473</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%2042%20NSWLR%20462" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] 42 NSWLR
462.</a> An equitable set off is available as a defence where it impeaches the
plaintiff's title. There is some doubt as to whether it can
be raised as a
defence where the plaintiff's title is not directly impeached: <i>Re KL
Tractors Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1954%5d%20VR%20505" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1954] VR 505.</a> However, that appears to be a narrow
definition of availability of the equitable set off. In modern times courts
appear to have taken
a broader approach to equitable set off. A number of
authorities favour a wider basis for the defence and would regard it as
available
whenever two claims arise out of the same transaction and are
inseparably connected: <i>Bank of Boston Conneticut v European Grain and
Shipping </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%201%20AC%201056" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1989] 1 AC 1056.</a> Similarly, in <i>Popular Homes Limited v Circuit
Developments Limited</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%202%20NZLR%20642" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1979] 2 NZLR 642</a> the court permitted the
plaintiff/purchaser/mortgagor to set off against secured indebtedness to the
defendant/vendor/mortgagee.
Its claim against the defendant for damages for
breaching a covenant to lend further money which would have enabled the
completion
of the building development on the land and the sale thereof to
produce funds to repay all outstandings.
<P>

11   	In determining what the test for equitable set off is it
would appear that the relevant circumstances that the Court considers
are,
firstly, the nature of the claim; secondly, the nature of the connection
between them; thirdly, the conduct of the parties.
For example, delay by a
defendant pursuing a cross-claim. 
<P>

12   	It would appear that, therefore, arguably the defendant
does have a defence of equitable set off. Certainly on the material
before Mr
Justice Young he formed a preliminary view that that may be the case. The
plaintiff, Starr Investments, has not in the
Common Law proceedings, sought to
have the defence and, in particular, paragraph 8 of the defence, struck out.
That defence has been
on foot now for some six weeks. On winding up proceedings
it is not my role to determine the substance of whether or not the defence
is
made out. 
<P>

13   	For the plaintiff it is said that the notice of motion
should be dismissed and that the winding up application should proceed.
The
bases for this submission are, firstly, that there is a current debt owed by
the defendant to the plaintiff. Secondly, that there
is no suggestion that
there are collateral purposes for bringing these proceedings. The common law
proceedings involves not only
the parties in these proceedings but also another
party. Thirdly, that there is no evidence of solvency. If the company is in
fact
insolvent, it is submitted that it can never be an abuse of process to
bring proceedings to wind the company up. 
<P>

14   	For the defendant it is said that it is not appropriate to
determine the winding up proceedings before the common law proceedings
have
been determined. There is adequate protection for the plaintiff should it
ultimately proceed. The plaintiff is a secured creditor.
There has been a
receiver appointed to the property. The winding up would not realise more to
the secured creditor. Therefore, the
purpose of bringing the winding up
proceedings is to coerce the defendant to pay the disputed debt. There has been
no evidence that
there are any other creditors of the company and in any event
the company is not a trading company. Its only activity is in relation
to the
Rockdale property.
<P>

15   	It is submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the
company is seeking to avoid the requirements of section 459H and 459S
by
seeking to have the proceedings dismissed or stayed on the basis that the
proceedings are an abuse of process. It is put that
it could never be an abuse
of process where a company is insolvent and proceedings are commenced to wind
the company up notwithstanding
other proceedings are on foot. In the present
proceedings it is conceded by both parties that the time for bringing an
application
for setting aside a statutory demand has well and truly passed. It
is also conceded by both parties that the presumption of insolvency
under
section 459C has expired. 
<P>

16   	One matter that would need to be considered when
determining whether or not an order should be made in accordance with either
paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 in the notice of motion is the question of solvency.
As matters stood before me reliance on the statutory
demand for the presumption
of insolvency could no longer be maintained by the plaintiff. A statutory
demand is never evidenced on
actual insolvency. It merely creates a
presumption. The period which the plaintiff can rely on that presumption has
now expired.
Nevertheless, there still is a notice. The plaintiff would only be
able to succeed on the winding up summons if it can establish
actual insolvency
of the defendant. 
<P>

17   	The plaintiff, on the question of insolvency, relies on a
number of matters. Firstly, the evidence of the director of the
defendant
company. The defendant does not have $89,000 in liquid assets. That, of course,
is a reference to the order made by Mr
Justice Young. The only other evidence
put on by the defendant is contained in the director's affidavits. He deposes
the fact that
the financial position of the defendant is such that there is a
surplus of assets over liabilities and that it is paying its creditors
currently although the tenants are paying to the receiver in lieu of Mecafree.
There is no direct evidence on that last point. As
far as the first statement
concerning the surplus of assets over liabilities there is no evidence in
relation to that. There is no
independent evidence by an accountant disclosing
what the true financial position of the company is. There is no evidence
concerning
annual financial statements for the company either audited or
unaudited over the last two years. There is no material before me which
establishes that the defendant is solvent. 
<P>

18   	If the company were to be wound up it would be a matter
for the liquidator to determine whether he should continue the defence
of the
common law proceedings. To that extent the creditors and shareholders of the
defendant company will not be prejudiced by the
appointment of a liquidator.
Such an appointment, of course, would be a person other than Mr Woodgate. 
<P>

19   	I am not satisfied that the actions of the plaintiff could
be regarded as an abuse of process. Whilst it is true that the
common law
proceedings were commenced before the winding up proceedings and, in fact,
commenced some three months beforehand the
defendant was on notice that winding
up proceedings would, in all probability, be commenced. The fact that the
notice of demand was
served in January and in non-compliance with that save as
to an order by the Court setting aside the demand would, in all probability,
be
the trigger for the summons seeking the winding up of the company to be filed.
The common law proceedings are for possession of
land and the payment of a sum
of money. The winding up proceedings are based on the failure by the defendant
to pay in accordance
with the mortgage. The fact that there is no evidence
which supports the position that the defendant is solvent coupled with the
fact
that the amounts that the defendant claims by way of set off are, according to
the various invoices, amounts which were invoiced
between August 1997 and July
1998, but nothing done to recover those sums or to put them in issue until the
matter came before Mr
Justice Young indicates that if the dispute is genuine
that is a matter that the liquidator can take on board. Perhaps if there was
a
serious issue in relation to these invoices the defendant would not have
delayed up to two years before articulating a defence/cause
of action against
the plaintiff. It was always open to the company to bring proceedings against
the plaintiff for recovery of those
sums. In <i>Hunter v Chief Constable for
the West Midlands Police</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/13.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1981] UKHL 13</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%20AC%20529" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] AC 529</a>, at page 536, Lord Diplock said:
<P>

The inherent power which any court of justice must possess to prevent misuse of
its procedure in a way which, although not inconsistent
with the literal
application of the procedural rules, would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to
a party to litigation before it
or would otherwise bring the administration of
justice into disrepute among right thinking people.
<P>

20   	In the present case I find it hard to accept that on the
material that has been before me that it could be said that it would
be
manifestly unfair to the defendant to allow the winding up proceedings to
proceed when there is concurrently in the Common Law
Division other proceedings
between the same parties. True it is that the basis of the proceedings have
their genesis in the mortgage.
However, I do not see that it would be
manifestly unfair to proceed on the winding up application and if the plaintiff
were able
to establish insolvency of the defendant for there to be a liquidator
to be appointed. It would then be a matter for the liquidator
who, in all
probability, would be far more objective than the parties to determine whether
or not the defence to the common law proceedings
should be maintained. 
<P>

21   	Therefore, on the defendant's notice of motion, I decline
to make the orders sought. The notice of motion is dismissed. The
defendant to
pay the plaintiff's costs of the motion.
