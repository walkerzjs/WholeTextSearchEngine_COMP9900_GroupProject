AUSTIN J
<P>

THURSDAY 2 SEPTEMBER 1999
<P>

<b>2881/98 . CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF STAMP DUTIES  v  PALIFLEX PTY LTD</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT </b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  By a contract dated 5 September 1997 the defendant
purchased the property at 97 Elizabeth Bay Road, Elizabeth Bay
from the
Commonwealth of Australia for $9 million.  The defendant contended that no
stamp duty was payable.  After negotiations between
the parties, the plaintiff
released the memorandum of transfer of the property to the defendant in return
for the defendant's undertaking
to pay assessed stamp duty and interest.
Completion of the sale took place on 30 January 1998 and the transfer in favour
of the defendant
was registered on 4 February 1998.  
<P>

2  	The plaintiff assessed ad valorem stamp duty on the contract as
an agreement for sale in the sum of $480,490.  After further
negotiations, the
plaintiff wrote to the defendant on 6 April 1998 demanding payment of the
assessed duty and a 100% fine, totalling
$960,980.  When payment was not made
the plaintiff served a statutory demand on the defendant under s 459E of the
Corporations Law
for approximately that amount.  In my judgment delivered on 4
February 1999 ((1999)  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=17%20ACLC%20467" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">17 ACLC 467)</a> I held that the statutory demand was
effectively served by the plaintiff on the defendant on 13 May 1998, although
it did not come
to the attention of the defendant's director until 1 July
1998.
<P>

3  	Payment not having been made, on 19 June 1998 the plaintiff filed
in this Court a summons for the winding up of the defendant.
 The defendant
sought to resist the winding up summons by contending that no stamp duty was
payable in respect of the contract of
sale and transfer of the Elizabeth Bay
property;  that, consequently, the plaintiff was not a creditor of the
defendant;  and that
the plaintiff therefore had no standing under s 459P of
the Corporations Law to apply to the Court for the defendant to be wound
up.
The proceedings came before me for hearing on 10, 14 and 18 December 1998.
<P>

4  	In my judgment of 4 February 1999 I held that the defendant could
not make these contentions except by leave granted under s
459S of the
Corporations Law.  However, in the circumstances of the case I granted leave
under that section.  Since the defendant's
contentions raised a matter under
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> or involving its interpretation, I directed the defendant to
give the Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General notices under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s78b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 78B</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/" class="autolink_findacts">Judiciary Act 1903</a> (Cth).  The Commonwealth of Australia has intervened in the
proceedings under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ja1903112/s78a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 78A</a>, though the Territories and the States other than New
South Wales have chosen not to do so at this stage.
<P>

5  	In consequence of my judgment of 4 February 1999, at least one
and possibly two matters remained to be resolved in these proceedings.
 First,
it is necessary to determine the defendant's contention, made pursuant to the
leave granted by me under s 459S, that the
amount claimed in the statutory
demand is not a debt due and payable by the defendant to the plaintiff.  I have
now decided, for
reasons which I shall set out below, that the defendant's
contention on this point, supported by the Commonwealth, is correct.  However,
if the defendant's contention had failed then a second question would have
arisen for determination, namely whether the defendant
should be wound up in
insolvency under s 459A.  The defendant has sought to rely on evidence of
solvency in order to rebut the presumption
of insolvency which arose under s
459C because of its failure to comply with the statutory demand.  Although the
defendant has succeeded
on the first matter, the presumption of insolvency
under s 459C nevertheless remains and it would be possible for the Court to
substitute
another creditor as plaintiff in the winding up proceedings under s
465B.  However, no such application has been made, and I therefore
propose to
dismiss the winding up summons. 
<P>

6  	A further hearing was fixed for 19 August 1999 for the
determination of these remaining matters by me.  Both the plaintiff and
the
Solicitor General for the Commonwealth, intervening, contended that no debt is
owing because the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act 1920</a> (NSW), in force at the relevant time,
was outside the legislative competence of the New South Wales Parliament to the
extent that
its provisions purported to apply to a conveyance or agreement for
the sale of a property which is, for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52(i)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, a Commonwealth place.  That contention was opposed by the
Solicitor General for New South Wales, appearing on behalf of the plaintiff.
In order to solve a possible procedural difficulty, the defendant applied with
the consent of the plaintiff and the Commonwealth
for leave to file a
cross-claim seeking a declaration that the contract for sale is not dutiable
under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a> by reason of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52(i)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.  I granted
leave accordingly.  The cross-claim separately identifies and articulates a
matter arising under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> or involving its interpretation.  The
thinking behind the cross-claim is that if there is an appeal from my
determination of the
constitutional matter, the separate articulation of that
question in the cross-claim may be of some procedural assistance in identifying
the subject matter of, and the proper parties to, the appeal.
<P>

7  	The constitutional matter was the subject of full submissions at
the hearing on 19 August 1999.  The second matter, with respect
to the solvency
of the defendant, was not fully heard at that time, but the defendant sought
leave to file in Court and rely upon
some additional affidavit evidence with
respect to its solvency.  I decided, after argument, to grant that leave
subject to an appropriate
order as to costs, and subsequently the plaintiff
sought an adjournment so that he could consider whether to reply to the new
evidence.
 I granted an adjournment to a date to be fixed and stood the matter
over for the making of directions as to the filing of affidavits,
in the event
that the second matter still needed to be determined after I had reached a
conclusion as to the constitutional matter.
<P>

8  	I have not made any order under Part 31 of the Supreme Court
Rules for the resolution of the constitutional matter as a separate
question.
Although the possibility of my doing so was canvassed before the first hearing
in December 1998, in the end neither party
applied for such an order.  I would
be concerned that a consequence of such an order would be to delay unduly the
determination of
the winding up summons, contrary to the public policy
reflected in s 459P of the Corporations Law, especially if there were to be
an
appeal on the separate question.
<P>

<b>Section 52(i) - Commonwealth's exclusive legislative power with respect to
Commonwealth places</b>
<P>

9  	For relevant purposes, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52(i)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> states:
<P>

`The Parliament shall, subject to this <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, have exclusive power to
make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with
respect to - 
<P>

(i)	... all places acquired by the Commonwealth for public purposes'.
<P>

10  	Before the High Court decided <i>Worthing v Rowell &amp; Muston
Pty Ltd</i> (1970) 123 CLR 89, the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52(i)</a> was unclear.  There was a
considerable body of opinion to the effect that general State laws would apply
to a Commonwealth place
unless the Commonwealth were to enact legislation
specifically applying to the Commonwealth place and exhibiting an intention to
override the State laws:  see the summary in <i>Allders International Pty Ltd v
Commissioner of State Revenue (Vict) </i>(1996) 186 CLR 630, 667-8.  The
majority in <i>Worthing</i> held that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52(i)</a> excluded the power of a State
Parliament, even by a law of general application, to regulate the conduct of
persons engaged in activity
in a Commonwealth place:  see <i>Allders
International</i> at 668.  <i>Worthing</i> was confirmed and applied by the
High Court in <i>R v Phillips</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1970/50.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1970] HCA 50</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%20125%20CLR%2093" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 125 CLR 93.</a>
<P>

11  	Some implications of that decision were addressed by the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/" class="autolink_findacts">Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970</a> (Cth), which applied State
laws to Commonwealth places, but that Act did not apply any State law which had
`effect so as to impose
any tax' <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpola1970376/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 4(5)(a)).</a>  Consequently the Act did not
apply State stamp duty laws to Commonwealth places.  
<P>

12  	After it was decided in <i>Allders International </i> that s
52(i) prevented the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/sa1958103/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamps Act 1958</a> (Vict) from imposing stamp duty on a
certain lease of part of a Commonwealth place to a commercial entity, the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/" class="autolink_findacts">Commonwealth Places (Mirror Taxes) Act 1998</a> (Cth) (`Mirror Taxes Act') was
enacted.  Its purpose was to establish a structure under which certain applied
laws, including State
stamp duty legislation, would be applied with respect to
Commonwealth places, effective after a stated date.  However, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/" class="autolink_findacts">Mirror Taxes
Act</a> does not apply in the present case, for reasons which I shall explain later
in this judgment.
<P>

<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act 1920</a> (NSW)</b>
<P>

13  	The facts of the present case occurred prior to the commencement
on 1 July 1998 of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/da199793/" class="autolink_findacts">Duties Act 1997</a> (NSW).  Consequently stamp duty was
payable, if at all, under the 1920 Act, as amended.  By s 4 of that Act duty
was charged in respect
of the instruments and matters described in the Act and
in the Second Schedule.  The relevant matters for present purposes are those
dealt with in ss 41 and 66 and in the Second Schedule (the item `Agreement for
the Sale or Conveyance (Including Exchange) of any
Property', and paragraph (1)
of the item `Conveyances of Any Property').  The main provisions are as
follows:
<P>

41(1) Every agreement for the sale or conveyance of any property in New South
Wales shall be charged with the same ad valorem duty
to be paid by the
purchaser or any person to whom the property is agreed to be conveyed as if it
were a conveyance of the property
agreed to be sold or conveyed and shall be
stamped accordingly.  
<P>

66(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act every conveyance is to be charged
with ad valorem duty in respect of the unencumbered
value of the property
thereby conveyed.  
<P>

66(2)(a) A conveyance on sale of any property is to be charged with ad valorem
duty on the amount or value of the consideration
for the sale.  
<P>

Second Schedule: 
<P>

 [ IMAGE ] 
<P>

14  	Section 41(1) applies to `any property in New South Wales'.
Section 66 and the relevant Second Schedule provision apply to
a `conveyance',
defined in s 65 to include a transfer whereby `any property in New South Wales'
is transferred to any person.  A
proprietary interest in land is situated where
the land is located:  <i>Haque v Haque (No.2) </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1965/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1965] HCA 38</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281965%29%20114%20CLR%2098" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1965) 114 CLR 98</a>;
<i>Westland Shopping Centre (Vic) Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Qld)</i>
(1983) 83 ATC 4521.  Land in New South Wales which has been acquired by the
Commonwealth for public purposes is nevertheless property
in New South Wales
for the purposes of s 41(1), assuming that the land has not become part of a
Commonwealth Territory. 
<P>

15  	The `person primarily liable' was defined in s 3 to mean the
person so specified in the Second Schedule.  In the present case,
the person so
specified is the purchaser, the defendant.  Although the purchaser was the
person `primarily liable', the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a> does not impose any general
secondary liability:  see D G Hill, <i>Stamp Duties </i>(LBC Information
Services, looseleaf), para 1.160.
<P>

16  	By <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 25</a> the person primarily liable with respect to an
instrument was required to cause it to be duly stamped.  Thus, the statutory
obligation
to stamp the contract of sale and conveyance was imposed on the
defendant as purchaser and not on the Commonwealth as vendor.  Failure
to cause
the instrument to be stamped was an offence and a penalty could be payable
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 25(1A).</a>  In addition, the Chief Commissioner had the power to make a
default assessment against the person required to cause the instrument
to be
stamped, under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s127b.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 127B.</a>  But there were no provisions which permitted the Chief
Commissioner to require the vendor in a sale of land to pay the stamp duty
assessed on the contract or conveyance.  
<P>

17  	The person primarily liable was required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 25</a> to cause a
dutiable instrument to be duly stamped within six months after it was first
executed, and if the instrument was not duly
stamped within two months after it
was first executed, a fine would be payable.  `First execution' was explained
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 26</a>, according to which an instrument was deemed to be first executed the
first time it was signed by any party thereto, but a contract
made by
acceptance of an offer contained in an instrument was deemed to be first
executed when the offer is accepted.  
<P>

18  	The person primarily liable with respect to an instrument was
personally liable to the Crown for payment of the duty immediately
upon first
execution, and could be sued for the amount of duty as for a debt due to the
Crown:  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 38(1).</a>
<P>

19  	Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s29.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 29(1)</a> an instrument executed in New South Wales or
relating to property situated in New South Wales could not be admitted into
evidence
in civil proceedings unless it was duly stamped.  However, if the
instrument was tendered as evidence on behalf of a party other
than the person
primarily liable to duty, it could be admitted into evidence if the court was
satisfied that the party tendering
it would inform the Chief Commissioner of
the name of the person primarily liable to duty and would lodge a copy of the
instrument
with the Chief Commissioner:  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s29.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 29(4).</a>  The latter provision had the
effect that the vendor of land, not being the person primarily liable to duty,
could tender the contract
or memorandum of transfer in evidence even though it
has not been stamped, provided that the vendor was able to inform the Chief
Commissioner of the purchaser's name and give the Chief Commissioner a copy of
the contract and memorandum of transfer.

9.	There is no arrangement in operation between the Governor of New South Wales
and the Governor-General under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 9</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/" class="autolink_findacts">Commonwealth Places (Mirror Taxes)
Act 1998</a> (Cth) in relation to the State of New South Wales.'
<P>

<b>Submissions by the Commonwealth which are not contested by the
plaintiff</b>
<P>

21  	The plaintiff has not contested three of the Commonwealth's
written submissions on matters of law.  I shall set out the matters
not
contested by the plaintiff and in each case, state my opinion on the law.  The
uncontested submissions relate to whether the
Elizabeth Bay property was at
relevant times a Commonwealth place, whether the making of the contract of sale
and settlement of the
sale caused the Elizabeth Bay property to cease to be a
Commonwealth place, and whether the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/" class="autolink_findacts">Mirror Taxes Act</a> has any application in the
present case.
<P>

<b>A place acquired by the Commonwealth for public purposes</b>
<P>

22  	Having regard to the agreed facts, the Commonwealth submitted
that the Elizabeth Bay property was, at the time of sale and
transfer to the
defendant, a place acquired by the Commonwealth for public purposes within s
52(i) (`a Commonwealth place').  The
plaintiff did not contest this conclusion.

<P>

23  	It is clear from the agreed facts that the Elizabeth Bay
property was acquired for public purposes, namely the purposes of
the Navy.

<P>

24  	A principle which emerges from <i>Allders International </i>(186
CLR at 675 per McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ) is that once land has been acquired
by the Commonwealth for public purposes, it is
subject to the exclusive
legislative power conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> as long as it remains
`in the ownership or possession of the Commonwealth'.  In <i>Worthing</i> (123
CLR at 124-5) Windeyer J said that the expression `places acquired by the
Commonwealth' means places which, upon acquisition,
the Commonwealth holds by
virtue of a proprietary right or interest.  
<P>

25  	The Elizabeth Bay property remained in the possession of the
Commonwealth until completion of the sale on 30 January 1998,
and the
Commonwealth remained the legal owner until registration of the transfer on 4
February 1998.  It was therefore a Commonwealth
place for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
52(i)</a> until at least 30 January 1998 and perhaps until 4 February 1998.  There
is an issue as to whether the creation of an equitable interest
in the
defendant as purchaser under the contract for sale affected this conclusion,
which is the subject of another concession by
the plaintiff to which I shall
now turn.  
<P>

<b>Commonwealth place - the effect of the contract of sale and the settlement
of the sale</b>
<P>

26  	The plaintiff did not contest the proposition that Commonwealth
land acquired for public purposes remains a Commonwealth place
for at least as
long as the Commonwealth retains legal title to the land;  nor the proposition
that the acquisition by a non-Commonwealth
entity of an equitable interest
under a contract of sale of the land does not entail that the land ceases to be
a Commonwealth place.
 I agree with the second of these two propositions, but I
find it unnecessary to decide whether the first is true as a categorical
proposition.  I wish to explain my opinion on this matter.  
<P>

27  	The constitutional reference to places `acquired by the
Commonwealth' expressly identifies an event (namely the acquisition)
and
impliedly identifies a state of affairs.  The implied state of affairs was
identified in <i>Allders International </i>(186 CLR at 675) as ownership or
possession by the Commonwealth, and by Windeyer J in <i>Worthing </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=123%20CLR%20124%2d5" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(123 CLR
124-5)</a> as the Commonwealth's holding of a proprietary interest.  Whatever
precisely it may be, the implied state of affairs arises because
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52(i)</a> cannot
have been intended to confer exclusive legislative power on the Commonwealth
with respect to a place which had once been acquired,
but was later disposed
of, by the Commonwealth.  This proposition is consistent with the propositions
accepted in <i>Attorney-General for New South Wales v Stocks and Holdings
(Constructors) Pty Ltd </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1970/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1970] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281970%29%20124%20CLR%20262" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1970) 124 CLR 262</a>, to the effect that:
<P>

&#183;	a State law will never apply to a place which was a Commonwealth place
when the State law was enacted, even if the place
is later disposed of by the
Commonwealth;  but
<P>

&#183;	after the disposal by the Commonwealth the State is free to legislate
with respect to the place.
<P>

28  	If the Commonwealth enters into a transaction which changes the
legal character of its interest in the place which it has acquired,
the place
may nevertheless continue to be a Commonwealth place for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
52(i).</a>  For example, the land at Tullamarine Airport was acquired by the
Commonwealth in 1961, and was subsequently vested in the Federal
Airports
Corporation on 1 January 1988 by virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/faca1986306/s23.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 23(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/faca1986306/" class="autolink_findacts">Federal Airports
Corporation Act 1986</a> (Cth), and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/faca1986306/s29.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 29(1)</a> of that Act provided that a place owned
by the Corporation as a Federal airport is held by the Corporation for and on
behalf of the
Commonwealth.  In <i>Allders International </i>(186 CLR at 675)
it was held that that although the character of the Commonwealth's interest in
the airport changed in 1988, the airport
had retained its status as a
Commonwealth place for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/faca1986306/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52(i).</a>  
<P>

29  	Did the changes in the character of the Commonwealth's ownership
of the property at Elizabeth Bay prior to registration of
the transfer on 4
February 1998 cause the property to cease to be a Commonwealth place for the
purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/faca1986306/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52(i)?</a>  There were two relevant changes in the character of the
Commonwealth's ownership, occurring (respectively) by virtue of the making
of
the contract of sale and the subsequent settlement of the sale.  
<P>

30  	By entering into the contract of sale on 5 September 1997, the
defendant acquired an equitable interest (<i>Lysaght v Edwards </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%202%20Ch%20D%20499" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 2 Ch
D 499</a>, 506-7), although the `value' of an equitable interest acquired in such
circumstances is commensurate only with the amount of purchase
price paid:  see
<i>Haque v Haque (No.2) </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1965/38.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1965] HCA 38</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281965%29%20114%20CLR%2098" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1965) 114 CLR 98</a>, 124;  <i>KLDE Pty Ltd v
Commissioner of Stamp Duties </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1984/63.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1984] HCA 63</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%20155%20CLR%20288" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 155 CLR 288</a>, 296-97;  <i>Mt Newman
Mining Co Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Taxation </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2011%20WAR%20413" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 11 WAR 413</a>,
418-19.  The existence of the purchaser's equitable interest does not imply
that the vendor is a mere trustee once the contract
for sale is entered into.
The position was well summarised by Stamp LJ in <i>Berkley v Poulett </i><a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1976/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] EWCA Civ 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1977%5d%201%20EGLR%2086" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1977]
1 EGLR 86</a>, 93:
<P>

`But to say that it is the duty of the vendor <i>as trustee for the
purchaser</i> to care for the property is to put the cart before the horse and
may lead you into error.  He is said to be a trustee because of
the duties
which he has, and the duties do not arise because he is a trustee but because
he has agreed to sell the land to the purchaser
and the purchaser on tendering
the price is entitled to have the contract specifically performed according to
its terms.  Nor does
the relationship in the meantime have all the incidents of
the relationship of trustee and cestui que trust.  That this is so is
sufficiently illustrated by the fact that <i>prima facie</i> the vendor is
until the date fixed for the completion entitled to receive and retain the
rents and profits and that as from date
the purchaser is bound to pay
interest.'
<P>

31  	In my opinion the property remained a Commonwealth place for the
purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/faca1986306/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52(i)</a> after 5 September 1997 notwithstanding the contract of that
date.  After the date of the contract the Commonwealth retained legal
title to
and possession of the property, and could not be characterised as merely a
trustee for the reasons given by Stamp LJ.  The
purchaser's equitable interest
depended on the validity and enforceability of the contract, and would
evaporate if the contract were
to be validly rescinded.  The matter may be
tested this way:  if, after the date of the contract, the Commonwealth had
entered into
a short-term lease of the property for a rental calculated
similarly to the rental in <i>Allders International</i>, it cannot plausibly be
suggested that the High Court's decision in that case would be rendered
inapplicable simply because of the
existence of the contract of sale.
<P>

32  	It is accepted in Australian law that when the purchaser of land
has paid the purchase money, the vendor becomes a constructive
trustee of the
property sold:  <i>Chang v Registrar of Titles</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1976/1.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1976] HCA 1</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281976%29%20137%20CLR%20177" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1976) 137 CLR 177</a>, 185 per
Mason J and 189 per Jacobs J;  see also <i>Shaw v Foster</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281872%29%20LR%205%20HL%20321" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1872) LR 5 HL
321.</a>  There might be an issue, notwithstanding the plaintiff's concession, as
to whether a property under Torrens title which the Commonwealth
has sold
remains a Commonwealth place during the period between settlement of the sale
and registration of the transfer.  However,
in my opinion that issue does not
arise for determination in the present case.  
<P>

33  	In the present case the question is whether the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a>
of New South Wales encroaches upon the exclusive legislative power of the
Commonwealth under s 52(i).  To the extent that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a> imposed
stamp duty on the contract for sale, it did so at a point no later than the
time of exchange of contracts.  The agreement
for sale was charged with ad
valorem duty by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 4</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">41</a>; the contract was required to be duly stamped
within a stated time after it was first executed <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 25)</a>;  the liability to pay
the duty, recoverable as a debt, arose on first execution <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 38)</a>;  and first
execution occurred no later than when the offer contained in a signed contract
was accepted upon exchange of contracts
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 26).</a>  At the point of exchange of
contracts for the Elizabeth Bay property, it was clear for the reasons already
indicated that the property
was a Commonwealth place.  
<P>

34  	The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a> also created a liability to pay duty with
respect to the memorandum of transfer which was executed on behalf of the
Commonwealth
and the defendant prior to the settlement and handed over in
exchange for the balance of purchase money when settlement occurred
on 30
January 1998.  As with the contract, the requirement to cause the duty to be
paid under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 25</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">26</a>, and liability to pay the duty under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 38</a>, arose at the
point of first execution, defined on this occasion as the first time that the
memorandum of transfer was signed by
any party thereto.  Under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 41(4)(a)</a> a
memorandum of transfer made in conformity with an agreement for sale was
chargeable with duty of $2 rather than with ad valorem
duty, provided that duty
had been duly paid on the agreement for sale as required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 41.</a>  In the
present case duty had not been paid on the agreement for sale and consequently
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a> would, if valid, charge the memorandum of transfer to ad
valorem duty on the amount or value of the consideration for the sale, by
virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 4</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">66</a>(2) and Second Schedule (item `Conveyances of any
Property', paragraph (1)).  As the charge to duty arose upon first execution of
the memorandum of transfer as a conveyance, an event which occurred prior to
the payment of the consideration for the sale on 30
January 1998, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp
Duties Act</a> purported to impose a liability to pay duty at a time before the
Commonwealth became a constructive trustee by receipt of the purpose
money on
30 January 1998.  For the reasons already given the Elizabeth Bay property
remained a Commonwealth place in the period from
exchange of contracts to
settlement, whatever effect the settlement of the sale may have had on the
property's status as a Commonwealth
place.
<P>

35  	I therefore conclude that the Elizabeth Bay property was a
Commonwealth place at the times when the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a> purported to impose
the obligations to pay stamp duty on the relevant instruments, namely the time
of first execution of the contract
of sale and memorandum of transfer
respectively.
<P>

<b>Inapplicability of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/" class="autolink_findacts">Mirror Taxes Act</a></b>
<P>

36  	The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/" class="autolink_findacts">Mirror Taxes Act</a> relates to `excluded provisions', defined
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a> as provisions of State taxing laws (including specified stamp duty laws)
to the extent that their application to a Commonwealth place
is excluded by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
52(i)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 6</a> states, subject to qualifications, that
the excluded provisions of a State taxing law apply, and are taken to have
applied at relevant
times, to Commonwealth places.  However, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> provides that
these `applied laws' do not have effect in relation to any amount which would
have become due for payment before 6
October 1997 under the applied law.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 7</a> also requires an assumption that obligations which arose before 6
October 1997 have been fully and promptly complied with.  The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/" class="autolink_findacts">Mirror Taxes Act</a>
has no application to the present case for at least two reasons.
<P>

37  	The first reason relates to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 9</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/" class="autolink_findacts">Mirror Taxes Act</a>.  At the
initial hearing of this matter in December 1998 the parties made submissions on
the assumption that arrangements had been
made between the Governor-General of
the Commonwealth and the Governor of New South Wales under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 9</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/" class="autolink_findacts">Mirror
Taxes Act</a>.  Unless such arrangements are made, the curative provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a>
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/" class="autolink_findacts">Mirror Taxes Act</a> do not have effect (see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6(6)).</a>  My judgment of 4
February 1999 reflected that assumption.  However it is now an agreed fact that
there is no arrangement in operation
between the Commonwealth and New South
Wales for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 9.</a>  Therefore, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/" class="autolink_findacts">Mirror Taxes Act</a> does not
have any effect in relation to Commonwealth places in New South Wales.  
<P>

38  	The second reason relates to the date of commencement of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/" class="autolink_findacts">Mirror Taxes Act</a>.  The Commonwealth submitted that even if the arrangements
required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 9</a> had been in place, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/" class="autolink_findacts">Mirror Taxes Act</a> would not have operated
to impose stamp duty on the contract for sale of the Elizabeth Bay property.
The plaintiff did not contest
this submission.  By virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 4</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">25</a>, 26 and
41 of, and the Second Schedule to, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a>, ad valorem duty under
the contract of sale in this case became due for payment by no later than 5
September 1997 when counterparts
of the contract of sale were exchanged.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 7</a> (if otherwise applicable) would have required an assumption to be
made that the defendant's obligation to pay duty, which arose before
6 October
1997, had been fully and promptly complied with.  The memorandum of transfer
made after 6 October 1997 would have been
dutiable by virtue of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/" class="autolink_findacts">Mirror
Taxes Act</a> (had it otherwise applied), but by virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 7</a> the transfer would
be treated as made in conformity with an agreement upon which ad valorem stamp
duty had been paid, and hence under
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 41(4)(a)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a> the duty
on the transfer would have been a nominal duty of $2.
<P>

39  	The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/" class="autolink_findacts">Mirror Taxes Act</a> is an exercise of the exclusive legislative
power conferred upon the Commonwealth Parliament by s 52(i) with respect to
Commonwealth
places, a power which has been described as `plenary':  <i>Allders
International </i>at 679 per McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ.  But the Act applies,
consistently with that source of constitutional power, only where the
direct
application of a State taxing law is excluded by s 52(i) (see definition of
`excluded provisions' in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 6(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/" class="autolink_findacts">Mirror Taxes Act</a>).  If the transaction
in the present case is protected from the direct application of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp
Duties Act</a> of New South Wales by s 52(i), it will not be rendered dutiable ad
valorem by virtue of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cpta1998350/" class="autolink_findacts">Mirror Taxes Act</a>, because the contract was made before

Conversely, if the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a> were to apply directly with respect to the
transaction in the present case notwithstanding s 52(i), stamp duty would be

not purport to apply unless State law is excluded by s 52(i).

<b>Laws of the Commonwealth `with respect to' a Commonwealth place</b>
<P>

40  	Having regard to the agreed facts and the uncontested
submissions of the Commonwealth to the extent that I have accepted them,
the
crucial issue is whether the provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act 1920</a> (NSW) in
their application to the Elizabeth Bay property should be regarded as intruding
upon the Commonwealth's exclusive power
to make laws for the peace, order, and
good government `of the Commonwealth with respect to'<i> </i>a Commonwealth
place, in the sense in which the quoted words are used in s 52(i).  With the
support of the defendant, the Solicitor
General for the Commonwealth has put
forward three crucial propositions each of which has been contested by the
plaintiff.  The propositions
are as follows:
<P>

(1)	a law that affects a Commonwealth place in a real and tangible way, or that
has a direct, practical and real connection with
a Commonwealth place, will be
a law `with respect to' that place within the meaning of s 52(i);
<P>

(2)	upon that principle, provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act 1920</a> (NSW), to the
extent that they apply to a conveyance or an agreement for the sale or
conveyance of a Commonwealth place, are laws
with respect to that Commonwealth
place for the purposes of s 52(i);
<P>

(3)	to the extent that provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act 1920</a> (NSW) are laws
with respect to a Commonwealth place, they are outside the legislative
competence of the New South Wales Parliament.
<P>

In my opinion these three propositions are accurate, though in a summary way,
and their application means that the amount claimed
by the plaintiff for stamp
duty and fines is not a debt due and payable by the defendant.  I shall set out
my reasons for reaching
these conclusions.
<P>

41  	It has been observed that a power to make laws `with respect to'
a specific subject is as wide a legislative power as can be
created:  <i>Bank

Even so, there must be some degree of connection between the impugned State law
and a Commonwealth
place.  The High Court considered the requisite degree of
connection in a stamp duty context in the <i>Allders International </i>case.
<P>

<b>The <i>Allders International </i>case</b>
<P>

42  	The Commonwealth and the defendant rely on the <i>Allders
International</i> case, 186 CLR 630.  In that case the High Court held by
majority (Brennan CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ, Toohey and Dawson
JJ dissenting) that a lease of a duty free shop at Tullamarine Airport was not
dutiable under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/sa1958103/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamps Act 1958</a> (Vict) by reason of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52(i)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.  The dissenting judgments of Toohey and Dawson JJ were
inconsistent with the majority judgments on important points of principle
and
do not, in my opinion, reflect the present law.
<P>

43  	The land at Tullamarine Airport was acquired by the Commonwealth
in 1961, and pursuant to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/faca1986306/" class="autolink_findacts">Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986</a> (Cth) the
land was transferred in 1988 to the Federal Airports Corporation, which
according to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/faca1986306/s29.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 29(1)</a> of that Act held the land `for and on behalf of the
Commonwealth'.  The Commonwealth granted a lease to the appellant, a private
corporation, for a term of eight years from 1 November 1992.  Though for a term
in excess of three years, it was not registered under
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/tola1958160/" class="autolink_findacts">Transfer of Land Act
1958</a> (Vict).  The rent reserved was a fixed sum of $12 per annum (if demanded)
plus a variable component calculated according to formulae,
the factors of
which included the number of inbound and outbound international passengers and
the average levels of their expenditure
on goods to be sold by the lessee.  
<P>

44  	The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/sa1958103/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamps Act</a> imposed a duty on an instrument of lease,
assessed ad valorem on the amount of rent.  In a case where the rent could not
be ascertained
at the time of execution of the lease, the stamp duty was to be
based on an estimate which would be recalculated on an annual basis.
 Thus in
the <i>Allders International </i>case, the amount of duty eventually payable on
the instrument of lease would depend upon the amount of rent in fact paid,
which in
turn would depend upon factors which included the number of passengers
at the airport and their expenditure at the shop.  
<P>

45  	The majority judgments were a judgment of Brennan CJ and a joint
judgment of McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ.  Gaudron J agreed
with their joint
judgment, on the basis (contrary to her view) that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52(i)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>
is primarily a grant of legislative power rather than a provision primarily
concerned with the exclusivity of powers found elsewhere
in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>
(at 662). 
<P>

<b>Brennan CJ's judgment</b>
<P>

46  	Brennan CJ (at 642) took the view that if the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/sa1958103/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamps Act</a>, by
imposing stamp duty on the instrument of lease, placed a tax on the
Commonwealth's disposition of a leasehold estate or upon
the lessee's use of
the premises, it would be invalidated by s 52(i);  but if the connection
between the tax and the transaction
and use of the premises was so tenuous and
distant that the Act could not be characterised as a law with respect to the
airport or
the demised premises, it would be valid and applicable to the lease.
The characterisation of the tax by reference to these criteria
was to be
determined as a matter of substance rather than form.  His Honour concluded
that although the stamp duty was a tax upon
the instrument, the `substantial
effect' of the tax was to burden the transaction which the instrument of lease
was expressed to
effect (at 643).  He said it was impossible in any practical
sense to separate the instrument from any effect which it was expressed
to
produce and in fact produced, since if the instrument failed to take effect as
a lease because of lack of registration, it would
have taken effect as an
agreement for lease and would have been chargeable to the same duty (at 643).
The State law thus operated
on the transaction by which the Commonwealth
demised or disposed of an interest in premises which were part of a
Commonwealth place.
 A hypothetical Commonwealth law imposing tax on the
creation of a leasehold interest in land within a Commonwealth place would have
a direct and close connection with that place, and would be valid under s
52(i).  The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/sa1958103/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamps Act</a> applied to a transaction affecting the ownership of
proprietary interests in a Commonwealth place, because stamp duty under that
Act purported to burden the demise or disposition of an interest in premises
within a Commonwealth place (at 644).  It therefore
intruded upon the field of
exclusive Commonwealth legislative power under s 52(i).
<P>

47  	Brennan CJ's reasoning did not depend upon the fact that in the
case before him, rent and therefore stamp duty varied according
to the number
of passengers and their level of expenditure in the shop, for he said that
stamp duty would remain a burden on the
demise or the disposition of an
interest effected by the dutiable instrument even if the amount of duty had
been calculable finally
upon execution of the lease (at 644).  He rejected the
view that detriment to the Commonwealth is an essential criterion for
determining
whether a State law is invalidated by s 52(i), and therefore it did
not matter to him that the tax was payable only by the lessee
and not by the
Commonwealth.  It was enough that the tax burdened the demise or disposition,
even if it did not burden the Commonwealth's
use of a Commonwealth place (at
644).
<P>

48  	Brennan CJ's reasoning was concerned with a lease rather than a
sale and conveyance of property.  Though he twice referred
(at 644) to a demise
or `the disposition of an interest', suggesting reasoning wide enough to cover
a sale and conveyance, in my
opinion his reference to the disposition of an
interest was to the Commonwealth's disposition of an equitable leasehold
interest
which, he said, was burdened by stamp duty imposed upon the instrument
by which the disposition was effected (see 643).  Nevertheless,
the extension
of Brennan CJ's reasoning from its leasehold context to a contract for sale and
memorandum of transfer of land is not
a large one.  
<P>

49  	A contract for the sale of land, being specifically enforceable,
confers an equitable interest upon the purchaser, and a memorandum
of transfer
of land for valuable consideration is specifically enforceable as an agreement
to transfer.  Thus there is a close connection
between these instruments and
the transactions which underlie them.  By imposing stamp duty on a contract for
sale and its related
memorandum of transfer, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act 1920</a> (NSW)
burdens the transaction which the contract and conveyance are expressed to
effect, namely the sale and disposition of the vendor's
entire legal and
equitable interest in the subject property.  The stamp duty burdens the
transaction because the instruments which
are taxed are expressed to produce
the effect that the disposition occurs.  The assessment of the duty is based
upon the amount of
consideration for the sale or the unencumbered value of the
property thereby conveyed.  Therefore the State law in substance `operates
on'
the disposition of the property, which is a Commonwealth place (see at 643).

<P>

50  	A Commonwealth law taxing a contract for the sale of a
Commonwealth place or a conveyance of the place upon sale would have
a direct
and close connection with the Commonwealth place, as the tax would burden the
disposition effected by the contract and conveyance,
and consequently such a
law would fall within the grant of exclusive legislative power contained in s
52(i).  The corollary, according
to Brennan CJ, is that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a> of
New South Wales, which imposes a tax on instruments which burdens the
disposition of a Commonwealth place effected by instruments,
intrudes upon and
is therefore invalidated by s 52(i).  
<P>

51  	My conclusion is that if Brennan CJ's approach correctly states
the law, it is reasonably clear that the submissions of the
Commonwealth and
the defendant should succeed in the present case.
<P>

<b>The joint judgment of McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ</b>
<P>

52  	The judgment of McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ, which was supported
by Gaudron J, expresses the relevant legal principles somewhat
differently from
Brennan CJ's judgment.  The application of their reasoning to the present case
is less clear cut than the application
of Brennan CJ's reasoning.
<P>

53  	For their Honours the test which fixes the boundary of the
Commonwealth's exclusive legislative power requires characterisation
of the
State law and consideration of whether, so characterised, it is a law `with
respect to' the Commonwealth place (at 670). 
A State law may be `with respect
to' a Commonwealth place even though it is a law of general application (at
668, 676).  A State
law with respect to a Commonwealth place cannot validly
apply to that place whether it was enacted before or after the Commonwealth
acquired the place (at 673).  
<P>

54  	In their Honours' view, while stamp duty is charged upon an
instrument rather than a disposition or transaction, a stamp duty
law may
affect both instruments and places.  A useful test is to ask whether the
Commonwealth Parliament could validly enact a law
similar to the impugned State
law and in the present case, there could be no doubt that a Commonwealth law
could impose a stamp duty
on an instrument of lease of land within a
Commonwealth place (at 676).  If, in reality and substance, a State stamp duty
law is
a law `with respect to' a Commonwealth place, s 52(i) cannot be avoided
by the device of designing the stamp duty as a tax upon instruments
(at 677).
Whatever its character for stamp duty purposes, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/sa1958103/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamps Act</a> concerned a part
of place acquired by the Commonwealth for public purposes, the connection being
not `tenuous or distant' but `direct,
practical and real', and affected the
airport as a Commonwealth place in a `real and tangible way' (at 677).
<P>

55  	It was relevant to this conclusion that under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/sa1958103/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamps Act</a>,
the amount of duty depended upon the amount of rent paid.  Similarly under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a> of New South Wales, the amount of ad valorem duty on a
contract for sale or conveyance varies depending upon the amount of the
consideration
payable or the unencumbered value of the property conveyed.
Additionally, their Honours drew attention to the fact that the amount
of rent,
and hence the amount of duty payable, was determined by reference to the extent
of the use of the Commonwealth place for
the public purpose for which it was
acquired (at 677).  This latter feature lead them to observe that the State law
imposed stamp
duty by reference to the extent of the use of and economic
activity at, part of the Commonwealth place.  
<P>

56  	It was unnecessary for their Honours to consider circumstances
such as those of the present case, where the duty is fixed by
reference to a
characteristic of the Commonwealth place - namely its unencumbered value or the
price paid for it - but not by reference
to any factor concerning use of or any
economic activity at the Commonwealth place.  Nevertheless, the overall
approach of the joint
judgment suggests to my mind that the connection between
the State law and use of or economic activity at the Commonwealth place
was not
an essential ingredient of their Honours' reasoning.  The principle which the
joint judgment espouses is that one must identify
the true character of the
State law in `reality and substance', by assessing whether it affects the
Commonwealth place in a `real
and tangible way' rather than in a `tenuous or
distant' way.  
<P>

57  	A connection between stamp duty and use or economic activity
may, alone or in connection with other factors, supply the real
and tangible
connection which their Honours require, but the State law may be `with respect
to' a Commonwealth place even if the
connection does not relate to use or
economic activity.  Their Honours observed (at 678) that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/sa1958103/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamps Act</a>
supplied the requisite connection with a Commonwealth place by <i>varying the
duty in accordance with the rent.</i>  This was so, even if one were to apply
the approach of Walsh J in <i>Worthing </i>(123 CLR at 138-141) that a State
law intrudes upon the Commonwealth's domain only if it has `a direct and
substantial connection'
with the Commonwealth place, a view which their Honours
described as narrower than their own.  For present purposes, the significance
of this passage is that it was the relationship between the amount of the duty
and the amount of the rent which supplied the connection,
rather than the
relationship between the amount of duty and use or economic activity.  On that
reasoning, a State law which imposes
stamp duty on a contract of sale or
conveyance in an amount which varies depending upon the amount of consideration
or the unencumbered
value of the subject property has a direct and substantial
connection with that property.
<P>

58  	My conclusion is that the joint judgment adopts a principle
which is capable of applying in a case where the amount of stamp
duty is not
fixed by reference to use of or economic activity at a Commonwealth place.
While that principle does not dictate a solution
to the problem in the present
case, on balance it points in favour of the Commonwealth and defendant and
against the plaintiff. 
However, before expressing a conclusion about the
<i>Allders International </i>case I should advert to the plaintiff's detailed
written submissions which purport to distinguish it.
<P>

<b>The plaintiff's submissions on <i>Allders International</i></b>
<P>

59  	The plaintiff sought to distinguish the decision in <i>Allders
International</i>, and also sought to raise three issues of legal principle.  I
shall first deal with the grounds relied upon to distinguish the case,
and then
with the questions of principle.  The questions of principle relate to whether
the joint judgment's `useful test' is useful
after all;  whether the State law
must be detrimental to the Commonwealth;  and whether the State law must affect
the Commonwealth's
use of the place and the purpose of its acquisition.  
<P>

<b>Is <i>Allders International</i> distinguishable?</b>
<P>

60  	The plaintiff relies upon three points of distinction between
<i>Allders International</i> and the present facts.  
<P>

61  	First, the plaintiff pointed out that <i>Allders International
</i>concerned stamp duty payable on a lease, whereas the present case concerns
stamp duty payable on a contract for sale and a memorandum
of transfer.
However, it seems to me that Brennan CJ's judgment draws no relevant
distinction between a lease and a conveyance, since
in each case the instrument
upon which the tax is imposed burdens the transaction which the instruments
purport to effect.  While
part of the reasoning in the joint judgment is
confined to stamp duty on an instrument of lease where rent and consequently
duty
varied depending upon use and economic activity, my opinion is that the
principle of connection upon which their Honours relied is
broader and if
properly understood, would apply to a State law which imposes a tax on a
contract for sale and memorandum of transfer
with respect to a Commonwealth
place.
<P>

62  	Secondly, the plaintiff pointed out that the duty charged in
<i>Allders International </i>was imposed by reference to the estimated rent of
the premises, which in turn was affected by the extent of the use of the
airport
by passengers, and the duty was therefore directly referrable to the
extent of economic activity engaged in at the Commonwealth place.
 In the
present case, the plaintiff said, the duty charged is referrable only to the
consideration, being a consideration not less
than the unencumbered value of
the property.  However, in my opinion a law which imposes stamp duty in such
circumstances is appropriately
characterised as a law `with respect to' a
Commonwealth place, since the duty is imposed on instruments whose subject
matter is the
Commonwealth place, and the amount of the duty is related to the
unencumbered value of that place.  The amount of the duty would
be affected,
for example, by the value of improvements made by the Commonwealth to the
Commonwealth place.
<P>

63  	Thirdly, the plaintiff pointed out that in the present case
there has been a conveyance of the land from the Commonwealth to
a private
corporation, the defendant, and thus there has been a total divestiture of
Commonwealth ownership.  In <i>Allders International</i> there was, at all
material times, a continuance of Commonwealth ownership.  But in my opinion the
fact that the Commonwealth has
disposed of the property which, until disposed
of, was a Commonwealth place, does not entitle a State legislature to invade
the Commonwealth's
exclusive legislative domain by purporting to legislate with
respect to the place <i>prior to its disposal</i>.  I have pointed out that in
the present case, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a> purports to impose an obligation to
cause instruments to be stamped, and a liability to pay the assessed stamp
duty, at the time
of first execution <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">(ss 25</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">26</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">38</a>).  At the time of first
execution of the contract of sale and memorandum of transfer in this case, the
subject of those instruments
was a Commonwealth place, even though the process
of disposal of the Commonwealth place had been commenced and, indeed, those
instruments
(and the registration of the latter) were the means of effectuating
the disposition.  If the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a> had purported to operate only after
the disposal had occurred, its validity would have been beyond challenge
(subject only to the
principles in the <i>Stocks &amp; Holdings</i> case).  But
it expressly purported to apply before the disposition could be fully
effectuated, and therefore necessarily while the
subject of the instruments was
a Commonwealth place.
<P>

64  	My conclusion, therefore, is that none of these points,
separately or by their combined effect, distinguishes the majority
decision in
<i>Allders International</i>.
<P>

<b>The majority's `useful tests'</b>
<P>

65  	Section 52(i) vests exclusive legislative power in the
Commonwealth Parliament.  It does not, in terms, invalidate State laws.
However, the vesting of legislative power `exclusively' in the Commonwealth
implies that the State legislatures are incompetent to
invade that exclusive
legislative domain.  As Menzies J said in <i>Worthing</i> (123 CLR at 113) `the
denial is measured by the grant' (see also <i>Allders International</i>, 123
CLR at 638-640 per Brennan CJ, and at 669-670 per McHugh, Gummow and Kirby
JJ).
<P>

66  	If a legislative subject is `with respect to' a Commonwealth
place then it is capable of falling within the exclusive province
of the
Commonwealth Parliament under s 52(i), and a State law on that subject is
likewise capable of being invalidated by s 52(i).
 However, those consequences
will not follow unless the legislative subject falls within the remaining words
of s 52(i).  
<P>

67  	There are two possible limitations.  One is that the vesting of
exclusive power in s 52(i) is expressed to be `subject to this
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>'.
In <i>Allders International</i> it was argued that the exclusive power
conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52(i)</a> was subject to the express limitation imposed by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 51(ii)</a>,
namely that laws on taxation must not discriminate between States.  McHugh,
Gummow and Kirby JJ (at 678-680) rejected this argument,
finding that the power
to make laws under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> is plenary and separate from the concurrent powers
conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 51</a>, and consequently separate from the limitations on those
concurrent powers.  Brennan CJ (at 640) found it unnecessary to decide this
point.  He observed that if the Commonwealth's exclusive legislative power
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> is qualified by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 51(ii)</a>, the legislative power of the States is not
thereby enhanced.  Presumably the point is that, even if the Commonwealth
cannot enact
a discriminatory tax law under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a>, it nevertheless possesses
exclusive power to enact a tax law with respect to Commonwealth places, and
therefore the States are prevented
from enacting tax laws with respect to the
Commonwealth places, whether those laws are discriminatory or not.  
<P>

68  	The other possible limitation is that the exclusive power
conferred on the Commonwealth Parliament by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> is a power `to make laws for
the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth' with respect to the
stated matters.  Neither
Brennan CJ (at 639-640) nor McHugh, Gummow and Kirby
JJ (at 670) regarded the quoted words as qualifying the Commonwealth's
exclusive
power to legislate with respect to a Commonwealth place, or
permitting a State to pass a law with respect to a Commonwealth place
but not
for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth.  The majority
judges in <i>Allders International </i>relied exclusively on a test of
connection - if the legislative subject matter, realistically characterised, is
sufficiently connected
to the Commonwealth place that it is `with respect to'
the Commonwealth, then it falls within the Commonwealth's exclusive legislative
domain and a State law dealing with that subject matter is invalid to the
extent of the encroachment;  and conversely, a State law
on that subject matter
is invalid if, realistically characterised, it is sufficiently connected with a
Commonwealth place to be `with
respect to' that place.  Having reduced the
boundary between the Commonwealth and State laws to a question, in each case,
of the
sufficiency of the connection between the law and a Commonwealth place,
both Brennan CJ (at 644) and McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ
(at 676) reasoned that
the impugned State law would be invalid if a similar Commonwealth law would be
valid.  In the joint judgment
this was described as `useful test' (at 676).

<P>

69  	The plaintiff submitted, with due respect, that far from being
useful, this `test' is merely another way of articulating the
problem which is
to be solved.  With hesitation as well as respect, I am inclined to have
sympathy with this submission.  Once it
is accepted, as it appears to have been
by McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ, that the words `subject to this <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>'
and `laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth' do not
impose any qualification on the exclusive vesting
of power made by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a>, the
Commonwealth Parliament necessarily has exclusive legislative power under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a>
as long as the law is `with respect to' a Commonwealth place.  Conversely, a
State law will be invalid in its application to a Commonwealth
place, if that
law is `with respect to' the Commonwealth place.  Analytically, the question
about invalidity of the State law and
the question about validity of the
Commonwealth law raise the same issue, provided that the State law and the
hypothetical Commonwealth
law are not materially different.  
<P>

70  	Indeed, I wonder whether consideration of the validity of the
impugned State law by reference to a hypothetical Commonwealth
law may be
dangerous rather than merely unhelpful.  The danger is that in formulating the
hypothetical Commonwealth law, one might
inadvertently supply the connection
with the Commonwealth place which it was the purpose of the inquiry to test.
At the very least,
I must say that I have not found the `useful test' a helpful
means of answering the question which I must consider in this case,
since I am
not sure whether the hypothetical Commonwealth law is to be regarded as
confined to the Elizabeth Bay property, or applicable
to all Commonwealth
places, or applicable to property more generally.
<P>

<b>Detriment to the Commonwealth</b>
<P>

71  	The plaintiff observed that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a> of New South
Wales does not impose any form of duty to be paid other than by the purchaser
on agreements for sale or the conveyance
of any property.  The Act does not
impose liability upon the Commonwealth to pay any form of stamp duty as vendor.
Indeed, says the
plaintiff, the Act does not burden or cause detriment to the
Commonwealth in any way.  Hence the nexus is so tenuous or remote that
the Act
cannot be characterised as one with respect to a Commonwealth place.
<P>

72  	One might add that under s 29, although a contract of sale or
conveyance cannot be tendered in evidence unless stamp duty has
been paid, the
vendor's position is protected by s 29(4), and consequently the vendor cannot
be said to suffer any significant detriment
by virtue of the imposition and
non-payment of the duty.
<P>

73  	An argument to this effect was considered and rejected by
Brennan CJ in <i>Allders International</i> (186 CLR at 644).  In his view, the
question was not whether the stamp duty burdened the lessor but whether it
burdened the demise
(or the disposition of an interest).  It did so in that
case, and it does so here.  In his view, detriment to the Commonwealth is
not
an essential criterion for determining whether a State law is invalidated by s
52(i).  
<P>

74  	As the plaintiffs' submission notes, the other majority judges
in <i>Allders International</i> did not expressly consider this issue.
However, in my opinion, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ did not require detriment
to the Commonwealth
as an ingredient of the application of s 52(i).  Their
Honours referred to the lessee's obligation to pay stamp duty at 664, but
did
not regard it as significant.  For them the essential issue was whether there
was a sufficient connection between the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/sa1958103/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamps Act</a>, realistically
characterised, and the Commonwealth place.  In considering that issue, they did
not see fit to place emphasis on the
fact that stamp duty was payable by the
lessee and not by the Commonwealth.
<P>

75  	Indeed, it would be inconsistent with the actual decisions in
<i>Worthing </i>and <i>Phillips</i> to treat detriment to the Commonwealth as
an essential ingredient for the application of s 52(i).  Further, if it were
correct that
Commonwealth detriment is a necessary ingredient for the
invalidity of a State law under s 52(i), it would follow, highly implausibly,
that the Commonwealth's exclusive power to make laws under s 52(i) would be
limited to laws detrimental to the Commonwealth.
<P>

76  	I agree with the plaintiff that the question of Commonwealth
detriment is a relevant factor to take into account in deciding
whether there
is a sufficient nexus between the State law and the Commonwealth place.  By
this I mean that if the State law, having
regard to its `real and substantial
impact' (see 186 CLR at 677), operates to the detriment of the Commonwealth in
its ownership,
occupation or use of a Commonwealth place, that fact points to
the applicability of s 52(i).  However, s 52(i) may be applicable
in a case
where the operation of the State law does not lead to any such detriment, if
there are other connections between the State
law and the Commonwealth place
which are real and substantial enough that the State law should be regarded as
a law `with respect
to' the Commonwealth place.
<P>

77  	I should add that in my opinion, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a>, if it
applies to the contract for sale and memorandum of transfer of the Elizabeth
Bay property, would cause detriment to the Commonwealth
with respect to that
property.  Although there is no specific evidence on the point, it seems to me
incontestable that a purchaser
will pay a higher price if the acquisition can
be completed without liability to pay stamp duty.  Consequently the price which
the
Commonwealth can obtain for sale of a Commonwealth place in New South Wales
will be reduced, and consequently the Commonwealth will
suffer detriment, if
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a> of New South Wales can impose duty on the instruments of
sale and conveyance, even though the duty is payable by the purchaser rather
than the Commonwealth.  
<P>

<b>A State law unconnected with the Commonwealth's public purposes or use of
the Commonwealth place</b>
<P>

78  	In <i>Allders International</i> Brennan CJ (at 639) said that
the power which s 52(i) confers on the Commonwealth Parliament cannot logically
be confined to the
regulation of conduct and activities in and the use of a
Commonwealth place.  In his opinion, the power extends to the legislative
control of any act, matter or thing that occurs or exists within a relevant
locality (at 639).  On this reasoning, the required connection
between the
State law and a Commonwealth place need not relate to the purpose for which the
Commonwealth place was acquired or the
use of the Commonwealth place in pursuit
of that purpose.  
<P>

79  	However, there are some observations in the judgment of McHugh,
Gummow and Kirby JJ which, according to the plaintiff, point
in the opposite
direction.  Their Honours emphasised that the amount of duty payable under the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/sa1958103/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamps Act</a> depended upon the amount of rent payable under the instrument of
lease, which in turn depended upon a formula which had regard to
the number of
passengers and their expenditure (which they refer to as `economic activity' -
see 677-8).  That meant, as their Honours
pointed out, that the amount of stamp
duty was fixed by reference to the extent of use of the Commonwealth place for
the public purpose
for which it was acquired (at 677).  For reasons which I
have already given, I do not regard this part of their Honours' reasoning
as an
essential ingredient of the principle upon which their judgment was based.
When rejecting a submission that the exclusive power
conferred by s 52(i) was
limited by other parts of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> including <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 51(ii)</a>, their Honours
stressed that the power conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> is plenary (at 679), and their
reasoning implies that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52</a> is not confined to laws with respect to enumerated
subjects or purposes.  To hold otherwise would be inconsistent with <i>Worthing
</i>and <i>Phillips, </i>where the State laws which were held not to apply in
relation to a Commonwealth place had no connection with the purpose for which
the relevant land had been acquired.  
<P>

80  	In my opinion, therefore, it is irrelevant that in its
operation, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a> of New South Wales had no connection with the
Naval purposes for which the Elizabeth Bay property was acquired by the
Commonwealth,
and no connection with any continuing or even temporary use of
the property.  I reject the plaintiff's submission to the contrary.
<P>

<b>The effect of s 52(i) on the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act 1920</a> (NSW)</b>
<P>

81  	It follows, in my view, that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a> was invalid
under s 52(i) to the extent that it intruded upon the exclusive legislative
power of the Commonwealth with respect to
the Elizabeth Bay property as a
Commonwealth place.  It intruded on the Commonwealth's exclusive legislative
domain because it purported
to charge the contract for sale and memorandum of
transfer of that property to stamp duty while the property was a Commonwealth
place
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">(ss 4</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">41</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">66</a> and the Second Schedule);  and to impose an obligation on
the purchaser of the property from the Commonwealth to cause those instruments
to be stamped at the time of first execution of those instruments, at which
time the instruments were with respect to a Commonwealth
place <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">(ss 25</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">26</a>);
and to impose liability on the purchaser to pay that duty at the time of first
execution <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 38).</a>
<P>

82  	The plaintiff did not contend that these provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp
Duties Act</a>, though invalid with respect to the Elizabeth Bay property while it
remained a Commonwealth place, could spring into life upon registration
of the
transfer to impose obligations and liability upon the defendant as purchaser
thereafter.  Nevertheless such a submission might
be implied by or arise out of
the submission that the <i>Allders International</i> case was distinguishable
because Commonwealth ownership continued at all material times in that case,
whereas in the present case
the Commonwealth property has been conveyed away to
a private corporation.  I should therefore deal with this possibility.
<P>

83  	In my opinion the argument, though attractive at first blush, is
untenable.  Where it applies, s 52(i) invalidates a State
law to the extent
that it intrudes upon the Commonwealth's exclusive legislative domain
(<i>Allders International</i>, 186 CLR at 638 per Brennan CJ, 680 per McHugh,
Gummow and Kirby JJ).  It does not merely render the State law inoperative and
capable
of reviving automatically when the subject property ceases to be a
Commonwealth place.  
<P>

84  	The relevant provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a>, especially <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss
4</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">25</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">26</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">38</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">41</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">66</a> and the Second Schedule, purported to impose obligations
and liabilities with respect to the Elizabeth Bay property which were to
be
discharged and performed at times when that property was a Commonwealth place.
To the extent that they purported to do so, those
provisions were invalid.
While some of the relevant provisions relate to a state of affairs, namely that
certain instruments were
charged with duty <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s4.html" class="autolink_findacts">(ss 4</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s41.html" class="autolink_findacts">41</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">66</a> and the Second
Schedule), those provisions did not purport to have any different or revived
application after registration of the
transfer of a kind which might be severed
from the initial invalidity.  Other provisions <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">(ss 25</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s26.html" class="autolink_findacts">26</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s38.html" class="autolink_findacts">38</a>) imposed
continuing duties and liabilities but again, the terms of the provisions do not
suggest that registration of the transfer
affected or revived the obligations.

<P>

85  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s144.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 144</a> required that the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act</a> be read and
construed so as not to exceed the legislative power of the State, to the intent
that where any enactment would otherwise
have been construed as being in excess
of that power, it would nevertheless be a valid enactment to the extent that it
was not in
excess of that power.  In my opinion <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s144.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 144</a> cannot be used to
validate the imposition of stamp duty as from the registration of the transfer
in favour of the defendant, because
the relevant provisions of the Act
unambiguously purported to apply to create obligations and liabilities at times
when the Elizabeth
Bay property was a Commonwealth place, and therefore they
were wholly invalidated by s 52(i) to the extent that they purported apply
to
the Elizabeth Bay property as a Commonwealth place.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

86  	My conclusions are as follows:
<P>

(i)	the provisions of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act 1920</a> (NSW) are invalid by virtue of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 52(i)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> to the extent that they purport to impose stamp
duty on the contract for sale of the Elizabeth property dated 5 September 1997
and
the memorandum of transfer registered on 4 February 1998, and to create an
obligation to cause those instruments to be stamped and
a liability to pay
stamp duty on those instruments;
<P>

(ii)	consequently the defendant is not indebted to the plaintiff with respect
to the amount of stamp duty and fine claimed in the
statutory demand served by
the plaintiff on the defendant on 13 May 1998;
<P>

(iii)	further, the plaintiff is not, and was not at any relevant time, a
creditor of the defendant with respect to the amount of
stamp duty and fine
claimed with respect to the Elizabeth Bay property;
<P>

(iv)	the plaintiff therefore has no standing under s 459P of the Corporations
Law to apply to the Court for the defendant to be
wound up;
<P>

(v)	there being no application by any other creditor of the defendant to be
substituted as plaintiff in the winding up proceedings
under s 465B, the
winding up summons should be dismissed;
<P>

(vi)	the defendant as cross-claimant is entitled to the declaration sought in
the cross-claim dated 19 August 1999, namely a declaration
that the contract
for sale of land dated 5 September 1997 between the Commonwealth of Australia
as vendor and the defendant as purchaser
is not dutiable under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties
Act 1920</a> (NSW) by reason of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s52.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 52(i)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.
<P>

I shall hear submissions on the question of costs.
