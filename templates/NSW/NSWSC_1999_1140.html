<b>55014/99 	AUSTRALASIAN CONCRETE SERVICES PTY LTD v MULTIPLEX CONSTRUCTIONS
PTY LTD</b>
<P>

<b><u>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	On 20 August 1999 Rolfe J made an order pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ca1989154/index.html#p31" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 31</a>
r2 of the Supreme Court Rules (the Pt 31 order) for the separate determination
of the following questions (the separate questions):
<P>

"1.1Whether or not the plaintiff was a person required to have in force a
contract 		 of insurance in compliance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/index.html#p6" class="autolink_findacts">Part 6</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/" class="autolink_findacts">Home Building Act
1989</a> upon the entry    
<P>

        into of the Subcontract with the defendant dated 14 June 1997 the
subject of the 
<P>

        proceedings.
<P>

 
<P>

1.2	If the answer to 1.1 is `yes' then:
<P>

(a) 	Whether the plaintiff can reply on an estoppel as pleaded in the Reply
filed herein; or
<P>

(b)	Whether there was a waiver by the defendant as pleaded in the Reply filed
herein".
<P>

It will be seen that, having regard to my view as to the proper construction of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/s92.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 92</a> in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/index.html#p6" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 6</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/" class="autolink_findacts">Home Building Act 1989</a> (the Act), this question, as
formulated by the parties, involves a misconception of the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/index.html#p6" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 6</a> of
the Act.
<P>

2   	For the purposes of the determination of the separate
questions, the parties are agreed upon the following facts:
<P>

<b>"Agreed Statement of Facts for the Purposes of the Preliminary
Question</b>
<P>

1.	Sydney Park Developments Pty Limited and Sydney Park Pty Limited were at all
material times the joint owners of the land which
is the site of the townhouse
development known as 177-219 Mitchell Road, Alexandria and is comprised in Lot
B in Deposit Plan 416610
and Lot 3 in Deposited Plan 230024.  (Refer to the
Head Contract p.3 definition of  development land).
<P>

2.	Prior to 1 May 1997 (the date upon which <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/index.html#p6" class="autolink_findacts">Part 6</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/" class="autolink_findacts">Home Building Act
1989</a> NSW </i>came into effect) Multiplex:
<P>

(a) entered into contracts with Sydney Park Developments Pty Limited in respect
of demolition work and external work on the site,
which contracts are referred
to as `Early Works Agreement' and the `External Works Agreement'.  (Refer to
the Head Contract p.9 clause
4.3 and 4.4); and
<P>

(b)  commenced work on the project known as Sydney Park Village.
<P>

3.	On 9 April 1997 Multiplex,  as required by section 94(1)(a) of the Building
Services <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ca1989154/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporation Act 1989</a> paid to the Department of Fair Trading insurance
premiums totalling $122,430 being the prescribed insurance premium in respect
of
building work for units upon the site. 
<P>

4.	By Agreement dated 30 April 1997 between Multiplex and Sydney Park
Developments Pty Limited (the Head Contract) Multiplex agreed
to construct 371
units upon the site and  Sydney Park Developments Pty Limited agreed to pay
Multiplex $53,167,367 subject to the
terms of the Head Contract for the
performance of the work (Head Contract p. 64).  The agreement included the
performance of the
work required in the `Early Works Agreement' and the
`External Works Agreement'.
<P>

5.	Australasian Concrete Services Pty Limited (ACS) entered into a sub-contract
with Multiplex on or about 17 June 1997 to, inter
alia, supply and install
Rapidwall Panels on Stage 1 of the project (`<b>the Subcontract'</b>).
<P>

6.  The supply and installation of Rapidwall panels formed part of the head
contract works to be performed by Multiplex.
<P>

7.	Multiplex engaged in negotiations with ACS prior to the execution of the
Subcontract.  During the negotiations Multiplex did
not require ACS to take out
any insurance pursuant to or in compliance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/index.html#p6" class="autolink_findacts">Part 6</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/" class="autolink_findacts">Home Building
Act 1989</a> NSW </i> and the regulations appurtenant thereto.
<P>

8. The Multiplex subcontract required that ACS have in place and maintain
during the performance of the work policies of insurance,
including workers
compensation, public liability and contractors' risk insurance.  At no time
prior to or during the performance
of ACS' works did Multiplex require, direct
or demand ACS to effect any further insurances.
<P>

9.  Multiplex requested ACS to provide certificates of currency of policies of
insurance in compliance with the terms of the Subcontract,
as part of each
monthly progress claim submitted to Multiplex.
<P>

10. ACS provided to Multiplex with each monthly progress claim, certificates of
currency in respect of workers compensation and
public liability insurance
policies that the Subcontract had required ACS to effect.  Multiplex made
monthly progress payments to
ACS from July 1997 to about May 1998 on account of
the adjusted contract sum.  After the execution of the Variations Claims
Agreement
on 4 June 1998 Multiplex made payments to ACS fortnightly.  The
progress payments included monies for both Subcontract works performed
pursuant
to the Subcontract and variations to the Subcontract.  The quantum of some of
the payments made were disputed by ACS.
<P>

11. In September 1997 Multiplex issued  a variation to ACS for the supply and
erection of Rapidwall to Stage 2 of the project in
the amount of $1.5M.   At
the time of issuing this variation,  Multiplex did not require ACS to effect
any additional insurances
or further insurances other than those ACS were
required to provide pursuant to the Subcontract.
<P>

12. During 1998, disputes arose between Multiplex and ACS in respect of the
<P>

 entitlement of ACS to further adjustments to the Subcontract sum.
<P>

13. On 4 June 1998 Multiplex and ACS executed a document entitled
`Variations
<P>

Claims Agreement' whereby Multiplex agreed to pay amounts specified in the
agreement. 
<P>

14.  Multiplex, during the performance of the work:
<P>

(a)   paid ACS, as part of its progress payments, amounts in relation to a
<P>

number of variations which are the subject of the plaintiff's claim in these
proceedings; and  
<P>

(b)   paid, pursuant to the Variations Claims Agreement, amounts identified
in
<P>

the Variations Claims Agreement.
<P>

15.  Multiplex did not raise at any time prior to the commencement of these
proceedings:
<P>

(a)   The alleged requirement that ACS effect insurance under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/s92.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 92</a> of the
    
<P>

<i>       <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/" class="autolink_findacts">Home Building Act</a> </i> and the regulations appurtenant thereto;
<P>

(b)   Alleged non compliance by ACS with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/s92.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 92</a> of the <i>Home Building
</i>
<P>

       Act; 
<P>

(c)   the argument that it was not obliged to pay ACS any amounts in respect
of
<P>

       the subcontract or the work performed as a result of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/s94.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 94</a> of the
<i>Home      </i>
<P>

       <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ba91/" class="autolink_findacts">Building Act</a>.
<P>

16.  Had ACS been advised by Multiplex prior to, at the time, or subsequent
to,
<P>

 executing the Subcontract that:
<P>

(a)   ACS was required by Multiplex to take out a policy of insurance in
<P>

   compliance with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/index.html#p6" class="autolink_findacts">part 6</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/" class="autolink_findacts">Home Building Act</a>; </i>and/or
<P>

(b)   Multiplex would not make any payment to ACS under the Subcontract, on 
<P>

        account of contractual works and/or variations, unless and until
insurance
<P>

        complying with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/index.html#p6" class="autolink_findacts">part 6</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/" class="autolink_findacts">Home Building Act</a> </i> was in place,
<P>

ACS would have immediately taken steps to take out such insurance and, if   the
subcontract had already been entered into, would
have attempted to agree with
Multiplex to discharge the subcontract and to execute a new subcontract for the
remainder of the Subcontract
work.
<P>

17.  Neither party turned its mind to the application of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/index.html#p6" class="autolink_findacts">Part 6</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hba1989128/" class="autolink_findacts">Home
Building Act</a>
<P>

  to ACS until after the commencement of these proceedings.
<P>

18.  ACS, in performing the works, being the Subcontract works and variations,
relied    
<P>

       upon:
<P>

(a)   its Subcontract with Multiplex, as set out in paragraph 5 hereof;
<P>

(b)   Multiplex's conduct in making monthly progress payments to ACS from   
<P>

        July 1997 to about May 1998, and payments made pursuant to the    
<P>

        Variations Claims Agreement, as set out in paragraph 10 hereof;
<P>

(c)   Multiplex's conduct in not directing ACS to procure any further
insurances
<P>

  other than those required by the Subcontract."
<P>

3   	In the course of these reasons I have adopted some of the
terminology of the agreed facts.  In particular, "Multiplex" refers
to the
defendant;  "the head contract" refers to the contract between Multiplex and
Sydney Park Developments Pty Ltd of 30 April
1997 for the construction of 371
residential units and "the head contract works" refers to that work; "ACS"
refers to the plaintiff;
"the sub-contract" refers to the sub-contract between
ACS and Multiplex of 17 June 1997 for the performance of a portion of the head
contract works by ACS, namely, the supply and installation of wall panels, and
"the sub-contract works" refers to that sub-contract
work.
<P>

4   	The Act is, in substance, the amended form of the Building
Services <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ca1989154/" class="autolink_findacts">Corporation Act 1989</a> (the former Act), the amendment being effected by
the Building Services Corporation Legislation Amendment Act 1996 (the amending
Act).  
<P>

5   	The amending Act introduced significant changes to the
insurance provisions of the former Act in terms of Pt 6 of the Act.
 Those
provisions took effect in relation to residential building work "done or... to
be done... under a contract made on or after
[1 May 1997]", the day after the
head contract was entered into.  
<P>

6   	It is the contention of Multiplex that ACS entered into the
sub-contract in contravention of s 92 of the Act, which is in the
following
terms: 
<P>

<b>"92 Contract work must be insured</b>
<P>

(1) 	A person must not contract to do any residential building work unless a
contract of insurance that complies with this Act is
in force in relation to
the proposed work.
<P>

Maximum penalty: 100 penalty units.
<P>

(2) 	A person must not contract to do any residential building work unless a
certificate of insurance evidencing the contract of
insurance, in a form
prescribed by the regulations, is attached to the contract.
<P>

Maximum penalty: 100 penalty units.
<P>

(3)	This section does not apply if the contract price does not exceed $5,000 or
(if the contract price is not known) the reasonable
market cost of the labour
and materials involved does not exceed $5,000.
<P>

(4)	If the same parties enter into two or more contracts to carry out work in
stages, the contract price for the purposes  of subsection
(3) is taken to be
the sum of the contract prices under each of the contracts.
<P>

(5)	The regulations may prescribe another amount for the purposes of subsection
(3) and an amount so prescribed is to apply in the
place of the amount referred
to in that subsection."
<P>

Contravention of s 92(1) has the following further consequence under the
Act:
<P>

<b>"94   Effects on contract of contravention</b>
<P>

(1)  A person who enters into a contract in contravention of section 92(1) or
93 (1):
<P>

(a)   is not entitled to damages or to enforce any other remedy in respect of
a
<P>

breach of the contract committed by any other party to the contract or to
<P>

recover money in respect of work done under the contract under any other right
of action (including a quantum meruit action), but
<P>

(b)   is liable for damages and subject to any other remedy in respect of a
breach of the contract committed by the person."
<P>

7   	The thrust of Multiplex's contentions is that: Pt 6 of the
former Act applies to the head contract works, while Pt 6 of the
Act applies
concurrently to the sub-contract works.
<P>

8   	It is agreed that Multiplex complied with the insurance
provisions of the former Act by due payment of the prescribed premium.
 It is
common ground that there was no obligation upon ACS under the former Act to pay
any further premiums.
<P>

9   	If the argument of Multiplex is correct, it had no
obligation to comply with Pt 6 of the Act while of all of its sub-contractors,
who entered into a sub-contract on or after the commencement date of the Act,
had an obligation to insure pursuant to the provisions
of Pt 6 of the Act: on
any view of it, an absurd result and one to be avoided if the Act and the
amending Act is open to a construction
that leads to a more sensible result.

<P>

10   	S 102 of the Act provides as follows:
<P>

<b>"102   General requirements for insurance</b>
<P>

(1)  This section applies to all contracts of insurance required to be entered
into by or under this Part.
<P>

(2)  The insurance must be of a kind approved by the Minister and be provided
by an insurer approved by the Minister.
<P>

(3)  The contract of insurance must provide for cover of not less than
$200,000, or such other amount as may be prescribed by the
regulations, in
relation to each dwelling to which the insurance relates.
<P>

(4)  Any limitations on liability under the contract of insurance must comply
with any requirements of the regulations.
<P>

(5) The contract of insurance must comply with any other requirements of the
regulations.
<P>

(6)  A contract of insurance may provide that the insurer is not liable for
such amount (not exceeding $500) of each claim as is
specified in the
contract."
<P>

Presumably, that would mean, according to Multiplex's argument, that ACS, and
each of Multiplex's sub-contractors similarly affected,
had an obligation to
effect an insurance cover for not less than $200,000 in relation to each of the
371 units in the subject works,
or "such other amount as may be prescribed".
<P>

11   	It is noted that the s 94 point is taken after a period of
some sixteen months of construction work during which Multiplex
took advantage
of ACS's performance of the sub-contract, issued  instructions for a variation
in the amount of $1,500,000 and entered
into the Variations Claims Agreement
under which it agreed to make certain payments to ACS.  Clearly, as between
Multiplex and ACS,
there is no public interest consideration in holding the
sub-contract unenforceable against Multiplex by reason of the operation
of s 94
of the Act, and, if it is open to the court so to do, the Act should be
construed to preserve the enforceability of the sub-contract
against
Multiplex.
<P>

12   	Under the former Act the insurance regime was vastly
different from that prescribed under the Act.  The scheme under the former
Act
was known as the BSC Insurance and was a statutory scheme under which the
Building Services Corporation (the Corporation), constituted
under the former
Act, was the insurer.  There were two schemes of insurance: one known as the
BSC Comprehensive Insurance Scheme
and the other, the BSC Special Insurance
Scheme.  The BSC Comprehensive Insurance protection automatically applied to
residential
building work where the holder of an appropriate licence contracted
to do the work; where the cost exceeded $1000; where the work
was of a kind
that required building approval under the Local Government Act 1919 and where
the work was not performed under an owner-builder
permit.  Under s 94 it was an
offence if the prescribed premium for the BSC Comprehensive Insurance was not
paid within thirty days
after the holder of an appropriate licence contracted
to do residential building work to which the BSC Comprehensive protection
applied.
 Significantly, in the context of this litigation, s 97 of the former
Act provided that a contract was not invalidated because of
any failure to
comply with its insurance requirements.  
<P>

13   	The Building Services Corporation Regulation made under
the former Act prescribed the form of the BSC Comprehensive Scheme
in terms of
Form 4 as specified in cl 3 of the Regulation.  Form 4 provided for a statutory
scheme of insurance.  Under cl 2 of Form
4 the scheme was described as covering
"insured building work", which was defined by cl 1 as meaning "residential
building work,
... contracted to be done... by the holder of an appropriate
licence".  Under the former Act, residential building work was defined
to
mean:
<P>

"any work involved in, or involved in co-ordinating or supervising any work
involved in: (a) the construction of a dwelling; or
<P>

(b) the making of alterations or additions to a dwelling; or
<P>

(c) the repairing, renovation, decoration or protective treatment of a
dwelling."
<P>

"[D]welling" was defined to mean:
<P>

"a building or portion of a building that is designed, constructed or adapted
for use as a dwelling..."
<P>

14   	Under the statutory scheme, cl 4  of Form 4, of the
Regulation identified the beneficiaries as:
<P>

i) the owner of the land on which the residential building work was done;
<P>

ii) the person other than the owner who contracted to have the residential
building work done; and 
<P>

iii) the successor in title to the owner. 
<P>

It excluded the licence holder who carried out the residential building
work.
<P>

15   	Cl 5 of Form 4 was the indemnity provision and it provided
that the Corporation would indemnify the following losses:
<P>

i) the deposit paid under a contract to do the work;
<P>

ii) the difference between payment made under the contract and the reasonable
market cost of the work;
<P>

iii) the cost of completion;
<P>

iv) the cost of rectification of defects.
<P>

16   	Under the Act the statutory scheme of insurance has been
replaced by a scheme based upon a conventional contract of insurance.
 The form
of the contract of insurance required to satisfy s 92 is provided for in s 99
of the Act as follows:
<P>

<b>"99  Requirements for insurance for residential building work</b>
<P>

A contract of insurance in relation to residential building work required by
section 92 must insure:
<P>

(a)  a person on whose behalf the work is being done against the risk of
loss
<P>

resulting from non-completion of the work because of the insolvency or death of
the contractor or because of the fact that, after
due search and inquiry, the
contractor cannot be found, and 
<P>

(b)  a person on whose behalf the work is being done and the person's
<P>

successors in title against the risk of loss arising from a breach of a
statutory warranty in respect of the work."
<P>

17   	The statutory warranties referred to are those prescribed
by s 18B of the Act as warranties that the work will be performed
in a proper
and workmanlike manner and in accordance with the contract: that all materials
will be good and suitable for the required
purpose and, unless otherwise
stated, will be new: that the work will be done in accordance with the general
law:  that the work
will be done with due diligence: that the work will result
in a dwelling reasonably fit for occupation and that materials will be
reasonably fit for the specified purpose,  where that purpose is made known to
the holder of the licence.  
<P>

18   	Under cl 42 of the Regulation made pursuant to the Act,
the prescribed insurance contract "must provide that the beneficiaries
under
the contract are: 
<P>

(a) a person: 
<P>

(i) on whose behalf residential building work covered by the contract is done
or is to be done, or
<P>

(ii) ...
<P>

(iii) ...
<P>

(b) a successor in title to any person referred to in paragraph (a) (i), (ii)
or (iii)."
<P>

19   	Cl 43 of the Regulation provides that the insurance
contract must indemnify the beneficiaries from loss or damage resulting
from
non-completion and for breach of  the statutory warranties.  Par 3 of that
clause provides further that the contract must indemnify
the beneficiary for
the following:
<P>

"(a)  loss or damage resulting from faulty design, where the design was
provided by the
<P>

        contractor or supplier, or
<P>

(b)   loss or damage resulting from non-completion of the work because of early
termination of the contract for the work because
of the contractor's or
supplier's wrongful failure or refusal to complete the work or supply, or
<P>

(c)  the cost of alternative accommodation, removal and storage costs
reasonably and necessarily incurred as a result of an event
referred to in
subclause (1) or (2), or
<P>

(d)   loss of deposit or progress payment due to an event referred to in
subclause (1) or (2)."
<P>

20   	Par (4) of cl 43 provides as follows:
<P>

"(4)   The insurance contract must state that the risks indemnified include the
acts and omissions of all persons contracted by
the contractor, supplier,
owner-builder or other person to perform the work resulting in loss or damage
of a kind referred to in
this clause."
<P>

If the Act had applied to the head contract works, compliance with such a
provision would result in an insurance contract which
covered the "acts and
omissions" of ACS.  It seems anomalous in relation to that insurance contract
that ACS would also be required
to have in place a separate contract of
insurance under s 92.
<P>

21   	In my view, the answer to the separate questions is
provided by the provisions of s 91 and cl 39 of schedule 4 to the Act.

<P>

22   	Multiplex submits that the combined operation of s 91 of
the Act and cl 39 of schedule 4 to the Act has the dual effect of
Pt 6 of the
former Act applying to the head contract works, and Pt 6 of the Act applying to
those parts of that residential building
work where a sub-contract to perform
any of those parts was entered into on or after 1 May 1997.   The way in which
it was put on
behalf of Multiplex was as follows:
<P>

"15   ...:-
<P>

(a)   clause 39 is a savings provision.  It is not a transitional provision in
the sense that it
<P>

assists the new 1996 scheme of private insurance of new risks.
<P>

(b)<b>   clause 39</b> says that the "work" insured under the old automatic
statutory insurance scheme in relation to work covered by the old scheme before
1 May 1997, continues to be insured under the old scheme.  The risks covered by
the old scheme were all defined by reference to the
"work".  Clause 39 has
nothing to say about the new risks and the new private contract of insurance
required for the new risks defined
under the new 1996 legislation which are
referable to the specific contractor, in this case the plaintiff: see s.99 and
Part 2C particularly
s.18B (see para 5(b) above).  Clause 39 has nothing to say
about s.92 by which a person such as the plaintiff is prohibited from
contracting to do any residential building work unless a <b>contract </b> of
insurance that complies with the new Act is in force.  Under the old Act there
were no contracts of insurance.  
<P>

(c)  the consequence of the plaintiff's argument is that the new risks under
the 1996 legislation are uninsured."
<P>

In my view the distinction sought to be drawn between the subject matter of
"residential building work" and the subject matter of
a "contract to do any
residential building work" is without substance.
<P>

23   	The incidence of operation of both s 91 of the Act and cl
39 of schedule 4 to the Act is upon residential building work. 
The continued
application of Pt 6 of the former Act to residential building work is provided
for in cl 39 of schedule 4 to the Act
as follows:
<P>

<b>"39   Former insurance schemes</b>
<P>

(1)   <u>Part 6</u>, as <u>in force</u> immediately <u>before the commencement
of</u> Schedule 4[3] to the <u>amending Act</u>, and any other provisions of
this Act or the regulations relating to insurance under this Act as so in
force, <u>applies to work insured</u>, or existing work required to be insured,
<u>under that Part before that commencement</u>, in the same way that those
provisions applied immediately before that commencement." (emphasis added)
<P>

24   	The application of the amended Pt 6 to residential
building work in the Act is provided for in s 91 of the Act in the following
terms:
<P>

<b>"91   When Part applies</b>
<P>

(1)   This <u>Part, as amended</u> by the Building Services Corporation
Legislation Amendment Act 1996,  <u>applies to residential building work</u> or
owner-builder work <u>only to the extent that it is done or is to be done or
has been done under a contract made on or after the date of</u> <u>commencement
of this section</u> or, if it is done otherwise than under a contract, only to
the extent that it is commenced on or after that commencement." (emphasis
added)
<P>

25   	There is no dispute that Pt 6 of the former Act applied to
each of the 371 units comprised in the residential building work,
the subject
of the head contract, which was entered into 30 April 1997.  Under the former
Act, Pt 6 automatically put in place a
statutory scheme of insurance to cover
the whole of the works including the works the subject of the ACS sub-contract.
Under that
statutory scheme of insurance the principal under the head contract
with Multiplex was indemnified against loss, including the cost
of
rectification of ACS's work performed as part of the head contract work  (Cl 5
of the Regulation under the former Act).  The emphasised
portion of cl 39 of
schedule 4 to the Act is unambiguous in its expression of legislative intention
that the insurance provisions
of the former Act, including principally Pt 6,
applied to the performance of the 371 unit residential building works, the
subject
of the head contract.
<P>

26   	In my view, s 91 of the Act is equally clear in its
intention to exclude residential building works from the operation of
Pt 6 of
the Act where those works are the subject of a contract for their performance
made before 1 May 1997.  It is the complementary
provision to cl 39 of schedule
4 and "only" applies where the contract to perform the residential building
work was made on or after
1 May 1997.  The "residential building work" referred
to in each of those provisions does not change in the turning of pages in the
Act from s 91 to cl 39 of schedule 4.  It is comprised in the 371 units and
every part of that residential building work including
the sub-contract works.

<P>

27   	I think the wording of those two provisions is unambiguous
and offers no support for the distinction sought to be drawn on
behalf of
Multiplex. 
<P>

28   	In my view the answer to question 1.1 of the separate
questions should be answered in the negative and the question in 1.2
does not
call for an answer.  
<P>

29   	While it is unnecessary to consider other arguments
advanced by the parties in relation to the questions for separate
determination,
it may be of some benefit to offer my view on the operation of
Pt 6 of the Act.  
<P>

30   	It was submitted on behalf of ACS that s 92 of the Act did
not apply to sub-contractors and that Pt 6 of the Act does not
call for a
"multi-hyphened tiered insurance" structure to be put in place in relation to a
residential building work.  Support for
that contention was said to be found in
the provisions of s 98 of the Act which is in the following terms:
<P>

<b> "98   Employees and others not required to insure</b>
<P>

Nothing in this Part:
<P>

(a)   requires a person who carries out work for a person required by this Part
to obtain insurance in respect of that work to obtain
insurance, or
<P>

(b)   makes the first-mentioned person liable for an offence for failing to do
so."
<P>

31   	In the written submissions on behalf of Multiplex reliance
was placed upon the heading to the section as evidencing a legislative
intention to restrict the ambit of s 98 to employees "and others of that ilk,
such as consultants", relying upon the operation of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/s35.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 35(4)(b)</a> of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ia1987191/" class="autolink_findacts">Interpretation Act 1987</a>.  However, during the course of oral submissions that
proposition was abandoned, that is, to the extent that it relied upon the
terminology
of the heading to the section.  However, in my view, whether one
has regard to the heading or not, the section should not be construed
to have
the limited operation advanced on behalf of Multiplex.  It is wide enough to
embrace a sub-contractor for works in respect
of which the head contractor is
required to obtain insurance pursuant to Pt 6 of the Act.    However, I do not
think that it follows
that s 92 has no application to sub-contractors
generally.
<P>

32   	It was submitted on behalf of Multiplex that one should
contrast the phrase "work for" where used in s 98 with the phrases
"on behalf
of" or "on whose behalf" residential building work is done, where those phrases
are used in ss 4 and 99 of the Act, respectively.
 It is said that the term
"work for" is "suggestive of persons in a different relationship to licensed
contractors - such as employees
and the like".  I am unable to read that
distinction into the different terminology adopted in those sections and s 98.
The use of
phrases "work for" or "on behalf of", in my view, is merely an
alternative use of terminology to denote contractual relationships
in relation
to residential building work without seeking to draw any nicer distinctions
within those relationships.  
<P>

33   	Further, it was submitted on behalf of Multiplex that s 4
of the Act clearly applied to sub-contractors and, accordingly,
that s 92 had a
similar ambit.  S 4 is in the following terms:
<P>

<b>"4   Unlicensed contracting</b>
<P>

A person must not contract to do:
<P>

(a)   any residential building work, or
<P>

(b)   any specialist work,
<P>

except as or on behalf of an individual, partnership or corporation that is the
holder of a licence authorising its holder to contract
to do that work.
<P>

Maximum penalty:  100 penalty units."
<P>

34   	I think all that s 4 is saying is that residential
building work must be performed by the holder of a licence under the Act,
and
anybody contracting to do that work, must do so as, or on behalf of, such a
holder of a licence.  I accept that that provision
would extend to a
sub-contractor contracting to perform residential building work and that such a
sub-contractor must be a holder
of a licence under the Act.  In my view that
has nothing to say about the operation of s 92.  
<P>

35   	As it happens, I think s 92 is capable of extending to
sub-contractors, but not in the way submitted by Multiplex.  That section
prohibits a person from contracting to do any residential building work "unless
a contract of insurance that complies with [the]
Act <u>is in force in relation
to the proposed work</u>" (emphasis added).  S 92(1) does not say that the
contract of insurance is one that is required of the sub-contractor under a
head
contract where the head contractor is obliged to insure under s 92.  All
that is required is that there be a contract of insurance
in force in relation
to the work.  That requirement is satisfied by the head contractor's contract
of insurance.  That construction
has to be read in conjunction with s 92(2).  I
think the latter subsection is satisfied in the last mentioned situation where
the
head contractor's certificate of insurance is attached to the sub-contract.
That construction, in my view, is also consistent with
the obligation of a
sub-contractor, who is engaged in the performance of residential building work,
to hold a licence under the Act.
 
<P>

36   	That construction of s 92 is consistent with the operation
of s 98 as advanced in these  reasons and is also consistent with
the limited
operation of s 94 which is concerned with a "person who enters into a contract
in contravention of section 92 (1)...",
pointedly, I think, omitting any
reference to s 92 (2): pointedly, because the operation of s 92 (1) and (2)
which I have advanced
would lead to an anomaly if s 94 (1) precluded
enforceability of a sub-contract by a sub-contractor, where the head
contractor, under
an obligation not to contract without having in place a
contract of insurance in relation to the head contract works, had failed
to
attach the certificate of insurance to the sub-contract. 
<P>

37   	It will be seen that the construction of s 92 as presented
in these reasons is at odds with the form of the question in par
1.1 of the
separate questions.  If s 92 applied to ACS, it would not be "required to have
in force a contract of insurance in compliance
with Pt 6 of the ...Act".  The
section would prohibit ACS from contracting to do "residential building work
unless a contract of
insurance that complies with [the] Act [was] in force in
relation to the proposed work".  If under a head contract there is "a contract
of insurance...in force in relation to the proposed work" of a sub-contactor
there is no prohibition against the sub-contractor contracting
to do that
work.
<P>

38   	Expressed shortly, the s 92 requirement is to have in
place a contract of insurance which complies with the Act in relation
to the
proposed work.  It is silent as to the manner in which that insurance is put in
place.  Hence, the requirement in relation
to sub-contract works is satisfied
by there being in place the requisite contract of insurance in relation to the
head contract works.
 Although not germane to my construction of s 92, that
construction is underscored by cl 41 of the Regulation under the Act which
is
in the following terms:
<P>

<b>"41   Persons who may arrange insurance contracts</b>
<P>

An insurance contract may be entered into for the purposes of Part 6 of the Act
by a contractor or supplier, or by a beneficiary
in respect of the work done or
kit home supplied, and may be arranged by any such person."
<P>

39   	Multiplex relied upon the express exemption of
sub-contractors from the requirements of s 6 of the former Act, requiring
residential
building contracts to be in writing, as  indicative of the
intention in Pt 6 of the Act to include sub-contractors in the obligations
to
insure: pointing to the absence of any express exemption of sub-contractors.
This exemption was provided by cl 11 of the Regulation
under the former Act (as
amended under the Building Services Corporation Amendment Regulation 1997).  An
exemption in similar terms,
is provided for in cl 13 of the Regulation under
the Act.  That regulation commenced on 1 September 1997, after the parties had
entered
into the sub-contract.  In any event, I see no significance in the
absence of an express exemption of sub-contractors from compliance
with Pt 6 of
the Act.  On the construction of Pt 6 advanced in these reasons,
sub-contractors may well be embraced within the operation
of the insurance
provisions of the Act.  As I read s 92 the obligation is cast upon a party
contracting to perform residential building
work, whether as head contractor or
sub-contractor, to ensure that there is in place a contract of insurance, "in
force in relation
to the proposed work".
<P>

40   	It was submitted on behalf of ACS that Multiplex was a
developer within the meaning of s 3A of the Act.  The evidence does
not permit
such a finding.  In any event, the reliance by ACS on the operation of s 96,
requiring a contract of insurance to be in
place where residential building
work is undertaken by a developer, does not add to the construction of s 92 of
the Act advanced
on behalf of ACS.  
<P>

41   	It was also submitted on behalf of ACS that the
description of beneficiaries under the required contract of insurance is
indicative
of a legislative intention that the benefit of the insurance
provisions is for the consumer and has no application to a head contractor/
sub-contractor relationship.  There is some support for this in the second
reading speech for the Building Services Corporation Legislation
Amendment Bill
1996 (the bill).  
<P>

42   	The same observations may be made in relation to the
explanatory memorandum which accompanied the bill and which is silent
on the
relationship of head contractor and sub-contractor in the performance of
residential building work.  
<P>

43   	Similar support for the position of ACS is found in the
form of the contract of insurance required under the Act and which
requires an
indemnity in respect of loss arising from breach of statutory warranties some
of which are of a kind that one would not
normally associate with the
performance of work by a sub-contractor under a head contract for the
performance of residential building
work.  However, in my view, it does not
follow that the prohibition in s 92 does not apply to a sub-contractor.  Nor
does it mean
that the s 18B warranties are not implied in the sub-contract,
however inappropriate that implication may be in a particular case.
<P>

44   	It is my view that it is not necessary to construe Pt 6 of
the Act as having no application to a sub- contractor.  Clearly
Pt 6 of the Act
is designed to ensure that in the performance of residential building work
there is in place a contract of insurance
complying with the provisions of the
Act and while the primary responsibility for effecting that insurance will, in
nearly all such
cases, fall upon the shoulders of the head contractor,
nevertheless, it remains the obligation of a sub-contractor not to contract
to
do any residential building work under a head contract, without being satisfied
that a contract of insurance is in place.  
<P>

45   	In considering the separate question in par 1.2 of the
separate questions I think it has to be approached on the basis that
my
construction of the transitional and insurance provisions of the Act is
erroneous: that question 1.1 should be answered in the
affirmative: that Pt 6
of the former Act applies to the whole of the head contract works and that,
additionally, Pt 6 of the Act
applies to the sub-contract works.
<P>

46   	In my view, on the basis of the agreed facts, there is
really only one matter that calls for attention, namely, whether public
policy
considerations preclude ACS from relying on waiver or estoppel to preclude
Multiplex's reliance on the provisions of s 94
of the Act.  Otherwise, the
facts of the case readily satisfy the requirements of estoppel as identified by
Brennan J in <i>Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher </i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/7.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 7</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%20164%20CLR%20387" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 164 CLR 387</a>
at 428-429.  It has been submitted on behalf of Multiplex that there is no
element of unconscionability in its conduct in relying
upon ss 92 and 94 of the
Act  on the facts of this case.  I disagree and see no point in elaborating
upon that conclusion other than
to observe that:
<P>

1. The unconscionability involved in Multiplex's conduct in reliance upon s 94
of the Act is, in my view, embarrassingly obvious,
and
<P>

2. The fact that Multiplex did not turn its mind to the operation of Pt 6 of
the Act prior to the commencement of these proceedings
is, in my view,
irrelevant in the context of its unconscionable conduct.
<P>

47   	Whether the question is approached as raising an issue of
estoppel or waiver is immaterial, in that either path, if they are
separate
ones at all in this case, converge at the point of public interest.
<P>

48   	The question to be addressed, in my view, is whether the
provisions of Pt 6 of the Act, in particular ss 92 and 94, evince
an intention
to protect interests that may not be jeopardised by the agreement or the
conduct of those bound by the legislation.
 The public interest in Pt 6 of this
legislation is clear: the protection of an ultimate `consumer' of a residential
building, usually
its owner, from shoddy or non-performance of residential
building works by having in place statutory warranties and a contract of
insurance indemnifying the beneficiaries under the Act from loss, inter alia,
through non-performance or breach of those warranties.
 
<P>

49   	Even if ss 18B and 92 of the Act are construed to impose
statutory warranties upon ACS for the benefit of Multiplex and a
requirement
that there be in place a contract of insurance which complies with the Act
indemnifying Multiplex as a beneficiary under
the policy, I think such a scheme
is only a servant of the underlying objective of protecting the ultimate
consumer and one beyond
the power of either Multiplex or ACS to circumvent, at
least to the extent that the ultimate consumer's interests are involved.
Beyond
that, there is no public interest, in my view, in the protection of the
interests of Multiplex under such a scheme of insurance.
 
<P>

50   	Part of the difficulty in examining the availability of
estoppel to preclude reliance by Multiplex upon ss 92 and 94 of the
Act lies in
the absurdity that results from the application of s 92 as construed by
Multiplex to residential building works of the
magnitude of the head contract
works.  In modern construction practices it would result in a multiplicity of
contracts of insurance,
each indemnifying the head contractor from loss
resulting from defective sub-contract works.  I fail to see any public interest
in
providing such protection to major building contractors who themselves would
have in place a contract of insurance, in compliance
with the Act, for the
benefit of the ultimate consumer in respect of the whole and each part of the
works.
<P>

51   	If I am entitled to look at the effect of the successful
application of estoppel in the context of the facts of this case
then, in my
view, there is no disservice to the public interest, which is protected under
Pt 6 of the Act, in precluding Multiplex
from relying upon ss 92 and 94 of the
Act.
<P>

52   	However, the penal nature of the s 92 prohibition, the
provision against contracting out in s 103D and the severity of the
consequences of contravention of s 92 imposed under s 94 of the Act, I think
are clear enough legislative indications of the public's
vested interest in the
adherence to the provisions of s 92 and of the legislative intention that the
operation of s 92 is not to
be circumvented by agreement, conduct of the
parties or otherwise.  I think that line of reasoning accords with the
authorities,
see: <i>Kok Hoong v Leong Cheong Kweng Mines Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1964%5d%20AC%20993" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1964] AC 993</a>
at 1016 -1017; <i>Barilla v James </i>(1964) 81 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 457, a decision
of the Full Court, particularly at 461- 464 in the judgment of Walsh J; and cf
<i>Beckford Nominees Pty Ltd v Shell Co of America Ltd </i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2073%20ALR%20373" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 73 ALR 373</a>
at 378-9 and <i>Clark Equipment Australia Ltd v Covcat Pty Ltd </i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2071%20ALR%20367" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 71
ALR 367</a> at 371.
<P>

53   	Whether these conclusions are an end of the matter depends
upon the question which one addresses, namely, whether the estoppel
acts to
circumvent the operation of ss 92 and 94 of the Act, or whether the estoppel
acts to circumvent the protection of the public
interest which the sections are
designed to provide.  If the former then, clearly, in this case, ACS may not
avail itself of the
benefit of estoppel.  If the latter, I think just as
clearly, estoppel is available to it.  I prefer the latter approach in a legal
action of this kind.  It permits an analysis or distilling of the essential
interest at stake and permits recourse to the particular
facts of a case in
deciding whether, in that case, the estoppel will leave the subject public
interest untrammelled.
<P>

54                Accordingly: 
<P>

    The question in par 1.1 of the Pt 31 order is answered in the negative.
<P>

    The question the subject of par 1.2 of that order does not arise.  
<P>

    The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff's costs of the separate
determination of   
<P>

    those questions.
