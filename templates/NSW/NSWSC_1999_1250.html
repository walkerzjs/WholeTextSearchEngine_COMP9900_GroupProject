<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Interrogatories)</b>
<P>

1   	The plaintiff sues in respect to a telecast on "<i>Today
Tonight" </i>on 14 February 1995.  The only substantive defence is common law
qualified privilege and privilege pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/s22.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 22</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act
1974</a></i> with cognate defences pleaded in respect of publication interstate.
<P>

2   	The Reply alleges that the defendant was actuated by
express malice and provides detailed particulars pursuant to SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/index.html#p67" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 67</a> r 19.
These particulars indicate a case, which if proved, would put the plaintiff in
a strong position.
<P>

3   	A dispute has arisen in relation to interrogatories
administered by the plaintiff.  The defendant's position generally is that
it
must be borne in mind that an order will not be made pursuant to SCR <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/da197499/index.html#p24" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 24</a> r
5(2) unless it is necessary at the time the order is made that the relevant
interrogatories be administered.  I was referred by
Mr Blackburn to the
statements of approach in the light of modern litigation practice expressed in
the Supreme Court of the Australian
Capital Territory, in, for example,
<b><i>Ryan v Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty Limited </i></b>(1990) 101
FLR 396 per Miles CJ at 397;  <b><i>Packer v The Australian Broadcasting
Corporation &amp; Ors</i></b> (Master Hogan. unreported, 31 March 1993); and,
<b><i>Carnell v Spier</i></b> (Miles CJ, unreported, 3 June 1997).  I was also
reminded of the statement of principle by Myers J in <b><i>American Flange
&amp; Manufacturing Co Inc. v Rheem (Australia) Pty Limited (No. 2)</i></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281965%29%20NSWR%20193" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1965) NSWR 193.</a>
<P>

4   	Ms Abadee for the plaintiff relied upon the decisions of
Hunt J in <b><i>Palmer v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty Limited </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%20727" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5
NSWLR 727</a> (at 731-2);  <b><i>Brown v Australian Broadcasting
Corporation</i></b> (Hunt J, unreported, 5 February 1987);  <b><i>Wran v
Australian Broadcasting Commission </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281984%29%203%20NSWLR%20241" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1984) 3 NSWLR 241</a> at 250-1.
<P>

5   	An attempt by the parties was made to resolve the dispute.
A schedule was prepared in accordance with desirable practice; 
but it was
incomplete.  The action is listed for hearing on 14 February 2000.  I propose
therefore, taking into account the submissions
for each side, merely to express
my view as to the requirement in relation to each disputed interrogatory, my
finding being in accordance
with my acceptance of the relevant party's
submissions thereon.
<P>

6   	Interrogatories 11 and 12:  disallowed.
<P>

7   	Interrogatory 14:  disallowed.
<P>

8   	Interrogatory 20:  it is noted that this is to be
re-administered and it will be allowed.
<P>

9   	Interrogatory 21:  allowed.
<P>

10   	Interrogatory 24(a):  allowed.
<P>

11   	Interrogatory 24(b):  disallowed.
<P>

12   	Interrogatories 25 and 26:  allowed.
<P>

13   	Interrogatory 28(d):  it is noted that this interrogatory
is not pressed.
<P>

14   	Interrogatories 33, 34 and 35:  allowed.
<P>

15   	Interrogatory 37:  allowed.
<P>

16   	Interrogatories 39, 40 and 41:  allowed.
<P>

17   	Interrogatories 43 and 44:  allowed.
<P>

18   	Interrogatory 45:  disallowed.
<P>

19   	Interrogatories 46 and 47:  it is noted that these
interrogatories are not pressed.
<P>

20   	A factor that has persuaded me to find in favour of the
plaintiff in relation to the bulk of the contested interrogatories
is the
particularised case of malice in the Reply and what relevantly, arguably and
necessarily can follow from the documents appended
to the interrogatories,
particularly by way of seeking admissions.
<P>

21   	I note the uncontested remarks of Mr Blackburn in the
context of costs of this application heard before me so long ago (regrettably)
as 5 February 1999.  It appears that the plaintiff has accepted the defendant's
position in relation to the interrogatories from
number 48 onwards (to 53) and
they were a substantial number of interrogatories.  It seems appropriate,
taking into account those
that have been allowed, those that have been
disallowed, those that have not been pressed and the one that is to be
re-drafted, that
the order for costs in relation to the application be that
each party pay its own costs.
<P>

22   	Accordingly the formal orders are:
<P>

1.	The plaintiff is to re-administer interrogatory 20 by 4pm on 7 January
2000.
<P>

2.	The defendant is to answer the interrogatories in accordance with these
reasons by 4pm on 24 January 2000.
<P>

3.	Each party is to pay its own costs.
<P>
