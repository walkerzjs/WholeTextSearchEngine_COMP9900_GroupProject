<P>

<b>COMMON LAW DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>NEWMAN J</b>
<P>

<b><u>WEDNESDAY, 24 NOVEMBER 1999</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>21367/95  -  Brett John COLLINS by his tutor John William Collins  v  THE
NOMINAL DEFENDANT</u></b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  This is a claim brought by a minor Brett John
Collins against the Nominal Defendant. The Nominal Defendant in
turn seeks, if
found liable pursuant to s 31 of the <b>Motor Accidents</b> <b>Act</b> 1988 as
amended, to recover from the alleged owner of a motorised trike which was
involved in an accident, Mr Michael Lahodiuk.
<P>

2   	The proceedings before me related only to matters of
liability. Accordingly, having regard to the wording of s 31, as no pecuniary
order in terms of damages is now to be made, it is not in fact open for the
court to make any order relating directly to recovery
pursuant to s 31.
However, the parties have agreed that it is appropriate that the court make
certain findings of fact in relation
to the issue which arose between the
Nominal Defendant and the owner so that in future that finding of fact can
dictate the course
of action to be taken by the parties.
<P>

3   	As I have said, the plaintiff is a minor. He was born on 7
March 1986. He sues by his tutor, John William Collins.
<P>

4   	The uncontested facts in the matter are that on 26th
December 1994 a group of friends, many of whom were related, went on a
camping
expedition to a site past East Gresford in this State in an area commonly known
as The Barrington Tops. The persons who attended
this camping expedition were a
Mr Graham Coates, his companion Jo-Anne Collins, her son, Brett Collins, the
plaintiff in the matter,
Alan and Jenny Coates, Alan Coates being Mr Graham
Coates' brother, their son Benjamin and two other children Joshua and Nicola of
that union. Mr Graham Coates' daughters Emma and Abigail were also present. 
<P>

5   	Mr Michael Lahodiuk was present with his then girlfriend,
now wife, whose name was Jenny Brand at that stage - (she married
Mr Lahodiuk
two weeks ago) and several children of Jenny Brand, namely a girl Jade and two
boys Tom and Richard, Richard being nicknamed
Fess. He carried the surname then
of Stewart. As I have said, the party gathered at this site in the Barrington
Tops on 26th December
1994.
<P>

6   	The group had with them a number of vehicles. Putting aside
motor cars, there were two motor bikes, ie ordinary motor bikes
consisting of
two wheels, and two motorised trikes. One of these trikes was a 200cc capacity
trike manufactured by Honda. The undisputed
evidence in the matter is that the
200cc Honda trike was in fact owned by Mr Michael Lahodiuk. Mr Lahodiuk gave
evidence in the matter
acknowledging that he was the owner and that he
purchased the conveyance some years before hand. It was of a variety generally
described
as being an all-terrain vehicle. It is a vehicle to be used in
circumstances where it is necessary to gain access to areas which
are not
accessible by road. In other words, the type of vehicle which was used for off
road recreational pursuits and by people such
as graziers when rounding up
cattle and sheep on properties.
<P>

7   	Benjamin Coates, (born on 20 December 1981) is, as I have
said, the son of Alan Coates. Unfortunately the evidence discloses
that his
mother Jenny Coates is recently deceased. Thus, by 30 December 1994, Benjamin
Coates had attained the age, and indeed very
recently attained the age of
thirteen.
<P>

8   	The evidence discloses - and it was not disputed in any way
- that Mr Alan Coates at the time, and still does, and has for
a long time,
operated a motor cycle store in the Newcastle area. Not surprisingly the
evidence discloses that Benjamin Coates from
a relatively early age became
proficient in riding motor cycles. 
<P>

9   	Benjamin Coates in evidence given this morning said that he
commenced riding motor cycles of the type usually referred to as
"trail bikes"
at the age of ten. As of 30 December 1994 it seems his experience in riding
those bikes was principally confined to
bikes of 100cc capacity or 175cc
capacity. As I again understand his evidence, he had ridden a very large trail
bike of 500cc capacity
but not in open ground, but around enclosed premises
owned by his parents. 
<P>

10   	The evidence is that of 30 December 1994, whilst but
thirteen years of age, Benjamin Coates was an experienced and apparent
competent rider of trail motor bikes.
<P>

11   	As I have said, one of the vehicles which was taken on
this expedition was a Honda motorised trike owned by Mr Michael Lahodiuk.
<P>

12   	On 29 December 1994 Mr Lahodiuk deposes to - and his
evidence again, as is much of the evidence in the case, uncontested -
gave
permission to Benjamin Coates to ride the trike on that day. He made it
conditional that Benjamin Coates was only to ride the
trike if his parents gave
permission for him so to do. The permission granted was to ride around the camp
site. There is no suggestion
in Mr Lahodiuk's evidence, nor was it suggested to
him, that he had given permission to Benjamin Coates to ride the motorised
trike
on a road, whether public or private. 
<P>

13   	On the morning of 30 December 1994 people involved in the
camping expedition were preparing to start the day. As I would understand
the
evidence, a number of people were breakfasting, abluting, and doing a variety
of things during the early part of the morning.
"Fess" Stewart, otherwise known
as Richard, approached his mother Jenny Brand and asked her if he could use Mr
Lahodiuk's trike.
Ms Brand had given evidence that as far a she was concerned
she herself had permission at all times to ride the trike, a proposition
in no
way denied by Mr Lahodiuk. In any event, it was her evidence that she allowed
her son to ride the trike. He was then aged,
as I understand it, about nine
years of age. She told him that he was to take it a short distance up a nearby
public road and at
a designated spot was to turn and return to the camp site.
As I understand the evidence, the public road in question is known as
Boonabilla Road. This he did.
<P>

14   	It was Richard (Fess) Stewart's evidence that having
completed what was in fact a relatively short journey he was approached
by
Benjamin Coates and asked if he could ride the trike. He (aged nine years) not
surprisingly acceded to the request made by a thirteen
year old boy. I make no
criticism of either of them; it is a perfectly normal situation. In any event,
it was Richard Stewart's evidence
that he saw Benjamin Coates mount the rider's
seat and the plaintiff got on the bike behind him as a pillion passenger. He
saw them
head off down Boonabilla Road.
<P>

15   	Sometime elapsed after their departure. Richard Stewart
became concerned about the time they had been absent and made that
concern
apparent to persons in the camp. Mr Graham Coates then mounted the second trike
and drove down the road some one hundred
and so metres where he came across an
unfortunate scene, namely, the trike being off the road suspended by the
branches in a tree
and the two boys on the ground, the plaintiff being
unconscious and Benjamin Coates in a dazed, semi conscious and confused
condition.

<P>

16   	Arrangements were then put in train to obtain help. It is
not necessary to detail those arrangements for the purposes of the
issues which
emerge in this case, save to mention that after the boys were transported in a
motor vehicle away from the scene, they
came in contact with two ambulances and
also Sergeant Edwards of the Dungog Police, the matter having been duly
reported. There is
no need to go into the circumstances of the reporting.
<P>

17   	Sergeant Edwards gave evidence which indicated that in the
conversation he had with Benjamin Coates, Benjamin Coates conceded
that he had
been the rider of the motorised trike. There is some confusion as to other
statements which might be ascribed to Benjamin
Coates at the time. I rather
gather that Sergeant Edwards - and I make no criticism of him because of the
circumstances - gained
information from a number of sources which he
summarised, and indeed that constituted the largest part of his evidence as far
as
statements relating to the circumstances of the accident are concerned. 
<P>

18   	Benjamin Coates himself gave evidence this morning. He has
no recollection of the accident. Indeed, he has no recollection
of even riding
the trike before hand. In the light of the circumstances of the accident and
the injuries which he no doubt suffered,
I do not regard his absence of memory
to be in any way surprising. 
<P>

19   	In evidence are photographs of the subject area, including
a photograph of the area of Boonabilla Road where the motorised
trike left the
road. Mr Graham Coates' evidence was that the photographs which were taken
about a year after the events depicted
the road in very much the same condition
as it was at the time of the accident. It is obvious it was an unmade road in
the Barrington
Tops and one having a rough surface. 
<P>

20   	There was evidence from Mr Graham Coates, that at the time
he arrived at the accident scene Benjamin Coates said he was not
going too fast
he must have hit a bump. Let me say, looking at the photographs, I have no
difficulty at all in accepting a person
riding a motorised tricycle along a
road like that could well hit a bump and lose control. Benjamin Coates being an
experienced motor
bike rider at the time whose experience encompassed trail
bike riding in rough conditions - was, in my view, a rider who should have
been
aware of the risk of losing control if one hit a bump at either the wrong angle
or, in the circumstances, the wrong speed. I
will turn to that matter later in
these reasons.
<P>

21   	I turn then to the factual matters relating to the
proposed recovery should - and indeed as I so find - the plaintiff be entitled
to judgment against the Nominal Defendant, ie recovery sought to be made
pursuant to s 31.
<P>

22   	Mr Graham Coates in evidence suggested that on the morning
of 30 December 1994 he believed he overheard Benjamin Coates making
a request
of Jenny Brand that he could ride the tricycle and that she acceded to that
request. She does not agree with that evidence.
In fairness to Mr Graham Coates
he made it quite plain at the time which existed immediately before the
departure of Benjamin Coates
and Brett Collins he had only just arisen and was
not functioning at his optimum level. In the circumstances of the confusion
which
undoubtedly followed once the accident itself was revealed, I am not
surprised that Mr Graham Coates' memory as to exact matters
is not perfect.
<P>

23   	In the circumstances, looking at the evidence of Richard
(Fess) Stewart as to how the request was made to him by Benjamin
Coates, the
evidence of the now Jenny Lahodiuk, the evidence of Mr Michael Lahodiuk that he
was not in any way approached on the
day by anybody requesting the use of his
motorised tricycle, I am driven to the conclusion that the most probable
explanation of
any request was one made by Benjamin Coates to Richard Stewart,
a request made by a thirteen year old to a nine year old. In the
circumstances
I am of the view that in no way was Richard Stewart empowered by Mr Michael
Lahodiuk to give permission for the use
of the tricycle.
<P>

24   	An issue emerges that in the light of Mr Lahodiuk granting
permission the day before to Benjamin Coates to ride the tricycle,
was that
permission still extant on the day of the accident, 30 December 1994.
<P>

25   	Section 31 of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/maa1988166/" class="autolink_findacts">Motor Accidents Act</a></b> 1988 provides
a defence if the owner establishes to the satisfaction of the court that at the
time of the occurrence some other person
was driving the motor vehicle without
the owner's authority. The last clause in s 31(2)(a) is easily made out: Some
other person
was driving the motor vehicle, namely, Benjamin Coates. The
permission which was granted the day before was of a restricted type,
as I have
said, it was for use in the immediate area, conditional upon permission being
granted by Benjamin Coates' parents on the
day in question. At the time of the
accident I find that Benjamin Coates was in fact riding the motorised tricycle
without any authority
for him to do so being give by the owner Mr Michael
Lahodiuk. The permission given by Mr Lahodiuk was confined to the previous day.
In other words, if I am called upon to determine the matter I would uphold the
defence. But, as I have already pointed out, because
no pecuniary finding is to
be made there is no recovery which could be made by the Nominal Defendant at
this stage. That is a finding
of fact which I make.
<P>

26   	As far as negligence is concerned, it was submitted to me
that in the absence of any solid evidence as to speed and I have
adverted
already to the uncertainty surrounding a suggestion that Benjamin Coates said
that the tricycle was being ridden at 35 kilometres
per hour, there is no
evidence upon which I could confidently arrive at a conclusion that Benjamin
Coates was driving the tricycle
at an inappropriate speed which gave rise to
the circumstances which led to the accident. 
<P>

27   	The fact of the matter is that the tricycle was off the
road. It was a rough road. Benjamin Coates was at the time an experienced
rider, not necessarily of motorised tricycles but of motor bikes. There is no
evidence of any other traffic on the road at the time,
either passing by in one
direction or the other by the camp. Benjamin  Coates was regarded as saying, by
Mr Graham Coates, that he
was not speeding but he must have hit a bump. I
believe it is a proper inference to draw that the motorised tricycle was thrown
from
the road following the striking of a rough area of the road. There is no
suggestion that visibility was other than perfect.
<P>

28   	Accordingly, I am of the view that the evidence
establishes that Benjamin Coates was in breach of his duty of care to keep
a
proper lookout and, that being so, the plaintiff would succeed in negligence
were he the defendant.
<P>

29   	He is not the defendant because the Nominal Defendant is
the defendant. There is no doubt this accident happened on a public
road in New
South Wales, a point very properly conceded by Mr Andrews because on the
evidence of Sergeant Edwards it is a road which
carries a one hundred
kilometres per hour speed limit. In my view there is sufficient evidence to
establish that it is a public road
in the State of New South Wales.
<P>

30   	The evidence is the motor tricycle was unregistered. We
have an unregistered tricycle being ridden in a negligent fashion
on a public
road in New South Wales. Thus the plaintiff is entitled to succeed against the
defendant. Accordingly, there will be
a judgment for the plaintiff. There will
be a cost order in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant and a cost
order in favour
of the cross-defendant, Michael Lahodiuk including reserved
costs.
