<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	<b>HER HONOUR:</b>    This is an appeal brought pursuant to
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 69(1)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/" class="autolink_findacts">Local Courts (Civil Claims) Act</a></b> 1970 against the
determination of a Magistrate given on 20 April 1999.  Accordingly, the
provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lcca1970250/index.html#p5" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 5</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act</a></b> 1902 together with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/index.html#p51b" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 51B</a> of the
<b>Supreme Court Rules</b> apply. 
<P>

2   	The defendants (the plaintiffs in the proceedings before
the Local Court) sued the appellants, Atlas International Travel Pty
Ltd
("Atlas")  and Pacific and International Travel Company  Limited ("PITC") by
Statement of Liquidated Claim for the sum of $10,000.
 It was pleaded that the
plaintiffs had agreed to pay the defendants' legal costs in relation to the
sale of a business conducted
by the plaintiffs and that they had failed so to
do.  The proceedings were commenced in the Local Court at Tamworth but
subsequently
transferred to the Downing Centre.  
<P>

3   	The Magistrate gave judgment for the defendants in the
amount of $10,000.  
<P>

4   	The defendants sued upon an agreement made on 9 October
1997.  On the face of it the plaintiffs were not parties to that agreement.

<P>

5   	The plaintiffs appeal against the whole of the decision of
the court below.  It is contended that the Magistrate erred in law
in finding
the plaintiffs liable to the respondents in the sum of $10,000. In the
Statement filed pursuant to r (8) Pt 51B <b>SCR </b>the plaintiffs contend that
the Magistrate disregarded the doctrine of privity of contract and decided the
matter upon a consideration
of the intention of the parties.  This, it is
submitted, disclosed error.  
<P>

6   	The defendants tendered a number of documents before the
Magistrate.  No oral evidence was adduced.  The material before his
Worship
comprised agreements signed by the defendants dated 3 October 1997, 9 October
1997 and 10 December 1997, a statement of Warwick
Donald Bennet, certain ASIC
historical extracts, and two other documents not presently relevant.  
<P>

7   	The agreement sued upon was a handwritten agreement dated 9
October 1997.  It was stated to be a variation of an earlier agreement
dated 3
October 1997.  The latter was described as being a "preliminary agreement".
The preliminary agreement contemplated, upon
the happening of certain events,
that the parties would enter into a formal contract for the defendants to sell
their share and unit
holdings in Atlas and the Atlas International Travel Trust
("the Trust") to Siva Subramaniam or his nominee.  The defendants did
enter
into such an agreement on 10 December 1997.  The Magistrate had regard to the
contents of the three agreements read together
in arriving at his decision.  It
is not submitted that he erred in so doing.  
<P>

8   	Atlas and/or PITC operated the business of a travel agency.
Atlas was the trustee of the Trust.  In that capacity Atlas owned
all of the
assets and the whole of the issued capital of PITC.  In the period 3 October to
10 December 1997 the two directors of
Atlas were Warwick Donald Bennet (the
first defendant) and Allan Graham Smith (the second defendant).  Shirley
Margaret Smith, the
third defendant, and Warwick Bennet Pty Ltd (ACN 000 583
415), the fourth defendant, owned units in the Trust.
<P>

9   	The preliminary agreement entered into on 3 October 1997
recited that Siva Subramaniam ("the purchaser") had offered to purchase
the
shares and units held by the defendants in Atlas and the Trust and that the
defendants had agreed to accept his offer.  The purchase
price was expressed to
be $2,050,000 subject to the net tangible assets of the business being not less
than a named amount.  Provision
was made for two "due diligence periods" during
which the purchaser might make certain inquiries and raise requisitions in
respect
of the same.  It was agreed that the purchaser might nominate a
substitute purchaser to enter into the final contract.  Upon completion,
and
subject to the payment of the balance of the purchase price, the defendants
agreed to procure:  (a) the approval by the Board
of Directors of Atlas of the
transfer of the shares to the purchaser or his nominee;  (b) the appointment as
directors of Atlas and
PITC of the persons nominated for that purpose by the
purchaser;  (c) the resignation of all other directors of Atlas and PITC; and
(d) the registration of the purchaser (or his nominee) as holder of the units.

<P>

10   	The preliminary agreement further provided for the
purchaser to elect, by notice in writing, in lieu of the purchase of the
shares
and units in Atlas and the Trust, to call upon Atlas and/or PITC to sell to the
purchaser all of their assets.  In the event
of the purchaser so electing the
defendants agreed to procure Atlas and/or PITC to negotiate in good faith with
the purchaser in
relation to the sale and that it should be a term of any
resulting contract between the purchaser and Atlas and/or PITC that the
purchaser be entitled to select any of the employees of the business to join
the purchaser and the defendants must make (and procure
Atlas and PITC so to
do) such employees available to accept such offers.  
<P>

11   	By handwritten agreement dated 9 October 1997 the parties
agreed to vary the preliminary agreement in certain respects.  The
purchase
price of the business was fixed at $1,575,000 (AUD).  Provision was made for
the deferred payment of a portion of that sum.
 
<P>

12   	Cl 9 of the agreement of 9 October was in these terms:
<P>

"Siva shall be entitled to any profit from 1 July 1997.  Notwithstanding the
aforesaid the business shall continue to operate in
the normal manner and it is
expressly acknowledged that Siva's bonus and the legal fees of John Lyons
related to this transaction,
not exceeding $10,000 AUD, shall be payable by the
business."
<P>

13   	It was upon cl 9 of the agreement namely that the legal
fees of John Lyons, not exceeding $10,000, should be paid by the business
that
the present proceedings were brought. Mr Lyons, a solicitor with Lyons, Barnett
&amp; Kennedy, was retained by the defendants
in connection with the sale of
their interest in the plaintiff companies.  The reference to Mr Lyons' legal
fees being payable by
"the business" needs to be read in conjunction with the
definition contained in cl 1.1 of the preliminary agreement.  "The business"
is
there defined to mean the business conducted by Atlas and/or PITC.  
<P>

14   	The final agreement dated 10 December 1997 was between the
defendants and Breniva Pty Ltd (ACN 080 870 784), the nominee of
Mr
Subramaniam.  As at 10 December 1997 Mr Subramaniam was a director of Breniva.
That agreement in cl 2.2(d)(v) made provision both
that Mr Subramaniam's bonus
and the legal fees of John Lyons relating to the transaction, not exceeding
$10,000, should be payable
by the business.  The business was defined in that
agreement, again, to mean the business conducted by Atlas and/or PITC.  
<P>

15   	Settlement was effected on 10 December 1997.  On that
occasion the first defendant, Warren Bennet, was present together with
the
solicitor, John Lyons.  Mr Subramaniam and Andrew Chalmers, the other director
of Breniva, were also present with their solicitor,
Alan Brown.  Mr Bennet
heard John Lyons say to Alan Brown, "There's one little matter remains and
that's a cheque for myself".  Mr
Brown said he had not noticed the matter and
would go and make inquiries.  He left the room and returned a short time later
saying,
"I'm sorry it's been overlooked.  They don't have another bank cheque
with them.  I'll see you get it tomorrow".  It is common ground
that no such
cheque was forthcoming.  The defendants paid Mr Lyons' legal fees and brought
the proceedings in the Local Court against
the plaintiffs to recover the same.

<P>

16   	In the Local Court, and before me, the plaintiffs
contended that they could not be sued upon the agreement since they were
not
parties to it.  It appears that various other contentions were also advanced
before the Magistrate which are not relevant to
the hearing of this appeal.
His Worship's reasons for decision on the critical issue are contained in the
final paragraph of his
Judgment:
<P>

"Notwithstanding what is put on behalf of the defendants plural, especially in
relation to Privity of Contract the court would be
prepared to hold that the
parties entering into the Agreements, plural did so in their capacities as
Directors and specifically and
virtually solely in relation to the transfer
and/or sale of the business enterprise.  The Plaintiffs, in the view of the
court have
effectively bound their former companies with the charge for the
professional work to the stipulated ceiling or limit claimed."
<P>

17   	Mr Robinson who appeared for the defendants submitted that
no point of law was raised by the appeal.  He contended that the
Magistrate
had, by reference to the agreements, found that the directors were acting on
behalf of the company and that they had bound
the company.  This, Mr Robinson
submitted, was a finding of fact not open to challenge in these proceedings.
He referred me to <b>Azzopardi v Tasman UEB Industries Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%204%20NSWLR%20139" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 4 NSWLR
139.</a>  I do not consider that this submission is well founded.  Whether the
plaintiff companies are liable to be sued upon the agreement
between the
defendants and Mr Subramaniam made on 9 October 1997 seems to me to be a
question of law.  
<P>

18   	Mr Robinson further submitted that:
<P>

"Whilst the parties may have contracted in their personal capacities, it is
clear that they acted and intended to act on behalf
of the corporate entities.
The Directors representing the corporate mind of the companies intended (as did
the purchaser) to bind
the companies to the agreements.  As agents, they were
able to bind their principals.  Further, acting within authority, the companies
as principals were liable to their agents for the expenses relating to the
agreement."
<P>

19   	In support of his submission that the directors intended
to bind the companies by the agreements, Mr Robinson referred me
to a number of
clauses in the preliminary agreement of 3 October 1997 which are summarised in
paragraphs 9 and 10 above. He also
relied on cls 9 and 10 of the agreement of 9
October 1997 and cl 4.1(a) and (f) of the agreement of 10 December 1997 (the
agreement
between the defendants and Breniva) which he submitted further
evidenced a clear expression of intention that the plaintiff companies
were to
be bound by the agreements and that the defendants were acting "on behalf of
and for the benefit of the same". 
<P>

20   	The preliminary agreement, as varied by the parties'
agreement of 9 October 1997, was an agreement whereby the defendants
agreed to
sell and the purchaser agreed to purchase shares and units in Atlas and the
Trust (subject to the purchaser's right to
elect to require Atlas and PITC to
sell or assign their assets to him or his nominee pursuant to cl 9.1 of the
preliminary agreement).
It is clear that the defendants by virtue of their
share and unit holdings were in a position to control both  Atlas and PITC.
They
bound themselves to exercise that control over the plaintiff companies in
accordance with their agreement with the purchaser. It
is in this light that
the provisions of the three agreements to which Mr Robinson refers need to be
read. 
<P>

21   	It does not seem to me that a reading of the agreements
demonstrates that Atlas and PITC were to be made parties to them.
The companies
were not contracting with the purchaser. Shares and unit holdings in the
plaintiff companies were being sold.  I accept
the submission made by Mr
Sirtes, who appeared for the plaintiffs, that it would not have been possible
for the purchaser to obtain
specific performance as against Atlas and /or PITC
for breach of cl 9.1 of the preliminary agreement since neither company was a
party to the contract.
<P>

22   	As noted in paragraph 18 above, Mr Robinson submitted that
the defendant directors were acting as agents for the plaintiffs.
As such, he
contended, they had bound the plaintiffs. He referred to <b>Muirhead v
Commonwealth Bank of Australia</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20125%20FLR%20434" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 125 FLR 434</a> at 438-439 as authority
for the proposition that the agent's signature on a contract, whether in the
name of the principal or agent,
may operate as that of the principal.  This
submission seems to me not to address the issues raised by the subject
agreement. The
defendant directors were parties to the agreement (as varied) in
their personal capacity. They were agreeing to dispose of their
personal
property namely their shareholding in the first plaintiff. The agreement was
between the defendants as the owners of shares
and units in the plaintiff
companies and the purchaser.    
<P>

23   	I should note that Mr Robinson also referred to the
principle that an agent who incurs liabilities, or makes payments, on
behalf of
the principal may be indemnified against such liabilities or entitled to
recover monies paid out. He went on to submit
that the agreement of 9 October
1997 did no more than secure by way of agreement or charge a guarantee that the
directors' liabilities
incurred as agents of the company in relation to the
sale of the company's business to a maximum of $10,000 would be met by the
plaintiffs.
I am not persuaded by this analysis. The directors in this instance
did not incur liability as agents on behalf of the company. The
liability
incurred was the legal costs associated with the sale of defendants' share and
unit holdings in the company and the Trust.

<P>

24   	I do not consider that the acknowledgment in cl 9 of the
agreement of 9 October 1997 that the costs "shall be payable by the
business"
is enforceable by the defendants against the plaintiff companies. It follows
that I consider the Magistrate erred in law
in his determination set out in
paragraph 16 above.
<P>

25   	I order that the decision of the Magistrate herein given
on 20 April 1999 be set aside.
<P>

26   	I order that the Statement of Claim filed by the
defendants (as plaintiffs in the court below) being Local Court proceedings
No
12954 of 1998 be dismissed.
