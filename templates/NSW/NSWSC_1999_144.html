<b>70210/98  -  REGINA  v  GILBERT ADAM (aka DAWOOD ODISHOU) </b>
<P>

<center><b>SENTENCE</b></center>
<P>


<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  The prisoners Gilbert and Richard Adam were each placed on trial
on 10 October 1998 for the murder of Constable David
Carty.  Richard Adam was
charged in the alternative with inflicting grievous bodily harm to David Carty
with intent to do him grievous
bodily harm (Crimes Act 1900 s 33).  By their
verdicts, returned on 24 December 1998, Gilbert Adam was found by the jury to
have
been guilty of murder, while Richard Adam was found guilty of maliciously
inflicting grievous bodily harm (Crimes Act 1900 s 35).
 This offence was left
as an alternative to the count of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent
to do grievous bodily harm.
 It carries a maximum penalty of penal servitude
for seven years, while the maximum penalty for murder is penal servitude for
life.
<P>

2	The offences, of which the prisoners were convicted, occurred in the early
hours of the morning of 18 April 1997 in the carpark
to the Cambridge Tavern at
Fairfield.  Several other persons are yet to appear for trial in relation to
the physical injuries sustained
by David Carty in the carpark that led to his
death.  I will, accordingly, confine myself, in these reasons for sentence, to
the
evidence now before me, so far as it impacted upon the prisoners standing
for sentence and refrain from any factual findings concerning
the role of those
accused whose trial will commence later this year.  The prisoners are to be
sentenced upon the basis of the factual
findings that I am now to make, subject
to the requirement that those findings are consistent with the verdicts of the
jury: <b>Isaacs</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2041%20NSWLR%20374" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 41 NSWLR 374</a> at 378.
<P>

3	Upon the basis of the evidence led in this trial it may, however, be accepted
that the remaining accused, who were somewhat younger
than the prisoners, were
friends and members of a loose group of locals, largely, if not exclusively, of
Assyrian origin.  The prisoners
are of similar national background and each
emigrated to this country by reason of unrest in Iraq.
<P>

4	Common with many of their Iraqi compatriots, particularly those of an
Assyrian background who have settled in this country, they
have suffered
religious and personal discrimination and oppression of an extreme kind
sanctioned under the repressive and brutal
regime of Saddam Hussein.
<P>

5	Their own experience included forced and unwanted military service in wars
not of their making or choice, discrimination in education
and employment,
punishment for the perceived sins of an elder brother who deserted from the
army, arduous and dangerous escape over
the borders of Iraq and detention in
refugee camps.
<P>

6	The prisoners were not members of the street gang referred to from time to
time in these proceedings as the "Assyrian Kings".
 The group given that name
is suspected by police to be involved in drug distribution, car stealing, and
acts of violence directed
towards other ethnic gangs, and also towards police.
Whether an organised gang of that kind does in fact exist, and whether any of
the remaining accused, or indeed any of the individual witnesses called in this
trial do belong to it, is not a matter that requires
determination.  Nor is it
capable of determination by me, at this stage.  It suffices to say that some
police witnesses were of the
view that it does exist, while those civilian
witnesses who were accused by the defence of active involvement in the gang and
of
participation in criminal conduct, denied those allegations.
<P>

7	The existence of such a gang and their possible tendency or propensity
towards violence, and particularly to engage in aggressive
conduct directed
against the police, was no part of the prosecution case.  It became relevant
only so far as it was introduced, as
part of the defence case, that the attack
on Constable Carty was initiated by persons who were members of the "Assyrian
Kings", and
that certain prosecution witnesses who gave evidence incriminatory
of the prisoners, did so in order to shift the blame from gang
members to
them.
<P>

8	It was for that reason that evidence was received in relation to various
incidents during the evening of 17 April when certain
young men of Assyrian
origin, including Eddie Esho, were chipped by police in Spencer Street,
Fairfield, on separate occasions for
loitering, for offensive language and for
drinking in public and leaving beer bottles on the pavement.
<P>

9	Neither of the prisoners was among those young men who were spoken to by
police on those occasions, and there is no factual basis
for inferring that
they held any particular animus towards police before going to the Cambridge
Tavern at about midnight.  Nor is
there any basis for inferring that the
prisoners had travelled in company with the remaining accused to the hotel that
night, or
were in any way part of a premeditated plan (if there were one, which
I am not prepared at this stage to find) to extract revenge
against Constable
Carty because he had been involved in speaking to some of the young persons in
Spencer Street in firm tones over
their behaviour earlier that evening, or,
indeed, for any other reason.
<P>

10	In the light of that background, and upon the basis that the involvement of
the two prisoners in the fight that led to David
Carty's wounding and death was
impulsive and not premeditated, I return to the events that led up to it.
<P>

11	The evidence shows that from about midnight a number of police, including
Constable Auld and Constable Carty, gathered at the
Tavern for a drink after
coming off their shift.  They remained largely in the public bar area of the
Tavern.  At about the same
time a group of young Assyrians, including some of
the remaining accused, arrived at the Tavern.  A little later a separate group
of older Assyrians, including the two prisoners, arrived at the hotel.  
<P>

12	Most of the members of the two groups had earlier been drinking at the
Crescent Hotel, Fairfield ("Smarties"), the bar of which
had been closed when
some unidentified men, probably of Assyrian extraction, were seen to be
throwing glasses and bottles and generally
behaving in an unacceptable manner.
Whether they included the prisoners, I am unable to say.
<P>

13	The first group of Assyrians to arrive at the Cambridge Tavern included some
of the witnesses called by the Crown.  Others seem
to have been attracted to
the Tavern from the streets of Fairfield or from their homes.  In the result,
between midnight and 2.30am,
a large number of Assyrians were gathered at the
hotel.  Some were inside in the area known as the Casino or poker machine room,
and others were in the Manilla Bar or karaoke room, where a karaoke competition
and dancing were under way.  Others mingled in the
carpark and from time to
time walked into the hotel or looked into that room through the windows facing
onto the carpark.
<P>

14	Some patrons became alarmed by the conduct of these persons, regarding it as
threatening.  This concern was shared by some of
the police and also by the
barman, Mr Ritzman, who took steps to close off access to the public bar from
the outside.
<P>

15	By about 2.15am only three police remained at the hotel, Constables Carty,
Charlton and Auld.  They left the bar together.  Constable
Charlton spoke to
Constable Auld for a short time and then drove out of the carpark.  Constable
Auld drove her car over to a position
alongside the utility of Constable Carty.
He had started his vehicle and was waiting for the engine to warm up.  They had
a short
conversation, in the course of which he gave her a video.
<P>

16	The events thereafter are subject to significant differences, in detail, in
the accounts given by the various witnesses who were
in the carpark (Constable
Auld, Thaier Sako, Bashir Hurmiz, Dennis Oshana and Tony and Ronny Bakos), and
by the more remote witnesses
who saw portion of the fight either from inside
the hotel or as they made their way from the hotel to the fight or back from it
(Messrs
Ritzman, Davies and Batterham and Marilou Capuyan).
<P>

17	There is, however, a common thread, and taking into account possible errors
in identification, the differences are reconcilable
and no doubt provided the
basis upon which the jury reached their verdict.
<P>

18	I find Michelle Auld's account of the beginning of the fight to be credible
and to be largely consistent with the out-of-court
accounts given to police by
Thaier Sako and Bashir Hurmiz, and with the evidence of Tony Bakos given at the
trial.  Upon the basis
of their accounts I find beyond reasonable doubt that
Constable Carty was approached by several young men, including Thaier Sako
and
Gilbert Adam, as he stood alongside his car.  In the course of the ensuing
confrontation he was pushed by Thaier Sako and he
in turn pushed that man
away.
<P>

19	The men surrounded David Carty in a loose semi-circular formation.  Michelle
Auld realised from their actions, and from the tone
of their voices, that David
Carty was in deep trouble.  She moved quickly backwards towards the hotel to
call for help.  As she did
this, she noticed one of the men in this group
strike David Carty.  She saw a look of horror on his face and blood spurt from
his
chest.  She was unable to recognise this man later from the video which was
prepared, comprising photographs taken of men known to
have been at the Tavern
and from police records.
<P>

20	Although Constable Auld did not see Thaier Sako being injured, it is evident
from the accounts given by the other witnesses who
were closer to the scene
(including Bashir Hurmiz), and by those witnesses who were standing closer to
the Casino door (Tony Bakos
and Dennis Oshana), that he was accidentally
stabbed in the neck before Constable Carty was stabbed.
<P>

21	By whom Thaier Sako was stabbed is unclear.  It may be said, however, with
absolute conviction, that it was not by Constable
Carty.  There is no evidence
to suggest that he was armed with any weapon or that he did anything to incite
any confrontation.  The
evidence is to the contrary.  One witness (Tony Bakos)
in fact recalled him saying, when he was initially confronted, that he did
not
want any trouble.
<P>

22	Thaier Sako retreated towards the hotel, throwing down a machete with which
he was armed.  He collapsed on the ground outside
the Casino door, bleeding
heavily from his neck wound.  A number of his friends or associates gathered
and one hotel patron went
to his aid.  In the meantime, Thamir Sako, the elder
brother of Thaier Sako, and Richard Adam, the younger brother of Gilbert Adam,
who were each still inside the hotel, were alerted to the fight by some of the
Assyrians present, including Dennis Oshana.
<P>

23	By the time they arrived outside the word was about, wrongly, that David
Carty had stabbed Thaier Sako, and that the latter was
in imminent danger of
death.  Whether this suggestion was raised by the man who accidentally stabbed
him, or by one of his associates,
is incapable of determination at this stage.
It is evident, however, that it became a matter of common belief and incited
those who
had gathered at the Casino doorway, to join in the attack upon David
Carty, who was by this time lying on the ground mortally wounded.
<P>

24	Within moments the group of men around him increased, and several persons
were seen repeatedly to kick, stomp and punch at him.
 This was observed by
Michelle Auld, who had returned from raising the alarm.  She did her best to
beat off the assault, suffering
significant head and facial wounds in the
process.  It was also observed by Messrs Ritzman, Davies, Batterham and Marilou
Capuyan,
whose attention had been drawn to the fight.
<P>

25	The alarm having been raised by Michelle Auld and by Mr Ritzman at 2.20am,
it was answered by police and ambulance officers who
began to arrive at the
scene from about 2.30am.  David Carty was observed by the first police to
arrive to be barely alive.  Within
moments of the ambulance officers beginning
treatment, the flickering signs of cardiac activity that had been initially
apparent
on their monitor, ceased.  David Carty was transported to Liverpool
District Hospital but it was not possible to save him.
<P>

26	His death was due to a deep stab wound through the sternum, penetrating both
the front and back of the aorta.  He suffered multiple
slash wounds to the head
and back, severing part of his nose and his left ear, as well as multiple
abrasions and bruising consistent
with him being struck repeatedly by a
hard-surfaced object such as a boot, to his head and arms.  The wounds
inflicted were both
in their nature and their number brutal and horrendous.
They testify to the terrible savagery of the assaults inflicted upon him.
Nothing would be achieved by otherwise particularising what is recorded in the
post-mortem report and photographs.
<P>

27	The medical evidence shows that the death of David Carty was likely to have
occurred within ten minutes or so of the heart wound,
and the chances of him
being saved by medical treatment were, for all practical purposes,
non-existent.  The other wounds may have
accelerated the process to a degree,
but if so, it is difficult to imagine that they could have done so by other
than a trivial amount.
<P>

28	The conviction of Gilbert Adam of murder was based upon his involvement in
the initial stages of the fight as the person who
inflicted the fatal stab
wound, or alternatively, as a person engaged in a joint criminal enterprise
with the person who did inflict
that stab wound.  
<P>

29	His involvement as the person who inflicted the wound rested principally
upon the evidence of his cousin (Mrs Salwa), who said
that he returned to her
home at about 4am that morning wearing different clothes from those that he had
worn earlier that night;
that over the ensuing week he burnt the shirt and
trousers he had been wearing before he went to the hotel and cleaned the
interior
of his car, in each case, he told her, because of his fear that blood
may be found; that he had a cut on his hand; that he admitted
striking David
Carty with a knife, and later throwing it away; and that he made threats to her
to leave Sydney over the eight weeks
following the killing, particularly when
it became apparent that there was police interest in him and his brother.
<P>

30	Her evidence was supported to some extent by the evidence of Tony Bakos and
Dennis Oshana, so far as they said that they saw
Gilbert Adam leaving the hotel
soon after the incident, walking towards the area in which he acknowledged, in
his ERISP, that his
car had been parked, and returning some forty minutes or so
later wearing different clothes.  Oshana added that he saw blood on his
shirt
when he had been walking towards the car.  Mrs Salwa's evidence that Gilbert
Adam did have in his possession a knife before
and after the incident also
received some support from Tony Bakos and Ronny Bakos when they said that at
the time the Manilla Bar
was being closed he had jumped over the bar and
dropped a knife on the ground as he did so.  The fact that he did jump that bar
was
confirmed by the two persons who managed the Manilla Bar.
<P>

31	Although professing at the time to have seen very little of the incident,
the cross-examination of Bashir Hurmiz established
that he had seen a third
man, whom he did not know, involved in the initial incident.  It was his
evidence that he had not known
Gilbert Adam at the time of the killing.  His
evidence to this limited extent was consistent with the prosecution case.  
<P>

32	Moreover, although Thaier Sako similarly professed, at the trial, to have
seen virtually nothing of the incident which led to
the death of David Carty,
the prior representations that he made in his ERISP, which were proved
following leave given under s 38
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea80/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act</a>, pointed firmly towards
Gilbert Adam being centrally involved in the initial fight, and to have struck
David Carty while holding
something in his hand.
<P>

33	His central involvement in the fight was also suggested to the evidence of
Tony Bakos, as to the observations from the casino
doorway area.
<P>

34	Although in cross-examination and in re-examination he retreated somewhat
from his evidence in chief, it is likely that the jury
took the view that what
he had said in chief was true, and that his later answers were affected by the
length of time he had been
in the witness box.  
<P>

35	Further corroboration was provided for the Crown case through the
circumstances in which Gilbert Adam left the scene, and the
lie he told in his
ERISP as to his presence at the Cambridge Tavern at the time of the
incident.
<P>

36	I do not consider it possible upon the evidence to reach a conclusion beyond
reasonable doubt that it was Gilbert Adam who inflicted
the fatal stab wound as
distinct from being present aiding and abetting the person who did that act.
Any reasonable doubt in that
regard needs to be resolved in favour of the
prisoner: <b>O'Neill</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%202%20NSWLR%20582" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 2 NSWLR 582</a> at 588.  If it were possible to
come to a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that it was Gilbert Adam who
stabbed David Carty, that
would be a very significant factor towards a
conclusion that this was a case attracting an application of s 431B of the
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a>.  To that section I will return a little later.
<P>

37	In my view the culpability of each of those involved in the joint
enterprise, which I am satisfied did exist in the early stages
of the incident,
is extremely high.  That is the case whether he was the person directly
responsible for the fatal blow or a person
who had encouraged it.  In that
regard I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each person involved in the
enterprise, at that
early stage, shared an intention to kill David Carty.  The
violent nature of their actions and the advice which Gilbert Adam passed
on to
Thaier Sako after the event speak of such an intention.  David Carty was not an
aggressor.  He was peacefully making his way
home after completing his shift
and joining in a social drink with other police.  He was confronted by a group
of men, one of whom
was armed with a machete, and at least one other of whom,
Gilbert Adam, was armed with a knife.  There was evidence to the effect
that
Bashir Hurmiz was also carrying a knife.  Others may have been similarly
armed.
<P>

38	Constable Carty was known to be a police officer by some of these men,
including, I find, Gilbert Adam.  He had been part of
a group at the hotel who
were obviously police.  He was wearing part of his police uniform.  He was
confronted with a question as
to why he had pulled up Eddie Esho earlier.
Further, Tony Bakos gave evidence to the effect that Gilbert Adam walked over
to the
location where Thaier Sako was lying on the ground and said to his
brother, "The copper's dead".
<P>

39	The criminal culpability of Gilbert Adam is, accordingly, substantial.  The
crime of murder is the most serious in the calendar
and the sentence imposed
must reflect the twin elements of individual punishment and general deterrence.
The maximum sentence prescribed
by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s19a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 19A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a> for the offence is
intended for cases falling within the worst category of case for which that
penalty is prescribed: <b>Ibbs v The Queen</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/46.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 46</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20163%20CLR%20447" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 163 CLR 447</a> at 451-4522;
and <b>Holder and Johnstone</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%203%20NSWLR%20245" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 3 NSWLR 245.</a>
<P>

40	In deciding whether a particular case does fall within that category, it is
not necessary or even appropriate that there be a
search for, or consideration
of, whether there have been or might be worst cases: <b>Veen (No 2)</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/14.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1988] HCA 14</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20164%20CLR%20465" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986)
164 CLR 465</a> at 478.  Even if a case of murder answers the description of a
worse case, it does not automatically follow that a life sentence,
which means
in this case imprisonment for the remainder of the prisoner's life without any
hope of release, should be imposed.  
<P>

41	It has been recognised that except in circumstances of very great
heinousness, where it can be postulated that there are no facts
mitigating the
seriousness of the crime, the interests of society are not necessarily well
served by locking up an offender and throwing
away the key: <b>Kalajzich</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2094%20A%20Crim%20R%2041" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 94 A Crim R 41</a>; <b>Fernando</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2095%20A%20Crim%20R%20533" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 95 A Crim R 533</a>; and <b>Twala</b>
(Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales, 4 November 1994, unreported).
Particularly is that the case for a young man for whom
a life sentence, without
hope of release, may well be an utterly crushing outcome and one that provides
no incentive for rehabilitation
or cooperation within the prison system.
<P>

42	In <b>Garforth</b> (Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales, 23 May 1994,
unreported) the court identified some of the matters which can be taken
into
account in determining whether the circumstances of any particular offence of
murder, and of an offender, are such as to qualify
the case as falling within
the worst category of offence so as to attract the maximum penalty.  They
include any aggravating circumstances
of the killing; the presence of
callousness and lack of remorse; the possibility that the sentence may need to
be served on protection;
the extent to which the offender presents as a
continuing danger to society; and the prospects of rehabilitation and the
absence
of a plea of guilty.
<P>

43	In some of the cases decided concerning <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s19a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 19A</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act</a>, attempts
have been made to categorise, according to their nature, those killings which
might properly attract a life sentence, for
example, those involving a
professional or psychotic killer; those involving the kidnap or torture of
children; those involving a
repeat offender who has served a previous sentence
for murder; or those involving a thrill killing.  Obviously cases of this kind
call for consideration of the maximum penalty.  I do not, however, see any
particular advantage in attempting to reach a categorisation
of cases.  It is
preferable for the facts of any specific case to be weighed up, in the manner
identified in <b>Ibbs</b> and <b>Veen</b>, and for the principle of
proportionality to the crime to be respected.
<P>

44	In the present instance, I am of the view that the culpability of the
prisoner, Gilbert Adam, is aggravated first by the circumstance
that the target
of the attack was a police officer.  Although, so far as he is concerned, the
attack was not premeditated as a payback
for the earlier incidents, I am
satisfied that the identity of David Carty as a police officer was a
significant factor in the level
of violence offered, at the initial stage of
the confrontation.  The courts have made it clear, more than once, that police
who are
threatened with or subjected to violence in the course of their duties,
are entitled to the full protection of the law, and that
offenders who are
involved in crimes of this kind must expect condign sentences: <b>Crump</b>
(Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales, 7 February 1995, unreported);
<b>Myers</b> (Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales, 13 February 1990,
unreported); <b>Nasif</b> (Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales, 10 March
1995, unreported); <b>Rees</b> (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales, 22
September 1995, unreported; and <b>Hamilton</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2066%20A%20Crim%20R%20575" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 66 A Crim R 575</a> at
581.
<P>

45	The need for a substantial element of general deterrence, when sentencing in
cases of this kind, is compellingly obvious.  Police
officers are entitled to
expect the support of the courts in maintaining their authority and respect in
their office.
<P>

46	Although the cases cited were concerned with police who were wounded or
killed in the course of executing their duty, similar
consideration should
apply, in my judgment, to those who inflict violence upon off-duty police, that
is, so long as their selection
as a victim, or the level of violence applied,
can properly be said to be related to their office and is not purely
coincidental.
 The present case falls into that category.
<P>

47	The second circumstance of aggravation is the fact that Gilbert Adam carried
a knife, and that whoever killed David Carty on
this night used such a weapon,
in the course of what was an unprovoked assault in a public place.  The
Australian community regards
the carrying and the use of knives with the utmost
abhorrence.  Those who carry offensive weapons and those who employ them in
street
fights, can expect little by way of mercy when they appear for sentence:
<b>Rothapfel</b> (Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales, 4 August 1992,
unreported); <b>Watt</b> (Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales, 2 April
1997, unreported); and <b>Bell</b> (Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales,
29 September 1997, unreported).
<P>

48	The third related circumstance of aggravation is that this fight involved a
group of men, the precise identity of which cannot
be determined at this time,
who, on any view, outnumbered and overpowered the man whom they beset.  This
was a cowardly and brutal
group attack on an unarmed man who offered no
provocation or reason for this confrontation.  Again it needs to be stated this
community
abhors violence inflicted by groups in public places upon innocent
citizens and those who resort to this form of violence can similarly
expect
little mercy when they appear for sentence: <b>Henderson</b> (Court of Criminal
Appeal, New South Wales, 5 November 1997, unreported).
<P>

49	Moreover, as Street CJ said in <b>Rushby</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281977%29%201%20NSWLR%20594" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1977) 1 NSWLR 594</a> at 597:
<P>

	"...one of the main purposes of punishment, ... is to protect the public from
the commission of such crimes by making it clear
to the offender and to other
persons with similar impulses that, if they yield to them, they will meet with
severe punishment.  In
all civilised countries, in all ages, that has been the
main purpose of punishment, and it still continues so.  The fact that
punishment
does not entirely prevent all similar crimes should not obscure the
cogent fact that the fear of severe punishment does, and will,
prevent the
commission of many that would have been committed if it thought that the
offender could escape without punishment, or
with only a light punishment.  If
a court is weakly merciful, and does not impose a sentence commensurate with
the seriousness of
the crime, it fails in its duty to see that the sentences
are such as to operate as a powerful factor to prevent the commission of
such
offences.  On the other hand, justice and humanity both require that the
previous character and conduct of the individual offender,
and the effect of
the sentence on these, should also be given the most careful consideration,
although this factor is necessarily
subsidiary to the main considerations that
determine that appropriate amount of punishment".
<P>

50	This passage has particular significance, in a case such as the present,
where powerful considerations exist in favour of a strongly
deterrent sentence.

<P>

51	I have given urgent consideration to the question whether this is a case
where s 431B(1) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act 1900</a> applies so as to attract a mandatory
sentence of penal servitude for life.  That sentence is required as a matter of
law where the
court is satisfied that the level of culpability of the prisoner
is so extreme that the community interest of retribution, punishment,
community
protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of such a
sentence. 
<P>

52	Although the culpability of Gilbert Adam is extremely high, I am not
satisfied that it is so extreme as to attract that sentence.
 Rather, the case
is one that calls for a determinate sentence, although one of considerable
length.  In coming to that conclusion,
I state that I am not persuaded by the
Crown submission that the offence has been aggravated, on this occasion, by the
circumstances
that it did not occur in the course of resisting arrest.  It
would be, in my view, curious if credence was to be given to a proposition
that, in some way, resistance to execution by police of their lawful duties was
either understandable, or excusable, or of lesser
culpability than random
violence directed towards them.
<P>

53	I turn to the subjective circumstances as they apply to Gilbert Adam.  He is
now aged thirty-three years.  He is an Iraqi citizen
who came to this country
in June 1993.  His family fled Iraq as refugees in different stages between
1987 and 1995, before reuniting
in this country.  The eldest son of the family
was executed and the head of the family descended, as a consequence, into
alcoholism
and violence.  Although the immediate family have been extremely
close-knit and supportive, they experienced difficulty in settling
in this
country and in being absorbed within their ethnic community, apparently because
they are considered poor and to have different
religious beliefs.
<P>

54	The prisoner has himself had very limited education.  Literacy remains a
problem and his grasp of the English language has been
described as being at
survival level.  He has been largely unemployed, no doubt because of those
language difficulties.  He has no
particular health problems or difficulties
with substance abuse and Dr Shand excluded any form of clinical psychiatric
disorder or
inappropriate emotional reaction to his current situation.  He is
said to be a practising member of his church and by reason of his
age and
marital status, to have been the person upon whom his family leant for
support.
<P>

55	His prior criminal record comprises convictions recorded on 3 June 1994 in
the Local Court at Parramatta on two counts of assault
occasioning actual
bodily harm, for which a recognisance to be of good behaviour for three years
was imposed;  and three counts of
assault, on each of which he was fined $400.
It may be observed that the present offence occurred during the closing months
of this
recognisance, a matter which is itself a circumstance of some
aggravation: <b>Doridis</b> (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales, 18
December 1986, unreported).
<P>

56	There is no particular reason to suppose that the prisoner lacks any
prospects of rehabilitation, although it is difficult, at
this stage, to
determine whether he will make any beneficial use of the lengthy period in
custody which he must face for this offence.
 In that regard the background
report and the evidence of the officer who prepared that report suggests that
he has been somewhat
reluctant to access prison services such as welfare
officers or psychologists, that he does not accept the verdict and that he is
frustrated by the justice system and by what he sees as a wrongful conviction
which he attributes to those who gave untrue evidence
concerning him.
<P>

57	As with his brother, cultural factors and a perhaps not surprising suspicion
of government authorities, are likely to lead to
some resistance on his part in
taking advantage of counselling or support services other than those from
within his family.
<P>

58	Although the prisoner is not to be additionally punished for going to trial,
he is deprived of the benefit of the discount that
would have been attracted in
a case such as the present, by a plea of guilty, or by an offer of assistance
in relation to the remaining
accused.  He has demonstrated no contrition or
remorse for the offence and he maintains his innocence.  The case, however, is
not
one in which the prisoner, on his record, presents as a continuing danger
to society; nor is it one where he would be expected to
serve the sentence on
protection.
<P>

59	I am not satisfied that any matters Constituting special circumstances,
within s 5(2) of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing Act</a></b>, have been identified or established
which would require any departure from the prima facie proportion between the
minimum and additional
terms.  I see no reason to depart from that prima facie
proportion.  The additional term for the sentence proposed is one, which
in my
view, will be adequate to facilitate rehabilitation and I see no advantage
being secured by its extension.
<P>

60		Upon the evidence led in this trial, the involvement of Richard Adam was
far less serious than that of Gilbert Adam, or that
of some of the others who
attacked David Carty in the second phase of the incident.  There is no basis
for inferring that he carried
or use a knife, or that he was in any way aware
of any planned attack on David Carty, or that he was aware of the reason for
the
attack once it began.  However, upon the evidence of Tony Bakos and Dennis
Oshana, he is to be taken as having joined in the second
phase of the attack,
in the course of which he was at least present aiding and encouraging those who
kicked, stomped on and slashed
David Carty.  The evidence of those two
witnesses was supported to the extent that blood, the DNA of which could have
come from David
Carty and could not have come from Thaier Sako or Bashir
Hurmiz, was found on his shoe.
<P>

61	Neither this fact nor the remaining evidence, however, permits me to find
that his culpability arose above that of a person encouraging
and assisting
those who were directly involved in the second phase of the physical assault.
He is to be sentenced upon the basis
that he intended only to cause some bodily
harm to Constable Carty, that harm falling short of grievous bodily harm.  The
offence,
however, remains serious, since he joined in encouraging a vicious and
unprovoked attack by a group of men on a single, defenceless
man who had
collapsed on the ground and was unable to offer any resistance.  In his case I
am unable to find, as established beyond
reasonable doubt, that he knew David
Carty to be a police officer.  While he almost certainly knew the police had
been at the hotel,
the speed with which the incident escalated, and the
confusion in the car park, was such that it is well possible that he was
unaware
of the identity or occupation of the man who, it was said, had stabbed
Thaier Sako.
<P>

62	However, I do find that he knowingly became involved in the fight at a time
when he knew the person on the ground to have been
seriously injured, and
defenceless to resist the large number of men who were attacking him.  
<P>

63	The third of the aggravating circumstances I previously mentioned,
therefore, is applicable to him, although the others are not.
<P>

64	His subjective circumstances are similar to those of his brother.  He is now
thirty-one years of age and he came to Australia
in 1992 as a refugee.  He was
traumatised by the experience relating to the execution of his elder brother,
and his forced army service,
which saw him gaoled in military prisons on three
occasions as a deserter, due to his resistance in being involved in armed
conflict.
 He has three children.  He entered the workforce in Iraq and
although his record of employment in this country is sketchy and sporadic,
he
had worked from time to time before being injured in a work accident.
<P>

65	His family situation is the same as that described by his brother.  In his
case it appears that he was centrally involved in
effecting the escape of some
members of the family from Iraq.  His recreational activities have largely
centred on the Crescent Tavern.
 His alcohol consumption, while not excessive,
does seem on occasions to have been considerable.  He generally impresses as
being
articulate and cooperative, although similarly to his brother, he
maintains his absolute innocence of any offence.
<P>

66	He has had two previous appearances in Local Courts, having been convicted
and sentenced, similarly to his brother, on two counts
of assault occasioning
actual bodily harm, and three counts of assault, on 3 June 1994; and
additionally having been convicted of
mid-range PCA in the Penrith Local Court
on 24 September 1997, for which offence he was fined $500 and disqualified from
driving
for twelve months.  As in the case of his brother, the present offence
was committed while the recognisance to be of good behaviour
was still current.

<P>

67	He has made positive attempts to obtain language skills.  Moreover, while in
custody since December, he has accessed the educational
facilities available,
but not the psychological or alcohol counselling resources that may be of
assistance to him.  Like his brother,
he seems to have some cultural resistance
to seeking counselling or assistance of this kind.
<P>

68	Again, similarly to his brother, this prisoner is denied the discount which
a plea of guilty, or an offer of assistance to the
Crown, would have attracted.
He has demonstrated no remorse or contrition for the offence, of which he
maintains his innocence. 
He does not present as a continuing danger to
society; nor is there any reason to suppose that he will need to serve any part
of
the sentence on protection.  His prospects of rehabilitation are favourable.

<P>

69	Although he is currently showing clinical signs of anxiety, and was
diagnosed by Dr Roberts as suffering from "an adjustment
disorder with a
differentiatial diagnosis of a response to extreme circumstances", that is a
somewhat imprecise and generally uninformative
diagnosis.  It tells me little
as to its significance or consequence.  The symptoms reported seem to me to
have been entirely explicable
by reference to the prisoner's background and his
present circumstances, particularly the separation from his wife and children.
Nothing has been shown to suggest any psychiatric predisposition or propensity
to violence.
<P>

70	I accept that imprisonment will be difficult for each offender, both because
of their background and their relative isolation
within the prison community.
This is a matter which I will take into account in relation to the sentence as
a whole.  I do not consider
it to be a factor which would Constitute a special
circumstance justifying a variation in the usual proportion between the minimum
and additional terms.  In particular, the case is not one where it seems to me
there is a particular advantage in prolonging the
additional term in the
interests of rehabilitation.
<P>

71	Again, in the case of each prisoner, attention has been drawn to the
hardship that imprisonment will occasion to their immediate
families.  This
affects their mother, particularly so far as Gilbert Adam is concerned, since
he will be unable to provide the support
to which she has been accustomed.  In
the case of Richard Adam, it will affect his wife and young children.  They
will miss him and
they do not know that he is in fact in prison.  As the
authorities make clear however, hardship to family and dependants is an
inevitable
consequence of imprisonment, and it is only where exceptional
circumstances exist that such consequences may be taken into account
in
reduction of sentence: <b>T</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2047%20A%20Crim%20R%2029" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 47 A Crim R 29</a>; and <b>Edwards</b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2090%20A%20Crim%20R%20510" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 90 A Crim R 510.</a>  Accordingly as with Gilbert Adam, I am not satisfied
that special circumstances exist within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sa121/" class="autolink_findacts">Sentencing
Act</a></b>.
<P>

72	Those then are the matters which I take into account in determining what
should be the appropriate sentences.
<P>

73	Gilbert Adam, for the offence of murder of which you have been convicted, I
sentence you to a minimum term of penal servitude
for twenty-one years to date
from 17 July 1997, the date on which you were first taken into custody, to
expire on 16 July 2018, and
to an additional term of seven years to date from
17 July 2018.  The earliest date on which you will be eligible for parole is 17
July 2018.
<P>

74	Richard Adam, for the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily
harm, of which you have been convicted, I sentence you
to a minimum term of
penal servitude for two years to date from 24 December 1998 and to expire on 23
December 2000, and to an additional
term of eight months to date from 24
December 2000.  I take into account, but do not consider it necessary to make
any specific adjustment
in respect of, for the period of two days which you
spent in custody before being released to bail.  I direct that you be released
on parole at the end of the minimum term.
<P>

75	I observe that I have taken careful note of the victim impact statements
from members of David Carty's family that were tendered
in the sentencing
proceedings concerning Gilbert Adam (but not Richard Adam), pursuant to s 23C
of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1986188/" class="autolink_findacts">Criminal Procedure Act 1986</a> (New South Wales).  Those statements speak
eloquently of the devastating consequences for the family of David Carty.  They
underline
in strong terms what otherwise would have been apparent from the
evidence, namely that, a decent and dedicated young police officer
lost his
life for no good reason whatsoever in a few moments of violence that was both
inexcusable and wholly unnecessary.  
<P>

76	Nothing that I can say can alter or reduce the extent of that loss;  nor can
anything arising out of this sentence have that
consequence.  I state that when
taking those matters into consideration, I have dealt with them, as was
encouraged by the Crown and
by counsel for Gilbert Adam, for the limited
purpose identified in <b>Previtera</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%2094%20A%20Crim%20R%2076" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 94 A Crim R 76</a> and not for the
purpose of determining what the appropriate sentence should be.  
<P>

77	It would seem to me appropriate for the two prisoners to serve their
sentences together, so as to minimise their isolation, and
to assist Gilbert
Adam to prepare for the long period he must face in custody.  I recommend that
every effort be made to provide
them with opportunities for language skills and
vocational training.
<P>

78	I observe that Constable Michelle Auld behaved in this incident in a
commendable and extremely brave manner in attempting, virtually
single-handedly, to fight off the group of very agitated and aggressive men who
were attacking David Carty, suffering significant
injuries to herself in the
process.  The situation was extremely violent and dangerous, as was testified
to by the several police
and ambulance officers who were themselves abused and
threatened when they were called to the scene.  Notwithstanding the personal
danger they all faced, each continued to treat David Carty and also Thaier
Sako, without regard for their own personal safety.  The
bravery of Constable
Auld, and the professionalism of the uniformed police and detectives, and of
the ambulance officers, should
not pass unnoticed.
<P>

79	I direct that a copy of these reasons for sentence be referred to the
Commissioner of Police and to the Director of Ambulance
Services of New South
Wales for consideration.
