<P>

<b>JUDGMENT - On Application by Drabsch for Relief under Pt 13 r 5 or
alternatively Pt 15 r 26, and by SGI to amend particulars, see
pp 708 and 709
of Transcript</b>
<P>

His Honour:
<P>

1	Application has been made on behalf of the plaintiff in proceedings 3008/93,
Neil Gregory Drabsch ("Drabsch"), for relief under
Pt 13 r 5 or alternatively
Pt 15 r 26 of the Rules of the Supreme Court in relation to portions of the
cross claim against him by
Switzerland General Insurance Co Ltd ("SGI").  That
is currently before me in the form of the sixth further amended first cross
claim
filed on 26 March 1999 ("the cross claim").  A seventh further amended
first cross claim is being brought forward and will, I understand,
without
controversy, be filed in Court in due course, but the differences between the
sixth and seventh versions are, as I understand
it, not material to the
application now before me.
<P>

2	Portions of the cross claim which are material to this application are as
follows.  Par 4 alleges a term of Drabsch's contract
of employment stipulating
the circumstances in which he might be summarily dismissed.  By par 6 of the
cross claim the cross claimant
alleges that the conduct of Drabsch specified in
the schedule to the cross claim constitutes breaches by Drabsch of contractual
obligations
to the cross claimant.  By par 9 it is alleged that by reason of
Drabsch's breaches of his employment contract or other wrongful
acts, SGI
suffered loss and damage and, in particulars appended to that paragraph, it is
alleged that SGI made the payments or incurred
the expenses referred to in,
inter alia, "Item A (both sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) thereof)".  This removal
of matters of detail into
a schedule was at an earlier stage submitted to be
inappropriate, but that proposition was not found to be correct by Windeyer J
in a judgment of 14 November 1997 to which I shall have occasion to return.  In
general terms, I respectfully agree with what his
Honour said:  the removal in
an appropriate way of matters of detail into a schedule may help keep a
pleading a reasonably concise
statement of causes of action or the case sought
to be made out, instead of it being a mishmash of hundreds of pages of
narrative
which does not tell anything very shortly or clearly.
<P>

3	Section A in the schedule is, in this case, headed, "Business Expense
Reimbursement".  It is divided into two sections.  Paragraph
(1) deals, under
six headings, with a comparatively small number of instances of wrongful
reimbursement.  Although these items were
initially complained of by Mr Shand,
of Queen's Counsel for Drabsch, in moving the present motion, he later, if I
may say so, wisely,
withdrew from that and conceded that the matters in (1) had
been pleaded and particularised in a way which was comprehensible and
where it
really was impossible for him to contend that there ought be summary relief of
either of the kinds now sought.  Paragraph
(2) proceeded by reference to what
has become known in this case as the "Item A Table".  That sets out 410
numbered items, most of
them individually small, in respect of which it is said
that Drabsch either took wrongful reimbursement or authorised the taking
of
wrongful reimbursement by McErlane ("McErlane"), also a party to this suit, who
was his predecessor as the CEO of SGI.  In relation
to McErlane's expenses,
Drabsch, although his inferior, as second in command, was the authorising
authority.  The allegation made
in par (2) is as follows:
<P>

"(2)	SGI refers to the Item A table which the pleading incorporates by
reference (comprising 51 pages and dated 18 August 1997)
and says:
<P>

(a)	First of all that the expenses recorded in the Item A table were not
business expenses which ought properly to have been claimed
and/or authorised
as they were not expenses reasonably incurred by Drabsch and/or McErlane in the
course of Drabsch's and/or McErlane's
employment by SGI and/or were not
incurred for and on behalf of SGI and/or were not reasonably necessary for
Drabsch and/or McErlane
to incur or authorise in the performance of their
duties in accordance with the terms and conditions of their employment with
SGI;
and
<P>

(b)	by reason of the matters in (a), the conduct of Drabsch to the extent of
making the claims for reimbursement that he made and
in authorising the
reimbursement of expenses claimed by McErlane was in breach of the obligations
pleaded in Para 4 of the cross
claim (which refers to clause 3(a)(v) of the
1/1/90 written agreement) and/or the implied terms of his Employment
Contract."
<P>

The form of the Item A Table is that it comprises 12 columns in which, in
addition to the item number, are set out the date of the
item; whether it was
incurred by Drabsch or McErlane; whether it was authorised by Drabsch or
McErlane; the item description; the
"attendees" (the bulk of these claims being
for entertainment, and others for travel or car hire); a page number cross
reference
to the supporting documentation; and the type of expense, stipulated
by a tick in boxes in three columns headed "Meal", "Alcohol"
and "Other"
respectively.  In many cases the attendees are not stipulated and, so far as
restaurant meals are concerned, those meals
were claimed by both Drabsch and
McErlane with considerable frequency, so that there were often several
restaurant meals claimed
as entertainment expenses in the one week.
<P>

4	Mr Marshall, of counsel for SGI, has, at my request, in arguing in  support
of the pleading, very usefully prepared a document
headed, "Item A Table
Categories" ("the Categories document").  This, for the first time, so far as I
am aware, comprehensively sorts
the items into 13 categories (with a 14th
category for items no longer pressed).  The categories are not mutually
exclusive, so that
an item may appear in more than one.  Whatever it does, the
Categories document, or some refinement of it, will be extremely useful
in
attempting to deal in a methodical way with this multifarious claim, insofar as
it is allowed to proceed by the judgment that
I am in the process of
delivering.  However, it does other things as well.  It states in narrative
form, under the headings of the
various categories, the way in which those
categories are sought to be made out.  In a number of instances, that again
will be useful
in the conduct of the trial, so far as the Item A Table is
allowed to proceed.  However, the terms of that narrative have, in a number
of
instances, raised a problem.  Mr Shand has said that some of the ways in which
SGI's case in respect of the Item A Table matters
is by the Categories document
sought to be made out are outside the particulars earlier given.  Insofar as
this is so, the case will
not be allowed to proceed on that basis unless an
amendment to the particulars can be obtained at this stage.
<P>

5	In coming to a conclusion on the Pt 13 r 5 and Pt 15 r 26 applications, it is
important that I determine the ambit of the existing
particulars as such
determination is necessary to define the subject matter I am dealing with in
those applications.  There is history
to this matter.  Earlier attempts have
been made by other judicial officers in this Division to deal with the
particulars problem
in this somewhat unruly cross claim.  The matter was dealt
with in one part of a judgment of Master Macready on 1 March 1995.  Probably
no
more need be said about the learned Master's judgment at this stage.  However,
it was again dealt with on 14 November 1997 in
the judgment I have earlier
referred to of Windeyer J.  His Honour said:
<P>

"The other matters in the notice of motion, so far as any claims for
particulars are concerned [sic].  I am not satisfied that any
additional
matters or particularisation is required other than to record that the claim of
the cross claimant is that all the items
in the item A list were expenses which
were not properly claimed.  So that in so far as the notes to the item A table
state that
they were excessive, the claim is not made that any particular item
is for an excessive amount, but rather that the claim is made
that the items
were not properly claimed as business expenses.
<P>

There were complaints to some notes to the item A Table.  Those are, in effect,
argumentative and might lead one to the misconception
that it is not claimed
that all the amounts in the table were not claimed as being inappropriate
expense reimbursements.  The position
is that it is claimed that none of the
items on the account were properly charged up to SGI, as expenses of Mr Drabsch
or were expenses
of McErlane which required authorisation by Mr Drabsch.  In
those circumstances, I have directed that those notes be removed from
the
schedule and that has been done."
<P>

The notes, having been removed, are not before me in the substantive
proceedings.  They have, however, been tendered upon this application.
Paragraph 1 of the notes contains the words:
<P>

"The number of expenses claimed by Drabsch and McErlane in the meal category
over the relevant period were excessive.  In several
cases the claim for
reimbursement was made without the Expense Reimbursement Form being properly
completed as required by Group Standard
12.2."
<P>

6	The material, or formulation of SGI's case, that Mr Shand complains of, is
typified by the narrative relating to restaurant meals
set out under the
heading "Category 12" in the Categories document.  These, incidentally, number
more than 200 out of the 410 items
in the Item A Table.  I shall not set out
that narrative in this judgment nor attempt to state it compendiously.
However, it does
constitute a claim that Drabsch's conduct in relation to
restaurant meals is a breach of contract not simply in taking meals, which
it
is said it will be established by evidence in the case had no business
connection, but by relying on breaches of contract said
to be constituted by
his not filling out, in accordance with the company regulations, claim forms
for the expenses which included
the names of the persons entertained; procuring
reimbursement for the meals without that information entering the company
records;
and authorising expenditures by McErlane for restaurant meals which
suffered the same alleged vices.  It has been submitted that
a case of this
sort has not been pleaded or particularised adequately by the particulars as
they are before me, the essential features
of which I have set out above.  It
seems to me that what fairly may be taken to be alleged by the pleading and
particulars is that
Drabsch in his own case took - and in the case of McErlane
authorised - reimbursement of items of expense which were not truly business
expenses, but expenses of a private nature.  I bear in mind, in saying what I
am about to say, that, on the case as it has been opened,
not only is there
some form of wrapped up allegation of misconduct now sought to be inferred from
these many instances of insufficiently
documented claims, but an actual claim
is made for reimbursement sounding in the judgment of the Court in respect of
each and every
one of the items particularised in the Item A Table.  Bearing
that in mind, it seems to me that the case upon the particulars which
the cross
claimant has communicated to Drabsch and undertaken to prove is that it
established upon the balance of probabilities in
respect of each and every one
of the items that that item was of a private nature and lacking in any business
connection.
<P>

7	In pressing on me that the wider case now sought to be made out should be
regarded as being encompassed in the particulars on
the present state of the
documentation, Mr Marshall has tendered the notes to the Item A Table removed
by Windeyer J, and drawn my
attention to the portion of them set out in [5].
He says that they indicate that a case of the sort that he now seeks to make
out
was in contemplation of the parties and the Court when the matter was in
1997 before Windeyer J and that, read in the light of this
portion from the
removed notes, the judgment of Windeyer J is to be so understood.
<P>

8	I cannot, of course, enter into his Honour's mind.  I must read and construe
his Honour's words objectively.  In reading his Honour's
words and the
documentation which I am now called upon to construe, I must bear in mind the
primary objects of particulars.  One
of those objects that is particularly
material in the present case is that the particulars are to prevent surprise by
giving the
opposing parties sufficient information to make plain to them the
nature of the case that they may be required to meet at the trial:
 see
generally Ritchie's Supreme Court Procedure [16.0.0]; <b>McSpedden v
Harnett</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1942/8.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1942] NSWStRp 8</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281942%29%2042%20SR%28NSW%29%20116" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1942) 42 SR(NSW) 116</a> at 117; <b>Philliponi v Leithead</b> (1959)

Wran</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%201%20NSWLR%20317" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1984] 1 NSWLR 317</a> at 321 - 2.  To prevent surprise and show the case
which is to be made out, particulars must be clear.  They must be clear
primarily
to opposing parties, who may have to meet the evidence led in support
of the allegations made, or themselves lead evidence in answer.
 It is true
that in this case, according to modern practice, much of the evidence to be
brought is available to all sides, before
the trial commences, in the form of
affidavits, which supplant oral evidence-in-chief, and bundles of documents,
which are prepared
in cases such as these, and have been prepared in this case.
Indeed, I already have the benefit of between 10,000 and 20,000 pages
of them.
However, that does not remove the possibility of other evidence being brought
in, in various ways, by the propounding party
during the trial, for instance,
by cross examination of the witnesses of the opposing party, or, indeed other
parties, in this multi-party
litigation.  Even more importantly, where not just
the propounding party's, but everybody's, evidence is directed be brought to
court
ahead of time in written form, the opposing party must know just what
evidence it needs to bring.  Otherwise it may be prevented
from bringing that
evidence by the Court's very practice of requiring evidence in chief of
witnesses to be made available in written
form ahead of time.  Orders
precluding the calling of additional evidence in chief at a late point of time
are certainly not an unknown
feature of litigation in these days, as opposed to
the practice in the old days, when no party, even in commercial actions, had to
specify its witnesses ahead of time and could simply call viva voce whatever
witnesses it desired to call, up to the close of its
case.  To me, the
significance of the notes to the Item A Table is, not so much what they contain
as perhaps reflecting upon somebody's
state of mind in 1997, but that they were
at that time removed from the record by Windeyer J, and are not part of the
record as it
now is before me.  What matters most is the record as it is now
before me, rather than anything that Windeyer J said in giving reasons
for an
interlocutory judgment in November 1997.  It seems to me that upon the proper
reading of par A(2) of the schedule to the cross
claim, looking at the words
themselves, and bearing in mind the conjunction between sub-pars (a) and (b)
required by the word  "and"
at the end of sub-par (a) and the opening words of
sub-par (b) "by reason of the matters in (a)", the burden of the complaint is
that each of the items in the Item A Table was itself a private expense without
any or any sufficient relation to the business of
the company to justify its
being charged to the company's account.
<P>

9	Those are the particulars on which the matter has been brought to trial.  In
my view, it was not plain that there was some case
that SGI intended to bring
by reference to the Item A Table, beyond that which I have stated above.  Nor,
fairly reading my brother
Windeyer's judgment of November 1997, do I see that
his Honour's words indicate otherwise.  Indeed, read in the context of his
Honour's
direction of the removal of the notes, in my view, insofar as it
matters, his Honour's words support rather than detract from the
view that I
have just expressed.  Let me make it clear that the core of the view by
reference to which I am proceeding is that it
was not on the documents made
plain to Drabsch or, indeed, to McErlane, who is also a party to the suit and
concerned in the Item
A Table matters, that  a case of unsatisfactory procedure
or practice, or arising from the sheer bulk of expenses in some particular
period, was of itself to be relied on to make out a case of breach of contract
or breach of duty against either of them.  I also
bear squarely in mind that I
am informed by Mr Shand that counsel did not come to Court prepared to meet
such a case.  I have no
reason, of course, to doubt that that is so.  And it is
hardly surprising that it is so, upon the understanding of the particulars
which I have set out above as being, in my view, what they convey.
<P>

10	I now turn to the application made by Mr Shand in the light of this
constricted view of the case able to be made out under the
Item A Table.  This
application, on behalf of Drabsch, is made late in the proceedings.  Unlike the
rules in some other courts, the
Rules of this Court do not impose any
limitation as to the time at which an application for summary dismissal, or,
indeed, the striking
out of pleadings or parts, may be made.   Nonetheless, it
is usual for such applications to be made at an earlier time than a quarter
of
the way through the trial.  It should, however, be said in fairness to Drabsch,
and those advising him, that they have not been,
up to this point of time,
silent about the problem.  The matter came to me for case management, at a late
stage, after I had been
assigned to it as the trial Judge.  It is not necessary
to go into detail, but in directions hearings before me difficulties arising
out of this same subject matter were agitated.  They were debated when an order
of trial was being  established.  Mr Shand was desirous
that SGI's case on its
cross claim have all the evidence upon it presented before Drabsch was
available to be cross examined, and
that, in part, by reference to the problems
arising from features of the Item A Table which are now under discussion.  I
made it
plain that I should not accede to ordering the trial to permit that to
occur.  Another reason, perhaps, why the application has been
made now rather
than earlier, is because, now the affidavits have essentially all been read and
the bulk of the written material
tendered, it is plain what material there is
in support of SGI's Item A Table case, whether viewed in the more constricted
way that
I have ruled it should be viewed or viewed in the broader way in which
Mr Marshall has sought to put it.
<P>

11	All I need say about the timing of this application is that I should not and
do not refuse it simply by reference to the time
at which it is brought.
However, applications for summary dismissal are difficult to succeed in
whenever brought.  The principles
have been laid down in the High Court in
cases such as <b>Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281949%29%2078%20CLR%20672" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1949) 78 CLR 672</a>;
<b>General Steel Industries Inc v The Commissioner for Railways (NSW)</b>
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1964/69.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1964] HCA 69</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281964%29%20112%20CLR%20125" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1964) 112 CLR 125</a> and <b>Webster v Lampard </b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1993] HCA 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%20177%20CLR%20598" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 177 CLR 598.</a>  They were,
in my view, felicitously summarised by Charles JA in the Victorian Court of
Appeal in <b>Coles Myers Ltd v Bowman</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1996/32.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] VICSC 219</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%201%20VR%20457" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1996] 1 VR 457</a> at 459.  The
additional difficulties that stand in the way of the success of summary
dismissal applications in multi-defendant or
multi-party cases, such as this
is, were adumbrated in the New South Wales Court of Appeal in <b>Wickstead v
Browne </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2030%20NSWLR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 30 NSWLR 1</a>, esp per Handley and Cripps JJA at 11-12.  I am
the trial Judge in this matter and the trial is under way.  It is not desirable
that
I express unnecessarily any views about the strength or weakness of
material in this matter.  In the light of that exigency I intend
to say no more
than that, in my view, looking at the claim or part of the claim attacked, upon
the constricted basis on which I have
ruled that it may proceed, I am not of
the view that it is so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly succeed.  By
reason of that
conclusion, I propose to dismiss Drabsch's application under Pt
13 r 5.  Whilst applications in relation to claims under Pt 15 r
26 in respect
of the same pleading sometimes turn on rather different considerations from
summary dismissal applications, I do not
think that that is so in this case.
In this case the conclusion that I have come to upon the tenability of the
portions of the claim
attacked leads also to the conclusion that the relevant
portions of the pleading and particulars appended to it are not so embarrassing
that they ought be struck out and the application to strike out any portion of
the cross claim is therefore also refused.
<P>

12	The orders of the Court are:
<P>

(1)	I grant to the plaintiff leave to file in Court in proceedings 3008/93 the
notice of motion dated 17 May 1999.
<P>

13	Mr Marshall now applies to have the Categories document, which was put in
evidence in Drabsch's application for summary dismissal
and to strike out,
stand as further particulars of the SGI case under the first cross claim in the
proceedings.  He applies alternatively
that SGI be allowed to expand in some
other way, if some other way be deemed more suitable, its particulars so as to
permit a case
to be made out by it as set out in the Categories document, going
beyond the pleading and particulars as they stand.  I have already
traversed,
in dealing with Drabsch's application this morning, the history of these
particulars.  The view that I have expressed
is that the particulars, as they
stand after being dealt with by Windeyer J on 14 November 1997, could not be
fairly read as giving
notice of a case of the kind now sought to be made out.
The matter proceeded from November 1997 to the commencement of the trial
before
me late in April 1999 without any attempt to enlarge the particulars or give
notice in any clear way of the claim now sought
to be made.  It may well be
that claims of the type now propounded would necessitate the bringing of
further evidence on behalf of
Drabsch, and perhaps on behalf of McErlane also.
I am of the view that, if this amendment were allowed and an adjournment of the
trial were sought on behalf of other parties, it would have to be granted.
Although I wish to say as little as possible concerning
the merits of any part
of the matter, speaking only of the additional claims now sought to be put
forward, I see considerable difficulty
in their way upon the material now
before me, which is the bulk of the written material to be presented in the
case.  Bearing in
mind the time that has passed and all the circumstances of
the matter, I do not think it appropriate to allow the particulars to
be
enlarged in this way at the present time.  The application made by Mr Marshall
on behalf of SGI is refused.  Costs of that application
also are reserved.
