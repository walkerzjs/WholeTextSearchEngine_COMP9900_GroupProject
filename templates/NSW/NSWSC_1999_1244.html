<P>

<b>HER HONOUR  :</b>
<P>

1   	The plaintiff, JW,  who was born on 29 September 1981 and
who is now eighteen years of age, is charged with one count of break
enter and
steal in circumstances of aggravation (under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s112.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 112(3)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/" class="autolink_findacts">Crimes Act
1900</a>) </i>and with the murder of Ralph Terrence Mason.  Both offences are
alleged to have been committed on the same day, 11 January 1999, at
Berkeley.
Committal proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a> </i>("the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>") to take
place in 2000 involve both the plaintiff and another juvenile, TP, jointly
charged with the plaintiff.  A broad overview
of the prosecution case is to be
found in a police fact sheet.  Put shortly, the prosecution case is that, a
little after midnight
on 11 January, the plaintiff, with a number of other
young men, went to Mr Mason's house with the intention of stealing a video
recorder.
 They were wearing balaclavas.  The plaintiff was armed with a knife.
A struggle took place during which Mr Mason was stabbed a number
of times as a
result of which he died.  Crown witnesses assert that it was the plaintiff who
stabbed Mr Mason and that he also hit
Mr Mason on the head a number of times
with a steel bar.
<P>

2   	During the course of the present proceedings I was told
that the plaintiff had participated in an electronically recorded interview
in
which he admitted to having been present at or about the time of the death.
<P>

3   	Pursuant <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/index.html#p4" class="autolink_findacts">Pt 4</a>, Division 1, Sub-Division 7A of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Act</a>, the
prosecution has served on the plaintiff a number of statements of witnesses
whom it proposes to call at a trial in the event
that the plaintiff is
committed for trial.  The plaintiff's legal representatives sought directions
pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48</a> E (2)(b) that the signatories of ten of the statements attend
for cross-examination.  With the exception of one such witness the
magistrate,
the second defendant, refused to direct attendance.  The one witness whose
attendance the magistrate did direct is CP,
a brother of TP, the plaintiff's
co-accused.
<P>

4   	By summons filed on 8 September 1989 the plaintiff
challenges that decision, claiming a declaration that the second defendant
was
in error in rejecting the application for the directions, and an order that he
re-consider the applications according to law.
 The source of power relied upon
for the orders sought is <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s69.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 69</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act 1970</a> </i>which
abolishes the jurisdiction of this Court to grant writs, but preserves its
jurisdiction to make orders of that nature.  It is
well established that an
order for mandamus (or an order in the nature of an order for mandamus) will be
made only where the magistrate
has failed to perform the duty imposed upon him.
The same limitations apply to the power to make a declaration of the kind
claimed.
 Such failure may be demonstrated by the application of an incorrect
test or a misunderstanding of the nature of the opinion the
magistrate must
reach in order to decide the question before him or her:  <b>Ex parte Hebburn
Limited</b>; <b>re Kearsley Shire Council</b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1947/24.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1947] NSWStRp 24</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281947%29%2047%20SR%20%28NSW%29%20416" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1947) 47 SR (NSW) 416</a>;
<b>Saffron  v  DPP </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2016%20NSWLR%20397" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1989) 16 NSWLR 397.</a>
<P>

5   	S 48E(2)(b) provides that a direction to a witness to
attend for cross-examination may be given, relevantly, only where the
magistrate is of the opinion that there are substantial reasons why, in the
interests of justice, the witness should attend to give
oral evidence.
Obviously, individual consideration must be given to every witness in respect
of whom an application for a direction
is made, and to the basis on which the
application is made:  see <b>Hanna  v  Kearney</b>;  <b>Mileshkin  v
Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions,</b> unreported, 28 May 1998, per
Studdert J. 
<P>

6   	The ambit of s 48E(2)(b) has at least twice been considered
by this Court, and at least once by the Court of Appeal: <b>Hanna</b>, supra;
<b>Charles Losurdo</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%20101%20A%20Crim%20R%20162" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 101 A Crim R 162</a>, per Hidden J;  and on appeal,
<b>Director of Public Prosecutions  v  Losurdo</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2044%20NSWLR%20618" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 44 NSWLR 618.</a>
<P>

7   	It is not possible to define the boundaries of "substantial
reasons" in this context:  <b>Losurdo, </b>C of A, pp 622, 632.  A potential
narrowing of the issues to be determined at trial, if the defendant is
committed, is within the
term;  so also is the possibility of establishing the
foundation for a challenge to the admission or admissibility of  evidence
(<b>Hanna </b>p 8;  <b>Losurdo</b>, C of A pp 631-2);  the possibility of
significantly undermining the credibility of a Crown witness (<b>Losurdo, </b>C
of A p 631);  clarification of the evidence proposed to be called so as to
avoid a defendant being taken by surprise at a trial
(<b>Losurdo</b>, C of A, p
631); and the opportunity of gaining relatively precise knowledge of the case
against the defendant (<b>Hanna, </b>p 5).
<P>

8   	There may well be other reasons, that qualify as
substantial, for a direction that a witness attend for cross-examination.
 It
has to be borne in mind, as Hidden J pointed out in <b>Losurdo</b> at first
instance, that a properly conducted committal might benefit the prosecution as
much as the defence.  While a successful
attempt to undermine the credit of a
Crown witness would benefit the defence, an unsuccessful attempt to do so could
result in the
decision of an accused person to plead guilty.  In my opinion
exploring the strength of the Crown case is, at least to a point, a
legitimate
objective of cross-examination at committal, although defendants plainly cannot
be given the unbridled rein they previously
had.  The significance of the
evidence to be adduced from a particular witness in the Crown case is clearly a
relevant consideration.
<P>

9   	Assessment of what is sought to be achieved by
cross-examination is an important aspect of the decision making process.  This
is because the objective may vary in relation to different witnesses.  That is
why it is necessary for the magistrate to consider
the reasons advanced in
support of the application individually in relation to each of the witnesses in
respect of whom a direction
is sought.  Balanced against those reasons must be
the clear intention of the legislature to limit the excessive time taken and
inconvenience
to witnesses that had, it has been said, in the past attended the
conduct of committal proceedings uninhibited by the regime provided
by s
48E.
<P>

10   	The statements of the various witnesses in question were
put before me.  A number of the witnesses were, at the time of their
statements, under eighteen years of age, and I propose to refer to them by
initials.  Also put before me were written submissions
made on behalf of the
plaintiff, TP, and the prosecution in relation to the application before the
magistrate.  In the submissions
made on behalf of the plaintiff the prosecution
witnesses whose attendance was sought were divided into five categories and the
reasons
contended to be substantial were identified.  The five categories of
witnesses were:
<P>

1.	Three young male witnesses, each of whom gives an account of a conversation
or conversations with TP, in each of which, to a
greater or lesser extent, TP
seriously implicated the plaintiff.  The admissibility of the evidence in the
form in which it appears
in the statements is questionable, but its exclusion
is certainly not beyond doubt:  see <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a></i>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s65.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 65</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s66.html" class="autolink_findacts">66</a>, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">135</a>,
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">137</a>;  and <b> R  v  Crisologo </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=99%20A%20Crim%20R%20178" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">99 A Crim R 178.</a>  More significantly, two of
these witnesses (DH and DM) both relate conversations with the plaintiff from
which adverse inferences
might be drawn by a jury.
<P>

In the written submissions, counsel then appearing for the plaintiff argued
that, in four respects, substantial reasons existed
for a direction that these
three witnesses attend for cross-examination.  The reasons advanced were that
the plaintiff ought have
the opportunity to "test the circumstances of the
conversations", to explore the likelihood that the accounts were tainted by
reason
of the age of the witnesses, or by their association either with the
plaintiff or with TP, to test the reliability of the accounts
and the
possibility of bias on the part of the witnesses towards the plaintiff, and to
test the accounts allegedly given by TP to
the witnesses in the light of his
clear interest in casting the blame for Mr Mason's death on the plaintiff.
<P>

2	A young man, CP, who is TP's brother.  This was the sole witness  who the
magistrate directed to attend to give oral evidence
and there is therefore no
need further to consider this category.
<P>

3.	A single witness, the plaintiff's mother.  Her statement contains evidence
that is of a hearsay nature derived originally from
the plaintiff's father, to
which it is intended to object.  However, as with the evidence contained in
parts of the statements of
witnesses in category 1, there can be no guarantee
that the objection will be successful.  The evidence, if admitted, has
potential
significantly to further the Crown case against the plaintiff.  The
basis on which the witnesses' attendance was sought was to test
the reliability
of the evidence, and the reliability of the representations from the original
source, the plaintiff's father.
<P>

4.	Two witnesses, both young women.  In each case the evidence to be adduced is
contained, not in a statement, but in a transcript
of an electronically
recorded interview.  Having been taken in that form, no attempt has been made
to compress the content of the
evidence into admissible form, and it is
diffuse, and in some respects imprecise and confused.  If admitted, this
evidence, too,
could advance the Crown case significantly and support an
inference that the plaintiff was motivated to do harm to Mr Mason, and
indeed
intended to do so.  Attendance of these witnesses was sought in order to test
the strength and weaknesses of their evidence.
 
<P>

5.	Two police officers, one of whom was the officer responsible for
interviewing the plaintiff, the other of whom examined the house
where Mr
Mason's death occurred and observed his body, and a medical practitioner who
reported on Mr Mason's injuries, and expressed
an opinion as to the cause of
death.  The reason given to the magistrate for seeking to cross-examine these
witnesses related to
the desire to explore the detail of the events that must
have taken place, and the circumstances in which Mr Mason died.
<P>

11   	After considering these applications, the magistrate gave
reasons for his decision.  In granting the application in relation
to CP, he
said that this witness "more than any other could be seen as sheeting blame for
these proceedings directly home to the
[plaintiff]."  
<P>

12   	In relation to a police officer, Detective Stanley, the
magistrate said:
<P>

"I doubt that that is likely to have the critical effect of, particularly, of
leading either to the conviction or discharging of
the defendant either at
committal or trial level.
<P>

It is one building block in the wall that the prosecution will seek to build.
To my mind it is not a block whose absence will necessarily
cause the wall to
fall."
<P>

13   	The magistrate then referred to the decisions in <b>Hanna
</b>and <b>Losurdo</b>, before turning to the applications in relation to the
remaining witnesses.  He dealt with these applications in a global fashion
saying:
<P>

"In relation to the remaining witnesses sought to be called both in the case of
[the plaintiff] and [TP], [counsel for the Director]
submits, and this might be
said in a broad sense for each of the s 48E applications, that the applicant
has not within the meaning
of Hidden J's words clearly defined the purpose or
purposes of the cross-examination which he seeks.
<P>

...
<P>

Bearing in mind that the pivotal witness seems to me to be [CP] to whom, in
respect of an admission allegedly made by [the plaintiff]
I find substantial
reasons in respect of him, but in respect of each of the remaining witnesses I
am not satisfied that the defendants
have established substantial reasons for
any of the remaining witnesses.
<P>

Each of those witnesses give relatively small amounts of evidence.  There is
no, except perhaps for [CP] with whom I have dealt,
there doesn't seem to be
any one witness who comes forward with an overwhelming case for the
prosecution, upon whom the prosecution
must stand or fall.
<P>

...
<P>

It is often difficult for the defence to [establish substantial reasons],
because it requires a distinction between those witnesses
who are the ordinary
witnesses who will be called in to prove the various bits of a prosecution
case, and those who really go to
a key issue.  
<P>

To my mind [CP] is the only one that I can find as falling within that
category."
<P>

14   	There followed a short discussion between the magistrate
and the legal representatives, after which the magistrate added the
following:
<P>

"In coming to those decisions I am rather conscience (sic) of the fact the
time, I have not read out on to the record every single
submission that either
the prosecution or the defence have made, and I make it quite clear that they
were received by me, certainly
in respect of the defence submissions, in
sufficient time for me to read in detail and I have indeed done so.
<P>

...
<P>

It should not be thought that if I have not commented on a specific submission
here or there that it is overlooked, but rather that
I am incorporating into my
reasons given today, I make this quite clear, the submissions which each side
have made.  They have been
considered and they are incorporated in my reasons,
it is not that I have simply said that I am making up my mind purely on what
I
have read into it myself.
<P>

The decision I have come to incorporates the submissions made, and it is the
decision on those submissions ..."
<P>

15   	Counsel for the plaintiff argued that the various passages
extracted show that the magistrate failed to give individual attention
to the
witness statements, or to the individual applications;  and, further, that he
set too high a barrier for the plaintiff, or,
put differently, he applied an
excessively difficult test to the disadvantage of the plaintiff.  
<P>

16   	Counsel for the Director argued that, read as a whole, and
particularly when regard is had to the supplementary remarks, the
reasons do
not support the contention that the magistrate failed to consider the
statements or the argument in relation to each witness
individually.  The fact
that he delivered reasons globally does not necessarily mean that he failed to
give individual consideration
to the purposes of the cross-examination outlined
in the written submissions.
<P>

17   	I am not satisfied that the magistrate failed to give
appropriately individual attention to the statements of various witnesses
and
the stated objectives of the plaintiff's legal representatives in pursuing the
opportunity to cross-examine.  Comprehensive written
submissions were placed
before the magistrate by all parties, and he made some reference to those in
passages in the judgment not
extracted above.   In my opinion, even leaving
aside the supplementary remarks, references such as "there doesn't seem to be
any
one witness who comes forward with an overwhelming case ... upon whom the
prosecution must stand or fall", and the distinction drawn
between "ordinary
witnesses" and "those who really go to a key issue" point to a conclusion that
the magistrate did give appropriate
consideration to the statements of each of
the witnesses.  I reject the contention that he failed in his duty in this
respect.
<P>

18   	I have concluded, however, that the argument that the
magistrate applied a wrong test is made out.  The fact that he did so
emerges,
in my opinion quite clearly, from some of the passages extracted above.  In
dealing with the witness CP, the magistrate
identified him as a witness who:

<P>

"more than any other could be seen as sheeting blame for these proceedings
directly home to the defendant".
<P>

19   	Dealing with the evidence of Detective Stanley, the
magistrate doubted:
<P>

"that that is likely to have the critical effect of ... leading either to the
conviction or discharging the defendant either at
committal or trial level."
<P>

20   	He considered that Detective Stanley's evidence was:
<P>

"one building block in the wall that the prosecution will seek to build ... not
a block whose absence will necessarily cause the
wall to fall."
<P>

21   	At another point in the judgment the magistrate referred
to the "relatively small amount of evidence" to be given by the individual
witnesses, and said that there did not seem to be any one witness upon whose
evidence "the prosecution must stand or fall."
<P>

22   	Finally, he drew a distinction between "ordinary
witnesses" and "those who really go to a key issue".  It is significant he
identified CP as the only one within the category of "those who really go to a
key issue", and this was the only witness in respect
of whom he gave a
direction.
<P>

23   	In <b>Hanna</b>, Studdert J expressly noted that it would
be wrong to limit "substantial reasons" to situations where cross-examination
is likely
to result in the discharge of the defendant or to establish grounds
for a no bill application, or those where cross-examination is
likely
substantially to undermine the credit of an important witness.
<P>

24   	Yes a fair reading of the magistrate's remarks in the
present case, in my opinion, demonstrates that the test he imposed included
"the critical effect of ... leading either to the conviction or discharging the
defendant either at committal or trial level", witnesses
who "come forward with
an overwhelming case for the prosecution, upon whom the prosecution must stand
or fall", and witnesses "who
really go to a key issue."  There are, as I have
noted above, many legitimate purposes of cross-examination at committal
proceedings
which fall short, and very far short, of meeting these tests.  In
my opinion, and with respect to him, the magistrate erroneously
directed
himself in relation to the task permitted to him by s 48E(2)(b).  Accordingly,
I propose to make the orders sought.
<P>

1.	I declare that, on 2 July 1999, the second defendant erred in rejecting
applications for the attendance at committal proceedings
of witnesses pursuant
so <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/s48e.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48E</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/ja1902119/" class="autolink_findacts">Justices Act 1902</a>.  </i>
<P>

2.	I order that the second defendant reconsider the application according to
law.
