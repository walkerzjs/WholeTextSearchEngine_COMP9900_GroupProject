COMMON LAW DIVISION
<P>

MASTER MALPASS
<P>

FRIDAY 30 JULY 1999
<P>

<u>11084/1999</u>	<u>MICHAEL JOHN VAUGHAN v ROBERT FULTON DRIVER</u>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1  	The Court has been informed that this is the third of three
proceedings brought in this Court between these parties.  This is
the second of
two proceedings that have come before me.  Both have involved a challenge to a
determination of a Costs Assessor by
the present plaintiff.  Both have involved
modest sums.
<P>

2  	In this case, the Certificate of Determination was issued on 5
June 1997.  The Costs Assessor was Mr Buckworth.
<P>

3  	The plaintiff is a solicitor.  The defendant is a barrister.  The
defendant had been briefed by the plaintiff in respect of
a number of matters.
At some stage, there was an acrimonious falling out between the parties.  The
defendant rendered Memoranda of
Fees in respect of a number of matters.  There
was non-payment.
<P>

4  	The defendant made application to this Court for the assessment
of his fees in respect of a number of matters.  The Certificate
of
Determination allowed fees in the sum of $12,835.00 in respect of those
matters.  For present purposes, the Court is only concerned
with two of the
matters.  The first of them is that of Camilleri.  The second, is that of
Cucchiaro.  In each of the matters, fees
were rendered in the sum of $340.00.
The Costs Assessor allowed in full the fees in each of those matters.  In each
of those matters,
the defendant had been briefed in relation to proceedings in
the Compensation Court.
<P>

5  	These proceedings were commenced by Summons.  The Summons was not
filed until 6 May 1999.  The Summons purports to mount a challenge
to the whole
of the determination.  It contains prayers for relief which would appear to
contemplate that the Summons had been brought
pursuant to both <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208l.html" class="autolink_findacts">sections 208L</a>
and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">208M</a> of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act</u> 1987</a> (the Act).
<P>

6  	The Summons came on for hearing on 15 July 1999.  Both parties
were represented by counsel.  The plaintiff has relied on two
affidavits.  The
parties have tendered documentation (Exhibits A and 1).
<P>

7  	The Court has been told that all fees have been paid save for
those rendered in the matters of Camilleri and Cucchiaro.  Accordingly,
the
dispute now only involves the exceedingly modest sum of $680.00.  The Court has
been informed that the plaintiff now seeks relief
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s208m.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 208M</a> of the Act
only.  This is a provision which allows the Court to grant leave to appeal in
an appropriate case.  The Court has a discretionary
power and the power is
exercised in those circumstances where it is just to do so.  The onus of
demonstrating an entitlement to relief
rests with the plaintiff.
<P>

8  	In this case, the summons has been brought well out of time (in
the order of nearly two years).  Accordingly the plaintiff needs
an extension
of time to bring the application for leave.
<P>

9  	There is no formal process seeking an extension of time.  Despite
this, the Court was asked to embark on a hearing of both the
application for
extension and the application for leave.  By consent, both applications were
heard together.
<P>

10  	The Court has a discretionary power to extend time.  It is
exercised having regard to the relevant circumstances of the particular
case
before it.  Three relevant circumstances were agitated in argument.  Firstly,
there was the question of utility in the granting
of leave.  Secondly, there
was the question of delay and the explanation offered for that delay.  Thirdly,
there was the question
of prejudice occasioned by that delay.
<P>

11  	The question of utility involved the consideration of one point
only.  It involved the construction of section 122 of the <u><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/" class="autolink_findacts">Workers
Compensation Act</u> 1987</a>.  Although this section has now been repealed, it was
in force at the relevant time.  The provisions of the section were as
follows:-
<P>

"(1)	The solicitor or agent of a person claiming compensation under this act is
not entitled
<P>

(a)	to recover from the person any costs in respect of the claim;  or
<P>

(b)	to claim a lien in respect of those costs on, or deduct those costs from
the sum awarded, ordered or agreed as compensation,
<P>

unless those costs are awarded by the Compensation Court.
<P>

(2)	Any such award may be made on the application either of the person claiming
compensation or the person's solicitor or agent.
<P>

(3)	Any sum so awarded is subject to assessment in accordance with Division 6
of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p11" class="autolink_findacts">Part 11</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act 1987</a>.
<P>

(4)	This section prevails to the extent of any inconsistency with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/index.html#p11" class="autolink_findacts">Part 11</a> of
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/" class="autolink_findacts">Legal Profession Act 1987</a>.
<P>

(5)	A person must not:
<P>

(a)	claim a lien that the person is not entitled to claim because of subsection
(1);  or
<P>

(b)	deduct costs from a sum awarded, ordered or agreed as compensation that the
person is not entitled to deduct because of subsection
(1).
<P>

Maximum penalty:  50 penalty units.
<P>

(6)	A person who has paid an amount in respect of costs to another person that
the other person was not entitled to recover because
of subsection (1) is
entitled to recover the amount paid as a debt in a court of competent
jurisdiction or by proceedings in the
Compensation Court.
<P>

(7)	A reference in this section to a claim includes a reference to a
prospective claim (whether or not the claim is ever actually
made)."
<P>

12  	The Court has been informed that the term "agent" is not defined
in the legislation.  Further, it was informed that counsel
were unaware of any
decided case which dealt with the matter of the construction of the section.
Accordingly, I was not referred
to any authority to assist in its
construction.
<P>

13  	It appears to be common ground that the defendant had been
briefed in and had performed work in both of the Camilleri and Cucchiaro
matters.  The matter of Camilleri had been finally disposed of prior to the
determination of the Costs Assessor.  By consent, an
award had been made in
favour of the respondent.  In the case of the matter of Cucchiaro, it remained
extant at the time of the determination.
 It appears that the matter of
Cucchiaro was disposed of just recently prior to this hearing.  The Court has
been informed that it
had been struck out by reason of non-appearance of the
applicant.
<P>

14  	The task of scrutinising what has been done by the Costs
Assessor is now a matter of some difficulty.  The delay has seen the
loss of
relevant documentation.  It is common ground that the Costs Assessor's file is
no longer available.  Presumably, it was disposed
of some time after the appeal
period had elapsed.  Largely, the defendant's documentation is no longer
available.  In the circumstances,
there has to be uncertainty as to what took
place during the cost assessment process (inter alia, the communications
involving the
parties and the Costs Assessor, which would have included the
relevant submissions, are not all available).
<P>

15  	It is common ground that the matter of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 122</a> was raised by
the plaintiff.  There is a copy of a letter dated 29 April 1997 from the
defendant to the Costs Assessor.  It may be
seen as having the effect of
raising submissions contrary to whatever was the proposition put by the
plaintiff in relation to the
application of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 122.</a>
<P>

16  	The terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 122</a> (1) disentitle the solicitor or agent
of a person claiming compensation under the legislation from recovering from
that person any
cost in respect of the claim unless those costs are awarded by
the Compensation Court.
<P>

17  	In the present case, the Costs Assessor was concerned with a
bill of costs given by a barrister to a solicitor <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s201.html" class="autolink_findacts">(section 201).</a>  The relevant
relationship was one between solicitor and barrister (not a relationship
between the applicant and his solicitor or
agent).
<P>

18  	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/lpa1987179/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 122</a> does not purport to regulate arrangements made as to
costs between a solicitor and a barrister.  The material is silent as to what
arrangements were made between them in the matters of Camilleri and Cucchiaro
and what was put to the Costs Assessor by the plaintiff
(if anything) in
relation to the existing arrangements.  It has not been argued and there is
nothing to suggest that the defendant
had accepted the brief on a no win/no fee
basis.
<P>

19  	In the circumstances, I am of the view that the Costs Assessor
made a determination in respect of both matters which was open
to him.  I am
not satisfied that there was any error on his part which justifies disturbing
the determination.
<P>

20  	Clearly, no good purpose would be served by the granting of an
extension of time in this case.  The application for leave would
be doomed to
failure.  Whilst this matter alone would suffice to dispose of both
applications, I shall now turn to the remaining
questions.
<P>

21  	The delay is substantial.  It is not satisfactorily explained.
The material offered is parsimonious.  I shall specifically
refer to a couple
of matters.
<P>

22  	By July 1997, the defendant had made it abundantly plain to the
plaintiff that he would be proceeding to recover the costs
allowed under the
determination (if they were not paid by the stipulated date).  He had brought
the plaintiff's attention to the
appellate provisions contained in the Act.  It
should have then been obvious to the plaintiff that if he desired to disturb
the determination
in some way it was up to him to use that appellate process.
Instead of taking that course, at some unspecified time thereafter he
chose to
make a complaint to the Bar Association.  Apparently, it was not disposed of
until March 1999.  Enforcement action taken
in the Local Court by the
defendant, led to the making of an application in that Court.  The plaintiff
was given a stay for a period
of two months.  The Summons was not filed until
that two month period was about to expire.
<P>

23  	The delay has occasioned prejudice.  I have already adverted to
the difficulty that has been caused by reason of loss of documentation.
 The
documentation may have contained material which would have been of assistance
to the defendant on the hearing of these applications.
 It is certainly now
difficult to give the parties a fair hearing in relation to the present
applications.
<P>

24  	In my view, the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the Court that
he should have either an extension of time to bring the application
for leave
or leave itself.  In these circumstances, both applications fail.
<P>

25  	I dismiss the Summons.  The plaintiff is to pay the costs of the
Summons.  The exhibits may be returned.
<P>
