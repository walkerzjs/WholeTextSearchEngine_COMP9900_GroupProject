<b><u>11801/99  -  OLGA YVONNE SMITH  v  STATE CORONER OF NSW</u></b>
<P>

<b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b>
<P>

1   	HIS HONOUR:  These proceedings are before the court
pursuant to a summons in which Olga Yvonne Smith is the plaintiff and the
State
Coroner of New South Wales is the defendant.  The orders significantly sought
by the summons are that, in effect, a Mr Carl
Hughes be permitted to attend and
take photographs at the post-mortem examination of the late Bernard Edmund
Smith who died last
Saturday and whose widow the plaintiff is.
<P>

2   	It is convenient to sketch some matters.  On Tuesday last
application was made to me as Duty Judge for leave to file a summons
and for
the usual collateral orders as to abridgment of time seeking similar orders to
today in which proposed proceedings Mr Carl
Hughes was to be the plaintiff.  As
I have indicated a summons was issued in which Mrs Smith is the plaintiff.  It
was foreshadowed
at the hearing two days ago that there may be an application
to substitute her as plaintiff and no point arises out of this but I
recount it
merely as a matter of history.
<P>

3   	On that occasion I indicated to counsel, who is not counsel
appearing today, that the nature of the orders sought raised a
question of my
jurisdiction or the source of my jurisdiction to make them.  Upon the summons
being called on for hearing today the
plaintiff has read the affidavit of Carl
Ferguson Hughes sworn 28 July 1999.  Mr Hughes' affidavit has been read without
objection.
It was indicated that should the matter proceed counsel for the
defendant wished to cross-examine him but that it was desired to
raise a
preliminary question as to whether the matter should, in any event, proceed
further.  
<P>

4   	As I understand it the totality of the evidence relied upon
by the plaintiff is contained in the affidavit of Mr Hughes.  He
states that he
is a graduate holding degrees of Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery and
Bachelor of Medical Science.  He does
not claim to be a duly registered medical
practitioner. He indicates that for the past ten years he worked as a forensic
consultant
and as such has attended many post mortems.  He was approached by
relatives of the deceased Bernard Edmund Smith and asked whether
he would
attend the post-mortem as an independent observer and take photographs. An
authority signed by the plaintiff is exhibited
to his affidavit.  The family
concern would appear to arise from circumstances related to Mr Hughes by a son
of the deceased that
his father was aged sixty three years and in apparent good
health, coupled with the circumstance that the family doctor had declined
to
sign a death certificate.  The death was apparently very sudden.
<P>

5   	The first thing that needs to be observed is that there is
no express statutory source of power for me to make the orders sought.
 In
response to motion for dismissal by counsel for the defendant, counsel for the
plaintiff adverted to the administrative law powers
of the court and submitted
that, in effect, what was being challenged was the failure of the deputy
coroner to discharge what was
asserted to be her duty to give a direction in
relation to the application made by Mr Hughes to attend and observe the
post-mortem.
<P>

6   	There is evidence in his affidavit that he spoke to Miss
Jan Stevenson, a deputy state coroner, who amongst other things said
to him:
<P>

"It is up to the pathologist carrying out the post-mortem to decide whether you
can be present.  You will have to speak to the pathologist
about that".
<P>

 
<P>

7   	Contact with the pathologist who is to perform the
post-mortem examination, Dr Neil Langlois, reveals that he did not assent
to
the presence of Mr Hughes.  For completeness I should add that Miss Stevenson
is also alleged to have said to Mr Hughes that only
a forensic pathologist can
be present as an observer.  That statement would appear to exclude the presence
of registered general
medical practitioners or, indeed, medical practitioners
of any speciality with the exception of that mentioned.  It is asserted by
Mr
Hughes that there are few forensic pathologists in practice in this state
outside of those in government service. 
<P>

8   	Against that background I turn to the motion by the
defendant. The first proposition is that nomination of the State Coroner
of New
South Wales does not bring before this court the correct defendant.  If anybody
is amenable to jurisdiction it was submitted
that it is the deputy state
coroner, Miss Stevenson, in her personal capacity.  Reference was made to her
direction that the post-mortem
take place pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca120/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48</a> of the<b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca120/" class="autolink_findacts">Coroners
Act</a></b> and that pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca120/s24.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 24</a> of that statute the possession and control of
the body of the deceased lay in her.  In addition it was asserted, although
there is
presently no evidence of this before the court, that Dr Langlois who
is to perform the post-mortem examination is the employee of
the Western Sydney
Area Health Service and  neither is that service a defendant.
<P>

9   	I am unpersuaded that the matter should turn upon the
specific nomination of the State Coroner as defendant.  If there is substance
in the matters adverted to by counsel for the plaintiff the circumstances are
such that it would appear to me an appropriate case
for consideration of
necessary substitution.  I do not regard it as necessary to explore the matter
of parties further.
<P>

10   	The second argument of the defendant however adverts to
the absence of any specific power for this court to make the orders
sought.
There is one reference in the<b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca120/" class="autolink_findacts">Coroners Act</a></b> to an entitlement to be
present at post-mortem and that is in the case where there is potential for
allegation against a medical
practitioner and there is specific provision for
that medical  practitioner to be present to observe the post-mortem.  The
powers
of the court specified in the Act are set out in s48A.   In effect, the
court can order that no post-mortem examination at all take
place or that a
partial post-mortem examination take place.
<P>

11   	It was suggested that perhaps as an adjunct power to
ordering a partial post-mortem examination it may be conceivable that
the court
could order the presence of particular persons in order to see and ensure that
the precise terms of such an order were
carried out.  The present case is not
one in which partial post-mortem examination is being ordered by the court.  As
I indicated
in passing the basis upon which the plaintiff essentially seeks to
attract the jurisdiction of this court is found in its administrative
review
power.
<P>

12   	Reference was made to<b> Abernethy v Deitz</b> 39NSWLR
701. That was a case which concerned direction by this court in connection with
a coroner's discretionary power to order
the carrying out of a post-mortem.
The decision in that case was followed by specific legislation now being s48A
of the Act to which
I have made reference.  The extent of potential
administrative review is conveniently set out in some remarks of Mahoney P in
<b>Abernethy</b>.  His Honour said this:
<P>

"Steps taken in the ordinary course of the conduct of a department or other
purely ministerial steps not amounting to an act in
the law performed in the
exercise of a specific legal power may perhaps provide instances of this kind
(the kind being those not
subject to administrative review).  But a direction
given pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca120/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s48</a> (of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca120/" class="autolink_findacts">Coroners Act</a>) is not of this kind.  It is a
direct exercise of a statutory authority and is subject to review
accordingly.
<P>

 
<P>

Such a review is, of its nature, not a review of the merits of the exercise of
the power.  Judicial review of this kind is limited
essentially to the validity
of the act done.
<P>

 
<P>

The grounds upon which the court will, on such a review, set aside such an act
are well recognised.  They include, inter alia, cases
in which the power has
been exercised for a purpose not within the scope of the power; where, in
exercising the power, regard has
been had to considerations which are not
within the scope of the power or there has been a failure to have regard to
considerations
which are within the scope of the power; and where the exercise
of the power is, within the<b> Wednesbury</b> principle, so unreasonable as not
to be an exercise of the power. "
<P>

13   	It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the
failure of Miss Stevenson to make a decision herself as to whether Mr
Hughes
could attend and take photographs of the post-mortem but rather her apparent
delegation of decision to the forensic pathologist
conducting the post-mortem
examination was a failure which was reviewable in accordance with the
principles to which I have made
reference.  I do not accept that submission.
<P>

14   	The statutory authority of Miss Stevenson was to direct
that the post-mortem examination take place.  The  administrative
details as to
the conduct of it are things which are not the direct exercise of statutory
power but in my view administrative procedures
relating to the carrying out of
the particular task.
<P>

15   	It was vigorously submitted that the refusal of relief
would leave the relatives of deceased persons who were interested in
having
independent supervision of post-mortem examinations without any recourse
against the exercise of discretion by the particular
forensic pathologists.  If
it was thought desirable that some authority outside of the coroner should have
such a discretionary power
or merit review power then that is a matter in my
view for the Parliament.
<P>

16   	Reference was made to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca120/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 25</a> of the<b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca120/" class="autolink_findacts">Coroners Act</a></b> but
it seems to me that that section in its terms is the vesting of a power in a
coroner to enable entry into places for the purposes
of discharge of the
coroner's duty and is entirely removed from the circumstances now under
consideration.
<P>

17   	Finally, I should note that it was submitted that the
failure to make a decision by Miss Stevenson could be categorised as
unreasonable within the <b>Wednesbury </b>principle. It suffices to record that
I reject that submission.
<P>

18   	It should be noted again that the proceedings have reached
the stage only of having the evidence on behalf of the plaintiff
read and no
cross-examination has yet taken place.  It was foreshadowed that in the event
that the current ore tenus motion failed
the defendant would desire to place
some evidence before the court.  It should be observed  that counsel for the
plaintiff indicated
that he had not seen in draft or otherwise any such
evidence and therefore was not in a position to know what explanation, if any,
was being offered for the decisions made or not made, as the case may be.  I
refer to this merely to place it upon the record.
<P>

19   	I am of the opinion that, leaving to one side the issue of
the correct specification of the defendant the relief sought should
not be made
available even if the material in Mr Hughes affidavit is given full weight.  It
should also be mentioned that the funeral
arrangements for the late Mr Smith
are such that it is anticipated that the burial or cremation, as the case may
be, will take place
tomorrow.
<P>

20   	Necessarily a matter such as this must be dealt with as a
matter of urgency.  For that reason I would in general not regard
technical
matters as of any great weight as an obstacle to the granting of relief but the
conclusion that I have reached is that
the further hearing of this matter would
be futile.  I add to the foregoing that nothing was put forward to suggest that
in performance
of the post-mortem, Dr Langlois might do anything or form any
opinion contrary to the interests of the Smith family and the description
"independent" sought to be attached to Mr Hughes should not be thought to
convey any implication that Dr Langlois would discharge
his duty other than
professionally and objectively. Accordingly, I order that the summons be
dismissed and the plaintiff to pay the
defendant's costs.
