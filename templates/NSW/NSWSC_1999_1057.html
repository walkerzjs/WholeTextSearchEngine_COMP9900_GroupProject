<b>JUDGMENT (Absolute privilege - statements to ALP Caucus - statements outside
Parliament - adoption of speech in Parliament - tendering
Hansard "<i>as a
matter of history</i>" - application for permanent stay)</b>
<P>

1   	The Amended Statement of Claim filed on 20 March 1998
pleads that the plaintiff is the Secretary of the New South Wales Branch
of the
Australian Labor Party (the plaintiff is now a Member of Parliament).
<P>

2   	It is further pleaded that the defendant is a Member of the
Legislative Council of this State (she now no longer is).
<P>

3   	Paragraph 3 pleads that on 17 September 1997 the defendant
said the words set forth in Schedule A to the pleading during a
session of the
Legislative Council.  The Schedule is presumably a reproduction of a speech
recorded in Hansard.
<P>

4   	By paragraph 4 of the Amended Statement of Claim the
plaintiff asserts that the speech or the "<i>substance thereof</i>" was widely
reported in newspapers and on radio and television and thus came to the
"<i>attention of readers ... throughout the State of New South Wales</i>".
Particulars are then given of publications in various newspapers.
<P>

5   	It is in paragraph 5 that the plaintiff pleads <b>the first
publication</b> of which he complains alleging that on 18 September 1997 the
defendant published of and concerning him the following words to a Special
Meeting of the NSW Parliamentary Labor Party ("<i>Caucus"</i>):
<P>

<i>"I stand by the comments that I made over this matter and I believe that
there has been a massive cover up to protect certain paedophiles
organised
through the Wood Royal Commission involving meetings with various
parties".</i>
<P>

6   	Paragraph 6 pleads that the defendant in publishing the
matter on 18 September 1997 to "<i>Caucus</i>" knew and intended that her words
or their substance would be republished and that such republication was the
natural and probable
consequence of the original publication (to the
"<i>Caucus")</i>.  The <i>said words </i>were republished and the defendant, it
is alleged, is liable for each such republication.  Particulars are provided of
three newspaper
articles.  This is the <b>second (re)-publication</b> relied
upon. 
<P>

7   	Paragraph 7 pleads the <b>third publication </b>of which he
complains namely, that on 13 October 1997 the defendant published of and
concerning the plaintiff the words ascribed to
her in the course of an
interview broadcast by the ABC.  The words are as follows:
<P>

<i>"Defendant:	I will just say this.  I will just say this.  That I am
preparing a statement with all supporting documents, statutory
declarations,
information I have received, very sensitive material to be tabled in Parliament
and for all members of Parliament to
see the material.</i>
<P>

<i>Clark:	Will that material support the allegations that you have made?</i>
<P>

<i>Defendant:	Well, it's exactly what I intend to do.  I am prepared to back up
what I said in Parliament.  I have always acted with
honesty and integrity in
the interest of the children and with information I was given.  I have checked
the information.  I am not
a policeman or a detective.  I have to the best of
my knowledge checked the information and the people who have given it to
me".</i>
<P>

8   	The <b>fourth</b> publication of which the plaintiff
complains is alleged to have taken place on 10 November 1997 during an
interview broadcast by
the ABC in the course of the "<i>Four Corners</i>"
program, reliance being placed upon the words attributed to the defendant.  The
text is as follows:
<P>

<i>"Interviewer:	Bob Carr and Peter Collins were schedule </i>(sic) <i>to meet
but the meeting was cancelled so you're clearly wrong on that score.  Are you
sorry that you implied that Peter Collins met
with Bob Carr and had this
discussion?</i>
<P>

<i>Defendant:	Now I, I, stand by the statement I made in my speech in
Parliament and ah, as I said, I'll ask the community to judge me.</i>
<P>

<i>Interviewer:	But Peter Collins never did meet Bob Carr.</i>
<P>

<i>Defendant:	There is definitely a letter from the Premier inviting Peter
Collins and from Peter Collins saying to the premier, yes,
I'm definitely going
to meet you.  I mean the letters are there.  I haven't invented them.  I've got
a copy and I will be very happy
to show them to you.  So what happened then?
Did the heat become too great and they decided to cancel it?</i>
<P>

<i>Interviewer:	Maybe they just cancelled the meeting Franca?  Haven't you,
haven't you ever cancelled an appointment with um ...</i>
<P>

<i>Defendant:	Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>Interviewer:	... with anyone I mean maybe that's just what happened isn't
it?</i>
<P>

<i>Defendant:	Yeh well maybe, maybe.</i>
<P>

<i>Interviewer:	Franca there's not been one shred of evidence supporting your
allegations in Parliament about a high level cover up of
paedophiles, you've
virtually lost all your credibility on that allegation haven't you?</i>
<P>

<i>Defendant:	Well I just want to ask people this question.  If there was a
cover up do you think the people who did it would admit to
it?  That's all I'm
going to say".</i>
<P>

9   	The <b>fifth publication </b>of which Mr Della Bosca
complains is alleged to have taken place (in paragraph 9) on 13 November 1997
during the course of an interview
on ABC radio.  The publication complained of
is in the following terms:
<P>

<i>"Clark:	Will you appear before the Privileges Committee and will you
substantiate your allegations?</i>
<P>

<i>Defendant:	Absolutely".</i>
<P>

10   	In paragraph 10 of the Amended Statement of Claim in
respect of the publications complained of the plaintiff pleads that each
in its
natural and ordinary meaning conveyed the following imputations defamatory of
him (the causes of action):
<P>

<i>"10(a) the plaintiff had participated in a conspiracy to conceal the
criminal activities of highly placed paedophiles and perverts;</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	the plaintiff had deliberately prevented people who had committed
disgusting sexual crimes against children from being brought
to justice;</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	the defendant's allegations that the plaintiff had participated in a
cover-up of the criminal activities of paedophiles were true
and based on
reliable information which she had checked;</i>
<P>

<i>(d)	the plaintiff participated in the suppression of the proper
investigation of the criminal activities of high profile paedophiles
and the
public exposure of such people;</i>
<P>

<i>(e)	the plaintiff attempted to suppress the proper investigation of the
criminal activities of high profile paedophiles and the public
exposure of such
people."</i>
<P>

11   	(I note, though it is not critical for present purposes,
that the plaintiff concedes that imputation 10(c) is amenable to
re-drafting as
a matter of form.)
<P>

12   	Paragraph 11 of the Amended Statement of Claim is in the
following terms:
<P>

<i>"To the extent that the facts stated in paragraphs 3 and 4 above did not
form part of the general knowledge of the community the matters
respectively
complained of in paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 above conveyed the defamatory
imputations pleaded in paragraph 10 above
as true innuendoes to those persons
who knew the said facts".</i>
<P>

13   	By a Notice of Motion the defendant (who has cross-claimed
against John Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty Limited, Nationwide News Pty
Limited and
the Australian Broadcasting Corporation) seeks the following orders:
<P>

<i>"1.	Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Amended Statement of Claim be struck out on
the basis that matters published in meetings of the parliamentary
caucus of the
Labor Party are protected by absolute privilege.</i>
<P>

<i>2.	The whole of these proceedings be perpetually stayed on the basis that
the causes of action jointly or severally canvass Hansard.</i>
<P>

<i>3.	Further or in the alternative the plaintiff be directed to file a Further
Amended Statement of Claim pleading each publication
(and the imputations and
innuendos arising therefrom) separately".</i>
<P>

14   	The following observations can be made:
<P>

(a)	the plaintiff does <cite>not</cite> complain of the publication constituted
by the defendant's speech to the Legislative Council, that is, he does not sue
her for what
she <cite>there</cite><i> </i>said by reason of any defamatory
imputations thereby carried.
<P>

(b)	in respect of the publications complained of, the plaintiff pleads his
causes of action (the imputations) arising from the natural
and ordinary
meaning by reason of the facts stated in paragraphs 3 and 4 being within the
community's general knowledge.  The "<i>facts</i>" referred to are tolerably
clear from the paragraphs.  The plaintiff does not (and cannot) rely on
knowledge merely of the fact that
the speech was made.  What must be shown to
be within "<i>the general knowledge of the community</i>" was the content or
substance of what the defendant said.  The newspaper articles particularised,
by themselves, do not prove "<i>general knowledge in the community"</i>.  For
this purpose they may show a mechanism by which the community knowledge was
gained.  It is the content and substance of the
speech itself which must be
within the general community knowledge;
<P>

(c)	the plaintiff relies upon the facts set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 as
<i>"extrinsic facts</i>" founding the imputations as true innuendos (or
secondary or extended meanings).  The plaintiff is required by SCR Pt 67 r
12(c)
to provide particulars of the facts and matter on which he relies to
establish the defamatory meanings other than natural and ordinary
meanings.  In
this regard there has not been strict compliance with the rules of Court (see
order 3 sought in the Notice of Motion).
 On the assumption that the plaintiff
relies upon knowledge in the recipients of the "<i>extrinsic facts</i>" made up
by the words used in the speech, the rule has not been complied with.  Further,
the particularisation of the newspaper reports
in paragraph 4 is insufficient
for this purpose (<b><i>Stewart v Shoalhaven &amp; Nowra News Pty Limited
</i></b> (Hunt J, unreported, 26 September 1980);  <b><i>Hughes v Mirror
Newspapers Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%203%20NSWLR%20504" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1985) 3 NSWLR 504</a>;  see also <b><i>Consolidated
Trust v Browne</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWStRp/1948/71.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1948] NSWStRp 71</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281948%29%2049%20SR%20%28NSW%29%2086" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1948) 49 SR (NSW) 86</a> at 89).  Insofar as the plaintiff
has sought to comply in some way with the rule, he has by paragraph 3 of the
Amended Statement
of Claim pleaded the relevant particular as a material fact a
course proscribed by authority:  <b><i>Turner v Bulletin Newspaper Co Pty
Limited </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1974/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1974] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%20131%20CLR%2069" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) 131 CLR 69</a> at 80;  <b><i>Dawson Bloodstock Agency Pty
Limited v Mirror Newspapers Limited </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%202%20NSWLR%20733" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 2 NSWLR 733</a> at 736.
<P>

(d)	In none of the publications complained of is the plaintiff named; (he is
named in the speech).  The matters referred to in paragraphs
3 and 4 are
therefore relied upon for the purposes of "<i>identification", </i>that is,
matters are alleged/particularised which by reason of their being known to
listeners and viewers enables them to understand
the publications to be "<i>of
and concerning</i>" the plaintiff.  Under the heading "<i>Particulars of
Identification</i>" the plaintiff "<i>repeats paragraph 3 and 4 above".</i>
The press reports referred to in paragraph 4 are not before me on the present
application and I do not therefore know if the plaintiff
was named otherwise
than in the defendant's speech to the Legislative Council and if so, by whom
and when in relation to the publications
complained of (<b><i>Steele v Mirror
Newspapers </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%202%20NSWLR%20348" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974) 2 NSWLR 348</a>;  <b><i>Astaire v Campling </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281966%29%201%20WLR%2034" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1966)
1 WLR 34</a>;  <b><i>Van Ingen v Mail &amp; Express Publishing Co </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281898%29%2050%20NE%20879" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1898) 50
NE Rep 879</a>;  <b><i>Ware v Associated Newspapers Limited </i></b>(1969) 90 WN
(Pt 1) (NSW) 180 at 184;  <b><i>Grapelli v Derek Block (Holdings) Limited
</i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%201%20WLR%20822" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 1 WLR 822</a>;  <b><i>Haywood v Thompson </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281981%29%203%20WLR%20470" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1981) 3 WLR 470).</a>
For present purposes it is sufficient to observe that the particulars of that
identification should be clarified to expose the case
the plaintiff proposes to
prove on this issue.
<P>

(e)	it is clear that each of the publications complained of makes reference to
the defendants speech of the Legislative Council.
The publication pleaded in
paragraph 5 (to Caucus), however on its face contains the additional statement
"<i>... I believe ... various parties".</i>
<P>

(f)	the plaintiff claims aggravated terms on the basis that his hurt was
increased by his knowledge of:  (i)  the falsity of the
imputations; that
raises an "<i>issue</i>" in the proceedings (<b><i>Tabe v Amalgamated
Television Services Pty Ltd </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20A%20Def%20R%2050" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) A Def R 50</a>,025).  A further basis
for this claim is (ii) the defendant's motive - she knew the allegations were
false.  The plaintiff relies
on the "<i>findings of the Nader Royal Commission
and the defendant's refusal to give evidence before it".</i>
<P>

15   	What must be set aside at once is the defendant's
misconception of the structure of the plaintiff's action to the effect that
it
is seen to be one in which the plaintiff is suing the defendant for what she
said in her speech to the Legislative Council.  On
no reading of the pleading
is this construction available.
<P>

16   	Next, in relation to the statements to Caucus there is the
discrete question (leaving aside questions of adoption of what
was said in the
Legislative Council) of whether that publication is one protected by absolute
privilege.
<P>

17   	The defendant's position otherwise is that the plaintiff
can only sue on statements made outside Parliament.  In the circumstances
of
this litigation to establish an actionable case the plaintiff must prove;  (a)
publication (by adoption of otherwise);  (b) the
imputations as natural and
ordinary meanings or true innuendos (the causes of action in the strict sense);
(c) identification;  (d)
aggravated damages.
<P>

18   	None of these matters can the plaintiff establish without
tendering Hansard, it is submitted and thereafter and thereby calling
into
question in a proscribed way what the defendant said in Parliament. 
<P>

19   	As I understand it it is not disputed by the defendant
that a plaintiff can sue a member of Parliament in respect of publications
outside the legislature (<b><i>R v Lord Abingdon </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281793%29%201%20ESP%20226" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1793) 1 ESP 226</a> [170
ER 330];  <b><i>Beitzel v Crabb </i></b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1992/57.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1992] VicRp 57</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1992%5d%202%20VR%20121" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1992] 2 VR 121</a> at 126-127).
<P>

20   	It is argued, as I understand it, essentially that the
steps to be taken by the plaintiff purportedly in pursuit of the defendant
for
what she said outside of Parliament will ultimately and inevitably contravene
Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689.  In <b><i>Prebble v Television New
Zealand Limited </i></b>[1995] 1 AC 321 at 337A the Privy Council in its Advice
said:  "<i>... parties to litigation by whomsoever commenced, cannot bring into
question anything said or done in the House by suggesting (whether
by direct
evidence, cross-examination, inference or submission) that the actions or words
were inspired by improper motives or were
untrue or misleading".  </i>Thus it
is argued that even if the "<i>threshold</i>" difficulty is overcome by the
plaintiff, namely the proof of the publication of something said outside of
Parliament whether by
adoption or otherwise, the proposed action as structured
will of necessity infringe that statement of principle.  The more so it
is
submitted given their Lordships view in <b><i>Prebble</i></b> as to the
correctness of such decisions as <b><i>R v Murphy</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%205%20NSWLR%2018" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 5 NSWLR 18
(David</a> Hunt J) and <b><i>Wright v Advertiser Newspapers Limited v Lewis</i></b>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2053%20SASR%20416" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 53 SASR 416.</a>  What will be involved for the plaintiff goes further than
what hitherto has been generally accepted as the proper use of the reports
of
Parliament (that is, Hansard) to prove, for example, material facts so long as
there is no question of impeaching the proceedings:
 <b><i>NSW Branch of the
Australian Medical Association v Minister for Health &amp; Community Services
</i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2026%20NSWLR%20114" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1992) 26 NSWLR 114.</a>  In this regard it is interesting however to note
that in written submissions in this context the defendant asserts that an
"<i>obvious example would be that all that Hansard was tendered for was to
identify the plaintiff;  <b>Hyams v Peterson </b></i> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%203%20NZLR%20648" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1991) 3 NZLR 648".</a><i>
</i>The acceptable use of evidence of the proceedings of Parliament includes
proving that a government decision was announced in Parliament
on a particular
day and to establish that a Member of Parliament was present in the House and
voted on a particular day (<b><i>Uren v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty
Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%202%20NSWLR%20287" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) 2 NSWLR 287</a> at 289E);  to establish that a report of
Parliamentary reports corresponded with a debate itself and was fair and
accurate and therefore
attracted such defences as qualified privilege:
<b><i>Mundey v Askin</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281982%29%202%20NSWLR%20369F" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1982) 2 NSWLR 369F.</a>
<P>

21   	Ever bearing in mind any requirement to prove what was
said outside of Parliament, it is argued for the defendant that even
if it
cannot be considered that <b><i>Murphy</i></b> is either at odds at with all
English and overseas decisions and Australian authority, or if it is to be
applied, it still favours
the defendant.  This is so because in the peculiar
circumstances of this litigation and by reason of its structure at some point
(if not at all the points which I have identified), Hansard could only be used
to expose the defendant to civil liability arising
from the speech which it
records.
<P>

22   	Ms Gibson's submissions in this regard accord with recent
academic analysis.  In a paper entitled, "<i>The Courts, Parliamentary
Privilege and the Media</i>" <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UTSLawRw/1999/12.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1999] UTSLawRw 12</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1%20UTS%20Law%20Review%2082" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1 <u>UTS Law Review</u> 82</a> - August 1999)
Professor Sally Walker, in a paper which is of great utility in its coverage of
this field generally, states (at 92-93):
<P>

<i>"It is the Privy Council's attitude to <b>R v Murphy</b> which reveals a
major difference of approach regarding the scope of parliamentary privilege.
It is, however, suggested that regardless
of whether Hunt J is right that the
object of Article 9 is to ensure that a Member of Parliament cannot be liable
for what he or
she said in Parliament, or the Privy Council is right that the
aim is to ensure that members can speak freely without fear that what
they said
will later be held against them, the test established by Hunt J in <b>R v
Murphy</b> is correct.  That is, that parliamentary privilege operates to
prevent the questioning of statements made in Parliament only where
it can be
said that the Court proceedings seek to assert legal consequences against the
maker of the statement for making that statement.
 It is only where this test
is satisfied that it can be said that the Member would have any fear that what
he or she has said will
be held against the member.</i>
<P>

<i>There is a qualitative difference between, on the one hand, a case in which
what was said in parliamentary proceedings is the subject
of litigation and, on
the other, a case in which a statement made in Parliament is put into evidence
in proceedings which are directed
at material which is not part of proceedings
in Parliament.  If a Member of Parliament thought that defamation proceedings
could
be brought against them in respect of what they said in Parliament, of
course this might affect their willingness to speak freely
in the House.</i>
<P>

<i>This should however, be contrasted to the position where all that happens is
that evidence of parliamentary proceedings is put into
evidence in the course
of defamation proceedings brought by the Member of Parliament.  The decision to
commence proceedings lies
in the hands of the Member of Parliament.  The Member
of Parliament knows that no consequences will follow so far as he or she is
concerned from anything said in the House unless he or she chooses to institute
proceedings.</i>
<P>

<i>Indeed, the same could be said of those cases where a Member of Parliament
reaffirms, outside the House, usually in a media interview,
what he or she has
said inside the House and someone sues the Member of Parliament in respect of
what he or she said outside the
House.  Admitting evidence of what was said  in
the House in these circumstances could not be said to detract from the Member's
capacity
to speak freely in the House.  Evidence of what was said in the House
would be admitted, in this case, only where the Member of Parliament
has taken
the step of affirming what he or she said in the House, outside the
House".</i>
<P>

23   	The submissions for the defendant in writing were well
articulated and thorough.  As to the discrete point relating to absolute
privilege attending Caucus:  the difficulty confronting the defendant is the
"<i>strike out</i>" nature of her application and that whilst the Rules of the
Parliamentary Labour Party are before me, there is no evidence as to
its
"<i>business</i>" on the occasion by itself or vis-a-vis the business of the
Legislative Council.  In this context I am of the view that the relief
sought
in relation to this publication should not be granted.  Further, the law
provides no binding authority in this area.  In <b><i>Rata v The
Attorney-General </i></b>(unreported, 24 October 1996) Master J C A Thompson of
the High Court of New Zealand appears to have held in the circumstances where
the Master seems to have had evidence on the issue, that the Caucus as it had
developed in New Zealand is an integral part of the
Parliamentary process and
that all matters transacted in Caucus are inexplicably (sic - query
"<i>inextricably"</i>) linked to Parliament and thus attracts the privilege (at
19).  In <b><i>Holding v Jennings</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1979/29.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1979] VicRp 29</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%20VR%20289" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1979) VR 289</a> Anderson J held that
the publication of a privileged statement to a person for the purpose of
typing, printing and compiling such
statement is in accordance with the
reasonable and usual course of business of the Parliament and thus has the same
protection of
privilege as the publication of the statement on an occasion
attracting absolute privilege.  In <b><i>Roman Corp Limited v Hudson Bay Oil
&amp; Gas Co Limited</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%2036%20DLR%20%283d%29%20413" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) 36 DLR (3d) 413</a> the Supreme Court of Canada
implicitly upheld the decision of a the Court of Appeal of Ontario  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%2023%20DLR%20%283d%29%20292" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1972) 23
DLR (3d) 292</a> to the effect that a press release by then Canadian Prime Minister
was properly characterised as "<i>proceedings in Parliament</i>".  The Supreme
Court of South Australia in <b><i>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v
Chatterton </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%2046%20SASR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986) 46 SASR 1</a> effectively left the question open.
<P>

24   	It must therefore be said that the question of whether or
not proceedings of "<i>Caucus</i>" are embraced by the doctrine of absolute
privilege in relation to the proceedings of Parliament is clearly an arguable
one (see
also <b><i>O'Chee v Rowley</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20150%20ALR%20119" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 150 ALR 119</a> - Supreme Court
of Queensland).
<P>

25   	The submissions for the plaintiff are clear.  All that the
plaintiff intends to do, it is said, at trial is to prove what
the defendant
said "<i>as a matter of history"</i>.  There is no dispute on the authorities
that Article 9 of the Bill of Rights permits that course (see
<b><i>Uren</i></b> <i>(supra)</i>;  <b><i>Murphy </i></b><i>(supra);  <b>R v
Jackson &amp; Ors</b> </i>(1987) 18 SWLR 116;  <b><i>Beitzel</i></b><i>
(supra)</i>; <b><i> Laurance v Katter</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/qld/QCA/1996/471.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] QCA 471</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20141%20ALR%20447" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 141 ALR 447).</a>
<P>

26   	It is fundamental to the plaintiff's action that the
plaintiff does not seek to prove the falsity of the what the defendant
said in
Parliament.  The plaintiff relies on the falsity of the imputations as a matter
of aggravating damages but that does not
involve proof the falsity of the
defendant's statement in Parliament.  It involves proof of the falsity of the
imputations made by
the defendant "<i>outside Parliament". </i> They may be to
the same effect but that is irrelevant as is, it is submitted, the proof of the
Parliamentary statement to establish
the relevant extrinsic facts and the
identification of the plaintiff.  
<P>

27   	All that the plaintiff, as I have said, intends to do at
trial is to prove what the defendant said as a matter of history.
 The
plaintiff relies upon the passage I have already cited from
<b><i>Prebble</i></b> and what the Privy Council further said to the effect
that there can be no objection to the use of Hansard to prove what was done
and
said in Parliament <i>"as a matter of history"</i>.  
<P>

28   	That that is what the plaintiff seeks to do and is free to
do is supported by, for example, what Davies JA said in <b><i>Lawrence v
Katter</i></b> at 490:  "<i>no impropriety is alleged against the first
defendant in respect of what he said in Parliament.  What is alleged against
him in the
Statement of Claim is that what he said outside Parliament was false
and defamatory of the plaintiff.  It is true that proof of what
the first
defendant said outside Parliament was false will also prove that what he said
inside Parliament was false.  That is because
he incorporated the latter in his
statements outside Parliament.  The privilege of Article 9 applies to the
statements in Parliament
and not to the statements made out of Parliament even
though they incorporate by reference the statements made in Parliament".</i>
<P>

29   	It is thus the plaintiff's position that what he proposes
to do is no more than that which is allowable by authority.  In
a nutshell, as
a "<i>matter of history"</i> he will rely upon Hansard.  It is arguable clearly
on the authorities that the plaintiff is entitled so to do.  In <b><i>Prebble
</i></b>at 337 the Privy Council stated "<i>it will be for the trial judge to
ensure that the proof of these historical facts is not used to suggest that the
words were improperly
spoken ..."</i> (337F).
<P>

30   	As I have already said the question as to the application
of the immunity of absolute privilege to the publication to Caucus
is an
arguable one .  This precludes the making of order 1 in the Notice of
Motion.
<P>

31   	As to order 2 seeking a stay on the basis that the causes
of action jointly or severally "<i>canvass Hansard"</i>, whilst the defendant
has pointed to the several areas where this could happen, whether or not it
will is best determined at trial
and that will depend upon the mechanism of the
presentation of the plaintiff's case.  Whilst I am prepared to express the view
now
that the pleading of the plaintiff's case points to areas of peril I am not
persuaded to stay the proceedings at this point.  The
structure of the
plaintiff's case is complex and arguably quite artificial:  that is no reason
for precluding the plaintiff (subject
to obvious amendments to the pleading in
the technical sense) from seeking to prosecute and prove his causes of action.
I am not
persuaded that it is unarguable that the plaintiff's action as
structured will "<i>canvass Hansard"</i>.  Thus I do not propose to make order
2 in the Notice of Motion.  In each of the areas in respect of which the
defendant asserts
that the plaintiff "<i>will</i>" canvass Hansard, I see merit
in the submissions but I am not persuaded that at this stage of the proceedings
especially given their
idiosyncratic structure that it is appropriate to bring
them to an end in the way the defendant seeks.
<P>

32   	The plaintiff however will have to further amend his
Statement of Claim.  It seems to me that paragraph 3 and indeed paragraph
4 in
their present form are embarrassing - they do not plead a publication upon
which the plaintiff sues the defendant.  Further,
the plaintiff will have to
formalise the particulars of identification and ensure compliance with SCR Pt
67 r 12(c).  The plaintiff
has acknowledged that imputation (c) presently
pleaded in paragraph 10 needs attention.
<P>

33   	As I have said the structure of the plaintiff's case as
presently pleaded is artificial to an extent.  For the sake at least
of clarity
the plaintiff is directed in respect of each publication upon which he in fact
sues separately to provide particulars
of identification, particulars pursuant
to SCR Pt 67 r 12(c) as well as separately to plead the imputations upon which
he relies.

<P>

34   	Thus it is that to that extent the defendant has succeeded
in respect of order 3.
<P>

35   	In view however of the failure of the defendant to succeed
in having the paragraphs 5 and 6 struck out and the matter stayed
and that that
was the principal component of the application, the plaintiff should have the
benefit of an order for costs.
<P>

36   	The formal orders are:
<P>

1.	Orders 1 and 2 in the Notice of Motion are refused.
<P>

2.	I make Order 3 in the Notice of Motion.  The plaintiff is to file a Further
Amended Statement of Claim within 14 days of today.
<P>

3.	The defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs save for the costs of the
plaintiff filing any Further Amended Statement of Claim.
<P>

4.	The matter is listed for further directions on 19 November 1999.
