<P>

<b>1769 of 1998	SUSAN LOUISE GILL -v-</b>
<P>

<b>			PERMANENT TRUSTEE COMPANY 					LIMITED</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  These are proceedings under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act
</i>1982</a>.
<P>

2	By summons filed on 20 March 1998, the plaintiff Susan Louise Gill claims an
order for provision for her maintenance, education
and advancement in life out
of the estate of her mother Winifred Betty Barker (to whom I shall refer as
"the deceased").
<P>

3	The deceased died on 22 October 1996, aged 75. She left a will dated 9 August
1996, probate whereof was on 10 March 1997 granted
to Carol Lilian Grey, the
defendant named in such will. Subsequently, that named executor appointed
Permanent Trustee Company Limited
as executor of the will of the deceased, that
company consenting to such appointment. In consequence, on 12 October 1998 an
order
in the present proceedings was made by consent, substituting Permanent
Trustee Company Limited as defendant in the place of Carol
Grey, who had been
named as defendant to the summons.
<P>

4	The plaintiff was born on 8 September 1954, and is presently aged 44. She was
the only child of the deceased. The plaintiff's
parents separated in 1972, when
the plaintiff was aged about 18. She subsequently attended the University of
New England and then
Macquarie University, obtaining degrees in Science and
Arts respectively. The plaintiff is qualified as a professional psychologist,
and has practised as such.
<P>

5	In 1976 the plaintiff married her first husband. Of that marriage was born
one child, Rahm Adamedes, on 9 January 1979. Subsequently
the plaintiff
separated from her first husband in 1984, and moved to Lismore. In 1986 the
plaintiff married her second husband, Steven
Edward Gill. Of that marriage was
born one child, Sehran Kalun Ralph Gill, born on 13 January 1986. 
<P>

6	Shortly after the death of the deceased the plaintiff's father died, on 19
December 1996.
<P>

7	The will of the deceased (which occupies some 55 pages) constitutes what has
been described as a discretionary trust, of which
the named executor (and
subsequently Permanent Trustee Company Limited) is the trustee. Various
persons, being the plaintiff, her
former husband Steven Edward Gill, her two
children Rahm Adamedes and Sehran Kalun Ralph Gill, her aunt Joan Freia Gray
(sister of
the deceased) are named as "Specified Beneficiaries" in the will.
Provision is also made in the will for a further category of persons
described
as "General Beneficiaries". The general effect of the will is to give to the
executor in its capacity as trustee an unfettered
discretion to effect
distributions of corpus and of income not only to one or more of the Specified
Beneficiaries but also to one
or more of the General Beneficiaries.
<P>

8	Pursuant to the discretion given by the will, the named executor has effected
certain distributions to the plaintiff and to each
of her sons. Those
distributions included payments of amounts totalling $27,500 to the plaintiff,
amounts totalling $11,860 to the
Plaintiff and  her former husband Steven Gill
conjointly, an amount of $6,000 (for the purchase of a motor vehicle) to her
son Rahm
and an amount of $2,882 (for the purchase of a motor bike) to her son
Sehran.
<P>

9	I have already referred to the fact that the plaintiff is a psychologist by
profession. For some time she practised as a psychologist
at Lismore, and also
conducted a counselling clinic there. On account of problems with her own
health, both physical and mental,
the plaintiff is no longer able to work
full-time. She has, however, in relatively recent times been able to work one
day a week.
Medical evidence tendered on her behalf suggests that it could be
another two years before the plaintiff is able to resume full-time
work in her
chosen field. 
<P>

10	The plaintiff and her two children reside in a rural property situate at and
known as Lot 39, Bonnydoon Drive, Uki (near Murwillumbah
in northern New South
Wales). That property consists of 73 hectares. The homestead is located some
two kilometres from the nearest
public road and access to that house is by way
of an unsealed driveway (which, according to the plaintiff, is impassable in
wet weather).
According to Francis Peter Smith, a registered valuer, the
present value of that property is $155,000.
<P>

11	In consequence of consent orders made in proceedings between the plaintiff
and her former husband Steven Gill in the Family Court
of Australia, that house
property (which is subject to a mortgage of about $63,000 to the Commonwealth
Bank) is to be sold, and the
net proceeds of sale are to be divided equally
between the plaintiff and her former husband. It is estimated by the plaintiff
that
after the discharge of the mortgage and the payments of costs, expenses
and commission associated with the sale, the net proceeds
of that sale will be
about $84,000, and that each of the plaintiff and her former husband will thus
receive about $42,000.
<P>

12	The assets of the estate of the deceased at the time of her death consisted
of a house property situate at known as 406 Percy
Street, Albury, a motor
vehicle, various chattels, and investments held in bank accounts and on
deposit, as well as shares. The value
of those assets as disclosed in the
inventory of property annexed to the probate is $604,592. The house property
has since been sold,
for a little over $140,000 (from which was deducted
agent's commission and legal costs and expenses). At the present time the
assets
of the estate consist of the following:
<P>

	Debenture with AGC (due 25 November 2000) - $47,500.
<P>

	Listed shares, present total value - $211,404.
<P>

	Chattels (stamps and coins) - $1,487.
<P>

	UPA Loan (Murray Vale complex) - $67,000
<P>

	Tietyens investments - $177,000
<P>

	Total - $504,391
<P>

13	However, it is appropriate here to refer to the significant asset described
as the Tietyens investments of $177,000. It would
appear that the deceased
during her lifetime deposited with Tietyens, a firm of solicitors in Albury
(where the deceased had resided
for many years), moneys totalling $197,000. It
was expected by her that those moneys would be lent to clients of that firm of
solicitors,
and that such loans would be secured by first mortgages. Whether or
not that happened is open to very considerable doubt. 
<P>

14	It would appear that the mortgage business conducted by that firm of
solicitors collapsed, and that deposits totalling $24 million
were thereby put
at risk. I gather that the partners in the firm of solicitors either already
are or soon are to become bankrupt.
The present defendant notified a claim to
Lawcover (the professional indemnity insurer of Tietyens) and to the Law
Society of New
South Wales (in respect to a claim upon the Fidelity Fund). At
the present time there is considerable uncertainty as to whether all
or any
part of the investments of the deceased with Tietyens will be recovered by the
estate.
<P>

15	The purpose of the loan to UPA (United Protestant Association) was to enable
Mrs Joan Gray, aunt of the plaintiff and sister
of the deceased, to acquire a
retirement unit at the UPA Village, Murray Vale, Lavington. Both the plaintiff
and her mother had a
very good relationship with Mrs Gray, who resided with the
plaintiff and her parents while the plaintiff was growing up. The named
executor, Mrs Carol Grey (who is no relation to Mrs Joan Gray: their surnames
are differently spelt) not merely advanced the loan
necessary for Mrs Joan Gray
to acquire the retirement unit, but also agreed that the estate would pay the
necessary outgoings on
that unit for the remainder of Mrs Gray's life. She is
presently 81 years of age (having been born on 17 August 1917). Mrs Gray
supports
the present claim of the plaintiff, although she is desirous that the
outgoings upon her accommodation should continue to be paid
from the estate.
The plaintiff is agreeable to that arrangement continuing. 
<P>

16	The plaintiff's elder son Rahm also supports the claim of his mother.
Although aware of his entitlement to do so, and although
advised to do so by
the legal representatives of his mother, Rahm has chosen not to seek
independent legal advice. However, he filed
an affidavit in the proceedings,
and also gave oral evidence. His attitude at the present time is that he wishes
to make no claim
against the estate, and that he fully supports the claim of
his mother. He did, however, say that, in the event that the estate were
able
to recover anything from the Tietyens investments, he might wish then to make a
claim against the estate. 
<P>

17	The plaintiff as a daughter of the deceased is an eligible person within
paragraph (b) of the definition of the definition of
that phrase contained in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s6.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 6(1)</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. As such she has the standing
to bring the present proceedings. 
<P>

18	It is unclear whether or not either or both of the two children of the
plaintiff is an eligible person in relation to the deceased.
Each of those
children is, of course, a grandchild of the deceased. But, in order to be such
an eligible person, within paragraph
(d) of the definition of that phrase, it
is necessary that each of those grandchildren also have been totally or partly
dependent
upon the deceased. In the absence of evidence concerning any such
dependency, I am not satisfied that either of those children is
an eligible
person.
<P>

19	At the present time the plaintiff's income consists essentially of a
Supporting Parent's Benefit of $250 a week. In addition,
the plaintiff
receives, irregularly, amounts of $25 a week from her former husband, for the
maintenance of her younger son Sehran.
She also receives an average of $20 a
week by way of royalties from a publication of which she is the author. 
<P>

20	The plaintiff gave evidence (in her affidavit of 26 June 1998) of her
expenses, which she stated to total about $650 a week.
She said that she could
not afford to pay for insurance on her residence or on her motor car. Neither
has she been able to meet the
totality of the costs thus far charged to her
either in respect to her proceedings in the Family Court or in respect to the
present
proceedings.
<P>

21	Apart from her interest in the former matrimonial home, the assets of the
plaintiff consists of an amount of about $10,000 held
in a Streamline account
with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia at Murwillumbah (which, essentially,
represents what remains from
the interim distribution which she has received
from her father's estate, the balance of that amount having been expended on
Mastercard
debts, legal costs of the present proceedings, renovations and
repairs to the house property, motor vehicle repairs, living expenses,
and a
short holiday to the Gold Coast), and a Hyundai Sonata motor car (formerly
belonging to the deceased and included as an asset
in the estate), having a
current market value of $6,000. 
<P>

22	The present liabilities of the plaintiff, apart from the costs of the
present proceedings, consists of:
<P>

	Unpaid legal fees (Family Court proceedings) - $7,000
<P>

	CBA Mastercard - $3,500
<P>

	Half share of unpaid municipal rates - $750
<P>

23	It has already been recorded that the plaintiff's father died some two
months after the death of the deceased. Under the terms
of the will of George
Ralph Barker, father of the plaintiff, the plaintiff is entitled to one-half of
the assets of his estate. Those
assets are shown in the inventory of property
as totalling $303,401. However, since some of the assets are located in Hong
Kong,
the administration of that estate has been protracted. Further, it would
appear that the plaintiff's father did not lodge tax returns
for a number of
years, and that, in consequence, the value of his estate will be reduced
because of unpaid tax. The evidence does
not disclose the amount of that unpaid
tax, nor does it disclose whether any penalties will also be imposed. There has
already been
an interim distribution from that estate to the plaintiff in an
amount of $52,379. Of that amount she actually received only about
$42,000 (or,
according to her, somewhat less), the difference having been deducted by her
former solicitors, on account of costs'
claimed by them. There appears to be
considerable uncertainty as to how much the plaintiff will ultimately receive
from her father's
estate. 
<P>

24	I have already recorded that the plaintiff's two children reside with her.
There was, however, a conflict of evidence between
the plaintiff and her former
husband Steven Gill, as to the periods during which their son Sehran (now aged
13) was in the physical
custody of each of the plaintiff and of her former
husband. Sehran (who, according to his mother, does not enjoy good health)
attends
Murwillumbah High School. The plaintiff's elder son Rahm (who is now
aged 20) is currently unemployed and is in receipt of unemployment
benefits.
Rahm, although residing with his mother, does not make any contribution towards
his board.
<P>

25	Although the plaintiff is named as a Specified Beneficiary in the will of
the deceased, the trustee is not obliged to appoint
any income or capital in
favour of the plaintiff. It was submitted on her behalf that her benefits under
the will are indeterminate
and possibly illusory. In this regard I was referred
to the decision of Young J in <i>Gregory v Hudson</i> (18 September 1997,
unreported). His Honour in that case was dealing with a testamentary provision
in the nature of a discretionary
trust, although in that case the testator had
provided a number of documents setting forth his wishes and desires concerning
the
benefits to be given by his trustee to various beneficiaries. His Honour
quoted with approval the following passage from Dickey on
<i>Family Provision
After Death</i> (LBC, Sydney, 1992), 121, 
<P>

	There is some authority for the proposition that where a person is in need of
provision but the quantum of provision made for him
or her from a deceased's
estate is wholly dependent upon the discretion of trustees, this provision is
not adequate. In all probability,
however, this is not an inflexible rule. In
all probability the question of whether provision of this kind is adequate
depends upon
the particular facts and circumstances of the case.
<P>

26	His Honour continued, 
<P>

	I consider, with respect, that Professor Dickey's comment is close to the
mark. Ordinarily a benefit provided under a discretionary
trust is a fairly
illusory benefit because it can be terminated without reason and there is
little likelihood of the discretionary
beneficiary being able to force the
trustee to pay her a benefit. [His Honour then proceeded to consider the effect
of the various
expressions of wishes provided by the testator to the
trustee]
<P>

27	In the instant case the position of the plaintiff is different from that
considered by Young J, where there was a memorandum
of wishes executed by the
testator and the trustees indicated that it was their intention to seek to
carry out faithfully those wishes,
which included a wish that the widow of the
deceased receive substantial provision from the trust. In the instant case the
defendant
trustee does not give any indication of what course it might take
concerning the future distributions from the trust. Indeed, it
might well not
be proper for it to do so in the present proceedings, since any such statement
at this time might be regarded as fettering
its discretion in the future.
<P>

28	Although some attempt was made on the part of the defendant to suggest that
the relationship between the plaintiff and the deceased
was not a close
daughter/mother relationship, I am quite satisfied that, having regard to the
fact that for most of her adult life
the plaintiff was living in northern New
South Wales, whilst the deceased was residing at Albury, in the far south of
the State,
the contact between the plaintiff and her mother was of a nature and
of a degree concerning which the deceased expressed no dissatisfaction.
It
appears that the deceased herself suffered from various emotional problems, and
that the plaintiff provided her with support and
counselling to assist her with
those problems.
<P>

29	The statements of the deceased to Mrs Carol Grey (set forth in her affidavit
of 9 February 1999, in particular, paragraph 16
thereof), clearly reveal that
the deceased wished to make substantial provision for the plaintiff. However,
the means which she chose,
by way of a discretionary trust, have not
necessarily had that result. 
<P>

30	It is obvious that at the present time the plaintiff has undoubted financial
and material need. Her pressing and essential need
is for security of
accommodation, since, in consequence of the orders made in the Family Court,
she must shortly vacate her present
residence.
<P>

31	Evidence was placed before the Court concerning the cost of various
residences in that part of northern New South Wales in which
the plaintiff
presently resides. Evidence of Robyn Cole (filed on behalf of the plaintiff)
showed that houses in the Byron Bay area
cost between $300,000 and $355,000.
The evidence of valuation provided on behalf of the defendant from D. V.
Cochrane &amp; Co suggested
a price range of between $150,000 and $250,000,
although Mr Cochrane's prices related to residences at Mullumbimby, rather than
at
Byron Bay. 
<P>

32	It is appropriate that the plaintiff should receive from the estate an
amount which will enable her to acquire alternative accommodation.
Assuming
that she receives a net amount of about $40,000 from the sale of her present
residence, and that that amount goes towards
the acquisition of another
residence for herself and her two sons, she should receive at least a further
$250,000 towards the acquisition
of such a further residence. In addition, the
plaintiff should receive a further amount which will enable her to discharge
her present
liabilities, and to provide a fund to meet contingencies. An
additional amount of $100,000 would, in my view, be appropriate for
that
purpose. That is, I consider that the plaintiff has established an entitlement
to receive out of the estate a legacy in the
sum $350,000. 
<P>

33	The entitlement to such a legacy must, however, be viewed in the light of
competing claims of any other eligible persons and
of any other beneficiaries
in the estate. It is possible that Mrs Joan Gray is an eligible person,
although the evidence is not entirely
clear in that regard. Although I am not
satisfied that either of Rahm and Sehran is an eligible person, nevertheless
each is also
a potential object of the testamentary beneficence of the
deceased, since each is a Specified Beneficiary named in the will. Mrs
Gray is
also a Specified Beneficiary, as also is Steven Gill, the former husband of the
plaintiff. It will be appreciated, however,
that Mr Gill was designated as such
at a time when he was still married to the plaintiff. 
<P>

34	I have already recorded that Mrs Joan Gray supports the claim of the
plaintiff, although she is desirous that the outgoings of
her retirement unit
should continue to be paid from the trust. Rahm also supports the claim of his
mother. Sehran is largely, almost
entirely, dependent upon his mother. 
<P>

35	A number of affidavits by Steven Gill have been filed on behalf of the
defendant. Those affidavits set forth information concerning
the financial and
material circumstances of Mr Gill, and concerning his health. Mr Gill has made
a claim upon the estate for repayment
of amounts totalling $14,698 (together
with charges and interest upon those amounts), in respect to travel expenses
charged to various
bank and credit card accounts by Mr Gill and the plaintiff
for overseas travel which, according to him, the original executor had
agreed
would be met by the estate. As I understand it, that claim, which is disputed
by the plaintiff, has not yet been admitted
by the defendant.
<P>

36	The attitude of Mr Gill to the plaintiff's claim appears to be that, since
he is a Specified Beneficiary named in the will of
the deceased, he should
remain a potential object of the discretionary distributions from the estate.
Any reduction in the assets
of the estate available to meet such distributions
would, of course, affect the amount available to be distributed among the
Specified
Beneficiaries.
<P>

37	But it should here be recognised that Steven Gill was designated a Specified
Beneficiary at a time when he was married to the
plaintiff  and that upon the
termination of that marriage the financial arrangements of Steven Gill in
relation to the plaintiff
have been determined by way of consent orders made by
the Family Court of Australia. It is inappropriate that the practical effect
of
those orders should now be altered, so as to preserve a possibility of Steven
Gill receiving a benefit from the estate of his
former mother-in-law, whilst
thereby limiting, or reducing,  the right of the plaintiff to obtain an order
for provision an entitlement
to which she has otherwise established in the
present proceedings. To permit any order for provision in the plaintiff's
favour to
be reduced, on account of the potential entitlement of her former
husband, undermines the resolution of their differences in the
Family Court
settlement.
<P>

38	In those circumstances, I do not consider that the entitlement of the
plaintiff to a legacy in the sum of $350,000 should, on
account of any
competing claims on the part of Mrs Joan Gray, Rahm, Sehran, or Steven Gill, be
reduced, let alone extinguished. 
<P>

39	I have to this point proceeded upon the basis that the assets of the estate
total $504,391. From those assets must be met the
costs of each party of the
present proceedings as well as the costs and administration expenses and
commission of the defendant.
However, the defendant has estimated that to the
value of the assets of $504,391 there should now be added cash in respect to
capital
of $80,492, and in respect of income of $9,037, making a gross total of
the value of the estate in the sum of $593,921. There are
outgoings estimated
to the end of May 1999 in a total sum of $34,376 to which must be added the
estimated costs of the proceedings
of each party (those of the plaintiff
estimated to total between $25,000 and $32,000, and those of the defendant
estimated to total
about $16,000)
<P>

40	It would be likely, therefore, that the value of the net distributable
estate would be of the order of the about $520,000. However,
it must be
appreciated that a component of that amount is the deposit with Tietyens of
$177,000, the recovery of which is uncertain.
Even if part or all of that
amount were able to be recovered, allowance must be made for the costs which
the estate would incur in
effecting that recovery.
<P>

41	For practical purposes, therefore, it seems to me that the Tietyens deposit
should be disregarded, and that the Court should
proceed upon the basis that
the value of the net distributable estate is no more than about $350,000. 
<P>

42	Further, of that amount of about $350,000 part is represented by a debenture
of $47,500 which does not become due until the latter
part of next year, and
part by an amount of $67,000 which will not become payable until the death of
Mrs Joan Gray. Thus there will
only be about $235,000 presently available to
meet any sum awarded to the plaintiff.
<P>

43	It seems to me, nevertheless, that the Court should order that the plaintiff
receive out of the estate of the deceased a legacy
in the sum of $350,000, but
that of that legacy, an amount of $47,500 should not be payable before 25
November 2000, and a further
amount of $67,000 should not be payable during the
lifetime of Mrs Joan Gray. Further, the amount of $47,500 should not bear
interest
until it becomes payable, and the amount of $67,000 should not bear
interest during the lifetime of Mrs Joan Gray, whilst the balance
of the legacy
should bear interest if not paid by a specified date.
<P>

44	I consider that the proposed legacy in favour of the plaintiff should be in
addition of the benefits given to her under the will
of the deceased. She has
already received some of those benefits, by way of distributions from the
trust. If the proposed legacy
were to be ordered to be in lieu of the benefits
given to her by the will, it might be possible for it to be suggested (since
the
legacy will have effect as if it were given in a codicil to the will
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/s14.html" class="autolink_findacts">(section 14</a> (1) of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/fpa1982209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>), and, in consequence, will
have effect from the date of the death of the deceased), that the benefits
already received by the plaintiff
from the estate of the deceased should be
repaid by her to the estate. Further, it seems to me that, to the extent that
there might
remain any assets in the estate --- in particular the possibility
that part or all of the Tietyens deposit might be recovered ---
the discretion
of the trustee to make distributions in accordance with the terms of the will,
including distributions to the plaintiff
herself, should remain unaffected.
<P>

45	Accordingly, I make the following orders:
<P>

1. 	I order that, in addition to the benefits given to her by the will of the
late Winifred Betty Barker ("the deceased"), the plaintiff
receive a legacy in
the sum of $350,000, (the sum of $47,500, being part of such legacy, not to be
payable before 25 November 2000,
and the sum of $67,000, being part of such
legacy, not to be payable during the lifetime of Joan Freia Gray), the sum of
$67,000,
being part of such legacy, not to bear interest during the lifetime of
Joan Freia Gray, and the balance of the said legacy not to
bear interest if
$235,500 is paid on or before 30 May 1999 and $47,500 is paid on or before 26
November 2000.
<P>

2. 	I order that the costs of the plaintiff on the party and party basis and
the costs of the defendant on the indemnity basis be
paid out of the estate of
the deceased.
<P>

3. 	The exhibits may be returned.
