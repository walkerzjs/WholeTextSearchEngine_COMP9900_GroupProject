<b>JUDGMENT (Corrs Chambers Westgarth subpoena)</b>
<P>

1	On 16 April 1999 the defendant's solicitors served a subpoena on the Managing
Partner of Corrs Chambers Westgarth (Corrs), Mr
Marsden's solicitors in
relation to the criminal investigation, calling for the production of the
following material:
<P>

	"<i>All documents (or copies thereof) provided or shown by Michael Lee, or any
assistant or agent acting on his behalf, to Detective Superintendent
Woodhouse
in the period from 25 November 1998 to date (inclusive) in relation to any
anticipated criminal proceedings concerning
MR JOHN ROBERT MARSDEN".</i>
<P>

2	The historical origin of the defendant's subpoena is non-contentious:
Detective Superintendent Woodhouse has given evidence in
the still to be
resolved Amendment Application to the effect that he had further meetings with
Mr Lee (of Corrs) solicitor for Mr
Marsden in March 1999.
<P>

3	Mr Pembroke S.C. appeared for Corrs Chambers Westgarth to move the Court for
orders precluding production to and inspection by
the defendant of documents
delivered to the Court by Mr Lee in answer to the subpoena.
<P>

4	I understand that a Notice to Produce in similar terms was served by the
solicitors for the defendant upon Messrs Phillips Fox,
solicitors for the Mr
Marsden in the defamation proceedings (T1377.35;  1381.2-28), hence Mr McHugh's
appearance for the plaintiff
in the defamation action in opposition to the
production and inspection of the documents.
<P>

5	Inspection is opposed upon grounds of legal professional privilege, common
interest privilege and public interest immunity.  Otherwise,
it is sought to
have me preclude inspection in the exercise of my discretion.
<P>

6	The evidence in support of the Corrs application is constituted by three
affidavits sworn by Michael Bryan Joshua Lee, two on
20 April 199 and the third
on 23 April 1999, and the oral evidence he gave.
<P>

7	Additionally, there was received into evidence three bundles of documents,
Exhibits A, B and C being the exhibits referred to
as "ML 1", "ML 2" and ML 3"
in paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 of the larger of the two affidavits sworn on 20 April
1999.
<P>

8	Exhibit A ("ML 1") is described in paragraph 6 of the affidavit as a
compendium of some of the documents shown by Mr Lee to Mr
Woodhouse at a
meeting on 8 March 1999.
<P>

9	Exhibit B ("ML 2") are said to being material "<i>believed by Mr Lee to have
been shown to Mr Woodhouse on 8 March 1999"</i>.
<P>

10	Exhibit C ("ML 3") is material in respect of which, in the affidavit
(paragraph 8), Mr Lee swears that, despite his best endeavours,
he does not
recollect showing to Mr Woodhouse.
<P>

11	It appears from the affidavits of 20 April and 23 April that there had been
an exchange of correspondence (annexures B and A
respectively), between Mr Lee
and Mr Woodhouse dated 14 and 15 October respectively, in which it was
certainly made clear by Mr Lee
that he was in the process of preparing a
compendium of documents to deal with, amongst other things, what were said to
be inherent
weaknesses and falsity of allegations made against Mr Marsden; the
motivation for fabricating allegations against Mr Marsden;  concerns
about
methodology used in the course of the investigations against Mr Marsden;  and
the impossibility of securing a conviction against
him.  Reference is made on
page 4 of annexure B to the desire to maintain client legal privilege in
relation to any material provided,
and to a willingness to disclose it on the
basis of their being a "<i>common interest</i>" in analysing the material.
<P>

12	In relation to Exhibit C, contrary to the submissions of Mr Wheelhouse, I am
unable to come to a conclusion that more probably
than not the material that
comprises that Exhibit was disclosed at all to Mr Woodhouse.  Its function was
to provide a "<i>prompt"</i> to Mr Lee.  The mere fact that it was a prompt
does not lead rationally to a conclusion that that which was "<i>prompted"</i>
by its existence was a revelation of its contents.  The contents whatever they
might be might have prompted to Mr Lee to make observations
in relation to
Exhibits A and B.  That does not amount to a disclosure, in my view, on the
evidence, of Exhibit C.  Exhibit C will
be excluded from consideration as
available for inspection on that basis.  
<P>

13	As to the material in Exhibits A and B relating to the person who does not
have a "D" number, the defendant has abandoned its
application for inspection
of documents in relation to that material.  For that reason, that material will
not be considered for
disclosure.
<P>

14	An interview took place involving Mr Woodhouse, Mr Lee and Mr Marsden on 29
January (as to which see my ruling on 19 March: 
NSWSC 212 and the decision of
the Court of Appeal:  NSWCA 97 of 15 April 1999). Mr Lee deposes to discussing
providing material to
Mr Woodhouse after that interview concerning matters that
he, Mr Lee, believed would need clarification and would be of assistance
to his
client in "<i>refuting</i>" allegations put to him during the interview.  Mr
Woodhouse wished to receive from Mr Lee any material Mr Lee believed relevant
to
the allegations discussed.  It was shortly after that interview that Mr Lee
became aware that the defendant in the defamation proceedings
had issued the
subpoena the subject of the setting aside application by the plaintiff (running
concurrently with the application
by the defendant to amend), seeking
production of material relating to the ongoing investigation of Mr Marsden by
Strike Force Cori.
 Mr Lee formed the view that any further material he
provided to Mr woodhouse might be the subject of a further subpoena by the
defendant's
solicitors and became concerned to ensure that the provision of any
further material occurred in a way which best preserved privilege
and
confidentiality.
<P>

15	This matter was raised with Mr Woodhouse in a telephone conversation in
early February particularly in regard to Mr Lee having
access to material which
would destroy the defendant's witnesses' credit and to his concern that by
giving it to Mr Woodhouse unconditionally
it would fall into the hands of
Channel 7.  Mr Lee subsequently spoke to Mr Singleton of the Crown Solicitors
to raise again the
dilemma which was encapsulated in the expression that he, Mr
Lee, did not wish to put his client in a position "<i>where Barker's
cross-examination is flagged in advance</i>".
<P>

16	On 25 February Mr Lee had a further conversation with Mr Woodhouse who
indicated his anxiety to bring the matter to a conclusion
and to finish his
report to the DPP.  As I understand the evidence it was arranged that Mr
Woodhouse would attend the office of Mr
Lee on 8 March at 11.00am.
<P>

17	Mr Lee attended the meeting with a large number of files and two folders of
documents containing copies of Police documents highlighted
and annotated by
him and other documents provided to him by Mr Marsden for the purpose of
providing a response to Mr Woodhouse in
relation to anticipated criminal
proceedings.  At the commencement of the meeting Mr Lee again expressed his
concern that the material
which he was to make available to Mr Woodhouse being
kept in the strictest confidence:  it would be very damaging for the conduct
of
the defamation proceedings if Channel 7 was to be <i>"tipped off</i>" as to
cross-examination.  Mr Lee invited Mr Woodhouse to look at the material to
finalise his report to the DPP.  Mr Woodhouse understood
the difficulty and
appreciated what Mr Lee had said to him.  There followed a discussion with Mr
Woodhouse in which Mr Lee made a
number of observations relating to the Police
material.  That process involved Mr Lee going through part of the Police
documents
and pointing out to Mr Woodhouse matters that Mr Lee considered
contained errors of fact, inconsistencies and improbabilities.  Mr
Woodhouse
was left to read the material. 
<P>

18	It was on 18 March that Mr Woodhouse telephoned Mr Lee again saying that he
was getting pretty close to finalising his report
and would like to come and
see Mr Lee and "<i>see some further material"</i>.  Upon inquiry Mr Lee
apparently identified some categories of documents and again, Mr Lee maintained
his position that the material
would not be made available in circumstances
where they could be obtained on subpoena in the civil proceedings.  It is
important
to note that Mr Lee drew to Mr Woodhouse's attention at this time to
some of the material which Mr Woodhouse requested having been
obtained on
subpoena in the civil proceedings, that he Mr Lee had not read it and could not
arrange access unless permission was
obtained by Mr Woodhouse from the party to
whom the subpoena was addressed.  
<P>

19	The material that Mr Woodhouse then examined was described as "<i>forensic
documentation</i>" compiled by the plaintiff and provided to Mr Lee
confidentiality for the "<i>sole purpose</i>" of Mr Lee advising the plaintiff
in relation to anticipated criminal proceedings and if so advised, providing it
to Mr Woodhouse
in confidence.  The plaintiff had informed Mr Lee that the
material was either created by the plaintiff, third parties at the plaintiff's
request or independently created ("<i>unsolicited"</i>) and subsequently
provided to the plaintiff.
<P>

20	By the time Mr Lee had provided material to Mr Woodhouse on 8 March, he had
seen Police documents which provided particulars
of allegations made against Mr
Marsden and accordingly, the "<i>comments</i>" that he made to Mr Woodhouse and
the material he showed him were directed to the allegations.  Mr Lee states
that if prior to showing
the material to Mr Woodhouse on or after 8 March he
had been told that Mr Woodhouse would produce the material to the solicitors
for the defendant and that Mr Woodhouse would have communicated any of the
content of the material discussed to any persons alleging
misconduct by Mr
Marsden he would not have provided the material to Mr Woodhouse.  
<P>

21	The second affidavit of 20 April establishes that a draft of the first
affidavit was forwarded for approval to Mr Woodhouse who
indicated that he was
happy with the affidavit and believed what Mr Lee said was accurate.
<P>

22	In the third affidavit, namely that of 23 April 1999, Mr Lee deposes to his
belief that Mr Woodhouse and Mr Marsden had <i>precisely the same interest or a
`common interest</i>'" in establishing whether there was sufficient evidence to
warrant the laying of charges against Mr Marsden notwithstanding that
if
charges in fact were laid in the future they would become adversaries.  He also
believed that Mr Woodhouse had agreed that the
only use to which the documents
would be put was part of his <i>"consideration (including the obtaining of
confidential legal advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions) as to
whether charges
should be laid</i>" and that the contents of the documents
would not be made available to Channel 7 or put to individual complainants
unless, of course,
at a future date, charges were laid.
<P>

23	It was argued for the plaintiff that privilege pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s118.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 118</a> of the
<i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act, 1995</a> (NSW) </i>arose in the first instance because the
communications in question as between Mr Marsden and Mr Lee clearly come within
sub-paragraph
(a) of that section being confidential communications made
between the client and a lawyer for the dominant purpose of providing
legal
advice.  This was clearly evidenced by what Mr Lee said in paragraph 24 of his
principal affidavit.  It was to advise Mr Marsden
in relation to
"<i>anticipated criminal proceedings</i>" and, if so advised, providing the
material to Mr Woodhouse in confidence.  No issue of confidentiality arises as
between Mr Marsden
and Mr Lee.
<P>

24	The other basis upon which privilege arises in the first instance is by the
application of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s119.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 119</a> which provides that if there is a confidential
communication between a lawyer acting for a client and another person for the
dominant
purpose of the client being provided with professional legal services
then the privilege will be found to exist.
<P>

25	Contrary to the submissions of Mr Wheelhouse, I am unable to characterise
other than the provision of legal services the purpose
for which the
communication was made between Mr Lee and Mr Woodhouse and that that was a
dominant purpose.
<P>

26	As Mr Pembroke made clear, the scheme of the sections inevitably brings one
back to the meaning of "<i>confidential communication</i>" in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 117.</a>  That is,
in respect to the loss of legal advice privilege <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s118.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 118)</a> it is lost if the
substance of the evidence and the disclosure was knowingly and voluntarily made
in circumstances that did <i>not</i> amount to the making of a confidential
communication.  The "<i>litigation privilege</i>" will be lost if the
communication was not confidential or was not for the dominant of the purpose
being provided with professional
legal services in relation to an anticipated
proceeding in which the client is or may be a party.
<P>

27	There has been a knowing and voluntary disclosure, of that there can be no
question.  But was it a communication, when it was
made, to a person to whom it
was made who was under an express or implied obligation not to "<i>disclose its
contents</i>" whether or not the obligation arises under law?
<P>

28	It is clear on the evidence in relation to the communications particularly
on 8 March but not excluding those on 22 March between
Mr Lee and Mr Woodhouse
that disclosure was anticipated to the Director of Public Prosecutions also,
and this is of critical significance,
disclosure could be anticipated in the
event of criminal proceedings being initiated.  It was argued by Mr Pembroke
that the definition
section which is pivotal makes sense if an "<i>object</i>'
is provided to the verb "<i>to disclose</i>"; otherwise the section can have no
effective operation conformable with what still must be regarded as the
important policy of the
notion of privilege and confidentiality.
<P>

29	As to disclosure to the DPP this was for the purpose of legal advice being
provided by that officer to Superintendent Woodhouse
on the subject of whether
or not there was material available that would warrant the prosecution of Mr
Marsden.  To disclose to the
DPP for that purpose would not be a disclosure (it
being one expressly agreed upon by Mr Woodhouse and Mr Lee) that would render
the otherwise confidential communication not confidential within the terms of
the definition. 
<P>

30	Secondly, it was argued that the anticipated criminal proceedings to which
Mr Marsden may be a party was a contingency only,
not an actuality at the time
of the communication and thus, could play no role in the determination of
whether or not the communication
was confidential, at the time it was made, to
the preserve the privilege notwithstanding the knowing and voluntary
disclosure.
<P>

31	It was argued that this was a matter not addressed by the Court of Appeal in
its judgment of 15 April 1999.  Here I must disagree
with Mr Pembroke.  Taking
into account that clearly there was no suggestion that there would be
disclosure to complainants and taking
into account the fact, if it be relevant,
that the documents were provided for Mr Woodhouse's perusal rather than removal
- the contents
thereby were communicated to him.  Even if the communication to
the DPP for the stated purpose would not not be a disclosure, there
is still
left what Mr Pembroke describes as a "<i>contingency"</i> namely, the possible
prosecution of Mr Marsden.  I do not read anything said by Giles JA in
paragraphs 25 to 29 in particular, as
affording to the status of the
possibility of criminal proceedings being instituted once the DPP had received
the report, of a "<i>contingency"</i> irrelevant at the time of the
communication between Mr Lee and Mr Woodhouse.  Indeed, as I read what his
Honour said in those paragraphs
it is quite clear that if the contents of the
document were disclosed in the course of a prosecution of Mr Marsden the
contents were
passed into the public domain, was an "<i>actuality"</i> )rather
than a contingency) his Honour had in mind in coming to the conclusion that
there was in fact a "<i>disclosure</i>".  As his Honour said in paragraph 29
confidentiality was to be measured not by consent to extinguishing privilege or
confidentiality
or a sense of fairness, but by the words of the definition in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
117(1).</a>  His Honour went on to find in the circumstances to some extent
factually different from the present (no disclosure to complainants)
to hold
that the communication was not made under a express or implied obligation not
to <i>"disclose the contents of the document</i>" within that expression as
used in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 117(1)</a> of the Act.  
<P>

32	At its highest, or at its most stringent, his Honour's construction of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s
117(1)</a> of the Act precludes the characterisation of the potential criminal
proceedings as a "<i>contingency irrelevant at the time of the
communication</i>" and would, in my view, prevent its exclusion as a
disclosure.
<P>

33	Mr Pembroke's argument is persuasive and raises some "<i>nice</i>" points,
but in the light of what Giles JA said in the earlier judgment there is, in my
respectful view, no room for "<i>manoeuvre</i>".  His Honour's construction of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s117.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 117(1)</a> permits of no "<i>object</i>" to the verb "<i>disclose</i>".
<P>

34	This basis for precluding inspection fails.
<P>

35	It is also contended that the waiver provision of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(2)</a> does not apply by
the operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(5)</a> because this was a disclosure to a person with whom
the client or party had at the time of the disclosure a "<i>common
interest</i>" relating to an anticipated proceeding in an Australian Court.
<P>

36	I accept that common interest privilege is not a rigidly defined concept
(<b><i>Farrow Mortgage Services v Webb</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2039%20NSWLR%20601" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 39 NSWLR 601</a> at 609B per
Sheller JA).  I accept also that common interest privilege is not determined by
such considerations as to whether the
two persons or entities said to have the
common interest would retain a <i>"common solicitor</i>" (<b><i>Bulk Material
(Coal Handling) Services Pty Limited v Coal &amp; Allied Operations Pty Limited
</i></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2013%20NSWLR%20689" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 13 NSWLR 689</a> per Giles J at 695F).  
<P>

37	The common interest identified for the plaintiff by Mr Pembroke was the
preparation of the report for the determination by the
Director of Public
Prosecutions as to whether or not criminal proceedings should be instituted
against Mr Marsden.  I am of the view
that this does not properly characterise
any "<i>common interest</i>" at all.  I am persuaded by Mr Wheelhouse's
submissions.  Notwithstanding the evidence of Mr Lee honestly and genuinely
given as
to his belief, the conclusion to be reached is that as far as Mr
Marsden was concerned his interest was to ensure that there be included
in Mr
Woodhouse's report material that would derogate from the DPP concluding that
there was an available case against Mr Marsden:
 that is, a <i>"personal</i>"
or "<i>subjective</i>" interest.  It cannot be said of Detective Superintendent
Woodhouse in the performance of his duty as the investigating officer had
any
equivalent interest.  Indeed, he is "<i>disinterested</i>", in my view.  His
job is to provide the report to the Director for the Director's determination.
The argument that Mr Woodhouse
might have some "<i>personal</i>" interest as an
informant in an unsuccessful prosecution on behalf of the State with a
consequential costs order as a possibility
is ingenuous and I reject it.
Shortly stated, the <i>"real</i>" interest of Mr Marsden was to ensure that he
was not prosecuted at all.  The "<i>interest</i>" of Mr Woodhouse was to lay
before the Director the product of his investigation including the input from
Mr Marsden (but for that
subjective purpose on his part), with a view to the
Director making a decision in accordance with his function.  In that area I
conclude
no "<i>common interest</i>" for the purposes of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(5)(b)</a> has been
established.
<P>

	<b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 125</a> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act, 1995</a> (NSW) </b>
<P>

38	A submission that client legal privilege has been lost by reason of
misconduct pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s125.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 125</a> must be viewed seriously and should not be made
lightly.  Relevantly, it is concerned with a communication made by a client or
a
lawyer (or both) or the party, which was known or ought reasonably to have
been known was made in furtherance of a deliberate abuse
of power.
<P>

39	What we are here concerned with are essentially three categories of
material:  first, the Police documents delivered by Mr Marsden
to Mr Lee in
respect of which it could hardly be disputed that there was a communication
between Mr Lee and Mr Woodhouse and I find
that was about as far as it
reasonably can go.  On no rational basis could it be held that any use by Mr
Lee of documents in fact
provided by Mr Woodhouse in a communication to Mr
Woodhouse was a "<i>deliberate abuse of power</i>" and made in furtherance
thereof.  There was no evidence before me on the application in relation to the
Corrs subpoena from anyone
to suggest that the communications between Mr Lee
and Mr Woodhouse in relation to the Police documents themselves produced by Mr
Woodhouse in answer to the defendant's subpoenas was otherwise than with the
consent of Mr Woodhouse.
<P>

40	In relation to the Department of Community Services documents the evidence
is quite clear that Mr Lee was quite sensitive to
any implied undertaking in
relation to those documents produced by DOCS under subpoena.  He did not read
them and they were not in
fact contained in Exhibits A or B.  Even if arguably
it might be suggested on a prima facie basis that Mr Marsden in some way was
"<i>furthering</i>" a deliberate abuse of power by providing copies of the DOCS
documents to Mr Lee, the evidence is incapable of supporting a conclusion
that
anything more than that happened vis-a-vis Mr Woodhouse.  Whatever may said
against Mr Marsden, Mr Lee's approach to and conduct
in relation to this
material cannot be criticised.
<P>

41	The third category of material is a little more problematical.  It is quite
clear on the evidence that Mr Marsden gave to Mr
Lee an original and a
photocopy of files held by Mr Marsden as a solicitor for D22.  This material is
in fact contained in Exhibit
B.  In relation to this material Mr Lee did not
turn his mind to whether or not Mr Marsden had obtained a waiver of privilege
from
D22.
<P>

42	Mr Lee's evidence is that he simply cannot remember what he did with the
material constituted by those two files in relation
to Mr Woodhouse.  They are
however, as I have said, part of Exhibit B which documents, on the
probabilities, were the subject of
"<i>discussion</i>" with Detective
Superintendent Woodhouse(see paragraph 7 of the principal affidavit of 20 April
1999).  Mr Lee admits that the documents
appear to him to fall within the terms
of the subpoena being documents that he showed to Detective Superintendent
Woodhouse.
<P>

43	I add that the other components of Exhibit B constitute documents relating
to D15 and 16 and one is irrelevant relating to a
non-D person in respect of
which class no access is sought.
<P>

44	Mr Lee gave the following evidence at T1291.1-40:
<P>

<i>	"Q.  And while you have it there Mr Lee maybe I should, is simply ask you
this:  that you understood, did you not, that the information
in the file
provided to you by Mr Marsden concerning D22 was to respond to the allegation
in para 11 of that statement?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  10 and 11, yes.	</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  In other words it was to indicate to Mr Woodhouse the unreliability of
the information in D22's statement particularly in paragraphs
10 and 11.  It
would be fair to say that, wouldn't it?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  And I take it that it was clear to you that the solicitors' file
contained the client's, that is to say, D22's instructions to
Mr Marsden about
the matter in para 11.  I am looking at the first couple of lines?</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  It was really para 11 was the relevant enquiry.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Was it to provide information which would demonstrate or rather
indicate material available for the cross-examination of D22,
should that
occasion arise, to break down his case? </i>
<P>

<i>	A.  You mean in an anticipated criminal proceedings? </i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  Yes? </i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Ultimately yes, but if it was material that I believed if it was
included in a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions
would result in the
DPP saying:  this story simply doesn't stand up.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  And D22's information cannot be relied upon? </i>
<P>

<i>	A.  Yes.</i>
<P>

<i>	Q.  And to round it off, it was the use of the material in D22's file
maintained by his then solicitor Mr Marsden, that Mr Marsden
was going to avail
himself of in order to attack D22's allegation.  That's right isn't it? </i>
<P>

<i>	OBJECTION. (McHUGH) ALLOWED.</i>
<P>

<i>	A.  I think that's a fair characterisation, yes".</i>
<P>

45	When one considers <i>this</i> evidence even from this one cannot gain the
conclusion to the requisite degree of satisfaction that in relation to Mr
Woodhouse,
Mr Lee in fact put to "<i>use</i>" in furtherance of an abuse of
power the material conformably otherwise with what he agreed was Mr Marsden's
intention, namely to
avail himself of it to attack D22's allegation.  
<P>

46	I am not persuaded on the evidence that any conduct by the plaintiff or Mr
Lee amounts the "<i>furtherance of a deliberate abuse of power</i>".  Nor could
I conclude that there was any impropriety on the part of Mr Lee in the light of
the evidence he gave as to his recollection.
 On the contrary, it appears that
Mr Lee has been perfectly candid with the Court in including this material in
relation to D22 as
part of Exhibit B.  For the purposes of the operation of the
section however, the state of the evidence is such as not to persuade
me that
there has any conduct that falls within it that would deprive the plaintiff of
privilege.  
<P>

47	I make the clearly available observation that in any event the defendant has
the benefit of the knowledge of the fact that Mr
Marsden had D22 as a client.
This is not irrelevant to any question of prejudice the plaintiff may seek to
raise in relation to this
particular person as the subject of the Amendment
Application.  And, of course, in the event of leave being granted nothing will
stand in the way of the defendant in having D22 waive any privilege vis-a-vis
his instructions to Mr Marsden as his solicitor.
<P>

	<b>Public interest immunity </b>
<P>

48	Whilst there is a public interest in effective policing and its requirement
of cooperation with the Police of persons under suspicion
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s130.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 130(4)(c)</a> and my
judgments of 19 March and 1 April 1999), subject to the discretion to allow
inspection to which I will shortly come, I am
not persuaded as I was not
persuaded in respect of the earlier judgment delivered today that a basis for
precluding inspection founded
upon a public interest immunity claim is now
available.  I rely upon the reasons stated in my other judgment.  It is quite
clear
in relation to the present application that active investigation my Mr
Woodhouse is at an end and his task was merely to prepare
his report to the
Director of Public Prosecutions for which the plaintiff was desirous of
providing material.  At that point I am
of the view, though not without some
reluctance I must confess, the "<i>public interest</i>" in the cooperation of a
person in the position of the plaintiff is less.
<P>

<i>	</i><b>Discretion</b>
<P>

49	Mr Marsden has been found by the jury to have been defamed.  The defendant
is justifying the imputations found by the jury. 
The imputations allege
criminality.
<P>

50	The defendant has provided particulars of its present case and its proposed
case in respect of which leave to amend is sought.
 It is to be assumed that
the defendant does have a case and does have evidence to call in support of it
in relation to its seeking
to prove to be true that the plaintiff engaged in
the criminal conduct.
<P>

51	The gravity of the imputations need hardly be remarked upon.  The fact that
the defendant proposes to justify them needs hardly
to be remarked upon.  In
simple terms the plaintiff will be facing a "<i>criminal</i>" trial in respect
of his conduct in relation to whatever number of complainants there will be, in
a "<i>civil</i>" action.
<P>

52	The defendant bears the onus of proof and given the nature of the charges it
proposes to prove to be true, the standard of proof
will require a high level
of satisfaction.
<P>

53	I am satisfied that the material in question is critical to the defence by
the plaintiff of these charges.  It goes to the credence
of the defendant's
case and the credibility of its witnesses.
<P>

54	The material cannot be said to be irrelevant to the present or possible
issues in the trial.  Indeed, it must be acknowledged
that the material is
relevant.  Relevance to issues is one thing, the contamination of the process
of adducing evidence on those
issues is another.
<P>

55	One of the fundamental instruments of the common law trial essential to the
uncovering of the truth is the "<i>best available evidence (tested) by the
accepted procedures of cross-examination" (<b>Waind v Hill</b></i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281978%29%201%20NSWLR%20372" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1978) 1
NSWLR 372</a> at 384G).
<P>

56	The defendant will no doubt seek to prove its case by one or more of the
usual forms of evidence, direct, corroborative, circumstantial.
 The first
category will no doubt be made up of the evidence of the complainants and any
"<i>eye-witnesses</i>" whose credibility in such serious criminal matters will
be critical.  Their evidence should be untainted by any notification in
advance
of the mechanisms by which their testimony will be tested in
cross-examination.
<P>

57	Contrary to the submissions for the defendant this is not merely a matter of
forensic advantage:  I am firmly of the view that
any advantage to the
defendant by receiving this information in advance will overwhelmingly be
outweighed by the impediment its reception
will constitute to the purity of the
stream of evidence that normally should be given in a case such as this and so
serious as this
case.
<P>

58	The question of inspection is always one in the discretion of the trial
judge (<b><i>Waind v Hill</i></b> at 383A-C).  The Court of Appeal in that case
endorsed the notion that the trial judge as "<i>a judicial discretion to permit
the use of the documents in any such way as he considers will aid a proper
decision of the issues
between the parties, by facilitating the elucidation of
the truth in respect of relevant facts"</i> (at 383D).
<P>

59	Here there is no question to my mind that the material was confidential and
that which actuates the Court's discretion is whether
the disclosure of the
material to the defendant will clarify or obscure the truth or operate in aid
of its elucidation.
<P>

60	As I have said, the defendant has particularised the case it proposes to
prove;  this material will not advance that case, of
that I am persuaded.  As I
have remarked the complainants' allegations are of grave and indeed, sustained
criminal conduct by the
plaintiff.  At the trial the defendant's witnesses will
be the vehicle for the discharge by the defendant of its onus of proof and
the
object of the cross-examination to the usual end and a particularly important
one in a case of this nature, of testing that witness's
integrity and
credibility:  it is not a question of <i>"ambush</i>" but of the legitimate use
of cross-examination with a view to catching the witness out or surprising the
witness.
<P>

61	I was referred to the decision of Clarke J (as he then was ), in
<b><i>Markus v Provincial Insurance Co Limited </i></b>(unreported, 11 May
1983) where at page 2, his Honour referred, on the question of whether he
should order production for inspection
a certain document, to the defendant's
submissions that the interests of justice would not be served by producing the
document because
it contained material which did not advance the plaintiff's
case but "<i>which on the other hand would, if the plaintiffs are not genuine,
put the plaintiffs on notice of some allegedly suspicious circumstances
and
enable them then to tailor or endeavour to tailor their evidence to meet the
circumstances"</i>.  His Honour came to the view in the context of the case he
was considering that the only purpose to be served by letting the plaintiff
see
the document would be to put them on notice of the allegedly suspicious
circumstances (at page 3).  The defendant was at pains
in the present
application to distinguish this case.  The principles relied upon by his
Honour, in my view, are unaffected by the
circumstances in which he was
considering the exercise of a discretion to deny inspection of a document being
a non-privileged report
of a loss assessor retained by the defendant.
<P>

62	The same principles I am satisfied were appropriately applied by Santow J in
<b><i>Broadwater Taxation &amp; Investment Services v Hendriks
</i></b>(unreported, 9 September  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1993%20BC%209302130" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1993, BC 9302130).</a> His Honour relying upon
<b><i>Markus</i></b> stated that "<i>in all cases, the fundamental touchstone
is what will best serve the course of justice" </i>(at 2).  His Honour noted
that a "<i>helpful way of testing the matter is to ask whether giving access to
the materials would deprive a litigant of a legitimate forensic
advantage -
legitimacy being always determined by asking how the interests of justice would
best be served.  The kind of material
which typically would fall into this
category is typically where one party has taken pains to prepare material to
attack the credit
of the other party"</i>.  His Honour held in that case that
he had to exercise the discretion on the basis that the hypothesis that the
other party's witnesses
"<i>are not genuine" </i>should be accepted at the
interlocutory stage.  It follows that the test is "<i>whether the material
would, if known in advance by the other side - being in this case material
designed to test the other side's
evidence - enable the other side to tailor or
endeavour to tailor their evidence to meet the circumstances" </i>(at 4).
<P>

63	It was submitted for the defendant that the context in both <b><i>Markus
</i></b>and <b><i>Hendriks</i></b> were different.  Of course they are, every
case is different.  But it is the peculiar feature of this case where the
plaintiff will
be in effect in the position of an accused in a criminal trial
that acutely gives rise to the consideration of the undoubted discretion
which
exists.  Not only does it give rise to the exercise of the discretion, in my
view, it properly founds the exercise of the discretion
in favour of precluding
inspection of the material.
<P>

64	In one respect I am persuaded by the defendant on the question of discretion
and that is, in regard to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 135</a> of the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act, 1995</a> (NSW)</i>.  In
<b><i>Tollglen Pty Limited &amp; Anor v Pay TV Holdings Pty Limited &amp;
Ors</i></b> (unreported, Hunter J, 3 March  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1997%20BC%20970311" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">1997, BC 970311)</a> his Honour referred
to questions of whether production and inspection of documents in respect of
which client legal privilege would
otherwise be lost should be denied on the
grounds that the Court would refuse to admit evidence of that material in the
exercise
of the general discretion conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 135.</a>  That question his
Honour considered would appear to raise considerations of "<i>fairness"
</i>analogous with that concept of fairness determinative of the question
whether there has been implied or imputed waiver of legal professional
privilege as expounded in <b><i>Attorney General (NT) v Maurice</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/80.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1986] HCA 80</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281986%29%20161%20CLR%20475" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1986)
161 CLR 475</a> and in <b><i>Goldberg v Ng</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/39.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] HCA 39</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20185%20CLR%2083" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 185 CLR 83:</a>  "<i>the
principal difference appearing to lie in the fact that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 135</a> would apply to a
communication or document in respect of which client legal privilege had been
lost by voluntary and knowing disclosure
within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s122.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 122(2)"</a></i>
whereas <b><i>Maurice</i></b> and <b><i>Ng</i></b> were concerned with implied
or limited waiver of legal professional privilege.  Whilst I accept the
propositions advanced particularly
by Mr Pembroke on the question of discretion
and "<i>fairness</i>", I am not persuaded that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 135</a> is operable at all in this
context.  It is concerned with the admissibility of evidence and "<i>probative
value</i>".  That can never be determined otherwise than in an evidentiary
context.  Indeed, in the whole question of whether or not the material
should
be inspected the Court is not concerned with "<i>admissibility</i>".
<P>

65	The discretion exercised is that which I would simply describe as the one
clearly available on the <b><i>Waind v Hill</i></b> basis.
<P>

66	The prejudice to the plaintiff by the disclosure of the material cannot be
outweighed by any disadvantage to the defendant. 
The defendant is not
disadvantaged, in my view, either in the ultimate action (if ever it is
reached) or the application to amend.
 The defendant has the benefit of knowing
that of which it is being deprived and may make use of the fact of its
existence, if it
chooses so to do, in the amendment application.  The defendant
is not prejudiced in seeking to challenge any question of the plaintiff's
capacity to investigate allegations by being deprived of the material, the
nature of which and indeed the persons with whom it is
concerned being known to
it.  It is available for the purposes of submission that the plaintiff has
investigated allegations made
against him; the non-disclosure does not derogate
from any demonstration of the plaintiff's resources to investigate and given,
especially
in relation to D15 and D16, that the plaintiff is not alleging
prejudice, it seems to me irrelevant for the defendant to assert in
the present
application that to be deprived of the material precludes it from making a
submission that the plaintiff has not disclosed
the true extent from any
investigations into D15 and D16.
<P>

67	Moreover, I reject the submission that the material is of direct relevance
to the cross-examination of the plaintiff.  This is
founded on the proposition
that the material deals with the allegations <i>"of the plaintiff put to the
Police</i>" - that is a proposition that I simply do not understand.  It is
said further that it deals with the relationship between the plaintiff
and D15,
D16, D20 and D22.  Assuming that it does, it does so in the context of
challenging the credibility of the defendant's case
as to the relationship
between the plaintiff and those persons.  It is further contended that the
material may deal with the circumstances
under which D15 and D16 provided
material to the plaintiff:  again, in the present context I simply have no idea
what that means
nor am I able to identify any issue to which it might relate on
the amendment application given that the plaintiff is not asserting
any
prejudice, given that the onus of proof, in any event, is on the defendant and
absent any other exposed considerations, whatever
the subject matter might be
no doubt it is capable of being the subject of evidence from D15 and D16
themselves.  
<P>

68	Thus, in the end I am persuaded that this is an appropriate case for the
exercise of discretion for the reasons I have enunciated
and upon the basis to
which I have referred to preclude inspection by the documents constituted by
Exhibits A, B and C.  
<P>

69	I uphold the claim on behalf of Messrs Corrs Chambers Westgarth to preclude
inspection by the defendant of the material produced
in answer to the subpoena
the subject of the application and for the sake of further clarity, refuse the
defendant access to that
material for inspection.
