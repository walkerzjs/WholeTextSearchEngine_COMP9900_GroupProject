<b>50055/1999 - HALLEN &amp; ANOR  v  ANGLEDAL &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

HIS HONOUR:
<P>

<b>Introduction</b>
<P>

1   	The plaintiffs, for whom Mr P.M. Wood of Counsel appeared,
commenced these proceedings by a Summons filed on 28 April 1999,
whereby they
sought leave to enforce, in the same manner as a judgment of this Court, the
Arbitral Award, ("the Award"), made in
Stockholm, Sweden, on 10 July 1996 in an
arbitration between the plaintiffs and the defendants, for whom Mr A.I. Tonking
of Counsel
appeared, in respect of the sums found by the Arbitrators to be due
by the defendants to the plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs also sought
an order that
judgment be entered in their favour in respect of those sums and an order for
costs.
<P>

2   	The plaintiffs pleaded that on 20 July 1983 Medipac Pty
Limited, ("Medipac"), was registered as a proprietary company in Australia
and
sold medical products, and that prior to 19 February 1993 the plaintiffs and
the defendants each owned four shares in it.  It
was pleaded that on 19
February 1993 the parties entered into a written agreement in the Swedish
language, ("the Agreement"), of
which it was an express term that the
plaintiffs would transfer their shares to the defendants in consideration of a
payment to be
made by the defendants to the plaintiffs, and that it was a
further express term that should any dispute arise with regard to the
validity,
interpretation or suitability of the Agreement, that would be decided by
arbitration in Stockholm, Sweden, in accordance
with applicable legislation.
<P>

3   	The pleading continued that a dispute arose; that
Arbitrators were appointed, although the defendants made no such appointment;
and that on 10 July 1996 the Arbitrators made the Award, a copy of which was
forwarded to the parties on or about 22 July 1996. 
It is not in issue that the
defendants have not paid the amounts referred to in the Award.
<P>

4   	The plaintiffs' contentions are that the Award constituted
a "foreign award" pursuant to the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaa1974276/" class="autolink_findacts">International Arbitration Act 1974</a></b>
(Cth), ("the Act"); that it was made pursuant to the Agreement; and that it may
be recognised and enforced in this Court.
<P>

5   	On 2 June 1999 the defendants filed a Notice of Motion
seeking the following relief:-
<P>

<b>"1.	The proceedings be adjourned pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaa1974276/s8.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.8(8)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaa1974276/" class="autolink_findacts">International
Arbitration Act 1974</a> pending the final determination of the Swedish Court
proceedings referred to in the affidavit of the second defendant sworn on 2
June 1999.</b>
<P>

<b>  2.	Further or in the alternative, the proceedings be stayed until such
time as the plaintiffs have complied with <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.28</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act
1920</a>.</b>
<P>

<b>  3.	The proceedings be removed from the Commercial List of the Equity
Division."</b>
<P>

6   	On the hearing of that Notice of Motion the plaintiffs
filed a Notice of Motion seeking an order that the defendants provide
security
in their favour in the amounts claimed or, in the alternative, in such amount
and in such manner as the Court may determine.
<P>

<b>The Evidence On The Notice Of Motion</b>
<P>

7   	The defendants relied upon the affidavit of the second
defendant, Mrs Margaretha Irene Angledal, sworn on 2 June 1999.  No
objection
was taken to this affidavit and she was not required for cross-examination.
<P>

8   	Mrs Angledal deposed that she received from her solicitors
a copy of the Award in about August 1996, and that she annexed a
true copy of a
translation of the Agreement upon which the plaintiffs proceeded.
<P>

9   	In paragraph 4 she said that without admitting that it was
a binding or enforceable Agreement, that at no time did the plaintiffs
tender
any Transfer of Shares in Medipac to the defendants or anyone acting on their
behalf and, since she received a copy of the
Award and until she was served
with the Summons, neither the plaintiffs nor anyone acting for them had made
any demand on the defendants
for payment of the sum of $307,288.   In paragraph
6 she deposed:-
<P>

<b>"I have instructed my solicitors to engage Advokatbolaget, a firm of lawyers
in Sweden to commence proceedings on behalf of my husband
and myself seeking to
have the `Share Transfer Agreement' declared invalid or unenforceable under
Swedish law and to set aside the
Award.  Annexed hereto and marked `B' is a
true copy of a facsimile transmission from Hans Ohlin of Advokatbolaget dated 1
June 1999
the document initiating those proceedings."</b>
<P>

The annexure comprises a letter in the English language from Mr Ohlin to the
solicitors for the defendants dated 1 June 1999, which
states:-
<P>

<b>"I have now prepared a Summons for Application, a copy of which is attached,
who has been filed in Karlstads tingsratt this day. 
That Summons is a Summons
to Set Aside the Arbitral Award based on The Swedish <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca125/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Act</a>, Article
36."</b>
<P>

The Summons is, apparently, in the Swedish language and I have not been
furnished with a translation of it.  As I am unable to read
that language the
document is of no assistance in the resolution of these proceedings.
<P>

10   	In paragraph 7 Mrs Angledal stated that the defendants
disputed:-
<P>

(a)	The enforceability of the Agreement;
<P>

(b)	The validity of the Award; and
<P>

(c)	The plaintiffs' entitlement, in the event of the Agreement and the Award
being enforceable, which was not admitted, to interest
up to the date of the
commencement of the proceedings and the plaintiffs claim for costs of these
proceedings.
<P>

11   	The evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs was contained in
the affidavit of their solicitor Mr Alister John Abadee, sworn 28
April 1999.
Mr Abadee annexed a copy of the Award, a copy of the Agreement in the Swedish
language, and a translation of the arbitration
clause, which reads:-
<P>

<b>"Arbitration                               Should any dispute arise with
regard to validity, then an interpretation, or the suitability
of this
agreement, or a settlement of the dispute which arisen in connection with it,
shall be decided upon by the Arbitrator in
Stockholm in accordance with the
applicable legislation affected."</b>
<P>

12   	It was not disputed that this was an agreement to refer
disputes under the Agreement to arbitration in Stockholm, nor that
the dispute
had been properly so referred.
<P>

13   	Mr Abadee's affidavit annexed various documentation
showing that Sweden was at the time the Award was made, and remains, a
Convention country, within the meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca125/s3.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.3(1)</a> of the Act, and certain other
formal matters in relation thereto, none of which matters were in issue.
<P>

<b>The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaa1974276/" class="autolink_findacts">International Arbitration Act 1974</a></b>
<P>

14   	The Act is based on the Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, Article I(1) of which provides:-
<P>

<b>"This Convention shall apply to the recognition and enforcement of arbitral
awards made in the territory of a State other than the
State where the
recognition and enforcement of such awards are sought, and arising out of
differences between persons, whether physical
or legal.  It shall also apply to
arbitral awards not considered as domestic awards in the State where their
recognition and enforcement
are sought."</b>
<P>

15   	Article VI provides:-
<P>

<b>"If an application for the setting aside or suspension of the award has been
made to a competent authority referred to in article
V(1)(e), the authority
before which the award is sought to be relied upon may, if it considers it
proper, adjourn the decision on
the enforcement of the award and may also, on
the application of the party claiming enforcement of the award, order the other
party
to give suitable security."</b>
<P>

<b>The Defendants' Notice Of Motion</b>
<P>

16   	The first claim for relief was that the proceedings be
adjourned pursuant to s.8(8) of the Act pending the final determination
by the
Swedish Court of the proceedings instituted by the defendants.
<P>

17   	Section 8(1) provides:-
<P>

<b>"Subject to this Part, a foreign award is binding by virtue of this Act for
all purposes on the parties to the arbitration agreement
in pursuance of which
it was made."</b>
<P>

18   	Sub-section (8) provides:-
<P>

<b>"Where, in any proceedings in which the enforcement of a foreign award by
virtue of this Part is sought, the Court is satisfied that
an application for
the setting aside or suspension of the award has been made to a competent
authority of the country in which, or
under the law of which, the award was
made, the court may, if it considers it proper to do so, adjourn the
proceedings, or so much
of the proceedings as relates to the award, as the case
may be, and may also, on the application of the party claiming enforcement
of
the award, order the other party to give suitable security."</b>
<P>

19   	Mr Tonking submitted that there were three basic reasons
why the Court should exercise its powers, which he conceded were
discretionary
in nature, under sub-s.(8), namely:-
<P>

(a)	The existence of the Swedish proceedings, which I should infer were made to
"a competent authority" in a proper and timely manner
and had, at least prima
facie, prospects of success;
<P>

(b)	The existence of an issue under the <b>New South Wales <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act
1969</a></b>, or the general law, as to whether part of the amount comprised in the
Award, namely $9,000, was payable more than six years after
it was due; and
<P>

(c)	The delay by the plaintiffs from July 1996 until the institution of these
proceedings in making a demand for payment.
<P>

20   	Mr Wood submitted that sub-s.(8) could only be availed of
if the Court is satisfied that an application for the setting aside
or
suspension of the Award has been made to a competent authority in Sweden, in
which case it "may, if it considers it proper to
do so, adjourn the proceedings
...".  He submitted that the Court could not be satisfied of those matters, or
of further matters
relevant to the exercise of discretion, for the following
reasons:-
<P>

(a)	There is no evidence that the Court to which some application has been made
in Sweden is "a competent authority", nor what constitutes
"a competent
authority" in Sweden.
<P>

	On this matter he pointed to the concluding words of the Award, which
stated:-
<P>

<b>"6.	The Parties are reminded of the provision of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s25.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 25</a> of the swedish
Arbitration Act which reads in translation:</b>
<P>

<b>	If a party is dissatisfied with a decision by the arbitrators relative to
the compensation due to them, he may bring the matter before
the court provided
that he commences his action within sixty days from the time when he received
the award.  Each of the arbitrators
has a similar right as regards compensation
claimed by him; but the time for commencing action shall be reckoned from the
day on
which the award was given.  The award shall clearly specify the
procedure to be followed by a party whishing (sic) to proceed against
the
decision of the arbitrators.</b>
<P>

<b>	The name and address of the court referred to in section 25 is: Stockholms
tingsratt, Box 8307, 104  20  Stockholm Sweden."</b>
<P>

Mr Wood drew attention to the fact that whatever application had been made by
Mr Ohlin, it had not been made to that Court, i.e.
Stockholms tingsratt, and
that there was no evidence that the tribunal to which it had been made was
either a competent authority
or in some way authorised to receive any
application on behalf of that specified in the passage I have just quoted.
The absence of
any such evidence is critical to the operation of sub-s.(8), as
there must be an application to a competent authority before reliance
can be
placed on it.
<P>

(b)	He submitted that whatever application has been made, there is no evidence
that it has been made within any applicable time
limitation.  This submission
divided into two.  Firstly, there is no evidence as to whether or not there is
a time limitation and,
secondly, if there is, there is no evidence that the
application was made within it.  This point obtains force from the reference
in
the passage quoted from the Award that proceedings must be commenced within
sixty days from the time when the party complaining
about the Award receives
it.  Accordingly, on this aspect, there is no evidence that whatever
application has been made to whatever
authority is competent from a time point
of view.
<P>

(c)	Thirdly, Mr Wood submitted that in so far as one could make any sense of
the application made in Sweden, it is one based on
Article 36 of the <b>Swedish
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca125/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Act</a></b>, which, at least prima facie, reflects a position opposite to
that taken by the defendants before the Arbitrators, when they asserted
that
the proper law to be applied was that of Australia: pp.14 and 15 of the Award.
At p.21 the Arbitrators found that the law of
Sweden was the applicable law.
That change of position is relevant to note although, on its own, it is not, in
my opinion, decisive.
<P>

(d)	Mr Wood submitted that there is no evidence of the factual basis upon which
the application has been made to the Swedish Court,
other than the reference to
Article 36 of the <b>Swedish <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ca125/" class="autolink_findacts">Contracts Act</a></b>, nor is there any evidence of
what that Article provides nor what is necessary to sustain a submission that
it should be applied,
in some unarticulated way, to the Agreement.  Mr Tonking
submitted that the Court should infer that as a member of the Swedish Bar
has
prepared the application, it is one which has some prospects of success.
However, not only is that not said, but this Court is
left with no idea of the
nature of the claim, other than it is to set aside the Award.  Notwithstanding
what Mr Ohlin has written
Mrs Angledal, in paragraphs 6 and 7 of her affidavit,
makes it clear that that which is being attacked is the Agreement and, by
virtue
of that attack, the Award and its validity.  The failure of Mr Ohlin to
state the nature of the application, other than in the terms
to which I have
referred, and to express any opinion as to its validity and prospects of
success is very strange.  He is the very
person one would expect to speak
favourably about it.  His failure to do so not only does not assist the
defendants in discharging
the onus, but leads to the conclusion that he may not
be able to say anything about it which will assist the defenants.
<P>

(e)	This led to Mr Wood's next submission that the Court does not know whether
the attack is on the Agreement or the Award via an
attack on the Agreement.
<P>

(f)	In view of the width of the arbitration clause it is not clear, and the
defendants have produced no evidence to show, that the
validity of the
Agreement was not susceptible of attack in the arbitration proceedings.  Indeed
the reference to the validity of
the Agreement would indicate that, at least
prima facie, the Arbitrators had power to consider whether it should be set
aside.
<P>

(g)	Mr Wood submitted that there was no evidence of the grounds on which it is
alleged that the Agreement is invalid, which is obviously
so, nor is there any
evidence that even if its validity is impugned the arbitration clause would
fall.  There is no evidence that
any of these points were taken before the
Arbitrators, and the effect, if any, on the defendants' present application to
the Swedish
Court.
<P>

(h)	It was nextly submitted that there is no evidence when the matter will be
heard and that there is no offer of security made.
 Mr Tonking submitted that
the first point was not significant as the Court could maintain some type of
supervisory role over the
proceedings and, if the matter is not heard
expeditiously, cease the adjournment.  The prospect of this Court acting in
that way
in relation to a foreign Court has obvious objectionable features, the
more so as there is no evidence of the time delays, if any,
in that Court and
the pressure of work on it.
<P>

(i)	Finally Mr Wood submitted that the Court should have regard to the Award
itself.  He conceded that there will no doubt be cases
where such an Award, on
its face, would give rise to doubts as to its inherent validity and worth from
which a Judge may be able
to draw a conclusion that it is not satisfactory.
However, he contended that the present Award is well reasoned, balanced and in
certain respects in favour of the defendants in so far as they have made points
with which the Arbitrators agree.  I should pause
here to note that although
the defendants did not appear at the hearing, they none-the-less made written
submissions and furnished
other material to the Arbitrators and in the Award,
which covers some twenty four pages, the Arbitrators appear, if I may say so
with respect, to deal with the matters in issue with great care.
<P>

21   	In all these circumstances Mr Wood submitted that there
was no evidence that the operation of sub-s.(8) was activated and,
even it was,
there was nothing to attract the exercise of discretion in favour of the
defendants, it not being in issue that the
making of an order involves
essentially discretionary considerations.
<P>

22   	In my respectful opinion, Mr Wood's submissions must be
accepted.  For all the reasons he has outlined I do not consider that
the
defendants have established that the necessary application has been made to a
competent authority in Sweden and, even if I were
to take the view that the
application to which Mr Ohlin referred was an appropriate one to attract
sub-s.(8), I  cannot be satisfied,
for all the reasons advanced, even at a
prima facie level, that it has any prospects of success, such that I should
adjourn the proceedings.
<P>

23   	Mr Tonking submitted that it would be a wrong exercise of
discretion not to take that course in circumstances where there
was an
application before some tribunal in Sweden, which could be rendered nugatory by
not granting an adjournment.  Mr Wood submitted,
correctly in my opinion, that
sub-s.(8) does not demand that an adjournment be granted without more.  It not
only specifies a certain
matter, which must be met before an adjournment is
granted, but it invests the Court with a general discretion.  It does not
authorise
the Court to grant an adjournment merely because an application in
relation to the Award has been made in the country in which the
Award was made.
More must be established than that.
<P>

24   	Counsel advised me that their researches had not disclosed
any Australian cases bearing on this point.  I was referred to
several overseas
authorities.  In <b>Fertiliser Corporation of India et al v IDI Management
Inc</b> (1981) 517 FD 948 proceedings were brought in the United States to
enforce an award made in India.  The Court was of the view that
the award must
be confirmed unless one of the defences raised by the defendant was found to
exist, or the Court chose to adjourn
the proceedings "under Article VI".  After
referring to the various defences the Court turned to the question of
adjournment.  After
quoting Article VI, it said:-
<P>

<b>"This appears to be an unfettered grant of discretion; the court has been
unable to discover any standard on which a decision to adjourn
should be based,
other than to ascertain that an application to set aside or suspend the award
has been made.  Here, it is undisputed
that IDI has made such an application in
India."</b>
<P>

25   	It is disputed in the present case that the defendants
have made the appropriate application in Sweden, and the defendants
have not
proved that they have.
<P>

26   	At p.962 it was stated:-
<P>

<b>"Nevertheless, in order to avoid the possibility of an inconsistent result,
this Court has determined to adjourn its decision on enforcement
of the
Nitrophosphate Award until the Indian Courts decide with finality whether the
award is correct under Indian law.  FCI, of
course, may apply to this Court for
suitable security, as provided by Article VI.</b>
<P>

<b>When we are informed that the Indian Courts have reviewed the Nitrophosphate
Award and rendered a decision, we will proceed to either
grant or deny
enforcement, based on that decision."</b>
<P>

27   	As I have said in that case there was no issue but that an
appropriate application had been made to a competent authority
in India, and
the Court seems to have been of the view that the proper exercise of
discretion, in order to avoid the possibility
of an inconsistent result, was to
grant the application, subject to a counter application for security.
<P>

28   	This decision was reviewed in an article: "Staying
Enforcement of Arbitral Awards Under the New York Convention", "Arbitration
International" at p.209.
<P>

29   	At p.222 the author stated:-
<P>

<b>"It is submitted that the appropriate standard for applying Article VI of
the New York Convention should not be the mere possibility
or even the
probability of inconsistent results, but rather a balancing of the relative
prejudices to the parties.  Prejudice inures
to the winning party to the
arbitration in almost every case: that party is deprived of substantial sums of
money owed, often for
many years, from the date of the initial breach of the
obligation, through not only the arbitral proceedings but also judicial
proceedings
contesting the validity of the award."</b>
<P>

30   	The reason for coming to the first mentioned conclusion
appears on p.221, where it was written:-
<P>

<b>"Moreover, even if an award is set aside in the country of origin after it
is enforced elsewhere, the result would not be legal chaos
because the
judgement setting aside the award would most likely be recognised abroad to
recover any monies collected under the award."</b>
<P>

31   	In <b>Hebei Import &amp; Export Corp v Polytek Engineering
Co Limited</b> (High Court of Hong Kong - 1 November 1996 - unreported) a far
higher onus was imposed upon the defendant by Leonard J, who adopted,
at least
to some extent, a discussion by Jan Van den Berg in "The New York Arbitration
Convention of 1958: Towards a Uniform Interpretation".
 After referring to what
had been written, his Lordship continued:-
<P>

<b>"The burden must be on the defendant in this case to show that the
application has been made to the Chinese Court and that it is a
bona fide
application, not made only with a view to delaying payment.  If it appears that
the application is hopeless and bound to
fail, this Court will not grant an
adjournment.  It is for the defendant to show that it has some reasonably
arguable grounds which
afford some prospects of success.  I think it is going
too far to say that the defendant must show that he is likely to succeed.
There is no doubt that the application has been made and that it has been
accepted by the Beijing No 2 People's Court.  Mr Tang submits
that the very
fact that the application has been accepted indicates that the Chinese Court
thinks that there is something in it worthy
of consideration.  There is no
expert evidence on the matter but it is perhaps reasonable to suppose that
before it issued its Notice
of Acceptance, the Court must have carried out some
sort of examination of the contents of the application before accepting
it.</b>
<P>

<b>There is some prima facie evidence that there is some prospect of success
for the applicant in Beijing.  It is to be found in the
affirmation of Mr Lau
.. who says that the defendant's legal advisers in Beijing have advised that
the defendant has an arguable
case for setting aside the award on certain
grounds which he sets out in his affidavit.  He does refer to certain parts of
the Law
of Arbitration in China but he is not an expert witness and it is not
possible for me to make any findings of fact as to what the
law actually is.
Nevertheless, having regard to the fact that he speaks of having received
advice from Beijing lawyers, what he says
in his affidavit does afford some
prima facie evidence of their views."</b>
<P>

Subsequently his Lordship said:-
<P>

<b>"Taking into account all the circumstances, I have decided in my discretion
to accede to the defendant's application to adjourn the
hearing of the Summons
of 13 August 1996, sine dei, pending the outcome of the application which is
currently before the Beijing
No 2 People's Court, with liberty to restore.  I
am conscious of the fact that so far as this Court is aware no date has yet
been
set for the hearing in China.  If there were to be a substantial delay in
the progress of proceeding in China, it may be that the
plaintiff would want to
come back to this Court to ask it to re-consider the question as to when the
Summons ought to be heard."</b>
<P>

32   	His Lordship made the points that the defendant had the
obligation of showing some reasonably arguable grounds, which afforded
it "some
prospect of success".  He also had a situation before him that the application
had been accepted, it not being in issue
that an application had been made to
the competent authority, and he was prepared to infer that some sort of
examination had been
made before such acceptance.  Further, and significantly
in my view, there was some evidence, albeit, perhaps, of less than a
satisfactory
nature, that the defendant had an arguable case.
<P>

33   	It is the absence of all these indicia in the present
case, which support the submissions of Mr Wood that for want of proper
evidence
and as a matter of discretion the application should be refused. In my opinion
the defendants have not established that
the existence of some proceedings in
Sweden can or should cause this Court to grant the adjournment sought either as
a matter of
fact or discretion.
<P>

<b>The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a> Point</b>
<P>

34   	<b>The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/" class="autolink_findacts">Limitation Act</a></b> point must, in my opinion, fail.
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 20</a> is not concerned with a limitation on components of the cause of
action giving rise to the arbitration, but with the cause of action
to enforce
an award by the institution of proceedings, rather than by the method provided
in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/la1969133/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.33</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/" class="autolink_findacts">Commercial Arbitration Act 1984</a></b>.  So much is made clear
not only by the opening words of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.20(1)</a>, which are concerned with a cause of
action "to enforce an award of an arbitrator", but also by the terms of
sub-ss.(2) and, more
especially, (3).  In the end, whilst I did not understand
Mr Tonking to abandon his submission on this point, it became clear that
it was
no longer pressed with any enthusiasm.
<P>

35   	In <b>Brali v Hyundai Corporation</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2015%20NSWLR%20734" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1988) 15 NSWLR 734</a>
Rogers CJ at CommD dealt, inter alia, with the cause of action, noting that a
person wishing to enforce an award may either bring
an action on it or follow
the summary procedure in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s33.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.33(1).</a>
<P>

36   	At p.743 his Honour said:-
<P>

<b>"In the absence of argument from the defendant, I am content to proceed on
the hypothesis that an action may lie on an implied promise
in the award itself
..."</b>
<P>

His Honour cited authority, and continued:-
<P>

<b>"The Court does have jurisdiction to allow or to confirm service on a
defendant outside the jurisdiction on the cause of action arising
from an award
deemed to have been made within the jurisdiction.  This conclusion is
consistent with one of the principal purposes
of the New York
Convention."</b>
<P>

This is the cause of action with which <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s20.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.20</a> is concerned, and it was not
submitted that it was time barred.
<P>

<b>The Absence Of Any Demand For Payment</b>
<P>

37   	The third matter upon which Mr Tonking relied was the
absence of any demand for payment.  In my opinion this does not provide
a
discretionary basis for denying the plaintiff's the right to enforce the Award.
There is no evidence that, in consequence of the
delay, the defendants have
suffered any prejudice.  Rather, it would seem, they have not exercised any
right they may have to set
aside the agreement until recently.
<P>

<b>The Stamp Duty Point</b>
<P>

38   	Mr Tonking submitted that prima facie the Agreement needed
to be stamped and that, as it does not appear that it has been,
the plaintiffs
cannot rely on it in these proceedings, as they are seeking to do.  His
submission was that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/caa1984219/s29.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.29(1)</a> of the <b><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/" class="autolink_findacts">Stamp Duties Act 1920</a></b> provides that
"except as aforesaid", an instrument shall not be used in proceedings, other
than criminal proceedings, "for any purpose
whatsoever, unless it is duly
stamped in accordance with the law enforced at the time when it was first
executed".
<P>

39   	Mr Tonking submitted that it will be necessary for the
plaintiffs to rely upon the Agreement in the main proceedings because,
pursuant
to s.9(1)(b) of the Act, the plaintiffs must produce in any proceedings to
enforce the Award a duly authenticated original
Award or duly certified copy
thereof, and the original Arbitration Agreement under which the Award purports
to have been made or
a duly certified copy thereof.
<P>

40   	In these circumstances Mr Tonking submitted that the
plaintiffs would not be able to prove their case.  Mr Wood responded
that,
firstly, the submission was not open to Mr Tonking because a copy of the
Agreement was put in evidence through the affidavit
of Mrs Angledal and
therefore, in so far as it is relevant at the moment, the document has been put
in evidence by the defendants.
 That may not necessarily overcome the position
on a final hearing.
<P>

41   	Secondly, Mr Wood submitted that at the time of the
hearing the document would be admissible, notwithstanding that it is not
stamped, by virtue of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s29.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.29(4).</a>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s27.html" class="autolink_findacts">Sections 27</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s28.html" class="autolink_findacts">28</a> provide for circumstances in
which an unstamped document may be admitted into evidence, and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s29.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.29(4)</a>
provides:-
<P>

<b>"Sections 27 and 28 and this section do not apply to an instrument or a copy
of an instrument tendered as evidence on behalf of a
party (not being a person
who is primarily liable to duty in respect of the instrument) if the court is
satisfied:</b>
<P>

<b>(a)	that the party has informed, or will in accordance with arrangements
approved by the court inform, the Chief Commissioner of the
name of the person
primarily liable to duty in respect of the instrument; and</b>
<P>

<b>(b)	that the party will, in accordance with arrangements approved by the
court, lodge the instrument or a copy of the instrument with
the Chief
Commissioner."</b>
<P>

42   	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_act/sda1920157/s7.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 7</a> provides that the Schedules to that Act, and
everything contained within them, shall be read and construed as part of the
Act.  The
Schedule, under a heading "Transfer of Shares", makes the transferee,
i.e. the defendants, the persons primarily liable for the payment
of stamp
duty.
<P>

43   	Accordingly, Mr Wood submitted that on the hearing of his
clients' Summons, if it was necessary to tender the whole of the
Agreement,
that would be a tender by the persons not primarily liable to duty in respect
of it and, thereupon, the plaintiffs would
be able to satisfy the Court that
they would inform the Chief Commissioner that the defendants are primarily
liable to duty in respect
of it and that they would, in accordance with
arrangements approved by the Court, lodge the instrument with the Chief
Commissioner.
<P>

44   	In these circumstances it would seem that the time for
being concerned about the payment of stamp duty has not arisen and,
if and when
it does, it will be a matter which the plaintiffs will be able to overcome
without difficulty.
<P>

45   	Mr Wood's third submission is that it may not, in any
event, be necessary for the plaintiffs to tender the whole of the Agreement,
because the relevant portion of it is that which provides for arbitration and
the Summons may only need to rely upon the Agreement
as pleaded in paragraph 3
of the Nature of  Dispute and paragraph 5 thereof.  If those paragraphs are
admitted there will be no need
to tender the Agreement.
<P>

46   	For the reasons, and more particularly the second reason,
submitted by Mr Wood I do not consider that there is any justification
to stay
the proceedings until the plaintiffs have paid stamp duty.
<P>

<b>Transfer Of The Proceedings</b>
<P>

47   	Mr Tonking submitted that the proceedings should remain in
the general Equity Division List rather than being transferred
to the
Commercial List in the Equity Division.  The basis for this submission was that
the proceedings did not give rise to any matter
of trade or commerce requiring
the specialist attention of the Commercial List.
<P>

48   	I do not agree with this submission.  Matters involving
arbitral awards are frequently heard in the Commercial List.  The
present case
raises a somewhat novel point and, although in a slightly different context,
Rogers CJCommD had no difficulty with the
concept that the matter should be
heard in the Commercial Division in <b>Brali v Hyundai Corporation</b>.
<P>

49   	In my opinion there are ample reasons why the present
proceedings should be heard in the Commercial List.
<P>

<b>Matters In Reply</b>
<P>

50   	Mr Tonking submitted that the submissions of Mr Wood in
relation to the exercise of discretion pursuant to s.8(8) were directed
to the
absence of evidence from the defendants about the proceedings they had
instituted in Sweden.  He submitted that this Court
should not go behind the
Award at this stage.  The difficulty those submissions raise are that the onus
is on the defendants to demonstrate
that the proceedings should be adjourned
pending the final determination of the proceedings in the Swedish Court.  It
seems to me
fundamental, if the defendants are to discharge that onus, that
they demonstrate, at least at a prima facie level, that the Swedish
proceedings
are proceedings, which fall within s.8(8).  Firstly, they must be proceedings
to a competent authority.  Secondly, they
must be proceedings for the setting
aside or suspension of the Award.  Thirdly, there must be some evidence to show
that there is
a prima facie or reasonably arguable case.  This has a number of
other requirements, including that the proceedings are brought within
time and
are otherwise competent.  The defendants' submission was that I should infer
from Mr Ohlin's letter that these requirements
had been met and, to some
extent, the submission was made that as the matter had come on as one of
urgency there had not been sufficient
time to obtain other evidence in relation
to the nature of the proceedings.  I do not consider that it is appropriate to
draw the
inference from Mr Ohlin's letter for which the defendants contend.
There is absolutely no reason why Mr Ohlin could not have produced
some
material, which would have indicated that the proceedings were of the
appropriate nature, brought within time and such as to
show a prima facie case.
Further, in this case, the proceedings in Sweden are brought in relation to the
validity of the Agreement
and there is no evidence to suggest how that is
necessarily related to setting aside or suspending the Award.
<P>

51   	So far as the question of time available to obtain further
evidence is concerned, I raised expressly with Mr Tonking that
there was no
application for an adjournment by the defendants to produce further evidence,
and he made no such application.  Accordingly,
the proper course is to
determine his clients' Notice of Motion on the available evidence.
<P>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>

52   	In my opinion the defendants' Notice of Motion filed on 2
June 1999 must be dismissed with costs.  In these circumstances
it becomes
unnecessary to consider the plaintiffs' Notice of Motion for security.  I
think, however, that it is appropriate to stand
that over lest there be an
appeal from my decision, the result of which renders it necessary for
consideration to be given to that
aspect of the matter.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

53   	I order that:-
<P>

(a)	The defendants' Notice of Motion filed on 2 June 1999 be dismissed with
costs.
<P>

(b)	The plaintiffs' Notice of Motion filed on 7 June 1999 be stood over to 11
June 1999.
<P>

(c)	The proceedings be stood over to 11 June 1999 for directions.
