<b>2690/99 - BARRY WILSON HEAPS &amp; 1 OR  V  ADDISON WESLEY LONGMAN AUSTRALIA
PTY LTD</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (ex tempore;  revised 8 November 1999)</b>
<P>

1  	HIS HONOUR:  These proceedings were commenced by summons filed on
11 June 1999.  By that summons the plaintiff sought declaratory
relief with
respect to the proper construction of clause 4.3.7 of the lease between the
plaintiffs as landlords and the defendant
as tenant with respect to units A1
and A2, 6-8 Byfield Street, North Ryde (`Lease'), and with respect to the
validity of a determination
by the umpire pursuant to that clause.  The
plaintiffs also sought specific performance, damages and other relief.
<P>

2  	On 24 August 1999 Registrar Berecry made orders placing this
matter in the short matters list for the resolution of a `preliminary
issue',
that issue being determination of the plaintiffs' entitlement to the
declarations sought in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the summons.
 Those are the
paragraphs concerning the proper construction of clause 4.3.7 of the lease and
the validity of the umpire's determination.
 The matter came before me for
determination of the preliminary issue.
<P>

3  	Counsel for both parties agreed that the `preliminary issue' is,
in fact, the determination of a separate question under Pt
31 of the Supreme
Court Rules.  After discussion, the parties agreed on a fresh formulation of
the separate question in substitution
for the formulation made by the
Registrar.  As now formulated the separate question is as follows:
<P>

`Did the appointment of the umpire (R Aitken) cease prior to the umpire's
letter dated 19 March 1998?'
<P>

4  	I propose to make orders vacating the Registrar's orders with
respect to the separate question and substituting an order for
the
determination of the above question under Pt 31.  For reasons which I shall
indicate, my answer to the new separate question
is `yes'.
<P>

5  	For the purpose of determination of the separate question, the
parties ultimately agreed to rely on only a limited portion of
the evidence
which was adduced in the application before me today.  The limited evidence is
the following: Exhibit BH1 to the affidavit
of Barry Wilson Heaps, sworn on 8
June 1999 (the Lease); Exhibits AM5, AM6, AM7 and AM8 to the affidavit of
Anthony Edward Morris
sworn on 30 June 1999; Exhibits MA1, MA2, MA3, MA7 and
MA21 to the affidavit of Martin Ian Alfonso sworn on 2 June 1999; and Exhibit
PX4 in the proceedings comprising copies of two letters by Mr Aitken, dated 19
March 1999, to Messrs Martin and Gothard respectively,
and Mr Aitken's work
notes.
<P>

<b>The Lease</b>
<P>

6  	The Lease is for a term of seven years commencing on 1 January
1994 and terminating on 31 December 2000.  The rent is calculated
in accordance
with Part 4, which deals with `base rent' and the lessee's contribution.
Clause 4.1 deals with the payment of the base
rent.
<P>

7  	Clause 4.2 deals with the review of the base rent and sets up a
procedure by which the lessor may notify the lessee in writing
not earlier than
three months prior to, or later than three months subsequent to, each review
date of the lessor's assessment of
the base rent to apply from that review
date.  In the present case the lessor invoked that procedure for a review to be
effective
on 1 January 1998. Clause 4.2 provides that if the lessor and the
lessee are unable to agree upon the base rent to apply from a review
date, the
lessee may require a review of the base rent, determined in accordance with
clause 4.3.  Clause 4.3 is headed `Dispute
of Lessor's Assessment on Review of
Base Rent - Expert Determination Procedure'.  Clause 4.3 was invoked by the
lessee from the present
case.
<P>

8  	The procedure set out in clause 4.3 involves the lessee giving
the lessor a notice of dispute and nominating a qualified valuer
within a
stated time.  The lessor must respond by also nominating a qualified valuer.
The valuers so nominated are then required
within 21 days to determine jointly
the base rent as at the review date.  If they do so their determination is
final and binding
on the parties.  There are provisions dealing with the
determination of the base rent in the event that the lessor or lessee fails
to
nominate a valuer.
<P>

9  	Clause 4.3.7, which is the crucial clause in this case, deals
with the procedure in the event that the nominated valuers are
unable to agree
on the base rent.  It says:
<P>

`Should the valuers be unable to agree on the Base Rent of the Premises within
the period referred to in Clause 4.3.3 or within
such extended period as the
Lessor and the Lessee may agree in writing then:-
<P>

(i)	if the Base Rent as assessed by the valuer nominated by the Lessee is more
than that assessed by the valuer nominated by the
Lessor then the Base Rent of
the Premises shall be as determined by the Lessee's valuer;
<P>

(ii)	if the difference between the respective assessments of the valuers is not
greater than 1.75% of the aggregate of their assessments
then the Base Rent of
the Premises from the particular Review Date shall be deemed to be one half of
the aggregate of the said assessments;
<P>

(iii)	all the circumstances other than those covered by paragraphs (i) and (ii)
of this Clause 4.3.7 the valuers shall agree upon
and appoint a valuer also
being qualified in the manner provided in Clause 4.3.6 (`the umpire'),  and
obtain the umpire's acceptance
in writing of his appointment and who as a
condition of his acceptance will undertake to hand down his determination of
the Base
Rent within twenty-one (21) days of his being instructed to proceed
with his determination;
<P>

(iv)	if the valuers are unable to agree upon the nomination of the umpire or
for any reason whatsoever fail to appoint the umpire
within a further seven (7)
days following the 21 days referred to in Clause 4.3.3 or within such extended
period as the Lessor and
the Lessee may agree in writing or if either or both
valuers have failed to assess the Base Rent within the period referred to in
Clause 4.3.3 or within such extended period as the Lessor and the Lessee may
agree in writing, then either valuer either party may
request the President of
the Australian Institute of Valuers and Land Economists (New South Wales
Division) to make an appointment
of the umpire who must:-
<P>

A.	be a valuer qualified the manner provided in sub-clause 4.3.6;
<P>

B.	as a condition of his acceptance of the appointment undertake to hand down
his determination of the Base Rent within twenty-one
(21) days of his being
instructed to proceed with his determination; and
<P>

C.	not be a person previously nominated by a valuer whose appointment has not
been agreed to by the valuers pursuant to this paragraph:
<P>

(v)	should it be necessary for the umpire to determine the Base Rent, his
determination shall be final and binding on the parties
hereto;
<P>

(vi)	if an umpire appointed under this paragraph fails to hand down his
determination on the Base Rent within the required period
or within such
extended period as the Lessor and the Lessee may agree in writing, then either
party may make a fresh request for
the appointment of a substitute umpire under
this paragraph and thereupon the appointment of any umpire previously appointed
pursuant
to this clause shall cease without limitation no fee or other payment
shall be payable to such person.'
<P>

10  	For the purposes of the present case the crucial elements of
4.3.7 are these.  First, sub-paragraph (iii) requires the valuers
to `agree
upon and appoint' an umpire who is a qualified valuer and obtain the umpire's
acceptance of the appointment and his undertaking
to hand down his
determination within 21 days.
<P>

11  	Next, sub-paragraph (iv) deals with two circumstances, namely,
the case where the valuers are unable to agree upon the nomination
of the
umpire or fail to appoint an umpire within a stated period, and secondly, the
case where either or both valuers have failed
to assess the base rent within a
stated period.  In either of those cases sub-paragraph (iv) permits either
party to request the
President of the Australian Institute of Valuers to
appoint the umpire.
<P>

12  	In the present case the evidence shows that on 23 January 1998
the lessee's valuer approached Mr Aitken proposing that he be
appointed as
umpire under clause 4.3.7.  On 6 February 1998 Mr Aitken wrote to both the
lessor's valuer and the lessee's valuer confirming
that he was able to accept
the appointment.  Mr Aitken's diary notes indicate that on 9 February 1998 he
received a fax from the
lessee's valuer confirming his appointment and also had
a conversation with the lessor's valuer confirming his appointment.
Consequently,
his appointment as umpire took effect under sub-paragraph (iii)
on 9 February 1998.  Mr Aitken forwarded his determination as umpire
to the
valuers for the lessor and lessee on 19 March 1998, well outside the period of
21 days in which he had undertaken to hand
down his determination.  The
determination itself is dated 11 March 1998.
<P>

13  	As shall become evident, if the determination had been made on
11 March 1999 then it would have preceded the plaintiffs' attempt
to invoke
sub-paragraph (vi) of clause 4.3.7.  Although it was outside the 21 day period,
it would arguably have been an effective
determination even assuming that the
plaintiffs had been successful in invoking paragraph (vi) on the following day.
But it has not
been submitted to me that the determination was `handed down' so
as to become effective on 11 March rather than on 19 March 1998
when it was
transmitted to the valuers.  On the limited evidence before me I am unable to
find that the determination was handed
down before 19 March 1998.
<P>

14  	On 12 March 1998 the lessor's solicitors wrote three letters to
the lessee's solicitors.  One of those letters (`the Election
Letter') was in
the following terms:
<P>

`RE:  HEAPS LEASE TO ADDISON WESLEY LONGMAN PTY LTD SUB-LEASE TO TODAYTECH
WHOLESALE (AUST) PTY LTD
<P>

We refer to our letter of 16 January 1998.
<P>

We are instructed to advise you that under Clause 4.3.7(vi) of the Lease, our
client elects to make a fresh request for the appointment
of a substitute
umpire under paragraph 4.3.7 of the Lease.  Our client proposes that the new
umpire be Mr Tom Phelan, Knight Frank,
Elizabeth Plaza, North Sydney.
<P>

Would you please confirm if your client agrees with our nomination of a new
umpire failing which a request will be made to the President
of the Australian
Institute of Valuers and Land Economists (NSW Division).
<P>

We look forward to hearing from you.
<P>

Yours faithfully,
<P>

EDGINGTON &amp; ALFONSO'
<P>

15  	The other two letters were, first, a letter alleging that the
lessee had breached clause 4.3.6 of the Lease in that the valuer
appointed by
the lessee had failed to provide a determination, and, second, a letter
alleging that the lessee had breached 4.3.12
of the lease by not paying the
base rent specified in the lessor's rent review notice from the relevant rent
review date.  It is
unnecessary for me to determine whether the second and
third letters made valid claims.
<P>

16  	Counsel for the defendant submitted that the second and third
letters shed light on the intention of the author of the Election
Letter.  I
reject that submission.  It seems to me that the letters are equally plausibly
interpreted as showing the intention to
invoke as many remedies under the Lease
as the ingenuity of the solicitor could conjure up in obviously limited time.
The Election
Letter is to be construed in accordance with its terms and, in my
opinion, it has a clear and plain meaning.
<P>

17  	The answer to the separate question requires the Court, first,
to construe clause 4.3.7 and, in particular,  sub-paragraph
(vi) of that
clause.  Second, it requires the Court to construe the Election Letter to
determine whether it constitutes a `fresh
request' for the purposes of
sub-paragraph (vi).   I shall address these two issues in turn.
<P>

<b>The Proper Construction of Sub-paragraph (vi)</b>
<P>

18  	Sub-paragraph (vi) applies if an umpire `appointed under this
paragraph' fails to hand down his determination of the base rent
within the
required period.  There is no suggestion in the evidence before me that there
was any extension of time, and therefore
the required period was 21 days from
the time of his appointment on 9 February 1998.  It is plain from the facts
that Mr Aitken failed
to hand down his determination of the base rent within
that period.
<P>

19  	There is a question whether Mr Aitken was, in the circumstances,
`an umpire appointed under this paragraph'. In my view he
clearly was, although
I acknowledge that to reach that view I must take a somewhat generous approach
to the construction of the word
`paragraph'.  I am fortified in doing so by the
knowledge that neither party before me submitted that Mr Aitken was not within
that
description.  In my view the word `paragraph' where it first appears in
sub-clause (vi) is a reference to clause 4.3.7 as a whole,
including both
sub-paragraphs (iii) and (iv).  Since Mr Aitken was appointed under
sub-paragraph (iii) he qualifies as `an umpire
appointed under this paragraph'
so construed.  Consequently, sub-paragraph (vi) applies.
<P>

20  	Where it applies sub-paragraph (vi) allows either party to make
a `fresh request for the appointment of a substitute umpire
under this
paragraph'.  This time the words `this paragraph', in `fresh request ... under
this paragraph', clearly refer to sub-paragraph
(vi).  If as a matter of fact,
either party does so, then sub-paragraph (vi) spells out the consequence,
namely that the appointment
of any umpire previously appointed pursuant to this
clause (that is clause 4.3.7) ceases.  
<P>

21  	The only controversial question is whether, it being clear that
the defendant has not done so, the plaintiffs have made such
a fresh request.
The plaintiffs say that they have done so, and what is more, that they did so
on 12 March 1998 by means of the Election
Letter, prior to Mr Aitken making the
determination of 19 March 1998.  Consequently, say the plaintiffs, Mr Aitken's
office as umpire
had ceased prior to his determination.
<P>

22  	In my opinion the words `fresh request for the appointment of a
substitute umpire' in sub-paragraph (vi) refer to the process
of appointment of
an umpire  described in sub-paragraph (iv).
<P>

23  	The plaintiffs seek to resist this construction on several
grounds.  First, they say that the words `fresh request' would be
capable of
applying, on this construction, only if a request had already been made under
sub-paragraph (iv), and in the present case
no such request has been made.  It
seems to me that the words `fresh request' are not limited to circumstances
where, as a matter
of fact, a request has already been made under sub-paragraph
(iv).  Rather those words contemplate that the request made for the
purposes of
sub-paragraph (vi) must be `fresh' in the sense of `new' and `different from'
any request which may have been made under
sub-paragraph (iv).  In other words,
whether or not a request has already been made under sub-paragraph (iv), what
is contemplated
by sub-paragraph (vi) is a new request for the appointment of
an umpire by the President under the sub-paragraph (iv) procedure.
<P>

24  	The plaintiffs also say that the construction which I favour
would create difficulty because it would prevent a party from
seeking to
replace the recalcitrant umpire with a new umpire by agreement.  They say that
if the parties were to reach agreement
as to a replacement umpire, there would
be two umpires in place.  The plaintiffs urge me to prefer a construction which
would allow
the words `fresh request' to encompass a case where a new umpire is
appointed by agreement of the parties.
<P>

25  	In my opinion the construction which I favour does not prevent
the parties to the Lease, who are the only parties to this contract,
agreeing
to modify the terms of clause 4.3.7 to whatever extent they choose.  For
example, the parties could agree, in circumstances
to which sub-paragraph (vi)
were otherwise applicable, that they would select an umpire without approaching
the President, and that
their doing so would have the effect of extinguishing
the office of the existing umpire.  That variation to the existing arrangement
would be valid, assuming there were no vitiating elements.  If the parties
agreed upon the identity of a replacement umpire but omitted
to deal with the
status of the existing umpire, then a degree of confusion could well arise.  It
may be that a proper construction
of what they had done would lead to the
inference that the office of the existing umpire had been extinguished by their
consent;
or alternatively, a proper construction of their new agreement may be
that the two umpires would remain in office until some further
event happened,
such as the delivery of a determination by the quicker of the two.  All of
those matters are matters of construction
of an agreement by commercial
parties, of a kind with which this Court is very familiar.
<P>

26  	The plaintiffs' contention that the construction which I favour
would prevent the parties from agreeing on a replacement umpire
fails because
it overlooks the ability of the parties to vary their contract.
<P>

27  	The plaintiffs also say it cannot be the case that the entire
procedure in sub-paragraph (iv) is to be followed in the event
that a `fresh
request' is made under sub-paragraph (vi).  I agree.  The prerequisites for the
first application for sub-paragraph
(iv) are clearly irrelevant in the event
that a fresh request is made for appointment under sub-paragraph (vi), because
those prerequisites
are directed towards an earlier point of time when valuers
have been engaged and their offices are still live.  The effect of treating
the
words `fresh request' as referring to a request for the President to make the
appointment is to pick up the words of sub-paragraph
(iv) beginning `then
either valuer or either party may request ...,' and not the previous words of
that sub-paragraph.
<P>

28  	The view which I favour is supported by a number of textual
considerations.  The first is that while sub-paragraph (iii) envisages
that the
valuers will `agree upon and appoint' the umpire, sub-paragraph (iv) uses the
word `request', and therefore there is a natural
linking of the words `fresh
request' in sub-paragraph (vi) with sub-paragraph (iv).
<P>

29  	Additionally, the `fresh request' is for an `appointment', and
this implies that the request will lead to action by a person
who has a power
to make the appointment.  The only person with a power to make the appointment
unilaterally for the purposes of any
part of clause 4.3.7 is the President
under sub-paragraph (iv), whereas the valuers under sub-paragraph (iii) must
agree before the
appointment can take effect under that sub-paragraph.
<P>

30  	Although, in my view, the making of a fresh request under
sub-paragraph (vi) is to be seen as a request for the President to
appoint a
substitute umpire, it is noticeable that sub-paragraph (vi) is silent as to the
person to whom the request is to be made.
 Consistently with the wording of
sub-paragraph (vi) the request could be made directly to the President, or if
could be made to
the other party to the lease who would be able to transmit the
request to the President for action.  In either event, a document
seeking to
invoke sub-paragraph (vi) would fall within the description `a fresh request
for the appointment of a substitute umpire'.
 There is no basis for implying
additional words into the sub-paragraph requiring that the request must be made
direct to the President.
 Indeed, the normal inference, in a commercial
contract which empowers `either party' to give a notice or take some other step
involving
written communication, is that in the absence of other provisions it
is sufficient for that step to be taken by communicating with
the other party
to the contract.
<P>

31  	Counsel for the defendant resisted the view that the request for
the purposes of sub-paragraph (vi) may be made to the counterparty
to the
contract.  He contended that to be a valid request under sub-paragraph (vi) the
request must be made to the President.  He
submitted that the contrary view
requires the Court to create a procedure by implication from the clause for the
transmission of
the request from the counterparty to the President.  I
disagree.  The clause is simply silent as to the destination of the request.
What is required under the clause is only a `request', not that the appointment
be made.  If the counterparty receives the request,
then as a matter of
commercial common sense it is likely that the counterparty will transmit it to
the President for action, but
an alternative would be for the counterparty to
respond by suggesting the modification of clause 4.3.7 to permit selection of
an
umpire by agreement.  Alternatively, the requesting party may choose to
nominate an umpire when making the request, to see whether
a modifying
agreement can be reached.  All of these possibilities are within the wording of
sub-paragraph (vi) and I am not prepared
to read extra words into it to exclude
any of them.
<P>

32  	Counsel for the defendant submitted that is counter-intuitive to
interpret sub-paragraph (vi) so that a request for the appointment
may be made
to a person other than the person with power to appoint.  I disagree.  There is
nothing counter-intuitive in supposing
that the parties would have contemplated
that the fresh request be made to the counterparty.  Although one assumes that
the counterparty
would find out soon enough if the request were made direct to
the President, the making of the request direct to the counterparty
is a good
way of ensuring that the counterparty knows what is happening.  That, it seems
to me, fits with the likely commercial intention
of the parties.
<P>

33  	One has to construe the clause as it is without creating any
implications beyond what is necessary to give it commercial efficacy.
 In that
regard it is significant that the conduct which terminates the appointment of
the existing umpire is the making of the request,
rather than any action upon
the request.  That reinforces the view that the request may validly be made to
the counterparty.
<P>

<b>The Election Letter</b>
<P>

34  	Just as the lease is the commercial instrument, so the Election
Letter is a notice of a commercial kind.  It must be construed
in accordance
with the common sense canons of interpretation recently revisited by the House
of Lords in<b> </b><i>Mannai Investments Co Limited v Eagle Star Life Insurance
Co</i> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1997] UKHL 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1997%5d%20AC%20749" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1997] AC 749.</a>  Although the issue before the House of Lords was rather
different from the one to be addressed by this Court, their Lordships' approach
provides some general guidance.  Thus, Lord Hoffmann (at 780) refers with
approval to the decision of Goulding J in<b> </b><i>Carradine Properties Ltd v
Aslam</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1976%5d%201%20WLR%20442" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1976] 1 WLR 442</a>, 444.  Goulding J said the test for the validity of
a notice given under a lease was:  `Is the notice quite clear to the reasonable
tenant reading it?  Is it plain that he cannot be misled by it?'  And he went
on to say that the reasonable tenant must be taken
to know the terms of the
lease.
<P>

35  	In the present case the reasonable tenant or any commercial
reader of the Election Letter would be very clear about its meaning.
 The
plaintiffs' solicitors by that letter advised the defendant's solicitors that
their client, who was said to be acting under
clause 4.3.7(vi) of the Lease,
elected to make a `fresh request for the appointment of a substitute umpire'.

<P>

36  	I find it difficult to imagine what words might have been used
to make clearer the plaintiffs' intention to invoke sub-paragraph
(vi), and
thereby to terminate the appointment of Mr Aitken as an umpire.  The defendant
submitted that it was unclear from the letter
that its author intended to cause
Mr Aitken's appointment as umpire to cease, but the letter refers specifically
to the sub-paragraph
which causes that consequence to arise once a fresh
request is made, and signifies an election to make a fresh request.  
<P>

37  	The Election Letter goes on to propose the new umpire.  Properly
construed, that is the invitation by one party to the contract
to the other to
negotiate a variation of the existing procedure, so that an agreed umpire could
be appointed in place of the President's
nominee.  That this is so is clarified
by the third paragraph of the Election Letter, which specifically invites the
defendant to
agree to the proposed nominee, failing which a request would be
made to the President.
<P>

38  	Given the proper construction of sub-paragraph (vi), it seems to
me crystal clear that the Election Letter is a `fresh request
for the
appointment of a substitute umpire' for the purposes of that sub-paragraph.
There would obviously be some real injustice
if it were not so, given the clear
intention of the author of the Election Letter.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>

39  	My conclusion, therefore, is that the plaintiffs have
successfully invoked sub-paragraph (vi) of clause 4.3.7 by the Election
Letter
dated 12 March 1999, and consequently under that sub-paragraph Mr Aitken's
appointment as umpire ceased on that date.  He
was, therefore, not the umpire
at the time when he purported to issue his determination, namely 19 March
1999.
<P>

40  	The evidence shows that on 7 April 1998 the plaintiffs made a
request directed to the President of the Australian Institute
of Valuers, and I
am informed from the Bar table that a valuer has been subsequently appointed as
umpire.  It has not been suggested
that that appointment is defective.
<P>

<b>Costs</b>
<P>

41  	Although my construction of clause 4.3.7 does not rely on the
submissions initially made on behalf of the plaintiffs, it produces
the result
that the plaintiffs succeed on the separate question and it conforms to the
submissions ultimately made on behalf of the
plaintiffs.  Therefore, my opinion
is that costs should follow the event.
<P>

<b>Orders</b>
<P>

42  	I propose to make the following orders:
<P>

(1)	I vacate order 1 made by the Registrar on 24 August 1999 to the extent that
it purports to identify the preliminary issue for
determination.
<P>

(2)	By the consent of the parties I direct that the following question be
determined separately from any other question before the
trial of the
proceedings under Pt 31 of the Supreme Court Rules:
<P>

`Did the appointment of the umpire (R Aitken) cease prior to the umpire's
letter dated 19 March 1998?'
<P>

(3)	I answer the separate question `yes'.
<P>

(4)	I order the defendant to pay the plaintiffs' costs of the determination of
the separate question.
<P>

(5)	I stand the matter over to the Registrar's list on Thursday 11 November
1999 at 9.30am for directions as to the further determination
of the
proceedings.
