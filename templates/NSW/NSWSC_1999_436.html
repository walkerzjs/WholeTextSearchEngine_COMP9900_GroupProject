<b>JUDGMENT NO. 17</b>
<P>

<b>HIS HONOUR:</b>
<P>

1	In December 1997, conversations between the accused, Mr Sleiman and Ms
Cassar, in their flat were recorded covertly by listening
device.
Conversations on the telephone between one or other of them and some other
person were also covertly recorded.  The Crown
will tender parts of those
recorded conversations, I having excluded other parts as irrelevant or in the
exercise of my discretion.
<P>

2	The accused object to the tender of transcripts of the tapes.
<P>

3	Much of the conversations recorded by listening device is indistinct,
particularly due to background noise.  The telephone intercepts
are clear.
<P>

4	Detective Acting Sergeant McNab has given evidence on the voir dire that he
played over the listening device tapes many times
and made the transcript of
those tapes.  He said he was satisfied that the transcripts were accurate.
Some parts of the recorded
conversations have not been transcribed, being
designated "IND", for indistinct.  I take Detective Acting Sergeant McNab's
evidence
to be that he was satisfied of the accuracy of the transcripts as far
as they go.  The Crown wishes to call that evidence at the
trial.  That also is
opposed.
<P>

5	<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 48(1)</a> of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a></i> provides as follows, so far as
is relevant:
<P>

	"48(1)	A party may adduce evidence of the contents of a document in question
by tendering the document in question or by any one
or more of the following
methods:
<P>

	...
<P>

	(c)	if the document in question is an article or thing by which words are
recorded in such a way as to be capable of being reproduced
as sound, or in
which words are recorded in a code (including shorthand writing) - tendering a
document that is or purports to be
a transcript of the words."
<P>

The definition of "document" in the Act includes a record of information from
which sounds can be reproduced.
<P>

6	Before the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/" class="autolink_findacts">Evidence Act 1995</a>, the relevant law was stated in<i> Butera</i> v
<i>Director of Public Prosecutions (Vict)</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1987/58.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1987] HCA 58</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%20164%20CLR%20180" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1987) 164 CLR 180</a>, in the joint
judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan and Deane JJ.  The central concept in
<i>Butera</i> was that, when a tape is admitted into evidence, the evidence is
the sound produced when the tape is played over in Court.  Restrictions
as to
the admissibility of transcripts of what was recorded on the tape flowed from
that concept.  The Crown conceded, in the present
case, that, under
<i>Butera</i>, the transcripts of the telephone intercept conversations would
not have been admissible (because the recording of those conversations
is
distinct).  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 48(1)</a> embodies no such restricting concept.  It makes
transcripts admissible according to its terms.  A document that purports to be
a
transcript of words recorded on a tape is admissible to prove the
conversations.  
<P>

7	<i>Butera </i>(supra), <i>Menzies </i><a href="http://www.nzlii.org/nz/cases/NZCA/1982/19.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1982] NZCA 19</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1982%5d%201%20NZLR%2040" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1982] 1 NZLR 40</a> (quoted with approval
in <i>Butera</i>) and the subsequent decision of the Full Court of the Federal
Court in <i>Eastman</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281997%29%20158%20ALR%20107" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1997) 158 ALR 107</a> are valuable authority for the use
to which such a transcript may be put.  The combined effect of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 48(1)</a> and
those cases is, so far as is presently relevant, as follows:
<P>

(a)	A document that purports to be a transcript of words recorded on a tape is
admissible to prove the conversation: <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s48(1)(c)</a>;
<P>

(b)	No oral or other evidence is necessary to validate such a transcript, it
being sufficient that it purports to be a transcript
of the words:
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s48.html" class="autolink_findacts">s48(1)(c)</a>;
<P>

(c)	Where a tape is indistinct, a transcript may be used to assist the jury in
the perception and understanding of what is recorded
on the tape: <i>Butera
</i>at 187;
<P>

(d)	Where a tape is indistinct, a transcript made by an "ad hoc expert", being
a person qualified only by having listened to the
tape many times, may be used
for this purpose.  That is particularly so where the tape needs to be played
over repeatedly before
the words uttered could be made out unaided: <i>Menzies
</i>at 49 cited in <i>Butera</i> at 188;
<P>

(e)	If there is doubt or disagreement whether the transcript accurately
deciphers the sounds captured on the tape, the transcript
should be used only
as an aide-memoire.  I take that to mean that the jury is to give priority to
what they hear (or do not hear)
on the tape, if that is not consistent with
what appears in the transcript: <i>Butera</i> at 188;
<P>

(f)	The jury may have the transcript before them when this tape is played over
in court: <i>Eastman</i> at 200;
<P>

(g)	The jury should be informed, when the transcript is tendered, as to the use
which they may make of it: <i>Eastman</i> at 220;
<P>

(h)	A transcript may be rejected or its use limited pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 135</a>-<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">137</a>.
<P>

8	Applying these principles to the present case:
<P>

(1)	Detective Acting Sergeant McNab's evidence is admissible.
<P>

(2)	The transcripts are admissible.
<P>

(3)	There is no reason to reject the tender of the transcripts or to limit
their use, in whole or in part, pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s135.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss 135</a> to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s137.html" class="autolink_findacts">137</a>.
<P>

(4)	The jury may have a copy of the transcripts before them when the tapes are
played over in court.
<P>

(5)	Subject to any further submissions, the jury will be informed, when the
transcripts are tendered, as to the use to which they
may put the transcripts,
in terms of paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) above.
<P>

(6)	Counsel for the accused were invited to specify any part or parts of the
transcripts which are said to be unreliable.  They
have not done so.  If any
challenge is to be made in that regard in the course of submissions to the
jury, the challenge should be
put to Detective Acting Sergeant McNab when he is
called.  (As I understand it, there is no scope for any such challenge in
relation
to the telephone intercepts.)
