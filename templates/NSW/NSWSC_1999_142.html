<b>COMMON LAW DIVISION</b>
<P>

<b>MASTER HARRISON</b>
<P>

<b>THURSDAY, 4 MARCH 1999</b>
<P>

<b>20621/96  -  DOVADE PTY LIMITED ACN 003 832 880 &amp; 5 ORS</b>
<P>

<b>		  v  LINDSAY SHADDOCK &amp; 52 ORS</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT	(Security for costs - time for lodgement)</b>
<P>

1	<b>MASTER:</b>  By notice of motion filed 24 February 1999 the plaintiffs
seek that my orders made on 13 November 1998 be varied <i>nunc pro tunc</i> by
substituting therein for the date 18 January 1999 the following words "A date
21 days from the delivery of judgment of the Court
of Appeal in proceedings CA
No 40805 of 1995".  The plaintiffs relied on the affidavit Stephen Noss sworn
23 February 1999.  
<P>

2	By notice of motion filed 24 February 1999 the 2, 3 and 4 defendants seek an
order that the proceedings brought by the first plaintiff
be dismissed.  The 2,
3 and 4 defendants relied on the affidavit of Phillipa O'Dea sworn 22 February
1999.  By notice of motion filed
24 February 1999 the 35 to 52 defendants
(excluding the 39, 45 and 51 defendants) also seek that the proceedings brought
by the first
plaintiff be dismissed.  They relied on the affidavit of Moira
Saville sworn 23 February 1999.  
<P>

3	Orders were made that the plaintiffs were to provide security for costs to
the 2 to 4 defendants in the sum of $62,000 and provide
a further sum of
$62,000 being security for costs for 35 to 52 defendants (excluding 39, 45 and
51 defendants).  These orders should
have specifically referred to the first
plaintiff as security was only sought against it.  These orders have not been
formally entered
so I vary paras (1) and (2) of my orders made on 13 November
1998 to read "first plaintiff" instead of "plaintiff" pursuant to Part
20 r 10
of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b> (the slip rule).   Proceedings were stayed
against the defendants until the securities were  lodged.  The plaintiffs have
not lodged
securities in accordance with those orders.
<P>

4	In my judgment dated 13 November 1998 those securities were ordered to be
lodged by 18 January 1999.  The parties had agreed that
the proper form of
security was either a bank guarantee or cash lodged in the registry.  Reference
was made to the rationale requiring
a plaintiff corporation to pay security for
costs.  It is to protect the defendant from the consequences of limited
liability.  In
exercising the court's discretion its concern is to achieve a
balance between ensuring that adequate and fair protection is provided
to the
defendant and to avoid injustice to impecunious companies by unnecessarily
shutting them out or prejudicing them in the conduct
of litigation
(<b><u>Buckley v Bennell Design &amp; Constructions Pty Limited</u></b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281974%29%201%20ACLR%20301" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1974)
1 ACLR 301).</a>  In my previous judgment the comment was made that the plaintiff
had chosen not to appraise the court of its true financial position.
 It was my
view that the defendants should, while awaiting the Court of Appeal decision to
be handed down, be permitted to prepare
their cases for trial.  
<P>

5	The plaintiffs' solicitor says in his recent affidavit that he has been
instructed that the plaintiffs are unable to fund and
pay security for costs as
ordered.  He also says that the plaintiffs will be in a position, once the
outcome of the Court of Appeal
decision is handed down, to comply with this
security order.  The plaintiffs have requested an extension of time within
which to
lodge the security until 21 days after the Court of Appeal decision is
handed down.  
<P>

6	The first plaintiff and the other companies within a group of companies known
as the "Jury Group" appealed against a judgment
by Rolfe J in the  Commercial
Division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales made on 21 November 1995 in
favour of Westpac Banking
Corporation, the first plaintiff.  Bill Acceptance
Corporation (BAC) was the second plaintiff.  On 21 November 1995, Rolfe J made
orders inter alia that there be judgment for Bill Acceptance Corporation
Limited against each of the first and third to fifteenth
defendants in the sum
of $4,606,974.36 inclusive of interest to date, that there be judgment for
Westpac Banking Corporation against
each of the first and third to fifteenth
defendants in the sum of $15,352,210.12 inclusive of interest to date and that
there be
judgment for Westpac Banking Corporation against the second defendant
in the sum of $19,959,284.48. The Court of Appeal heard the
appeal in December
1998.  The appellants sought leave to amend its appeal to include various
grounds with respect to alleged apprehended
bias by the trial judge Rolfe J.
This leave was granted for the appellants to do so during the hearing of the
appeal.
<P>

7	
<P>

Subsequently Mason P requested that the parties provide submissions in relation
to the decision of <b><u>In Re Pinochet</u></b> (House of Lords, 17 December
1998) by 20 February 1999.  A copy of this decision became available on the
internet on about 15 January
1999.  The plaintiff's counsel submitted that the
making of written submissions will delay the decision of the Court of Appeal.
That
may be so, but when I determined the appropriate quantum of security and
the time by which it was to be lodged, I took into account
that the proceedings
(both before the Rolfe J and the appeal) were complex and that it may take some
time for the judgment to be
handed down (p 6).  
<P>

8	On the last occasion this matter was before the court, I was unaware that the
plaintiff had lodge $90,000 as security for costs
in the Court of Appeal
proceedings.  However, referral was made to the length of time, namely, 9 years
had elapsed since the events
occurred that gave rise to this cause of action
and to the fact that one of the defendant's witnesses has cancer.  This delay
and
any continuing delay in this matter being heard causes the defendants to
suffer presumptive prejudice - see comments of McHugh J
at p 8 in
<b><u>Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor</u></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1996/25.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1996] HCA 25</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20139%20ALR%201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1996) 139 ALR
1.</a>
<P>

9	Even if proceedings are dismissed as against the first plaintiff, they remain
on foot so far as the 2 to 6 plaintiffs are concerned.
 When I performed the
balance exercise (referred to earlier in this judgment) I decided that the
plaintiffs should lodge security
for costs in the sum of $62,000 for each group
of defendants.  This reflected the amount of costs that each group of
defendants would
incur in preparing their case for trial.  On the last occasion
the plaintiff submitted that an appropriate time to lodge the security
was 5
February 1999 whereas the defendants requested it within 14 days ie., by 25
November 1998.  They submitted that at the original
hearing they sought not to
lodge security until after the Court of Appeal judgment was handed down.  My
judgment does not record
that submission nor is it the recollection of the
other defendants.  I decided that security was required to be lodged by 18
January
1999 to allow the plaintiffs to focus on the running of their
appeal.
<P>

10	On 18 January 1999, when the plaintiff failed to lodge the security in
accordance with my orders it did not immediately move
the court to extend the
time for lodging the security but rather waited until 24 February 1999 to file
their motion. By that time
it had been put on notice that the defendants would
move to have the claim brought by Dovade Pty Limited struck out.  The evidence
relating to the plaintiffs' and in particular that of Dovade Pty Limited's
inability to pay security is unsatisfactory.  There is
a statement by the
plaintiffs' solicitor that he has been instructed that the plaintiffs have been
unable to fund and pay the security
for costs as ordered by the 13 November
1998 and that subject to the outcome of the matter of the appeal, the
plaintiffs will then
be in a position to fund and comply with the security
order.  None of the plaintiffs nor an officer having direct knowledge of the
financial position has given evidence on oath.  I had previously criticised the
plaintiffs for firstly not furnishing evidence as
to the amount of security
they thought was appropriate and secondly their failure to furnish evidence as
to the plaintiffs true financial
position.  
<P>

11	There has not been a material change in the circumstances since the original
application was heard nor has there been discovery
of new material which could
not have reasonably been put before the court on the original application - see
<b><u>Brimaud v Honeysett Instant Print Pty Limited</u></b> (NSWSC McLelland,
unreported 19 September 1988).  While balancing the interest of the first
plaintiff against those of the defendants,
I have to bear in mind that
injustice to impecunious defendants by unnecessarily shutting them out or
prejudicing them in the conduct
of litigation should be avoided.  However, I am
faced with the difficulty that once again evidence of the first plaintiff's
true
financial position has not been put before the court even though the
plaintiffs have conceded that it is appropriate that security
for costs be
given.  Nor has the first plaintiff deposed as to the attempts, if any, he has
made to comply with the court's order.
 It is my view that justice lies on the
side of the defendants.  The plaintiffs should provide security for costs prior
to the Court
of Appeal's decision being handed down.
<P>

12	The defendants have sought that the proceedings be dismissed on the basis of
Part 53 r 4 of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b> but conceded that the plaintiffs
should be allowed a further 7 days to lodge security and if this order is not
complied with they
submitted the proceedings should be dismissed.  
<P>

13	Part 53 r 4 of the <b>Supreme Court Rules</b> provides:
<P>

	<b>"Where a plaintiff fails to comply with an order under this Division, the
court may, on terms, order that the proceedings on any claims
by the plaintiff
for relief in the proceedings be dismissed.</b>
<P>

14	The defendants referred me to <b><u>Billinudgel Pastoral Co Pty Limited
&amp; Ors v Westpac Banking Corporation &amp; Ors</u></b> (Federal Court,
Cooper J, unreported 27 March 1998) Cooper J stated that:
<P>

	<b>"The court's discretion to vary an order for security made under O 28 or to
dismiss proceedings pursuant to s 56(4) for failure to
provide security or
further security is an unfettered discretion to be exercised in the
circumstances of the case.  Whilst the court
will be careful to see that orders
for security for costs to not work injustice to parties against whom the orders
are made, if those
parties do not comply with the orders and offer no
explanation for non-compliance, they cannot be hear to complain if, after a
considerable
length of time, their proceedings are dismissed:  <i>Microboi
Resources Inc v Betatene Ltd</i> (unreported, Federal Court of Australia (FC)
Black CJ, Sheppard and Einfeld JJ, 8 October 1993) at 9-10..."</b>
<P>

15	As previously stated the first plaintiff by its officers has failed to put
any evidence as to the steps it has taken to comply
with the courts orders.
However, the first plaintiff should have a further opportunity to comply with
the orders for security for
costs.  The time for lodging security is extended
for the period of 28 days from the date of this judgment.  If the orders for
security
are not complied with, the proceedings should be dismissed.
<P>

16	As the first plaintiff did not comply with the court's earlier order and was
unsuccessful in its motion it is my view that the
first plaintiff should pay
the defendants' costs of the motions.  The defendants submitted that these
costs should be payable forthwith.
 Costs should be payable in the normal
manner, that is they should be payable at the conclusion of the proceedings.
<P>

17	
<P>

The orders I make are:
<P>

(1)	Paragraphs (1) and (2) of my orders made on 13 November 1998 be varied to
read "first plaintiff" in lieu of "plaintiffs".
<P>

(2)	Paragraph (4) of my orders made on 13 November 1998 be extended to 1 April
1999.
<P>

(3)	The first plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs of these three motions,
namely the plaintiffs' motion, the 2, 3 and 4 defendants'
motion and 35 to 52
defendants' (excluding 39, 45 and 51 defendants) all filed on 24 February
1999.
<P>

(4)	The matter is stood over to the registrar's list at 9.30 am on 6 April
1999.
