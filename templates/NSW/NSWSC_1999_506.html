<b>FRIDAY 14 MAY 1999</b>

<b>5152/97 -  SERGE FEDOROVITCH &amp; ANOR V ST AUBINS PTY LTD &amp;
ANOR</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1	<b>HIS HONOUR :</b>    These proceedings are what in my young days at the Bar
were called a "backyarder" involving approximately $2,000. However, they
are in
the Supreme Court because this is the only court that can deal with this
particular type of dispute.
<P>

2	Unfortunately although only $2,000 is, in the first instance, involved, the
proceedings raise quite important issues of principle
and the result of the
proceedings will be very expensive for at least one of the parties.  There
have, I understand, been mediation
and settlement talks, but they have got
nowhere.
<P>

3	The case concerns a company title block of home units at Waverton.  The
shares in the company entitle the holders to occupation
rights of units in the
block.  That was permissible under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s195.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 195(13)</a> of the Corporations Law (now
repealed) even though it involves a reduction of capital in allowing
shareholders to have and use for
their own profit the property of the
company.
<P>

4	At present unit 1 is held by King Nest Pty Ltd, a company of which the second
defendant, R F King, is the controlling director.
 Unit 2 is held by Henrietta
Lopacinski.  Unit 3 is held by the second defendant, and unit 4 by the
plaintiffs.  Units 1, 2 and 4
are let:  Mr King lives in unit 3.  Mr King is a
professional investor, he does not go out to work but conducts his money-making
activities in his unit.  Accordingly, he is on site, not only during the night,
but also during most of the day.
<P>

5	The factual background to the present problem is that in 1994 there were a
series of incidents in and around the building.  The
then "tenant" of unit 4
was Sydney Tour Services Pty Ltd.  I put the word "tenant" in quotes because
under this sort of arrangement
probably no tenancy is created; see<b> Tittman v
Traill</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281957%29%2074%20WN%20%28NSW%29%20284" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1957) 74 WN (NSW) 284.</a> However, the parties and their associates at
all times seem to have thought that there was a tenancy, even though many of
them could
not spell the word.
<P>

6	It would now seem that part of the business of that company was to supply
Korean prostitutes to Asian tourists. There is no evidence,
however, that
anyone in the block knew of this at the time when the plaintiffs' real estate
agent, who was managing the property
for them, granted the rights to the
company.
<P>

7	On 7 July 1994 Mr Prestele, a tenant of unit 1, came into contact with two
gentlemen who appeared to be minders of the prostitutes.
 He was assaulted and
his glasses smashed.  During the same period police were called on more than
one occasion, and a gun was seized
by the police.
<P>

8	The incident upset Mr King considerably and he made contact with the first
plaintiff, Mr Fedorovitch, and also the second plaintiff.
 Mr King was quite
sure in his own mind that the plaintiffs were not doing anything to cure the
situation.  He took the view that
the plaintiffs, whose attitude was "refer the
matter to our managing agents, please" were insensitive to the problems of
other people
who were living in the building, such as Mr King and his
tenants.
<P>

9	Just what action the plaintiffs could have taken is unclear.  There was no
evidence of the lease between the plaintiffs and Sydney
Tour Services Pty Ltd,
or what action they or their managing agents in fact took.  However, it was not
until 12 October 1994 that
the troublesome tenants moved out of the
building.
<P>

10	When these events took place and Mr King formed the view that not enough was
being done, he went into great activity.  During
August and September 1994 he
took a number of steps to solve the perceived problem.  The first relevant step
which appears in the
minute book is that there was a so-called minute of a
meeting of directors held on 18 August 1994 at unit 3.  According to the
minutes
no-one was actually present at the meeting, though Mr King was in
attendance and as minuted a proxy had been received from Mr S Lesser
in favour
of Mr King.  Mr Lesser was a nominee of King Nest Pty Ltd, who it would appear
at least in 1992 may have had a general
authority to attend meetings of members
of the company and who was also a director.
<P>

11	I will refer to the Articles of Association of the company throughout the
case but at this stage it is only necessary to note
that under Article 69 two
directors were a quorum and that, of course, means two directors personally
present.  Accordingly, the
so-called meeting of directors of 18 August 1994,
which took a whole seven minutes and whose "minutes" record fifteen different
motions,
is just a complete nullity and the "minutes" can only be considered to
be a piece of paper generated by Mr King as his own aide memoir.
<P>

12	The so-called minutes suggested that legal advice and a court order be
sought, if required.  A notice of meeting is stuck in
the minute book in
respect of a directors' meeting to be held on 25 August 1994.  It is not
signed, though Article 103 requires it
to be signed, but bears the words "R F
King Chairman".  There is no evidence to suggest that Mr King was ever the
chairman of directors,
as required by Article 70.  Article 70 required the
directors at their first meeting after the yearly elections to elect a chairman
of the directors in the ensuing year.  They never did this.
<P>

13	The minute book shows that what happened was that virtually no meetings of
directors were held in the years 1984 to 1994, but
that all the business was
done at the annual general meeting and each annual general meeting elected its
own chairman.  This is one
of the few matters of which I can be certain by
reading the minute book.  Its form gives very little confidence that it is at
all
accurate.
<P>

14	After about 1992 Mr King was in fact elected as chairman of the meeting, but
he was never ever elected as chairman of directors,
though he kept signing
pieces of paper throughout this case as "Chairman".
<P>

15	Minutes of the meeting held on 25 August 1994 which are in the minute book,
show that there were in attendance Mr King and Mr
Lesser and that a motion was
put that:
<P>

"Mr and Mrs Fedorovitch, being the member entitled to occupation of Unit 4,
through the actions of their tennants, (sic) have failed
to observe the
conditions set forth in paragraphs (d), (g), (h), (i) and (j) of Article 7 of
the Articles of Association.
<P>

 2.  That Mr and Mrs Fedorovitch be called upon to remedy such breaches to the
satisfaction of the board by removal of the existing
occupants of Unit 4 within
seven (7) days, and that if such breaches are not remedied within such time,
that Messrs Spanswick &amp;
Gilchrist are directed to give notice and cause to
be convened a special general meeting of the Company to consider whether the
member
in question shall be required to cease to be a member of the
Company".
<P>

16	Another notice of meeting was given for the next day and on the next day the
minutes again record that there were present everyone
except Mr King, though Mr
Lesser was present and the minutes record that he was proxy for Mr R King.
<P>

17	The minutes also show that Mr Beatty, solicitor, was in attendance.  The
minutes record that after extensive discussion a resolution
was passed:
<P>

"That the Board obtain a written report from Mr Amery of North Sydney Council
regarding the tenants (such report already having
been requested by Mr
Fedoravitch (sic)) on the basis that if that report supports the complaints
made, Mr Fedoravitch (sic) undertakes
to instruct his agents to terminate the
lease immediately.
<P>

The retention of Mr Beatty as solicitor for the company is confirmed."
<P>

18	The activities of Mr Beatty are rather strange.  His name does not appear in
the Law Almanac of recent years, except for the
years 1994 and 1995.  He
appears to be an American lawyer who has gained qualifications in Australia. He
is either a poor typist
and does his own typing or, alternatively, has never
learned how to spell "tenant".
<P>

19	He generated a bill, which bears date 2 August 1994, for $1,000 for five
hours' work and rendered it to the company.  However,
the evidence shows that
he gave his draft costs agreement to the company only on 24 August.
<P>

20	It would appear that he was retained by Mr King.  There is nothing in the
various alleged minutes to refer to his appointment
except the minute of 26
August 1994, which is a "confirmation".  Although he was only retained on the
24th we have his bill dated
2 August, which must be wrong, as everyone
concedes, for work which appears not to have been done at that stage.
<P>

21	It would further seem that on 26 August the parties had come to a sensible
arrangement to resolve the problem, yet Mr Beatty
continued to do work, or so
he claims, and on 2 October rendered a further bill for $700, reminding the
first defendant company that
the $1,000 of 2 August had not been paid.
<P>

22	This is a very strange document because it tends to show that 2 August was
not just a typographical error, yet we know on the
evidence it could not have
been right.  Extreme doubt, accordingly, exists as to the bona fides of those
two accounts.
<P>

23	Mr King himself claimed various expenses in connection  with the occupants
of unit 4, including photocopying and use of time,
and these meant that the
total expenses of $1700 for Mr Beatty and $129 for Mr King were claimed against
the company.
<P>

24	The evidence tends to suggest that someone actually paid these bills.
However, there is no minute anywhere which gave authority
for the company's
money to be expended.  Company money cannot be expended without authority.  It
is normal for the directors who
have the control of the company under the
Articles to resolve that accounts be paid or, alternatively, to delegate that
authority
to officers of the company for bills under a certain amount.  None of
this happened.  Yet somehow or other these accounts, which
appear on the face
of them to be suspicious, and of very doubtful  benefit to the company, as
opposed to Mr King, were charged against
the company.
<P>

25	However, having generated paper that showed the company owed $1829 in
respect of the work done by Messrs Beatty and King, the
company then purported
to raise a special levy to have these sums payable only by the proprietor of
the shares relating to unit 4.
<P>

26	A piece of paper was generated by Mr King somewhere in early December 1994
purporting to be a notice of annual general meeting.
 When it was received by
Mr Fedorovitch and Mrs Lopacinski they complained that the date chosen of 27
December was a public holiday
and they would not be in the area.  Mr King
replied that the meeting had to be held that calendar year and that he would
convey their
apologies.
<P>

27	This was not good enough.  The Articles do not confer on a director, even a
person who may be the de facto chairman, the right
to choose the date of the
annual meeting.  The Articles require that the directors convene the meeting.
The directors never met to
do so.  Further, when one finds that two out of the
four directors object to the date it is quite clear that the point is not just
a technicality.
<P>

28	Company meetings cannot just be held, they have to be convened and unless a
meeting is convened by the appropriate people it
is not in law a meeting of the
company.  Moreover, it is usual practice, and a good practice, that at every
company meeting the notice
convening the meeting must be read or somebody must
move that it be taken as read.  In any event, the notice of meeting would have
to be signed under Article 103 by the person convening it, or by a director on
their behalf, and that did not happen either.
<P>

29	Up until 27 December it would seem from all the material that Mr Fedorovitch
was a director.  It was suggested that he had ceased
to be a director on that
day because he indicated a desire to resign, or had indicated that he would not
sign a consent to act.
<P>

30	At the so-called meeting of 27 December there were present Mr King and Mr
Lesser.  Mr Lesser had no right to be at that meeting
because he was not a
shareholder, other than as a representative of King Nest Pty Ltd.  He could not
have been there in that capacity
because the signed minutes say that no proxy
was received and such minutes are prima facie evidence that that is so
(Corporations
Law s 251A(6)) and, indeed, under the Articles, they are
conclusive evidence.  Accordingly, on the face of the minutes there was
no
quorum at the meeting.  Either or both because  it could not have been properly
convened or there was no quorum, the meeting was
a complete nullity.  Under
"Directors" the minutes say:
<P>

"Resolved that Messrs King and Lesser and Mrs H Lopacinski, all being eligible,
be elected as Directors.  Mr Fedorovitch had advised
that he did not seek
re-election."
<P>

31	However, as that was quite invalid, the directors presumably all ceased to
hold office.
<P>

32	There was a proposal put to the meeting that future leases to tenants should
incorporate an extra clause and that:
<P>

"There be raised a one time special levy of the amount of $1829 for expenses
incurred in relation to the tenants in Unit 4 and that
this amount be levied on
the owners of shares entitling occupancy of Unit 4 instead of this amount being
apportioned amongst all
shareholders."
<P>

33	The so-called meeting of 27 December resolved that discussion on that matter
be adjourned to 16 January 1995.  A notice was given
of that adjournment and on
16 January there was a meeting in which the minutes recorded Mr Fedorovitch,
Mrs Lopacinski, Mr Lesser
and Mr King attended.  However, as this was an
adjournment of the annual general meeting, and as the annual general meeting
had never
been properly convened, this meeting was also a nullity.
<P>

34	However, there is a cross-claim that the meeting be validated under s 1322
of the Corporations Law and one should give very serious
consideration to this
because all four units were duly represented at the meeting and intended that
what they transacted at the meeting
would not just be a solemn farce.  However
as the result of the case is the same whether the meeting was or was not valid,
there
is no need to make any order on the cross-claim.
<P>

35	There was some doubt as to whether Mr Fedorovitch attended or not.  I
consider on the evidence he did.  The minutes show that
the proposal regarding
future leases was passed unanimously, but the meeting also resolved, according
to the minutes, that the special
levy be raised in accordance with the notice.
The minutes say that Lopacinski, Lesser and King voted in favour.  Mrs
Lopacinski denied
on oath that she had ever voted in favour.  I thought that
she was a very credible witness and accepted virtually all her evidence,
but I
think in this respect she was in error and that given the political
circumstances existing at that time she did in fact support
it.  Whether she
meant to support it or not may have been another matter.
<P>

36	The question then is whether the levy was validly passed.  This leads one to
consider the terms of Article 16 of the Articles
of Association.  The Article
is as follows:
<P>

"16. Once in each half year or at such other interval as the Directors may from
time to time determine the Directors shall have
the right to make a levy on the
shareholders in the Company, provided that such levy shall not exceed the sum
required to meet all
expenses charges and outgoings set out hereunder and that
each shareholder shall only be required to contribute to such levy on the
basis
of the proportion of the number of shares held by such shareholder in the
Company at the time such levy is made to the total
number of issued shares of
the Company at that time or such other basis as the Company by ordinary
resolution from time to time may
determine:-
<P>

(Various particulars (a) to (j) were then specified and the Article
continued)
<P>

Upon any such levy being made in accordance with this Article notice in writing
shall be given to the holder of each group of shares
addressed to him at his
registered address and the amount of such levy shall become due and payable
fourteen days thereafter, and
may be recovered by action in any court of
competent jurisdiction.  Should the holder of any group of shares fail to pay
the amount
of such levy within such period of fourteen days a second notice in
writing shall be forwarded to such holder as hereinbefore provided
and unless
such holder shall pay the amount of such levy within such additional period of
fourteen days the Directors (without prejudice
to any other right that the
Company may have against the shareholder for the recovery of such levy) may
enter into possession of
the flat which the holder has the right to occupy and
receive the rents therefrom until the amount of such levy is fully satisfied.
The directors shall also have a lien upon the shares of the holder until such
levy is fully satisfied in similar manner as to the
liens attaching in case of
non-payment of calls."
<P>

37	The Article is rather hard to construe and in fact it was never observed.
The scheme is that at least every six months the directors
were to determine to
make a levy on the shareholders and unless some other basis had been laid down
by ordinary resolution the levy
was to be shared equally.
<P>

38	The minutes show that at no stage did the directors ever do this, but the
annual general meeting set the levy.  Technically,
it did not really even do
this because the method chosen was to increase or vary the amount paid in the
previous year rather than
making a fresh levy.  Probably under the <b>Duomatic
</b>principle (see <b>Re Duomatic Ltd </b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1969%5d%202%20Ch%20365" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">[1969] 2 Ch 365)</a> that levy was well
levied, though ordinarily where the Articles confer a power on directors then
the power must be exercised by the
directors and not by the company in general
meeting.
<P>

39	However, there is a long step from that argument to the argument put by Mr
Davidson, who appeared for the second defendant, that
because the company had
behaved in such a way for ten years, that it was for the general meeting to
make the levy not the directors.
<P>

40	The Articles of Association are to be the governing constitution of the
company and although people can waive rights the court
does not lightly hold
that the parties have agreed by acquiescence, even over a long period of time
or otherwise, that an informal
procedure take the place of a formal procedure.
It was for the directors to make the levy, not the general meeting, and unless
everybody
acquiesces in it the purported making of a levy by the annual general
meeting was just null and void.
<P>

41	Even if that were wrong, the true construction of Article 16 is that the
levy is to fall equally on the members, unless the company
by ordinary
resolution has determined from time to time otherwise.
<P>

42	When one looks at the penultimate paragraph of Article 16 one can see the
scheme is that the directors are to make a levy, and
as soon as they make it,
it is to be communicated  to the persons levied and they are to pay it within
fourteen days.  To my mind
this means that the company in general meeting must
make the determination as to how the levy is to be borne before the directors
pass their resolution.  As it is the directors who are to make the levy and the
company that is to set the rules, there is no room
for an eo instanter decision
or for one made afterwards.
<P>

43	It is not competent for the general meeting to both pass a resolution that
the levy be made and that it be paid by a certain
person.
<P>

44	There are other matters which could be considered, such as bad faith, et
cetera, but it is just not necessary to consider those.
<P>

45	The further costs were allegedly incurred from an additional bill from the
accountants of the company of $800. Again Mr King
thought that these should be
paid by the plaintiffs.  Those matters came to a head on 4 December 1995.  
<P>

46	There is in the minute book a piece of paper which has the date on it "23
November 1995" and which purports to convene an annual
general meeting of
shareholders to follow the directors meeting to be held at 5pm on 5 December.
Not only is it not signed, it also
does not indicate who was convening the
meeting. However, it did contain a provision that there be a resolution in
accordance with
Article 16 that the amount of $800 be levied on the plaintiffs
and that ten percent interest on outstanding levies on 16 January
1995 was to
be imposed.  For some unexplained reason the directors met on 4 December at 1pm
and simultaneously met as the annual
general meeting at the same time.
<P>

47	Mr Fedorovitch was elected as a director.  A Mr Fewings was invited to chair
the meeting.  Mr Fewings was not a director or a
member of the company, he was
an employee of the managing agents.  The proposal of the levy of $800 was put
to the meeting.  Mr King
and Mr Lesser voted in favour. Mrs Lopacinski and Mr
Fedorovitch voted against and the chairman, Mr Fewings, purported to carry the
motion on his casting vote.  This, of course, was a complete nullity so that it
does not really make much difference whether the
meeting was convened or not.
Mr Fewings never had a vote because he was never a director.  The Articles
allow the chairman of directors
on a poll to have a casting vote, but it did
not mean that a chairman who was not a director was given a vote.  In any event
there
was not a poll called for.
<P>

48	Accordingly, the levy allegedly imposed in December 1995 was also
invalid.
<P>

49	The next matter is whether in addition to making the declaration that it is
invalid, the conduct of the meeting has shown oppression
within the meaning of
s 246AA of the Corporations Law.  It is really amazing that a relatively small
though disturbing incident would
have led to the considerable amount of
activity against the plaintiffs, who after all were not guilty of anything
other than  perhaps
not activating their managing agents with sufficient force
to get rid of the occupants of their unit.  They, however, did that within
a
couple of months.
<P>

50	I think part of the problem is, as Mrs Lopacinski said in her evidence, that
Mr King has not enough to occupy  himself during
the day and allows these
trivial matters to prey upon him.  Mr Davidson in cross-examination put that
matters of guns and being assaulted
by the minders of prostitutes were not
trivial.  Mrs Lopacinski agreed with that, but said there were a number of
other matters as
well.
<P>

51	Because each shareholder in a home unit company is more concerned with his
or her own unit rather than the company as a whole,
fiduciary duties owed to
the average hypothetical member are hard to discern:  <b>Woods v Cann
</b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281963%29%2080%20WN%20%28NSW%29%201583" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1963) 80 WN (NSW) 1583.</a>  This problem does not, however, mean that the
court cannot, in an appropriate case, find that the majority have oppressed the
minority
in such a company.  Indeed the close emotional attachment to the
shareholders' place of residence that goes with their shares may
mean that it
is easier to come to the view that oppression exists.
<P>

52	In the present case, Mr King and his company control half the units.  Mrs
Lopacinski fairly said that no-one can resist Mr King
assuming the position of
chairman and as such purporting to exercise a casting vote at each meeting.
The activities of the generation
of fictitious meetings and minutes, the
circumstances of the acquisition of Mr Beatty's services and the invalid
attempt to impose
the liability for fees on to the plaintiffs, to my mind show
that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner which
is
oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to the plaintiffs.
<P>

53	Accordingly, in the circumstances, under s 246AA the plaintiffs being in the
minority, the orders sought have been made out.
 The next question is what sort
of order should be made.
<P>

54	The ordinary order in cases of this nature is that the minority sell their
shares to the majority because the minority usually
are complaining that they
have been oppressed and that they cannot extricate themselves from a corporate
structure which is not returning
them the benefit that they reasonably
expected: see<b> Fexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/413.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1998] NSWSC 413</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2028%20ACSR%20688" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1998) 28 ACSR
688.</a>
<P>

55	However, that ordinary order would to some extent really give Mr King, the
oppressor, what he wanted, that is to have Mr and
Mrs Fedorovitch get out of
the building.  On the other hand Mr and Mrs Fedorovitch have bought this unit
as an investment and provided
the price is right then they may well invest more
profitably elsewhere.
<P>

56	I have not found any case in Ms Boros' book <b>Minority Shareholders'
Remedies</b> (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995) of an order being made under s
246AA of the Corporations Law in respect of a home unit company. 
I thought for
a while that one way of dealing with the matter was to order that the sale be
at a premium, but at present it seems
to me that this is beyond the power of
the court and that one cannot order a premium unless the conduct of the
oppressor has affected
the value of the shares; see eg<b> Kizquari Pty Ltd v
Prestoo Pty Ltd</b>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2010%20ACSR%20606" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1993) 10 ACSR 606.</a>
<P>

57	It seems to me that the appropriate order in a home unit case where the
owners cannot get on together is to order that the whole
building be sold, or
that the oppressor be ordered to buy out the oppressed on the basis, if there
are four shareholders, of one-quarter
of the value of the building and land,
rather than the value of the shares which give the occupancy of that unit.
This may give rise
to capital gains tax problems or other problems.
<P>

58	There is also in the instant case the fact that Mrs Lopacinski is not a
participant to the proceedings. Ordinarily in a partnership
suit or in a
partition suit all the persons interested would have to be parties; see<b> Van
Sandau v Moore</b> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1826/1134.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1826] EngR 1134</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281826%29%201%20Russ%20441" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1826) 1 Russ 441</a>;   <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=38%20ER%20171" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">38 ER 171.</a>  However, a company suit is
well constituted the way it is.  There is some suggestion that Mrs Lopacinski
may wish to sell out anyhow,
which may remove this difficulty.  However, there
may  be capital gains tax problems which should not be visited upon the
plaintiffs
or Mrs Lopacinski.
<P>

59	Another way of dealing with the matter is to order that the capital in the
company be reduced by transferring the whole of the
property to the four owners
as tenants in common so they can then proceed under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/s66g.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 66G</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca1919141/" class="autolink_findacts">Conveyancing
Act 1919</a>.
<P>

60	As I indicated at the close of argument yesterday, I will not proceed to
make an order under s 246AA at this stage, but will
direct that the parties
exchange valuations of (a) the shares entitling occupation of unit 4; and (b)
the whole parcel of the land
and building, no later than 30 June 1999, and I
will list the matter before me on 19 July at 9.50 am for the purpose of
considering
what order needs to be made.  It will be necessary because I will
not be sitting after the end of July to conclude the matter that
week or the
week after.
<P>

61	My present feeling is that this is a matter which essentially involved
$2,000 that has got out of hand.  The costs are enormous.
 The problem has been
brought about solely by Mr King and, accordingly, the costs to date should be
paid by the second defendant
on the indemnity basis, but as I have not yet
heard counsel on that matter I will note my preliminary thoughts and they can
be debated
on 19 July 1999.  Any short minutes should note that the cross-claim
should be dismissed, with no order for costs of the cross-claim.

<P>

                                          oOo
