v
<P>

<b>John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited </b>

<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Imputations - capacity)</b>
<P>

1	HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiff has instituted proceedings against the defendant
claiming damages for defamation arising from imputations
pleaded as being
carried by an article in <i>"The Sun Herald"</i> Newspaper on 2 August 1998.
<P>

2	The article is in the following terms:
<P>

	<b><i>"Dye:  Lasix? No bleedin' way</i></b>
<P>

<i>	Whistle-blowing vet Nick Kannegieter caused yet another stir on 2KY
yesterday morning when he told Max Presnell that Australian racing
should
follow the American example and allow `bleeders' to race on the drug
Lasix.</i>
<P>

<i>	`What a complete idiot,' blasted jockey Shane Dye when given his right of
reply on air.</i>
<P>

<i>	`Has that vet ever seen what a horse that bleeds does?  They don't just
collapse from under you, they do a somersault and come down
on top of
you</i>
<P>

<i>	`You only gotta look at the incidents of the last six months to see
jockeys' lives are already at stake every time they get on board
a
horse.</i>
<P>

<i>	`Bleeders are the most dangerous horses to ride, and its just not
safe.'</i>
<P>

<i>	`I agreed,' replied Presnell".</i>
<P>

3	Three imputations are pleaded:
<P>

	<i>"(a)	that, as a veterinary surgeon, he was grossly incompetent in that he
advocated the use of Lasix on horses known to bleed;</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	that, as a veterinary surgeon, he had displayed gross ignorance in
advocating the use of Lasix on horses known to bleed;</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	that, as a veterinary surgeon, he had advocated allowing horses known
to bleed to continue racing, when to do so placed the lives
of the jockeys in
danger".</i>
<P>

4	In relation to imputation (c) there is no issue.
<P>

5	In relation to imputations (a) and (b) it is submitted, amongst other things,
that they do not differ in substance being references
to gross incompetence and
gross ignorance.
<P>

6	The determination of that legal question of compliance with the rules has
been considered recently by myself in <b><i>Haerstch v Andrews and the State of
New South Wales</i></b> (NSWSC 359, 21 April 1999) and a similar concept was
considered by Hunt J in<b> <i>Mathieson v Kennedy</i></b> (unreported, 3
November 1989).
<P>

7	The substantiality of the difference in those two cases was concerned with
incompetence and negligence.  Here we are concerned
with incompetence and
ignorance.  The holding in both of those cases that there was a sufficient
difference, even if described as
"<i>just"</i>, compels me to the view that
that submission is not available.
<P>

8	The principal submission however is that imputations (a) and (b) are
incapable of being defamatory presumably in their natural
and ordinary meaning
without the ordinary reasonable reader knowing anything about "<i>Lasix</i>".
I am of the view that the ordinary reasonable reader does not have to know
anything about "<i>Lasix"</i> in terms of the imputations as pleaded.  The
sting is the incompetence in the advocacy of its use, whatever it is, on horses
known
to bleed.
<P>

9	When one reads the matter complained of itself and particularly the bold
headline "<i>Lasix?  No bleedin' way</i>" the reader, ordinary and reasonable
and taken, presumably or for the sake of argument, not to have pharmacological
knowledge related
to the areas of veterinary science, would not need to know
what "<i>Lasix"</i> is.
<P>

10	"<i>Lasix"</i>, whatever it is, is something that is not to be prescribed to
bleeders and bleeders "<i>on Lasix</i>" are not to race by reason of the
clearly asserted danger of the bleeding horses collapsing under the jockey
resulting in the, no
doubt, danger of serious injury from the somersault
referred to.
<P>

11	The matter complained of is very short, very clear and  very disparaging,
the capturing of which disparagement depends, as I
have said, not on any
necessary knowledge in the reader of what "<i>Lasix"</i> is and the capturing
of which disparagement has successfully been made in imputations (a) and
(b).
<P>

12	Imputations (a), (b) and (c) will go to the jury.  The defendant is to pay
the plaintiff's costs.
<P>

13	By consent I make the orders and directions in the short minutes of order
initialled by me and placed with the papers today.
