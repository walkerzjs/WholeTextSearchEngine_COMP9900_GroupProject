<P>

<b>JUDGMENT (Imputations - capacity - form - difference in substance - parody -
matter for jury)</b>
<P>

1   	The plaintiff, at all material times a Senior Constable in
the New South Wales Police Service, has instituted proceedings against
the
defendant as publisher of <i>"Australian Hustler"</i>.
<P>

2   	The matter upon which the plaintiff sues is appended to the
Statement of Claim as Annexure `A'.  Appended to this judgment
are the three
pages of "<i>context</i>" including the particular segment of which the
plaintiff complains bearing the headline "<b><i>COP THIS</i></b>".
<P>

3   	The plaintiff contends that the publication sued upon
conveys of him the following imputations arising from the natural and
ordinary
meaning:
<P>

<i>"7(a)	The plaintiff was a hypocrite, in that he falsely claimed to be
distressed by his role in a fatal police wounding when in fact
he had enjoyed
killing a man.</i>
<P>

<i>(b)	The plaintiff was a danger to the community in that he was looking
forward to his next opportunity to kill someone.</i>
<P>

<i>(c)	The plaintiff was a sadistic killer".</i>
<P>

4   	Paragraph 8 of the Statement of Claim repeats the
imputations and pleads them as true innuendos.  The particularisation in
accordance with SCR Pt 67 r 12(c) is acknowledged to be deficient and will be
clarified upon the filing of any Amended Statement
of Claim in respect of which
leave might be granted (the word "<i>Ordinary"</i> should be omitted from any
such pleading).
<P>

5   	For the defendant it was argued and, in my view,
appropriately so, that this is a case in which the "<i>context</i>" is of much
importance. One way or the other, of course, the whole of the publication will
be placed before the jury.  Indeed, in
this case the context is critical to the
question of the availability of the causes of action (<b><i>A v IPEC Australia
Limited</i></b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VicRp/1973/4.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1973] VicRp 4</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281973%29%20VR%2039" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1973) VR 39</a> at 44-5;  <b><i>Ron Hodgson (Trading) Pty Limited
v Belvedere Motors (Hurstville) Pty Limited </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281971%29%201%20NSWLR%20472" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1971) 1 NSWLR 472</a> at 477
and 480;  <b><i>Gordon v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Limited
</i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281980%29%202%20NSWLR%20410" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1980) 2 NSWLR 410</a>;  further as to "<i>context"</i> see
<b><i>Charlestown &amp; Anor v News Group Newspapers Limited &amp; Anor</i></b>
<a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1995/6.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1995] UKHL 6</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%202%20AC%2065" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1995) 2 AC 65</a>, but see also <b><i>Chakravarti v Advertiser Newspapers
Limited</i></b> (1998) 72 ALJR 1085 per Kirby J at 1115).
<P>

6   	The fundamental position taken for the defendant is
irrespective of whether the imputations are pleaded as natural and ordinary
meanings or as true innuendos, the matter complained of when read in context,
is simply incapable of giving rise to any such meanings.
 The word
"<i>parody</i>" is defined in the Macquarie Dictionary relevantly as relied
upon by Mr Gray as a "<i>burlesque imitation ... (of a musical composition);  a
poor imitation, a travesty';  to imitate ... in such a way as to ridicule</i>".
Bearing in mind, it is submitted, that the imputations pleaded do not point to
"<i>ridicule</i>" but rather to "<i>serious</i>" attributes in the plaintiff
himself, there is here what is described by counsel, a "<i>preposterous
disparity between the form and style on the one hand and the subject matter on
the other"</i>, the latter being encapsulated in the thought "<i>bubble"</i> of
the plaintiff.  Indeed, it is so "<i>outrageous</i>" that no ordinary
reasonable reader would suppose it represents the real thought of the
plaintiff.  This is the more so when the
context containing particular piece is
considered, namely the four pages of what are described as "<i>ludicrous
thought processes</i>".
<P>

7   	It has been the experience of the Court that it is
difficult not only to identify but certainly to plead cases of ridicule
or to
plead those cases that reflect the famous dictum "<i>if a man in jest conveys a
serious imputation he jests in peril</i>" and "<i>the principle is clear that a
person shall not be allowed to murder another's reputation in jest</i>"
(<b><i>Donoghue v Hayes </i></b>(1831) IR Ex Ch 265 at 266;  <b><i>Scali v John
Fairfax Group Pty Limited </i></b>(Levine J, unreported, 15 April &amp; 15 July
1993); <b><i>Moham-Wild v John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited </i></b>(Levine
J, unreported, 8 August 1997);  <b><i>Darbyshir v Daily Examiner Pty Limited
</i></b>(Levine J, unreported, 29 August 1997)).
<P>

8   	Ms Gibson for the plaintiff in answer to the general
approach adopted by Mr Gray took up the notion of "<i>parody</i>" and made what
I consider to be the well put submission that the whole point in relation to
the publication of the plaintiff or indeed,
any of the others in the
"<i>context</i>", is that the people are in fact what they pretend not to be.
The snide insinuation, as-it-were, is that it is a joke to suggest
that the
person would not enjoy emptying his service revolver into another, but
"<i>really"</i> he would.  I think the balance between the competing
submissions is such that, upon the curing of the defects in the imputations,
the matter should go to the jury.  It is close to a borderline case as quite
many of these are, but I am not persuaded that the matter
complained of is
incapable of conveying any defamatory and disparaging sting of the plaintiff.
Certainly I appreciate the position
of the defendant that it could be argued
that the publication is "<i>cruel</i>" or <i>"insensitive",</i> but it does not
necessarily follow that it is not defamatory.
<P>

9   	In relation to imputation 7(a) this is incapable of being
conveyed as a natural and ordinary meaning.  There is absolutely
no suggestion
in the matter complained of itself that the plaintiff had in fact shot someone
in the course of duty and had been deeply
troubled by it (to put it shortly).
During the course of submissions reference was made to an imputation possibly
in the form (though
it will be a matter for the pleader), "<i>that the
plaintiff was a hypocrite in that he falsely asserts sensitivity to killing
someone when in fact he would enjoy emptying
his magazine into a
person"</i>.
<P>

10   	A supplementary submission advanced for the defendant is
that there is no difference in substance between the imputations
pleaded in
7(b) and 7(c) and 8(b) and 8(c).  In my view, that clearly is right:  to look
forward to an opportunity to kill someone,
on any reasonable basis, must
reflect that component of pleasure that is incorporated in the notion of being
a "<i>sadistic killer</i>".
<P>

11   	I would rank this matter with <b><i>Darbyshir</i></b> and
<b><i>Moham-Wild</i></b> as an extraordinary case.  I would consider it, on the
assumption that the imputations and particulars are tidied up in the Amended
Statement of Claim, to be a borderline case but one nonetheless eminently
suitable for the prompt determination by a jury.
<P>

12   	The formal orders, made in respect of the Statement of
Claim filed on 8 January 1999, are:
<P>

(a)	Imputation 7(a) is incapable of arising as a natural and ordinary meaning
and will not go to the jury.
<P>

(b)	Imputation 7(b) and (c) are struck out as not differing in substance.
<P>

(c)	Imputation 8(a) will go to the jury only as a true innuendo.
<P>

(d)	Imputation 8(b) and (c) are struck out as not differing in substance.
<P>

(e)	Costs reserved to next Directions Hearing.
<P>

(f)	The plaintiff has leave to file an Amended Statement of Claim within 14
days.
<P>

(g)	The Defence is to be filed within 14 days thereafter.
<P>

(h)	At the expiry of 28 days liberty to restore to the Defamation List on 7
days notice.
<P>
