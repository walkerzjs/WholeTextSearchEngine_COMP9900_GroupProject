<P>

<b>JUDGMENT  (Identification - true innuendos - imputations - capacity -
form)</b>
<P>

1	The plaintiffs, by a Statement of Claim filed on 5 September 1997, instituted
proceedings claiming damages for defamation arising
from a publication on 4 May
1997 in <i>"The Sun Herald</i>" newspaper.  The text of the publication is set
out as follows:
<P>

	<i>"Being a Hero costs $150,000</i>
<P>

<i>	[picture]</i>
<P>

<i>	WHISTLEBLOWER:  Elizabeth O'Brien lobbied on lead</i>
<P>

<i>	It cost Elizabeth O'Brien more than $150,000 in lost wages when she blew
the whistle on the lead industry.</i>
<P>

<i>	She forfeited four years of wages as a primary school teacher to take up a
full-time campaign to raise community awareness about
the dangers of lead
poisoning to children's health and IQs.</i>
<P>

<i>	After buying a house in Summer Hill seven years ago, Ms O'Brien became a
local hero when she discovered a lead factory across the
road was poisoning
children.</i>
<P>

<i>	She established a community action group, the LEAD Group, and lobbied the
Government to undertake a blood test survey in the Summer
Hill area around the
Thomas Thoms lead foundry.  The survey found half the pre-schoolers in the area
were poisoned by lead.</i>
<P>

<i>	Her lobbying also played a role in reducing lead levels in petrol.</i>
<P>

<i>	Ms O'Brien features in a new book, Whistleblowers, by journalist Quentin
Dempster, to be released this week.</i>
<P>

<i>	Dempster, presenter of the ABC TV's Stateline in NSW and correspondent for
the 7.30 Report has profiled 10 Australians who have taken
on the establishment
to reveal the truth about corrupt practices and cover-ups in business,
government, science and medicine.  </i>
<P>

<i>	Ms O'Brien's campaign led Thomas Thoms to shift its foundry to an
industrial estate in Queensland.</i>
<P>

<i>	Last year the LEAD Group became the NSW Community Lead Advisory Service,
where Ms O'Brien is now employed.</i>
<P>

<i>	She said she had argued with Dempster about her description as a
whistleblower.</i>
<P>

<i>	`I thought that whistleblowers were people in danger of losing their jobs,
but Quentin insisted that I was a whistleblower because
I had drawn attention
to the problem' she said.</i>
<P>

<i>	The book includes Bill Bolitho, of Victoria, the former Chairman of ANL who
exposed its wrecking by political and bureaucratic incompetence".</i>
<P>

2	It is contended that the publication conveys, of the first plaintiff (Paul
Thoms), the following imputations:
<P>

	"<i>3(a)	The first plaintiff was poisoning children.</i>
<P>

	<i>(b)	The first plaintiff's management of the Thomas Thomas </i>(sic) <i>lead
factory caused it to poison half the pre-schoolers in the Summer Hill area,
causing damage to their health and IQs.</i>
<P>

	<i>(c)	The first plaintiff was obliged to shift his business to an industrial
estate in Queensland when his corrupt practices were revealed
by a woman who
blew the whistle on the lead industry at a cost to herself of
$150,000.00".</i>
<P>

3	It is further contended that the publication conveys the following
imputations of the corporate plaintiff (Thomas Thoms Pty Limited),
as
follows:
<P>

	<i>"4(a)	The company was poisoning children.</i>
<P>

<i>	(b)	The company's lead factory poisoned half the pre-schoolers in the
Summer Hill area, causing damage to their health and IQs.</i>
<P>

<i>	(c)	The company was obliged to shift its foundry to an industrial estate in
Queensland when its corrupt practices were revealed by
a woman who blew the
whistle on the lead industry at a cost to herself of $150,000.00".</i>
<P>

4	In a general sense objection is taken to the pleading in paragraph 1 of the
Statement of Claim of immaterial averments.  That
paragraph is in the following
terms:
<P>

	<i>"The first plaintiff is the Chairman of the Second plaintiff, a corporation
which has been in business at Summer Hill, Sydney in the
State of New South
Wales since its founding in 1881 by Thomas Thoms.  At all relevant times since
1881 the business in question has
been controlled and managed by the Thoms
family".</i>
<P>

5	A reading of paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of the Statement of Claim seems to expose
the truly material averment, namely, publication
"<i>of and concerning the
plaintiffs"</i>.
<P>

6	The first plaintiff is not named in the matter complained of insofar as there
is no reference to <i>"Paul Thoms</i>".  The plaintiff is therefore obliged to
particularise the relevant facts known to persons who read the matter
complained of which
would enable such persons to give evidence of publication
"<i>of and concerning</i>" Mr Paul Thoms.  The particulars of identification
appended to the pleading merely repeat the contents of paragraph 1 of the
Statement
of Claim alleging that those matters are known to customers of
"<i>Thomas Thomas Company"</i> (sic), the first plaintiff's relatives and
friends and residents in the Summer Hill area.  It is contended that the
relationship
between the first plaintiff and the corporation bearing "<i>his
family name</i>" is a "<i>notorious</i>" fact, but not to readers of the matter
complained of but readers to the book "<i>Whistleblowers</i>" in which it is
said the first plaintiff is named and also to members of government regulatory
bodies with duties to supervise emissions
from the plaintiff's factory
premises.
<P>

7	The point is well taken as to the insufficiency of the setting out in the
Statement of Claim of particulars of relevant facts
and matters in support of
the allegation of publication "<i>of and concerning</i>" the unnamed plaintiff:
that is, particulars of identification.  
<P>

8	Paragraph 1 in the Statement of Claim, in my view, is technically
embarrassing and is amenable to being struck out for that reason.
 Proper
particulars of identification can, with facility, be provided in the usual form
as particulars appended to the Statement
of Claim in which otherwise the
relevant material allegations are averred.
<P>

9	Turning to imputation 3(a), complaint is made that it is incapable of arising
without being supported by particulars of identification
to which I have just
referred and particulars of extrinsic facts going to the history, chronology,
relationship and role of the first
plaintiff in connection with the business,
which would permit a person knowing those facts to understand the matter
complained of
as conveying that meaning.
<P>

10	In any event, it is contended (assuming particulars are available both as to
identification<i> </i>and "<i>meaning</i>"), the article is incapable of
conveying an imputation in the form of 3(a), in any event.  It is said that the
words "<i>poisoning children</i>" are emotive:  that they certainly are, but
that does not preclude their being capable of being conveyed.  The real point
is whether
the ordinary reasonable reader of this article (and the jury), would
have any difficulty in understanding whether the poisoning was
by negligence or
deliberate.  To my mind it is clear that the ordinary reasonable reader who
would come to the view that the first
plaintiff was "<i>deliberately"</i>
poisoning children would not, in reality, be a "<i>reasonable</i>" reader.  The
matter complained of is capable of pointing to some aspect of the conduct of
the first plaintiff (assuming identification),
in relation to the conduct of
the business with which he is associated and asserts the bringing about of the
poisoning of children.
 
<P>

11	The submissions for the defendant in relation to imputation 3(a) are well
founded and it will not go to the jury.
<P>

12	As to imputation 3(b) (subject to identification), it is incapable of
arising, firstly (on a minor matter), in that the matter
complained of refers
to the area "<i>around the Thomas Thoms lead foundry</i>" as opposed to the
<i>"Summer Hill area</i>".  This is so.  In addition to the submissions in
relation to the particularisation of identification, it is argued that there is
nothing in the article which is capable of conveying of the first plaintiff
anything in relation to his having managed badly or otherwise
the factory and
caused it to poison the pre-schoolers in the relevant area.  The imputation is
bad in form, in my view, in that it
does not identify with precision what it
was about the plaintiff's <i>"management</i>" that caused the lead factory to
poison the children.  Imputation 3(b) will be struck out.
<P>

13	As to imputation 3(c), subject to proper particularisation of identification
and, in my view, the prudent particularisation of
a cause of action based upon
a true innuendo, an imputation in this form is clearly capable of arising.
This is a very good example
of the use of the word "<i>corrupt</i>" in the
matter complained of to which the pleader can give no greater meaning than that
which appears in the publication itself (see
<b><i>Drummoyne Municipal Council
v Australian Broadcasting Corporation </i></b> <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2021%20NSWLR%20135" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 21 NSWLR 135</a><i>)</i>.  The
defendant used the word starkly and so may the plaintiff.  Imputation 3(c) will
go to the jury.
<P>

14	With respect to, the imputations pleaded in paragraphs 4:  imputation 4(a)
will not go to the jury and imputation 4(b), in my
view, is incapable of
arising in so stark a form and is defective in form.  There must be specified,
in my view, in the imputations
some aspects of the companies conduct of the
lead factory business that brought about the result referred to.
<P>

15	Imputation 4(c) will go to the jury.
<P>

16	Accordingly, the formal orders are:
<P>

1.	Imputations 3(a) and 4(a) will not go to the jury
<P>

2.	Imputation 3(b) and 4(b) will be struck out.
<P>

3.	Imputations 3(c) and 4(c) will go to the jury.
<P>

4.	The plaintiffs are to pay the defendant's costs.
<P>

5.	The plaintiffs have leave to file an Amended Statement of Claim within 14
days.
<P>

6.	Thereafter, liberty to restore to the Defamation List on 3 days notice.
