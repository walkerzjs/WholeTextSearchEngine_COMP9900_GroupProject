<i>Friday, 23 April 1999</i>
<P>

<b>3959/97	WAYNE LANCE FARLEY   -v-   JEANETTE BERTHA FARLEY (ESTATE OF THE
LATE LANCE ROBERTSON FARLEY)</b>
<P>

<b>4021/97	JEANETTE BERTHA FARLEY - ESTATE OF LANCE ROBERTSON FARLEY   -v-
WAYNE LANCE FARLEY</b>
<P>

<b>JUDGMENT</b>
<P>

1   	<b>MASTER:   </b>I delivered my reserved judgment herein on
14 April 1999.  In that judgment I said that I have not heard any submissions
as to costs
and that the parties should have the opportunity to be heard
concerning costs, in particular whether the costs of Jeanette Bertha
Farley (to
whom I referred in my judgment as "the defendant") should be paid by Wayne
Lance Farley (to whom I referred in that judgment
as "the plaintiff").
<P>

2   	The parties arranged for the matter to be listed before me
this day for the purpose of argument as to costs.
<P>

3   	Mr Armfield of Counsel, for the defendant, sought an order
that the costs which in my reserved judgment I proposed, subject
to any
argument and submissions by the parties, should be paid by the plaintiff to the
defendant should be paid on the indemnity
basis. Mr Bernie of Counsel, for the
plaintiff, made an application that there should be no order as to costs, to
the intent that
each party should bear his, or her, own costs of the
proceedings.
<P>

4   	In support of the defendant's application that costs should
be paid by the plaintiff on the indemnity basis there was tendered
in evidence
a letter dated 27 November 1998 from the solicitors for the defendant to the
solicitors for the plaintiff, being of the
category described as a Calderbank
letter.  The solicitors for the plaintiff did not respond to the proposals set
forth in that letter.
<P>

5   	On behalf of the plaintiff, however, in resisting the
application that the costs should be on the indemnity basis, it was submitted,
firstly, that in proceedings under the<b> </b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>, and
its statutory predecessor, the<b> </b><i>Testator's Family Maintenance and
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/goia1916231/" class="autolink_findacts">Guardianship of Infants Act </i>1916</a>, there is a very considerable
discretionary element in relation to orders in respect to costs. The
significance of that discretionary
element, so it was submitted is to remove
what might otherwise, in other kinds of proceedings (for example, in
proceedings grounded
upon contract or tort), the almost automatic consequence
in respect to costs of the failure to respond to, or to accept, an offer
contained in a Calderbank letter, where, as here, the ultimate substantive
order made upon the application of the plaintiff is significantly
worse than he
would have received if he had  accepted the offer contained in the Calderbank
letter.
<P>

6   	It has further been submitted on behalf of the plaintiff
that the consequences of the intestacy of the deceased and the practical
result
of the distribution of the estate upon intestacy in the light of the provisions
of section 61 D of the <i>Wills, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/paaa1898259/" class="autolink_findacts">Probate and Administration Act </i>1898</a>, and
the Fourth Schedule to that Act, made it inevitable that in this case the
defendant widow would, of necessity, need to institute
proceedings under the<b>
</b><i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a></i>. Further, that the plaintiff was entitled to
defend those proceedings and to uphold the form of distribution upon intestacy
provided
for by that statute.
<P>

7   	As I observed in my judgment, the claim of the plaintiff
was not without merit.  The problem confronting the Court was what
might be
described as the lack of assets in the estate available to meet any order for
provision to which, firstly, the defendant
must inevitably have been entitled
in respect to her accommodation, and to which, (subject to what I held to be
the higher claim
of the defendant) the plaintiff might ultimately have
established an entitlement.  In my judgment I observed that even though, had
the estate been larger, it might be that the plaintiff could have established
entitlement to an order for provision equal to, or
even exceeding the amount to
which he would have been entitled upon intestacy, I was satisfied that the
claim of the defendant widow
of the deceased was a claim of a higher order than
that of the plaintiff.
<P>

8   	Whilst I appreciate that the failure of the plaintiff to
respond in any way to the alternative offers contained in the Calderbank
letter
is a matter of relevance to the present application of the defendant that her
costs be paid on the indemnity basis, I do not
consider that the Calderbank
letter and the failure of the plaintiff to accept one, or other, of the offers
contained therein are
determinative of the question of whether the defendant is
entitled to have her costs paid on the indemnity basis rather than on the
party
and party basis. It would have been necessary, in any event, for the defendant
to have instituted proceedings to enforce her
entitlement to retain the house
property. The plaintiff's claim was not without merit. The problem was the lack
of any assets to
meet such a claim in the light of the higher claim by the
defendant widow.
<P>

9   	Further, it should not be overlooked that under the rules
of distribution upon intestacy the plaintiff was entitled to a significant
part
of the estate.
<P>

10   	In all those circumstances, I consider that it is not
appropriate that the defendant should have her costs on the indemnity
basis,
but that any costs to which the defendant is entitled to be paid by the
plaintiff should be paid on the party and party basis.
<P>

11   	Whilst it can be appreciated that the various factors to
which I have just referred relative to the application of the defendant
are
also relevant to the application of the plaintiff that there should be no order
as to costs, nevertheless, it will be appreciated
that, were the defendant
widow required to bear her own costs of the proceedings, then the benefit to
which, in my conclusion, the
widow was entitled from the estate of the deceased
would be  significantly eroded by her having to meet her own costs.  An order
of the nature which the plaintiff submits should be made (that is, that each
party should bear his, or her, own costs of their proceedings)
would thus
significantly reduce the benefit to which, in my judgment, the defendant has
established an entitlement.  Accordingly,
I do not propose to accede to the
application of the plaintiff that there should be no order as to costs.
<P>

12   	The costs order which I propose to make is that
foreshadowed in my judgment, being that, in proceedings 3959 of 1997, Wayne
Lance Farley v Jeanette Bertha Farley, the plaintiff shall pay the costs of the
defendant; and in proceedings 4021 of 1997, Jeanette
Bertha Farley v Wayne
Lance Farley, the defendant shall pay the costs of the plaintiff. In each case
the costs will be on the party
and party basis.
<P>

13   	The orders which I make are as follows:
<P>

1.	I make orders as set forth in my judgment of 14 April 1999 adding to order 2
in each proceedings the words "such costs to be
on the party and party
basis".
<P>

2.	I make no order in respect to the costs of today's applications, to the
intent that each party will bear his, or her, own costs
thereof.
