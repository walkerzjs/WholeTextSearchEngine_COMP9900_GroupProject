<b>4234/97  -  DAWN BOOTH &amp; ORS   v   KEITH EDWARD EVANS - ESTATE OF ALFRED
JOHN EVANS &amp; ANOR</b>
<P>

	JUDGMENT
<P>

1   	MASTER:  This is an application under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision
Act</a> in respect of the Estate of the late Alfred John Evans who died on 30 May
1997 aged eighty-nine years.  The deceased was survived
by his widow, Hilda
Vernie Evans and four of his children.  The children are the plaintiffs and the
first defendant in proceedings
4234/97.  
<P>

2   		One child, Laurie Evans, pre-deceased the testator leaving
his children, Donna Evans and Bernard Evans who survived the deceased
and they
are over eighteen years of age.  Donna and Bernard are the plaintiffs in
proceedings No.1404 of 1998.  
<P>

3   		Those proceedings have been settled upon terms that in
lieu of the provisions for them in pars.4(e) and 4(f) of the will,
the
plaintiffs shall receive jointly the sum of $15,000 between them.
<P>

4   		The deceased's will was made 27 August 1987.  Under that
will he appointed the first defendant, his son and Michael John Royle
as
executors.  Clause 3 provides that the whole of the estate be held upon trust
for his wife during her lifetime.  Clause 3(a) proceeds
to give the matrimonial
home and the rural property known as "Dawnleigh" of Goulburn Road, Oberon to
his wife for life and the remainder
to his son Keith Edward Evans who is the
executor.  There are provisions for termination of that life interest in the
property, one
of which is the wife ceasing to live permanently on the property.
That event has happened in circumstances to which I will refer
later.  
<P>

5   		Under cl.3(b) the widow was to receive all income earned
from the property including real estate, shares and investments.
 Clause 4
contains a remainder provision which operates upon the death of the deceased's
widow.  Under those provisions the plaintiff,
John Henry Evans obtains a legacy
of $10,000, shareholdings in Panfida Foods Limited and Banana Growers
Distributors Ltd and a coin
collection and a motor vehicle.  In round terms,
given the nature of the assets, that is a bequest of an approximate total of
$20,000.
 In cl.4(b) the plaintiff Beulah Royle received a sum of $35,000.  In
cl.4(c) the plaintiff Dawn Booth received $35,000.  Under cl.4(d)
the
daughters, Dawn Booth and Beulah Royle received all the furniture except one
specific item which goes to Keith Evans.   In cll.4(e)
and 4(f) each of the
grandchildren received $5,000 each.  However that has now been substituted as a
result of the settlement.  Under
clause 4(g) the residue of the estate goes to
the first defendant, Keith Evans.  There is provision in clause 5 for
investment. 
In that clause there is power to invest in non-income producing
assets including property for the occupation and use of a beneficiary.
<P>

6   		The estate consists of the property to which I have
referred which is on the road between Goulburn and Oberon and there is
evidence
of the value of that property.  If sold in one lot it would probably achieve a
sum in the order of $425,000 less selling
expenses.  There are proposals which
will allow the sub-division of different blocks some of which have separate
titles.  If these
proposals were adopted the sale price would be in the order
of $560,000.  However such a proposal is entirely dependent upon council
approval and the evidence before me does not allow me to determine that this is
likely to be the ultimate outcome.  
<P>

7   	Accordingly I will proceed on the basis that the property
is valued at $425,000.  There is cash held in the estate in the solicitor's
trust account and in the Savings Bank totalling $165,925.31.   The legal
expenses for the costs of administration have all been paid,
however, there are
the outstanding costs of this application.  The defendants' costs are estimated
at $23,000 and those of the plaintiffs
to date are $31,858.10.  This is a total
of $54,858.10.
<P>

8   		It can be seen therefore that if those costs come out of
the estate then the distributable estate would be the land and a
sum of about
$110,000.
<P>

9   		The history of the family is not set out in any great
detail but it seems that the deceased and his wife moved to the property
at
Oberon very soon after the birth of the first of their children.  John Evans
was born on 14 September 1927, Beulah Royle was born
on 3 March 1930, Dawn
Booth was born on 25 December 1933 and Keith Evans was born on 8 April 1936.

<P>

10   		During the wartime the deceased was away serving in the
Armed Forces and all the children helped on the farm as they grew
up.
Certainly it sounds as though it was not an easy life and no doubt it was
difficult for the deceased's widow managing the property
with six small
children during the period of the war.   By 1965 the deceased and his wife went
to England for a trip.  Apparently
they were away for about seven months.
During this period the first defendant, Keith, looked after the property and
spent time residing
there with his family as well as living at his home in
Oberon.   
<P>

11   		During that time the two daughters, Beulah and Dawn
painted the outside of the house of the deceased.  In 1983 the deceased
had a
tractor accident and as a result of those injuries he required a lot of care
from his two daughters.  It also meant that he
was not in a position to run the
farm thereafter.
<P>

12   		Accordingly in 1983 a lease was entered into for a period
of five years in which the farm was leased to Keith and his son
Shane.  The
lease document required that the property be kept up and that the rental was to
be amount equivalent to all the rates
and charges payable in respect of the
property.  In fact an agreement was reached outside the terms of the written
lease for the
first defendant Keith to pay $3,000 plus the rates to his father.

<P>

13   		Shortly after this in 1984 the son, Laurie Evans died and
the will was made on 27 August 1987.  In 1988 the lease of the
farm expired and
arrangements were made for its renewal on an annual basis.  From that time on
the first defendant paid $6,000 together
with the Pastures Protection Board
rates.  
<P>

14   		However, the deceased paid the council rates and claimed
those as deductions.  By February 1997 the deceased and his widow
could no
longer cope at home and they moved to Hathaway Cottage in Oberon.  I will come
back to the nature of that accommodation
later.
<P>

15   		On 30 May 1997 the deceased died.  In applications under
the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/" class="autolink_findacts">Family Provision Act</a> the High Court as recently in <b>Singer  v
Berghouse</b> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/40.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1994] HCA 40</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%20181%20CLR%20201" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1994) 181 CLR 201</a> set out the two-stage approach that a court
must take.  At p.209 it said the following:
<P>

"The first question is, was the provision (if any) made for the applicant
'inadequate for (his or her) proper maintenance, education
and advancement of
life'?  The difference between 'adequate' and 'proper' and the
interrelationship which exists between 'adequate
provision' and 'proper
maintenance' etc were explained in <b>Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited.</b>
 The determination of the first stage in the two-stage process calls for an
assessment of whether the provision (if any) made was
inadequate or what, in
all the circumstances, was the proper level of maintenance etc appropriate for
the applicant having regard,
amongst other things, to the applicant's financial
position, the size and nature of the deceased' estate, the totality of the
relationship
between the applicant and the deceased, and the relationship
between the deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims upon
his or
her bounty.
<P>

The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves similar
considerations.  Indeed, in the first stage of the process,
the court may need
to arrive at an assessment of what is the proper level of maintenance and what
is adequate provision, in which
event, if it becomes necessary to embark upon
the second state of the process, that assessment will largely determine the
order which
should be made in favour or the applicant.  In saying that, we are
mindful that there may be some circumstances in which a court
could refuse to
make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to have been left
without adequate provision for proper
maintenance. Take, for example, a case
like <b>Ellis  v  Leeder</b>  where there were no assets from which an order
could reasonably be made and making an order could disturb the testator's
arrangements
to pay creditors."
<P>

16   		As indicated by the High Court it is necessary for me to
consider the position of the plaintiffs.  I will firstly deal with
the position
of the plaintiff, John Evans who is sometimes referred in the evidence as Jack
Evans.  He is now seventy-one years of
age.  He is married and he does not have
any dependants.  He lives with his wife at 31 Skyline Avenue, Gorakan and that
property
has an estimated value of $150,000.  He has furniture and chattels
worth $10,000.  He has a Ford Fairlane, a 1976 model worth $1200
and a small
amount of cash.  Unfortunately he has a number of liabilities.  These were to
the credit union for $23,995 and to CitiBank
in the amount of $5,422 and rates
outstanding of $1,000.  He and his wife live on a pension.  Their combined
income per week is $301.50.
 He also obtains casual employment earning him
about $80 per week.  Those funds are expended entirely on their living expenses
and
clearly they only just make ends meet.  
<P>

17   		In 1980 Mr Evans had an accident at work when he fell off
the top of a truck.  He damaged his heel and his hips.  He received
a pay-out
and that has been applied in various ways.  His injuries to his heel still give
him problems and cause him difficulty with
walking.  He has got over the
problems with his hips and other than this, his only other problem of a medical
nature is that he suffers
from diabetes which he is able to control with oral
medication.
<P>

18   		It is necessary to look at his relationship with the
deceased.  He, like his brothers and sisters, worked hard for the father
and
the family.  As the children grew up it was necessary for them to work on the
farm.  There was cropping and growing of vegetables
as well as grazing.  After
he grew up there was a period when there was a mail run which he operated with
his father. Apparently
his father had purchased a truck and had the contract.
This venture was persisted in for some time but it was uneconomical and the
plaintiff, John, then left the family home and moved to Oberon.   
<P>

19   		He married and set up in Oberon after having lived for
some time with his wife on the family farm.  For a number of years
he worked as
a shearer, however, eventually in 1965 he gave up shearing and he took up being
a transport driver until the injuries
to which I have referred.  Subsequently
has obtained employment as a taxi driver.   
<P>

20   		Initially, after leaving Oberon he lived in Blayney and
then at Bathurst.  He did from time to time visit his father but
the extent of
that is probably not near as great a contact as that of the first defendant for
reasons that I will go into in due
course.  However, there is nothing to
suggest that he was not a dutiful son.
<P>

21   		One of the matters which the court has to consider in
this matter is the way in which each of the plaintiffs has been left
without
adequate and proper provision for their maintenance, education and advancement
in life.  It is important that the parties
realise that the jurisdiction which
the Court exercises under this Act is not a jurisdiction which allows the Court
to make what
one could describe as a fair distribution or some such similar
expression.   
<P>

22   		The Court's powers are simply limited to providing for
someone who can demonstrate that they have been left without appropriate
provision.
<P>

23   		In the present case the matters that have been advanced
on behalf of the plaintiff, John, are the fact that he has a number
of loans
outstanding and also that he has health problems.  He will receive
approximately $20,000 under the will and it is suggested
that in addition he
should receive some $40,000 to $50,000 over and above that provision.  How that
is arrived at simply does not
appear in the evidence.  However, certainly he
being on a pension and not being able to work, apart from some odd casual work,
has
no opportunity to earn funds to pay the loans.  Clearly he has a relevant
need.  Obviously he may have difficulty with some of his
health matters later
and so there is some need which he has demonstrated in relation to that
matter.
<P>

24   		I turn now to the situation of the plaintiff, Beulah
Royle. She is sixty-nine years of age. She is married and has no dependants.
She is in reasonably good health.  Her husband has apparently some problems
with cataracts and might need operations and he also
has problems with his back
and neck. They do not have any hospital cover.  
<P>

25   		The situation of herself and her husband is reasonably
comfortable in contrast with her brothers and sisters.  They have
a residence
in Toukley which is worth $160,000.  They have a block of land at Wyongah
nearby which is worth $80,000.  They have funds
in the name of the plaintiff of
some $60,000.  They have small amounts in the bank and a car worth $12,000 and
furniture worth $10,000.
 They have no liabilities and their income once again
is from the pension.  With interest and the pension they receive about $351
a
week which is expended on their living expenses.  
<P>

26   		Her situation was like the other children as she grew up.
She did things such as picking peas for which she was paid ten
cents a bushel
and she helped with other matters such as digging potatoes, trapping rabbits
and other things which are common to
children who grow up in that situation.
Her schooling was not a matter which was at the forefront.  She did not go to
school until
she was eight years of age and it was difficult to get to school.
At times she would have to stop away from school to help on the
farm.   
<P>

27   		However, notwithstanding this she did manage to continue
to the intermediate certificate and in due course to the leaving
certificate.
She married when she was twenty years of age. She moved to Sydney for a short
few years and back to Oberon for a few
years.  In 1954 or 1955 she moved to the
Central Coast where she has lived ever since.  
<P>

28   		She continued to visit once she obtained a driving
licence. She would bring the children home to Oberon during the school
holidays.  She also, together with her sister in 1983, spend considerable time
at Oberon looking after their parents after the tractor
accident.  They were
engaged from February to August on these matters.
<P>

29   		Apart from these there were other periods when the
deceased had a hernia operation when the plaintiff looked after him. 
Similarly
he required care when the deceased's widow also had operations at different
times.  
<P>

30   		Another occasion was when the deceased's wife broke her
arm and she once again looked after her parents.
<P>

31   	       When one turns to consider the way in which she
might have been left without adequate provision I am reminded by what
was said
by Sheller JA in the Court of Appeal in <b>Singer  v  Berghouse</b> on 23 July
1992.  There his Honour had the following to say: 
<P>

"Sheller JA (Cripps JA agreeing) said: 'I must say that I find it extraordinary
that the appellant presented scant or no evidence
as to her present income and
outgoings or as to her intentions or needs for the future or as to what lump
sum provision applying
appropriate discount tables would be required to meet
these claims or needs, if they existed.  In my opinion, in the circumstances
of
this case, for the court, in the absence of any such evidence, to make an order
for the payment to the appellant of a lump sum
is to do no more than act on
speculation and, contrary to the prohibition contained in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/fpa209/s9.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.9(2)</a> of the Act, to
alter the deceased's disposition of his property in the absence of proof that
he has inadequately provided for the
appellant'."
<P>

32   		In this case this particular plaintiff advances no
particular needs in her affidavit evidence to suggest that she has been
left
without provision.  I do note that apart from her home that she and her husband
have a block of land and $60,000 in the plaintiff's
name.  They have a fund
behind them and under the will the plaintiff will receive $35,000.
<P>

33   		I turn to the situation of Dawn Booth.  She is sixty-five
years of age. She is married and has no dependants.  She and her
husband are
pensioners.  Their present financial situation is that they are living in
Queensland, in Cambooya which is outside Toowoomba.
 They apparently have
thirteen acres and a house.  That is valued at $140,000.  They have a Magna car
worth $4,000, furniture of
$5,000, savings of $2,345 and a time-share unit.  At
this stage I should indicate that the plaintiff John also has a share in a
time-share
unit in the sum of $2,500.  
<P>

34   		The plaintiff Dawn Booth has liabilities which are
substantial.  There is a loan to AVCO of $85,000, a bankcard loan of $1500.
The loan from AVCO apparently resulted from a business which the plaintiff and
her husband were carrying on some time prior to going
on the pension.  That
business was apparently transferred to their son but they still retain a
liability of $85,000.  The finance
company will not release them from the
mortgage.  
<P>

35   		At the present time their son who is running the business
is paying the interest of $200 per week.  There is no guarantee
that he will
pay out the principal.  Accordingly they are in a somewhat precarious situation
in that regard. 
<P>

36   		They are both pensioners and their income plus cash work
is about $331.40.  That obviously hardly covers their expenses and
certainly
would not be sufficient if they had to meet $200 a week which their son is
meeting the interest on the loan.   They do
not know whether he will be able to
do anything about repaying the principal in the future.  
<P>

37   		Clearly the plaintiff has had a difficult life.  She and
her husband were effectively wiped out by the drought conditions
when they
moved to Temora.  There they lost a son-in-law and they had to re-start life in
Queensland.  That involved them also taking
up fresh businesses in order to
support their two children.  
<P>

38   		As far as her history with the deceased is concerned she
was like her sister.  She apparently had moved in 1952 to Oberon
to live.  She
did the same work on the farm as a child and it was in 1979 that she moved away
to Temora.  
<P>

39   		By 1989 that venture had failed and she moved to
Queensland.  No doubt the same comments that I made about the assistance
given
during her parents' illness also apply to this plaintiff.  She was no doubt a
good daughter to the deceased.  
<P>

40   		So far as the way in which she has been left without
adequate provision for her maintenance, education and advancement in
life is
concerned there is the obvious problem with the mortgage as she and her husband
have no means of repaying it or earning funds
to repay it.  
<P>

41   		Cross-examination demonstrated that her house needs some
work on it.  It needs painting, closing in underneath, new kitchen
cupboards,
floor coverings and the roof leaks and it needs repairs.  There is no estimates
of these amounts except that carpets will
cost $2,000.
<P>

42   		The plaintiff asks for a further amount of $50,000 to
$70,000 over and above the amount which she has been given under the
will.  
<P>

43   		It is also necessary for the court to give consideration
to other people who may have a claim on the bounty of the deceased.
 The first
of these to consider is the first defendant, Keith Evans.  He is aged
sixty-three.  He is married with no dependents.
 He lives in town in Oberon and
that home at 23 Bligh Street is owned free from encumbrances and it is worth
approximately $110,000.
 He has contents of some $5,000 and a Toyota sedan
worth $1500 and several thousand dollars of funds in different bank accounts.

<P>

44   		He still continues to operate the estate property as a
grazing property and to that end he has livestock which amounts to
668 ewes,
292 lambs, 18 rams, 23 cows, 24 calves, 6 steers and 2 bulls.  These were not
valued and on the evidence he has a Dodge
truck and a stock float worth $3,000.
Recently the vehicle which he used on the property was damaged and he will have
to replace
it using the proceeds of an insurance pay-out plus another $3,000 or
$4,000 in order to replace the vehicle.  He has an overdraft
on some $2,000-odd
at the moment and some $7,000 in savings.  His income situation is that he has
for many years, certainly since
1983, worked the property and also in earlier
years has done other work such as shearing.  His taxable income for the
financial year
ending 1998 was Nil and he expects his income for the current
year to be something under $20,000.  He has the expenses of running
the
property and maintaining his house and effectively he is not operating on an
economic basis.  He is virtually making no money
from the farm.  
<P>

45   		This is no doubt partly due to the rural situation and
probably more importantly the size of the property which is not large
enough
nowadays to support that operation.  His wife is employed and earns a salary of
$423.35. She has an expenditure of some $300
a week in maintaining the home and
meeting the household expenses.   She has a liability for a loan.  
<P>

46   		The defendant wishes to continue to operate the property,
whether that is appropriate needs to be considered in the light
of his
obligations as an executor.  The rent which is being paid means that the estate
is receiving a return on that property of
somewhere in the order of 1.5 per
cent per year.  
<P>

47   		The first defendant has been told by his mother, the
widow, that she wants the property to be kept and apparently she gets
some
enjoyment from it.  
<P>

48   		So far as his relationship with the deceased is
concerned, it is clear that he had a somewhat closer relationship than his
elder brother.  He was the youngest child and after the war he continued to
assist on the farm.  In about 1950 he had a position
with the Oberon Post
Office where he worked for about twelve months.  He still lived at home and he
made his way from his home to
Oberon for that job.   
<P>

49   		After that job finished he started to work with his
father.  He was not paid but he received board and keep.  He, like his
older
brother, became a shearer for three to six months a year.  When he was not
doing that work he continued to work on his father's
farm.  Exactly how much
time he worked there is not clear.  This continued for about eight years until
1961.  Occasionally when he
picked peas he would be paid the going rate for
such work.  
<P>

50   		In 1961 he married and moved into Oberon and also
continued to work as a shearer in the Oberon district.  He also spent time
at
this stage working on his father's farm.  
<P>

51   	In 1965, as I have mentioned, the deceased and his widow
went to England for seven month.  His father left him the responsibility
of
running the farm which he was happy to do.  Obviously it was something he
liked.  He did look after the farm during that period
and was paid twenty
pounds per week for looking after it.   The amount that he was paid probably
did not recompense him for the amount
of time that he had to give up to deal
with that situation.  He also mentioned the occasions during that time when his
sisters painted
the house.
<P>

52   		Apparently he continued this  work after the parents
returned and in 1983 the deceased had the tractor accident.  That then
led to
the lease proposal which was entered into between the deceased and the first
defendant.
<P>

53   		There was some dispute on the evidence about hay which
was left there which was taken over by the first defendant and also
superphosphate and some use no doubt was obtained from it.  At one stage the
deceased apparently gave the sum of $1,000 to the first
defendant to help him
purchase a motor vehicle.  
<P>

54   	There is also some evidence given as to work the first
defendant has done on the property.  There was approximately 1200 metres
of
fencing which was replaced.  That probably was something over and above the
requirement under the lease to maintain and keep the
property in good repair.
There was also general maintenance of course which was done pursuant to the
lease.  Some evidence was given
of other work to be done on the property and
the amounts which eventually were proved were moneys spent on superphosphate,
$501.50
aerial spraying $310, contract fencing $220, fencing material $317.50,
tractor repairs $4,024.50 and grading the road $75.   Most
of those I would
have thought would have been beyond the ordinary maintenance obligations which
applied under the lease.  It is important
to realise that it was Keith who was
the one who was close and who was able to assist his father in running the
property.  Although
the evidence was not in great detail it was clear that
there were many years of work in which there was assistance given.  	
<P>

55   		It is not of course for the defendant to establish any
need.  He is the chosen object of the testator's bounty and has the
interest in
remainder.  If he wishes to maintain the property, that is entirely a matter
for him.  It is obviously clearly uneconomical.
 
<P>

56   		The other person who has to be considered is perhaps the
most important person and that is the widow of the deceased, Hilda
Evans.  She
is ninety-three and is suffering from dementia.  Her present life expectancy,
absent any medical problems, is 3.67 years.
 At my request some evidence was
led by the first defendant as to the widow's situation.  She resides in
Hathaway Cottage at Oberon
which is a council-owned aged care facility with
twenty-four hour staffing.  She has a separate bedroom and an en suite
bathroom.
 She shares a community dining room and lounge room with other
visitors.  As I have mentioned she moved there in February 1997. 
She is almost
blind. She has lost the sight of one eye and has percentage vision in the other
eye.  On cloudy days she cannot see
but on a bright day she can see
sufficiently to make her way about.  Apparently her pension meets her expenses
at the Hathaway cottage
in Oberon.  As far as her assets are concerned she
apparently has $10,000 in an interest-bearing account with the National
Australia
Bank and $7,000 in a cheque account.   The description of those
matters which I have just recounted was the extent of the evidence.
 On enquiry
from Mr Evans it became clear that there was a possibility that in the future
she may need some other care.  The type
of accommodation that she is in at the
moment would not be suitable for someone who needs nursing in a nursing home.
Such facilities
are available in Bathurst and Lithgow.  There has not been any
investigation of the cost of those facilities although the first defendant
has
knowledge from other areas.  Apparently the expenses for such accommodation are
more expensive than her present accommodation
and it also might be that there
might need to be some capital contribution required if she is to move into
these other facilities.
<P>

57   		The evidence in respect of the widow's situation
unfortunately is not really sufficient for me to feel confident about her
future care.  Normally in matters such as this, one would have evidence from
her treating doctors and those who look after her to
talk about her needs and
future requirements.   That is simply not available.  In the present case the
plaintiffs have indicated
that they wish to receive provision and have asked to
be put ahead of the provisions made under the will for the widow.   The
question
which has to be considered by the court is what is appropriate in that
regard.  Widows' claims are frequently the subject of applications
in this
court.  The Court of Appeal in <b>Golosky  v  Golosky</b> (unreported 5 October
1993) has referred to the formulations of the standard to be expected in
respect of the widow in terms which
refer:
<P>

"Where the marriage of a deceased and his widow has been long and harmonious,
where the widow has loyally supported her husband
and assisted him to build up
and maintain his estate, the duty which a deceased owes to his widow can be no
less than to the extent
to which his assets permit him to achieve that result;
first to ensure that his widow be secure in her home for the rest of her life
and that if either the need arises or the whim strikes her she have the
capacity to change her home; secondly that she have available
to her an income
sufficient to enable her to live in a reasonable degree of comfort and free
from any financial worry; and, third,
that she have available to her a fund to
which she might have resort in order to provide herself with such modest
luxuries as she
might choose and which would provide her with a hedge against
any unforeseen contingency or disaster that life might bring".
<P>

58   		Here in this case of course the deceased and his widow
had a long life together.  It was not without its difficulties no
doubt for
them both.  It was obviously hard for the widow during wartime to look after
the property while her husband was away and
to look after the six young
children.  The provision that should be made for her is something akin to what
has been provided by the
deceased in his will.  Admittedly she does not need a
home to be provided for her but there is the possibility that some capital
sum
may be required to secure appropriate nursing care accommodation for her.
Fortunately the will does include a power which would
enable the executor to
use the estate assets, be they cash or property to provide that accommodation.

<P>

59   		When one looks at the needs of the children there is an
obvious difference.   That is that they are in their sixties and
their mother
is aged ninety-three.  The mother's life expectancy is short, although there
are possibilities of her living longer,
but she may not live that long.  Even
if the plaintiffs' situation in some way turns for the worse, one thing that
should be noted
is that their legacies are vested in interest and that they do
in fact have an entitlement once the widow dies to receive those funds.
 This
might assist them if there is some change in the next few years before their
mother dies.  
<P>

60   		However, it seems to me, particularly given the little
information that the court has in respect of the widow's situation,
that it
would be unwise to make any provision for payment of legacies for the
plaintiffs prior to her death.  However, a consideration
of the children's
circumstances certainly shows that they require further provision.   
<P>

61   		The circumstances of Dawn Booth, the first plaintiff, are
difficult.  She has a number of needs which I have identified in
the evidence.
In my view she would be entitled to receive after the death of her mother an
additional legacy of $60,000 over and
above what has been provided to her.  So
far as John Evans is concerned he has the debts to which I have referred.   In
my view he
should receive an additional $30,000 over and above the legacy.  So
far as Beulah Royle is concerned in my view no particular need
has been
established beyond what she receives under the will.  She has cash resources
and a block of land which is quite valuable.
 She will receive $35,000.   	
<P>

62   	Accordingly the orders that the court makes are:
<P>

1.	In lieu of the provisions in par.4(a)(i) of the will of the deceased, John
Henry Evans receive the sum of $40,000.
<P>

2.	That in lieu of the provision in par.4(c) of the will of the deceased that
Dawn Booth receive the sum of $95,000.
<P>

3.	So far as costs are concerned, the costs of the plaintiffs, John Evans and
Dawn Booth shall be paid out of the estate on a party
and party basis and the
costs of the defendants be paid or retained out of the estate on an indemnity
basis. 
<P>

4.	The exhibits are to be returned.
